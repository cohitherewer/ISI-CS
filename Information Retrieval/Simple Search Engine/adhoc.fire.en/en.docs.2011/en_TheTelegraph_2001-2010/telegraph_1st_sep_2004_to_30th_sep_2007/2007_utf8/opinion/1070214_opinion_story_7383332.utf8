 Ahead by miles

 Sir The report, 163-year lab lag with China (Feb 11), should open the eyes of the Indian government. In the past decade, the government has been busy pouring most of its resources into the information technology sector, thereby slowing down scientific research. Indian scientists are now either working in the IT industry or travelling to the West for research.This is mainly because of the fact that the infrastructure for education and scientific research is very poor in India. As a result, most students opt for professional courses, which help them get lucrative jobs. 

 Moreover, many countries, including Russia and China, offer opportunities to pursue higher education and research at a relatively low cost, prompting many Indian students to go abroad. Perhaps, the government should raise the amount of research grants and build adequately-equipped laboratories to prevent the best minds from leaving the country. On the academic front, it needs to modify the pay-scale for professors. These steps, one hopes, would attract more students in the science and technology sector. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir India and China are similar only in that they both have large populations, and that they both took a leap forward at the same time. However, the two did not land on the same spot. Besides, India and China differ significantly in their systems of governance as well as in terms of culture and ethnicity. Hence, any comparison between the two countries is quite pointless. If the argument were that China is ahead of India because of its economy, one ought to look at Taiwan and South Korea that practise a more open form of capitalism and have higher per capita incomes than China. We should accept the fact that the Chinese are more efficient than we are and that they will always be ahead of India.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir All this while, Indians were happy that they were only five decades behind the United States of America in technology. However, the fact that India needs 163 years to catch up with China, and that too only if China freezes its recruitment immediately, should make Indians step out of their comfort zone. It is true that India has lagged behind developed nations in research and per capita spending since independence. Now we know that our country is trailing even developing nations such as China. The prime minister and his Knowledge Commission certainly have a big task on their hands. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Bungling on

 Sir The Indian cricket teams performance in the second one-dayer against Sri Lanka was disappointing to say the least (Lanka hang in for 5-run win, Feb 12). It is time India stopped playing international cricket for a while. The break could be used by the players to sharpen their skills and acquire a degree of consistency. It is shocking to see the Indians lose a match that they should have won quite easily. Most Indian batsmen are poor runners between the wickets, while the bowlers are yet to master the art of precision bowling. These facts do not auger well for a team that claims to be a contender for the World Cup. A few changes, however, may help matters take a turn for the better. First, the selectors need to drop players who are out of form. A ban on cricketers featuring in endorsement campaigns should also be imposed. Finally, the selectors should think of a method to ensure accountability. For instance, if there are six specialist batsmen in the team, at least five of them should score above forty runs or miss the next match. Additionally, the team management must penalize bowlers for the wides and no-balls bowled. The real problem with our cricketers is that fame and money, early in their careers, appear to go to their heads. There is then a strong case for the board to invest in the all-round development of a players character.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Srinivasan, Calcutta 

 Sir While India rues the loss to Sri Lanka, nobody seems to have taken note of the fact that the biggest contributions to the Indian innings came from Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly, the two veterans in the side. This is not bad news in itself, since India expects these two, along with captain Rahul Dravid, to carry the team forward during the World Cup in the West Indies. But it is equally true that this raises certain uncomfortable questions about the future of the team. There is no guarantee that the Tendulkars and the Gangulys would be among runs in the Caribbean. Moreover, youngsters in the team have not been able to make the best use of the opportunities that have come their way. One can therefore safely conclude that Indian cricket seems altogether unable to shed its tradition of banking on old horses. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Dipankar Ray, Howrah

 Sir Indias 5-run defeat at the hands of Sri Lanka was solely due to Mahendra S. Dhonis failure to accelerate the run-rate in the last seven overs of the Indian innings. The Indian wicketkeeper cannot be excused because he had been in the middle for quite a while. By way of a penalty, he should be made to pay a hefty sum out of his endorsement contracts to cricket fans in India.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Bhattacharyya, Calcutta

 Parting shot 

 Sir The report, Helping hand for Pak soldier (Feb 11), proves that there can be lasting peace in the region if India and Pakistan decide to work together. The inhospitable terrain in Siachen has already proved costly to both governments in terms of lives and money. A stranded Pakistani soldier being rescued by Indian guards is certainly good news. But what about the fact that scores of poor fishermen, who unwittingly stray into rival territorial waters, are still taken captive and charged with serious crimes by authorities on both sides of the border?

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

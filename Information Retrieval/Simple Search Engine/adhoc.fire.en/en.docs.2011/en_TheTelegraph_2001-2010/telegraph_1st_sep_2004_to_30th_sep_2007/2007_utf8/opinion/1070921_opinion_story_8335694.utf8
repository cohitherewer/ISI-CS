 RETURN TO THE SIXTIES

 My Revolutions By Hari 

 Kunzru, 

 Penguin, pound;4.50

 It would be the ultimate escapist fantasy for some. But for Chris Carver, the narrator of My Revolutions, living under an assumed name, dissociated entirely from his past, is a condition of existence, not all that exciting either. At least, not so until he runs into an old acquaintance, Miles Bridgeman, one fine November afternoon in Chichester.

 Ever since their last meeting in London, more than three decades back, Chris has had a chequered life. Down and out in Europe, he had lived off the kindness of strangers or, failing that, had begged, borrowed and even stolen unabashedly. Finally, after four years in a monastery-cum-rehab in Thailand, he had returned home with a brand new name, Michael Frame. More splendidly, he had found, if not exactly bliss, then some kind of marital harmony with the beautiful Miranda Martin. Life with its banal but reassuring highs and lows had been kind so far, keeping him away from too much reality.

 Now, on the eve of his 50th birthday, Chris (or rather Mike, his present avatar) comes across Miles, and, more disturbingly, sees the ghost of his long-dead comrade and lover, Anna, walking the streets in broad daylight. Mike is profoundly unnerved, incredulous and in a state of bemused denial: In old cartoons, the Hanna Barbera shorts I used to watch as a child, Wile E. Coyote would frequently run off a cliff. When this happened, hed stop moving forward, his legs windmilling in the air, but it was only when he looked down that gravity started to work and he fell. 

 Unlike the indomitable Coyote, who emerged unhurt after each fall, Mike is devastated by the descent into his past. He spirals inescapably back to the Sixties, from where he is forced to resurrect Chris Carver, that very self he had renounced years ago. Even as Mike struggles to remain himself, he realizes that one is never just One but always already Many. So he decides to run away.

 Interlacing the here and the now with flashbacks, Hari Kunzru captures the anxiety of the narrators divided self. Unlike the linear progression of Kunzrus first novel, The Impressionist (where the protagonist, Pran Nath, reinvents himself no less than five times), My Revolutions juxtaposes the past with the present, and leaves just the hint of a sinister future lurking in the horizon. Kunzru combines the thrill of a sophisticated whodunnit with the breathless excitement of a cartoon show, and the result is far superior to his previous books.

 In this novel, Kunzru revisits, and then reinvents, his favourite themes. As in The Impressionist, here too he draws upon history substantially. The compulsive energy of Transmission is also there in this novel. But history, as used here, has nothing laboured or researched about it. The narrative style avoids obsessive documentation or a typical stream-of-conscious-cleverness and consequently becomes lusciously engaging. It is as if Kunzru finally comes of age as a writer, unburdened by the baggage of his ethnic identity. The evidence of this change is there in a recent interview: I think the publishing industry in the UK is beginning to accept that Asian writers are exploring territory that has nothing to do with race, culture or tradition.

 Admittedly, Kunzru chooses an unfashionable and relatively unexplored terrain. Michael Frame, in this novel, recounts his life as a revolutionary during the heady Sixties. Born as Chris Carver to a hopelessly suburban English family, he spent his boyhood in an oedipal tangle with the mad mother cowering in the attic and the big bully of a father hovering around. Then LSE happens to him, shortly followed by LSD, the radicalism and then the revolution. His clandestine interest in university politics, anti-Vietnam rallies and trade unionism soon turns into serious involvement in political conspiracies, terrorist attacks and organized crime of course, all for a just cause.

 There is an enchanting social realism in the way Kunzru brings alive the Sixties bohemianism in Britain. Moving beyond the stereotype of the revolutionary zealot, he introduces respectable Eton and Harrow boys, puzzled by the times and willing to wager their social uppitiness. True-born English roses turn into aggressive Blue Stockings, free-thinking, free-loving anarchists.The most memorable in this odd social menagerie are the arrogant Sean, the wily Leo and the mad Ursula, who spoke volubly of her past incarnations, which included an iron-age priestess, Charlotte Bront and a peasant girl whod died in a workhouse.

 Chris Carver survives this fragile world only to be hounded in the next, in post-revolution, globalized Britain, where everything looked like an advertisement. After myriad revolutions political, geographical and metaphysical he is blackmailed by Miles for intelligence on his Sixties comrades, forcing Michael Frame to become Chris Carver once again. 

 This transformation happens at an enormous personal cost. After several agonizing weeks when Miranda finally gets a call from her run-away husband, she gasps, Oh God. Mike? Where are you? But the voice at the other end answers, Chris. My names Chris. And then he is heard no more.

 KEEPING SAFE DISTANCE 

 ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA

 FIFTH COLUMN 

 Perhaps it would not be too far-fetched 

 to say that the aerial attack of the Liberation Tigers of 

 Tamil Eelam on the Katunayake airbase in Sri Lanka repeats 

 Hanumans feat in the island country. But that is not Sri 

 Lankas only connection with India. Tamils are the biggest 

 ethnic group in the country. Besides the undeniable historical 

 link, there is also the geographical proximity to India, 

 which allows for the pan-Tamil culture to transcend the 

 borders between the two countries.

 India, as usual, is squarely held 

 responsible for being the root of all evils be it in Bangladesh, 

 where India definitely played a major part in the formation 

 of the linguistic state, or in Nepal, where the Maoists 

 links across the border has been a major concern both for 

 New Delhi and Kathmandu. But there are other linkages as 

 well. For example, the Punjabi biradari in Ludhiana 

 and Lahore between the Singhs and Sharifs. Khalistan, Kashmir 

 or Kalashnikov has not been able to destroy this bond. 

 In the case of Sri Lanka, however, 

 India seems to be in a catch-22 situation. It can neither 

 help the Sri Lankan government nor oppose it. In 1971, India 

 could openly confront Pakistan for its atrocities and support 

 the dissident Bengalis of the then East Pakistan, even risking 

 the rise of similar Bengali irredentist activities on both 

 sides of the border. But things changed drastically with 

 the Khalistan movement and the beginning of the Kashmir 

 turmoil in the Eighties. Besides, the North-east continued 

 to boil and the Naxalite movement gathered momentum. 

 Face to face

 Much of these problems remain. 

 Thus, India cannot but follow a policy in tune with international 

 law and conventions that clearly spell out that Sri Lankas 

 sovereignty cannot be compromised by a friendly sovereign 

 neighbour like India.

 Unlike the people of Bengal or 

 Punjab, who were victims of Partition and the bloodshed 

 that followed, Indian Tamils have had no such traumatic 

 experience. However, this lack of experience is no guarantee 

 that there will be no intense emotional bond felt with the 

 Sri Lankan Tamils. The emotions may even be powerful enough 

 to plunge India once again into a cauldron of disaffection 

 against the neighbour.

 However, it needs to be said that 

 notwithstanding the fraternal ties between the Bengalis 

 of Delhi and Dacca, the extra-territorial bond between the 

 two Bengals is no longer a reality. It is a similar case 

 with East Punjab and west Pindi, parts of the former kingdom 

 of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

 In the case of Sri Lanka, the 

 internal dynamics of the Indian polity clearly overrides 

 the urge for action against forces inimical to the sovereignty 

 of a friendly neighbour. What could be done in 1987 cannot 

 be repeated in 2007. Those were the halcyon days of a unitary 

 party with an absolute majority. 

 Like New Delhi, Lankas hands 

 too appear tied. Colombo could either talk to the LTTE or 

 seek military assistance from sources other than India. 

 Since the LTTE aerial attack was so brazen and brave, any 

 talk of peace certainly appears remote at present. Lanka 

 surely would seek help from other Asian nations.

 An unpleasant fallout of the LTTE 

 aerial attack could be a drive towards acquisition of air 

 power among terrorist groups waging war against India. The 

 LTTE seem to have used a Czech-made aircraft for the attack. 

 This only buttresses the fact that the dissolution of the 

 Soviet Union has made it possible for a lot of arms and 

 ammunition to pass into wrong hands. Both Czechoslovakia 

 and Yugoslavia were known for their expertise in small arms 

 technology. One needs to carefully watch the unfolding scenario 

 down south. Today it is air assault. Tomorrow it could be 

 a full-blown, unprecedented, unconventional civil war.

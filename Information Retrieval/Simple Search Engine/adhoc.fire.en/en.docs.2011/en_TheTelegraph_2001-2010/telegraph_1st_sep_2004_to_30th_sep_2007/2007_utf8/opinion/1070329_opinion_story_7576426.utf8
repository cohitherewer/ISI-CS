 GROW WINGS TO SOAR HIGHER

 ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA

 Like the aircraft manufacturing industry, the biennial Indian air shows too are way behind the worlds leading aviation jamborees, such as the UKs Farnborough and Frances Le Bourget. Nevertheless, Aero-India 2007 was expected to be a big affair, with the Farnborough experts roped in. The list showed 33 foreign participants, a few hundred companies and top-of-the-line combat aircraft. The show clearly put Indian aviation on the global map. 

 The glitz notwithstanding, Aero-India could perhaps consider a few points for the next show in 2009. An event of a dimension as the Farnborough or Le Bourget, by definition and design, is an air show and not an air force show. The Bangalore airbase,Yelahanka, caters mostly to the Indian air force, as does Farnborough to the Royal air force. Dubai and Singapore, on the other hand, are one city-one airport states whose airports handle both civil and military flights. Yet, obstacles in air shows outside India once the visitor is inside the arena are found to be much less than in India.

 The forenoon session on the opening day of the air show in Yelahanka was truly spectacular. Unfortunately, things went awry on the second day with IAF officers taking command of their base and trying to discipline even some bona fide participants of the show. They had their own rules for the press, guests and visitors, notwithstanding the previously-issued passes. Most surprising was the presence of family members of the IAF men, with children in tow. Yet, the child of the chairman-cum-managing director of one of the leading civil aviation operators of India was denied admission. 

 It is not that the IAF men were not doing their job. Most, in fact, did a splendid job. But when it comes to such high-visibility international events, it is imperative that the performance of the armed forces appear to be impeccable.

 Taking the lead

 Bangalore, quite clearly, runs the show so far as Indian aviation is concerned. A new international airport is coming up at Devanahalli. The existing airport would then be better placed, given the additional facility of the HAL airstrip in the vicinity, to hold an air show. 

 The strongest motivating factor for an air show is economics. Singapore and Dubai shows, given their size, allow operators to be close to the happening place. Farnborough and Le Bourget are far away from the respective cities, but since both London and Paris are attractive destinations, the lure of the air shows is unlikely to diminish in the near future. In India, New Delhi is considered to be a difficult market. Hence it possibly cannot be a happy hunting ground for quick-buck operators.

 Seen in this broad perspective, Aero-India 2007 was an unprecedented success. However, one must concede that the high profile IAF men at Yelahanka, along with the machines in display, showed that the Aero-India is a military, and not a civil aviation, show. One, therefore, is slightly apprehensive of the future of Aero-India as Indians are usually not comfortable with defence matters. Defence studies hardly exist on the curriculum of educational institutions. Unlike in the US, there are only a few study groups on Indian defence. The lack of open debate and discussion makes the subject a taboo. Defence in India cannot be questioned, probed or analysed in the public platform. 

 If air shows are to be held, then genuine visitors cannot be treated as suspects nor bona fide invitees be subjected to martial law. It is time to shift gear and venue from an Indian air force base to the existing non-air force Bangalore airport, which, hopefully, will play the new role to the satisfaction of the media, invitees, guests and the handful of aviation buffs in India.

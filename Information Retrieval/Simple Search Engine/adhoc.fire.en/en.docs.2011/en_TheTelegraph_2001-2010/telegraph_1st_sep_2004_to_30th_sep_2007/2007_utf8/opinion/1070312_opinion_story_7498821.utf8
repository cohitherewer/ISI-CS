 GETTING THERE, SLOWLY

 Gwynne Dyer

 The most extreme diagnosis of Italys problem was offered by Peter Popham in the Independent. He blamed it all on the Vatican: Imagine that Hitler did not die in his bunker in 1945 but instead cut a deal with the new West German government, giving him continued sovereignty over a small patch of Berlin and continued intellectual hegemony over the millions he had brainwashed during the previous decade....Italys Vatican problem is a lot like that, with the difference that the Church has been wielding its mind-control for nearly two millennia.

 The trigger for this extraordinary outburst was the week-long political crisis that nearly brought down Romano Prodis centre-left government. Yet Popham is not anti-Catholic. Its just that, like most people who spend a lot of time in Italy, he has simultaneously fallen in love with the country and utterly lost patience with it.

 Its an affliction he shares with a great many Italians: no country except Argentina spends more time debating what is wrong with it. He blamed the Vatican on this occasion because the crisis was provoked by a government plan to legalize civil unions even for gays, which greatly annoyed the Catholic Church. But its more complicated than that.

 The vote that Prodis government lost was actually on a proposal to leave 1,900 Italian troops in Afghanistan until 2011 and to double the size of an American military base outside Vicenza. Both projects are very unpopular in Italy, but they were part of the deal that created the nine-party coalition behind the government.

 Surprise vote

 The government would have won the vote if senator-for-life, Giulio Andreotti, had not unexpectedly voted against it. But Andreotti, seven times prime minister, is a strong supporter of Nato and the American alliance, so why would he vote against that bill? Because it was going to be so close that his surprise no vote could bring Prodis government down.

 Why would he want to do that? Andreotti has always been very close to both the Church and the mafia, but on this occasion, it was the former that mattered. The Vatican wanted to kill the civil union proposal, which required killing Prodis government. Andreotti just seized the opportunity. It worked, too: a week later, Prodi managed to revive his coalition government, but this time their agreed programme does not include the civil union project.

 Most Italians would agree that there is something wrong with their country, but its not the Church that bothers them. The stagnant economy makes matters worse, but there is an underlying sense of frustration that permeates Italian life.

 For almost forty years after 1945, while the rest of Europe was growing and changing, Italy grew but didnt change, because politics and all of society were frozen in a deeply conservative and profoundly corrupt pattern. In order to keep the communists from winning power and taking Italy out of Nato, the Christian Democratic Party had to be kept in power permanently and it was, thanks to foreign money and foreign intelligence services, to its alliance with the Catholic Church, and to its other alliance with the mafia.

 That system ended fifteen years ago, when the Christian Democrats imploded in a blizzard of scandals, and communism went out of fashion, but Italians have a lot of lost time to make up. Also, the decision to swap the lira for the euro was a disaster for Italy, because it lost the ability to remain competitive by continually devaluing its currency. Italian politics is still poisonous and the justice system is a joke.

 But that is what youd expect at this stage of modernization, because it is a process, and it takes time. Spain is about thirty years into a similar process, dating from the death of Franco and the end of fascism. It is feeling the strain, but it will probably get there in the end.

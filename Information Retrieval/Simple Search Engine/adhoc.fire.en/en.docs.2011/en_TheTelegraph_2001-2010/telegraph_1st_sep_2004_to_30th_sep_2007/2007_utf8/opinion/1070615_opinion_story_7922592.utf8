 BUILD UP

 India is shining. It is scoring so many worlds firsts. Amongst them is futures trading in cement, to start which the National Commodities and Derivatives Exchange has asked the permission of the Forward Markets Commission. How brilliant! How innovative! However, a small voice would like to ask: but why? If the rest of the world never started cement futures in its millennia-long history, it was not because no human had the intelligence of the 21st-century Indian. It was because the idea was senseless. Cement can be produced only where calcium carbonate is available; its commonest source is limestone deposits, which are not too widespread. There are considerable economies of scale in cement production; that limits the number of plants. And it is bulky; its high transport costs limit the number of producers who can compete for the market in any area. All these characteristics ensure oligopoly; and wherever producers command large shares of the market and have competitors, their price policies tend to converge. Producers tend to keep prices stable; and if prices are stable, there cannot be any profit in guessing future prices. Hence cement futures have always been a non-starter. 

 Why, then, does India promise to be the sole exception? It is because demand for cement is rising fast, and there are doubts about whether producers will continue to build enough capacity to meet it. At any rate, there are likely to be periods when demand outpaces capacity and vice versa. This summer was one such period; cement went out of the market, and builders had to scramble around, especially in the east and the north, to ensure that their projects did not come to a halt. Since the National Highways Authority of India is not market-savvy, most of its projects have ground to a halt. The government removed import duty on cement in March. It also made a ham-handed attempt to persuade cement producers to keep prices down by means of a differential excise duty; but gave it up when it invited much ridicule. For now, it has exhausted all its ammunition, and is unlikely to interfere with cement pricing. 

 Whilst the industry is planning over 100 million tons of additional capacity, this is not going to materialize in the near future. So, further price increases are likely in the coming building season. Speculation on cement prices is a one-sided bet. This is what made cement futures attractive to NCDEX. The speculators are safe except for one factor, namely, that the construction boom may collapse. Overcapacity is looming in a number of cities, and property prices have begun to crumble. Sooner or later, every construction boom turns into a slump; the only question just now is when. But that perhaps adds spice to cement futures; the greater the uncertainty, the greater the turnover in a futures market; and turnover is what makes a futures market.

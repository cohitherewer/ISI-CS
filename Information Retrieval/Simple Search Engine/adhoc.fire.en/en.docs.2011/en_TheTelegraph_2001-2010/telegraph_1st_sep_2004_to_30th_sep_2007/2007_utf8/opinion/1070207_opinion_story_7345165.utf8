 RULED BY REASON

 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES

 Pity the preposition. Few words are as often, and increasingly, ill-treated as those useful maids-of-all-work such as at, with, to, by, for, from and their like.

 For a start, Victorian pseudo-pedants invented a rule that such humble words werent fit for any gentleman to end a sentence with. Who dreamed this rule up? Where did it come from? What, except the dreamers self-satisfaction, was it for? As every earlier sentence in this paragraph shows, its claptrap.

 One or two prepositions have had their use restricted by well-intentioned zeal for uniformity of spelling. Newspaper style-books like to say we hacks must always write toward, not towards (or vice versa). That is their editors right. But for private use Id pick whichever sounds better in the phrase concerned: towards evening, for instance, but toward sunset.

 More harmful is the rule that you can write into or in to, depending on the sense, but onto always as a single word. Not so. Onto and on to can have different senses just as into/in to can. The flagpole goes into the ground, and the flag onto the flagpole. But you hand your resignation in to your department head and he passes it on to the personnel office. If you doubt the distinction, try we walked on to/onto the swamp. Do you mean you continued walking till you reached the swamp, or that having done so you set foot on it and were swallowed up? (And while were on spelling, till is just as good as until, and those who apologetically write til to show they know proper English merely reveal that they dont.)

 But it isnt pedantry that is the real risk to prepositions today. Its a lack of it; or, as I would say, a lack of elementary respect for the language. Above all in sports journalism, but not only there, we British constantly use the wrong preposition.

 Anything doesnt go

 This isnt the old tale of transatlantic disagreement. Americans use more prepositions than we do: visit with and consult with, free up and head up, outside of, for example, and more. I detest these usages when theyre imported into British writing, but theyre Americas right. No, our trouble is sheer ignorance of our own usage.

 Some uses can legitimately vary. I always write different from; many people say, or also say, different to, and Jane Austen was one. Between is normal when only two people or things are involved, among when more than two. But between can go wider: as mass murderers, there was little to chose between Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot. You are angry with a person but at his misdeeds; you travel on foot but by train. Some variations imply subtle differences of meaning: insults in themselves do no harm is not exactly the same as by themselves.

 More often, however, there is no choice. Yet any British sports page any weekend will tell you of Manchester Uniteds defeat to Arsenal. Read by. Many a commentator is bored of Englands excuses for losing in Australia. Dont ask me why bored with, fed up with and tired of are right and anything else (at, for common example) is wrong. But so it is.

 Theres worse than that. My sports memorabilia include such barbarisms as meetings from those concerned and anxious moments by the players (read among). Likewise Montoyas challenge on Schumacher, and many more.

 Sports journos arent the only culprits, however. Ive met bored of in Britains grandest papers. Likewise the sense of fear from Tory MPs; Airbus and Boeing square off (read up); British Rail, a symbol for British inefficiency; imports by Russia, when the writer clearly meant from; even Bank governor fears threat to inflation.

 I could go on: there are plenty more where those came from. At least the Victorian pedants contempt for prepositions has been overcome. But why replace it with the 21st centurys anything-goes contempt for precision?

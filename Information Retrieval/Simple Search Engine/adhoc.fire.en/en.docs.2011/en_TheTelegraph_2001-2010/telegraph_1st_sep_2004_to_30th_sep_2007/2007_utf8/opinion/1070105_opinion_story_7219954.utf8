The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 KILL THE GREEN

 Falstaff died babbling of green fields. So will Calcutta, if the citys benighted keepers are allowed to have their way. The question is, who will stop the Book Fair from irreversibly ravaging the Maidan every year? And the one that follows immediately from this should be, is it just the Book fair and its organizers who are implicated in this annual rampage on the green? The answers lead directly to the heart of the citys civic crisis, and to some dangerous trends in Bengals governance and administration. The peculiar mix of callousness, conservatism and high-handedness that characterizes the annual debate over the Book Fairs venue has now become part of the citys culture, in which the chief ministers stakes are famously high. So, every year, the army, which is technically the keeper of the green, puts in its token fight against its property being stubbornly ruined by the fair and its book-loving patrons. The state government inevitably arbitrates, gets more powerful people in Delhi to put pressure on the army to relent. The army relents, the fair takes place, the people come and buy books, gormandize, litter, trample on the grass and relieve themselves. And then the fair ends, leaving the Maidan dirty and pitted, its turf ruined and the branches of its trees thoughtlessly lopped off. Tradition is thus reaffirmed this is all for the sake of books, after all.

 This year, too, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild has claimed that five bodies, crucial to the welfare of the city, are duty-bound to assist the guild hold the fair on its original venue. These bodies are the state government, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the fire services department, the state pollution control board and the army. The state government has already shown its hand in dealing with the matter. After invoking, for a while, the alternative fairground by the bypass, it admitted that this fairgrounds completion was lagging hopelessly behind schedule, and then made it quite clear that even if it did get built eventually, the fair would still take place on the Maidan for the sake of tradition and popular enthusiasm. This was expected. The Left Front government never thinks twice before allowing the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to hold its rallies on the Brigade Parade Grounds. Meanwhile, the high court looks on helplessly and the city dies a little.

 BRING ON THE YOUTH

 Malvika Singh

 India seems to have become the flavour of the year in countries of the West. Magazines and newspapers are doing endless pieces on food and eating, on places to visit, on where to shop and how to unwind with the music from Bollywood! The limitless contradictions of this land continue to overwhelm us as they change avatars and develop new contours, some exhilarating and others disturbing. At the contemporary cultural end, there is great energy, a fresh vitality and much experimentation that represent the majority youth force of India. It is on the move, making its own space within a confused and rather anarchic environment, remaining silent for the moment on issues of society and politics, waiting for an appropriate time to enter the field and diffuse the old guard that has held change to ransom.

 Even the look and feel of the politics of the last sixty years have begun to pall. It is all the same old nonsense of presenting the predictable half truths, flouting with authority, continuing with the chronic inability to hear and do, and constantly finding lame, putrid and unacceptable explanations in an attempt to rationalize irregularities and bad decisions. Leaders look the same, behave in the same manner, and seem to have similar aspirations and motivations, regardless of party and ideology. Parliamentarians are a newly-constituted tribe that has put together a set of rules that governs them and their cronies at the cost of all other groups and classes of citizens. They seem to have been born reserved.

 Promises belied

 Soon we shall see the brother of Manmohan Singh fighting an election in Punjab, the start of yet another political family. Amarinder Singh will most definitely release a ticket for the brother, and an IOU that will draw our prime minister into playing at politics, a game he had hitherto kept at bay. He was seen to be different. A temporary incumbent, who would be the bridge for the next generation, helping them to cross over to the other side and enter the sacred space of government and restore clean, appropriate governance. This was obviously a dream some of us had had, an illusion that we believed may change the prevailing political modus operandi and herald an exciting phase in public life that would energize Bharat and India for the next few decades.

 India probably has the largest number of citizens below the age of forty. We are therefore poised to play a critical role in world policy, in economic partnerships, in working out new mechanisms for dynamic diplomatic, political, economic, cultural and social exchanges that are disconnected from the baggage of the last sixty years. New thinking, new challenges, new alignments and a belief in multiculturalism and pluralism, truths that make India unique and special, could reinforce civilized responses and relations with diverse and complicated cultures across the world. Our experience could be brought into the international arena.

 For this to happen, we need to actively dispense with the straggly remains of bad politics and malgovernance. We must put pressure on the political and administrative establishment to hand over the baton. Experience comes with doing, with making mistakes and having the wherewithal to rectify them. It does not come with age. Age brings redundant, frayed baggage that is comfortable and soft. Youth takes on challenges, adds new dimensions to thinking and doing, and changes the course.

 Are we going to celebrate sixty years of independence with eulogizing the dead and gone or by saluting the young? Will our ancient, infirm leaders whine on with their oft-repeated platitudes as they stick to their gaddis, or will they have the grace and magnanimity to pass the baton and keep a watchful eye on their most valuable national resource, the young men and women of Bharat?

 Letters to Editor

 How to say goodbye

 Sir For Indians, watching the BBC coverage of Tony Blairs last day at the House of Commons must have been an interesting experience. It was the parliamentary system of a civilized nation at its very best behaviour bidding a dignified farewell to the outgoing prime minister without letting any rancour or animosity get in the way. A videotape of this programme should be replayed for all the MPs and MLAs of India so that they could have some idea of the etiquettes that are generally observed in any civilized parliament in the world.

 Yours faithfully,

 Imtiaz Chowdhry, Calcutta

 Star shines bright

 Sir The resounding success of Sivaji The Boss in the southern states can be explained in terms of Rajnikanths massive popularity in these states. But the so-called ripples in the rest of the country have more to do with a hyperactive media imagination than the film itself (All heads bow to the boss, June 26). Usually the voice of sanity in the Indian media circus,the English media, especially the television channels, have gone overboard with what they call the Rajni phenomenon. Perfectly unsuspecting viewers were treated to visuals of Rajnikanth fans wildly gyrating or mimicking the queer mannerisms of their hero.

 The media in Bengal should focus on the Tollygunge film industry instead. Sivaji, after all, belongs to the same genre as the loud, over-the-top films produced here, with the sole difference that Rs 65 crore was spent on it. Sadly, our very own Mithunda or Prosenjit, who can match Rajnikanth skill for skill, still cannot inspire similar frenzy.

 Yours faithfully,

Susobhan Sarkar, Sonarpur

 Sir The box-office hit of the southern superstar Rajnikanths Sivaji The Boss proves that there is still a sizeable audience to watch films in theatres. It must be because of the star-qualities of Rajnikanth that he has made a successful comeback after almost two years in spite of the running ebb in the Tamil film industry. The superstars simplicity and his respect and care for each unit member are the pillars of his success. The triumph of Sivaji has ushered in a new hope among film producers who were otherwise planning to look for an alternative source of living. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Nalco Nagar, Orissa

 Sir Although there is nothing to suggest that Rajnikanth had anything to do with it, the selling of Sivaji The Bosss TV rights to Kalaignar TV inevitably gives a partisan taint to the superstars name (Rajni caught in channel clash, June 1). Kalaignar TV is now popularly considered to be the Karunanidhi familys and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams fiefdom. Given his non-partisan record so far, Rajnikanth should not have allowed this move to tarnish his image now.

 Yours faithfully,

Swagata Ghosh, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir With the sound and fury that fill the rhetoric of our home-grown Marxists every time they have to talk about the United States of America, it feels funny to know that they actually have a deep love for that country. Or why would our Marxist leaders go to America every so often, choosing the capitalist Mecca over socialist states like North Korea, China or Cuba? After two politburo members returned from the US, it is now Biman Boses turn to make a trip (Party prepares for the worst, June 29). Since Bose is not part of a government delegation, one feels even more tempted to ask: Why America, comrade? Perhaps he is aware that there is hardly the kind of freedom and splendour in the communist countries as there is in the US.

 Yours faithfully,

 Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

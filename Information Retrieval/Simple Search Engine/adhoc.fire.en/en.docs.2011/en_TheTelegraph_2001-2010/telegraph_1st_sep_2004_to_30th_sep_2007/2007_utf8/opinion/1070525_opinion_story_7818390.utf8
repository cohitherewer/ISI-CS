 Letters to Editor

 A suitable man

 Sir In Top of the class (May 21), S.L. Rao has shown how the post of the president has been exploited, time and again, by political parties. With a change of guard imminent in the highest national office, both the United Progressive Alliance and the National Democratic Alliance are now engaged in hectic lobbying to send a man of their choice to the Rashtrapati Bhavan. However, the resounding victory of Mayavati in the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls has complicated matters by making the Bahujan Samaj Party a key player in the presidential polls. Both national alliances are now desperate to gain the BSPs allegiance. The rivalry between the UPA and the NDA has thrown up a fractured mandate. The names of prospective candidates, all political heavyweights, make it clear that political allegiance will play a crucial role in the election. 

 The UPA or the NDA may get their man at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, but it will not reflect the choice of the people. The president, despite being a titular head of State, plays a crucial role in government-formation at the Centre. This explains the enthusiasm among parties to get a president of their choice. Perhaps it is time to reconsider the presidential election process. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir All the prospective candidates for the presidency of the Indian republic are hardcore politicians. Not one of them is likely to be an independent and neutral upholder of the Constitution. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for such a president to override his political past and ignore the pressure exerted on him by his political electors. It is sad that an exemplary president like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam cannot continue for a second term. Kalam, during his tenure, earned the respect of all. He has not only applied his unbiased judgment, but also complied with constitutional provisions, as evident in the office of profit controversy. The corruption in Indian politics is preventing Kalam from getting a second term in office. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has been a near-perfect head of State. The fact that Kalam has hardly ever been seen at the Rashtrapati Bhavan during his presidential tenure testifies to his tireless efforts at helping his countrymen. He has toured the entire length and breadth of India and associated himself with one and all. Kalam has been a responsible first citizen. He has shown the same commitment as did Rajendra Prasad and S. Radhakrishnan. Unlike our politicians, the current incumbent at the Rashtrapati Bhavan has attached himself to both faces of India the one making multi-million dollar business acquisitions abroad and the one struggling below the poverty line at home. Whoever succeeds Kalam will find it difficult to attain his stature.

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir Many bright personalities have held the office of the president of India since independence. It is unfortunate that not one of them has been able to leave any imprint on the history of the nation. The question being raised at present is about the desirability of having a woman as president of India. However, before answering this question, one needs to ask whether India needs a president at all. The United States of America has only one first citizen the president. The constituent states have one first citizen the governor. India has two de facto first citizens the president and the prime minister. Similarly, Indian states have the governor and the chief minister. The titular posts of the president and the governor are of little use, as their holders possess no real power. India, in fact, cannot afford the luxury of having so many first citizens. Under the circumstances, it does not matter whether India has a politician or an intellectual, a man or a woman, as president. Nothing short of a Houdini as president would change things in this country. Only a magician would manage to escape the tentacles of political parties and work in the true interests of the ordinary citizens of India. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir One thing that the political parties should not forget in their haste to elect a man of their choice is to ensure that a better-looking gentleman enters the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Sinha, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir Indian football can be rescued from its dismal state only if there is more investment in infrastructure and better training modules (Brazil to play soccer saviour, May 23). The collaboration with Brazil may well be the start of a revolution. However, the Indian football think-tank must encourage and adequately nurture domestic talent. Indian youngsters must be provided with the opportunity to play with and against the best in the business. Tours by Brazilians and tours in Brazil for Indian footballers as well as the training of coaches at Brazilian academies should foster quality football on Indian soil. Additionally, Indian soccer clubs must stop the practice of inviting and recruiting third- and fourth-grade foreign players. If India is serious about reviving football and moving up from its present rank of 165, it should see that talented local players are provided a proper support system, training, nutrition and financial security. It is also necessary to free Indian soccer from its bureaucratic entanglements. 

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Gupta, Bandel, Hooghly

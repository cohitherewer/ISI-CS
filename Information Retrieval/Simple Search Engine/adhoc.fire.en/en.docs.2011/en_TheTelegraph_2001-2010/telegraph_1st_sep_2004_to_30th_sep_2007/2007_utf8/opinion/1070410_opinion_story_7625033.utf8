 NOTHING IS ABOVE BOARD AND NEVER WILL BE

 The BCCI is a body that controls cricketers and their money, and plays with the interests of Indian cricket, writes Uddalak Mukherjee

 Questions without answers

 A month is a long time in Indian cricket. In early March, as the Indian team reached Mumbai airport to catch a flight for the West Indies, excited fans urged them on, confident that the boys would bring the Cup home. A soft drink company also ran a commercial showing six Indian cricketers miraculously turning into growling tigers ambling onto the pitch before a match. The message was symbolic, but uncomplicated. It asked opponents to stay clear of these mercurial cricketers, who were on a quest for glory.

 Later in the month, when the team returned after a dismal campaign, the picture had changed considerably. The players could not step out of doors without the protection of gun-toting policemen. The fans remained hysterical, but now, there was a dangerous edge to their frenzy. The cola advertisement too had disappeared from the screens.

 As if irate fans and disgruntled brand managers were not enough, Indian cricketers now have to contend with a vengeful cricket board as well. Some form of post-mortem of the World Cup debacle, followed by a change of captain or coach or both, was expected from the Board of Control for Cricket in India. But not the kind of sweeping changes that the working committee of the BCCI announced when it met in Mumbai last Saturday. The board feels that the chopping and changing was necessary to rid Indian cricket of its many ills. But isnt the board itself a major component of these ills? It is a sick system whose first instinct after a first-round loss at the World Cup is to reinforce the control of its administrators and officials over the players, and their money. 

 The decisions of the BCCI working committee have been discussed threadbare, in the media and elsewhere. But there still remains a set of critical questions that needs to be raised in the light of this development: whom does the cricket board of India really represent? Is the board a representative of the cricketers, as it has been claimed on numerous occasions? More importantly, does the board serve the interests of cricket in India at all? 

 The answer to the first cannot possibly be in the affirmative. Technically speaking, professional cricketers in India are employees of the board. As an employer, the board has every right to penalize them for a poor showing. By this logic, the board is perfectly justified in linking payments to players performance. But then, why was the gradation system followed all this while, making a players seniority the deciding factor in his payments ? Does the BCCI, by abolishing the gradation system in this meeting, mean to say that performance was not of any importance till now? That could explain the Indian teams habitual under-performance in important tournaments.

 The decision to limit the number of endorsements per player to not more than three products would still defy all logic unless it can be conclusively proved that a cricketers commercial commitments have a bearing on his performance on the field. No amount of data-crunching can help prove this, not even if Messrs Duckworth and Lewis are put on the job. The board knows this, and hence the hints of backtracking, only 24 hours later. 

 It is in the nature of an unprofessional organization like the BCCI and perhaps of Indians as a race to overlook all excesses and wish away every brewing problem as long as the team is winning. Most players in the team which went to the World Cup finals in 2003 endorsed one or more brands. And it is not as if cricketers alone have gained monetarily from these endorsements. The board has also filled up its coffers by milking the players. Try and imagine a situation where a Pepsi or a Sahara is shovelling money into the BCCI treasury even after being told that Sharad Pawar, Niranjan Shah, Ratnakar Shetty et al and not Dravid, Tendulkar, Dhoni amp; Co. would appear in the commercials. 

 Consider some other demands on the Indian cricketers. Every so often they are made to play benefit and exhibition matches organized by the board, over and above their international fixtures. Why did the board not talk about cutting down on these matches, and streamlining a jampacked annual calendar if it really wanted the players to devote more time to domestic cricket? To expect them to play Ranji Trophy matches a day after returning from gruelling, month-long overseas tours is to behave more cruelly than Simon Legree. But that is exactly how the board is irrational, mean, and vengeful, not ashamed of tightening the purse-strings of its players without limiting its own income. 

 The truth is that the relationship between the board and the players has always been fragile. Eighteen years ago, it had even tried unsuccessfully to ban six cricketers for playing exhibition matches in the United States of America and Canada. For all the outward gestures vice-president (east) Rajeev Shukla recently claimed that the BCCI has never shut its door on the players it is clear that things havent changed one bit. If they had, players would not have felt the need, as they do from time to time, to have an association to look after their own interests. 

 The level of corruption and politicking within the board and around it are reflected in the decision to stop cricketers from holding exclusive media contracts. It goes without saying that the boards attempts to gag the players, denying them an opportunity to present their case to the public, is harsh and undemocratic, but no one expects the BCCI to be understanding and democratic any longer. A more interesting move is to exempt the captain from this draconian measure. Would the decision have been the same if Sourav Ganguly, instead of Dravid, had been the captain? Unlikely. The board knows that Dravid is the last person to embarrass the board with his pen. Dravids email, sent on Sunday, should put any doubts on this matter to rest.

 It is difficult to furnish a single argument in favour of the motion that the Indian cricket board represents the interests of Indian cricket. Some experts have lauded the board for its attempts to strengthen domestic cricket: state associations have now been directed to prepare lively tracks; affiliated units have been asked to start their own academies; zonal representation is also likely to make way for a full-time selection committee with a shelf-life of two years. 

 However, a closer scrutiny will reveal that there is nothing new about any of these measures. Most of them are purely cosmetic in nature. The board has been croaking about changing the nature of Indian pitches since the end of the Nineties, to enable our batsmen cope with tracks outside the subcontinent. It formed a pitches committee in 1997, which remained largely ineffective. In another bold step, the board had even invited the New Zealand Sports Turf Institute to study soil conditions in India and help relay the pitches at the leading venues. But, for some inexplicable reason, it failed to act upon the report prepared by the NZSTI. One has reasons to be sceptical about the new directive, as well as of the capabilities of the newly-formed pitches and grounds committee. 

 Similarly, the boards contention that cricket in India will improve by increasing the number of academies is flawed. The National Cricket Academy itself, in all its years of existence, has not been able to create a supply line of young players who can take the baton from the seniors. Rather than encouraging the mushrooming of academies, the board needs to take a hard look at the functioning of the NCA itself and try to find out why it has not been able to put in place a system that would produce quality players. However, the idea of replacing the zonal system of selection is certainly a noble one. But how does the board guarantee that the new selection committee will be free of partisan views and will put merit above regional considerations? The new committee will also be made up of men who have their strings tied to one zone or another.

 If the board were an individual, then it would be one who knows how to look after its interests. In the world that is growing more and more individualistic, the BCCI surely cannot be faulted for following the trend. It has built its own private club, run by politically-astute men on the single principle of making profit. Terms such as accountability are taboo inside the closed doors of its Mumbai headquarters, although the same term is expected to apply to everyone else. (Therefore, Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh must explain why they have an opinion in the first place.) The board seldom lets go of a chance to bully its employees into submission, but only after making sure that they, cornered by an unforgiving people, have nowhere else to turn to. 

 Jagmohan Dalmiya was once criticized for commenting that the players played for the board and much later for the country. The recent set of directives from the board reveals how true the former board chiefs comment was. But no, those Indians who attack Mohammed Kaifs house after the teams defeat will not vandalize the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai. The players too will keep mum and hope their contracts are renewed. But it is time someone stood up and asked why the worlds richest cricket board still does not have a website of its own.

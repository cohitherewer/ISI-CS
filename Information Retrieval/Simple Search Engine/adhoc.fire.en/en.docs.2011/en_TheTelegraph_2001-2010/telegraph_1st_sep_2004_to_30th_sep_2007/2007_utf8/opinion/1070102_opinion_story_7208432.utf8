The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ARMY IN SHAME 

 One of the cardinal principles of any democracy is the subordination of the army to civilian rule. The symbolic manifestation of this principle is the salute that the military gives to the president of India on Republic Day. It is this subordination of the entire military machine that distinguishes the Indian polity and the Indian army from the dictatorship in Pakistan. A group of soldiers led by a senior officer of the army violated this fundamental principle of democracy on New Years Eve in Calcutta. Two officers of the army in mufti were apprehended because they were misbehaving with women during festivities in a hotel on Park Street. After their arrest, soldiers appeared in full uniform and armed with sophisticated weapons at the Park Street police station and proceeded to ransack it and beat up policemen. They opened the lock-up cell to free the two officers who had been arrested. In short, armymen took the law into their own hands in a classic show of gamekeepers turning into poachers. The officers who misbehaved and those of their colleagues who perpetrated the violence have brought disgrace to the Indian army. Some of the guilty may have been officers, but they were certainly not gentlemen. The last day of 2006 has turned out to be a day of great shame for Indian democracy and for the Indian army.

 At an overall policy level, it is true that the Indian army has maintained its subordination to civilian rule. But at the level of the everyday, there have been many instances when members of the armed forces have behaved as if they are above the law, and in a manner that suggests that they see themselves to be beyond the norms of civilized behaviour. Sundays incident on Park Street is a grotesque example of this appalling trend. If such a gross violation can actually occur in the heart of Calcutta on a festival night, there is good cause to fear what the army can do when it is actually conducting operations in areas like Manipur or Jammu and Kashmir. The authorities, civilian and military, should take a stern view of such violations. Some armymen have disgraced their uniform. The least that can be done is to strip them of their uniforms and to court-martial them. The punishment meted out should be exemplary, with no attempt to cover up the seriousness of the offence. Soldiers and officers should be instructed about where they stand and how they should behave, whatever be the provocation. The Indian army is an army in a democracy, not in a tinpot dictatorship.

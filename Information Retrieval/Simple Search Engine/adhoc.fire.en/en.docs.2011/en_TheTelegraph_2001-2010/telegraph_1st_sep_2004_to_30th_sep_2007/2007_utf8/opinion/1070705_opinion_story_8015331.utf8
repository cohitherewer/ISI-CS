 A MIXED BAG OF RICHES

 S.L. Narasimhan

 FIFTH COLUMN 

 The Cultural Revolution under Mao Zedong proved to be disastrous for the economy of China. After Maos death, Deng Xiaoping opened up Chinas markets in 1978 in a bid to revive the economy. Since then, China s economic growth has attracted international attention and admiration.

 The economic progress advocated by the second and third generation leaders has been further emphasized by the present leaders. In order to keep the economy growing, the government has invested heavily in infrastructure and subsidized the process of floating tenders by Chinese companies for overseas investment. Foreign direct investment has also been instrumental in driving the economy. So far, approximately 660 billion US dollars have been invested in China, mostly in the manufacturing sector. Another major factor that has propelled growth is fixed assets investment. In 2005, the fixed assets investment accounted for 49 per cent of the economy and has been growing at the rate of 27 to 30 per cent every year.

 The foreign exchange reserve of China is approximately 1.3 trillion dollars, reportedly the highest in the world. It appears that the government is retaining such a large reserve to maintain the balance in the economy. The government also doles out incentives to entrepreneurs. It has also taken steps to keep the cost of labour low. The Chinese labour force is a disciplined lot and the work culture is something that needs to be seen to believe. 

 Highs and lows

 Many of these factors have contributed to the growth of the Chinese economy. But there are problem areas as well. For instance, the lack of infrastructure has created problems in the timely delivery of coal to thermal stations. That is not all. Since the economy is funded partially by the government, all government-owned banks have been lending money. This has resulted in four major government-owned banks accumulating non performing loans. The figure, as of now, is approximately 500 billion dollars and is growing. 

 The steady growth of the economy has resulted in its overheating. To curb this, the government has raised lending interest rates and imposed restrictions on lending by banks. Till a few years back, many state-owned enterprises had been languishing because of their inability to modernize themselves. The one-child policy adopted by the State has resulted in the rise of an ageing population, thereby reducing the availability of a young work force.

 Development in China has also been skewed. Eastern China is far better developed than western China. To overcome this disparity, the government has proposed a Go West policy, and sought to give incentives to entrepreneurs who are interested in setting up business in this region. But the policy has not been much of a success.

 China has been facing a shortage of electricity as well. Even though the Three Gorges Dam is expected to produce 28,800 MW of power by 2009, China will still face a shortage of electricity. Worse, the development of unconventional energy resources is at a nascent stage in China. 

 Moreover, a number of social problems have also cropped up due to uncontrolled economic growth. The official unemployment figure is 4.2 per cent, although an unofficial estimate has pegged the figure at nearly 10 per cent. This has led to the creation of social unrest and protests. While some of the protests were against corruption and land grabbing activities, others voiced concerns over issues such as environmental degradation and human rights abuse. 

 It is true that Chinese economy is growing at an impressive pace. But first, the obstacles that lie in its path need to be removed by the countrys financial planners for the creation of an equal and harmonious society.

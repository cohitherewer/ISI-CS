 Letters to Editor

 Still burning

 Sir Keeping an eye on their vote-banks, political parties in power at various times have given in to demands made on grounds of caste. So much so that caste has almost become the sole factor during elections today. Be it Karunanidhi in the South or Mayavati in the North, caste is the mainstay of most Indian politicians. The consequence of giving undue importance to caste is an incident like the recent violence involving the Gujjars of Rajasthan (Blood on quota politics, May 30). The clash between the Gujjars and the police has left civilians as well as policemen dead. The Gujjars want a transfer from the category of other backward classes to that of scheduled tribes, but the Bharatiya Janata Party government of Rajasthan has not met their demand yet. The United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre will surely hasten now to appease the Gujjars. But once that is done, other communities across the country will start clamouring immediately for reservations. And the more India gets divided along the lines of caste, the weaker will it get. 

 Yours faithfully,

Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai 

 Sir Opportunistic political parties are bound to exploit the situation in Rajasthan to their advantage. The police will be condemned for the shooting and martyrs will be made of the Gujjars who had started the fracas by stoning police vehicles. This can be avoided only if the Central Bureau of Investigation conducts an inquiry and finds out the truth. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir The agitation of the Gujjars is strange in a way because they are demanding a demotion of sorts. But they feel that they would benefit if they are reclassified as tribals. The Centres reservation policy is behind all this. The way the government displays its munificence towards various groups of people under the quota system, a day might come when disturbances like the one in Rajasthan will rock every part of India, as one community will think that the other is getting all the sops. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir The false promises of politicians and the stupidity of the police are more to blame for the loss of lives in Dausa than the quota system. The BJP government in the state has failed to keep its pledge to pressurize the Centre to shift the Gujjars from the OBC to the ST list. The Gujjars, who have witnessed a remarkable improvement in the lot of their rival communities the Jats and the Meenas felt cheated and so came out to protest. Since the Gujjars had been voicing their discontent for quite some time now, the state government should have been more alert. If more policemen had been sent when the demonstration began, the situation could have been tackled without the police having to open fire. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Barasat

 Sir Sachin Pilot, the member of parliament from Dausa, where the Gujjar-police clashes took place, is acting holier-than-thou by saying that the police firing is reminiscent of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. His party, the Congress, is neck-deep in quota politics too. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Mirza Hasanuzzaman, Calcutta

 Sir A fight akin to the one among the Gujjars, Meenas and Jats in Rajasthan is being fought between the two powerful SC groups the Malas and Madigas in Andhra Pradesh. The Malas have accused the Madigas of usurping their share of state government jobs. The chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan should sit down and try to find a solution to their similar problems.

 Yours faithfully,

K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore

 Sir Any show of protest that results in damage to life and property should be firmly dealt with. There is no question of the police dealing gently with the Gujjars, who set ablaze two police stations in Dubi and Sikandra in the Dausa district, besides pelting police vans with rocks. Instead of compensating the family of those killed in the ruckus, the value of the loss of property should be estimated and recovered from the protesters. Let this be a lesson to those who indulge in wanton destruction in the name of protest.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir It is unfortunate that even after 60 years of independence, communities are trying to ensure their well being by hanging on to the crutches of reservation. The whole policy of reservation needs to be reviewed before it breaks down the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.N. Mahanty, Puri

 Sir Quotas are the politicians tool, and help nobody but them. Already the Supreme Court has held that reservation at the cost of efficiency is not desirable and should not be permitted. Our politicians should stop exploiting the poor by dangling the card of reservation before them. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir It is obvious from the example of the Gujjars that all OBCs are not equally backward and therefore, do not get equal benefits from the quota policy. The solution is to categorize communities like the Gujjars as extremely backward classes, a sub-quota within the OBC quota. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sachin Kurmi, Ghaziabad

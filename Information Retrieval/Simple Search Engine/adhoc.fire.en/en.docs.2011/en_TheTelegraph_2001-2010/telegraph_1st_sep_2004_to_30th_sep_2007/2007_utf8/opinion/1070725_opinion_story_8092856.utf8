The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Suffering in silence

Silent burden

 Sir The recent incident in which eve-teasers beat up a student for protesting against their behaviour with a young girl inside a bus in Salt Lake came as a shock (Lady, please step out and speak up, July 18). This shows, once again, that our security system does not operate for purposes of providing protection to citizens. Worse, bystanders seldom come to the rescue of victims fearing retaliation from these anti-social elements.

 One could easily resort to technology to resolve societal problems such as public harassment of women. Most people carry cellular phones these days. The police should set up a helpline so that such incidents can be reported immediately. This will help them to reach the scene of crime swiftly, thereby increasing the chances of nabbing the miscreants. It is unfortunate that we project India as a world leader in the field of software and telecommunication but are unable to use the expertise effectively to protect our own people.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhabrata Guru, Calcutta

 Sir If someone is harassed or molested in public, and chooses to be a mute spectator or to simply suffer in silence, then that person will be spared the fate of Jagannath De. The fact that none came to Des rescue after he was attacked reflects the erosion of values and ethics in our society. Only recently Tina Mukherjee, a model, was molested in public without a voice of protest from onlookers. Perhaps the people of Calcutta need to learn their lessons from Siddhartha Bahadur Sreshtha. Sreshtha, a shanty-dweller, foiled an attempt by robbers to loot a house in Salt Lake in the wee hours. That the thieves he was chasing were armed did not deter the brave young man, who even sustained a bullet injury during the chase. Coming together as a multicultural society during the celebration of festivals becomes a futile exercise in unity if the citizens of the country refuse to help each other out in times of crisis. Only recently, a school girl was harassed by a bus conductor and a driver in the presence of other passengers. No one had come to her rescue at that point of time. However, if there is a road mishap, people often give vent to their anger by burning public transport or blocking roads. If this herd mentality could be channelized in the direction of protest in the face of injustice, incidents such as the one that took place in Salt Lake could be averted.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The Telegraph has done well to print Jagannath Des appeal on the front page. The young man has shown exemplary courage in confronting a gang of troublemakers all by himself. The inaction on the part of other passengers is reprehensible. There is a possibility that those who remained silent derived vicarious pleasure in seeing a girl being teased in front of their eyes. Such a regressive mindset seems to be widely prevalent these days. In this case, the female victims refusal to come forward to testify may be put down to fear. However, it is the girls duty to lodge a complaint with the police, if only for the sake of the man who had come to her rescue. Moreover, by coming forward, she could greatly help the police in identifying and tracking down the offenders. For the sake of her safety, the police should have a witness-protection programme or at least ensure anonymity while recording her testimony. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir It is unfortunate that the lady who faced harassment at the hands of her tormentors is keeping mum, despite Jagannath Des public appeal to her to speak up. Incidents such as this one indicate that women in Calcutta are not safe anymore. And the silence of the witnesses, who should have stepped forward to protect the victim, is equally disturbing. It is difficult to find many men like Jagannath De or Bapi Sen. And if women refuse to speak out in favour of these individuals, even bravehearts would think twice before coming to their aid during trouble. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mirza Hassanuzzaman, Calcutta

 Sir I am a college student and am usually dressed in a jeans and a kurti while I travel. One gets to hear about gender equality a lot these days. Yet, on the streets of Calcutta, I have often been subjected to lewd remarks and stared at by men. I sometimes wonder why women have to put up with this kind of behaviour. The other day, I was followed home by a man on a bicycle. He kept hooting and leering, trying to grab my attention in every possible way. The man left me scared and helpless, because recent incidents in the city have convinced me that nobody would come to my defence even if I were to raise an alarm. All I could do was look away and pretend to ignore his comments. 

 The law-keepers in Calcutta need to be asked a few questions. For instance, what are they doing to ensure the safety of women in the city? I hope that the police are not of the opinion that women need to be cooped up at home and should be prevented from coming out into the open in order to solve the problem of harassment. It is a pity that we cannot feel safe in our own city. Can there indeed be a sorrier state of affairs ?

 Yours faithfully,

Doel Bose, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PARTY COLLEGE

 There is perhaps nothing surprising about the Left Front governments refusal to grant autonomy to Presidency College. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) might forsake Karl Marx, but it will never surrender its control over education. Despite this overarching consideration, what is difficult to understand is why it needed a motley and meaningless committee of so-called educationists to recommend that West Bengals most famous college should not be granted autonomy. The issue of taking Presidency College out of the Calcutta University system was never an academic question, it is a political and an administrative matter. The academic issues syllabi, faculty and so on can only be deliberated upon after the government shows its political will to treat the college as a separate and an autonomous institution with no formal links with Calcutta University. The government has failed to show this political will, and has tried to cover its failure by making it appear as an academic decision recommended by educationists.

 The committee has completely missed the intellectual assumptions on which the demand for autonomous colleges is based. The system of affiliating colleges borrowed from the model of London University has proved to be non-viable in the case of Calcutta University. There are too many students and colleges, and this has made a mockery of the examination system and of the academic content of teaching. Hence, the demand to reduce the size of Calcutta University by giving some colleges, with the resources and facilities, the authority to operate autonomously and move to a deemed university status. Presidency College, given its history, was an obvious choice, but the matter is further complicated because it is a government college. The CPI(M) has operated the system of transfers, which affects all government colleges in West Bengal, to shower benefits on its cadre and supporters.

 The recommendations of the committee only perpetuate this prevailing situation. The college has not been given the power to recruit faculty, but the system of transfers has been stopped. This means that it will continue with its existing faculty, many of whom do not deserve to teach in Presidency College. In fact, the committee, by design or otherwise, has done exactly what the teachers front of the CPI(M) would expect it to do. This casts doubts on the credibility of the committee and of its ability to comprehend the needs and functioning of a modern university. It has sacrificed excellence at the altar of political expediency. In so doing, it may have saved Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee from an encounter with the powerful teachers lobby, but it has done education in West Bengal a great disservice.

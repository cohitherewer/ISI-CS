 RIPE FOR MISCHIEF

 How old is Cruella de Vil? She persists in the imagination as a scheming woman in the prime of her powers an image deliciously aided by the unforgettable Glenn Close in that role, almost a twin of the cartoon character in 101 Dalmatians. It seems a little odd to call Cruella old, and cite her as an example of the negative portrayal of aged characters in Walt Disney cartoons. But it is not Cruellas age that is the issue in the research conducted by academics in Brigham Young University, Utah. All the concern is about the adverse impression negative portrayals of elderly people have on the young. They might take for granted that old people are crazy or evil in real life too. Not that there is any particular agreement regarding what is old in the West. In Britain, another researcher shows that youth ends at forty-nine and old age begins at sixty-five. Middle age, presumably, is as dangerous as old age, and should be portrayed kindly. After all, the American researchers looked at 93 characters who appeared to be fifty-five or older in 34 Disney productions going back 70 years. All they found was a significant minority of older characters who were bad-tempered, or evil, or stupid, including the Wicked Queen in Snow White and Smee in Peter Pan, and this has them seriously worried.

 It is no use going back to the Grimm brothers and demanding explanations of them, or to James Barrie and the other childrens writers either. Perhaps they wrote at a time when society was not single-mindedly geared towards fighting the ageing process. So, in the moving toyshop of political correctnesses to one phase of which Enid Blyton had fallen prey negative portrayals of the aged are now suspect. It is a telling comment on the disrespect academics have for the intelligence of children, but that is neither here nor there. What is worrying is the slow elimination of fun from childrens lives and imaginations. Fun is a robust concept: it can take in its stride quite a gory battle between good and evil, and part of the fun comes from being told these tales by a grandmother or a grandfather. The more isolated adults become in their own worlds, the more fearful are they of their childrens perceptions. Fables and fairy-tales that have traditionally helped in conditioning children for the cruelties and harshnesses of adult life can no longer be accepted innocently. Even the ending of Red Riding Hood has to be changed to lessen the bloodshed.

 Ageist confusions seem less troubling in Indian society as far as fairy-tales are concerned. There are as many witches in Indian tales as in the Western ones, and no one is bothered. But in the classic division between the older queen and the younger queen, it is the older queen who is always the victim and the younger one selfish, envious and either empty-headed or plain vicious. Perhaps there is some other imbalance to be corrected here? All this would make more sense if the concern for childrens tender minds translated into greater care for the old when the children grew up. As long as the elderly are lonely and neglected, the rest is pure academic entertainment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 CHIEF SUSPECT

 Dictators, great or small, must treat the law as an ass. To them, the law is what they decide it to be. Judges and courts are free to function only within the limits set by the rulers themselves. Mr Iftikhar Chaudhary, chief justice of Pakistans supreme court, seems to have taken his job too seriously for Mr Pervez Musharrafs comfort. Worse still, he indirectly put the General in the dock by asking the government to explain how and why several hundred people had disappeared from police custody. Obviously, the official reason for Mr Chaudharys suspension does not refer to his stand on human rights issues. His trial by the supreme judicial council will probably end as a state-sponsored farce. This is not the first time that the judiciary in Pakistan has been shown its place by a military dictator. However, a hopeful sign is that lawyers and a large section of the press have refused to be intimidated by the government. The lawyers protests and the medias sharp criticism of the governments move suggest that they have nothing but contempt for the official charges of corruption and misuse of authority against Mr Chaudhary. 

 For Pakistans president, the suspension of the countrys chief justice could not have come at a worse time. It came almost simultaneously with his announcement that he would like to stay on as president for another five years. The two developments together would nail the lie about his democratic pretensions. His claim to ensuring a functional and sustainable democracy in Pakistan should now be seen for what it is worth. If anything, it should remind the people of Pakistan of the claim made by Ayub Khan, the countrys first military dictator, that he wanted to give it basic democracy. It is also a time when Mr Musharrafs other failures are worrying Washington. His commitment to the international war on terror is being increasingly questioned. The United States of America is not convinced that he has done enough to fight Pakistan-based Islamist jihadis. Even more worrying is the support that these groups continue to receive from the Inter-Services Intelligence. Despite a long stint in power, Mr Musharraf does not seem to have found a political constituency of his own. The dangerous vacuum that he presides over cannot do either him or Pakistan any good.

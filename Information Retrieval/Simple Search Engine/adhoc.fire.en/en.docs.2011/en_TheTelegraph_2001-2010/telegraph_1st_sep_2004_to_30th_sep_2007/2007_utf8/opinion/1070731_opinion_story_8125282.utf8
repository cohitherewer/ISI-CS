 DEATH OF THE INDIAN BAZAAR 

 Malvika Singh

 MALA FIDE

 Farmers markets were once the 

 norm in India. In the smaller towns and villages of the 

 country they still continue to be the weekly event that 

 causes people to congregate and catch up with each others 

 lives. The disconnected administration, headed by the babus 

 who are desperately fleeing from their cultural roots and 

 taking the nation down with them, is compelling the dismal 

 death of these haats.

 On the one hand, Dilli Haat, which 

 displays and sells the varied products that represent the 

 fine skills of the hand to an urban middle class and the 

 elite, is celebrated.On the other, the babu wants to ban 

 traditional eateries and mobile retail outlets, otherwise 

 known as hawking. The contradictions only prove the anarchic 

 mind of those who determine life and living in urban India. 

 Their attitude and schemes are unacceptable to the citizen.

 All over the world, farmers markets 

 are the places where expensive, fresh, organic produce 

 unadulterated and pure is sold. People travel miles to 

 get to these retail points. Temporary craft shops, where 

 artisans sell their crafted wares, spring up on pavements 

 in the metropolitan cities and capitals of the world on 

 weekends. Antiques too are sold at such places. Roadside 

 eating is becoming a rage and has been institutionalized 

 in south-east Asia. But, as usual, we in India are busy 

 destroying what comes to us naturally. It is quite appalling 

 to see how an upwardly mobile and thoughtless bureaucracy 

 is transforming India into a sub-standard clone of the West. 

 One wonders why the handful of men and women in government, 

 who understand the realities and their importance in cultural, 

 social and economic terms, do not lead a campaign against 

 the terrible initiatives being undertaken by dull and unimaginative 

 babus.

 Eyes wide shut

 The concept of Dilli Haat needs 

 to be put in place for every colony in Delhi. These markets 

 would be places where fresh vegetables, fruit, milk and 

 spices would be available. Other home products, along with 

 all the essential bits and pieces that we see being sold 

 at the delightful small-town and village haats, should be 

 included. Historic eateries that are landmarks of the city 

 must be consolidated and provided with necessary infrastructure 

 so that they can function within set norms of hygiene. Removing 

 them makes no sense at all. It merely smacks of the arrogance 

 of the administration that has, over the decades, failed 

 to keep the city clean. This is yet another avenue for making 

 a quick buck. It is yet another way of shoving failure under 

 the rug. The time has come to ensure a clean and honest 

 municipality, one that delivers the goods. The accumulated 

 filth, garbage and excreta that lie unattended for days 

 along the endless bylanes of the capital are sickening. 

 Alas, the leaders drive past with their eyes closed, oblivious 

 to the horror that their failure has bestowed upon us.

 The great Indian bazaar is far 

 more appealing than the uninteresting malls. The mayor of 

 London is organizing a bazaar on Regent Street and we are 

 sweeping away one of our extraordinary legacies. How foolish 

 can we get? We must infuse new life into the bazaar with 

 modern infrastructure. We must be proud of what is Indian, 

 of what the economically advanced countries of the world 

 are adopting with pomp-and-show. Old, crumbling structures 

 are being restored to house individual craft boutiques. 

 Small is beautiful is a maxim that the mass market of 

 the mall does not know. Why are we always lagging behind 

 the world, lagging well behind even Asia? Indian custom 

 thrives in Bali but is fast becoming non-existent in the 

 home country. Why are we so insecure about ourselves and 

 our indigenous style?

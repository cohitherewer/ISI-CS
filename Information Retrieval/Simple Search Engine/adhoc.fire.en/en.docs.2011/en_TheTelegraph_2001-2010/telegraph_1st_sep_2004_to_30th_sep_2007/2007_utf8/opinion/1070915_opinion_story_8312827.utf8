The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Monsoon magic

 Shortlisting about a hundred relevant songs from a total of 2,500 composed by Tagore is an arduous task by itself. Apala Basu the soul behind Bratee, a cultural organization has the insight and musical acumen to produce such a collection. Rabir Gaaney Badal Ragini (Madhusudan Mancha, Aug 20) was a fairly engaging demonstration of the use of monsoon ragas and moods in Tagores songs. The strange absence of a popular monsoon raga like Jayjayanti or the extensive use of Khamaj, Yaman, Kafi, Piloo and Bharavi, and the pure rain symphony in Mian ki malhar (Jhara jhara barishey), Desh (Esho shyamal sundar), Megh (Timirmoy nibir nisha), or Chhayanat (Godhuli gaganey meghey) speak of the appeal that the season held for the poet. Pramita Mallick, Swastika Mukhopadhyay, Debashis Roy Chowdhury and Aniruddha Sinha lent the required musical support to a thoughtfully-planned programme otherwise marred by lacklustre solo and choral rendition of the songs. The original raga demonstrations were a class apart from the rest, particularly the performance of Suranjana Basu.

 Limited appeal

 As every year, Odissi Dancers Forum presented a recital to pay homage to Kelucharan Mahapatra this year (Gyan Manch, Aug 12). Among the 13 dance numbers, very few bore the mark of high standard and dedication preached by the maestro. Rina Jana, an elegant and energetic dancer, stole the show with her pallavi. It was different from the sophisticated choreography done by Kelucharan Mahapatra and had a rustic flavour. Nandini Ghosal proved her understanding of the idiom in her abhinaya. Rajyasree Praharaj wove a beautiful tapestry of rhythmic pattern in her charukeshi pallavi. Eman pallavi choreographed by Rajiv Bhattacharya and performed by Rukmini, Trisha and Sayantani was carefully executed, but could not achieve perfection. Poushali Mukherjee tried an experimental piece with a Baul anger gan but could not make an impact. Kakoli Bose was pleasing but Maya Bhattacharyas Saswata Prem was melodramatic. Aloka Kanoongos choreography was a delight to watch. Ranga Shruti, choreographed by Manjusree Banerjee was an average presentation.

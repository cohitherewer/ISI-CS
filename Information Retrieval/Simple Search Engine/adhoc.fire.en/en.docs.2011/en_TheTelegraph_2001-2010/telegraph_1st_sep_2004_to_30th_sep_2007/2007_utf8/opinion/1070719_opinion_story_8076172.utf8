 SPARE THE ROD

 Eve-teasing is a convenient coinage. It trivializes the humiliation, harassment and even molestation inflicted upon women in public teasing is a shameless cover-up for a vicious male practice. But the term has become a convenience in other ways too. It is used to distract attention from gang violence, sometimes resulting in murder, directed towards other men: the rare men of courage and decency who cannot turn away when hoodlums insult, disturb and hurt women around them. Jagannath De and Subhendu Roy objected to a woman being harassed in the bus they were on while the other passengers remained passive. They were forced off the bus by the conductor and were beaten up, especially Mr De, to an inch of their lives by the thugs who were insulting the woman. Yet the police seem helpless without witnesses, unable to locate even the driver and the conductor of the bus, and instead have concentrated their strenuous attentions on the two who tried to do what was right.

 Looking back at the series of recent episodes of a similar kind, it is the picture of gang violence that is most striking. The gangs are armed and ready to kill. In 2002, a young man was shot dead in a packed private bus for protesting against the harassment of a woman by six men, a hawker was slashed with a knife when he objected to two young men harassing women at a suburban railway station. In 2004, a man was killed when he tried to stop a group from harassing women near a pond. In 2005, a policeman was injured when he went to investigate a complaint of group harassment. The incidents are a random selection. The Bapi Sen murder, of course, remains the archetype of this crime, but the nature of the assaults raises very important issues. The smooth assimilation of criminal violence and gang culture into political life has bred a society in which protest against a majority, often an armed majority, is ruthlessly crushed. The ability to stand up for decency has been banished by fear, because the perpetrators are seldom caught and almost never punished. The focus, this being eve-teasing, is therefore conveniently turned on the targeted woman. It is as if the injury or death of the protestor is not enough, as if all other witnesses are excused from speaking. It is the rescued womans cowardly silence that is to blame if the criminals are not caught. In how many more ways can the buck be passed?

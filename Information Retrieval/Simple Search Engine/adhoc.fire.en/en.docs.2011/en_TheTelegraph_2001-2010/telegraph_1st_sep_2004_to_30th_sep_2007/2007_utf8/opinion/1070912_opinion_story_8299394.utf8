 The dreaded finger

 Sir The dubious dismissal of Sachin Tendulkar in the series decider against England at Lords was downright shocking (Worst Dar comes true, Sept 9). To avoid such hurried and careless decisions in future, and to ensure a fair result, serious action should be taken against umpires like Aleem Dar. The Indian team should lodge a complaint with the International Cricket Council against Dar. It is shocking to see experienced umpires like Dar getting away with so many imprudent decisions in a single series.

 Yours faithfully,

Vijay Agarwal,

 Sir Why is it that Rahul Dravid is singled out for criticism everytime India loses a match? Once again the blame for the defeat at Lords is being put on Dravid for his decision to go in with seven batsmen and four bowlers despite the fact that the Indians were done in by poor umpiring. Aleem Dar, one of the match umpires, ruled Sachin Tendulkar out, although television footage showed that the batsman had not nicked the ball. What was also surprising to see was the media raising a din about Tendulkars unfortunate dismissal in his last match in England. Had the press forgotten that the match, in all probability, was the last time Sourav Ganguly and Dravid played on English soil as well?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Indias loss against England at Lords did not come as a surprise. The team needs to change its attitude and approach towards the game. Although the incorrect decision made by the umpire, Aleem Dar, undoubtedly affected Indias chances, it must be conceded that our batting performance was not up to the mark. Time and again, India has shown that its batting line-up succumbs to pressure in crucial ties. Moreover, Indian players often lack the willpower and the killer instinct that are required to win matches. Indian cricketers make millions through endorsements. They have also been given the status of demigods by their countrymen. However, given their recent performance, it is worth questioning whether Indian cricketers are worthy of their iconic status. The Board of Control for Cricket in India must look into the disappointing performance of our players before they manage to convince the fans that they lost because of Dars umpiring.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir This is not the first time that India has suffered as a result of poor umpiring. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the quality of umpiring has not been up to the mark throughout the tour of England. It is true that, in cricket, umpires cannot take recourse to action replays on the field. But this does not mean that an umpire can make mistakes repeatedly, thereby turning a match into a farce. There is an urgent need for the ICC to review controversial umpiring decisions. The worlds apex cricket body can then take appropriate action to ensure that only people who are competent are allowed to umpire international matches.

 Yours faithfully,

 Common tune

 Sir One is aghast at the way television channels airing reality shows and music competitions goad the audience to vote for their favourite contestants through text messages and phone calls in order to earn crores of rupees (Hill idol at final frontier, Sept 10).

 Sony Televisions Indian Idol, the desi version of American Idol, is drawing a large number of viewers from all over the country. Given its popularity, this is perfectly understandable. But the system of pushing a singer to the top by means of phone calls and SMSs raises questions about the merit of the participants. It seems that the contestants are expected to win on the basis of their popularity rather than their musical talent. It is ironic that the judges of the competition, who are expected to have the requisite expertise to recognize talent, play no part in deciding the winner.

 People should learn to exercise their common sense while casting their votes. Unfortunately, going by the trend of the winners of many of these competitions, it is evident that the viewers are doing exactly the opposite while choosing the winners of these competitions. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir There are several talent-hunt programmes that are being aired across television channels these days. Many of them are fairly successful, and are attracting viewers both from within and outside the country. 

 It is a pleasant surprise to find that quite a few of the participants in these shows hail from neigbouring countries such as Pakistan and Nepal. The fact that the audience, participants and producers in India have so heartily welcomed contestants from Pakistan, ignoring the strained ties between the two countries, just goes to show that these programmes do in fact contribute to spreading peace and harmony across the border. This goes on to show, once again, that the people of India and Pakistan share a common love of the arts and will not allow political conflicts to spoil shared passions. One only hopes that television channels in India will continue to host many more such shows which help foster stronger bonds of friendship between the citizens of our country and Pakistan.

 Yours faithfully,

Srikanta Bhattacharjee,

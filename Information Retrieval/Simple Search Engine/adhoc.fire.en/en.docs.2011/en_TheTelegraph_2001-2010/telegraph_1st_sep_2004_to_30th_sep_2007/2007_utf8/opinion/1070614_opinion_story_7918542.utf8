The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 REVERSE GEAR

 Two steps back, one step forward. This is how the Board of Control for Cricket in India believes in making progress. Legend has it that the man who laid the tracks for the toy train that goes up the hills to Darjeeling worked on the same principle. Nobody in his right mind recommends the toy train for speed and efficiency. It is a quaint little antique. The BCCI is gradually reducing itself to a similar position. It runs the danger of being perceived as a useless body that refuses to escape from Jurassic Park. The appointment of Chandu Borde as the manager of the Indian cricket team scheduled to tour England, Scotland and Ireland between June and September is a sure sign that the BCCI is looking backwards. Mr Bordes last assignment as a manager of the national team was in 1989; his stint as chairman of the selection committee ended in 2002; and he is of an age when he should be watching cricket in the comfort of his drawing room rather than advising players, old enough to be his son, on matters of technique, strategy and fitness. Mr Borde has no direct exposure to the demands of modern cricket since he retired from test cricket in 1969 long before one-day cricket and the changes that it has entailed in attitude were twinkles in even Kerry Packers eye. What contribution Mr Borde can now make to the Indian team remains something of a mystery, whose solution is known to those who control the BCCI, or maybe not even to them. His name, for all one knows, could have been pulled out of a hat. Mr Borde has said that the news of his appointment came to him like a bolt from the blue. He was unknowingly speaking for all followers of the game of cricket in India.

 Yet, in these columns, The Telegraph wrote strongly about the lack of professionalism in the BCCI. The appointment of Mr Borde only proves the point. It is clear that no one at the helm of affairs in the BCCI is thinking of the future. There is no clarity regarding planning and priority: ad- hocism prevails. It is obvious, of course, that Mr Bordes appointment is a stopgap arrangement, but that does not answer the question: why Mr Borde? It is tempting to draw the conclusion that the BCCI, despite its name, is not concerned about cricket in India. If Sharad Pawar and his advisors want to dispel this notion, they should go about the business of selecting a coach and not a manager with a little more competence and good sense.

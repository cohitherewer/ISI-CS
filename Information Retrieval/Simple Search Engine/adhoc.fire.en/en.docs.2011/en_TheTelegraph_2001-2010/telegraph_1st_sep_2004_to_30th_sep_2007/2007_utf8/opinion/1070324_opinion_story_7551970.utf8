 Beauty among the beasts

 Sir The Darjeeling municipalitys way of teaching the owners of Fortune Resort Central hotel a lesson for failing to pay its tax arrears was filthy and crude (Dirty trick on 102-year-old defaulter, Mar 21). Dinesh Gurung, the commissioner in charge of conservancy, outstepped the limits of decency when he ordered workers to unload garbage at the doorstep of the heritage hotel. Darjeeling is already having difficulties in dealing with its waste. The municipality should try to restore the beauty of the hill station instead of hastening its decline. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Mind the gap

 Sir A prejudiced knowledge of history is a dangerous thing, particularly when it is flaunted as the true picture by an upcoming politician like Rahul Gandhi (Rahul connects in heartland drive, Mar 21). Rahul Gandhi may be trying to ingratiate himself with his potential voters in Uttar Pradesh, but that hardly justifies his attempt to colour the Babri Masjid episode in a way that suits him. His assertion that the demolition of the Babri Masjid would not have taken place had a member of the Gandhi family been in power at the time of its razing, is outrageous in its deliberate blindness to the facts of history. 

 The late Rajiv Gandhi had played an active part in the build-up to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. He had lent his support to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad-led ceremony of shilanyas for the Ram temple and had allowed Hindus to perform a puja at a supposedly undisputed site near the Babri Masjid. When one is aware of this history, it is difficult for him to believe Rahul Gandhi saying that Rajiv Gandhi would have sacrificed his life to protect the mosque. However, now that the Gandhis are back in power (albeit indirectly), they might as well try to prove their loyalty to the cause of the Babri Masjid by trying to rebuild it. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshobhya, Mysore

 Sir Rahul Gandhi has adopted a holier-than-thou stance over the Babri Masjid demolition. It is easy to transfer the responsibility of the demolition to the late prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, now that, after 15 long years, people are on the verge of forgetting what really happened in the turbulent days before and after the episode. But those who remember will know that Rajiv Gandhi was not as innocent of the destruction as his son makes him out to be. Rahul Gandhi may be trying to lure back the Muslim voters of UP by distancing his family from what happened in Ayodhya in 1992. But in the process, he is also indulging in petty mud-slinging, which is unexpected of him. As a representative of the young brigade of Indian politics, Rahul Gandhi should try to do better than play the stale card of factionalism, which has been used to its death by Indian politicians over the years. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir Rahul Gandhis comment might prove dear to the Congress in the times to come since many senior cabinet members of the present Union government were a part of P.V. Narasimha Raos ministry when the demolition of Babri Masjid took place.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir When Rajiv Gandhi wanted the vote of the Hindus, he adopted a soft-Hindutva position on the Babri Masjid issue. And now that his son wants to enlist the support of the Muslims, he claims that Rajiv Gandhi was all sympathy for the rights of the Muslims over Babri Masjid. One despairs of the fate of India, which continues to be ruled down the generations by politicians who are never able to think beyond their selfish concerns.

 Yours faithfully,

Soma Datta, Siliguri

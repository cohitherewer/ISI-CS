The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FINE CURE

 Whether it is a lingering death by poisoned air or a swift death brought about by a drunk driver, the streets of Calcutta offer a variety of fatalities. Screaming buses race one another as motorbike riders without helmets shoot past on the left, taxis compete in squeezing into spaces meant for Dinky toys, auto-rickshaws decide on sudden right-angle turns without a squeak of warning, youngsters in candy-coloured cars whiz by drunk on alcohol and hard rock, pedestrians gleefully run obstacle races across the road three-and-a-half steps away from the zebra crossing and all this amid a fug of poisonous gases that would have put hells cauldron to shame. None of this happened in a day: it has taken many years and reams of laws ineffectually applied to produce this daily route to death. There is now a new bill at the Centre, which, if passed, would be far harsher than before on offenders on the road. But experience shows that, harsh or mild, no law is making a difference. The problem, then, must lie elsewhere.

 A law must be seen to be enforced. The penalty is exemplary, discouraging others to offend in the same way. The Indian justice system requires that every offence go to court where guilt is proven before the verdict. All of which takes time. While this is right and just for everything else, a departure is needed in the case of traffic law. Spot fines alone will act as deterrent. There are already spot fines for riding a two-wheeler without a helmet, or for talking on a cellphone while at the wheel. The new law would allow policemen to suspend a drivers licence if tests show he is drunk. Fines on the spot for speeding, for tailpipe emission, for driving without papers, for stopping without warning or in the middle of the road, for repeatedly changing lanes or barging into the right-of-way stream, for ignoring traffic signs and lights, would be true deterrents. Pedestrians, too, would be fined for violating safety rules. And to make this work, teams of policemen should be given incentives. Teams, not individuals so that payments other than fines are less easily collected.

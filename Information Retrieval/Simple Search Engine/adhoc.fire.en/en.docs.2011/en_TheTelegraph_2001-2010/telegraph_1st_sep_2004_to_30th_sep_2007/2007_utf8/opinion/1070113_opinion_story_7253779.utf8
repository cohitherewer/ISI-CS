 CONSTITUTION SUPREME

 A balancing act is never easy. But the Indian judiciary, having the job imposed on it by a prodigious turn of events in Indias democratic history, seems to have achieved an admirable feat. Only a day ago, the Supreme Court reminded a quibbling legislature that its actions are not beyond judicial scrutiny. The court has once again sought to make the body conscious of the latters subordination to constitutional provisions by ruling that acts passed by it, even on subjects included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, are not exempt from the purview of the judiciary. The apex court allows for judicial review of all legislation that violates the basic structure of the Constitution and the fundamental rights that are part of it. By saying so, it takes away from the legislature the last bastion of immunity and gives to the people of the country a chance to challenge any law that is seen to go against the supreme rights of equality, freedom of expression and life that the Constitution bestows on them. 

 The importance of this verdict in reaffirming the fine balance on which democracy works in this country cannot be underestimated. There can be little doubts that the Ninth Schedule which had been drawn up in 1951, by the Congress government to push through its land reform without objections from a conservative judiciary has been flagrantly abused by the legislature. Over the years, the immunity granted by the provision has been used to pass unhindered any legislation meant to cater to specific vote-banks at the cost of the interests of other sections of the population. The result has been a pile-up of over 280 suspect acts in what is now infamously referred to as the laundry-bag of legislation. The recent attempts to invoke the Ninth Schedule against the apex courts much-disliked activism in the sealing drive in the capital, and to ward off judicial intervention in giving free rein to quota politics show the malicious intent of the legislature. As before, the parliament has been found trying to undermine a system of checks and balances that has been put in place by the Constitution itself.

 It goes without saying that the judgment will open a can of worms. Although it rules that laws passed before 1973 are immune, and that actions already taken by successive governments on the basis of the schedule will not be invalidated, the verdict opens up a vista of litigation by an empowered public. For the Central and state governments, the threats are more immediate. Tamil Nadu, for instance, runs the risk of having its legislation qualifying 69 per cent reservation in the state struck down, and the United Progressive Alliance may finally have to curb its enthusiasm regarding the extension of reservations. The coming days will not only find the will of the parliament, but also its wisdom, severely tested.

 SHADOWS AT THE TUNNELS END 

 MALA FIDE

 Malvika Singh

 Not a day passes without some 

 controversy or the other and usually it has to do with grossly 

 incorrect decision-making. One possible horror that is on 

 the brink of taking shape is the construction of a tunnel, 

 if you can call it that, to link the Commonwealth Games 

 village with the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium. And this, only 

 to reduce mere six minutes of travel time! It is rumoured 

 that this tunnel will bring forth the money for the present 

 ruling party to fight their next election. The Commonwealth 

 Games committee has not asked for this at all. It has merely 

 requested that one lane be kept free during the games, for 

 the participants to travel without having to deal with traffic 

 snarls in a city that just does not adhere to any traffic 

 rules at the best of times. If our leaders can close down 

 roads for their personal travel across the capital, the 

 roads might as well be blocked for two weeks to allow the 

 athletes smooth transit. 

 We can cope with that in the way we do each year during 

 the Republic Day parade rehear- sals that disrupt the travel 

 schedules of professionals in Delhi. This will be far better 

 than the destruction of this ancient and historic city. 

 Thousands of trees will be chopped, much to the delight 

 of the timber mafia, archaeological foundations will be 

 damaged, the historic layers of this remarkable city will 

 be scarred and pockmarked all for some silly games, both 

 political and sporting. Socialites, posing as environmentalists 

 and historians, architects and designers, are spouting all 

 sorts of unsubstantiated arguments in Delhi drawing rooms, 

 in defence of this new road. To compare New Delhi with New 

 York and with the renovation done in that modern, new city 

 is absurd, to say the least. Let us pray that this destructive 

 political pressure is overwhelmed by the call of serious 

 conservationists who are keeping the grand legacy of India 

 intact for our children. May intellectual sanity defeat 

 personal, political, short term agendas. 

 Towards anarchy

 Building mafias are having a field 

 day in Delhi. The green lung, the Delhi Ridge, is being 

 brutalized. Bribery and corruption are running amok as land 

 that legitimately belongs to individuals is being redefined 

 to allow its takeover by urban land-grabbers who pay unimaginable 

 amounts for such conversions. High density condominiums 

 are being described as the new shangri-las for the 

 new rich, who will, in their innocence, put their hard-earned 

 money into these urban slums that will soon be without water 

 and other basic needs. When Imperial Delhi was conceived, 

 Lord Hardinge rejected the idea of making the capital encroach 

 on the area of the Ridge because he believed that a fight 

 with nature would never be won and that nature was supreme. 

 Why is the thinking of our home-grown imperialists so warped 

 and selfish and so unlike Hardinges? 

 Unfortunately, every repository 

 of our rich tradition, our diverse culture, is under threat 

 today because we are ruled by greedy, unscrupulous men. 

 Selfish leaders charged with the desperation to remain in 

 power at all costs, and illiterate and inexperienced babus 

 have forged a nexus that is pushing India towards anarchy. 

 Pollution is not just in the air, but in the minds of those 

 who rule. To fight this rapid corrosion will be a Herculean 

 task, one fraught with difficulty. Money and muscle overwhelm 

 us today and everything is up for grabs. Morality, and every 

 definition of the word, has been thrown to the winds. That 

 is where the renewal has to begin. The restoration of the 

 ethics of life and living has to be our priority. Without 

 it, the rising rate of growth will only aid the destruction 

 of the hitherto special fibre of our society.

 The quick-buck syndrome must make 

 way for creative thinking and honest endeavour.

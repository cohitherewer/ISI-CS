 GOING STRONG

 The March figures of the index of industrial production show remarkable growth. The monthly index shows 12.9 per cent growth year-on-year. March is the closing month of the financial year; the year 2006-07 shows 11.3 per cent growth over 2005-06. The comparable figures for manufacturing are 9 per cent and 12.3 per cent. Growth has been accelerating; and the acceleration shows no signs of an end. If there is any sign of the boom peaking, the index of industrial production does not show it. After the dip in October, growth has been over 10 per cent in every month. If it hovered around 8 per cent in 2005, it was closer to 10 per cent in 2006; if the figures till now are to be trusted, the average in 2007 may be close to 12 per cent a year. This must be gratifying for the finance minister, who is known to be a bit of a growth junkie. It also gives a point to his controversy with the governor of the Reserve Bank of India some months ago. The governor had a sternly avuncular attitude towards the bubbly economy and imposed some punishing restrictions on bank lending to galloping industry. P. Chidambaram had hinted that growth was a good thing, and implied that a bit of inflation was a small price to pay for growth. He soon piped down, having presumably been admonished by higher powers, and Y. Venugopal Reddy had his way.

 It is doubtful if he will do it, but Mr Chidambaram could thumb his nose and say, I told you so. Inflation went up a bit from 5 per cent to 6 per cent but industrial growth went up from 8 per cent to 12 per cent. The governor of the RBI may disapprove because it is his job to crinkle his nose and admonish. He takes his duty as the principal inflation-basher seriously, and does not let himself be led astray by such frivolous figures like industrial production. But, Mr Chidambaram may well ask, which is good for the country? Four per cent inflation with 8 per cent industrial growth, or 6 per cent inflation with 12 per cent growth? 

 And, he could say that the people of the country are with him. At any rate, they are not against him. No one is demonstrating about the price rise, not even professional demonstrators such as the communists. There are demonstrations galore; but they are about quite different things in Nandigram against land acquisition, in Madurai against the patriarchs elder son, in Lucknow to welcome Uttar Pradeshs most acquisitive daughter back. But prices are on no ones mind; so it is possible to go broke for growth. He is generally at a disadvantage when he argues with the prime minister and the governor, who took degrees in economics. But if he ever feels like having an argument with them, this is a good time to have it.

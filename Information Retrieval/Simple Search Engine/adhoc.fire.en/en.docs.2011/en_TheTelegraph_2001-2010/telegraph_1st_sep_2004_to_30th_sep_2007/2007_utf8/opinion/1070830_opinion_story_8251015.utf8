The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DECLINE OF A CITY 

 - Existence determines consciousness in Calcutta 

 SURENDRA MUNSHI

 A city may decline in different 

 ways. Dilapidated buildings and roads in bad repair provide 

 visible signs of this decline. Heaps of uncollected garbage 

 and inadequate amenities such as transport do not show a 

 city in a good light. Since the economic condition of a 

 city indicates the viability of the city, deteriorating 

 economy is no sign of a thriving city. A city may decline 

 in terms of educational and health services as well. Institutions 

 created to take care of them may be weakened by external 

 or internal reasons. Falling professional standards may 

 be yet another way in which a city declines. Intellectual 

 and artistic cultivation may also show diminishing vitality.

 Calcutta has declined in many 

 ways. Once famous for its palaces, this city shows today 

 crumbling buildings and roads, which lend themselves to 

 the measurement of the depth of their potholes. A nature-lover 

 on a short visit to Calcutta once told me excitedly that 

 he had never seen anywhere so many saplings growing in the 

 walls of the buildings of a city. The battered buses of 

 Calcutta can be a good advertisement for the demerits of 

 a transport system gone wild. The garbage in Calcutta piles 

 up at all places. When it is transported away, it tends 

 to be done in such a reckless manner that one wonders whether 

 the purpose is to dispose of the garbage or to spread it 

 all over the city.

 Amartya Sen has talked recently 

 of the de-industrialization of Calcutta and how, in recent 

 times, there has been further decline due to misguided policies. 

 It is quite visible, even to common persons, how industries 

 set up under the British, such as jute, engineering and 

 tea, which were located in or around Calcutta, have gone 

 into decline. In other spheres as well, Calcutta has lost 

 ground. It is sad to see students from Calcutta having to 

 go out of their city in pursuit of higher education. Hospitals 

 in south India are full of patients from Calcutta and other 

 parts of West Bengal. This is happening to a city that was 

 once in the forefront of education, including medical education 

 and healthcare. As in reality, so in the world of images. 

 While Calcutta was, at one time, the leading centre of film 

 industry in India where Kundan Lal Saigal, the first superstar 

 of the film world, came from outside and made his name, 

 it is reduced today to making poor imitations of Bombay 

 films. The Bengali film industry has still not recovered 

 from the absence of Uttam Kumar, who died in 1980.

 It is common among some circles 

 in Calcutta to deny the importance of the physical decay 

 of the city. The claim of Calcutta as the cultural capital 

 of India is put up with chauvinistic zeal. It seems to be 

 assumed that the physical condition of the city is inversely 

 related to its cultural activity. It is as if Calcutta had 

 a splendid cultural life because of its physical squalor. 

 I do not buy this argument. As a person who has lived in 

 Calcutta all these years, I have witnessed here a convincing 

 demonstration of the elementary principle of Marx: existence 

 determines consciousness.

 The shrinking job market, the 

 helplessness of the youth, the indiscipline of those already 

 employed, the political patronage given to the worst elements 

 in society, the pervasive sense of nothing significant happening 

 this debris of the dark years under Jyoti Basu with which 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is struggling hard has left its 

 mark in less visible ways as well. This point was driven 

 home to me once when I went to pay my telephone bill. On 

 my failure to render the exact amount, the man at the counter 

 started shouting at me. How do you expect me to have the 

 change so early in the day? this seemed to be the theme 

 of his outburst. When I pointed out that this was no reason 

 to shout at me, he became even more aggressive. Shouting? 

 Am I shouting? he shouted back. It took me some time to 

 understand that he did not realize that he was being rude 

 to me. What was rude behaviour to me was routine behaviour 

 to him.

 It is this rudeness made routine 

 that has become prevalent in social life. The decline of 

 civility has taken place in a city which did pride itself 

 at one time for its bhadra civil behaviour. This 

 civil behaviour was seen negatively through Marxist eyes, 

 as if the way to de-class oneself was through making oneself 

 lumpen, as if the only quality that the workers of the world 

 had were of the lumpen kind. This transformation has taken 

 place across classes. It is not uncommon to see the educated 

 middle classes show the worst form of lumpen behaviour, 

 of which shouting at each other is the least of offences.

 A menacing expression of the decline 

 of civility is the manner in which women are being treated 

 on Calcuttas streets. What is being called eve teasing 

 is a misnomer for sexual harassment or molestation of women 

 by men. Such cases are being reported frequently. Considering 

 that only a small number of incidents get reported anyway, 

 there is an urgent need to engage with this disturbing problem.

 The manner in which those who 

 protest against the molestation of women get beaten up or 

 even killed, as in the case of Bapi Sen, shows how brazen 

 the miscreants have become in the city. The more disturbing 

 part of the problem was shown by a friends private narration, 

 which did not get reported in the papers. He was travelling 

 once in a city bus occupying a front seat. He suddenly heard 

 some noise coming from one of the back seats. When he looked 

 back, he found a man harassing a woman. Against her pleas 

 not to touch her body, the man was saying that it was just 

 her imagination. When my friend could not tolerate this 

 harassment any longer, he went to the man and asked him 

 not to stand next to her seat. It was not necessary, he 

 argued, as the bus was far from full. This led to further 

 altercation. Some of the friends of this man joined him 

 and started shouting and pushing my friend, threatening 

 to beat him up. This went on for some time. It was when 

 the miscreants got down from the bus on reaching their destination 

 that there was silence in the bus.

 This silence was broken by an 

 old man who chose to pass a judgment on what had just happened. 

 He said it loudly enough for everyone to hear. Women who 

 get badly treated in public places have themselves to blame. 

 They have become shameless, he said. That there was nothing 

 shameless about the woman who was being harassed had no 

 impact on his judgement, which was received with silence. 

 An old woman broke this silence. Praising my friend for 

 his effort, she chose strong language to chastize the other 

 men in the bus for not speaking out in defence of the woman. 

 For the man passing his judgment, she had nothing but contempt. 

 The masculinity of men here gets expressed in either harassing 

 women or watching impotently as other men harass them, 

 she said. This was her judgement on the incident.

 I tend to agree with her. Men 

 need to take note of her harsh judgement and also to ask 

 themselves where they go wrong when they blame the victims 

 of harassment. Women have a responsibility as well. They 

 have to fight their battle with courage and determination, 

 and fight together. They too have to ask themselves where 

 they go wrong.

 In a broader sense, the problem 

 belongs neither to men nor to women separately, but to our 

 collective social life. Civility has gone away from it. 

 I have referred to Marx earlier. Let me close by referring 

 to Manu, the original chauvinist of Hindu society, who cannot 

 exactly be blamed for being partial to women. In Manusmriti 

 (III: 56), he said, Where women are honoured, there 

 the gods are pleased; but where they are not honoured, no 

 sacred rite yields rewards.

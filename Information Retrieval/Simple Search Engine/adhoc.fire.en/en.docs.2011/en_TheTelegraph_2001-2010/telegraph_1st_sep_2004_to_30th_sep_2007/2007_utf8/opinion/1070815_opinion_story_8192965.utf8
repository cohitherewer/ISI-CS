 CHANGING TIMES

 Had it not been for the Generals sudden change of heart only days ago, Pakistan would have celebrated the 60th anniversary of its independence under very different circumstances. The country has witnessed similar circumstances at least six times before. Each time, the peoples democratic will has been subverted by the unilateral decision of its rulers to clamp down emergency, and thereby to place their own interests above those of the nation. Quizzically, an identical logic of self-preservation seems to have motivated Pervez Musharraf to reconsider following the same trajectory. Moments away from declaring an emergency, Mr Musharraf seems to have suddenly found the cons of such a move weighing heavier than the pros. The national high alert would have seen his term being unconditionally extended to the end of next year, given him the power to cow down the belligerent Islamist radicals and taliban, muzzled the press and sealed the borders against the entry of his exiled political rivals. But Mr Musharraf seems to have sold himself to the dream of acquiring a democratic gloss. He has reiterated his promise of holding free and fair elections, preferably in the absence of expelled former heads of State, and seems willing to tolerate all internal and external threats to his presidency till then. Unless, of course, as his prime minister has warned, his hand is forced.

 There might be questions about Mr Musharrafs compulsions in appearing to be so accommodating. An answer may be found in Pakistans powerful pro-democracy movement, which has so miserably exposed Mr Musharrafs double standards, robbed much of his authority as the constitutional head and empowered the judiciary in an unprecedented manner. Mr Musharraf could not afford to risk further unpopularity among the forces, which will, to a large extent, determine his political destiny. The judiciary is not only supposed to determine the legalities of his next term, but could have also overruled the imposition of an emergency. Perhaps it is also possible to identify the American sleight of hand in the sharp change of the presidents mood. Be as it may, it will be infinitely easier for Mr Musharraf to sell himself as a ruler responsive to the changing realities of his country than one who is fossilized in time.

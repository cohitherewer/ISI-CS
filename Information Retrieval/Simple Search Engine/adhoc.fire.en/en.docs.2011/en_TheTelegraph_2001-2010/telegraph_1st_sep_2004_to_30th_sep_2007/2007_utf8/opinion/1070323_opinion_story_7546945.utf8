 Paperback Pickings

 Walk down turbulent times

 Kashmir Pending (Phantomville, Rs 300) by Naseer Ahmed and Saurabh Singh may not give much reason to think that the graphic novel has come of age in India, but that is mainly because most of them fail to enact a harmony between the artwork and the narrative (even when both are created by the same person). In this novel, for instance, Saurabh Singh rsquo;s skill as an artist far surpasses Naseer Ahmed rsquo;s talent as a storyteller. The story, given that it comes from the Valley of Turbulence, has even less drama than can be gleaned from the sentimental magazine features on ldquo;terrorists/ freedom fighters rdquo;. It is the familiar story of a lost idyll, told by a Kashmiri man in jail who moves from revolutionary zeal to disenchantment. And of course, he falls for lines such as ldquo;Something that has been taken by force can only be reclaimed by force. rdquo; Hopefully, Singh will get a better story to work on next time.

 Stolen Voices (Arvind Kumar, Rs 250) edited by Zlata Filipovic and Melanie Challenger brings some of the journals maintained by teenagers during times of war. Filipovic, one of the editors, herself shot to fame during the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina because of the diary she kept during the chaotic period. It is good that she has felt motivated to collect more such accounts, right from World War I down to the Iraq. Twelve-year-old Piete Kuhr knows in 1915 that ldquo;when I am fifty or sixty, what I have written as a child will seem strange rdquo;, and Inge Pollak, also 12, in 1939, hopes that some day, ldquo;I will read these pages and will say: lsquo;I am too happy to remember how that felt. rsquo; rdquo; Nine of the fourteen diarists are girls, and many of them quote poems they love.

 Ten Heritage Walks of Mumbai (Rupa, Rs 395) by Fiona Fernandez takes the reader around those parts of the city which, if they could speak, would not answer to the name Mumbai. Down the Fort area, Flora Fountain, Azad Maidan and the church-infested Bandra localities (Mount Mary rsquo;s church in the picture), the walks could be compared with those through Jack the Ripper rsquo;s or Shakespeare rsquo;s London. The little lsquo;did-you-know rsquo; boxes are as informative as they are delightful. One of them informs that today rsquo;s Rampart Row (in the south-western half of Fort) ldquo;was once the heart of the rope-making industry rdquo;, and hence known as Ropewalk Lane.

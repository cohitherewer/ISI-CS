 LOOKING FOR ANTIDOTES TO VIOLENCE 

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the report of the UN secretary-general, August,2006

 Over the past decade, we have been reminded that the United Nations peacekeeping plays a crucial role in securing individual and political peace and security. Missions such as those in Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Balkans have been central to my tenure. 

 When I became Secretary-General, the United Nations had fewer than 13,000 troops deployed worldwide and was recovering from the setbacks of the early Nineties. Today 65,500 troops and more than 15,000 international and local civilian personnel serve in 15 peacekeeping operations in Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Timor-Leste. In 1997, military and police personnel were drawn from about 70 countries versus over 100 countries currently. In 1998, 4 out of the top 10 contributors of troops were developing countries, whereas today all 10 are developing countries.

 The past year has witnessed the successful transition from peacekeeping to peacebuilding in Sierra Leone and support for the organization of fair elections from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Burundi and Haiti. In the particularly challenging environments of Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, peacekeeping operations have facilitated complex transitional political processes. 

 But the year has also brought harsh reminders of the fact that the risk of failure is high. We withdrew our peacekeepers from Sierra Leone in December 2005. However, while we pulled our last soldiers from Timor-Leste in May 2005, within just one year an international force had returned to the country as it slipped back towards violence. Meanwhile, progress in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was tempered by violent incidents in the eastern part of the country, which highlighted the hostile environment in which our peacekeeping operations take place.

 The transformation of United Nations peacekeeping is not only numerical. Our traditional role of monitoring ceasefires remains very important, but we have become deeply engaged in facilitating political processes to give countries and territories emerging from conflict the opportunity for legitimate government. 

 This has been particularly important in, for example, Kosovo, where the United Nations has served as the interim administration and is now leading the political process to determine Kosovos future. In addition, in 2005 alone, over 50 million registered voters had the chance to participate in elections overseen by United Nations peacekeeping missions. Because we recognize that voting alone does not bring stable politics, we are increasingly engaged in helping governments to reform their security sectors and in providing social services to all.

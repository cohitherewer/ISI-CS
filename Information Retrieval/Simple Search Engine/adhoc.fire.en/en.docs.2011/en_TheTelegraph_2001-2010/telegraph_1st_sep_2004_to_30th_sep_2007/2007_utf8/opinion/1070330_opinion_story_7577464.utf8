 UNUSUAL AND UPLIFTING NOVEL

 Salmon fishing in the 

 Yemen By Paul Torday, Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson,

 pound; 6.50

 This is a poignant and an unusual novel. The very name suggests 

 its unusualness. Whoever has ever heard of salmon jumping 

 in some obscure wadi in the Yemen? Yet this is precisely 

 one of the major themes of the book. Its name is not intended 

 as an allegory of something more profound or funny. But 

 the novel is out of the ordinary in more ways than just 

 its title. In fact, it is quite breathtaking in its originality.

 The style is simple, if not austere, and detached. This is dictated by the form Paul Torday has chosen for his debut novel. The story is told through a series of e-mails exchanged between some of the main characters, through excerpts of interviews conducted by a special committee of the House of Commons, through media clippings and through excerpts from the autobiography of the British prime ministers director of communications. Therefore, the novel lacks one uniform narrative voice. The story is told from various angles and perspectives and the reader is left to piece them together.

 At the core of the story is the dream of a Yemeni sheikh, Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama, who wanted to introduce salmon fishing in his country. Through his land agent Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, an employee of Fitzharris amp; Price, in St Jamess Street, London, the sheikh established contact with Fred Jones, an expert on fishes, especially the salmon. Fred, when the project of creating a salmon river in the highlands of Yemen is first presented to him, rejects it as absurd. But the project receives the support of some British politicians and their spin doctors who see in the idea an opportunity to deflect attention from the unpleasant reports emanating from the Middle East. Fred is left with no option but to agree to take the project forward.

 Freds attitudes undergo a transformation under the persuasive powers of the elegant Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, and, more importantly, by the influence of Sheikh Muhammad ibn Zaidi. The latters devoutness, faith, humility and goodness cast a spell on Fred Jones who begins to believe in the impossible.

 He in fact achieved the impossible and it seemed possible that salmon would jump in a wadi in the Yemen. Reports of the successful completion of the project draws in the British prime minister who is eager to capitalize on the angler vote. He decides to travel to the Yemen to open the project and to be photographed catching salmon there. The lure of the photo-op hastens the novels denouement.

 The main story line, conveyed in a jagged way because of the novels form, is supported by certain side themes. There is the growing, if unfulfilled, attraction between Harriet and Fred. Harriet suffers a traumatic loss when her fianc dies in a clandestine operation in Iran. Freds own marriage comes under increasing strain because of his involvement in the project. And there is the attempt by the al-Qaida to assassinate the sheikh because of his closeness to the British political establishment.

 Neither the side stories nor the disjointed character that the form imposes takes away from the simple charm of the story. The novel has an ineffable, elevating quality. Its detachment and its understated tone are the novels real strengths.

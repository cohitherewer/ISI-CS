 GENIUS AGAINST HUBRIS

 Babur at Panipat, 1526

 Indias Historic Battles: from Alexander the great to Kargil 

 By Kaushik Roy, Permanent Black, Rs 495 

 John Keegan, in his book, A History of Warfare, demolishes Carl von Clausewitzs famous definition of war as the continuation of policy by other means. War not only pre-dates the modern notion of politics and the state but it may outlast that notion as well. Clausewitz had failed to account for the impact of culture on something so fundamental to human civilization. Yet, it may be argued that the non-military factors and the context remaining the same, the result of a particular war might still have been different. 

 Kaushik Roys book is an attempt to rescue Clausewitzs focus on the individual battle and examine if chance, luck and individual leadership might have written a different military history for India. He de-emphasizes the Marxist and post-modernist stress on the contextual factors and argues for the use of military theory. For instance, had Paurava the aggression and tactical intelligence to cross the Jhelum and surprise Alexanders scattered reconnaissance troops, the Battle of Jhelum could have ended in his favour. Or, had it not been raining the night the Macedonian crossed the river, his army might have been decimated in transit.

 Indias Historic Battles studies twelve decisive battles that shaped Indias destiny. Each chapter first contextualizes and then describes the battle by linking weapons, strategy and leadership. What follows is an alternative scenario that investigates if the outcome could have been different with a change in strategy and tactics. While this analysis is undoubtedly the books distinction, it nevertheless is also its fundamental weakness. In looking at what could have happened had Paurava, Prithviraj Chauhan, Ibrahim Lodhi et al shown a little tactical imagination and flexibility, Roys thesis contradicts his central emphasis on the battle itself. A pattern emerges to show that the Indian side was, in each case, irrevocably compromised by its military culture, the feudal set-up and the ordnance technology, and not just by leadership.

 In other words, the alternative history, in most cases, would be possible only by changes in the larger factors. Chance does play a role in turning the course of events, as in the accidental death of Hemu at Panipat in 1556. But the examples of Prithviraj, Lodhi or Balaji Baji Rao demonstrate how their cultural context ultimately determined their fates, after discounting personal traits and the play of fortune. Military strategy and technology are, after all, cultural products. The Marathas, for instance, could have used guerrilla warfare against Ahmed Shah Abdali. But they could not because of the complacency and lethargy caused by wealth and hegemony. In fact, Roy admits that the conditions for an alternative history usually did not exist and tactical improvisations would, at the most, have produced minor variations in the outcome.

 Roy draws parallels between battles fought in the distant past and those closer to our own times to show how the history of warfare is characterized by continuities and discontinuities. Such comparisons also argue against linear determinism in military history. Armies and nations do not necessarily learn from past mistakes or grow inevitably larger nor are new techniques automatically copied and made redundant. The last chapter on battles concludes with the grim reminder that the probable Pakistani objective at Kargil forcing a third-party intervention in Kashmir may arise again in the future.

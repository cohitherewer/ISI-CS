 Be very very afraid

Have stick, will beat

 Sir Bihar turned into a barbaric state during the reign of Lalu Prasad and later, of his wife (Blinding then, bike now, Aug 29). Even though Lalu Prasads family and party have been removed from power, Bihar still finds it difficult to change old habits. Aurangzeb, the thief who snatched a chain from a lady, surely did not merit the brutal treatment that he got he was beaten up and then tied to a motorcycle and dragged around till he fell unconscious. Now that the policemen responsible for the assault have been fired, the deputy inspector general of Bhagalpur range, G.N. Sharma, should also be punished for suggesting that the media reports were an attempt to malign the police. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

 Sir The Bhagalpur incident was, to say the least, horrific. It was shocking to see men in uniform abetting the mobs madness instead of controlling it. However, the worst criminals in the episode were the media. Throughout the day, all news channels, especially the Hindi ones, played the footage, trying to differentiate between insaaniyat (humanity) and haivaniyat (barbarism). Was it not the duty of the media as watchdogs to stop the brutality first? But then, they would have lost a sensational piece of news. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir The more incompetent our police in catching hard core criminals, the greater their high-handedness with petty offenders and innocent citizens. In India, the guards truly need to be guarded.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Mahapatro, Berhampore, Orissa

 Sir One wonders if Bihar still lives in medieval times. The recent case of inhuman conduct in Bhagalpur is a reminder of the infamous Bhagalpur blindings of 1981. The Nitish Kumar government was elected on the promise of peace and prosperity. But the continuing instances of abduction, rape and murder prove that the government has failed to restore its own authority and the peoples faith in the law. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir What happened in Bhagalpur is a clear example of how the judiciarys failure to give timely verdicts has made law-breakers fearless. The police are being forced to do what they did at Bhagalpur to prevent criminals from getting away repeatedly. However, while everyone is chastizing the police, nobody is asking what may have made them resort to such violence. The thief had been caught and put in jail twice. His thefts had become frequent. He was not caught by chance, but only after the local residents set a trap for him. Ordinary Biharis, frustrated with the poor administration, turned their anger on the thief. This is not to justify the publics or the polices action but to argue that under a just administration, such an incident would not have taken place. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Jha, Jamshedpur

 Sir The events in Bhagalpur constituted a serious attempt to murder. All human beings possess criminal instincts that get the better of them sometimes. On such occasions, the age and educational qualifications of the wrong-doer become irrelevant. Nor is he mindful of the consequences of his action. It is important that Indians realize who the more heinous offender is in the Bhagalpur case the cops or the thief.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Jamal Ahmad, Patna

 Sir It is good that the errant policemen from Bhagalpur have been fired. But they deserved more severe punishment. The National Human Rights Commission rightly took cognizance of the incident. But on what ground did the National Minorities Commission intervene? It will only communalize the incident unnecessarily. Thieves have no religion. Nor is public and police brutality directed at thieves from any particular community. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Complaints against the police and armed forces from Kashmir to Manipur to Nandigram speak of the state of insecurity that Indians live in. Almost 70 per cent of the complaints received by the NHRC pertain to violation of human rights by the police, says a recent article by a former director general of the NHRC. How is it any better than the days under British rule? Thanks to the intervention of the media, the Bhagalpur incident has caught the attention of the authorities and timely action has been taken, unlike after the blindings in 1981. This shows how effective the media have been in making the people and the administrators sit up and act. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ranadhish Choudhuri, Calcutta

 WHO PAYS FOR 

 IT? 

 - It is the poor who will be the main victims of climate change

 Global warming is no longer merely 

 a future prospect. The latest reports of the Inter-governmental 

 Panel on Climate Change show that we are already witnessing 

 climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels. Ironically, 

 those least responsible for causing climate change will 

 be its worst victims.

 Human activities have generated 

 carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases since the dawn 

 of history. But it is only in the Industrial Age, with the 

 ever-expanding consumption of hydrocarbon fuels and the 

 resultant increase in carbon dioxide emissions, that greenhouse 

 gas concentrations have reached levels causing climate change. 

 All inhabitants of our planet have an equal right to the 

 atmosphere, but the industrialized countries have greatly 

 exceeded their fair, per-capita share of the planets atmospheric 

 resources and have induced climate change. If all countries 

 had the same per-capita emissions as India, for example, 

 humanity would not have faced a climate-change problem.

 Unfortunately, it is the worlds 

 poor who will be the main victims of climate change. In 

 most developing countries, a large proportion of the population 

 is engaged in traditional farming, an occupation that is 

 particularly vulnerable to the changes in temperature, rainfall 

 and extreme weather events associated with climate change. 

 By contrast, in most developed countries, a large majority 

 of the population is engaged in the industrial or services 

 sectors, which are less directly dependent on climate stability. 

 Moreover, developed countries 

 possess the capital, technological and human resources required 

 for successful adaptation. They will be able to construct 

 embankments to protect coastal areas against sea-level rise 

 and to build dwellings that will not be blown away in a 

 hurricane. Farmers in these countries will be able to switch 

 over to new seeds or plant varieties, new agricultural practices, 

 new crops or even new occupations. They will not lack the 

 financial or knowledge resources needed for investing in, 

 say, patented seeds or drip irrigation and other water conservation 

 measures.

 Developing countries will find 

 it much more difficult to adapt to climate change because 

 they lack the requisite resources in terms of capital, technology 

 and knowledge-based skills. It follows that, for low-income 

 countries, the key to a successful response to climate change 

 is accelerated development. Unless they achieve rapid development, 

 these countries will remain woefully lacking in the financial, 

 technological and human resources required for adapting 

 to climate change in coming decades. Accelerated development 

 is essential to ensure that future generations in these 

 countries are able to cope successfully with global warming.

 Adapting to climate change can 

 only be a partial solution. The international community 

 must address the problem of mitigating, or limiting, global 

 warming. What role should developing countries play in the 

 international response to mitigate climate change? What 

 is a fair or equitable distribution of responsibilities 

 between industrialized and developing countries in the international 

 response to climate change?

 Since the industrialized countries 

 are responsible for causing climate change, equity requires 

 that they should sharply reduce their emissions in order 

 to arrest further climate change and allow other countries 

 access to their fair share of atmospheric resources in order 

 to develop. Moreover, the industrialized countries also 

 possess the financial and technological resources required 

 for an adequate international response to climate change. 

 The role of the industrialized countries should reflect 

 their responsibility for causing climate change and their 

 greater capability for effectively addressing the challenge.

 Thus, the UN Framework Convention 

 on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol require industrialized 

 countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. These 

 countries, with the exception of the former Soviet bloc 

 economies in transition are also required to transfer 

 financial resources and technology to developing countries 

 for mitigation and adaptation purposes.

 This does not mean that the developing 

 countries have no commitments at all. All countries, including 

 developing countries, have accepted a common commitment 

 to implement measures to mitigate climate change. However, 

 developing countries are not expected to divert scarce financial 

 resources from their development priorities. They are only 

 expected to implement measures involving no additional costs, 

 where reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is a co-benefit 

 or by-product of measures primarily intended to promote 

 development priorities such as energy efficiency, energy 

 security or local environmental concerns relating to water 

 or air pollution. Projects involving additional costs are 

 required to be taken up only if the industrialized countries 

 meet these costs.

 This is explicitly spelt out in 

 the Framework Convention in words that deserve to be quoted: 

 The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively 

 implement their commitments under the Convention will depend 

 on the effective implementation by developed country Parties 

 of their commitments under the Convention related to financial 

 resources and transfer of technology, and will fully take 

 into account that economic and social development and poverty 

 eradication are the first and overriding priority of the 

 developing country Parties. 

 The industrialized countries are 

 now pressing for a revision of this basic compact. Skirting 

 around the question of equity and responsibility, they are 

 calling upon developing countries to strike some sort of 

 a balance between development and reduction of greenhouse 

 gas emissions. The argument runs that industrialized countries 

 will not be able, on their own, to effect reductions in 

 emissions on the scale required to restrict climate change 

 to acceptable limits and it is, therefore, necessary for 

 developing countries to curb their rising greenhouse gas 

 emissions, even if this entails some diversion of scarce 

 resources from their development priorities. This obviously 

 has profound implications for development, poverty eradication, 

 environmental protection and the future welfare of a majority 

 of the worlds population.

 T he argument advanced by the 

 industrialized countries is misleading because no one questions 

 the need to moderate emissions originating in the developing 

 countries to the extent this is feasible. The real question 

 is, Who pays for it? The Framework Convention lays down 

 that all incremental costs are to be met by the industrialized 

 countries. These countries are now trying to change the 

 compact by shifting at least a part of the burden to the 

 developing countries by imposing mandatory obligations on 

 the latter.

 The proposal is not only inequitable 

 but also deeply flawed as a response to climate change. 

 By slowing down economic and social development, it would 

 deal a severe blow at the efforts of poorer countries to 

 build up their medium- and long-term adaptive capacity. 

 Moreover, it would distort the proper environmental priorities 

 of developing countries. In most of these countries, water 

 and air pollution and the lack of proper sanitation pose 

 an environmental challenge that is just as serious as climate 

 change and much more immediate. While the dire threats 

 of global climate change will appear in coming decades, 

 these local environmental problems are even today taking 

 a heavy toll in human lives and misery. Not surprisingly, 

 they are accorded correspondingly high priority in the development 

 plans of poorer countries. Diversion of scarce resources 

 to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions would distort 

 the environmental priorities appropriate to poorer countries. 

 It must be recognized that affluent and poorer countries 

 have different environmental priorities.

 Low-income countries should firmly 

 reject any proposal that requires diversion of scarce resources 

 from their economic, social and local environmental priorities. 

 Their development goals must not be sacrificed. Only rapid 

 development can enable them to adapt to climate change with 

 any degree of success.

 GRIM FACTS 

 Stephen Hugh-Jones

 Wordcage

 What is the English languages 

 most overworked clich? In my Mumbai days, 45 years ago, 

 one led the field by lengths. Or maybe I should write was 

 in pole position, another sporting phrase, from motor-racing 

 rather than horse-racing, which is used these days in umpteen 

 inappropriate contexts.

 But the phrase concerned was neither 

 of these. It was grim determination. India was invaded 

 by the Chinese, and grim determination flowed from 

 every politicians lips and every journalists typewriter. 

 So, maybe, it should have been. Determination when your 

 country is under attack is a very good thing. But why grim? 

 The basic meaning of that word 

 is stern or harsh. Fair enough in phrases 

 like a grim smile or indeed grim necessity. 

 But it is already a step to transfer the adjective to ones 

 own, or ones armys own, response to these phenomena. To 

 make that transfer almost compulsory, so there is no determination 

 without a grim in front of it, is a step too far.

 It is further unwise to import 

 the words to inappropriate contexts. These days one may 

 show grim determination on almost any topic, from a hard-fought 

 cricket match to fighting climate change or indeed (I exaggerate 

 only slightly) being insulted on Big Brother. That 

 is the mark of the clich. It starts life as a perfectly 

 acceptable phrase. It then gets extended to places where 

 it shouldnt be. It boots out other phrases that could be 

 used: why not stubborn determination or fierce 

 determination or indeed plain determination on 

 its own? It then gets wildly overused.

 An obvious example is winning 

 hearts and minds. This began life as what the Americans 

 thought they needed to do in the then South Vietnam. Winning 

 battles was not enough, they must win the backing of the 

 Vietnamese people too.

 In its origin, it was a neat and 

 well-chosen phrase. The anti-communist cause needed both 

 the emotional support of the heart and the practical support 

 of reason, the feeling, say, that well be better off if 

 the Americans win.

 It was neat, and many clichs 

 indeed started life not just as neat but as brilliant pieces 

 of imagination. There are many phrases from Shakespeare 

 and other poets that have passed into the language, as there 

 are from the 1611 authorized translation of the Bible, 

 or the old English prayer book. In their originators mouths 

 these were appropriate, clever and above all fresh.

 Wide use can make such phrases 

 proverbial, and our or any language has many more: such 

 practical or rueful thoughts as it never rains but it 

 pours are still live, useful and usable. But wide and 

 thoughtless repetition can make a once-live phrase a dead 

 one. Surely one can try to win peoples hearts without having 

 to win their minds as well? Or vice versa. Not in 

 any journalists copy you cant. Alas just as, alas, the 

 proper response these days to anyone who uses to be or 

 not to be except in a theatre is a groan.

 A clichs source may be high 

 or low. If it aint broke, dont fix it is sound 

 advice but by now a clich. No less is Jane Austens it 

 is a truth universally accepted. Journalists are indeed 

 often to blame. Some original mind among fashion writers 

 dreamed up I dont know who or when the lively notion 

 that (for example) green is the new black, meaning 

 that green was the universal colour of the season. By now 

 every fashion writer in Britain and many other of us hacks 

 have overused versions of this idea to the point where it 

 is dead (or should I write dead as the dodo?).

 Its hard to say where proverbial 

 becomes clich; a phrase thats dead to me may still be 

 live to you. But if enough people think some phrase is a 

 clich, almost by definition they are right. As the saying 

 goes or is it a clich? you cant define an elephant, 

 but you for sure know when you see one. The same is true 

 of clichs. If it looks like a clich and quacks like a 

 clich, you can be pretty sure it is a clich. Which is 

 enough clichs from me.

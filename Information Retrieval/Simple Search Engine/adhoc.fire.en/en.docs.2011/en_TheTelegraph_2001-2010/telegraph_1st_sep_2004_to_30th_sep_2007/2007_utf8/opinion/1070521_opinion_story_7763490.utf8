 Rightly served

 More wrong than right

 Sir It is good to know that a man as influential as the Rashtriya Janata Dal member of the Lok Sabha, Mohammed Shahabuddin, can be sentenced to life, and that too in a state like Bihar (Life term for Lalu MP, May 9). This conviction is a triumph of the judiciary as it proves that even a VIP can be made to pay the wages of his crime. One can now expect that the more high profile politicians, who lead a double life as hard-core criminals, will be brought under the purview of the law. However, one cannot hope too much, given the fact that it has taken eight long years after Chhotelal Gupta was abducted by Shahabuddin for the latter to be sentenced. Politicians in India repeatedly manipulate the law to suit their ends and prevent the law from taking its course. Only if the powers of the judiciary are expanded manifold can the public be assured of fast trials and quick judgment. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Mohammed Shahabuddin could not have enjoyed the degree of power he wielded in Bihar without the tacit support of the RJD chief, Lalu Prasad. In fact, it is through his handymen like Shahabuddin that Prasad had established absolute control over the state during his and his wifes tenures as the chief ministers of Bihar. Prasads involvement in the case of disproportionate assets and the fodder scam are just two of his sins that have come to light. But he remains responsible for thousands of other unrecorded misdeeds. The chaotic law and order situation that prevails in Bihar today is largely his creation. The law can start functioning normally in Bihar only by striking right at the fountainhead of corruption, Lalu Prasad. That is not to say that the conviction of Shahabuddin is of no importance. But now that the judiciary has shown that it is capable of passing judgments even on the powerful, it should not stop short at nailing dons like Shahabuddin. Even a Union minister like Prasad should be punished if he deserves it. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Tusar Kanti Kar,

 Sir It is shameful that Lalu Prasad, a Union cabinet minister, who also happens to be an influential leader of the United Progressive Alliance, chooses not to comment on the verdict condemning RJD MP Mohammed Shahabuddin. But he talks of everyones right of appeal, perhaps implying that Shahabuddin will contest the sentence of life-imprisonment awarded to him by a Siwan court. If Prasad chooses to use his influence to save Shahabuddin, then the latter might again escape the law. This would be regrettable since Shahabuddin thoroughly deserves the judgment he has got, guilty as he is of carrying out a kidnap, probably a murder, and armed raids. 

 However, even if Shahabuddin gets to serve his sentence, he will hardly be treated as other criminals are. Former Union minister, Shibu Soren, who had been packed off to prison some months ago, is surely enjoying a luxurious life in jail now. If India is to be considered a democracy then all its criminals should get equal treatment, irrespective of the position they had enjoyed before conviction. And no degree of political support should be able to make a convict enjoy immunity from the law. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Something ill

 Sir After reading the report, Weak witness nails big boy (May 18), it appears that the BMW hit-and-run case of 1999 has been handled in a very lax manner. This could have been because of undue pressure on the investigating agencies. Or perhaps the power of the rich in this country did the trick. Now that Sunil Kulkarni, who was earlier dismissed as a weak witness, has deposed, the case should be opened afresh. Kulkarni should be given police protection so that he cannot be harmed or threatened by the rich and powerful friends of the defendant. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta,

 Sir Among the chiefs of the three services, navy chiefs have been traditionally found to have an affinity to be sucked into controversies. One was sacked, anothers close relative, also working for the Indian navy, was involved in strategic leaks, and a thirds son and grandson are, respectively, an arms dealer accused of receiving kickbacks in defence deals and an imbecile brat who thinks nothing of driving his car over a few men. Junior commissioned officers are not sitting idle either. Only last week, Manish Thakur killed his female friend after cheating on her. All these are tarnishing the navys image among the public. Bright young men cannot be blamed for thinking twice before joining a force with history of such deviant behaviour. Unless there is an image makeover, the Indian navy will find it hard to fill its ranks with quality people. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Chameli Pal, 

 Batanagar

 ITS ALL IN THE MIND

 Few winners of the Nobel Prize for economics are household names. But the film A Beautiful Mind made John Nash a celebrity even in India, as he is discovering

 John Forbes Nash is a reluctant celebrity. The arclights are on him and he looks old and weary in the glare. Just this month, at least three Nobel laureates have visited India. Two of the three all equally accomplished and distinguished in global academic circles have landed and left without much ado or fanfare. But Nash is the chosen darling of the media. 

 The ensuing circus, however, has little to do with his pioneering work in mathematics and game theory. The point of interest is the award-winning film A Beautiful Mind, starring Russell Crowe. It was the film that shot Nash out of academic circles and into dinner table conversations, making him a household name. 

 But Nash sits slouched in a plush armchair in the Maurya Sheraton in south Delhi, visibly exhausted and besieged by reporters. This has been like a business trip, he says quietly, burrowing deeper into the armchair. 

 Nash is in India for a week on the invitation of the ministry of external affairs to flag off its new Nobel Laureate Lecture series. Within three days of being in Delhi, he has delivered a public lecture and met the Prime Minister and the President. He was in Bangalore on Friday to meet Infosys chief mentor Narayana Murthy, and then in Mumbai for a lecture on Ideal Money and Asymptotically Ideal Money. 

 Worn out after a day trip to Delhis landmarks and a constant salvo of questions and meetings, 79-year-old Nash just sits silently, surrounded by his wife, Alicia and his son, John Martin. Its a surreal picture Nash carries a humungous calculator, and John, a book called Windows for Dummies. 

 But surreal, really, is better used to describe Nashs roller-coaster ride of a life. A PhD holder at 22, he went on to solve many of the seemingly impenetrable mathematical challenges of the time. His interest in mathematics was kindled when he was a young boy and read the book Men of Mathematics by E.T. Bell. But it was his slender 27-page doctoral thesis, Non-cooperative Games, as a Princeton student on game theory that won him the Nobel Prize for economic sciences in 1994. 

 Nashs work on game theory is the central nerve of the field. I use the Nash Equilibrium in half of my work, says US-based Pradeep Dubey, game theorist and a personal friend of Nash. Nash established the mathematical principles of game theory, which offers to explain the complicated process through which governments, corporations and individuals reach strategic options. Game theory can be applied to almost anything, from a conflict situation to international negotiations to marriages. A lesser known fact about Nash is that he co-invented two famous games, Hex and So Long Sucker, which are still played across campuses. 

 But as young Nash stood at the edge of what was expected to be an extraordinary career dotted with achievements, fate had other designs. The debilitating illness of paranoid schizophrenia and irrational voices in his head gradually drove Nash out of academic elite circles and frequently banished him into involuntary confinements in hospitals. But even during the so-called irrational period of his life, Nash published numerous papers which have inspired subsequent work as well. 

 But the brief periods of remission were like coming up for air, as he kept slipping back every time. It took him nearly 25 years to finally shake off the illness. During these years, Nash came to be known as the Phantom of the Fine Hall in Princeton, where he wandered about silently, doodling arcane equations on blackboards. Nash was slowly able to defeat the disease without hospitals or medication. 

 Apart from his innate genius, Nashs stalwart has been Alicia, his wife, friend and loyal companion. Married in 1957, Alicia was pregnant with their first child when Nash started to decline into a delusional abyss. By 1963, Alicia and Nash were divorced, though she did take him back as a lodger in 1970. Alicias faith and patience were instrumental in Nashs re-emergence as a normal mathematician. 

 He was back to normal life in Princeton by the time the Nobel was announced. He asked me to stay at home and listen to the phone. Finally I think I answered it and we were both, said Alicia throwing up her hands. 

 Alicia re-married Nash in 2001, after 38 years. Her life has been dedicated to Nash, through illness and recovery, and to their son. Unfortunately, Martin has also been diagnosed with schizophrenia and has suffered nervous breakdowns. It is like dj vu. But an illness is an illness. Knowing about it or living it twice doesnt cure it, says Alicia. 

 Nash is a deeply private person. He refused to dole out personal details either for the highly acclaimed biography A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar, or the motion picture. He once told me that he was relieved to see the movie because he didnt feel that his privacy was invaded. Its a take-off on his life. The film showed Nash breaking a lot of codes for the US government but I dont think he did that, says Dubey. 

 And to answer the oft-asked question, Nash does not look anything like the pumped-up Crowe in the film. But Martin uncannily resembles Crowe, towering over everyone in a baseball cap. 

 Nashs life is scripted almost along cinematic lines, as if it were always meant to be one. From early childhood, through the prolific years of his youth, tortured delusions and then back to a normal life, mathematics has always stood by him. Ironically, his greatest award in 1994 was not for his work in pure mathematics but for economics. And that too for his work in the 1950s. Nash should have received the Nobel years back. To give it so late makes the Nobel prize slightly less noble, says Dubey. 

 For all his personal and academic milestones, people close to Nash say he is grounded and considerate an individual without airs. He is very real. He is like a little boy, says actress Lushin Dubey, a friend to both Alicia and Nash. And just as the three of them walk away to another busy evening, Nash turns back slowly to add, I would have liked to see more of the Indian countryside. Maybe another time. Just like he said in 1950, for a perfect solution, you win some, you lose some.

 REMEDY FOR ENGLISH 

 Wordcage

 Stephen Hugh-Jones

 What does ghoti mean? (In 

 English, not Bengali, that is.) A beard as sported by that 

 Kentucky Fried colonel, maybe? And how is it pronounced? 

 Answer: it has no meaning, and it is pronounced fish. 

 Yes, fish: gh as in tough, o 

 as in women and ti as in any word ending in 

 -tion. 

 Ghoti was dreamed up by 

 Bernard Shaw to illustrate the absurdities of English spelling. 

 So it does. But what it has never done is persuade anyone, 

 or at least enough people, that phonetic spelling, as Shaw 

 proposed, would be an improvement. He left a large sum in 

 his will to promote that cause. He was not the first. One 

 Charles Butler, a rural clergyman, used phonetic spelling 

 for a new edition of his treatise on bees as early as 1634.

 The reverend bee-keeper was no 

 fool. His was the first book in English to point out that 

 a bee-hive is ruled by a queen, not a king. And, quite rightly, 

 he thought the spelling of English which in his days was 

 not even uniform was crazy. But could he get users to 

 accept his remedy? No.

 A few later scholars tried, and 

 failed. When the Philological Society met in 1881, a traditionalist 

 recorded, two such scholars had to admit that while they 

 had the same aims, the means by which they sought to attain 

 them were altogether different, and, in the judgment of 

 each, all which the other was doing in setting forth results 

 equally dear to both was only tending to make the attainment 

 of those results remoter than ever. 

 This critic, Richard Chenevix 

 Trench, was an archbishop; and for once its a rare event 

 in the Anglican Church the archbishop was right and the 

 humble priest 250 years earlier mistaken. Phonetic spelling 

 is fine in Italian or Spanish, and many other languages; 

 though in all of them regional differences of speech cast 

 doubt on just how phonetic it really is. And if the English-speaking 

 world could agree on the changes, wed surely all get used 

 to them: wots rong with fonetik, eniwei? 

 Agree to disagree

 But would we agree? After 76 years 

 of trying, Portugal and Brazil have not standardized the 

 spelling of Portuguese. Many big German-language newspapers 

 have rejected a recent, officially backed and very minor 

 reform of its spelling. Imagine trying to get agreement 

 on a root-and-branch reform of English not just in Britain 

 but from America, Australia, India and Google.

 More important, we should not 

 try. English is an utterly mongrel language. Its links to 

 its multiple roots are obscure already. Its pronunciation 

 is a madhouse. Why seek to bring order to this asylum by 

 putting the lunatics in charge? Archbishop Trench was surely 

 right to argue that every word has two existences, as a 

 spoken word and a written, and you have no right to sacrifice 

 one to the other. 

 And what would it lead to? I 

 can conceive no method of so effectually defacing and barbarizing 

 our English tongue, of practically emptying it of all its 

 hoarded wit, wisdom, imagination and history, of cutting 

 the vital nerve which connects its present with the past 

 as phonetic spelling. 

 Im not sure about the wit and 

 wisdom, but Trenchs reference to history was spot-on. I 

 doubt that we suffer as he felt from writing fancy, 

 rather than the phantsy, an echo of the Greek phantasia, 

 used by scholars in the 17th century. But a great many of 

 our words indeed spring from Latin or Greek. Why deliberately 

 deprive them of their background and thus their resonance? 

 Even if we had the letters Shaw 

 reckoned wed need 44 instead of 26 and were happy to 

 outdate every keyboard in the English-speaking world. No, 

 forget it. Francis Bacon four centuries ago called the idea 

 an unprofitable subtlety. He was too mild. Its a nonsense.

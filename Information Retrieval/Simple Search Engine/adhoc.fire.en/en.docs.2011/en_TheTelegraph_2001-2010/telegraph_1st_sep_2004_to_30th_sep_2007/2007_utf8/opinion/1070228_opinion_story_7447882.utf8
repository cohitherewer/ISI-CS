 TURN THE LIGHTS LOW

 Gwynne Dyer

 Astonishingly, it was Australias liberal government, so deeply sunk in climate change denial for so long, that took the radical step of banning incandescent light bulbs. But then, John Howard, the prime minister, faces an election later this year, and Australia has been suffering from the worst and the longest drought in its modern history. So the electorate has been getting worried about climate change.

 Severe drought is the main predicted effect of global warming in the temperate regions of the globe. Australia is already the most arid of the worlds inhabited continents, and speculation has been mounting that the current drought may portend a drastic fall in the countrys ability to grow food. A political gesture was needed, and the light bulb industry is a lot easier to take on than the coal industry.

 The gesture is cynical, but it is also amazingly effective. As the environment minister, Bill Turnbull, pointed out, If the whole world switches to these (fluorescent) bulbs today, we would reduce our consumption of electricity (worldwide) by an amount equal to five times Australias annual consumption of electricity. In other words, it would be like turning off all the lights, fans, televisions, computers, fridges, ovens and air conditioners in Japan, and most of the industrial machinery as well. That is a quick fix that would really make a difference.

 The incandescent bulb was invented 125 years ago, and has changed little since. Only five per cent of the electricity it consumes is converted into light, with most being wasted as heat, but it still accounts for the vast majority of the bulbs that light homes and workplaces around the world. The compact florescent bulb that should have replaced it long ago uses only one-fifth as much electricity, and lasts ten to twenty times as long.

 Nice surprise

 Compact fluorescent bulbs are more expensive, and early ones gave a cold, white light that many people did not like (but that has been remedied in newer models). They cannot replace spotlights, candle bulbs, or halogen lights, and they are trickier to recycle. But they could replace 99 per cent of conventional incandescent bulbs in a year or two, and the countrys average electricity consumption would immediately fall by about two per cent. 

 It is a cheap, quick, one-time fix, but we need such fixes because the situation is much worse than the experts thought even five years ago. What we do in the next 10 or 20 years will make the difference between a 1.5-degrees-celsius hotter world and a 3-degrees-celsius hotter world in the future. That is probably the difference between great discomfort and inconvenience on the one hand, and famine, refugee flows and war on the other.

 Climate change is cumulative. With greenhouse emissions distorting the climate further, quick fixes are not to be despised. Even if the tipping point has finally arrived in terms of public attitudes towards climate change, it will take years to translate good intentions into global treaties. Changing the light-bulbs is something we can do this year.

 There are other quick fixes that could offer comparable returns. Just banning all electrical appliances whose standby function consumes more than one watt of power would cut emissions by an estimated one per cent. (The standby function means that the appliance comes on right away, rather than warming up for a few seconds first)

 So here is to Fidel Castro (who started switching Cuba to compact fluorescent bulbs two years ago) and to Hugo Chavez (now doing the same in Venezuela) and to their comrade-in-arms, John Howard, in Australia. And lawmakers in California and New Jersey are also proposing a ban on these bulbs. Virtue flourishes in the most unexpected places.

 Paper tigers

 Sir Indian cricketers have lived up to Ricky Pontings comment that they are paper tigers on foreign soil (Bangla shock, March 18). Indians must acknowledge that our team has the most overrated cricketers in the world. We tend to remember only the best performances of our players. Thus we still recall Virender Sehwags 309 against Pakistan and Rahul Dravids double tons in tests. Likewise, there may be a move afoot to forgive and forget the loss against Bangladesh because of the victory against Bermuda (probably the weakest team in the tournament), in which Sehwag scored a century. In cricket, it does not pay to live in the past. Indians are an inconsistent lot who cannot be relied upon to beat a strong team on a given day. It is needless to say that the team owes its current plight to the stupid and arrogant trio of Greg Chappell, Dravid and the former chairman of selectors, Kiran More. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Chakravarti, Calcutta

 Sir Indias performance against Bangladesh is enough to destroy ones faith in Indian cricket, so what if it was followed by the record-setting score against Bermuda. It is inexplicable how a batting line-up as strong as Indias can fail time and again, especially on tracks favouring pace bowlers. The team management has to take a few apparently harsh decisions if Indias World Cup hopes are to be kept alive. Besides, it is time Indians learnt not to take teams like Bangladesh lightly. The usual categories of strong and weak become irrelevant in a tournament like the World Cup.

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Jha, Bangalore

 Sir The real reason behind the humiliation suffered by India and Pakistan at the hands of Bangladesh and Ireland respectively is that players from these smaller teams play the game without expectations of big money. On the other hand, Indian and Pakistani players exhibited a very casual approach to the tournament from the beginning. All their energies seem to be spent on securing lucrative endorsement contracts. Both the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the Pakistan Cricket Board should forbid their cricketers from accepting endorsement offers till their retirement. If the BCCI and the PCB do not heed this advice, cricket will soon become extinct in both India and Pakistan. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir Since cricket has been commercialized beyond redemption, I suggest that cricketers, especially Indians, be put on commission. They should earn according to the way they play. If their performance in a match is poor, they should get only 25 per cent of their match fees and other earnings. If the performance is average, they should be paid about 50 per cent. For a moderate win, they should get 75 per cent, and a 100 per cent payment should be made only if they thrash their opponents. If the victory margin is big, the team might in fact be given a 10 per cent bonus. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir Indias pathetic performance against Bangladesh questions the wisdom of state governments bestowing hard-earned public money, prime lands and other benefits on cricketers for performances in particular matches. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is one such beneficiary of the largesse of a state government. Such undue rewards and the minting of money through endorsement contracts are the major reasons for the frequently-poor performances of Indian cricketers. Such easy money distracts and tempts cricketers and keeps them from focussing on the game. These days, one wonders whether Indian cricketers take even their practice sessions seriously. But losses such as the one to Bangladesh also evince a systemic failure. Politics should not be allowed to interfere in the team selection any longer. In fact, the team should be selected by a computer, which would take into account the recent performances of individual players as well as scientific analyses of their strengths and weaknesses. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir I felt sad watching India lose their first match in the World Cup to Bangladesh despite winning the crucial toss. That Rahul Dravid decided to bat first is mysterious. It reminds one of the decisions made by Mohammad Azharuddin in Eden Gardens in the 1996 World Cup semi-final against Sri Lanka, and those by Sourav Ganguly in the 2003 final. The Indians are gaining quite a reputation for making a mess of what should be an easy job. It is time we switched to other sports to avoid such periodic humiliation.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Hussain, Sonari, Assam

 Sir Rahul Dravids egotism and arrogance are boundless. For a whole year, he has been supporting non-performers like Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh, ignoring consistent players like Dinesh Kaarthik and Ramesh Powar. As long as non-performers like Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar are rewarded, defeat to teams like Bangladesh are inevitable. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir Indian cricketers deserved to lose against Bangladesh. The first four batsmen scored just 32 runs, taking nearly 13 overs. Even Sourav Ganguly was not comfortable as he took 129 balls for his 66. One cannot understand why Virender Sehwag is being sent in as an opener again and again. He should be sent home instead. Sachin Tendulkar is not in form either, yet he talks of the next World Cup. Indians should turn away from cricket for a while if they want to send a message across. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir Rahul Dravid blamed the pitch for the Bangladesh shocker. It seems that Kapil Dev was right in predicting that this team will not win the World Cup. Instead, these players will come back with a cup of woes and excuses. 

 Yours faithfully,

H. Parasuram, Mumbai

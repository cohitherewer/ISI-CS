 CLUTTER ON THE FLOOR AND WALLS

 Soumitra Das

 Visual arts

 Although Aakriti art gallerys exhibition (May 5 to 15) of landscapes and contemporary Bengal sculpture in its two adjacent halls was more or less representative of current trends prevailing here, one wishes curator Prasanta Daw were more discriminating in presenting this mixed bag.

 The lyrical grace of Sarbari Roy Chowdhurys female figure and the monumentality of his tiny (8x5) reclining woman stood out in spite of their relatively small size. Madhab Bhattacharjees piece, made of transparent perspex with its triangles, rectangles and cylindrical shapes, appealed to ones sense of harmony. Sushen Ghoshs square void framed by a larger square of shining bronze with a pitted surface had the structured grace of a geometrical drawing. 

 In stark contrast, Sandip Chakrabortys bulbous fruit had the physicality of a tumescent organ. Sunil Kumar Dass Mangru was a perfect example of portraiture, while Bimal Kundus Barbie doll figure, in a leather dress perched on a tricycle, was a wry comment on times that are a-changing.

 Both Shyamal Roys crowing cockerel and Pankaj Panwars howling pie (picture) in terracotta had the vigour of rustic toys. Besides them, Niranjan Pradhans woman with an elongated torso encircled by birds and Ram Kumar Mannas Krishna looked stylized and ornamental, quite pointlessly. Anit Ghoshs Frozen Moment, made of aluminium sheet, had the poise of a bird taking wing, quite unlike Tarak Garais overwrought Durga and Gopal Prasad Mandals clumsy Flight of Peace. Perhaps it would have been a better idea to show more pieces by fewer artists instead of cluttering up the floor with single pieces by so many sculptors.

 Viewing would have been a more pleasant experience had there been a limited number of artists in the painting show, too. Some of the tiny watercolours by Ramananda Bandopadhyay and Gopal Ghosh shone like gems because of the ease with which they have, respectively, conjured up the great lake where the dark clouds and water become indistinguishable. Sad that there was a single painting by Manu Parekh. Anyway, it was difficult not to notice this painting charged with eroticism and its explosions of orange and red against a backdrop of black and blue.

 Kartick Chandra Pynes delicate watercolours on rice paper were remarkable for their tranquillity. The tiny strips of colour and spare lines barely spoke above a whisper.

 If viewers looked carefully they would have discovered the paintings of the well-known illustrator Purna Chandra Chakraborty and Indra Dugar, without whom no exhibition would have been complete at one time. There were also two works by Deviprosad Roychoudhury, one of them depicting an angler in eloquent black and white. So one is not a little shocked when confronted by the banality of Malay Chandan Saha. This was entirely avoidable.

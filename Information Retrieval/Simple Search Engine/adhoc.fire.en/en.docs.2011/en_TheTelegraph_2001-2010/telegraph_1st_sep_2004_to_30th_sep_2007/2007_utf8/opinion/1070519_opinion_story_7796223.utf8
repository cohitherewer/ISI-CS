 Loving dangerously

 Sir It seems that the opportunity to mix freely with the opposite sex is having an undesirable effect on boys and girls (Loveless triangle, May 17). Young lovers, far from being caring and dependable, are increasingly resorting to violence to settle matters of the heart. This, possibly, has to do with the fact that they are not mature enough to handle complex emotions. Consequently, they often end up harming their partners and even taking their own lives. Perhaps, counselling sessions would help youngsters survive a heart-break.

 Yours faithfully,

 Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Special treatment

 Sir A report filed by the comptroller and auditor general of India has revealed that the income tax authorities have given unfair exemptions on the foreign exchange earned by Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar (Taxing times for Sachin, Sunny, May 15). Tendulkar cleared a part of the outstanding payment, and also issued an appeal to the income-tax commissioner after the expos. Unfortunately, his action has come a bit late in the day. It is shocking to note that while cricketers are issued tax waivers, the salaried class is being deprived of such concessions. 

 In fact, such discrimination is not new. Earlier, the authorities had decided to waive customs duty on Tendulkars imported Ferrari. There were also reports of cash stashed in Gavaskars locker in the Bombay Gymkhana. India has always been a haven of corruption. Now, it seems that even cricketers are denying the exchequer its dues. Isnt it time the authorities ended such malpractices?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The CAG report tabled in parliament pulled up the income tax department for granting waivers to Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar. Subsequently, the chief commissioner of the IT department, Mumbai, issued a statement saying that the waivers were a mistake and corrective measures would be taken soon. However, the entire episode raises uncomfortable questions about the conduct of the IT officials. 

 The celebrities are never short of money. Yet, the tax sleuths have gone about offering sops to affluent members of our society. The government should look into this matter and take back all the honours that it heaped on the cricketers for their conduct in this matter.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Sorry, you are not artists, would have made a better headline for the report, Taxing times for Sachin, Sunny (May 15). At a time when real artists have come under attack from fundamentalist forces, the tax authorities decision to exempt these two cricketers on the ground that they were artists is simply preposterous. 

 One was under the impression that IT officials in India are an overzealous lot. However, this incident shows that this is not the case. It is surprising to note that the assessing officer went about his task without applying his mind or adhering to the existing rules. It would not be a bad idea for the government to instruct tax officers to go through their rule books once again.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir It is now an established fact that the IT department was biased while assessing the files of Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar. Indian cricketers earn a lot of money these days. Hence, the finance ministry must constitute a special cell to look into their earnings to ensure that there are no anomalies. Tendulkar, one hears, has made a part payment. However, he should be directed to cough up the entire amount as he has money to spare. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

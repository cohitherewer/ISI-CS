 AGAINST NATURE

 Why does an unmanageable number of Indians urinate and defecate in public places? Because some Indians mostly in the villages and urban slums have houses that have no toilets. And some, mainly in cities and towns, have no homes at all. Many in the first category, especially in rural India, have made a virtue out of this necessity, and believe that they actually prefer to answer the call of nature as naturally as possible. But for the homeless, particularly for women and children, it boils down to a stark absence of choice. All these realities and factors, geographically and sociologically so varied, will make it difficult for the Centre to achieve its target to end public defecation by 2012. (It seems to have forgotten about public urination altogether, but making it part of the campaign will make matters more difficult, for perfectly well-off city people will then have to be toilet-trained too.) 

 On the part of the State, it will not be enough to spend money on making toilets for homes and communities, or even to supplement this with programmes for behavioural change. The function and meaning of actual and not just ritual hygiene will have to be radically transformed across society. Most of India is used to filth and stench. Here waste disposal is still in its primitive stages, most of the public water is contaminated by rusty pipes or leaking sewers (there is arsenic in the water even in hospitals), and rivers are lethally dirtied by human waste. City-dwellers routinely walk past women delivering babies under flyovers, dogs feasting on discarded babies or sick people rotting quietly in garbage vats. So convincing people to change their habits of cleanliness for the sake of others will be a tough job here, to say the least. People keep themselves and their surroundings clean for two reasons. First, if they feel good about themselves, and second, if they feel that those they share public spaces with feel good about them too. Most of the homeless in India cannot imagine either. The transition from ritual purity to actual hygiene, or from policed hygiene to natural cleanliness, is not simply a matter of making toilets or imposing fines, although these would be steps in the right direction.

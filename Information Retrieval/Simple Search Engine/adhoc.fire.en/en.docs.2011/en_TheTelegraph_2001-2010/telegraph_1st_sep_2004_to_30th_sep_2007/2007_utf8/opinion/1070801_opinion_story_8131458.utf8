The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT A HERO

 Everybody makes mistakes. This is what Sanjay Dutt was told by the judge who has sentenced him to prison for six years. The judge was not trying to make Dutt feel better. On the contrary, he was putting the actor in place for wanting some more time to surrender after making the plea that he had made a mistake 14 years ago. The rule of law applies equally to everybody, and the judges rigour makes Dutt no exception. This, in spite of his offence being subjected to another order of judgment altogether that has little to do with the law. Dutt will appeal against the TADA-court judgment, but crucial example has already been set by the sentence, and this can only be a good thing in a country where popular heroes be they actors, gangsters or political leaders seem magically above the rule of law. The judge has sentenced Dutt and the others convicted with him for a chain of crimes. The phrase may be applied to a shameful number of powerful or popular Indians who have got away with a great deal simply by virtue of being powerful and popular. It has been said that any attempt to make state assemblies free of criminals would deprive some Indian states of legislators altogether.

 It is, therefore, particularly shocking that a Central minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, has declared in a press release with characteristic officiousness that all efforts ought to be made to enable Dutt get judicial relief. Mr Das Munshi believes in the judiciary but feels that Sanjay Dutt has already suffered enough. It is as if the courts of law have to compete with another kind of theatre that has the power to confound the judgments of not only the masses but also the leaders who rule them. A Lalu Prasad or Munnabhai can perform his way into evoking mirth or pity in the hearts of his audiences, so that the clown or martyr becomes a far more compelling figure than a convicted criminal. The rule of law must preserve its levelling realism against such a pervasive phenomenon. An AK-56 is no ordinary weapon. Although the law does not regard Dutt as a terrorist, he has been sentenced for an offence, the potential dangerousness of which makes him a criminal rather than a hero. It is the ability to distinguish between the two that makes somebody what the judge has rightly called a moral person.

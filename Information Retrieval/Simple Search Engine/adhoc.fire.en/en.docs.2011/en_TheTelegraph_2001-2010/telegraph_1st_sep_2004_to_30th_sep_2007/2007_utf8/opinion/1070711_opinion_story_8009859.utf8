 RULE THE WORLD 

 WORDCAGE

 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES

 Few men have done as much to shape 

 todays English as the brothers H.W. and F.G. Fowler. Their 

 The Kings English was first published 101 years 

 ago. Still more influential, A Dictionary of Modern English 

 Usage, by H.W. alone, came 20 years later. Both were 

 in print until the Nineties; in a new form, the latter still 

 is.

 The king in 1906 was Edward 

 VII. His United Kingdom still included all of Ireland, and 

 his empire, India part of it, was the widest that had ever 

 been. He knew more about game birds and other mens wives 

 than his native tongue, which he spoke with a heavy German 

 accent, derived from his father. Still, the kings English 

 British English was, and, except in the United States of 

 America, it set standards for the world. 

 How times have changed, and English 

 with them. Only massive revisions kept the Fowlers work 

 alive; the latest (1997) version of what is now known simply 

 as Fowlers Modern English Usage would better be 

 named after its editor, R.W. Burchfield, for years chief 

 editor of the great Oxford dictionaries. Yet the originals 

 are still worth reading. 

 Fowler can err, of course. The 

 Kings English included some 20 pages of dense and largely 

 useless scholasticism on shall and will. It 

 frothed, and the original Modern English Usage frothed 

 still more fiercely, against what it called the fused participle 

 in such phrases as a week passed without Mr Fairford 

 hearing from his son. That is a quotation from Walter 

 Scott; no matter, it should nay, must go Mr Fairfords 

 hearing, Fowler insisted; anything else violates the 

 plain rules of grammar.

 That was questionable even at 

 the time, as other grammarians pointed out. It is certainly 

 untrue now. Yet Fowlers advice is seldom as pedantic, and 

 most is still sound. He disliked split infinitives (as 

 in to boldly go), but made no big deal of them. He 

 was cautious of the late-Victorian preference for the Saxon 

 word over the one drawn from Latin. And he derided the fantasy 

 that a sentence must not end with a preposition (a myth, 

 as Churchill later mocked it, up with which I shall not 

 put).

 Good new English

 Fowler accepted American English, 

 in its place; what he condemned in vain was its injection 

 into British English, which he blamed, curiously, on Kipling. 

 Rightly, he felt it irrelevant that some Americanisms such 

 as I guess might come straight from Chaucer: Though 

 it is good old English, it is not [in British mouths] good 

 new English. Wrongly, in my eyes, he hadnt a word to say 

 for, or even about Americas elegant preservation of the 

 subjunctive (as in Jill insisted that Jack see a doctor), 

 which Britons were already giving up with his unlikely but 

 evident approval. New or antique, ugly or elegant like 

 fall for autumn Americanisms were for America, 

 let them stay there.

 Fowlers choice of American 

 words to dislike reads oddly today: placate, antagonize, 

 back number and standpoint were among them. 

 But his principle is one that many Britons still accept 

 equally vainly, as those and umpteen later words and usages 

 prove. Some of these are splendid, some ugly, some, such 

 as collateral damage, obfuscatory jargon. Some, such 

 as the random use of nouns as verbs, to me are barbarisms, 

 even if I myself employ them. But worldwide they have gone.

 Just as vain was Fowlers assertion 

 that the place of slang is in real life, not (except in 

 dialogue) in writing. These days, American slang especially 

 is barely born before it spreads to the media and soon to 

 literature.

 But thats language. It changes. 

 Not least of Fowlers charms is the snapshot he offers, 

 unconsciously, of a time when Britain, geopolitically, was 

 already in decline, but its educated elite could still believe 

 that their English, like their king, should, with a nod 

 to America, rule the world.

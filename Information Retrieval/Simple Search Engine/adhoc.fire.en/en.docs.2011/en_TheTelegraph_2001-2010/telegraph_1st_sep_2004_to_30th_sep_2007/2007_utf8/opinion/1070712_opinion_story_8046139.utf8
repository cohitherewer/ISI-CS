 THE GREAT GAMBLER

 Thanks to the Lal Masjid episode, the world now knows that Islamic militants were holed up in the heart of Pakistans capital, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Force to reckon with

 Islamabads Lal Masjid has been a favourite haunt of visiting journalists in recent years. You get the best quotable quotes from radicalized cleric-militants wielding AK-47 assault rifles, the women are shrouded in black from top to toe, which makes for great television pictures, and best of all, the mosque is in the heart of the beautifully-laid out Pakistani capital. Indian journalists need not despair that they cannot get visas for North or South Waziristan and other sundry tribal areas, made famous by fire-eating, tongue-lashing taliban hoods whose views make the Middle Ages look like a Diwali party. 

 Moreover, Lal Masjid is a stones throw from the Inter-Services Intelligence headquarters, just behind the Aabpara market. The day after Operation Silence, Pervez Musharrafs biggest gamble yet for the moderate soul of Pakistan, the Pakistani papers are full of the nexus between the Lal Masjid militants and the army headquarters in Rawalpindi (a seamless 25 kilometres away from Islamabad). 

 They knew all along, the Pakistani press is saying, pointing an accusing finger at Musharrafs establishment, so why did they not do anything about it earlier?

 And yet, there is more than a sneaking admiration for the Generals decision to storm the mosque and brutally end the siege, even if a hundred or so people (88 militants and 12 security personnel so far) have been killed in the bargain. Pakistan is still holding its breath, hoping no women or children have died. They know that if those corpses begin to emerge, then Musharraf can get ready to face a fate much worse than what can befall him with the death of Abdul Rashid Ghazi.

 The point is, the people of Pakistan mostly devout and largely believing that there was no alternative to partition and the two-nation theory in 1947 are frequently uncomfortable with fundamentalist brands of Islam. Since the born-again Islamization of Zia ul-Haq in the mid-Eighties (beards in the army and no women in the Pakistan foreign service, since reversed), it has all been downhill in one way. The truism that the triumvirate of Allah, Army and America continues to run Pakistan is, well, true.

 And yet, Musharrafs theory of enlightened moderation appeals to the people precisely because of their desperation to become a normal state. Holding innocent people hostage inside mosques blasphemes Islam. When Bhagwan Dass became Pakistans first Hindu acting chief justice, opening up a debate on whether a non-Muslim can head a major institution in an Islamic state, the Pakistani press savoured the story. The Iftekhar Chaudhury versus Musharraf case galvanized the country on Chaudhurys side. Raiding massage parlours and defying the writ of the State were roundly condemned as being against the rule of law.

 It is this constituency that Musharraf is appealing to, that he has largely won over with his gung-ho, larger-than-life, commando-type action since he overthrew Nawaz Sharif nine years ago. Ironically, though, as the power of this liberal middle class expands under Musharraf, it is they who will go for his jugular if he refuses to take his enlightenment to its logical conclusion, that is, by holding free and fair elections.

 The breed of Pakistan-watchers in India largely believes that Musharraf mostly plays fast and loose with India. That is, he stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the United States of America (naturally, since Bush amp; Co pump about $3 billion annually into Pakistan) and goes after the hard taliban in the northern areas with a vengeance, with a little help of course from the 45,000-odd US troops on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghan border.

 And yet, when it comes to taking action against the soft taliban, that is, representatives of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Toiba, and so on, Musharraf turns all coy, only saying that Pakistan provides moral, political and diplomatic support to freedom-fighters in Kashmir.

 Musharraf knows exactly what he is doing, earning points with the West as he supports the war against the taliban, at the same time turning a blind eye to militancy in India, analysts said. They admitted that Pakistan for many years had been able to get away with the freedom-fighters argument in Kashmir, precisely because of the Indian states human rights violations in the valley.

 And yet, on the eve of the Lal Masjid storming, Musharraf admitted that the Lashkar and the Jaish had infiltrated the mosque. Pakistan government sources, in the aftermath of the storming, said they were willing to give safe passage to chief militant-cleric, Abdul Rashid Ghazi, but that the talks broke down when Ghazi insisted that foreign militants inside the mosque also be given safe passage.

 For the moment at least, it seems as if Musharrafs great gamble on the Lal Masjid is paying off. George W. Bush himself, the morning after, has said, I like him, and I appreciate him. Manmohan Singh, who wished him godspeed last week in dealing with the Lal Masjid crisis, may be grateful that the world now knows that Lashkar-Jaish terrorists had holed themselves up in the heart of the Pakistani capital.

 To help transform Pakistan into a moderate state, on the lines of what Mohammed Ali Jinnah had once dreamt of who, by the way, has remade his entry in Pakistans school history books, courtesy Musharraf, having been banned during the Zia years will, of course, take much more. Cauterizing the Lal Masjid wound, along with the attendant blood and guts, can only be one part of that vision.

 In the end, is Operation Lal Masjid more Operation Bluestar or Operation Black Thunder? Bluestar was Indira Gandhis undoing, while Black Thunder, which flushed the militants out of the Harmandir Sahib in 1988, must count among one of Rajiv Gandhis unqualified successes.

 Always the commando, Musharrafs reported negotiations with Benazir Bhutto, to return to Pakistan and contest the forthcoming elections, could now complete his own transformation into a political player. If that happens, Musharraf would not only have planned his exit strategy himself. He would also have decided to quit while he is on top.

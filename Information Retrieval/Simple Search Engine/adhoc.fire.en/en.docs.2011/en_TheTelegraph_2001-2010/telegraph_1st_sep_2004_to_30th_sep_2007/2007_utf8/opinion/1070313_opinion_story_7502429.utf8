 Way out 

 Sir Andr Bteille (Pragmatism in politics, March 6) has correctly pointed out that caste politics is motivated both by ideological reasons and practical needs. It is undeniable that caste politics is also driven by a thirst for power. But Bteille is silent on the question whether such a trend is welcome or not. During the first few years after independence, caste politics was not prominent because the victims of the age-old caste system had expected the new rulers to strive for an egalitarian society by granting them their constitutional rights. Unfortunately, their hopes were belied. Their anger gave birth to the Kaka Kalelkar commission, Mandal commission and the latest Sachar commission, all of which recommended equitable treatment based on caste. Meanwhile, caste had become a useful tool in the hands of some upper-caste leaders to divide, rule and exploit the lower-castes. Now it is the turn of the downtrodden to wield the same weapon, not to cause harm to their oppressors but to liberate themselves. That liberation can only be achieved by influencing or occupying political power, ensuring adequate share and representation in education, employment, administration, wealth, judiciary and other areas of public life. This will gradually remould the social outlook and drive away caste-hatred. Today we do come across high-caste parents offering their daughters to low-caste civil servants or MBAs. Can we then not claim that the golden era of a casteless India is about to arrive? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Caste-based discrimination is a way of life in India. It is an inherent trait of one of the oldest civilizations in the world. I feel that caste should not be treated like apartheid. The caste question is not influenced by racist overtones. However, there is, undoubtedly, an immediate need to check the spread of such politics because such discrimination does not fit the image of a society that an economically-aspiring India has envisioned. 

 Change fosters change. So an attempt to address a specific section of society using reservations, religion, or culture leaving the other sections neglected, is bound to increase social chauvinism. It is necessary to carefully avoid stoking such discriminatory feelings. Unfortunately, politicians do not help the matter. They not only play caste politics, but also encourage the division of states. This in turn fosters a kind of negative regionalism. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Capital solution 

 Sir The Supreme Courts statement that the only way to root out dishonesty from the country is to hang the corrupt from the lamp post no doubt uses harsh language, but the motive of the judges is understandable (Judges want the corrupt hanged, March 8). Corruption in every sphere of life is weakening the nation. Even highly-placed officials, who have enough wealth, do not think twice before taking bribes. Perhaps the only way out is to met out the severest punishment to the guilty, as the Supreme Court judges indicate. However, given the fact that extreme measures cannot be implemented, a more practicable solution would be to refuse the payment of bribe to any government official and then to report him to higher authorities. If one or two greedy officers are sacked from their jobs then others of a similar mindset would think twice before getting their palms greased. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir An unnecessary uproar is being created over the comment of the apex court on corruption. The comment reflects the feelings of the common people. However, charity should begin at home and the Supreme Court should take strict steps to check corruption in the judicial system itself before venturing to control corruption in other government departments.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir There is hardly any need to take recourse to capital punishment to rid India of corruption. All that is required are speedy trials, rapid convictions and timely execution of sentences. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The apex courts statement should act as a warning to those who have freely exploited the law to their advantage. The law and order situation in India has deteriorated over the years due to the lackadaisical attitude of the judiciary, which seems in no hurry to resolve cases. Once the judiciary becomes active in dispensing justice, the situation would improve automatically as people will start respecting and fearing the law. 

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

 Sir The comments of the apex court bench on corruption are bold. It must be considered an expression of the judiciarys frustration at being hamstrung by the system in the smooth dispensation of justice. This is not surprising given that many of the laws inherited by the Indian democracy seem to have lost their relevance today. The existing laws have too many loopholes and can be manipulated easily. Which is why despite the enormous amount of money being siphoned off by politicians, there is no way they can be punished. Perhaps the only way to teach them a lesson now is to hang them. A few hangings would hardly deplete the ever-increasing population of India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

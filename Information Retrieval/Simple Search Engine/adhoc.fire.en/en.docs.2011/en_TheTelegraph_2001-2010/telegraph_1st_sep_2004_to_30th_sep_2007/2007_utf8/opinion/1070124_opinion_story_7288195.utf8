The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ETHNIC TAGS

 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES 

 Is it grossly offensive to be called the Indian, if you are one? Maybe. Paki plainly is, not least if you arent one. But to me the lesson of the Shilpa Shetty saga was that if, for a fat fee, you join a trash-TV show, thick with trash people, you can expect to be trashed. 

 Not the only lesson, though. We Christians, I wrote here two weeks ago. In my case, the word is strictly ethnic: I put my beliefs out to grass long since. Yet I belong to the Christian ethnos (which in ancient Greek simply meant tribe; and ethnic, in itself, carries no hint of race or Navajo beads). These broad ethnic tags are linguistic landmines, ever available for misuse. 

 Can one, for example, define a Hindu? Its been tried, but its like trying to catch a cloud in a net. Yet it can be a matter, literally, of life or death. In 1946 Calcutta, the Muslim mobs definition was the simplest: pull down his nether garments and look. Ditto, mutatis mutandis, for their Hindu rivals. 

 Or who is a Jew? Jews themselves have a simple definition: converts apart (about whom they fiercely disagree), the child of a Jewish mother. That merely throws the question back a generation. So? Someone who follows the rules and rituals of Judaism? Who calls himself a Jew? And is accepted by other Jews (like Maharashtras Bene Israel, who learned they were Jewish only 200-odd years ago, agreed, and were accepted by other Jews and eventually by the state of Israel)? Or is so defined by non-Jews? In Hitlers Gemany, one Jewish parent, or even grandparent, of either sex, could mean Auschwitz.

 Black or white?

 The fog gets foggier when religion is linked to region. If you proudly proclaim yours the Jewish state, you can hardly complain of anti-semitism (though you will) when a Palestinian mob shouts Kill the Jews. Or when region is linked to language. When a bomb goes off in Tel Aviv, its mob may shout Kill the Arabs a group, at root linguistic, that includes one Israeli in five.

 Who exactly is or is not Assamese? Or, in Spain, a Basque? Only people who speak Basque at home (as half in the Basque region dont)? Or who can get by in it (as most can)? Or all who live there? I imagine Ulfa and the Shiv Sena face similar conundrums.

 Wider regional epithets are no better. Most of us limit American to mean from the United States. Not so Latin Americans: north American, they insist, tacitly excluding Mexicans. Conversely, in past centuries, Europeans expanded Turkish to any kind of Mediterranean Muslim, much as Muslims used Rum, Rome, for all of Christian Europe. Many languages, American included, use English for any Briton. Just dont do it to a Scot. 

 To Americans, a European is anyone from Europe; to many Britons, from mainland Europe only; to many Indians, everyone with a white face whom 19th-century Americans (and some even now) knew as Caucasians. Britons talking of British Asians seldom include their ethnic Chinese. To many non-Africans, African means a black one only. Yet the most anti-black people in history were happy to be Afrikaners.

 Whatever white or black may mean, as anyone who has seen Colin Powell must ask. Yet, on those vaporous adjectives millions used to enjoy or be denied their rights in the southern United States and South Africa. Today, Britains anti-racist lobbies use black as a cover-all label; not always to the joy of wheat-coloured Punjabis thus covered.

 What todays huge migrations will do to such epithets, who knows? More confusion, for sure. I once visited a farm settlement in Brazil whose leaders, albeit of German de- scent, indeed German-speaking, were mostly Brazilian-born. How many are you? I asked. About 200, one replied. And then there are os brasileiros.

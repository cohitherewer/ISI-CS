 Faith healing

 Sir The Supreme Courts support of the expulsion of the 11 members of parliament implicated in the cash-for-questions scandal proves that no one is above the law of the land (Critics in house, BJP bows to bench, Jan 11). Such a precedent set by the highest court in the country is expected to reinforce the publics faith in the judicial system. The unscrupulous MPs belonged to major political parties, including the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. A great deal of political pressure must have been exercised in the case. But the apex court has stood firm to uphold justice in the most equitable manner. This should also warn other dubious political leaders about the consequences of their indiscretions. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir Now that the apex court has upheld the speakers decision to expel the MPs involved in the cash-for-query case, the courts attempt to limit the rights of the speaker must be reviewed. The speaker must exercise his prerogatives in running the House efficiently and in maintaining decorum. The apex court, however, has also made it clear that the legislatures activities, including its power to frame laws, is within the ambit of judicial review. This means that the court is empowered to declare any legislation null and void if it contravenes the basic tenets of the Constitution.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Following the apex courts decision to support the expulsion of the corrupt MPs, political parties will have to arrive at a consensus and pass a resolution to prevent unprincipled members from contesting forever. Given the dismal reputation of the politicians, many of whom are complicit in major scandals, the matter has to be dealt with strictly to decrease corruption in public life.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Supreme Courts verdict on the cash-for-questions case has made it clear that while the parliaments privileges cannot be questioned, its actions cannot remain outside the ambit of the law.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The editorial, Watching over(Jan 12), rightly concludes that the judiciary and the legislature need to serve as watchdogs together. While upholding the decision of parliament to remove the corrupt MPs, the Supreme Court has pointed to the adoption of a proper procedure in the matter. The judgment also points to the supremacy of the Constitution. But the very purpose of the expulsion of the MPs will be defeated if they are not convicted for corruption under the existing laws of the land. The MPs involvement in the scam merits a withdrawal of the perks and allowances they received during their tenure in the parliament. 

 Recently several politicians Shibu Soren and Navjot Singh Sidhu to name a few have been convicted in criminal offences. The time is right for the legislature to pass a law that terminates the membership of the tainted MPs. This new piece of legislation should be extended to disqualify all expelled MPs from contesting any election in the country again. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,

 Sir The recent Supreme Court verdict recognizing the power of parliament to expel corrupt members should further the dignity of the legislature. However, the judgment leaves plenty of scope for clashes between the parliament and the judiciary over the question of supremacy. This is mainly because the court has retained its right to look into the constitutional validity of such parliamentary actions to prevent the violation of fundamental rights. Even legislations falling under the Ninth Schedule have now been made subject to judicial review to check the possible misuse of power. 

 It must also be remembered that the two arms of the government need to complement each other. Instead of competing for more power, they must collabo- rate with one another to uphold the spirit of popular sovereignty enshrined in the basic structure of the Constitution. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Payel Sen, Calcutta

 Sir Avoiding conflict with the legislature, the apex court has upheld its right to comment on the decisions taken by the parliament. However, the Supreme Court should have also given its opinion on the Lok Sabha speakers refusal to accept its summons. 

 Moreover, since the expelled parliamentarians voluntarily decided to approach the courts, they should have been additionally convicted for corruption under the law of the land. They were exempted from any such conviction because their crime was covered up by the judicial immunity available to parliamentarians. For the complete eradication of the misdemeanours of politicians, the real remedy lies in abolishing this privilege.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal,

 Dariba, New Delhi

 Sir The apex court judgment will go a long way in disciplining our MPs who often abuse their position. Those involved in corrupt practices such as double-dealings should be punished like other ordinary citizens. 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

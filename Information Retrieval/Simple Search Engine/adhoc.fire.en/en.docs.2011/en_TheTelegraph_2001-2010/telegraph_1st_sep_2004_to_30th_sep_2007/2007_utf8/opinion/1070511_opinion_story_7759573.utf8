 KEEP IT PURE

 How can mathematics be modernized for Indian schools? And why? These questions, and their answers, lead directly to what basic education means to those who frame the syllabus. They also demand thinking through the entire problem of applications: how certain intellectual disciplines can be used to get on with the business of practical life. It is somewhat dismaying to see that important educationists in the city think that mathematics can be made more relevant to the contemporary lives of students by extending the subject to include, among other things, lessons in banking, tax calculation and share-market transaction. This seems to confuse certain basic principles of education, and this might have damaging consequences for young people, both intellectually and professionally.

 First, mathematics is neither numerology nor accountancy. Accountancy is a useful subject for some, and many of the new elements recommended for the mathematics syllabus deserve rather to be taught as part of the accountancy option. The crucial role of a mathematical education rests in the purity of the subject, and the demands that this element of abstraction makes on the intellect. Mathematics trains the mind to understand, explore and play with the concepts of, and relationships among, quantity, structure, space and change. This is done, at the most basic level, through operations involving numbers, but even at that level, losing sight of the purity of mathematics as an intellectual discipline comes at a very sad cost. And this is true not just for mathematics, but also for the other disciplines that seem to have fallen by the wayside of a modern and worldly education. Learning a classical language (or even a foreign one) is one such, where the skills inculcated are far more than simply linguistic. In that sense, Sanskrit or Latin is far from being a dead or exclusively theological language. But the discipline that the mind acquires from such a language is difficult to justify in terms of a certain understanding of modernity. To return to the first principles of education, and talk about teaching young people how to think, argue and write sharply and deeply, is not to make schooling elitist and cut off from the real world. To reduce the use of education to easy applicability is to forget the foundations of learning in the cultivation of the mind.

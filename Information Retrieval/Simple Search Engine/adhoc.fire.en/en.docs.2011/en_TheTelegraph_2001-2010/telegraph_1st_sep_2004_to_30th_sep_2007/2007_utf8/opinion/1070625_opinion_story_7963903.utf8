 ALL ABOUT GAS

 When Reliance discovered seven trillion cubic feet of gas in the Krishna-Godavari basin five years ago, Ram Naik, the then petroleum minister, had claimed that the find would go a long way towards changing perceptions about the hydrocarbon potential of India. The proven reserves have gone up to 14 trillion cubic feet, but the prospects of Reliance being able to exploit these huge reserves have receded inexorably. The final blow was dealt by the Bombay high court when it restrained Reliance last week from selling the gas to anyone except National Thermal Power Corporation and Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Limited till 2016. The litigation that led to this disastrous outcome for Reliance has two roots. One is the bitter quarrel that broke out between the Ambani brothers over their patrimony. The other goes back to the companys frantic efforts in 2002 to find a market for the gas. It offered the gas to NTPC at the best price it could get then; the rest it proposed to use in a 5.5 GW power plant to be set up in Uttar Pradesh. The power project went to Mr Anil Ambani under the brothers separation agreement. The price Reliance can get today for its gas is almost twice the price at which it had agreed to sell the gas to NTPC as well as to the plant in Dadri. Mukesh Ambani had hoped to renege on the commitments to NTPC and Dadri, and invited offers for the gas from other potential buyers. The Bombay high court has put paid to his manoeuvres.

 It is extraordinary how badly Mr Mukesh Ambani, who is otherwise an extremely astute businessman, has managed his relations with his brother. First, he got into a prolonged dispute over the division of the inheritance, and, in the process, did enormous damage to the Reliance brand. Then he refused to compromise, and finally had to agree to arbitration. He ended up losing half of the Reliance empire. Now he has managed to reduce the realization from his gas reserves by just about $1 billion over the next eight years. Anyone who went by the results alone would rate Mr Mukesh Ambani one of Indias worst businessmen.

 The high court has left him one line of escape, namely that he can use the gas himself. He will be tempted to go into power production himself. But that would be compounding his folly. The market for electricity is entirely monopolized by bankrupt government-owned electricity boards; so he cannot get a better price by using the gas himself. It makes good business sense for him, even at this late stage, to make common cause with Mr Anil Ambani. The Dadri power plant does not make much sense either; but abandoning it has to be Mr Anil Ambanis decision, not Mr Mukesh Ambanis. The law has turned the two brothers into Siamese twins; they have no choice but to be nice to each other.

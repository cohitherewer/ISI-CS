The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 GENTLEMEN MUSTNT UTTER THE M WORD 

 - It is absurd to see cricketers joining the ICL being squeamish 

 about money

 TAKING GUARD

 Inzamam-ul Haq is supposedly the 

 first Pakistan cricketer to have said yes to the lucrative 

 offer to play in the Indian Cricket League. Inzamam went 

 about signing the deal quietly. He simply called up his 

 father from England (the former Pakistan captain is currently 

 playing for Yorkshire) and let him know about his decision. 

 This was typical Inzamam taciturn, untroubled and at peace 

 with himself. There were no stormy meetings with PCB officials. 

 He did not even respond to the PCB chairmans threat that 

 Pakistani players joining the ICL would not be considered 

 for selection in the national team. He also turned a deaf 

 ear to angry whispers that for all his religiosity he still 

 craved the good life. (Inzamam, along with some of his teammates 

 was a member of the Tablighi Jamaat, a Muslim revivalist 

 movement.) His reaction to all the mudslinging was brief, 

 and honest. Inzamam said that he was happy to join the ICL 

 as it would give him an opportunity to stay in touch with 

 the game and make good money. 

 Inzamam has been the only Pakistani 

 player to acknowledge the fact that money played a part 

 in his decision. And it is this honesty that has set him 

 apart from three of his countrymen who have opted for the 

 league in India. A hurt and disappointed Abdul Razzak 

 quit international cricket in protest after the selectors 

 dropped him from the Pakistan squad for the forthcoming 

 Twenty-20 tournament in South Africa. Of course, he did 

 not have to sulk for long. The headhunters at the ICL made 

 him a profitable offer, and he promptly signed on the dotted 

 line. Two other discards, Mohammed Yousuf and Imran Farhat, 

 resented their omissions and joined the ICL bandwagon as 

 well. Money, they said, was not the issue here, it was wounded 

 pride. It is another matter that Razzak, Yousuf and Farhat 

 chose not to sign the newly- revised monthly retainers of 

 Rs 250,000, Rs 150,000 and Rs 100,000 that were offered 

 by the PCB. Considering the ICLs deep pockets, it is difficult 

 to believe that the trio will play for less in India. 

 Cricketers in denial of the M-word 

 can be found on this side of the border too. Deep Dasgupta, 

 who joined the ICL along with six other players from Bengal, 

 has gone to great lengths to explain that his joining the 

 rebel league should not be seen as a captain letting down 

 his state team. He was quitting because the ICL (with a 

 handful of ageing, international stars and the also-rans 

 in Indian cricket) was supposedly more competitive than 

 domestic tournaments. What Laxmi Ratan Shukla did was even 

 more comical. He travelled to Mumbai, took part in a parade 

 featuring the players in the league, all the time bargaining 

 hard to strike a good deal. His unhappiness over certain 

 clauses in the ICL contract made him return and declare 

 that his heart was still with Bengal. 

 It is absurd to see cricketers 

 joining the ICL being squeamish about money. All the more 

 so because, with the professionalization of cricket, the 

 players have become modern-day mercenaries. They are justified 

 in demanding, and receiving, princely sums if they can command 

 a price.

 Thankfully, Inzamam remains an 

 exception, just as he was during much of his career a 

 burly, indolent man among a bunch of temperamental youngsters.

 The murder of trust

 Sir Affluent people in urban India cannot imagine a life without domestic helps. At the same time, it is impossible, in most cases, to check the credentials or the antecedents of domestic helps, many of whom are migrant workers who come in search for work from other districts. However, the fact that Neekar Yadav had been serving the Luthras for seven long years must have been enough for his employers to place their complete trust in him (Help turns high-rise hunter, Feb 16). Yadavs killing of Ravinder Kaur Luthra in cold blood is all the more shocking because of the breach of trust on the part of a man who had been living in the care of his employers for a long time. Every employer would now think twice before trusting his or her domestic help. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The brutal murder of Ravinder Kaur Luthra by her domestic help of seven years, Neekar Yadav, forces one to reflect upon the rapid erosion of values in human relationships in recent years. The servant-master relationship has always been based on trust. But old-world values such as honesty and reliability have no place in todays changing society. Under the circumstances, it is imperative that employers get their domestic helps registered with the police. The employers need to take certain precautions so that they do not fall prey to the schemes of their servants. One must remember that most of the domestic helps come from poor backgrounds. Hence, it is natural for them to succumb to greed if they see wealth lying around. It is possible that Yadavs real intention was to lay his hands on the money and the jewellery in his employers household. The murder could have been averted if the Luthras had been a little more careful with their assets. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir The way Neekar Yadav murdered Ravinder Kaur Luthra proves that he is only a petty criminal who had murdered for money. It is not unusual for men in Yadavs position to do what he has done. His second marriage to another domestic help must have increased his need for money and forced him to plan the murder of the woman when her husband was away. Unfortunately for him, the alibi that he thought of to cover his tracks was not good enough and he got caught.Yadavs act proves once again the extent to which a man would go when lured by the prospect of money. 

 Yours faithfully,

Soma Datta, Siliguri

 Sir There is no doubt about the fact that the murder of Ravinder Kaur Luthra is a tragic incident. But one wonders if the media would have been interested in the case if a woman, who was not in Luthras social position, had been done away with in a similar manner. Ordinary citizens are often turned away by the police when they go to seek help. Yet, in this case, the police commissioner made sure that he personally visited the Luthra residence after the tragedy. Such differential treatment sticks out in a country that calls itself a democracy. Moreover, the comment that all of Calcutta knows the Luthras sounds a bit far-fetched. The Luthras must have been well-known among the rich and the famous, but hardly any Calcuttan outside that circle could have known her. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Bridge for peace

 Sir The resolution of the dispute over the Baglihar dams construction on the river Chenab should be welcome news for both India and Pakistan (All-clear for Baglihar, only 1.5 m less, Feb 13 and Flowing again, Feb 16). The building of the dam, which would generate 450 MW of hydel power, was stalled 16 years ago when Pakistan objected to its design, citing the Indus Water Treaty of 1960. Pakistan had sought the intervention of the World Bank over the issue and the Bank had appointed Raymond Lafitte as the neutral arbitrator. It is good that Lafittes verdict has been accepted wholeheartedly by both parties. One hopes that the dam, which had long been a thorn in the flesh for the two neighbours, will now turn into a bridge of goodwill and understanding. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pronab Kumar Haldar, Calcutta

 Sir Since both India and Pakistan are happy over the verdict delivered in the case of the Baglihar dam, it is now safe to assume that the issue stands resolved. One expects more such diplomatic solutions to contentious matters between India and Pakistan in the near future. This would not only help build trust among the people of both countries but also bring back peace to the borders that have witnessed a lot of bloodshed.

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

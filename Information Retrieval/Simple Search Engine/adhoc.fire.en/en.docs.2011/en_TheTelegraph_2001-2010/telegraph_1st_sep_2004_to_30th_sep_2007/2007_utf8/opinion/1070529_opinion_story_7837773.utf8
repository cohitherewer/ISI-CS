 A MINATORY 

 MIND 

 - The prime ministers commandments to industrialists 

 WRITING ON THE WALL

 ASHOK V. DESAI

 The prime minister, in his annual 

 sermon to the Confederation of Indian Industry, handed out 

 ten commandments to industrialists. Industrialists are polite 

 even when they are not obsequious, so they will not rebut 

 him. But he should be answered.

 The state makes money without 

 having to earn it; it takes money away from people by force. 

 It is difficult for anyone to live on unearned income unless 

 he can reassure himself that he is doing some good unrelated 

 to his take. Monarchs used to harbour illusions that the 

 kingdom was bestowed on them by heaven. Conquerors and occupiers 

 by force believe that they have saved their territories 

 from worse rulers. Pervez Musharraf illustrates this illusion 

 well. Elected rulers forget how accidental the results of 

 most elections are. They like to believe that they are specially 

 beloved of, and morally obliged to promote the interests 

 of, the people who elected them; in a competitive system 

 they also want to shower favours on people at others cost 

 who they hope would elect them next time. The combination 

 of power and illusion has led rulers unduly and unnecessarily 

 to interfere in the lives of people, most often with good 

 intentions. In his 40-year career, the prime minister has 

 risen from the ranks to the top of the men and women who 

 rule India. On the way, he picked up the rulers disease. 

 The prime minister preached: The time has come for the 

 better-off sections of our society not just in organized 

 industry but in all walks of life to understand the need 

 to make our growth process more inclusive; to eschew conspicuous 

 consumption; to save more and waste less; to care for those 

 who are less privileged and less well off; to be role models 

 of probity, moderation and charity.

 As others fall in love with beautiful 

 women, the prime minister falls in love with beautiful phrases. 

 For some years his favourite phrase was development with 

 a human face; then he changed over to inclusive growth. 

 These are only the latest euphemisms for income redistribution. 

 Politicians across the world love redistribution. It serves 

 their interests, for the poor are more numerous and have 

 more votes than the rich.

 Let us assume that redistribution 

 is good. What behavioural rule does that belief enjoin? 

 If being rich is reprehensible, then everyone should stay 

 poor. If all believe and practise this, a society will remain 

 poor. But that would not suit the prime minister, for he 

 thinks poverty is a curse. Such a belief would give rise 

 to the behavioural rule that everyone should receive the 

 same income (adjusted for age, family size and personal 

 needs) regardless of merit. In other words, the prime minister 

 should be a communist: he should believe in the rule, From 

 each according to ability, to each according to need. But 

 that also does not suit him. After being witness to the 

 self-destruction of the Soviet Union, one has to be an extreme 

 idealist, not to say unrealist, to believe in compulsory 

 equality. 

 And then, having once been a brilliant 

 economist, the prime minister remembers the importance of 

 incentives: he must believe that the lure of riches drives 

 people to greater enterprise and effort. So he has come 

 to the Gandhian view that the rich should work their asses 

 off to get richer, but must not flaunt their riches, and 

 should give away much of it to the poor. Would that be better 

 than if they saved and invested in new productive facilities? 

 Manmohan Singh has read Keynes closely, but he has got him 

 wrong. Victorian businessmen lived modestly, not so much 

 because they believed in modest living, but because the 

 profits of reinvesting their savings were too tempting. 

 The new rich of the 19th centurypreferred the power which 

 investment gave them to the pleasures of immediate consumption.

 Are the Indian rich of today any 

 different? Do they indulge in conspicuous consumption? The 

 prime minister held his economic policies responsible for 

 the fact that the savings ratio had risen from 32 to 35 

 per cent. That is an awful lot of savings, whether in historical 

 or in internationally comparative terms; and those savings 

 are mostly of those whom the prime minister would consider 

 rich. They save so much for the same reason as their Victorian 

 counterparts that they face irresistible opportunities 

 of profit.

 This is not to deny the signs 

 of conspicuous consumption at which the prime minister raised 

 his eyebrow clogged airports, new holiday destinations, 

 the real estate boom. But he mistakes changing patterns 

 of consumption for conspicuous consumption. Earlier, people 

 used to take a train to a holiday destination; the trains 

 were as packed then as planes now. Now that the monopoly 

 of Indian Airlines is broken, air fares have plummeted, 

 and airlines have clogged airports because the government 

 has under-invested in airports. People are going abroad 

 on holidays now because of relaxation of exchange control. 

 If they went earlier to Kerala, they go now to Malaysia 

 because Malaysia is cheaper. Since Indias population 

 is growing so fast, houses are bound to be constructed. 

 Once they would have been extra floors on urban houses; 

 now they are high-rise housing estates because the technology 

 involved has been imported. The prime minister sees conspicuous 

 consumption because he disapproves of what he sees. When 

 I think of conspicuous consumption, I think of whoring, 

 drinking, fast cars. I see little of it in India.

 And most of those consumers he 

 frowns on are yuppies the new working class, not the old 

 moneybags. For the boom has created a labour shortage for 

 the first time in Indias history not everywhere, but 

 fairly widespread. For the first time again, kids in their 

 twenties earn more than wise old men like the prime minister.

 Still, if the prime minister is 

 worried that the poor will riot in a fit of jealousy and 

 start killing the rich, his fear must be taken seriously. 

 After all, he is in a position of power where he comes to 

 know all sorts of things that we would not. I do see a rise 

 in unrest and violence in the country. But I do not see 

 how they are related to the rich and the poor. If Akalis 

 attack Sacha Saudagars, if the government of West Bengal 

 kills people in Nandigram, if the Bajrang Dal hounds Muslims, 

 that is not class conflict. If there is any pattern in these 

 events at all, it is the cowardice of Indian governments 

 against collective violence.

 Finally, let me come to the prime 

 ministers admonition to industry to become socially responsible. 

 It should certainly try its hand at it, but only on the 

 condition that the government gets out of the way. The government 

 spends enormous amounts on health, education, environment, 

 employment and so on. These are traditional areas in which 

 it has spent an enormous amount since independence; and 

 it has little to show for it. It should hand over the money 

 it spends on these programmes to the private sector under 

 conditional subsidy or incentive programmes; it will see 

 the difference in a short time. But if it does so, what 

 will the bureaucrats and politicians fatten themselves on?

 Letters to Editor

 Slow to change 

 Sir Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article, Habits die hard (March 10), was as humourous as it was thought-provoking. Culture is a product of multifarious factors. The defining characteristics of a particular culture build up over thousands of years, incorporating the varied, and sometimes conflicting, features of the ethnic groups that compose it. Since geographical and historical conditions are inextricably linked with a nations culture, its defining attributes refuse to change merely with social transformation. External compulsions might influence these pecularities, but they cannot efface them. Attempts to change the cultural traits of a nation sometimes produces ridiculous effects, as in the case of the Balinese women. They can also result in threatening confusion. That is why it is better not to introduce any sudden or violent change in society .

 Yours faithfully,

Narayan Das, Calcutta

 Sir The question that inevitably comes up on reading Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article is whether individuals change before society does, or is it the opposite? One feels ashamed to admit that most of the lifestyle habits mentioned by Datta-Ray, like spitting or urinating in public places, have become an integral part of the Indian culture. The way out of the problem posed by uncivil customs, as suggested by Dutta-Ray, is not quite clear. He says at one point that each society must work out the methods to which its people respond best, and says later that individuals must change before society does. One also wonders why Lee Kuan Yew should be saddened by the absence of books or paintings in the apartments of the Singaporeans who had exchanged slums for spanking new government flats. All classes of people cannot be assumed to be interested in books. If Yew expects to be greeted by rows of bookshelves in every home he visits, then he too seems to be in the grip of an old habit that refuses to die. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir One never knows what would make people renounce certain habits or customs. The Indian governments endeavour to stop smoking or spitting in public is laudable but it is hard to predict whether it will work. It is unlikely that people will use a spittoon when they can spit freely wherever they please. The only measure that might work is a combination of punishment and reward. 

 Yours faithfully,

Akasmika Rath, Bhubaneswar

 Crown that does not fit

 Crown princess

Sir The efforts to anoint Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudis daughter, Saba Ali Khan, as the mutawalli or chief trustee of shrines and royal properties in Bhopal, is inappropriate (A crown beckons a princess, March 7). Since India is a democracy, the daughter of a former nawab cannot hold a post simply by virtue of her lineage. If her status as a princess is discounted, what qualification does Saba have to justify the religious authority that will be vested in her? 

 And if Pataudi believes that his choice of Saba over her siblings is going to enhance his image as a good Muslim, then he should think twice. Pataudis image took a severe beating when he allegedly killed endangered animals. Avoiding male gatherings, as is required of women holding religious office in Bhopal, would also not prove the religiosity of Saba overnight. 

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Gupta, Hooghly 

 Sir It seems that Saba Ali Khan is being appointed the mutawalli primarily in order to ensure that the erstwhile nawabs of Bhopal, the Pataudis, retain their hold over the vast ancestral property. This seems more so since Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi had recently been engaged in property disputes with his close relatives. In keeping with the democratic Constitution of India, it would only be fair if the Auqaf-e-Shahi is merged with the state-run waqf board.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Money matters

 Sir The report, No name, so no chance to live (March 6) was heart-rending. It is shameful that the ailing woman got no attention from the doctors of the state general hospital in Nabadwip just because she was a vagrant. She died after lying unattended for ten days. All the doctors who refused to see to her needs must be held responsible for her demise. She could have survived had she received treatment and medicines in time. The doctors have proved themselves to be less than human beings by their callousness. Perhaps they also need to see a doctor who will check their mental health.

 Yours faithfully,

Waeza Tazien, Calcutta

 Sir As citizens of a democratic country, each Indian possesses the fundamental right to live, irrespective of his or her financial status. Unfortunately, none seems to believe that the poor too have a right to life. Otherwise, the doctors of the state hospital would not have let the nameless woman die a prolonged and agonizing death right under their nose. 

 What is even more despairing is that nobody other than Deeepak Sarkar, who runs a tea stall at the hospital, cared to give the starving woman food. The indifference of the public is shocking. Whatever ideals of love or charity we may profess, the bottomline is that none will help those who have no money. The headline of the report should have read, No money, so no right to live. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

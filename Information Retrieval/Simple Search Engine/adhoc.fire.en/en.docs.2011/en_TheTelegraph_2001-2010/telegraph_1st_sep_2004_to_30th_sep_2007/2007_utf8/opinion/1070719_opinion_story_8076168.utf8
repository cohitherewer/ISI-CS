 NO ESCAPE

 What is happening to Bengals Bright Young Things? Fewer students are going up to the Indian Institutes of Technology and of Management from the Bengal region. For the IITs, the number of successful candidates per hundred writing the entrance test is also a great deal lower in the Bengal zone than in the others. There are several ways in which this trend can be interpreted. There is a narrow view of the situation that looks at the immediate factors: decline in preparatory courses, inability to manage the board and entrance examinations together, students migrating to other parts of the country. Each factor is dismal in its own way, indicating general tendencies that hinder competitiveness. But perhaps a wider and deeper view is necessary, and one that might not be more reassuring.

 Is education steadily being reduced to the pursuit of mediocrity in Bengal at a fundamental level? This possibility will have to be looked in the face instead of buffering the enquiry with superficial, and largely trivial, answers. Right from the primary level, an education system hindered at every level by state control is bound to produce, in the long run, rather depressing results. Take, for instance, the long and disastrous experiment with English language teaching. The many theories of bilingual education tried out by the government have produced, over the decades, severely disadvantaged students, badly trained teachers and a deeply divided bunch of school-leavers in terms of opportunities in the open field of higher education. Add to that the inept handling of the sheer numbers sitting the board examinations the levelling of all standards of excellence by lopsided notions of the democratization of higher education. Any attempt to modernize syllabi, pedagogy or infrastructure gets caught up in a politicized bureaucracy that fosters an aversion to change and radical reform. In such an ambience, an emphasis on career and examination-oriented teaching and learning can only breed a kind of risk-averse utilitarianism in students, teachers, administrators and policy-makers that can only accelerate the descent into mediocrity. The debate over the granting of autonomy to Presidency College only reinforces such a bleak view of things. The escape-route to excellence afforded by the IITs and IIMs might end up being the only hope for those who manage to rise above this grim scenario.

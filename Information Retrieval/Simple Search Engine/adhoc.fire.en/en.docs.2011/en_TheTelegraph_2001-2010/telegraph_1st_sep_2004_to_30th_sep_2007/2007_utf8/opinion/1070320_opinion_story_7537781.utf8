 RAVES AND RANTS

 Malvika Singh

 MALA FIDE 

 It is because a bunch of young people were doing drugs at a rave that the law enforcement authorities have begun to damn all parties. For the police patrols, any and every party hereon, even without drugs, will now be seen as something wrong.

 This is stupid. We all know how many amongst those mandated to enforce the law are in cahoots with those who break the law. The fees paid by defaulters to get away vary, depending on the city and the crime. The entire spectrum of the leadership and each administrator know this truth, but choose to turn a blind eye to it. The public has become immune to this widespread corruption and has learned how to cope. We also know that the few who stand up and expose the lie are not spared for speaking out. Threats, income tax queries, raids and suchlike are brought into play to harass and make life miserable for them.

 Does the average policeman understand the diverse life patterns, styles and norms of the many layers and levels of Indian society, its rural sensibilities, small-town aspirations, and the many truths and realities of its metropolitan life? Many in the force are deeply conservative, while others are fundamentally parochial, inexperienced and ill-informed about changing social norms, mores and values that come with liberalism. Lets face it there is a problem of class as there is of caste, but no one talks about it. It is deemed politically-incorrect to raise the issue.

 A farce staged

 Why not party, and party hard? Why not listen to and absorb music of all description and type? If we want to dance all night, no one should have the authority to stop us. All this as long as no rules or laws are broken. The police must, therefore, be able to distinguish one reality from another that may, on the surface, appear to be the same. 

 Such obvious prejudices on the part of the police against some people and certain activities are detrimental to society. They are also responsible for fanatical positions that warranted the attack on painter M.F. Husain. The assault on him for painting representations of gods and goddesses in the nude was a farce. And to think that nobody in the political establishment was willing to damn this outrageous attack, is even more frightening. Freedom is a fragile gift that our forefathers fought for. Our Constitution ratified those freedoms for future generations. Let us not mutilate those freedoms.

 Frayed morals

 Surely, the law-enforcing agencies of government need to first purge themselves of all corrupt practices, liberate themselves from associations and commitments to the underworld and criminals of all description, and learn to separate the right from the wrong. They need to rebuild their forgotten work ethic, their frayed morality and personal integrity. They need to restore faith and trust in the minds of ordinary Indians across the economic scale. Today, unfortunately, nobody trusts the authorities. Imagine having to constantly point out that the prime minister is an honest man! This single utterance tells the story of a degraded administrative and political structure.

 Everyone in power, ensconced in the exalted corridors of the ministries concerned, knows this truth well. No one wants to upset the apple cart. Therefore, attack a party, a rave, and make sure you thereby damn all parties, making entertainment and open fun suspect, and use the press to manipulate the definition of parties and raves, so that all parties can be damned. Do some token interventions and forget about the real issues. Allow the real criminals to go scot-free at the cost of the majority of the innocent out for a clean, good time. Excellent fodder for the narrow-minded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PLAYING IT AGAIN

 Everything must stop in Bengal when politicians want to play. No matter what it costs students and their parents, even public examinations have to wait to make room for political games. Fridays bandh call shows yet again how the states insensitive politicians hold public life to ransom. If a blundering government chose to trigger the tragedy in Nandigram on the eve of the examinations, the opposition did no better by calling the bandh on the day on which the tests were to start. Usually, Bengals politicians would keep public examinations outside the purview of bandhs. One can no longer hope for such small mercies. There is absolutely no doubt that the brutal police action in Nandigram needs to be condemned. Opposition parties have a moral and political obligation to mobilize public opinion against the governments action. Instead of doing any such thing, the sponsors of the bandh will probably end up alienating the people from their cause. The stalling of the examinations is not the only reason for public anger; bandhs have come to mean partisan muscle-flexing that serves no public purpose.

 However, the greater danger is that the bandhs symbolize Bengals politics of terror. The forcible shutdown of workplaces, transport and everything else is a complete rejection of democratic choices. All this is done in the name of the people who feel utterly helpless to defy the politicians diktat. Ms Mamata Banerjee, who is the chief sponsor of Fridays bandh, had several options to protest against the gruesome events in Nandigram. The state assembly is in session and the legislators of her party could have used the forum for their purpose. Protest meetings could have been organized at different levels. Obviously, she has as little faith in democratic dialogue as the Marxist government. With politicians like these, a resurgent Bengal may be a far cry.

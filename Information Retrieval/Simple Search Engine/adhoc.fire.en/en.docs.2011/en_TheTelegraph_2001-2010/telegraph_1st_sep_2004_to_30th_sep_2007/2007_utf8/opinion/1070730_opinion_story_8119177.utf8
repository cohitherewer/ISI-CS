 RISE AND SHINE 

 - Urban, industrial and commercial India since 1991 

 COMMENTARAO 

 S.L. RAO

 Surprising revivals 

 A Kumbhakarna waking in India 

 after sleeping since 1991, would have rubbed his eyes in 

 disbelief. In the shops are apples from Fiji and China, 

 Swiss chocolates, almost all the latest models of cars, 

 cell phones, television, hi-fi equipment, and many consumer 

 products including designer clothes, bags and other such 

 luxuries. Most urban middle-class young men and women go 

 to work, earning good salaries. So do the young from lower 

 socio-economic strata with little education, in malls, multiplexes, 

 fast food restaurants, supermarkets and hotels.

 Housing loans at 10 per cent interest, 

 the Sensex at 15,000 and rising, over $200 billion of foreign 

 exchange reserves, the rupee rising every day in relation 

 to the dollar and even other currencies, Indians welcomed 

 as immigrants in most developed countries, India labelled 

 as the new superpower of this century and sharply declining 

 poverty levels make India a different country from what 

 it was in 1991.

 The rich and the middle classes 

 are very much better off. But the over-fifty-fives of 1991 

 are now dependent on the generosity of their prosperous 

 children because their savings are too small for the new 

 higher prices of almost everything. The unorganized sector 

 has more employment than before, but incomes remain low 

 while agriculture has become an uncertain occupation for 

 the many small land-owners.

 Many industrialists in 1991 did 

 not recognize that India had joined the world and would 

 never again be an insular economy. Our opening the economy 

 coincided with the revolution in telecommunications, information 

 technology, travel and the growing shortage in the developed 

 countries of people and of skills at affordable costs. Those 

 Indian businesses that did not seize the new opportunities 

 died or disappeared. There were many who did change and 

 developed significant businesses. Some of them became the 

 new barons of the Indian and the world economies.

 Most knights of the level playing 

 field led by Rahul Bajaj later joined the race to take 

 advantage of the new situation. Bajaj, for example, handed 

 over to his sons, who spent some of the large cash reserves 

 on brand building, research and development, new production 

 facilities and new professional managers. Fortunate ones 

 like the Parle soft-drink clan, Balsara, MTR and many others 

 found buyers and sold out. The swadeshi-ites led 

 by the physicist-politician, Murli Manohar Joshi, had demanded 

 preference to the indigenous over the foreign and coined 

 the memorable phrase, Yes to computer chips but no to potato 

 chips, shorthand for foreign investment only in high-technology 

 areas. He and his supporters were silenced by Indias leadership 

 in the IT revolution, the businesses it spawned and the 

 new global reach of Indian business and human talent. Joshis 

 disciples remain in government and outside and oppose foreign 

 investment in, say, telecom and retailing. The sleazy underbelly 

 of government, by innovating shady schemes that are mostly 

 real estate scams like the special economic zones, give 

 the Joshi disciples more ammunition.

 The state-owned enterprises are 

 the missing guests at this prosperous table. Their control 

 by government bureaucrats, appointment of CEOs who are government 

 officers, interference in investment decisions and limits 

 on pricing freedom are some ways in which their prosperity 

 has been hindered. An example of control was in the recent 

 ONGC saga, first with the attempt to put the regulator of 

 exploration, the director-general, Hydrocarbons, on the 

 board, and then the humiliating treatment of the succeeding 

 chairman selected by a neutral panel, initially giving him 

 acting charge and then confirming him after a year. The 

 appointment of IAS officers to run the newly merged national 

 carriers is a guarantee (from past experience) that this 

 sensible move and its long-awaited investment in new planes 

 will fail. The bold investment plans of BSNL have been stymied 

 by a new minister who overruled his knowledgeable predecessor 

 for unknown reasons. The oil-marketing companies have lost 

 large sums because government does not want to allow higher 

 prices for petroleum products so as to counter inflation, 

 nor to add to its deficits by directly meeting the shortfall.

 However, the nationalized banks 

 have so improved that they now pose real competition to 

 foreign and private banks. So have the insurance companies. 

 BSNL has retained its No. 1 position despite intense competition. 

 BHEL has shown good profits, but government ownership has 

 induced a timidity that is now leading to shortages of power 

 plants. Single-product companies like NTPC or Power Grid 

 cannot, because of government ownership, get into related 

 diversification.

 There have been many surprising 

 revivals. In the late Eighties, the UB group was a conglomerate 

 with control over its original and successful liquor business, 

 Best amp; Crompton, a dying engineering company, an unprofitable 

 Hindustan Polymer, a polyester-maker, poorly run Mangalore 

 Refinery, Berger Paints, and a pharmaceutical company. Today 

 it is highly focused; the second largest liquor company 

 in the world with foreign brands owned by it, and No. 2 

 in the airline business in India. The rest were divested. 

 So has Parry developed a narrow focus and become very successful 

 in fertilizers and houseware. Sanmar, a Madras group, has 

 similarly focused its business much more on its core chemicals 

 and plastics. TATA has become a global company, as have 

 the Aditya Birla group, Bharat Forge and many others. Even 

 a small company like RAIN Calcining is now the largest in 

 the world in calcined petroleum coke through organic growth 

 and overseas acquisition. Indian companies have displaced 

 multinationals in India in the pharmaceutical industry. 

 Stories in foreign business magazines 

 and books about strategies, buyouts, compensation and so 

 on are no longer merely interesting reading. They are also 

 about our companies as they grow, globalize and become more 

 competitive. Where the maximum salary allowed by the registrar 

 of companies for a CEO was Rs 90,000 a year, now the same 

 company pays in crores apart from stock options and commissions, 

 not only to the MD but also to the other top executives. 

 But not in public sector enterprises.

 Before 1991, the circumstances 

 and challenges were different. The economy was protected 

 and licensing ruled all management decisions. Foreign partners, 

 imported technology and legal consumer-goods imports were 

 all ruled by government. Smuggled products were therefore 

 common. A departing embassy official in Delhi could sell 

 all his belongings, even used garments, for good prices, 

 such was the craze for foreign goods. This craze is not 

 there now because everything is made or imported into India. 

 Management was about small markets, small production capacities, 

 premium prices, poor quality and relative neglect of the 

 consumer. Most successful enterprises of past years had 

 bought into the political system like the Goenkas, Apollo 

 under Raunaq Singh, the Modis, Birlas and others.

 Dhirubhai Ambani also ably played 

 the system. But he was a great visionary, a tremendous manager 

 who was good at spotting and rewarding talented people and 

 a genius at innovative ways of raising finance. His visions 

 in deciding to integrate vertically, from oil well to wall 

 socket, planning for long-distance phone calls in India 

 to cost as much as a postcard, for fantastic volumes in 

 a variety of products and then creating markets for them, 

 would have assured his success in any environment.

 Hindustan Lever used government 

 policies to keep its business growing under majority foreign 

 shareholding. After 1991, though first off the mark in acquiring 

 new businesses, it could not integrate them successfully. 

 The world is different today for urban, industrial and commercial 

 India. We need the government to be more fixated on improving 

 it for all.

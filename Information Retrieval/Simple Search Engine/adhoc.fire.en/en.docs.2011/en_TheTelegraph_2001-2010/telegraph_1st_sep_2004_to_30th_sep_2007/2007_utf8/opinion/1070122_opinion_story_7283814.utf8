 ON SLIPPERY GROUND

 TWENTY-TWENTY -BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Farmers in Amritsar protesting against acquisition of land for an SEZ

 The government has put the clearance of special economic zones on hold till a comprehensive resettlement and rehabilitation plan governing land acquisition for big projects is put in place. This is perhaps in view of the disquiet among farmers from West Bengal to Haryana on land acquisition which is being fanned further by the political parties.

 However, the recent agitations are not so much about the desirability or otherwise of SEZs or big projects, even though some political groups have tried to package them as pro-big business and anti-farmer. Essentially, the disquiet among the oustees is about acquisition of land, compensation and their proper resettlement and rehabilitation.

 Only the government can acquire land in India citing the principle of eminent domain which means acting in the larger interest of the nation. Everybody else has to buy land. The resettlement and rehabilitation of those affected by land acquisition are the responsibility of the project authorities public or private. There the government has to decide how far it will go in implementing procedures and norms for resettlement and rehabilitation.

 The dimensions of this problem can be gauged from the number of SEZs being planned. At the last available count (December 6, 2006), various state and Union territory governments had granted formal approval for 237 SEZs with 34,509.71 hectares of land to be acquired, and approved another 163 SEZs in principle, for which the total land to be acquired was 148,663.11 hectares.

 It is in this context that a debate has arisen over land acquisition as well as resettlement and rehabilitation. The provisions of the National Policy for Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Project Affected families of 2003 clearly did not meet the peoples expectations. The issue was, therefore, reopened. A draft National Rehabilitation Policy is currently being discussed in the government.

 Any comprehensive policy on land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation must aim to do three things. It must create a collective and institutional negotiation mechanism for those affected by land acquisition. There should be mechanisms to take into account the perspective of the affected, not only to assess the socio-economic consequences of acquisition, but also compensation and resettlement. 

 The policy must set a floor price for the land being acquired, which may vary from region to region even within a state. Currently, compensation is decided on the basis of the last registered sale of land in the area. However, the last sale could be years ago and may not reflect current land prices. If the transaction is partly in black and partly in white money, then the rate of the registered land sale, even if recent, will not be realistic. Lastly, the policy must mandate that rehabilitation must include elements in addition to compensation for land such as equity or jobs for the oustees in the project.

 The existing policy framework does not meet any of these aims. It was originally proposed that a comprehensive resettlement and rehabilitation plan should be made part of the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 by amending it. The advice of the law ministry, however, was that while compensation was an essential part of land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation should not be incorporated in it as land is acquired by the government, compensation is its responsibility, but resettlement and rehabilitation are the responsibility of the project authorities.

 Land acquisition, which is in the eminent domain of the government, cannot be made justiciable. If it is allowed to be questioned legally, then a whole host of new and unmanageable problems would crop up, including unravelling the land reforms. However, resettlement and rehabilitation ought to be justiciable.

 The government is now believed to be exploring a separate resettlement and rehabilitation act, which would cover people displaced by land acquisition or for some other reason such as natural calamities. Enacting such a law would allow the oustees to go to court based on the provisions of the law rather than on the basis of less-clearly-defined grounds of natural justice. The new R amp;R act would take away the discretionary element and provide specific legal basis to approach the courts.

 However, an amendment would also be required to the Land Acquisition Act of 1894. There is a proposal that in acquiring land, the ownership rights of the landowners should not be completely taken away land could be acquired on perpetual lease or a 99-year lease, with the rights reverting back to the owner under certain circumstances say, in the case of irreversible project failure.This, as also giving a stake in the future of the project, would require a link between the R amp;R act and the Land Acquisition Act. There is yet another reason for incorporating some changes in the Land Acquisition Act. There is a proposal that prior to land acquisition, the government ought to conduct both an environmental impact assessment as well as a social impact assessment of the project.

 Based on these two assessments, it is proposed that the R amp;R policy be discussed with all the concerned gram-panchayats. This would provide the institutional mechanism for collective consultation with the oustees. The Land Acquisition Act has to ensure that in any acquisition of land, the provisions of the R amp;R act are applied. Social audit cannot be mandated in the R amp;R act and, therefore, has to be a part of the Land Acquisition Act.

 For large private enterprises, the government need not acquire land. Beyond a point, the votaries of the free market cannot be allowed to use the State to change the rules of the game in their favour. They can be asked to identify the land needed and negotiate its purchase directly with the farmers or their representatives. Some business groups are already doing this. The State should step in only when the market is sought to be distorted by some, taking undue advantage of the strategic location of their land, or if, say, 10 per cent or less of the project area is being held back for irrational reasons. In such circumstances, the government can exercise the principle of eminent domain and acquire the land at the market rate given to others.

 Yet another proposal could prevent the land acquired for an industrial project or an SEZ from being used for speculation or real-estate development deliberately or take care of the eventuality of project failure. If a part of the land acquired for an industrial project is earmarked for residential and infrastructural (hotels, hospitals) purposes, then the land could be clearly demarcated into two the industrial part and the non-industrial infrastructure part (houses, hotels, schools and hospitals). While industrial rates could be charged for the first part, real estate market rate after the industrial land has been acquired or after the project has been set up should be charged for the latter. There is no reason why the rate for both kinds of land-use should be the same. 

 It is just as well that the government has put the SEZs on hold. Not many of them have been implemented yet, as land acquisition is slow. The new law on resettlement and rehabilitation can be brought in the coming session of parliament. This would also ensure that the SEZs are not delayed indefinitely.

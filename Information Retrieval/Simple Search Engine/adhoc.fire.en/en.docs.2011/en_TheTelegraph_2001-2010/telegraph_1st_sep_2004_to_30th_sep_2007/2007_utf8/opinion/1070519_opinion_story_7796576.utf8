 LADS DAY OUT

 What women have done for years, men have thought of at last. Indian men are planning Mens Day on the lines of International Womens Day because they are terribly hurt that their rights are being ignored. The numerous feast-days and rituals for brothers, sons and sons-in-law in the various Indian cultures are just not enough to soothe their sensitive feelings. The lads want their day out on November 19, the day their brothers in Trinidad and Tobago celebrate their emancipation as well. They would all like to go international women can do it but they are a little confused about the date. Malta, Ukraine, Brazil, Norway, Canada, each has a different date for the celebration. Probably they will have to compete for the date they want boys begin to compete along with their toilet training and maybe plump for all these dates together just to beat the women at their own game.

 But Indian men are sure about their favourite date. November 19 is Indira Gandhis birthday. She was called the only man in her cabinet, and which man would not like that label? The macho ideal, smartly punched with noble respect for an extraordinary woman the Indian male should be burping with self-satisfaction. The deeper ironies of the choice may have just escaped him. 

 That is an inconsequential slip, given that men outscore women in IQ ratings by 4 points. Perhaps they have forgotten to claim that all IQ tests are designed by men. This is sure to be the case, since men are the experts in the field: one has just to look at science and cooking. The other reason for the choice of November 19 is sombre. It is the anniversary of the suicide, allegedly because of marital torture, of one of the members of Save Indian Family, an organization which fights against the oppression of men by women. Its main targets are the abuse of Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code and of the laws against domestic violence. Abuse of law is something they cannot tolerate, especially if someone else dares to try it. Their outrage springs from their innocence of the correct use of any law relating to gender justice, be it property or inheritance laws, marriage, divorce or maintenance laws, or the laws against dowry or rape.

 Being driven to suicide by a spouses torture is always tragic. To make that the more serious burden of Mens Day may lend the day its deserving dignity, but the logical consequence might be a bit startling. Especially as logic is a male preserve. This logic will make three or four or more womens days of every single day in the calendar and then some. But the world has come a long way from womens struggle for better working conditions, decent wages and reasonable working hours, all of which are celebrated on International Womens Day. The lads just need to feel special one more day over every day. They should have their day out.

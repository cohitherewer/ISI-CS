The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 OFF TRACK

 For a relationship that so routinely uses buses and trains as vehicles of expression, the message sent out by bombed train compartments is expected to be poignant. The gutted Samjhauta Express is supposed to derail the India-Pakistan peace process. The threat the attack conveys is no different from that which was borne out by the carnage that immediately preceded the first journey of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus two years ago. Any step to normalize relations between the two countries is seen by hardliners as an attempt by the establishment to soft-pedal the Kashmir issue. Bus or train diplomacy thus takes the first beating each time the nations are close to ending the hiatus in bilateral ties. Like the much-hyped bus service, the Samjhauta Express in 2004 signalled a rapprochement between the feuding neighbours. That the train managed to escape the wrath of militants so far, and even to expand its network, was perhaps owing to its utility to thousands of passengers who found it a convenient way to mend broken ties and carry out business. Unfortunately, such mundane affairs have never been the concern of troublemakers. An ominous message had to be sent out before the visit of the Pakistan foreign minister, Mr Khurshid Mahmood Kasuri, could take the dialogue to its next logical step. A success like the Samjhauta Express was an obvious target. 

 There is no reason to suspect that the bomb attack will permanently impair Indo-Pakistan relations, nor suspend train operations between the countries forever. Despite the initial hitches, the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus has taken off. The bomb attack on the train, too, is unlikely to keep determined travellers away for long. However, it is the commitment of the two governments to carrying on the peace process that will decide the severity of the immediate repercussions of the bombing. This is the first incident in which the majority of victims are of Pakistani origin. The fact that the bombs could have been planted in an unguarded railway station in India itself has also caused much consternation in the Pakistani establishment. It has accused the Indian administration of a security lapse with the same vehemence with which India often blames its neighbour in similar situations. Yet both the countries should be ashamed at this evident failure of their joint mechanism to combat terrorism.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 GODOTS PEOPLE

 When asked to comment on the findings of surveys on human behaviour, psychologists usually say perfectly obvious things. But explaining the anxiety that grips people while waiting in a queue as nervousness about not getting what one has been waiting for is perceptive. This is how one psychologist commented on these findings of a recent survey. Calcutta is where people have to queue the longest for just about everything; Calcuttans are generally more patient than people in Mumbai (the most impatient) and Chennai while waiting in a queue; but when they do lose their patience, Calcuttans get most angry. This neurotic mix of pathological patience and equally pathological rage is both amusing and alarming. It explains certain forms of civic failure, the poor standards in the delivery of basic services the nightmare of bills and banks. It also explains certain forms of mob violence in government hospitals for instance. 

 The sense that one can be deprived or cheated out of ones entitlements arises out of an essential mistrust, which is, in turn, the result of pervasive inequality. And this might be a way of understanding Indian behaviour in public spaces without necessarily confining oneself to Calcutta. Think of the mad scramble to get into the local trains in Mumbai at every station, even when the compartments are far from crowded. Or the irrational surge of panic and haste in trying to find ones reserved berth on the train, and the resentment, on finding it, towards anybody happening to be sitting on it temporarily (perhaps just a person who has come to see somebody off). Perhaps the root of the problem lies in too many people fighting for limited facilities and resources, and a group of empowered people exploiting this sense of urgency for their own greedy and corrupt ends. At the other end, enduring inefficiency and lethargy should not always be dignified by the name of patience. It should be seen rather as an equally damaging incapacity for organized civic reaction.

 Whos afraid of chasing?

 Sir Rahul Dravid cited a tired bowling attack for not enforcing the follow-on in the final Test against England (Dra- vid pragmatic, says British media, Aug 14). While Indian captains are known to defend even the daftest of moves, this one was a bit too rich. If our bowlers tire after bowling 20-odd overs in an innings, they have no business playing Test cricket. The real reason behind Dravids decision was to avoid chasing in the fourth innings. After all, hadnt the Indians made a mess of scoring 120-odd runs against the West Indies?

 More blood

 Sir Prerna Parasrampuria, the young girl who was mowed down by a speeding bus recently, was the third person to die on the citys streets in as many days (Racing bus crushes teenager, Aug 17). The rise in the number of road accidents has exposed the deplorable condition of the citys traffic control system. Worse, the police, the government and transport unions are busy passing the buck instead of working together to solve the problem. That the police are incapable of stopping road accidents is difficult to believe, especially since the same force shows remarkable efficiency when it comes to catching couples from parks or collecting bribes. In recent times, the force has also gone about organizing para football tournaments to befriend citizens. However, the polices inability to put a stop to accidents is surely going to put a damper on their friendly overtures. 

 The failure on the part of the cops has led to few errant drivers getting punished for their crimes. Apart from goading the cops to nab the culprits, the government should also think of arranging regular workshops for bus drivers to help them learn traffic rules. Only this can check reckless driving and make Calcuttas streets safe. 

 Yours faithfully

 Sir The accident at Pathuriaghata street, which claimed the life of Prerna Parasrampuria, a schoolgirl, came as a shock. I think that the tragedy took place because of two factors; reckless driving by bus drivers, and the illegal parking of heavy vehicles on both sides of the road. Apart from the threat posed by vehicular traffic, the residents of this area also have to put up with noise and air pollution. Emission from trucks and the noise of air horns continue to be health hazards. 

 Unfortunately, even after the death of the young girl, the authorities have not bothered to take the necessary steps to improve traffic conditions in the area and beyond it. The trucks continue to flout traffic rules, even as the police look the other way. One hopes that the medias coverage of accidents in the city will force the authorities take corrective measures in the near future.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir I returned to Calcutta recently to find that the city has not changed a bit. Road accidents are a dime a dozen, as are instances of passengers being fleeced in the airport. The other day, after landing in Calcutta, I stood in a long queue to book a prepaid cab. A stranger came up to me and informed that an authorized prepaid booth had come up outside the building. Believing him, I walked outside to a counter where receipts for prepaid taxis were being issued. I noticed that the foreigner in front was charged Rs 390 for a ride to Park Street, which was almost double the normal fare. Seeing this, I made my way back to the original counter and got a cab. These days, we are being told that Calcutta is a city which is on the move. While that may be true, has anyone wondered which direction the city is headed? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Kamal Thacker, 

 Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Light into paint

 Arup Lodhs first solo exhibition 

 of paintings, Mood, at the spectacularly ill-kept 

 Gaganendra Pradarsha Shala (Aug 26-28) included some highly 

 accomplished watercolours and oils on paper. Most of these 

 works depict scenes on the streets of Calcutta at different 

 hours of the day. The quality of light and the feel of the 

 air change accordingly. A solitary tram, with a few ghostly 

 cars, is bathed in a rich golden light. It is probably twilight 

 and the streets look wet. Perhaps there is also a nip in 

 the air. Lodhs technical mastery transports these urban 

 moments from a purely visual experience to an area of physical 

 sensations one catches oneself trying to discern the surrounding 

 noises or even the texture of the air. The panoramic views 

 of the city, on foggy wintry evenings, are distinctly reminiscent 

 of the Impressionists, particularly Renoir, Monet and Turner. 

 The figures on the seashore appear against a mysterious, 

 dusky shade. While these images sustain the sense of heightened 

 reality, the pictures of destitute people, flora and fauna 

 seem dull. Against the realism of these images, painted 

 with consummate skill, Lodhs abstract works appear amateurish 

 and lacking in sense or imagination. The silly titles do 

 not help either.

 Dance of life

 Every mythology has its share of good and evil, and the roles of god and Satan are often transposed. Talk of religious diversity today invariably ends up in violence. Prakriti Bhaskar, a dancer-choreographer from Mumbai, has taken the initiative to remind us that human beings were created to maintain balance in the world. Religion had nothing to do with that cosmic activity. Prakritis presentation, Katha Shristi, on August 23 at the EZCC auditorium in Salt Lake, was based on a biblical creation myth. The story begins with the creation of the natural elements like fire, water, and finally, of life. Christianity perceives Adam and Eve as our earliest ancestors. In a moment of weakness, they were lured into an act that has always been the symbol of the primal human error. This story was presented through Bharatnatyam, Carnatic music, narrations and chants from the Rig-Veda and Upanishads. The 55-minute production held the audience rapt. Tillana, one of the rhythmic numbers in Bharatnatyam, was danced by Adam and Eve in the love-making sequence and it was beautifully put together by the choreographer. The performance ended on a redemptive note with Adam and Eves vision of the Messiah. The dance postures were perfectly executed and abhinaya was the performers forte.

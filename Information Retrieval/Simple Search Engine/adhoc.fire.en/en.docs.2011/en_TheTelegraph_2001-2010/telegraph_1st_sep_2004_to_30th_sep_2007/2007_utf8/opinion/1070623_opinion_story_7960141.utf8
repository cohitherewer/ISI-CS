 COLLEGE OF THE FAITH

 Contradictions are often the source of thought. In recent times, there has been no bigger contradiction in public discourse than the neologism, Dalit Christians. This concept is at the heart of the controversy now raging over St Stephens College in Delhi. So profound is the contradiction embedded in the term, Dalit Christian, that it can actually be called an oxymoron. The Christian faith does not recognize the caste system in any form. In fact, one of the propaganda devices used by Christian missionaries was the appeal that the converted would not have to suffer any kind of discrimination because of caste. There is some irony in the fact that now a section within the Christian community is trying to reinforce its caste identity by claiming quotas for its members in an institution like Mission College the fond name given to St Stephens by many of its alumni. But forgetting the neologism for the moment, it is worth looking at the plight of Christian missionary institutions in India.

 Christian missionaries, when they began spreading their faith in India, used education as one of their most important platforms. They set up schools and colleges first in the major towns and cities and then in the mofussil. Their aim was to educate those who had embraced Christianity and were therefore barred from entering Hindu or Muslim educational institutions. Some of the Christian educational establishments the names of St Xaviers School and College in Calcutta and St Stephens College in Delhi come immediately to mind went far beyond their original scope and intention. Their excellence attracted students who were not Christians. In fact, the fame of these two institutions rested on the many outstanding non-Christian students they produced. Over the years, they have ceased to be Christian institutions save in their names and their original charters. They have fallen into what can be called the excellence trap. They sought and got excellence in education. The price for this was a neglect of the community they are supposed to represent.

 The inevitable backlash has, in fact, been slow in coming. Through the last twenty years within Indian society, religious identities have been on the rise, and there has been a growing demand for reservations in educational institutions based on religion and caste. Under these circumstances, a college like St Stephens has been under tremendous pressure. (St Xaviers in Calcutta has not encountered this to that extent because of its location.) St Stephens is trying to retrieve its original purpose. Its choice of terms may have been a trifle thoughtless, and even somewhat against the basic tenets of Christianity, but the point is important. The college is facing a crisis of identity. Does it remain the Mission College? To retain its identity, it must begin to look towards the meek who, the Lord said, would inherit the earth.

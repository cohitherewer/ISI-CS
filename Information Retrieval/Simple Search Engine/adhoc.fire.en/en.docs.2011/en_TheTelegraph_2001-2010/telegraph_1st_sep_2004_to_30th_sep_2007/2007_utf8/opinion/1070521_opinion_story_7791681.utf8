 - A political background is not essential for a good president 

 Commentarao

 S.L. Rao

 N. Sanjiva Reddy 

 and R. Venkatraman 

 Next month India chooses a new 

 president and within two years a new prime minister. What 

 has characterized the better ones in the past? We need to 

 have some perspective to judge them.

 Venality, family nepotism, a strong 

 political base, preparedness for the job, a clear vision 

 of what is sought to be achieved, manipulative skills 

 these positive and negative qualities jostle in the nature 

 of a prime minister. Presidents have gravitas, are 

 better educated and have clear ideas of their constitutional 

 responsibility. There have been many exceptions. Fortunately, 

 at the time of Independence, India had great leadership, 

 unlike Russia after the Soviet Union. Russias first president, 

 Boris Yeltsin, had no vision of where he wanted to take 

 the Soviet Union. He was drunkenly playful and garrulous 

 at the most inappropriate times, almost destroyed the Russian 

 economy, handed over huge chunks of state assets to gangster 

 oligarchs, was responsible for the premature deaths of 

 many because of malnutrition and lack of medical care, and 

 did not prepare Russians and Russia for a democratic polity.

 Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari 

 Vajpayee had the vision while P.V. Narasimha Rao and Rajiv 

 Gandhi had vision but lacked the leadership skills. Nehrus 

 vision for India was that of a progressive, plural, modern 

 democracy. If India has defied prophets of doom to survive 

 as a democracy with many pluralities in its population, 

 it is due to his vision.

 Lal Bahadur Shastri was a Gandhian, 

 close to Nehru and a life-long politician. He seemed to 

 have a vision but war with Pakistan and premature death 

 prevented him from giving it shape. Narasimha Rao was also 

 a lifelong politician, and a scholar. He had to run a minority 

 government and the fractious Congress with little popular 

 backing. But he initiated the transformation of the Indian 

 economy and gave foreign policy a global vision. He could 

 not prevent the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya.

 Rajiv Gandhis education was limited 

 to living with his prime minister mother. Familiar with 

 technology, he wanted a modern India and improved ties with 

 the West. His lack of political experience prevented any 

 major accomplishment after his first two years.

 Vajpayee was a founder of one 

 of Indias major parties, a sensitive poet and a charismatic 

 speaker. He was the first non-Congress leader to last a 

 full term. He changed the worlds view of India and gave 

 it global respect with the nuclear bomb tests, continuing 

 economic liberalization and softening the anti-American 

 stance in vogue. He changed Indias direction. His successors 

 have to follow his lead. He surely has a place in history. 

 The aberration of not rushing in Central forces to protect 

 Muslims in Gujarat will remain a black mark against him 

 and his party.

 Other prime ministers, including 

 Indira Gandhi, may not always have placed the country above 

 their interests. Indira Gandhis political education happened 

 through her being her fathers hostess. He did not teach 

 her the liberalism and tolerance of dissent that he practised. 

 Her economic illiteracy put Indias development back by 

 20 years. Her paranoia, her desire to keep all power in 

 her hands and her converting the Congress into a family 

 heritage, bereft of alternative leaders, are known. The 

 positive thing about her reign was her leadership in dealing 

 with East Pakistan and her helping it to become Bangladesh. 

 Her grandson tactlessly called it her plan to break Pakistan.

 Morarji Desai was a rigid Gandhian. 

 But he allowed his son to misuse his position. He did not 

 seem to have a vision or the political skills to achieve 

 a purpose. The men around him, like Charan Singh and Chandra 

 Shekhar, ensured that he was ineffective. The major initiative 

 of his regime was taken by the then home minister, Charan 

 Singh, who hounded Indira Gandhi, gave her a martyrs halo 

 and the determination to come back to power. They thus lost 

 India the opportunity to rid itself of this dynasty. And 

 as prime minister, Charan Singh, despite a lifetime in politics, 

 never overcame the loyalty to his Jat community and his 

 rural background.

 V.P. Singh was an accidental politician. 

 As finance minister, he was credited by many with the early 

 moves to liberalize the economy. But liberalization owes 

 to Rajiv Gandhis vision. V.P. Singhs caste-oriented policies 

 were a crime against a pluralistic Indian democracy. His 

 reign was devoid of any vision or action for development; 

 he brought discord and was unable to handle the economic 

 crises that occurred when oil prices rose.

 There were prime ministers who 

 held the job for short periods at a time because of political 

 compromises. This includes that noble Gandhian, Gulzarilal 

 Nanda, who was once interim prime minister. Others include 

 the devious Charan Singh, Chandra Shekhar who was entirely 

 at Rajiv Gandhis mercy, H.D. Deve Gowda having his strings 

 pulled by Sitaram Kesri, and that acceptable political face 

 for all parties, I.K Gujral. None made any mark on India 

 or initiated policies to improve its future. Except for 

 Nanda and Gujral, they were all ambitious beyond their competence, 

 manipulative without conscience and brought benefit to only 

 themselves and their coteries.

 Rajendra Prasad (a leader during 

 the independence movement) as president tried unsuccessfully 

 to define greater powers for the presidency. S. Radhakrishnan 

 (a philosopher) spoke out against the growing influence 

 of the military and industry. Zakir Hussein (a nationalist, 

 an educationist and institution builder) was pained by the 

 allegations whispered against him during the Pakistan war. 

 R. Venkatraman (an able minister and politician) was an 

 impeccable president. The remaining presidents had ideologies 

 and agendas that intruded on their role as president.

 V.V. Giri (a labour leader), an 

 unremarkable president, was Indira Gandhis creature, so 

 situated as to break the syndicate of old men in her party. 

 Fakruddin Ali Ahmed (a lawyer and politician) will always 

 be remembered for meekly signing the declaration of Emergency. 

 Zail Singh ( a politician and ineffective minister) said 

 after he was sworn in as president that he would take a 

 broom and sweep the floor if Indira Gandhi asked him to 

 do so. His Rashtrapati Bhavan became a den of intrigue, 

 with the president taking an active interest in the unstable 

 Punjab situation. Later, when he fell out with Rajiv Gandhi, 

 he is said to have conspired against him for his dismissal. 

 The claim of Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy (a towering politician 

 from Andhra Pradesh) to fame as president was his invitation 

 to Charan Singh to form the government without a floor vote 

 for Morarji Desai. Charan Singh had deserted with some Janata 

 Party members.

 K.R. Narayanan ( a foreign service 

 bureaucrat and pretentious intellectual with strong leftist 

 ideology) allowed his leftist sympathies to put him at odds 

 with the National Democratic Alliance government. He is 

 said to have prevented the government from talking to Myanmarese 

 generals about refusing refuge to militants from the North-East. 

 His family connections with Aung San Su Kyi who, with her 

 mother, stayed with his family after Aung San was assassinated, 

 are said to be responsible.

 Prime ministers with a strong 

 political base and vast political experience have a greater 

 chance of success. The ideal prime minister is one who has 

 courage to act without fear of allies or the opposition, 

 has political experience, a clear vision, the ability to 

 listen and learn without disclosing intentions till the 

 ground is prepared, and without making permanent enemies.

 Neither presence nor absence of 

 political background seems to guarantee a good president, 

 who will be neutral towards ideology and between people. 

 A president with political experience may have the advantage 

 of knowing the limits but might also interfere. A good education, 

 integrity, objectivity and a willingness to live within 

 the limits of the job are essential.

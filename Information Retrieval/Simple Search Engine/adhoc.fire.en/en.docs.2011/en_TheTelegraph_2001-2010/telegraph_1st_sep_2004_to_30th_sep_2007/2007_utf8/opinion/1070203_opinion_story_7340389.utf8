The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Keep the faith

 Sir The apex court recently ruled that television interviews given by an accused could be considered as evidence by the courts. Such a directive only goes to show the importance the judiciary gives to the medias role in reporting events objectively. However, it is imperative that the fourth estate does not sit on such laurels. In fact, the media should work harder to keep intact the faith the judiciary has reposed on them. Perhaps the show of confidence would curb the medias tendency to sensationalize news.

 Yours faithfully,

 An era ends

 Sir O.P. Nayyar, one of Indias greatest music directors and composers of all time, is no more. His death has created a vacuum in the world of music which will be difficult to fill. Nayyars music was truly evergreen people still remember his decades-old tunes. The legacy left behind by this composer will continue to inspire future generations of singers and music directors. With Nayyars death, an era has come to an end in Hindi film music. But there is little doubt about the fact that he will be remembered with a lot of respect by fans and musicians alike.

 Yours faithfully,

Mehnaaz Manawar, Cuttack

 Sir The report, Nayyar dead (Jan 30), was certainly not a fitting tribute to O.P. Nayyar, a maverick composer and a man of prodigious talent. Fifty-five years ago, Nayyar proved his mettle in Aasman, his debut film. After that, he continued to deliver hit compositions in movies such as Aar Paar, CID and Mr. amp; Mrs. 55. 

 It is quite surprising to see The Telegraph make such a brief reference about the death of a musician who had held his fans captive with the magic of his tunes for two decades. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Lovers of Hindi film music would be saddened by the death of the legendary O.P. Nayyar. Nayyars music was truly melodious, and it was largely a fusion of Punjabi and Bengali tunes. Today, Hindi film music is more about noise than notes. The sweet and simple tunes of Nayyar are greatly missed. This talented composer had the uncanny ability to produce the right set of notes, which never failed to produce the image that the lyricist had in mind. Nayyar was not only a talented musician, but also a humble soul. His memory will remain with us forever, just like his compositions.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K.Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir The Hindi film industry has lost one of its doyens with the passing away of O.P. Nayyar. Nayyar entered Bollywood when stalwarts like S.D. Burman and Madan Mohan were in their hey-day. Undaunted, Nayyar went on to introduce a new trend in film music and give gifted singers like Asha Bhonsle and Mohammad Rafi their first big break. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Mahapatro, Berhampur

 Sir O.P. Nayyar was one of the few music directors who remained active professionally despite his advancing years. As a matter of fact, he even featured in a musical talent hunt show as a judge. There has never been any doubts about Nayyars talents. His successful career in Hindi film music spanned well over two decades. Apart from being an able composer, Nayyar was a very strong-willed person. He forged a successful partnership with Asha Bhosle although the great Lata Mangeshkar never sung for him. Nevertheless, it will be difficult for people to forget his background scores, which made him a true legend. 

 Yours faithfully, 

B. Srinivasan, Pune

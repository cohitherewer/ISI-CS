 SEIZE THE DAY AND TURN THE BEND

 Mamata Banerjee has several reasons to welcome the Lefts peace moves in Nandigram. But she cannot let peace take away the political advantage she has gained, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Claiming centrestage once more

 Embattled as never before, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has plenty of reasons for wanting peace in Nandigram. His government and the Left Front are in the dock for the March 14 police firing there. Some 4,000 supporters of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), who were evicted from their homes in Nandigram, are forced to live in camps, and his government has been unable to do anything to help them for four months. The post-Nandigram developments have posed the most serious challenge in the past thirty years to the Left Fronts unity. Above all, violence in Nandigram and to a lesser extent, in Singur has threatened to derail his drive for industrialization. 

 But why would Mamata Banerjee want peace? Just as the chief minister is anxious for peace to return to Nandigram, she would have liked to keep the Nandigram fire burning. 

 Consider the political benefits that the Singur-Nandigram stirs have brought her. Two humiliating defeats first in the Lok Sabha polls in 2004, when the Trinamool Congresss tally dropped from nine to one, and then in the assembly elections last year had darkened her political future. First Singur and then Nandigram proved to be the oxygen she needed in order to return to the centre-stage of Bengal politics. 

 In fact, one could say that Banerjee never had it so good. Never in her brief political career did she have an issue that had such a popular appeal. Wasnt she defending the rights of poor farmers whom the government was out to displace in its zeal for capitalist development? It was an appeal that drew even some Naxalites, who have otherwise no love lost for her, over to her agitation. 

 Why should she give up the advantage? If violence now is seen to have a moral and political justification, why should she talk peace? Why let Bhattacharjee and the CPI(M) off the hook, especially when she has all the reasons to use her advantage in next years panchayat elections? 

 If all this makes you think that her peace offer on Nandigram is fake, you might be wrong. Banerjee may be unpredictable, but she has now been long enough in politics not to learn a few tricks of the trade. She has learnt, for instance, that she can no longer be seen as the politician who fights only street battles. Results of all recent elections have proved that such an image is no winner. With only a militant image, she can be powerful enough to organize bandhs, storm into the assembly or incite violence on a larger scale. But such actions cannot give the image of a responsible politician who can be trusted with governing the state. 

 You could argue that the CPI(M) and other leftist parties too have come to power with the help of violence. True, but that was in another time, when that brand of politics was a winning formula. Unfortunately for Banerjee, an upwardly mobile India or Bengal has little patience with spoilsports and the politics of violence. 

 More important, Banerjee has compulsions that many of her comrades-in-arms in Singur and Nandigram do not have. The Naxalites or other ultra-Left politicians who have made common cause with her on Singur or Nandigram have a one-dimensional approach to the politics of development. To them, capitalist industrialization is totally unacceptable. They care nothing for the peace that Bhattacharjee needs for new industries to come to Bengal. Whether you agree with them or not, you know that their arguments are ideological.

 With Banerjee, it is a very different game. Unlike the Naxalites, she is a politician whose strategies must ultimately be suited to the all-important goal of winning elections and being in power. She cannot afford to throw the baby of industrialization out with the anti-CPI(M) bathwater. It cannot be a coincidence that she has been careful to project an industry-friendly image of late. 

 Also, she cannot be endlessly tied to Nandigram. The next assembly elections in Bengal may be rather distant, but she has her sights fixed on the 2009 parliamentary polls. Thus, she is once again building bridges with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the National Democratic Alliance, with both of which she kept a distance after the NDAs defeat in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. Her hopes may have taken a beating in the BJPs poor show in the Uttar Pradesh elections, but she sees a future in New Delhi if the NDA comes back to power. It suits her strategy for Bengal too because an NDA government at the Centre can greatly help her battle against the CPI(M) before the 2011 assembly polls in the state. 

 In other words, she is in the business of politics in the way that the Naxalites or the Left liberals, who have opposed Bhattacharjees industrialization, are not. And, if the peace moves that she has initiated through the Forward Bloc leader, Ashok Ghosh, can widen the fissures within the Left Front, that can add to her advantage. 

 How, then, does one see her return to the battlefields of Singur three days before the first round of the peace talks? There are two possible answers. One, it is the result of the Naxalites pressure on her to put up militant shows. She had thought of using the Naxalites in the anti-CPI(M) battles, just as the latter wanted to use her to suit their agenda. But she is now paying the price of riding the Naxalite tiger. 

 The other explanation is that she herself prefers a strategy that would alternate between peace initiatives and some forms of militancy. She cannot give the impression that she has conceded the Singur fight. Nor can she afford to let peace take away the political advantage she has gained in Nandigram. All this does not make her peace moves doubtful; but she clearly has several contradictions to manage. 

 Whatever her other faults, Banerjee is not so nave as to expect the peace moves to quickly solve problems in Nandigram that have defied solutions for four months. It cannot be too difficult for her to guess how unhappy the CPI(M) must be with its partners for their roles in the peace games. 

 But, even if the peace moves fail, she can turn the failure into an advantage by blaming it on the CPI(M). And, she may be supported in that campaign by the smaller partners of the Left Front. 

 It may be too early to predict what the long-term effects of the Singur-Nandigram battles would be on Bengals politics. Be it industrialization or any other issue, Banerjee has always fought the CPI(M). Even before the current turmoil broke, the Naxalites and the Left liberals have had no sympathy for the ruling Marxists, who, they say, are as unabashedly capital-friendly as the Congress or the BJP. The events in Nandigram only confirmed their views of the Marxists. The big question is whether a sizeable section of CPI(M) sympathizers have lost their faith in the party. 

 We may get a hint of the real change in the popular mood during next Sundays vote to five municipalities and the by-elections to 500-odd panchayat seats. A bigger test awaits both Banerjee and the CPI(M) in next years state-wide panchayat polls.

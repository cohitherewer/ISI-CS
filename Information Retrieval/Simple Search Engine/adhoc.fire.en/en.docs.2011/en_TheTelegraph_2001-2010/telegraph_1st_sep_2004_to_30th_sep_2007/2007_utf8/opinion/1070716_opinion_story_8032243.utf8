 FROM FOOD 

 TO FUEL 

 FIFTH COLUMN

 Gwynne Dyer

 The 

 era of cheap food is over. The price of corn (maize) has 

 doubled in a year, and the cost of wheat now is at its highest 

 in a decade. The food price index in India has risen 11 

 per cent in one year, and in Mexico, in January, there were 

 riots after the price of cornflour went up four-fold. Even 

 in the developed countries, food prices are going up, and 

 they are not going to come down again.

 Cheap food lasted for only fifty 

 years. Before the Second World War, most families in the 

 developed countries spent a third or more of their income 

 on food. But after the war, a series of radical changes, 

 from mechanization to the Green Revolution raised agricultural 

 productivity hugely and caused a long, steep fall in the 

 real price of food. For the global middle-class, it was 

 the good old days, with food taking only a tenth of their 

 income.

 It will probably be back up to 

 a quarter within a decade, and it may go much higher than 

 that, because we are entering a period when three separate 

 factors are converging to drive food prices up. The first 

 is simply demand. Not only is the global population continuing 

 to grow, but as Asian economies race ahead more and more 

 people in those populous countries are starting to eat significant 

 amounts of meat.

 Early this month, in its annual 

 assessment of farming trends, the United Nations predicted 

 that by 2016, people in the developing countries will be 

 eating 30 per cent more beef, 50 per cent more pig meat 

 and 25 per cent more poultry. The animals will need a great 

 deal of grain, and meeting that demand will require shifting 

 huge amounts of grain-growing land from human to animal 

 consumption so the prices of grain and meat will both 

 go up. 

 Up, up, and away

 The global poor dont care about 

 the price of meat, because they cannot afford it even now 

 but if the price of grain goes up, some of them will starve. 

 And maybe they wont have to wait until 2016, because the 

 mania for bio-fuels is shifting huge amounts of land out 

 of food production. One-sixth of all the grain grown in 

 the United States of America this year will be industrial 

 corn, destined to be converted into ethanol and burned 

 in cars. Europe, Brazil and China are all heading in the 

 same direction.

 The attraction of bio-fuels for 

 politicians is obvious: they can claim that they are doing 

 something useful to combat emissions and global warming 

 without actually demanding any sacrifices from business 

 or the voters. The amount of US farmland devoted to bio-fuels 

 grew by 48 per cent in the last year alone, and hardly any 

 new land was brought under the plough to replace the lost 

 food production. In other big bio-fuel producers like China 

 and Brazil, it is the same straight switch from food to 

 fuel. In fact, the food market and the energy market are 

 becoming closely linked, which is very bad news for the 

 poor.

 As oil prices rise (and the rapid 

 economic growth in Asia guarantees that they will), they 

 pull up the price of bio-fuels as well, and it gets even 

 more attractive for farmers to switch from food to fuel. 

 Nor will politics save the day. As economist Lester Brown 

 of the Earth Policy Institute told the US Congress last 

 month: The stage is now set for direct competition for 

 grain between the 800 million people who own automobiles, 

 and the worlds two billion poorest people. Guess who would 

 win.

 In the early stages of this process, 

 higher food prices will help millions of farmers who have 

 been scraping along on very poor returns for their effort 

 because political power lies in the cities. But later, it 

 gets uglier. The price of food relative to average income 

 is heading for levels that have not been seen since the 

 early 19th century, and it will not come down again in our 

 lifetime.

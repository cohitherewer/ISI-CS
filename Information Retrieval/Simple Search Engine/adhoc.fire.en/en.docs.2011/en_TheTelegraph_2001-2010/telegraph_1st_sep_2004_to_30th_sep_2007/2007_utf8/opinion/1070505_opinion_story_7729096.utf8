 Dance

 International Dance Day is celebrated the world over on April 29 in the memory of Jean-Georges Noverre, the famous French dancer and choreographer. The West Bengal chapter of World Dance Alliance-Asia Pacific, West Bengal Dance Group Federation and West Bengal State Music Academy joined hands with the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre and ICCR to present a dance-bouquet on the day at Rabindra Sadan. The programme was split into two sessions. The first half got under way with two documentaries on Govindan Kutty and Chandralekha. Arundhati Chakraborty of Behala Ragini, with her troupe, presented Arghya, a performance marred by the dismal costume. Soma Dutta of Charaibeti, in an untitled production, conveyed her feelings for the young, who are often ill-treated by the elders. Her child artistes have mastered not only the creative style of dance but also mime-acting.

 In the evening, Chumvan Sodachivey (Abbelle) and Khiev Sovannarith from Cambodia presented Robam Sovanmachaa or the Golden Mermaid Dance (picture). Hanumas falling in love with a beautiful mermaid is one of the many local stories that have got assimilated into the Ramayana as it travelled from India to Cambodia. The subtle movements of the dancers made it an aesthetic delight. 

 The recounting of the life cycle by dancers of the Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts reminded one of Sharira, choreographed by Chandralekha. Joydip Palit failed to depict the finer nuances of Tagores Ami chanchalo he in his composition. Ranan presented Shunyo se, a noteworthy performance, using tracks from Vanessa Maes album, Storm. The last two presentations of the evening were the outcome of the workshops conducted by Emma Powell of Australia and I-Fen Tung of Taiwan. Powells Ritmos was a mind-boggling production. Tung experimented with two worlds the dancers and the choreographers. The idea was to spread a kind of neo-aesthetic awareness among todays choreographers. One wonders how much fruit that effort will bear.

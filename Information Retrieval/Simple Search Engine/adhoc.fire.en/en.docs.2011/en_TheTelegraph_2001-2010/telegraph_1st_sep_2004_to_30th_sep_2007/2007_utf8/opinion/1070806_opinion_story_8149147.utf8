The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TWO VERSUS FOUR

 The current boom has been good for the vehicle industry; in turn, it has been one of the leading industries in the boom. In the five years to 2006-07, passenger-car sales more than doubled to 1.38 million. Sales of two-wheelers did less well, growing by 87 per cent to 786,000; still, it was a respectable performance. Clearly, as Indians got richer, they abandoned buses and bicycles and mounted motorcycles; but those who had scooters and motorcycles were selling them and buying cars. The shift to the comfort of closed and covered vehicles was stronger than the shift to personal vehicles overall. This clear trend has, however, been broken since April. In May, car sales rose by 10 per cent, and two-wheeler sales fell by almost the same percentage. Sales generally gather pace in February and March as dealers try to clear their inventories before the end of the year. So sales in the first months of the new financial year can be sluggish. But the contrast in performance has continued in the following two months; in June as well as July, two-wheeler sales have been below the level in the same months last year, while car sales have continued to grow. 

 The woes of the two-wheeler industry have been blamed on the Reserve Banks tightening of bank credit. But it is not as if car buyers do not borrow. Personal vehicles make a dent in buyers pockets, and most buyers have to borrow something, whether it is from banks, relatives or dealers. The connections of car dealers with lenders are closer; buyers can often get a loan through the dealer while they are buying a car. But the money ultimately comes from the same lenders; so it should get tighter for all buyers. Hence it is more likely that the trends say something about what is happening to the economy. A car-buyer is usually someone who has had decent earnings for some time, and who feels secure about his income; a buyer of a motorcycle is more often a young man who has just got his first job and who wants to celebrate. It seems that while there is no overall decline, hirings are slowing down the first signs of a slow-down in the economy. 

 It will not be long before the small car from the Tatas will hit the market; it is an interesting question whether it will behave like a car and do well, or behave like a two-wheeler and do badly. Its customers will be first-time car-owners, many of them graduating from two-wheelers; if so, Tata Motors may be in for an unpleasant surprise. So, however, will be many other companies if the economy is heading towards a downturn. It may be that the two-wheeler industry is telling Indians something none of them would like to hear.

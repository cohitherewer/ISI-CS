 BREAK BARRIERS

 The World Banks resident representative in Delhi may soon be called in to the commerce ministry and given an earful. For its Dhaka office has come out with a study questioning the likely benefits of a free trade agreement between Bangladesh and India, which Mr Kamal Nath pressed for when Begum Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh prime minister, visited Delhi in March. Then he had tried to make the Bangladeshis jealous of Sri Lanka; after the FTA with Sri Lanka, he had said, bilateral trade had quadrupled in three years, imbalance in Indias favour had come down from 15:1 to 4:1, and India had emerged as Sri Lankas third largest investor. Now the World Bank has given substance to Bangladeshs doubts about entering into an FTA with India. The new studys basic point is that if Bangladesh preferentially reduces duties on imports from India, its residents will get cheaper imports, but the imports from India may actually replace even cheaper goods currently being imported from east Asia. It also expresses fear that Indian exporters may collude amongst themselves or with Bangladeshs importers and raise prices. Indias gains will, in any case, be modest because Bangladesh can never account for a significant proportion of its trade. Before Mr Nath reacts, however, he should read the whole report. It is not hostile to India; in fact, it argues for more trade between the two countries, and that trade would respond better to other measures.

 India should dismantle non-tariff trade restrictions on Bangladeshs exports, in particular garment exports; and it should improve facilities and reduce customs-related obstruction at check points through which traded goods pass between the two countries. The point is that the present government in India is in at least two minds. Mr P. Chidambaram has continued, in every budget, to reduce import duties. Mr Nath, on the other hand, likes to play politics with trade. To this end, he has maintained non-tariff barriers, in the hope of trading them off against trade concessions from other countries. But his enthusiasm for FTAs and more high-sounding deals is not shared by other commerce ministers. They have seen that the FTA has not prevented India from imposing ad hoc import restrictions on imports from Sri Lanka, notably those of tea and pepper. Nor has it enabled Singapore banks to open branches in India.

 Non-trade barriers are a quintessentially discretionary and arbitrary instrument; even the commerce ministry should see how much damage it has done to relations with neighbours. India has still quite far to go in reducing import duties, especially on agricultural goods. But the priority must be to reduce non-trade barriers, especially on textile products. Their reduction will do more to reduce the ill will between India and its neighbours. That it will give our people access to cheaper clothes would be a bonus.

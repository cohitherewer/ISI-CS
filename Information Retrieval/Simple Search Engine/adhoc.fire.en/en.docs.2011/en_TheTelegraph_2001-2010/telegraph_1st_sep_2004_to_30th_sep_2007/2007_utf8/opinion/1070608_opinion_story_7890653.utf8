 TIME TO GET 

 REAL 

 BONA FIDE

 Malvika Singh

 The 

 scorching heat is unbearable, as is the degraded politics 

 of our country. First information reports are being filed 

 for all manner of strange acts, ranging from the publication 

 of calendars featuring Vasundhara Raje as a goddess to orders 

 for the arrest of the Gujjar leader, Kirori Singh Baisna, 

 for having inspired the community to launch violent protests 

 while demanding scheduled tribe status. Reservation of this 

 kind is absurd. It shows that the government has failed 

 to be inclusive and treat all citizens equally in the last 

 sixty years. Had governance been effective, the nation could 

 have solved the problem to a large extent. 

 Today, numerous communities in 

 the country want to be included in the quota system. The 

 leadership has also pandered to their demands, thereby creating 

 volatile vote banks that are holding the country to ransom. 

 Political parties are caught in the tentacles of the demon 

 they have created. Undoubtedly, the United Progressive Alliance, 

 too, will make all kinds of wild electoral promises to the 

 agitating Gujjars and there will be an even more aggravated 

 situation on the cards a few months later. 

 This is not all. Potential presidential 

 candidates are engaged in endless political games although 

 a majority of them do not deserve to become the president 

 as they are politicians and not statesmen. This charade 

 is a sad commentary on our definition of excellence. In 

 the Fifties and the Sixties, our leaders were of different 

 stock. They considered certain things to be sacrosanct. 

 For instance, their lust for power was not so pronounced 

 then. Today however, the leaders are not respected but perceived 

 as individuals who have chosen to be in an unsavoury profession 

 such as politics. They are not interested in serving the 

 public. Their knowledge too is limited and they frame policies 

 on the basis of half-baked information. 

 Face the heat

 Global warming has become the 

 single most important international issue. Suddenly our 

 bureaucrats and leaders are mouthing the jargon without 

 understanding the enormity of the problem. I say this because 

 every recent act of the government that has to do with the 

 environment has been retrograde, starting with the forest 

 bill. An adamant Communist Party of India (Marxist) ensured 

 that the existing safeguards were overriden by proposing 

 a fresh enactment and the UPA allowed itself to be bullied 

 into an agreement because it did not think that opposing 

 the bill was a matter of importance. 

 In one stroke, the Congress-led 

 government at the Centre dismantled all the laws that Indira 

 Gandhi had put in place during her time in office. The former 

 prime minister understood the importance of the tiger at 

 the top of the food chain and believed, without a shred 

 of doubt, that forests had to be nurtured and protected. 

 She did not need to be told or informed about the consequences 

 of the reduction of forest cover. She was even available 

 to field directors who were facing a problem regarding the 

 task at hand. This kind of commitment is absent in the present 

 crop of leaders. The tiger, and what it symbolizes, are 

 considered to be less important than the precious vote banks. 

 However, now that the United States 

 of America has declared that India is critical to the world 

 at large, we too have begun to talk in their language. This 

 is essentially the sad truth we cannot think of ourselves 

 as leaders and stay ahead of the rest. 

 Hopefully, the cabinet will finally 

 look beyond the obvious and take some right decisions regarding 

 the environment, which has been relegated to the back-burner 

 so far. The prime minister should host a screening of Al 

 Gores film, An Inconvenient Truth, for his colleagues. 

 It is a film that is simple to understand and frightening 

 to behold. It tells us that it is time to get real.

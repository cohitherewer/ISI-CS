 Pretty pictures

 Imagine a tiny boutique on the ground floor of a tall building. This is the Masters Collection art gallery, complete with a large glass front and a young receptionist at the desk. The Small is beautiful exhibition (March 1-26) had miniature and medium-sized works placed from wall to wall, from ceiling to the ground, with hardly any floor space to stand and stare. The majority of the paintings depicted faces or masks (by Suhas Roy, Shanu Lahiri, Beena Pradhan, Bratin Khan, Manik Kandar, Manoj Mitra, Sanatan Dinda, Subrata Gangopadhyay). There were also landscapes (by Prokash Karmakar, Isha Mahammad, Arnab Mukherjee), cityscapes (by Parag Adhikary, Somenath Maity), devotional icons (Shuvaprasanna, Chanchal Mukherjee, Suman Roy), animal drawings (Samir Aich). Most masters seem to be busy churning out pretty pictures. Oil paints, evidently, have become an endangered medium.

 Sandip Sarkar

 Not without blemishes

 Manali Bose, disciple of Pandit Arun Bhaduri, presented khayals in raga Puriya at the Sandr Hall, Calcutta School of Music, on March 24. She began with the well-known vilambit composition in ektaal, Ae piya gunavanta, improvising in the mandra saptak for a while. The intricate movements between the gandhar and the nishad in this octave, punctuated by pithy phrases and longer meends, evoked the characteristic heaviness of the raga. However, Manali did not sustain this gravitas. Before long she concluded the vistar, somewhat hastily, and moved into intricate sargams and taans, which, though ingeniously woven, were not always pleasant on the ear. There were even some sad attempts at heavy gamaks, in the manner of the late Ustad Amir Khan. She followed up with khayals in Nand, which, though better sung, were not free from the blemishes evident in her earlier presentation.

 Somak Ghoshal

 Mixed offering

 Rajrishi Mukherjees first solo exhibition of paintings at the Birla Academy of Fine Arts, which concluded on March 18, featured several oils and sketches by the artist. While the sketches were modest, the oils included strikingly large canvases. Mukherjee seems to be more at ease with landscapes and portraits rather than abstract subjects, which appear somewhat contrived. He also needs to extend the range of his subjects in order to lend depth and variety to his work.

 MELT DOWN

 All it took to unleash a bloodbath in the global markets were a few rumours doing the rounds at the Shanghai bourse. At least, that is the ostensible trigger. The real reasons, however, are easier to spot. Since 2003, a tsunami of liquidity has swept over markets across the globe, pushing asset prices to new highs in places as far apart as New York, Shanghai and Mumbai. In a globalized world, we have a global stock market. From time to time, however, doubts have been aired about the sustainability of the boom. The first jitters were felt in May 2004, when the United States of America first started to talk about increasing interest rates. In the Indian market, which, like all other emerging markets, is closely correlated to the US market, there was, at that time, the additional fear factor of the coming to power of a left-supported government. After a pause, however, the bull run continued. Similar bouts of nervousness appeared in April 2005, October 2005 and May 2006. 

 Although the reasons that triggered the correction were different, the underlying fear was that the present system was inherently unstable. For how long, reasoned the critics, could the US continue to run up huge current account deficits, the result of debt-fuelled consumption, while countries like China and India accumulate vast amounts of dollars as foreign exchange reserves? These dollars go back to the US, where they depress interest rates and enable consumers to continue with their buying spree, and the cycle continues. Worries about a messy unwinding of these global imbalances lie at the heart of these market meltdowns. There are also other concerns, such as the exponential growth of hedge funds and exotic derivative instruments. Very often, the result of such financial engineering is an ability to take on larger amounts of debt, which add to the instability. There are also worries about tightening global liquidity, which will increase the cost of borrowing and lead to an unwinding of leveraged trades.

 On the other hand, there are also those who argue that globalization has helped keep inflation down because manufacturing and certain services have moved to low-cost locations around the globe. That, in turn, allows central banks to be less wary about loosening their monetary purse strings. In other words, the party can go on longer. As far as the Indian market is concerned, it is heavily dependent on foreign liquidity. At the same time, valuations are very high, making it one of the most expensive markets. And the higher you go, the harder you fall. It may be too early to say whether the current fall is the beginning of a new bear phase in the markets. What cannot be disputed is that the Indian market badly needed a correction.

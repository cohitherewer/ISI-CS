 MURDER, FOLLOWED 

 BY MAYHEM 

 -The targeting of migrants would cripple Assam economically 

 MATTER OF FACT

 It is sad that there exists, among 

 the large majority of the peace-loving people of Assam, 

 the misguided men of the Ulfa who are bent upon disturbing 

 peace by their indiscriminate killings. Hundreds have been 

 butchered in repeated instances of violence since the new 

 year. These appear to be part of a premeditated plan of 

 ethnic cleansing. The targets are innocent migrants who 

 have come to the state in search of menial jobs for which 

 adequate manpower was not available locally. 

 The north-eastern states, with 

 their high rate of literacy, face a shortage of labour. 

 The nearby state of Bihar, with its grinding poverty, happens 

 to be an ideal source of labour supply. A majority of the 

 unskilled factory hands, construction and brick-kiln workers, 

 milk and vegetable vendors, rickshaw pullers, washer-men, 

 cobblers and so on, who eke out a living in Assam, are from 

 Bihar. The targeting of this section could disrupt the day-to-day 

 economic activity in Assam.

 In this age of globalization, 

 migration of skilled and unskilled labour, from one place 

 to another, not only within the country but also to overseas 

 locations, has become an economic necessity. Assam has an 

 immense economic potential that is waiting to be exploited 

 for the benefit of its inhabitants. As new industries come 

 up in the state, there will arise an inescapable demand 

 for additional manpower. The region has a great scope for 

 gas-based power plants, petro-chemical, oil-refining, paper, 

 agro- and forest-based enterprises. Once special economic 

 zones come up in Assam, these will naturally attract more 

 migrants from other parts of the country. But will Assam 

 be able to continue on the path of economic progress if 

 outsiders are driven out of Assam by frequent killing sprees? 

 Where will the state meet the 

 increased demand for manpower? From Bangladesh? Already, 

 Bangladeshi migrants have flooded the region in millions. 

 Their presence has not only heightened communal tension, 

 but also endangered national security. The striking down 

 of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act 

 has made detection and deportation of illegal Bangladeshi 

 migrants difficult.

 The propaganda against settlers 

 has triggered a fear pyschosis in the local population of 

 being eventually outnumbered by the migrants. But the state 

 government is free to frame suitable laws in order to ensure 

 political domination of local residents, the pre-eminence 

 of the Assamese language, culture and way of life. In the 

 prevailing environment of insecurity, the state will neither 

 be able to attract capital inflows nor progress.

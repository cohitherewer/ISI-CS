 Unlawful deeds

 Sir NDTVs sting operation investigating the BMW hit-and-run case reveals an unpleasant, though not entirely unfamiliar, aspect of the Indian legal system (BMW case gets push towards justice, June 1). In the past few years, there have been several cases of the rich and the powerful going scot-free even after committing reprehensible crimes. The Jessica Lal murder comes readily to mind. Justice in Jessicas case, as in the BMW incident, was held up for a long time because the investigating agencies, prosecution and defence lawyers were complicit in delaying the course of justice. 

 The rot that has set into the judicial system is too deep now; it would not go away even if the public prosecutor is removed from the BMW case. Moreover, an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation would be of little help, considering that the probe would be carried under government directives. In that case, R.K. Anand, who is an active member of the Congress, would probably escape unhurt. Despite all these double-dealings, one hopes that justice will untimately prevail and Sanjeev Nanda and the others accused would be punished severely.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The revelation of the vicious nexus between the prosecution and defence lawyers involved in the BMW case comes as a huge shock. If highly-paid, nationally-reputed lawyers can be involved in foul play of this kind, one shudders to imagine the extent to which justice is manipulated in ordinary criminal cases. It goes without saying that these erring lawyers should be brought to justice as soon as possible. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir NDTV deserves praise for carrying out the sting operation involving Sunil Kulkarni, prime witness in the BMW case, and the prosecution and defence lawyers. It has once again exposed the loopholes in our judicial system. It is incredible how easily witnesses can be bought and the outcome of a case influenced. It is even more shameful that renowned lawyers like R.K. Anand and I.U. Khan could be so easily lured away from the path of justice. If this is the example senior lawyers set, who would the younger lawyers look up to? How can we ever trust the legal system in this country again? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is heartening to know that Sunil Kulkarni has decided to testify against Sanjeev Nanda and his associates in the BMW hit-and-run case of 1999. But I wonder why it took him eight years to make up his mind. If he really saw the BMW driven by Sanjeev Nanda running over six people, then he should have stuck to the truth. What troubles me most is this: almost all the hit-and-run cases involving powerful people are eventually brought to some out-of-court settlement, and the victims of these accidents and their families are never heard of again. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The sting operation carried out by NDTV that exposed the connivance between the prosecution and defence lawyers in the BMW case seems to be the most effective method for bringing the truth to light. It seems likely that very soon investigative journalism will replace police investigations. The latter have been more prone to blunders than to success in such high-profile cases. Perhaps the huge sums of money on offer against the subversion of justice also has a big role to play. People in trouble should henceforth go to the news channels, and not to the police and the court of law.

 Yours faithfully, 

 S.P. Ghosal,

 Sir Coming in the wake of the BMW controversy, the acquittal of Amit Jogi, son of the former chief minister of Chhattisgarh, Ajit Jogi, and the prime accused in the murder of Avtar Singh Jaggi in 2003, raises some questions. Understandably, Congress leaders feel that justice has been done to Jogi. But what is the value of justice in a country like India, where, time and again, the wealthy and powerful buy their freedoms after committing the most violent crimes? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir In response to Mukul Kesavans article, Inconsistently liberal (May 31), I feel impelled to ask the question: why do the so-called liberal artists find so much pleasure in drawing nude gods and goddesses? Are they running short of subjects? An artist of any moral and creative integrity would not need to pull off such cheap tricks to draw attention to himself. Mischief-making of this sort reflects nothing but a juvenile and immature temperament. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Asoke C. Banerjee, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir Mukul Kesavans views on liberal behaviour are laudable. There is nothing that can legally justify the arrest of the teacher and the student of M.S. University, Vadodara. In a country, where the Constitution boasts of freedom of expression, such atrocities are to be condemned. However, the protest by the countrys leading intellectuals against the arrest of Chandra Mohan would have been more meaningful were they to act, generally, in a more balanced way. Kesavan correctly points out the reflexive tendency among liberal Indians to single out the Hindu Right: they appear to be programmed to protest at the slightest provocation offered by the right-wing Hindus. With certain other religions, the liberals obviously use their discretion because they are sensitive to the human costs of being blind to the repercussions of offending minority groups. Before we start defending freedom of speech and action on ethical grounds, we should also try to imagine the consequences of such freedom within the social context of our country.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Ashok Kumar Ghosh, 

 Calcutta

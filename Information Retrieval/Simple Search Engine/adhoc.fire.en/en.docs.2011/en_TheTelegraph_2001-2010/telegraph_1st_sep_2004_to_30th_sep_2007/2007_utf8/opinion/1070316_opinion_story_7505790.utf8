 A MODERN READERS GUIDE TO STORM SIGNALS

 Sarai Reader 06: Turbulence

 Centre for the Study of Developing Societies,

 Rs 350

 The introduction to Sarai Reader 06 an anthology 

 of essays, critical writing and image-text assemblage 

 starts with an interesting anecdote. Towards the end of 

 the World Cup final, Zinedine Zidane, in one mad moment, 

 headbutted an Italian opponent. The world changed at that 

 moment, at least for the French supporters. Zidane, on whom 

 rested the hopes of a second French triumph, was given the 

 marching orders and the Italians went on to win the trophy. 

 Around the same time, and in the days that followed, other 

 turbulent events went on to touch even a greater number 

 of lives. There were bomb blasts in Mumbai trains, a war-ravaged 

 Lebanon, and the sea-claimed lives in Java once again. These 

 are but a few examples of our turbulent times and the Sarai 

 Reader is both an attempt to examine turbulence as 

 a global phenomenon and an investigation of all that is 

 in the throes of a terminal crisis.

 The Sarai essays show that turbulence is complex and many-layered. There are different kinds of turbulence political, cultural, urban and sexual and modern society experiences each of these, at different levels. 

 The first section opens with R. Krishnas essay, which locates turbulence within the idea of transition, a position he shares with Gramsci. The crisis consists precisely in the fact, wrote Gramsci, that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear. Rene Green, an artist, traces the genesis of turbulence in the struggle to represent history, including that which is partially buried. Cdric Vincent further extends Greens theme of invisibility to interpret conspiracy theories and argue that a globalized world, divided between the rich and the poor, stirs up fear among the dispossessed, invisible sections, which view their powerlessness as a plot hatched by the West.

 Weather Report, which follows the opening section, includes writings that reflect on natural catastrophes. Gyan Prakash looks back on the deluge in Mumbai, a flood that put modernity itself into question. In another part of the world, Legier Biederman rediscovers New Orleans as a city that survived a hurricane to remain beautiful.

 Individual responses to turbulence are as varied as its forms. Each response, however, shares a common trait: the new technologies employed to communicate during crisis. Blogs helped collate information on tsunami victims, while streamline, an online initiative, aimed at bridging the communication gap between a war-torn Iraq and the rest of the world.

 A few essays attempt to address the question of experiencing tumultuous change. Playing Wild, by Andreas Broeckmann, explores the intersections among art, technology and wildness. The last, Broeckmann writes, refers to associations that threaten collective stability and create its own turbulent resonance. Parismita Singhs graphic novel about a college girls experience of surviving an unfriendly, though unspecified, Indian city and its malevolent institutions, is an enjoyable offering. 

 Close encounters extends the theme of witnessing turbulence further. It includes personal records of political discord. Tarun Bhartiya writes about what it is like to live in the North-east, a land squeezed between India and anti-India. Walid Raad reflects on the futility of violence in Beirut, while Bismillah Gillanis essay recounts the trauma of being a Kashmiri Muslim in Delhi.

 Turbulence is not constrained by space or time. It is a continuum, bridging the past and the present, history with geography. The fall of Jhansi during the 1857 uprising, the bloodshed that followed Direct Action Day in Calcutta, the stormy birth of Bangladesh, and the present-day politics of border-control in Europe are all part of the same chain. 

 Nor is turbulence just external. It can be felt within ourselves, inside our bodies. Gautam Bhan looks into sexual chaos, and suggests that the practice of imposing identifiable labels for various sexual identities is an attempt to stave off such chaos. Even physical space our cities has not been spared of disquiet. Nanglas Delhi, for instance, exposes the ugly and tragic faces of urban displacement. 

 The media face their own kind of turbulence too. Nancy Adajanias brilliant piece shows how television in India, while making claims of being a free space, re-enacts the rules laid down by the State. Another contributor, Tushar Dhara, revisits the Khushboo controversy to prove that the print media has become a platform for the playing out of cultural faultlines within gender, religion and Indian regionalism.

 The Sarai Reader is not a pleasant book to read. It is not meant to be one. It raises uncomfortable questions and is unrelenting in its examination of the clamour around us. But this also happens to be the books real strength. It is one of those rare works that has the courage to stare unflinchingly at ugly truths.

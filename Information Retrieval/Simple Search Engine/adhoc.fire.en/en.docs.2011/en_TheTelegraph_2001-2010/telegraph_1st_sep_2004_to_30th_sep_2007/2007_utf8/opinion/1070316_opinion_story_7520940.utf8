 THREE CHEERS FOR GOA 

 Malvika Singh

 BONA FIDE 

 Despite the fact that those who 

 govern us, who determine and execute archaic policies, who 

 consciously dampen the spirit and entrepreneurial energies 

 of Indians, who are themselves stuck in a time warp, this 

 country is moving. It is ignoring the authorities and making 

 good. Back in Goa, you never see a semblance of poverty 

 you jostle with in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, where the authorities 

 are caught up with illegalities, where infrastructure is 

 as pathetic as in other parts of the country. Contrarily, 

 this Union territory has, till now, managed to remain less 

 affected by malgovernance despite the horse-trading and 

 ping-pong politics. Small wonder that those who have made 

 money through hard work, who want a home away from the horrors 

 of mainland India, are frantically looking for homes in 

 the laidback villages of this erstwhile Portuguese colony.

 Dabolim airport is buzzing. There 

 was a time in the not-so-distant past when Goa was teeming 

 with back-packers, looking for cheap and cheerful locales 

 to hang out. Today you see this kind on some of the beach 

 fronts. They have been overtaken by high-end travelling 

 Indians who bring their families and retainers on holiday, 

 flying together on cheap fares. They are either holidaying 

 or looking for land to build on, that is, if they have not 

 already found an old, abandoned Goan home in the village 

 to restore and adopt. Driving around the many villages, 

 particularly in the north of Goa, one can see a marked change. 

 There is an upgradation of the environment, buildings are 

 being restored both their faades and their interiors 

 keeping the original design intact and giving the material 

 space a new lease of life.

 Charming place

 In many ways, inland Goa is far 

 more interesting than the crowded, unclean, heavily-populated 

 beaches, overflowing with overseas tourists, particularly 

 the Calangute, Candolim, Baga and Anjuna stretch. The backwaters, 

 the undulating land in the Aldona, Tivim and Moira areas, 

 with the river in some parts and the traditional homes along 

 the route, are more enchanting. Saligao, Assagaon, have 

 become home to writers, designers, photographers, who find 

 solace in this civilized land with its churches and temples, 

 its markets and its carnivals and its outstanding cuisine. 

 Goans rarely trespass on the tourist-infested strips. 

 This other and real Goa, peopled 

 with the new generation of old Goa families, interspersed 

 with professionals from all across India who have made the 

 western coast their home, is a treat because it is energetic 

 and getting on with life. And all this in a delightfully 

 relaxed manner.

 The other type of inhabitants 

 is made of the rich and famous in their fantasy palaces, 

 which exist along the same crowded beach or close by. They 

 fly in their private aircraft, stay for a party weekend 

 protected by tall walls, isolated from everything except 

 their personal guards and aquaintances. They are not in 

 Goa, they are at their estate! These self-styled movers 

 and shakers are seen by Goans from outside those towering 

 walls as isolated, insular groupies who venture out on their 

 boats with their predictable guests. They create for the 

 Goans the much-needed fantasy world that helps them to escape 

 from the reality of their lives. But this type neither integrates, 

 nor appears to intrude. 

 And finally, the restoration of 

 the streets and bylanes of Panjim has begun the renewal 

 and transformation of a charming town with its traditional 

 architecture, coloured walls and faades, wrought iron grills, 

 town squares with their eating places and bars, whitewashed 

 churches, and tree-lined boulevards along the river front. 

 Goan pride is alive and kicking and three cheers for that!

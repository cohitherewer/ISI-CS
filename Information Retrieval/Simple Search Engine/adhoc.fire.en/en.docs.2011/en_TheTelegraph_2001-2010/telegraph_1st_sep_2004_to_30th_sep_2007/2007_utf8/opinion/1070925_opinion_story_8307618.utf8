 PASSING A BUCK TOO MANY

 - How Gurvinder Bishnoi and his friends made the media cover 

 the death of a deer

 MAN IN THE MIDDLE

 Gurvinder Bishnoi heard a soft 

 click. Then the phone went dead. He realized that the Delhi-based 

 journalist he had been speaking to had hung up. The year 

 was 1998, and Gurvinder had been telling the scribe that 

 an FIR had been lodged against Salman Khan for hunting a 

 chinkara, an animal revered by the Bishnois. There was strong 

 evidence against the actor, and chances were that he might 

 be jailed for the crime. The script, Gurvinder thought, 

 was perfect for a big story. He hoped that the media would 

 use this incident to raise awareness about conservation.

 But Gurvinder had not bargained 

 for what lay in store. The scribe turned down his request, 

 politely but firmly. This was no story, he was told; in 

 India, the rich and the famous get away with their crimes. 

 So would Salman, the scribe said. The journalists from the 

 electronic media disappointed him even more. One national 

 channel inquired whether Jodhpur had proper hotels to put 

 up its reporting team. Otherwise, the newshounds would be 

 terribly inconvenienced. Another channel told Gurvinder 

 that sending an OB van from Delhi to Jodhpur to cover the 

 death of a deer was an expensive proposition. 

 Gurvinder did not give up though. 

 He, along with some of his friends, approached the local 

 press and furnished evidence. A leading daily broke the 

 story and Gurvinder knew that the silence had been lifted.

 Nine years later, Gurvinder sits 

 in an eerily silent studio in Jodhpurs Akashvani Bhavan. 

 He works as a radio announcer and also runs an NGO, which 

 works towards the protection of wildlife. He smiles a lot 

 while talking, and, like most other men in his community, 

 prefers white clothes. 

 He says that the media is not 

 entirely to blame for the initial indifference. The fault, 

 he says, lies partly with the Bishnois as well.

 The Bishnois have never been numerically 

 significant in Rajasthan. Even today, they dominate four 

 of the eight constituencies only in Jodhpur. The state assembly 

 has just a handful of Bishnoi MLAs. Being a small community, 

 the Bishnois have not been able to act as a significant 

 pressure group and present their case on a larger platform. 

 Moreover, environmental protection has never really been 

 a priority at the level of state policy. This apathy, according 

 to Gurvinder, pervades most institutions, including the 

 media. 

 Gurvinder is also thankful to 

 Salman Khan. The actors stardom, he says, has helped draw 

 attention to the pioneering work done by the Bishnois in 

 the field of environmental conservation. He is not entirely 

 happy with the medias portrayal of the actor though. The 

 papers, he says in a shocked tone, were full of stories 

 about what the actor ate, or how well he slept, and whether 

 or not he was visited by his girlfriend. His discomfort 

 lies in the media sympathizing with a criminal. Such outpourings 

 can be counterproductive, he says, burying the real issue 

 under a whole lot of trivia.

 The next hearing in the Salman 

 Khan case is a month away. But Gurvinder is still thinking 

 of the day of Salmans sentencing by a Jodhpur district 

 court. Twenty OB vans had thronged the court premises, while 

 impatient journalists hounded him for a byte. But behind 

 the flashbulbs and the noise, he knew that there was a story 

 that remained untold. This interview, he hoped, would reveal 

 that hidden tale.

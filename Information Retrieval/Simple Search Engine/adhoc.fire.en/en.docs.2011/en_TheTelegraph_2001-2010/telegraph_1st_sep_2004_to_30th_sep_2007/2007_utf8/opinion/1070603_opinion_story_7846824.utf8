 Breaking with 

 the past

 - What do modern Indians have in common with their ancestors? 

 Telling Tales 

 Amit Chaudhuri

 No living link 

 Bhubaneswar has, at first glance, 

 the provincialism you associate with many capital cities. 

 There are the obscure but important centres of scientific 

 research by the main road, where, presumably, some sort 

 of work on agricultural graft is being done; inside, besides 

 unexplained expanses of emptiness, are the guest houses 

 that survive from the childhood trips you made with your 

 parents. Then there are the new hotels, some of them looking 

 as uninhabited and as much erected for public display as 

 the legislative assembly does in the evening. Theres dust, 

 of course, not far from the obedient grass that surrounds 

 the Caf Coffee Day; and visible stretches of horizon between 

 the hospitals for the rich and the software companies. And, 

 at different altitudes and locations, there are, from nine 

 or ten centuries ago, the temples, their lines and curves, 

 their vertical convergences, the sly referentiality their 

 edifices reveal on closer inspection, unlike anything you 

 have seen anywhere. 

 Like the guest houses with their 

 fans, air conditioners and bathrooms, like the indelible 

 mosquitoes, like the impossible breakfasts inside hotels, 

 like twilight dimming, the temples too are remnants of journeys 

 improvised and undertaken in childhood, part of ones first 

 impressions of a country with its barriers, public warnings 

 and wonders. It was to catch and compare these impressions 

 before they slipped away that, a few months ago, we decided 

 to revisit Bhubaneswar and take our daughter with us who, 

 at eight, was almost the same age as wed been when we, 

 separately, had first toured this part of India with our 

 parents.

 On the first day, we went to the 

 exhibition sites to buy saris, pictures, and gifts; 

 on the second day, we went to Dhaulagiri, then Puri, and, 

 on the way back, a little after half past four, the sun 

 barely beginning its descent, stopped at Konark to enter 

 the temple that had been built to honour its timeless vanishings 

 and reappearances. We were immediately beset by the ancillary 

 industry that attended the place: an auto driver who would 

 save us lazy, well-heeled tourists the walk, and a guide 

 who could explain to us the facets of the temple in either 

 Oriya, or Hindi, or even Bengali. 

 Three months later, my memory 

 of Konark is a memory of an intricate structure in light 

 and space, but also, as I see myself gauging the suns progress 

 from the relics of neighbouring doorways, and moving from 

 podium to podium, stairway to stairway, as something that 

 contains light and space and concealed angles, like a kaleidoscope. 

 In the midst of this are the several combinations of lovemaking: 

 monogamous; adulterous; orgiastic; bestial; gymnastic; putting 

 to use anal and oral orifices; involving crowds and cooperation; 

 interrupted rudely by spouses and children. Only male homosexuality 

 was missing from the array, and the missionary position; 

 but, given the physical heights at which some of the figures 

 were executed, solely, it seemed, for the sculptors pleasure, 

 I might have well overlooked some of that at once tranquil 

 and obsessed activity. 

 My guide, short, unshaven, in 

 endlessly laundered white shirt and white trousers, drew 

 my attention to a small panel in stone consisting of three 

 eroded but resistant figures. See, the wife is angry with 

 the husband for taking another woman; whats wrong with 

 me, shes asking, he said in his efficient but not always 

 comprehensible mix of Oriya and Bengali. After this, many 

 of the other panels fell into place for me. My guide would 

 delicately leave my wife and daughter staring, wonderstruck 

 and bored respectively, at a horse or a wheel, and, beckoning 

 to me, gesture towards a frieze: See how hes lifted her 

 off the ground; there are advantages to women being light, 

 or, pointing at three interconnected figures, See, all 

 of them are busy. I was uneasy at these solemn observations, 

 their general accuracy, and at this surreptitious camaraderie; 

 and yet I savoured them too. But I wished to communicate 

 these astonishments to my wife, and, at once, keep my daughter 

 from noticing them; as, obviously, Id once failed to notice 

 them while my parents, two people both known and entirely 

 unknown to me, had walked around the temple. 

 But, when I think back to that 

 afternoon, or of the booklet of postcard-sized, rather poor 

 reproductions of some of the more bizarre postures carved 

 into the stone which I bought for fifteen rupees on our 

 way out when I think back to these images, Im far more 

 unsettled by the unrecognizability of the culture that produced 

 them than by their unbridled sexual fervour. Its one thing 

 to read about the sexual abandon of our antiquity; its 

 another to stand in the same space in which that abandon 

 was imagined and possibly enacted; and yet another to come 

 face to face, close-up, with the otherness of the past, 

 with the compelling and difficult strangeness of our ancestors. 

 For weve more or less absorbed and interiorized wholly 

 the story we were taught in school: that we are the progeny 

 of our glorious history. Moreover, India possesses the one 

 living culture, were told, that still has links with 

 its ancient heritage; in this, were quite unlike our Greek 

 contemporaries. Orientalist scholarship, with local assistance, 

 amassed the materials of our antiquity; and colonial archaeologists 

 put together the jigsaw-puzzle fragments of our temples. 

 We by which I mean educated Indians from two hundred years 

 ago to today imagined, most importantly of all, our relationship 

 to our forefathers, and saw the living link.

 Just as Western scholars, in the 

 19th century, constructed for themselves an inexorable and 

 inevitable lineage going back to the ancient Greeks, our 

 own writers and historians created, upon the foundation 

 provided by the Orientalists, their versions of an unbroken 

 line going back to the old kingdoms, to the Buddha, to the 

 treatises on the arts, and further back, to the incursion 

 of the Aryans and to Harappa. This was, in effect, the first 

 great history composed for a subject race, and, despite 

 similarities to its Western counterpart, had modulations 

 appropriate to the context of subjecthood and nationalism 

 (while the Western tradition is developmental, and a story 

 of increasing secularization, our forefathers, in many ways, 

 are more liberal, more monotheistic, more refined than we 

 are). 

 Its because of the way weve 

 chosen our relationship to our past that our ancestors can 

 come to our rescue, with their Olympian sophistication, 

 again and again in the wake of the extreme right-wing war 

 with Art. And it is right, and our right, to summon them 

 in this way. And yet its also right to attend to the moment 

 of disjunction, such as I experienced at Konark, between 

 our world and our ancestors, and to pursue the implications 

 of that disjunction for the way we imagine history. Our 

 forefathers are not ourselves; they are not proto-cosmopolitans, 

 proto-liberals, or even proto-postcolonials. Those figures 

 in stone not only confirm to us what we are, as nationalism 

 does; they alienate us from ourselves. Some such experience 

 of disjunction on seeing the icons of the 14th-century painter, 

 Andrei Rublov (from almost the same era, then, as the sculptors 

 of Konark), obviously troubled the Russian filmmaker, Tarkovsky, 

 himself very much a European beholden to the art of the 

 Renaissance; yet the mask-like icons, so lacking in the 

 humane consciousness that suffuses post-Renaissance faces 

 in painting as water does a rag, led Tarkovsky to dwell 

 compulsively on what was alien in his own heritage, and 

 to make a great film, the eponymous Andrei Rublov, 

 interrogating the usual conflation between European and 

 Russian identities.

 Some such intuition of disjunction, 

 and its importance, is expressed by Tagore in his great 

 essay on the Meghadutam, where, mesmerized by Kalidasa 

 and the mandakranta metre, he remarks that an eternal 

 gulf separates us from ancient India, a gulf as absolute 

 as the one between Kalidasas narrator and the Yaksha. 

 This isnt just an expression of decline, such as the one 

 on which 19th-century nationalism built itself, but an acknowledgement 

 of cultural estrangement, of history opening us out on to 

 otherness. But, in his public persona, Tagore shaped for 

 himself a role that looks like a natural and seamless extension 

 of the inheritance given him by antiquity. An altogether 

 different version of this contradiction can be found, more 

 recently, in Amartya Sens The Argumentative Indian, 

 where he truculently answers Western historicism by pointing 

 out that the Greeks had little in common, after all, with 

 the Goths and Visigoths. This seems entirely true; and yet, 

 when he comes to our secular modernity, and in the process 

 of uncovering its sources, Sen fashions a thesis that takes 

 us back to the various stages of our past; untroubled by 

 the possibility of an ambivalent reply to the same question: 

 What do we have in common with our ancestors? And yet 

 that other world, were we to let it speak, would surely 

 have something to tell us.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 When the going gets hot

 P. Chidambaram has been under fire, ever since he came out with a lacklustre budget. And the brickbats continue. The finance minister found his head on the block with the Congress blaming him for the debacle in Punjab. Recently, the FM was cornered by the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, while his allies sat back and enjoyed the show. A Congressman was heard saying that it was time for Chidambaram to take some tips from Lalu Prasad, who had worked wonders with the rail budget. As if on cue, an MP from the Rashtriya Janata Dal pointed out that while Chidambaram had studied at Harvard, the RJD boss was now on his way to teach at this prestigious university. With allies poking fun at the FM, surely the opposition could not be expected to wait and watch silently. Yashwant Sinha, former finance minister, joined in the fray with this stinger: Yeh to aam kutte ko bhi relief nahi de saka. The budget, in Singhs words, only provided succour to canines with pedigree.

 Another man who burnt his fingers is Rahul Gandhi. His indirect barb at PV Narasimha Rao over the Babri Masjid demolition has not gone down well with Congressmen who were close to Rao. As usual, after the blip, the stage was set for a damage control exercise. Madam herself reportedly instructed the media cell to clarify that the crown princes statements were not directed against any one individual. But rumblings continue in the Congress, an ominous sign before the crucial UP polls. The BJP, however, seems to be in no position to take advantage of this unrest in the rival camp. In fact, the mood is rather subdued, even though things are hotting up in UP. Apparently, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has decided to give the partys poll campaign a slip for the time being. Spin doctors in the BJP were quick to allay fears that Vajpayees refusal was on grounds of his ill health, and not because of his reported unhappiness with faulty ticket distribution. Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley have been instructed to lead the charge at a rally in Kanpur. The party has also pressed into service a fleet of helicopters to add colour to the campaign. Perhaps, the BJP need not have tried so hard. The controversy over Rahul Gandhis comments has already taken the wind out of the Congresss sails.

 Meanwhile, Arun Nehru, Rajiv Gandhis trusted number two man, is reportedly on a comeback trail in the Congress. Ever since he fell out with Rajiv, Nehru had been living a quiet life, occasionally writing columns in newspapers. His stint with the BJP was also a disappointment, when he failed to win the elections on a party ticket. Now, one hears that the ice is about to be broken between the Gandhis and Nehru. The Gandhis, one hears, have realized that they need Aruns man-management skills and backroom expertise to do well in UP. As for Arun, he is ready to put the bitter past behind him and regain the loyalty of the first family. Such a move will certainly put an end to Aruns political sanyas. But will it also help the Congress regain the turf in UP?

 Arjun Singh, the old Congress war horse, is facing a crisis at home. His grandson, Aishwariya, got married to Devyani, the Nepali princess who is Jyotiraditya Scindias cousin. But two of the grooms uncles, Ajay and Abhimanyu, were conspicuous by their absence. Ajay was reportedly busy with a by-poll while Abhimanyu, one heard, had not even been invited. But, as is the rule in such cases, there lies a tale within a tale. Ajay, according to insiders, has teamed up with Digvijay Singh to take over the reigns of the Congress in Madhya Pradesh, much to Scindias chagrin. But the biggest spoke in Ajays wheels happens to be his father. Arjun Singh advised his son to go slow with his plans as the family was now related to the Scindias through marriage. Singh senior, it seems, was unwilling to embarrass his bahu. Singh, it can now be said, is as good a father-in-law as a politician.

 Post Nandigram, the Buddha has stopped smiling. It is not only the opposition that is baying for his blood after fourteen people were killed in police firing in Nandigram. What is worse, cracks have also appeared in the coalition which has held on to power for thirty long years in the state. Take, for example, what happened when the Communist Party of India (Marxist) deputed a clutch of left MPs to douse the flames. Even while the likes of Mohammad Salim and Hannan Mollah parried questions from the media, Abani Roy of the RSP, a left ally, commented that only two Buddhas have been born in this country. While one was the epitome of non violence, the other, Roy added, has come to resemble violence and bloodshed.

 Jee huzuri can take you a long way in politics. To test this hypothesis, one has to only look at our netas, the young and the old. Most of them stand up with folded hands and bowed heads whenever a supreme leader passes by, usually without even bothering to cast a second glance. Just look at what happened the other day. Sonia Gandhi was walking up to her office situated in the inner ring of parliament house. And sure enough, the lot of Congressmen present, immediately switched to their worshipping mode, and stood up from their seats. Of course, Madam hurried by, ignoring this show of respect. The men took their seats only after she was gone. To be fair to them, one has to say that the Akalis, RJD and DMK MPs too stand tall whenever Dayanidhi Maran, Sukhbir Badal or Lalu Prasad are in sight. The only exception happen to be members of the Left and the BJP. Now, is that because some of their MPs are too old to be on their feet for long?

 INDIA ADVANCES

 Although good growth has become rather common recently in India, the latest figures are worth more than a yawn. Growth of 9.4 per cent in the gross domestic product, in the financial year 2006-07, has been widely reported; but it has not been noticed that gross national product increased by 9.6 per cent, and net national product by 9.9 per cent in other words, it nearly touched 10 per cent. The difference between domestic and national product is income from abroad. Its chief element is remittances of Indians working abroad; but apparently, investments abroad of Indian companies have also begun to pay off. Choleric leftists will continue to excoriate companies for not investing and creating jobs at home; but the rest of us can cheer Indian capitalists buying up businesses abroad and bringing back profits. 

 The prime ministers economic council had asserted almost a year ago that the present boom was led by consumption. The new figures give a lie to this claim; the share of gross fixed investment in national income went up from 25.2 to 27.9 per cent in the past two years. The difference between gross and net national product is depreciation of capital assets. The slight fall in the share of depreciation from 10.2 per cent to 9.8 per cent in the past two years is due to the fact that the capital stock is growing rapidly. The fact is that this is an investment-led boom; the investment would add to capacity as demand rises. The implicit inflation was 4.5 per cent a year ago and 5.3 per cent in the past year. It went up slightly, but was lower than what the wholesale price index showed. The GDP deflator is far more comprehensive, hence a more reliable indicator of inflation; it shows less cause for alarm. It is to be hoped that the Reserve Bank of India will read these figures and bring down its level of panic about inflation. It has tried its best in the past year to damage growth by raising interest rates and strangling money supply. Fortunately, till now it has not been able to inflict much damage; let us hope that its urge to hurt will subside now. 

 The new figures are likely to make the government even more complacent. It has been the belief of the prime minister that the current boom is due to the reforms made by him 16 years ago and the sagacity he has shown after returning to power in 2004, and that his government is enjoying the just rewards of past virtue. The belief is partly responsible for his failure to achieve significant reforms in his latest phase. The brilliant growth figures will add further comfort to his state of mind. That is a pity, but it is better by far to have lively growth with a dormant government than the other way round.

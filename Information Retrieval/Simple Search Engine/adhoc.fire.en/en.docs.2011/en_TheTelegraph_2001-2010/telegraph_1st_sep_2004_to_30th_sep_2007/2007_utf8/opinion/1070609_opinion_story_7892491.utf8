 BONES MINUS THE FLESH

 Ananda Lal

 THEATRE

 Why would anyone want to compress Ibsens masterpieces into ninety minutes or less? The minence grise of modern drama meticulously chiselled them into such jewels that condensation amounts to just getting the plots right, and sacrifices the depth of characterization that gives his plays their sinewy strength. We can excuse Natyaswapnakalpa for conceiving of this tribute to Ibsen as part of their annual event because it is a festive variety show, but for three participating groups to revive their entries as one evenings regular bill at Sujata Sadan is ill-advised. Those who declined to take part may actually be wiser. 

 Swapnasandhanis Maydanab, Nirbak Abhinay Academys Dulali and Arshis Putuler Chithi achieve one thing, though: they provide the viewer who has zero knowledge of Ibsen with an acceptable crash course in Ibsenism. Thus, Putuler Chithi delivers an unusually univocal Dolls House, the 1879 classic that everyone should have read or seen, epitomizing his trailblazing realism. Dulali Indianizes The Wild Duck (1884), typical of Ibsens intermediary symbolical phase. And Maydanab adapts The Master Builder (1892), representative of his late expressionism. A rich sweep of modernist styles from the hands of the same author. 

 Bibhash Chakraborty rewrites Dolls House as Putuler Chithi, an epistolary monologue by Nora relating her story. That is precisely the problem, for it becomes one-sided; we do not hear from their own mouths the opinions of Torvald or the others that Ibsen had crafted so well. Besides, by facilely leaving the children out of consideration, the director, Abanti Chakraborty, simplifies Noras decision to depart. Senjuti Mukhopadhyays excellent shift from an apparently nave Nora to the mature individual cannot compensate for these defects. 

 Suranjana Dasgupta sets Dulali in a Sikh family, which works reasonably well, except for the fact that everyone but she manages a Punjabi accent, reflecting poorly on her self-direction. Again, owing to the abridgment, she necessarily has to omit several characters and confine the locale to one house. 

 One expected a fuller treatment of The Master Builder from Kaushik Sen, who directs Tarapada Rays translation titled Maydanab. Ibsens original is a brilliant portrait of the artist as an old man. In this he excoriated himself both as an artist and as a human being, dramatizing his supposed infatuation with a young woman and his guilty feelings towards his ailing wife. At the same time, it is highly relevant in todays promoter raj, asking whether architecture is art or business, creative or accretive, while the master architect faces the challenge to his position from upcoming talents. Having chopped much of the meat off Ibsens dialogue, Sen can present only the bare bones.

 HOW NOT TO GET ACTS TOGETHER

 Ananda Lal

 Theatre

 Contrary to what some cynical readers think, most critics dont write their reviews before the event. But I must confess that when I learnt of Theatrecians new project, Edward Albees The Goat (picture), my first line came to mind well in advance, inspired by Captain Haddocks immortal imprecation to Professor Calculus, Theatrecian should stop acting The Goat. I had figured that despite considerable experience, the young company couldnt possibly do justice to Albees Tony Award-winner of 2002. After watching it, though, I realized that such a premeditated start wouldnt do justice to a courageous effort on a difficult recent play.

 The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?, finds the 79-year-old shocking audiences as much as he used to four decades ago. The play resurrects themes and techniques from his early career: sudden violence erupting in an apparently normal family as in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, the absurdism of animals relating to humans as in Seascape, an unexpectedly grisly end as in The Zoo Story. The warm laughter with which we greet the discovery of the protagonists caprine love gradually freezes over as we comprehend that Albee is discussing bestiality clinically. Besides the absurdist and realistic levels, we can also interpret the goat to symbolize anyones obsessive attachment to anything.

 Theatrecian overcomes the challenge of enacting three characters double the age of the cast members. Deborshi Barat is the most convincing as the friend who betrays the trust placed in him, Dhruv Mookerji grows into his role as the bewildered husband, Ronjini Chakraborty portrays his shell-shocked wife with grit, and Tathagata Chowdhury plays perfectly the part of their gay teenage son. But they make the mistake of not appointing a director. Without that unifying vision, the production has an unfinished quality. For instance, Chakraborty faces the spectators frontally far too often whereas the others dont. Similarly, the impeccably symmetrical furniture, unlike in any ordinary home, shows the absence of a set designer.

 While Theatrecian forges ahead with such intractable, controversial material, Calcuttas other English-language troupes seem content to mark time. Spotlights Simply Simon simply simplifies two of Neil Simons full-length works into one act each, shortchanging viewers. Doubly misguided, Spotlight, like Theatrecian, decides not to have a director.

 It begins with the third and last act of The Last of the Red-Hot Lovers, in which a happily-married man, desperately trying to have a fling, has a go at one for the third time. Arya Gupta messes up his lines atrociously despite loud prompting, but Rajshree Gaggar as his nervous date proves yet again that her talent should not go to waste on such trifles. Theatregoers interested in this comedy can profitably see the full version in Brainchilds Late Lateef, a Hindi interpretation of Sai Paranjpyes Marathi adaptation.

 Next, Spotlight condenses Prisoner of Second Avenue into two short acts, depriving us of the emotional development. However, the instinctive understanding between Rita Roy and Pradip Mitra carries the day as the couple in dire straits resulting from the husbands impending unemployment. How much more satisfying it would have been had they done the complete text.

 Stagecraft, too, appears to have cobbled together four fifteen-minute skits by Frank Gilroy as a new show titled, A Slice of Life, just to ensure its biannual turnover. The entire team looks decidedly tired and disinterested. Only June Pinto impresses as the wife who avenges her spouses affair in Match Point. If Rohit Pombra wanted to direct a Gilroy play, he should have chosen The Subject Was Roses, the only one deserving revival.

 Moving away from these three American dramatists born within three years of one another the newly formed Jinx House felt it could better Theatrecians pedestrian staging of Terry Pratchetts Wyrd Sisters two years ago. They were wrong. I cannot fathom why people in their twenties want to collectively go back to the womb in this manner; and if they do, there are far superior teenage texts to return to. Pratchett is one of the most overrated writers for that age group, and Stephen Briggss dramatization is boring, worthy only of childrens pantomime. It pains me to see intelligent students of Jadavpur University and St Xaviers College like director Debanjan Basak fritter away their energy. The solitary silver lining was an acrobatic and expressive Subhayan Sengupta as Duke Felmet, scraping his hands manically with a hanky, then sandpaper and finally a grater.

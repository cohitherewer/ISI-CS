 FORCED TO THINK

 In India, what do most board examinations examine? Memory, stamina and canniness in predicting questions, rather than the students ability to think critically and in an original manner under pressure. This system runs the risk of producing not only braindead students, but also equally braindead teachers (and private tutors). This sorry state of affairs is now set to change. The Central Board of Secondary Education has announced a change in its philosophy. Students will no longer be encouraged to mindlessly memorize their syllabus. They will have to show signs of being able to think for themselves, from first principles, in their examination papers. This change in pedagogy will be reflected in the abolition of question banks, from which questions used to be fished out every year, enabling students and teachers to guess the questions in each years papers. Preparing for these papers would therefore amount to having the answers ready and spewing them out during the examinations. Nor will students be expected to restate from memory the laws and principles in the sciences. They will be tested on how well they could apply these to practical situations.

 This is a wonderful idea, provided it is backed up by revolutionary changes in teaching methods all over the country, and across the entire range of subjects. Lethargy and inertia will have to go, in both teachers and students, and nothing short of hard work and harder thinking will do. This is likely to cause quite a stir among the entire education system, because so much of it operates on mechanical principles of rote learning, demanding the least time and intellectual effort from those who teach, write textbooks, set the papers, mark the examinations and from those who go through this grind to come out successful or unsuccessful. Private tutors, in particular, will be most put out by this change, for the lucrative mass production of pre-packaged knowledge would be difficult to pull off if this new philosophy is allowed to have its way. Are the West Bengal boards ready for this sort of thing? Not quite, it seems, if their preference for unit tests and multiple-choice questions continues to hold sway. If examinations manage to weed out the non-thinkers from the thinkers, then this could lead to a revolution in higher education that might be too difficult to handle in a system where excellence is the problem rather than the solution.

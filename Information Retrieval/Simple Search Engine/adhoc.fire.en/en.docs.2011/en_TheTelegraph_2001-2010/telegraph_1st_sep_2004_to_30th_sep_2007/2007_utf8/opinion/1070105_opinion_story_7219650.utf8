 Visible and invisible walls

 No Borders: Journeys of an Indian Journalist

 By Mukul Sharma, Daanish, Price not mentioned

 Agood wall makes good neighbours, or so the saying goes. But when the Berlin Wall was brought down on November 9, 1989, a large number of citizens living on both the sides of it burst into celebration. However, within a few years, many new walls came up in the now-unified and apparently-more-powerful Germany. The leaders of the Green Party claim that this is not unification rather it is the control of East by the West. No Borders: Journeys of an Indian Journalist, by Mukul Sharma, explores these un-revealed, un-discussed processes of German unification. Violence is often reported between East and West Germans. And Nazi groups are once again active in West Germany.

 But No Borders is not just a book on the collapse of the Berlin Wall and its impact. In fact, as the name suggests, it is part-reportage and part-research. The pieces explore the radical changes, interventions, popular protests of the common people in large parts of the world. The author, after visiting 14 countries in 15 years, between 1990 and 2005, came to the conclusion that there is not much distinction between the exploiters and exploited, be it in India, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, or elsewhere. Sharma talks about the US, where 80 per cent of drug addicts are whites although the so-called war on drugs are waged on the African-American and Hispanic neighbourhoods. 

 Globally too, the US is less interested in checking the menace within the country and more keen to take on the source countries in Latin America, south Asia, east Europe and Africa. The fact, however, is that the drug lords in these countries used their relationship with the CIA to increase their hold on power. The real victims of this war on drugs are the poor coca and opium growers.

 In Indonesia, the foreign mining investment projects cover all the mineral areas in the country, especially those endowed with gold and coal resources. Similarly, the multi-national oil giant, Shell, while drilling in Nigeria, has devastated a large part in the south of the country, leading to the death of over 1,800 people.

 The book brings to notice the problems of the dock-workers and coalminers of the UK after the privatization of docks in 1989 and coal mines in 1994. The struggle of landless workers of Bihar in India, Nepal and South Africa are also recorded with empathy.

 Various peoples movements against environmental pollution and industrial wastes are covered. There is also an interview with Moula Bux Khaskhili, the president of the All Pakistan Trade Union Organization, revealing how trade union movements in Pakistan have been crushed, at the instance of the World Bank and IMF, by successive governments. Sharma draws attention to the plight of men and women working in the garment industry in Bangladesh. 

 The author also explains how, in the last two decades, a new entrepreneur class has been slowly replacing the traditional fishermen in south India. He attributes the frequent clashes between the fishermen of India and Sri Lanka to the universalizing impact of capital and technology. 

 No Borders focuses essentially on peoples movements. But over in the last 15 years, some struggles have undergone a change, some others have become intensified, while some lost their appeal. As a result, some parts of the book appear somewhat outdated.

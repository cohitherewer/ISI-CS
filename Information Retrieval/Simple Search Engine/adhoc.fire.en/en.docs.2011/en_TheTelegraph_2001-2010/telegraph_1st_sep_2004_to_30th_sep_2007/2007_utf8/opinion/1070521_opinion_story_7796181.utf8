 TWO BUCCANEERS

 Tantis Suzlon Energy has been trying for months to acquire REPower, Germanys leading producer of wind power generators. The prize seemed to be within grasp, but has eluded it till now. Vijay Mallya, on the other hand, has announced a 100 per cent acquisition of Whyte and Mackay, the maker of Isle of Jura and Dalmore Scotch whiskies. Suzlons bid for REPower provoked a counter offer from AREVA, the French constructor and manager of power stations, which already had a significant equity holding in REPower. To outbid AREVA, Suzlon needed more money, which it could not raise from bankers. It sought to raise the money from an equity issue, but its share price has declined so far that the equity finance route is more or less closed now. United Breweries, on the other hand, had no difficulty in raising bank finance required for its offer for Whyte and Mackay.

 Both Suzlon and United Breweries are amongst our most solid companies; the difference in their experience is educative. India has had absurdly high import duties on liquor high enough to raise the price five-and-a-half times; Mr Mallya no doubt lent a hand in keeping them that high, for the chief beneficiary of this protection of the Indian market was United Breweries. The high duties have, however, come under increasingly severe attacks from the major powers, principally the European Union. The wall of protection has looked vulnerable under their attacks. Reading the writing on the wall, Mr Mallya has bought a distillery which will give him a ready source of Scotch, should the wall come tumbling down. The distillery has huge inventories of maturing Scotch, to finance which it had borrowed heavily. The debt weighed down the value of the company; Mr Mallya, sitting on a cash mountain, could buy it at a very sensible price in his own words.

 The financial calculations behind Suzlons bid for REPower were not so obvious. The acquisition of REPower would give Suzlon entry into the European Union market. It would also give it access to REPowers technological knowhow. Europes best sites for wind power, which are mainly in its north-west, are substantially exploited; they gave REPower the bulk of its business till now. Suzlon has not made it very clear what advantage would accrue to it from entry into Europe. Such advantages as there were, were eroded by the rise in valuation following the bidding war with AREVA. No wonder, then, that both its shareholders and financiers have been less than enthusiastic. Without their backing, REPower cannot be acquired, so just now the fate of Suzlons bid is clouded. United Breweries shares, on the other hand, went up on the acquisition of Whyte and Mackay. The market raised a toast to Mr Mallyas clever move clever in terms of rupees, annas and pies. Engineers may make great windmills, but it needs a businessmans brain to turn them into money-spinners.

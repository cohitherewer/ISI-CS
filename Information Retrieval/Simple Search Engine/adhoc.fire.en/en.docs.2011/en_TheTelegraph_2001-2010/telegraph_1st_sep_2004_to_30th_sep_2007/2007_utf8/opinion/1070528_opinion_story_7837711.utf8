The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 OWN GOAL

 India continues to play its silly games with tigers. Exactly two years have passed since the formation of the Tiger Task Force with the prime ministers blessings. The immediate spur for its formation was the heartrending discovery that there were no more tigers on the Sariska Reserve in Rajasthan. Heartrending, but not surprising. The steady decimation of tigers throughout India was never as silent and mysterious as official sources would like to pretend. The flourishing trade in tiger-skins, claws, teeth and organs just across the border has always been a sure indicator of the number of tigers being regularly killed. This is at the most obvious level. The shrinking of habitat because of industrial projects, mines and tourist centres, the alienation and displacement of traditional users of forest produce through these as well as through the fencing off of the reserves, gave less obvious indicators. The task force took on a new, participatory model of conservation, no longer dependent purely on guns and fences. Yet the census in 2007 shows frightening figures. It need not be asked whether the new practices envisaged at the formation of the task force have begun to be implemented. That is irrelevant. It might be relevant instead to start fixing blame.

 But even that argument must begin with a questioning of the premises. Is there anyone in the Central and state governments anywhere in the country actually interested in saving the tiger? If there had been any serious interest in the tiger, and not in the revenue it might generate by being saved and not saved all at the same time, then how is it that no government, no official body, no officer, has ever been brought to account for lies, suppressions and misleading rhetoric? Why have the tiger censuses been so obviously wrong time after time? Will the public be told exactly how much money has been poured in to count and save the tiger in the last 20 years and how that money has been used? What is the role of tiger experts in all this? And, most revealing, why are these questions never answered, or even raised? Losing the tiger, a goal that India is going to reach fairly soon now, will be an achievement of earth-shaking stupidity. This will also mask, successfully, the numbers of other, less famous, less paying, creatures that it is urging towards extinction every day.

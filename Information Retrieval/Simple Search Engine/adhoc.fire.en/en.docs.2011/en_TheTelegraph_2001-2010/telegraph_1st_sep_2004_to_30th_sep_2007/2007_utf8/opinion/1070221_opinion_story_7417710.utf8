The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RIGHT CHOICE

 Not all who enter politics need to abandon hope. Mr Muhammad Yunus has, in fact, raised great expectations in Bangladesh by deciding to float a new political party. Long before he was awarded the Nobel peace prize for making his micro-credit programmes a popular and viable economic model, he had been an icon in his country. It is easy to see why Bangladeshis in general have welcomed his entry into politics. They have been let down badly by the inefficiency, corruption and endless squabbles that mar the countrys politics. The current state of emergency and the postponement of the elections are an outcome of that brand of politics. Someone with Mr Yunuss credentials can radically change the scenario. Or so the people hope. But his decision also raises some larger issues. It may suggest, for instance, that big changes are beyond the scope of non-governmental organizations and that only the State can usher in such changes. While the NGOs have their uses, only political mobilization can help the people on a big scale. 

 There is an even more significant message in Mr Yunuss choice. Votaries of economic liberalization run down politics as redundant. They not only project a dismal, despairing image of politics, but also want to keep economic development out of the political discourse. Also, these cheerleaders for market capitalism have nothing but contempt for the State. Not just politics, everything relating to the State and the government, according to them, is an enemy of economic promise. Mr Yunuss move can have a sobering effect on such extremist views. It should disabuse nave market-worshippers of the notion that politics has no role in economic development. Despite its abuses, democratic politics is the best guarantee of economic and other freedoms.

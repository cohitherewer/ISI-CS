 CREATING THE DESIRED EFFECT

 Sharmila Basu Thakur

 Dance

 In an age of mediocrity, Indian classical dance is probably the worst sufferer. Proper training to understand the idiom, along with an innovative, cerebral approach, is hardly found. Parampara or legacy, which is very vital for any classical art to continue and grow, is lacking nowadays. 

 In such a situation, it is refreshing to come across someone like Souvik Chakraborty (picture), a brilliant Kathak dancer, who is a disciple of Madhumita Roy and has also been nurtured by Birju Maharaj. His performance at Gyan Manch on June 11 was marked by his authentic approach and dedication. The programme was organized by Nrityadisha to celebrate their first anniversary. The two-and-a-half hour presentation proved that classical dance has its own charm and intrinsic merit. The evening began with Shankara Shiva Mahadeva, an invocation to Shiva.

 The participants were earnest and the music had been well-recorded. An intelligent combination of pakhawaj, drums and jhanj created the desired mood to portray the bold characteristics of Shiva. It was followed by Shakti, a number depicted the power of woman. The strength and beauty of the supreme cause of srishti, sthiti and laya were beautifully etched by ten dancers using thaat, chakkars and pure Kathak movements. The appropriate application of raga Kalavati to elaborate subha shakti touched the heart. Debasish Sarkar was not very impressive in his rendition of the stotram. Gravity and grandeur were lacking in his Sanskrit pronunciation.The best part of the programme was a solo Kathak performance by Souvik. He began with Ganesh vandana, followed by traditional numbers of this style. The dancer offered tihai, uthaan, ginti and chakkar in vilambit, madhya and drut teental by blending crisp bols and gentle gliding movements with delicate rhythmic patterns, excellent layakari and neat footwork. The abhinaya chosen from Jaydevs Geetgovind was average. In spite of his improvisation, Souvik could not bring out the essence of the lyric. 

 Pleasing stage presence and graceful movements made the performance a striking one, though, at times, Souvik seemed to be restless and lacking in poise. The Bengali announcement was unprepared and amateurish. The programme concluded with Prem esechhilo, based on a Tagore poem. The design provided the desired dramatic effect. Utpal Ghosals tabla added life to the entire presentation.

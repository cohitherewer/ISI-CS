The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AS GOOD AS EVER

 Nilaksha Gupta

 Music

 Indo Occidental Symbiosis amp; Academy of Indian Culture presented a five-evening festival of Malhars, the monsoon ragas, in association with The Telegraph at Kala Mandir last week (Aug 20-24). While such a festival is not a bad idea, it exposes listeners to the prospect of hearing at least one long recital in Mian ki Malhar each evening. For, this raga, believed to be one of the many created by Mian Tansen, is a Malhar most instrumentalists and singers seem to know the best. And this did happen at the festival: Hariprasad Chaurasia played the raga on Tuesday, Vishwamohan Bhatt on Wednesday, Ulhas Kashalkar sang it on Thursday and Rashid Khan on Friday. Coverage, by the way, was not possible on Monday.

 The interplay and balance of the two nishads or sevenths, the intonation of the oscillating komal nishad and komal gandhar are major necessities of Mian ki Malhar. The slower part of Chaurasias alap was particularly deficient in the use of the nishads. There were too many shuddh nishads in it and also quite a few phrases without the komal nishad, which was hardly ever intoned in the traditional manner. Moreover, the note rishabh in the phrase re pa was not intoned downward from the madhyam as required in all Malhars. The jod showed some improvement in this regard. The jhaptal gatkari (17 minutes) in this raga, with Kumar Boses spirited tabla playing, was also much better. There was nice rhythmic phrasing and lyricism in the drut gatkari in Desh. The evening had opened with generally competent khayals in Sur Malhar by Rajyashree Ghosh.

 Wednesday evening began with a 30-minute vilambit khayal in Gaud Malhar by Ashwini Bhide Deshpande in the Kishori Amonkar version of the Jaipur Atrauli style. She gave more attention to slow phrase development than in the older version of the style and also wove in some mild rhythms in the medial section. She used the Mian Malhar phrase ni Dha Ni, evident in a part of the antara of the classic composition she sang (Maan na kariye) liberally, something Mallikarjun Mansur for instance never did. Her taankari, naturally, took after Amonkar. It was developed expertly and had variety. The taankari in the drut khayal was good as well. She went on to sing compositions in a raga she called Pratiksha (Sa Re Ga Pa dha), and also a catchy jhula.

 Vishwamohan Bhatt, the modified slide guitar exponent, played his alap, jod and gatkari in Mian ki Malhar with a gusto shared equally by tabla accompanist Kumar Bose. The spirited recital stirred the audience and was occasionally rather loud as well. Bhatt went on to play the ubiquitous pentatonic Megh Malhar (called Megh now) with more attention to gamaks than usual.

 Thursdays final artiste, Ulhas Kashalkar, started his Mian ki Malhar with an eight- minute aochar before the classic vilambit khayal Karim naam tero. The correct and systematic elaboration evoked the raga mood solidly, with more emphasis on phrase development and bol rhythms than taankari. The bol and aakar taans at the end of the vilambit and in the drut khayal, another classic piece, were also as good as ever. Then came a Jaipur Atrauli style vilambit khayal in the rare Dhulia Malhar. After excellent raga elaboration in the first half, there was exceptionally good taankari that developed both rhythmically and melodically. He went on to sing a drut khayal and a tarana in Desh.

 The evening had opened with sarod player Tejendra Narayan Majumdars orderly and tuneful alap, jod and jhala in Ramdasi Malhar. The gatkari was in Jayant Malhar and featured good rhythmic work, bolkari and taankari. Tabla accompanist Anindo Chatterjee played with class throughout and joined the bolkari with powerful saath sangat. Majumdar went on to play a composition in the rare Rupmanjari Malhar (the single-gandhar version).

 In the final evening, Rashid Khan (picture) sang the same vilambit khayal in Mian ki Malhar as Kashalkar. Tonal richness and crisp timbre combined with correct raga delineation to make the khayal among the best he has sung recently. The taankari at its end and in the drut khayal was expertly delivered. The evening had opened with a harmonium recital by Jayanta Bose in Megh. While his significant augmentation of keying techniques and unusual skill were clearly apparent, there was an occasional slip in the flurry of notes that tried to compensate for the limited range of the instrument. He went on to play compositions in the fabled twelve Malhars with a storyline-based development at the end.

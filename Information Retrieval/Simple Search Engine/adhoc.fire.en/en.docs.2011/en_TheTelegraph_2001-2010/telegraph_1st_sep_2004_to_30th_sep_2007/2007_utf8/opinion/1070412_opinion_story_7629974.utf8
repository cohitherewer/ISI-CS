 FOLLOWING THE POISONED TRAIL

 The smoking ban in France will make the Paris caf a healthier place. But would something be lost in the process? asks Somak Ghoshal

 Once upon a time, before nicotine became synonymous with cancer and bad breath, the French chanteur and chain-smoker, Serge Gainsbourg, had crooned huskily, God smokes Havana cigars. From February 2007, however, God would certainly not be seen lighting up in French hospitals, schools, offices, railway stations and airports; and by 2008, not even in cafs, restaurants and nightclubs. This legislation, imposing such a widespread ban on smoking in public, has met with strikingly diverse responses. The medically-conscious advocates of healthy living have greeted it enthusiastically. But seasoned smokers have deplored it as an infringement of their freedom of choice, even after being well aware that around 65,000 people in France alone die of smoking every year. In between these hardliners, are the politically correct, who are troubled by the seemingly insoluble question of individual liberty, but also accept that smoking is an undeniably noxious habit, causing disease and very often, death. 

 Such confusions are inevitable in a world impelled by the necessity to appear multicultural, plural, liberal, fair and democratic, all at the same time, and towards all people. This delicate, perhaps even dubious, balance cannot be achieved without forsaking a vision of the past guarded closely in the mind. The unselfconscious vocabulary of the past has to give way to the forbidding jargon of the present. Smoking is not simply an addiction any more, it has become a form of substance dependence. The familiar image of Parisian cafs teeming with inveterate smokers hopeless addicts, crafty poseurs, brooding melancholics, argumentative intellectuals becomes a non-reality. The historical irony in such a possibility is unmissable: Nicotiana (the botanical name for tobacco) was first imported into the country by Jean Nicot, the French ambassador to Lisbon, in 1559.

 In the 16th century, tobacco was introduced in the French court as a panacea, a magical cure for sundry ailments, although its narcotic effects didnt remain hidden for long. Over the next few decades, nicotine not only travelled across cultural and social epochs, but it also came to stand for a whole range of ideas. It was only in the late-19th and early-20th centuries that smoking became related to a specific liberal, even artistic, notion of the self. Baudelaire, Mallarm and Laforgue known as les potes fumeur (the poets of smoking) wrote inspired eulogies to tobacco. J.M. Barrie memorably captured this crucial moment in the history of selfhood: Men who had hitherto only concerned themselves with narrow things of home put a pipe into their mouths and became philosophers. Prophetically, the advent of existentialism reinforced the iconography of the smoking philosopher, captured by Henri Cartier-Bresson in his photographs of Albert Camus (picture), Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. The image of a smouldering cigarette vanishing into nothingness seemed to literalize the first principles of existentialism: the perception of the human condition as irredeemably nihilistic. 

 Rather than giving rise to contrition, this bleakness produced the ideal basis for a lifestyle that insisted on a culture of smoking, a culture posited outside the economy of health and strength. This way of being did not wish to be cured of its ills, and lose, in the process, the sense of discontent that it was founded upon. In the thickening fumes of the Paris caf, an ambience of creative suspension was nurtured, the serendipitous possibility of seeking after, and arriving at, momentous truths by following the poisoned nicotine trail.

 In the Twenties, Walter Benjamin observed wistfully that if the smoke from the tip of my cigarette and the ink from the nib of my pen flowed with equal ease, I should be in the Arcadia of my writing. Around this time, Proust died of consumption, perhaps having attained the Arcadia of his craft, by writing all night and smoking eucalyptus cigarettes; young Christopher Isherwood sat in a Berlin caf smoking with erotic relish, the smell of the tobacco reminding him of his lover, Bubi. The age of litigation, driven by a health-obsessed consumer culture, is taking away such symbolic, emotional and creative meanings from cigarettes.

 Classical, modern and mechanical

 Music and modernity (Thema, Rs 160) edited by Amlan Das Gupta is an eclectic collection of essays of strikingly varying lengths on several aspects of North Indian Classical Music in an Age of Mechanical Reproduction, as the subtitle explains. As the editor himself confesses, there are a number of inconsistencies in this volume, from the style of presentation to the contents. Jon Barlows couple of essays on the evolution of the sarod, which take up more than 60 pages, though learned and informative, might appear slightly tedious. Some of the pieces stand out for their critical rigour, most admirably Rajeev Patkes dialectical analysis of North Indian classical music and Das Guptas observations on the khayal bandish. Urmila Bhirdikars study of the dissemination of music in Maharastra combines musical sensibility with a sense of social history. The uneven stylistic approaches academic, informal and personal selective footnoting and a few printing errors notwithstanding, this is a valuable addition to musical history. A more clearly defined editorial policy would have brought a structural, thematic and argumentative unity to the book.

 CASTE-BASED RESERVATIONS AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA (Sage, Rs 275) by K.S. Chalam comes with an odd warning from the author in the Preface: Readers might find some repetitions and inconsistencies in the book due to the fact that it has been written over a period of two decades. With this note of caution in mind, the reliability of the rest of the work, although it is replete with tables, statistics, detailed analyses, becomes somewhat suspicious. Intended, ostensibly, as an exhaustive handbook on the history of caste-based reservations and the impact of affirmative action in modern India, it has to be perused at the risk of encountering inaccuracies that might have been retained due to insufficient editorial revision.

 DEAR DAD (Frog, Rs145) by Rajat Mathur is a male answer to the plethora of advice manuals that are written for expecting mothers. Mathur chronicles the highly sentimental journey from the moment he discovered his imminent fatherhood to the time when it finally became a reality. It is a guide to aspiring fathers on how to deal with the changes from pre- to post-fatherhood, handle stress and soothe a volatile pre-natal and depressive post-natal wife.

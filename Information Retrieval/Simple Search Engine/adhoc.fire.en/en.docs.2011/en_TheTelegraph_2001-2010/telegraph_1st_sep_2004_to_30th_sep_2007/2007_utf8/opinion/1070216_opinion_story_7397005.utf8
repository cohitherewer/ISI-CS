 NINETY MINUTES

 - Football and the Faustian bargain

 The Ball is Round 

 By David Goldblatt, Viking, 18

 Writing in his column in this paper some weeks ago, Mukul Kesavan had observed, with some surprise and much regret, that the loyalties of the young urban Indian of the new millennium lie with British or Spanish football clubs, rather than the national cricket team. David Goldblatt who does account for modern urban Asias preference for glamorous foreign football clubs, but feels that in India cricket remains king would have benefited from exploring the dynamics of this shift. In the few pages on India in The Ball is Round, Goldblatt moves from colonial and nationalist performances of the game to the influx of African players and the arrival of corporate houses in the local leagues to the incompetence and venality of the AIFF. And India is only 157th in the latest FIFA rankings. 

 It is in its sheer span that Goldblatts work takes ones breath away. No one has ever attempted something quite like this in the history of any sport, let alone football. When Goldblatt reveals that his goal is to trace, through a history of football, the Faustian bargain that all modern societies have made with the forces of money and power, one is half-incredulous at the ambition. But he nets the goal all the same, with the flair of a Maradona taking on the English defence. 

 It is good that Goldblatt does not follow countries, but time and events. This is the mark of a master. For, it is not possible to write the history of football by following the game from one country to the next. Connections are the key. Goldblatt grabs the game from before its conception (when it was cuju to the Hans, kemari to the Japanese, Tchatali to the Aztecs, Calcio to Florentines, or Knappen to the Welsh) and sees it through its birthpangs in Britains public schools. This is where the wild and endangered games of rural Georgian Britain were bred and developed before being released into the new sporting and social ecology of industrial Victorian Britain. Thence follow footballs industrial, colonial and organizational phases. 

 At this point, which is not even past the quarter-mark of the book, there is a niggling feeling about Goldblatt taking an Anglocentric view of things. Such a view would be entirely unfair, given that Englands contributions to the last half a century of the game have been the hooligans and Posh Spice. Thankfully, unfairness is not Goldblatts game, and it soon transpires that he is at his analytical and lyrical best when he turns to Latin America. 

 Latin America most notably Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and Chile is where football became the beautiful game, helping people survive poverty, unemployment, recession, drugs, dictatorships, wars and every possible unfairness of life. Coming from Brazil, the argument that with more stadiums, it could well be that hospitals will become less necessary does not sound preposterous at all. Nor the fact that in Perons Argentina, football sponsorship was taken care of by the profits of commercial films, 30 per cent of which took sport as their subject usually football. Romantic as it may sound, it is nonetheless true that in Latin America, the nation primarily confronted the world as its football team. 

 The emergence of the Latin American and European schools of football is something that Goldblatt does not take up directly, but weaves into his narratives of the strange twists and turns of soccer around the world. The alignment of the late bloomers that is, the countries of Africa and Asia to either of these styles is a socio-cultural study in its own right. The continental divide is perhaps most apparent in the two biggest global events featuring football, the World Cup and the Olympics. Why is it that European teams have won 16 of the 21 Olympic golds and the Latin American teams only 3, while the scores are evenly poised at 9 each when it comes to the World Cup? And why hasnt an African team made it even to the semi-finals of the World Cup despite winning two Olympic titles? The readers are free to find their own answers with a little help from Goldblatt.

 The fact that more than 200 countries play football at the international level (as one critic points out, FIFA has more members than the United Nations) provides the perfect ground to look for similarities among societies and people separated by thousands of miles of landmass and oceans. One of the joys of reading Goldblatt is spotting such congruences and divergences. The slow erasure of the Catholic-Protestant divide in the composition of the Glasgow Rangers team can thus find a parallel in the story of Calcuttas Mohammedan Sporting, which has come a long way from being an exclusively Muslim outfit: Nigerian Christians, Bengali Hindus and Muslims take the field today donning the same black-and-white jersey. Who knows if football will upstage cricket in India some day? It did in Buenos Aires, where Thomas Hogg of the Buenos Aires Cricket Club organized the first football game under FA rules in 1867. In Genoa too, two exclusively Italian clubs, Sampierdarense and Andre Doria (later to merge as Sampdoria), were formed to combat the success of Genovese cricket.

 Changing allegiances always make for interesting study, and in the history of soccer, these changes are usually determined by the forces of Mammon. In the early days of commercial football in England, clubs looking to make a profit could be faced with the tough choice between a bigger dividend and a better centre-forward. But the followers, in England and everywhere else, ensured that in such situations, there could be only one choice. Goldblatt clearly thinks that it is the people, and not administrative bodies like the FIFA, who have kept the spirit of the game alive.

 With a work of this stature, one does not nitpick. Or it could have been pointed out that no Mantham Gannguly was ever associated with Indian football (Manmatha Ganguly perhaps?). Or that William Tull, one of Englands first black footballers, died in the First World War, and hence did not play for Tottenham in the 1920s.

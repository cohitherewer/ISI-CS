 SACRED OBJECTS 

 - Very little separates the violence of art-work from that 

 of nationalism 

 TELLING TALES 

 AMIT CHAUDHURI

 Once the events in Baroda came 

 to a head, they couldnt be ignored, partly because of the 

 persistent queries they raised. What is a work of art? 

 they seemed to ask. Is it meant for edification or amusement, 

 or some other, mysterious purpose? By some coincidence, 

 it being May a month that exacerbates tempers, but also 

 a fecund time, apparently, for bringing poets and artists 

 to the world the birthday celebrations of Satyajit Ray 

 and Tagore were taking place at almost the same time as 

 the internal examinations at M.S. University, which were 

 to be turned by the VHP into an occasion for a larger quarrel. 

 The celebrations, too, their idiom of documentary footage, 

 speech-making, singing, and the relentless (yet, nevertheless, 

 intermittently exciting) exhibition of two oeuvres Rays 

 and Tagores brought these questions to me in a wholly 

 different register: What is a work of art?; How do we 

 protect it?; Does it need protection?

 The last question probably needs 

 competing answers depending on the context in which it is 

 asked. In relation to Chandra Mohans examination entries 

 (the one Ive seen a picture of consists of a crucifix with 

 a penis hung above an expectant urinal), the answer is 

 an unequivocal Yes. (Chandra Mohan, though, uses the commode 

 rather than the lavatorial urinal in his exhibit; its renaming 

 refers to a piece of canonical art history Ill return to 

 presently.) Yes, because this particular art-work, despite 

 being produced by a student or perhaps because it was 

 produced by one has educative qualities that the vigilantes 

 have missed. Firstly, its salutary to be reminded of the 

 role of physical evacuation in our national, spiritual, 

 imaginative life; its at least as necessary as the faux-Victorian 

 messages such as Cleanliness is next to Godliness and 

 Commit no Nuisance that are scattered through our public 

 spaces. The counterpoint to those god-like ordinances is 

 not the solitary man shitting on the railway tracks, whos 

 either humbled by not understanding what the signs mean, 

 or ignores them altogether; the counterpoint lies in the 

 transformation of excretion into representation, urinal 

 into art-work, which sends out its own, equally strong directive. 

 Secondly, like many others before 

 him, Chandra Mohan is asking his viewers to reconsider rival 

 definitions of the sacred, with an evangelizing zeal, even 

 youthful obviousness. For, as we well know, ever since Marcel 

 Duchamp decided in 1917 to display one, upside-down, in 

 an exhibition space and call it Fountain (his intentions 

 were thwarted not by a culture police, but by the organizers), 

 the urinal has become a sacred, epiphanic object in the 

 history of modern art, and, through over-exposure, almost 

 as unpromising a symbol as the cross itself; it is, therefore, 

 in constant need of reinvention. India, with its proliferating 

 but repressed bodily life, is as good a site as any for 

 the resurrection of the urinal. One route towards reinvention 

 is parody, which is palpably among Chandra Mohans registers. 

 How long has the lone, erect, standing-up action of male 

 urination been associated with the parodic, slightly scandalous 

 conundrum of modern art in the popular imagination? The 

 English phrase, taking the piss, which means to mock or 

 make fun, or make a fool of somebody, and which has been 

 in currency for a while, might well have originated as a 

 shrewd working-class observation on the Duchamp readymade. 

 But to return to the question: 

 Does art need protection? if the context in which its 

 put resembles the birthday celebrations of Ray and Tagore, 

 the answer must be No. With Ray, its still possible to 

 view the art-work in this case, the film outside of 

 the parameters of ritualized obeisance, and be compelled 

 again by it. With Tagore, its become much more difficult, 

 so mediated is he, to us, through his interpreters: the 

 various professional readers, singers, and dramaturges who 

 gather tirelessly around his work. Not long ago, before 

 the wailing, earnest fanfare of 25th baisakh was 

 under way, I was invited to a mansion to attend a reading 

 from the poets works: a preamble of things to come. The 

 event took place in an elegant, chilly drawing room, and 

 the intimate, physical interface between performance and 

 audience made me think that the person whod put this together 

 had paid quite an unexpectedly convincing homage to Jorasanko, 

 towards luxurious domestic setting, almost Buddhist in its 

 composure, and the persistence of space, narrative, and 

 human expectation in the midst of it. 

 And yet, having borne the brunt 

 of many Tagore-songs in my life, a certain soaring quality 

 in their author almost unfailingly troubles my darker side. 

 I could see his portrait hanging on a wall on the left, 

 sage-like but for the teenagers romantic eyes, and was 

 discomfited to feel an irresistible urge to turn it upside 

 down. I suppose a small wave of irritation was the cause; 

 but it was also to escape that gaze, which had taken in 

 such an extraordinary amount of the world, and which we 

 no longer notice. I began to speculate about what might 

 justify an upside-down picture of Tagore as an art-work. 

 Because it takes very little, a gesture, even a strategic 

 knock, to move an object from the space it ordinarily occupies 

 into the one we call culture. Personally, I dont think 

 of Tagore, in the incarnation in which hes presented to 

 us, as culture except in a nationalistic sense: and its 

 nationalism that explains the tone in which the songs are 

 sung, poems recited (the performance that evening, to be 

 fair, was, in spite of being intermittently tremulous, an 

 intelligent exploration of the relationship between reading 

 and setting), and the manner in which he and Ray have often 

 been verbalized in the last fortnight. 

 My latent impulse towards vandalism 

 (which predated the Baroda episode by more than a week) 

 can, in retrospect, be related to and perhaps contrasted 

 with the vandalism that informs the VHPs activities. Arts 

 more anarchic impulses are deeply anti-nationalist in nature; 

 this is something Tagore knew first-hand. And yet theres 

 an intriguing juxtaposition between the violence of the 

 art-work and the violence of nationalism, especially in 

 these days of immediate technological reproduction. The 

 righteous arbiters who blew up the Bamiyan Buddha (and its 

 nationalism, more than religion, that sanctions such outrage) 

 were, in allowing their work to be recorded by a camera, 

 disseminating it to two kinds of audiences, in order to 

 vindicate and satisfy one, and shock and awe the other. 

 But, in letting the moment be reproduced, by permitting 

 it, in effect, to pass into the realm of symbolism, they 

 were also letting its purpose be altered forever. Very little 

 only a question of syntax and symbolism separates the 

 violence of art-work from that of nationalism, and from 

 the possibility of one rearranging the other in its own 

 language. 

 Both art and religion have long 

 been (in the latters case, with a vicious new emphasis 

 in the last twenty years) assimilated into a form of nationalism 

 in our country; this is why Hinduism, in the way its elucidated 

 by Radhakrishnan, or represented in cinema, is often vacuous 

 or assertively pious; it also explains the piety with which 

 the Tagore-song is rendered. This isnt world-denying spiritual 

 piety; nor is it an example of an Arnoldian high cultural 

 piety; its the piousness of nationalism. Thats why its 

 no surprise to learn that a survey has discovered that the 

 educated middle class is essentially in agreement with the 

 VHP that art shouldnt cause offence. 

 Here, lets have a quick look 

 at a word thats come up anew in the last week, with a resonance 

 it doesnt usually have in this country. In a photograph, 

 in these pages, of the protest at the Academy of Fine Arts, 

 a sign hovering over the heads of Jogen Choudhury and Shuvaprasanna 

 declares, Art is Secular (picture). This word, secular, 

 given to us by our Constitution, was famously reinscribed 

 in our national life as a noun, secularism, with a very 

 particular meaning: respect for a plurality of cultures 

 and faiths. In this way, the secular becomes an embodiment 

 of nationalism, and intellectuals in India conduct a discussion 

 thats primarily nationalist, based on a constitutional 

 understanding of the word, when speaking of it. Yet the 

 sign saying Art is Secular is not so much defending a 

 feature of the Indian nation-state as it is an aspect of 

 Indian modernity; this distinction needs to be made; the 

 fact that it isnt leads, in part, to the abrasions weve 

 been witnessing recently. The interior, creative life of 

 the secular, which is one of the most crucial constituents 

 of our modernity, of, in effect, ourselves, has never been 

 fully acknowledged in India; and it has no constitutional 

 defence, unless you place art under the inadequate rubric 

 of freedom of expression. After all, culture is neither 

 a faith, nor a linguistic state, nor a recognized world-view. 

 How do we defend art as Indians unless we admit to ourselves 

 that there are other laws and values that govern our lives 

 as secular human beings besides the constitutional ?

 Letters to Editor

 New year bash

 Sir It is shocking to note that an army officer first misbehaved with a woman and then abused the police after he was arrested for his misconduct (Raid frees officers held for party brawl, Jan 2). The army is synonymous with discipline and order. But the conduct of the two arrested officers, Major Chandra Pratap Singh and Captain Mahesh, as well as that of Lieutenant Colonel Pratap Singh and Major Kavi, the two men who beat up the cops, ransacked the Park Street police station before freeing their men does not speak much of army discipline. The officers have dented the image of the military by acting in such a deplorable manner. 

 The police are also guilty of a serious lapse. They were expected to report the arrest to the army authorities and hand over the offenders to them, but they did nothing of that sort on this occasion. However, one must also remember that the armymen were misbehaving with a woman. Hence, it was necessary to arrest them immediately to prevent further mischief. 

 Yours faithfully,

Manish Chandra Bose, Calcutta

 Sir There is little surprise in the fact that the government has indicated it would not press for a civil prosecution of the army officers and soldiers (Govt, army signal truce on raiders, Jan 3). The governments decision proves that it is unwilling to pursue the matter seriously, despite the outrage in the media and the disapproval on the part of the public. The army has promised to conduct an in-house inquiry and take administrative action against the officers if they are found guilty of the charges. Whatever may be the outcome of the trial, there is no denying the fact that the officers are guilty of vandalizing a public institution. Under normal circumstances, the state authorities would have contemplated serious action against the offenders. But it seems that armymen are above civil law. The government is now trying to explain the conspicuous lack of action on its part by citing the good relations it shares with the army. The entire episode has made the people realize that men in uniform are governed by a different set of laws. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Whatever the army officers may say in their defence, can they cite a justifiable reason for allowing the other miscreants in the lock-up to sneak away? Besides, the allegation of misbehaviour against a woman brought against an army officer cannot be excused under any circumstances. Policemen, with the exception of a few like Bapi Sen, have also been guilty of misbehaving with women on many occasions. Only an exemplary punishment to the errant army officers would discourage securitymen in the country from acting in such an irresponsible manner in the near future.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The fact that men in army uniform ransacked the Park Street police station is indicative of the growing indiscipline among soldiers in the Indian army. This is not the first time that the army has been guilty of disruptive behaviour. High-handedness on the part of security forces is a common feature in the North-east. The army has also alienated itself from the civilians in Kashmir for this very reason. The fact that the army personnel are responsible for safeguarding the borders of the country surely does not give them the right to disregard the laws of the land. The army should be made aware of the limitations of the rights it enjoys in clear and precise terms. Otherwise, incidents like the one in Calcutta will continue. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjay Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir The army should be congratulated for giving the police a taste of their own medicine. On festive occasions, the police suddenly become overactive. They often pick up innocent people from the streets and harass them. On this occasion, the police arrested the army officers along with many others who may or may not have been guilty of any misdeed. Unfortunately for the police, they had no idea of what they were getting themselves into by arresting the drunken officers. Though the soldiers did not quite act in a civilized way, they managed to teach the police a lesson. On new years eve, the cops manning the Park Street police station must have been as helpless as the common man who is routinely mistreated by the men in khaki. 

 Yours faithfully,

Soma Datta, Siliguri

 Sir When men in positions of power get drunk, the result can be disastrous. The brawl in Park Street proved this very fact. The drunken officers must have believed that they could get away with any kind of behaviour because of their rank and uniform. Hopefully, the guilty officer must have realized by now that being in a celebratory mood cannot be an excuse for misbehaving with a woman.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government should respond to the army fracas in Park Street by allowing the common people to visit the affected police station and judge the magnitude of the transgression for themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

Sakti Biswas, Calcutta

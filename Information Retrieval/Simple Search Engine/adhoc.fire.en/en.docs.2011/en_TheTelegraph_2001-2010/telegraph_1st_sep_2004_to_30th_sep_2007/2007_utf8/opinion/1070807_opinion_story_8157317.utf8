 A BRIEF HISTORY OF DESTRUCTION

 FACTS ABOUT HIROSHIMA

 1942: The United States of America 

 launched the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb. 

 On July 16, 1945, the US successfully conducted the worlds 

 first nuclear test in a desert near Alamogordo, New Mexico. 

 Immediately after the test, on July 25, an order was issued 

 to drop an atomic bomb in Japan.

 The Hiroshima Bomb, on account 

 of its long and narrow shape, was initially called Thin 

 Man. However, in the course of its production, the original 

 plans had to be changed. The bomb was shortened and given 

 a new name. It was now called Little Boy,

 August 6, 1945: A B-29 Bomber, 

 Enola Gay, carrying the atom bomb, left Tinian Islands, 

 a six-and-a-half hour flight. It was accompanied by a plane 

 carrying equipment for measuring the bombs destructive 

 power. Another plane followed the Enola Gay for photographing 

 the event. At 7.09 in the morning, a Yellow alert was sounded 

 as the Enola Gay entered Hiroshimas airspace. At 

 7.31, the Yellow alert was cleared. At 8.15, before an air-raid 

 warning could be sounded, the atom bomb was dropped.

 The air temperature at the point 

 of explosion exceeded a million degrees Celsius. (The maximum 

 temperature of a conventional bomb is approximately 5,000 

 degrees Celsius.) Immediately after the explosion, intense 

 heat rays and radiation were released in all directions. 

 The clothing on people living within two kilometres of the 

 hypocenter (the ground directly below the point where the 

 bomb exploded) caught fire. Railroad ties and houses made 

 of wood burst into flames. Trees caught fire, and in some 

 cases, old trees burned from inside out, leaving the outer 

 shell of their trunks intact. Buildings as far as six kilometres 

 from the hypocenter sustained major structural damage. Under 

 the impact of the blast, even the wind reversed direction.

 The exact number of people who 

 died as a result of the atomic explosion in Hiroshima is 

 not known to this day. Casualty estimates have been complicated 

 because the bomb destroyed all population records of the 

 city and victims continued to die over time as the result 

 of exposure to radiation. Official estimate by the Hiroshima 

 city administration has put the number of dead at 140,000 

 by the end of December 1945.

 The physical harm that the atomic 

 explosion caused to the human body included a combination 

 of burns, broken bones, lacerations and damage to skin and 

 internal organs. Of the total number of dead, 60 per cent 

 died of burns, 20 per cent were killed by injuries and 20 

 per cent perished due to radiation effects. Exposure to 

 radiation continues to pose threats to the health of survivors 

 even today. The after-effects of radiation include leukemia, 

 cancer and many other diseases that appeared years later. 

 Pregnant women delivered still-born foetuses and the babies 

 who survived infancy continued to die.

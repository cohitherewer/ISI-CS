 Exempted 

 Making an exception

 Sir All Indian citizens have equal rights while visiting religious, historical and other places of national interest in the country. Hence celebrities such as Amitabh Bachchan treat places of public worship as personal property (Lamboo lords at Lords feet, April 23). The manner in which devotees at Tirupati were made to wait in the sun even as the actors family completed their darshan is deplorable. If the Bachchans are so concerned about their privacy, they should have offered their prayers inside their homes. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Angana Roy Chowdhury,

 Rich in irony

 Sir In Hour of the comprador (April, 27), Ashok Mitra rants and raves against N.R. Narayana Murthy for his decision to play the instrumental version of the national anthem during a presidential visit. Mitra also describes Murthy as a comprador, who is indifferent to the plight of the poor in India. Mitras allegations against Murthy are baseless. He has chosen to turn a blind eye to the significant contributions made by the Infosys Foundation to improve the quality of life in many parts of India. Mitra also conveniently forgets the fact that Murthy has often been critical of a governments policy to acquire agricultural land for industrial purposes. 

 According to Mitra, Murthy has managed to get away with insulting the country and the president. But what about Mitras own party in Bengal? Has it not escaped punishment after it brought about the deaths of poor peasants in Nandigram? Moreover, the Marxists cannot be excluded from the ambit of Mitras definition of a comprador. After all, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been busy taking over agricultural land to help foreign investors set up industries in Bengal.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Ashok Mitras diatribe against spoilt brats from the super rich families was amusing. He alleges that these men are in the habit of running their cars over sleeping pavement dwellers while returning home past midnight from wild drinking orgies. One would like to know how many of the run-over deaths have been committed by family members of Indias super rich fraternity the Ambanis, Birlas or Tatas. Mitra also laments that the rich have inherited the earth in India. But that has been the case in most other countries of the world. So why should it be any different here? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee,

 Sir Ashok Mitras article was well-written and insightful. I only wonder whether the real compradors in modern India belong to the business class or are occupants of high chairs in the government. Whatever may be the case, there is no doubt that our country is headed towards a bleak future as predicted by Mitra.

 Yours faithfully,

H.P. Mitra, 

 Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The players selected to represent India in the forthcoming tour of Bangladesh has left many cricket fans disappointed. The selectors chose to retain some players who have already played for the country while ignoring talented youngsters such as Ranadeb Bose, Ishant Sharma and Rohit Sharma. Only Manoj Tiwari from Bengal and Mumbais Rajesh Pawar made the cut. It is true that Bangladesh beat India in the World Cup. But the fact remains that Bangladesh have a long way to go before they can be considered a force to reckon with. Hence, the selectors could have sent a young team so that the rookies could get some experience of playing international cricket. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Pabitra Kumar Das, 

 Silchar

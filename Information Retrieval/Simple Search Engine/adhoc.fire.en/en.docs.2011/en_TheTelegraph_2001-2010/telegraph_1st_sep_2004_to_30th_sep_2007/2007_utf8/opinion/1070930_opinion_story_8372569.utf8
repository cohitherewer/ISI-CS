 Sky falls on the head

 Sir Even as Calcutta was celebrating India winning the Twenty20 World Cup, I sat tearing my hair. There was no signal on my TV, thanks to Tata Sky. I have noticed that whenever there is a hint of rain, the signal is either scrambled or lost. Apparently, a Tata Sky spokesperson has termed this occurrence as rare. This is certainly not true. I shudder to think how the company functions in the United Kingdom where it rains all the time. Perhaps it is still not time to give the para cable operator the boot. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Rupak Ranjan Roy, Calcutta 

 Poor cousins

 Sir The euphoria surrounding Indian cricketers after their success in the Twenty20 World Cup has angered our hockey players. If the national hockey coach, Joaquim Carvalho, is to be believed, some of the hockey players even decided to go on a hunger strike to protest the governments apathy towards hockey (Twenty20 cash influx sparks hockey threat, Sep 27). Indian hockey players have reasons to feel disappointed. Even though they won the Asia Cup, the remuneration they received was not even a fraction of what the cricketers got after their win in South Africa. India can also taste success in hockey and football, provided the games receive adequate support from the media, sponsors and politicians. The government needs to pay more attention to games other than cricket. Such a step would help develop hockey and football and encourage young people to spend more time in sporting activities.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir Only cricketers are treated like princes in India. All other sportspersons are ignored by our countrymen. Take, for instance, what happened recently. India won the Asia Cup in hockey while our football team won the Nehru Cup by beating the formidable Syrians. Yet, nothing much was made of these victories. It is unfortunate that Indians have chosen to glorify the countrys achievements in cricket alone, a sport that is played in only a few other nations. There are talented players in other sports in India. But most of them go unnoticed because of our silly obsession with cricket. It is sad that the hockey players had to consider resorting to a hunger strike to turn the governments attention to their misery. The jubilation over Indias victory in the Twenty20 World Cup is certainly understandable. The board, too, is entitled to shower gifts on cricketers. But this does not mean that the government and the people have a right to treat players in other sports shoddily and belittle their successes. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir Hockey is considered to be Indias national game. Then, after winning the Asia Cup, why did the Indian hockey team not receive the same honour and prize money as the cricketers? Is it because cricket has hijacked hockeys thunder? In India, there is money in cricket because it is considered to be a glamorous sport. However, the glamour quotient in cricket is the result of careful planning on the part of corporate India. Had cricket been popular globally, it would have been played all over the world, and not just in a few countries. The government must ensure that it restores hockeys popularity in the country. If it fails cricket should be declared Indias national game and the board allowed to function as an autonomous body free of political interference.

 Yours faithfully, 

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

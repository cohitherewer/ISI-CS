The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NO RISK, NO GAIN

 The governments move to allow investment of 5 per cent of the accumulated amount in the new pension scheme in stocks represents a change in mindset that was long overdue. Innumerable studies have shown that, in the long run, the return from equities is higher than the return from bonds, especially from government bonds. There is no rocket science involved in these findings common sense tells us that the market will pay a premium for taking the extra risk. In fact, studies have also shown that a small proportion of equities added to a predominantly fixed-income portfolio actually reduces overall risk because the investor is diversifying his asset classes, which lowers risk. Moreover, the pension fund manager is, in any case, going to spread out his investments over several stocks, which means greater diversification and lower risk. Also, since pension fund contributions will be on a regular monthly basis, it will in effect be a systematic investment plan. This will average out the cost of investment, enabling investors to avoid the pitfalls of market timing. With the increase in life expectancy and the fiscal strain caused by mounting pensions, the only way out is to make the pension fund earn a higher rate of return. 

 The three left-ruled states that are opposing the plan know perfectly well that the old system of guaranteed pensions is unworkable, given the huge fiscal burden that it imposes even Chinese pension funds are allowed to invest in stocks. The clinching argument is that foreign pension funds, including well-known ones like the California Public Employees Retirement System, find Indian stock markets perfectly safe and invest in them. It would be a pity if we allow foreign pensioners to benefit from the growth of the Indian market but deny that advantage to Indians themselves. In any case, the investment guidelines for non-government employees provident fund already allow 5 per cent of the funds to be invested in equities, and the arrangement is now being extended to the NPS. 

 The initial reaction of the stock market has been muted, perhaps because the total corpus of the NPS so far is a mere Rs 1,500 crore. However, there is a tremendous potential for growth if the government is serious about extending the NPS. Public enterprises, government-aided institutions and employees in the unorganized sector, too, can join the scheme. It has been estimated that the potential membership in the scheme can be as high as 75 million, while pension assets under the NPS could total $175 billion by 2015. In short, if the scheme is properly implemented, it could provide a major boost to the countrys stock and corporate bond markets, increasing the flow of savings available for growth, while at the same time countering the influence of foreign flows to the stockmarkets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Officers and gentlewomen

 Sir The revelations made in the report, Its the done thing: lady officers bypassing bosses (April 30), were unsurprising. It is widely believed that professional women are opportunists, who are willing go a long way in order to secure personal gains. However, the story does not mention the equally unscrupulous bosses who bestow these favours on their female employees. No one seems to consider the role of these men in perpetuating such corruption. They are happy not to report against their wily female colleagues as long as their personal desires are appeased.

 Yours faithfully,

 Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Nine-yard nonsense

 The wrong sense

Sir The way some people have responded to Mandira Bedis tasteless dressing sense seems justified. She has indeed insulted our national flag by wearing a sari in which the tricolour appeared somewhere below Bedis knees. (Mandy in six yards of knots, April 30). There has been much awareness in the media regarding the use of the national flag ever since fashion designers started turning it into a brand. So Bedi should not be forgiven for violating the flag code. These days, failed starlets are getting into the news by whipping up needless controversies around themselves. The Shilpa Shetty-Richard Gere kiss is a fitting example of such behaviour. Of course, these sensational episodes do not matter much to the celebrities, who get away with just about everything by mechanically offering their apologies. Such people should be punished so that they think twice in future before using sensationalism as a means for self- promotion.

 Yours faithfully,

 Madhu Agrawal,Dariba, Delhi

 Sir It is a relief to find The Telegraph making light of Mandira Bedis controversial sari, instead of giving importance to the custodians of Indian culture who have been spluttering with rage at Bedi. Is it really worth losing ones temper over such a trivial issue?

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir There is a fine line between deliberately dishonouring ones national flag and doing so out of ignorance or by mistake. Mandira Bedis blunder with her now-infamous sari is definitely of the second kind. But even such unintentional lapses do not stop some of the custodians of Indian culture from filing FIRs and petitions in courts. Would these same people have raised hell if the Pakistani flag happened to trail below Bedis waist? These people should employ themselves in some meaningful activities instead of invoking law and propriety at the drop of a hat be it on the question of a harmless kiss between two celebrities or someones poor sartorial sense.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir The hue and cry over Mandira Bedis sari proves how the Indian media love to turn a molehill into a mountain. It also reveals how Brand India has become one of the most saleable commodities all of a sudden. Bedi, it seems, is not content with selling her image as a cricket presenter. She seems to have decided, after the exit of Team India from the World Cup, to use other ways of drawing attention to herself. This is typical of someone who lacks the credentials to hold the interest of the media. On a brighter note, this episode might make the sari popular among young women once again.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Indian cricket has become a merry hunting ground for opportunists and mercenaries. The players are busier with product endorsements than with the game, while the experts seek controversies to get a bit of the limelight on themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

M.K. Roy, Calcutta

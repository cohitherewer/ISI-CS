The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Bitter taste

 Sir The report, Starvation claims 4 in 7 days (Feb 26), shows that workers in tea gardens are exploited by an uncaring management. Worse, they have to fend for themselves for the lack of alternative employment. The Plantation Labour Act has lost its relevance, and the owners and the government have turned a deaf year to their demands of compensation. The workers survive on poverty alleviation schemes and this cannot be counted as an honourable existence. One wonders how many more deaths are required to wake up the sleeping authorities.

 Yours faithfully,

 Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Total recall

 Sir Aveek Sen seems to be obsessed with the Gujarat riots as if they were the only incident of communal violence to have occurred in independent India. He even goes to the extent of describing riots as a pogrom, which, I think is a misnomer. The violence against Muslims was a spontaneous reaction after the burning of Hindus in a train in Godhra. Pogrom is too strong a word to be used in this context for another reason. The world has witnessed many pogroms Hitler, Pol Pot and Stalin killed millions with the help of a conniving state. However, in Gujarat, only 800 lives were lost, and even this figure is contested. There was no pogrom in Gujarat, and Modi did quite well to quell the violence with an iron hand.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The article, Human interest story (Feb 27), although interesting, had nothing new to offer. Moreover, the assumption that public memory is short is also questionable. The ephemeral nature of collective memory has to do with the fact that people are often unwilling to remember unsavoury episodes. They would rather lead sheltered lives, and shun episodes that are likely to disturb their peace and tranquillity. 

 What happened in Gujarat is powerful enough to shatter the peoples sense of security. Therefore, after things cool down a bit, most of us choose to retire into our private shells, rather than confront the ugly truth. 

 Most film-makers are guided by commercial interests. Thankfully, there are a few who manage to strike a chord and make citizens go through events that they are unwilling to face.

 Yours faithfully,

Tania Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir It is shocking to note that at a time when the HIV/AIDS pandemic has reached alarming proportions in India, citizens are not doing enough to confront this challenge. Crores are being spent in organizing seminars, discussions and discourses but things are turning from bad to worse. One must understand that merely providing condoms to sex workers and supporting the Buladi campaign are not enough. We need to get to the root of the problem. 

 Heterosexual contact is reportedly the main source of transmission of the disease in our country. Infection may also occur as a result of blood transfusion but this is a rare occurrence. Yet, the state administration should spare no chances while combating the disease. Recently, Govind Sarda, a businessman, was arrested for supplying faulty kits to blood transfusion centres. The government must be careful to ensure that such events are not repeated and Sarda is punished for his crimes. Door-to-door campaigns must also be organized to raise awareness levels. This is very important as many HIV patients continue to be discriminated against by doctors both in government and in private hospitals. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

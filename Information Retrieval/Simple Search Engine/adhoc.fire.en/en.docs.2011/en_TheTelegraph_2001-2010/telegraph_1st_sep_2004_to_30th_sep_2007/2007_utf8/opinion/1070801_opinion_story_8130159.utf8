 WHO KILLED THE NCTE?

 - Overlapping jurisdictions in the education sector

 TAPAS MAJUMDAR

The National Council for Teacher Education was known to be already seriously ill when the ministry of human resource development had to rush into action. A special review committee was appointed for the council under the chairmanship of Sudeep Banerjee, former education secretary, government of India, and now chancellor of the National University of Educational Planning and Administration. For those who have not followed the recent changes in the education sector, NUEPA is the latest incarnation of the old National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration that once started as a UNESCO institute for Asia. The other members of the review committee were the eminent educationist and NCERT director, Krishna Kumar, the vice-chancellor of NUEPA, Ved Prakash, and two senior administrators from the MHRD its financial advisor, S.K. Ray, and the joint secretary, Anita Kaul. Ray had previously been the financial advisor and member of the NCTE.

 I wanted to place these details before you because J.S. Rajput, a renowned expert in teacher education himself and in his time chairman of the NCTE and later director of NCERT, has come out with a newspaper article in which he describes the Sudeep Banerjee Committee Report as one produced by a committee of three officials of the Human Resource Development Ministry headed by a freshly retired bureaucrat, and more than hints that the committee produced the report only to discredit the previous regimes good work. 

 Even if I overlook Rajputs strange way of taking count, I find this denigration of experts very disturbing. But I thought there was something even more cynical on his mind when I read the obiter dictum, Government decisions are taken on the basis of political considerations. Before these are put on paper, a committee comprising those whom the Government trusts is appointed and its report justifying the decision is put on file for the sake of formality. 

 This observation on what governments try to do is, of course, neither entirely false nor completely new. If I had been a cynic too, I would have said, If all governments and all experts are like that then why bother to blame it on some? But I am not. What I say instead is that Rajputs obiter dictum is an inane half-truth and it is the other half that civil society lives by. Heaps of self-congratulatory reports are written for the sake of formality and their place is surely the waste-bin. But a few are still written in which experts try to understand past mistakes and suggest changes of course to the powers that be. You do not throw these out and attack peoples professional honesty just because you are not comfortable with what they are saying. 

 Turning now to the report itself, Rajput attributes the major failings of the NCTE to the Central governments (that is, the MHRDs) persistent mishandling, over the past couple of years, of the affairs of this autonomous body. The review committee, it is reported, has recommended the Repeal of the NCTE Act. The death of an institution the nation had so much looked forward to at the time of its birth surely has to be mourned. But the question also to be asked is, who killed the NCTE and how and when? Some will say that the Sudeep Banerjee Committee Report is a post-mortem, and not a death sentence. There may be some merit in this. Let us see why. 

 What had the NCTE Act 1995 wanted the council to do in the first place? I was once made a member of the northern regional committee of the NCTE at Jaipur perhaps by mistake. A bit of what follows is personal impression based on those monthly visits to Jaipur. The rest is heavily compressed stuff plagiarized from the NCTE Act itself. The main objective of the NCTE was planned and coordinated development of the teacher education system throughout India.

 The council was asked to monitor teacher education in the whole country divided into four regions. The NCTE was asked to act, unlike the University Grants Commission, through four regional committees. However, there were in-built problems in their working, mainly because of the act itself. The executive director of each regional committee enjoyed, roughly, a rank not much higher than that of state education officers. At the same time, the NCTE Act made the executive director the head of the regional committee as well. Perhaps to balance this (or make it more interesting) there were a number of old academics like us (even I was not the oldest) made members of the regional committee, and out of them one named chairman of the committee. If this is not odd enough, the other members representing the states of the region were all full secretaries or equivalent in their respective states. 

 Obviously, there is a problem of bureaucratic equation that the academic members could sense but not understand the nuances of. Invariably, the secretaries would send their junior officers to the regional committee meetings as their representatives. They arrived, often a different face each time, an ID chit in hand. This proxy presence, oddly enough, was allowed by the act itself. I remember that proxies were never permitted by the UGC. This one practice at the regional committees destroyed both the solemnity and the sanctity of what were actually the NCTEs quasi-judicial proceedings. The meeting time was sometimes gossiping time because of us, the elders, and sometimes bargaining time because of some others. 

 The council was asked to lay down norms for courses in teacher education, the method of selection of students, the duration of the courses, course contents and curricula. It would lay down guidelines for staffing pattern and staff qualification. It would set standards for examinations for various levels of teacher education, identify recognized institutions and even set up model institutions on its own. Besides, it was required to take all necessary steps to prevent the commercialization of teacher education.

 The objectives of the NCTE were no doubt all laudable. But because the canvas was made so vast, there were many other regulatory bodies already operating on the scene for years, if not for ages. Their jurisdictions and mandates had wide overlaps with the NCTEs. The most obvious overlaps showed up between the UGC Act and the NCTE Act with respect to regulating teacher education in the universities and colleges. But there were many other overlaps between the NCTE Act and the acts of parliament or the state legislatures setting up universities. There were disturbing overlaps with the constitutional responsibilities of many other bodies and of the state governments themselves. 

 These related to functions like laying down courses for teacher education, norms for recruiting lecturers, readers and professors for teaching these courses, fixing student fees and providing minimum physical facilities. Amazingly, the NCTE Act showed no awareness of, and therefore had no remedy for, these anomalies. The Supreme Court did have a general solution of sorts: if in doubt, follow the later act. This did not work very well in education, where a later act is not necessarily a saner act. 

 Compared to its broad-spectrum mandate, the NCTE had unbelievably meagre human and physical resources. For covering the whole gamut of teacher education including research and training of persons for equipping them to teach at pre-primary, primary, secondary and senior secondary stages the NCTE had no money to spend, no regular staff with credible educational accomplishments, no infrastructure comparable to the UGC, NCERT or any of the great universities or state education departments. It could not hope to play the role of regulator of teacher education for India. As to the macroeconomic teacher manpower projections or planning as part of the NCTEs job too, as Rajput seems to have in mind, these needed additional faculty resources far beyond what the NCTE ever had or was even distantly promised. 

 I am not sure if the NCTE, in the best of health, would have been the right place for that exercise. In the event, death came for the NCTE early, but naturally. Only the announcement has been delayed.

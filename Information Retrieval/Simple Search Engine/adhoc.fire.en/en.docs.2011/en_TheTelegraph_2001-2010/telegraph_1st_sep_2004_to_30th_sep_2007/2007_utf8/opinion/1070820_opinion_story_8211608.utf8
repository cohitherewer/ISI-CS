 RISK IS BACK

 Capitalism without failure, says Allen Meltzer, professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon University, is like religion without sin. It just does not work. Measured against the stock market crashes in history, this one may not count as a failure, or even a crash. Generally, there are two types of market crashes. The first and less harmful kind is the sudden onset of panic, a violent overreaction to an event that feels ominous, but tends to be short-lived. With the benefit of hindsight, these crashes are soothingly called corrections (which is what analysts are calling this one). The second, and far more dangerous type, is a prolonged depression. Stock prices will fall at a more sedate pace, there will be the occasional rally, but the value of ones stock portfolio is eaten away over the years. The first kind tends to be spectacular, like the one in 1987, when the stock markets in the United States of America lost almost a quarter of their value the biggest one-day fall in history. A year later, the markets recovered all of their lost ground. The best example of the second type was the Crash of 1929 which had all the attributes of 1987 a flashy exuberance followed by an alarming fall. It took 25 years and a world war to get it back up to its pre-crash value. The financial misery it created ended up being the most protracted global depression in history. 

 It is important to distinguish between a simple crash and a bear market defined as a 30 per cent fall over 50 days. There have been 30 of these in the 20th century, the two worst being between 1972-74 following the oil price hikes by Opec, and the decade-and-a-half decline in the Japanese stock markets. In 1989, the Nikkei had reached 40,000 points; now it is around 15,500. While crashes grab headlines, bear markets bleed by stealth.

 Now to the present. No matter where one looked over the last five years, money was easy to come by, driven by asset price inflation in stocks and housing values, or through easy credit. To compare the levels: in 1970, the financial system measured 78.1 per cent of global gross domestic product the total world output of goods and services of which bank loans were 73.3 per cent. In 1990, finance was 83.3 per cent of world GDP, with bank loans at for nearly 79 per cent. Today, the derivatives market is 1080 per cent of global GDP, and securitized debt for example, sub-prime mortgages is 150 per cent. The financial system is so big compared to the real economy that it is now the locomotive, not a wagon. And there is the idea that there is no downside. But now, there may be a return to basics: debt will be valued by repayment capacity, and equity valuations will be based on profits. Risk is back in the markets, and it is a good thing, too.

 FOR A WORLD WITHOUT WAR

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the report of the UN secretary-general, August, 2006

 The track record of peacebuilding efforts is decidedly mixed. By some counts, between a third and half of those countries that emerge from war relapse into it within five years. This phenomenon was illustrated in recent years by the relapse into violence in Haiti and a resurgence of tension in Timor-Leste, both cases requiring the return of international peacekeepers. In these and similar cases, too little had been done to re-establish the institutional and economic conditions that can sustain political competition within a framework of constitutional order and law.

 That peacebuilding often fails is not a source of surprise. The political fractures, social and economic inequalities, resource scarcities and other tensions that generate conflict are exacerbated, not diminished, by war. The mere fact of the signing of a peace agreement does not signify an end to these sources of conflict; peace agreements are at best merely a long-term road map for overcoming them. Implementation of those agreements and the wider process of restoring political and economic relationships is the harder part of the battle.

 A source of surprise, no; but a source of deep concern, certainly. For not only does relapse into war squander national and international investments in peacemaking and recovery, the fighting that occurs after the collapse of a peace agreement is sometimes far more deadly than in earlier rounds, as the belief of the concerned parties in the prospects of reconciliation is shattered, the possibility of power-sharing seems more remote, and thus a winner-take-all mentality pervades. In such circumstances parties often commit to total war and the mass killing it can entail.

 Parties themselves are often conscious of this risk, and thus sometimes take the tough decisions to forge the necessary political compromises, build the necessary institutional restraints and make the necessary sacrifices to restore the populations faith in the prospects of recovery. 

 Where peacebuilding succeeds it is always the leadership of domestic actors that is the essential ingredient of success. No amount of international engagement can substitute for domestic political leaders shouldering their responsibilities and leading their people towards peace and development.

 Domestic leadership is the essential condition of peacebuilding, but it is rarely a sufficient condition. Rather, substantial international support has often made a crucial difference. Indeed, notwithstanding important failures, the fact is that over the past decade international assistance for the implementation of peace agreements and for wider peacebuilding processes has made a critical contribution to an overall decline in the level of civil war in the world an achievement of historic significance.

 And when peacebuilding efforts have succeeded as they have in El Salvador, Guatemala, Mozambique, Cambodia, Rwanda and Eastern Slavonia, and show every sign of doing in Burundi, Sierra Leone and Liberia they show the United Nations system working at its best. The United Nations is first and foremost, of course, a membership organization. And peacebuilding highlights this not only because of the irreducible role of national leadership, but also in that the major contributors to peacebuilding efforts are Member States both regional governments that can vitally help to stabilize emergent national authorities and donor governments that provide the bulk of financial resources to the reconstruction process besides an additional layer of political support.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WRONGS AT PAR

 Two wrongs do not make a right. Some of Indias elected representatives of the people proved the validity of this old saying. In what is becoming a common occurrence in parliament, some members rushed to a minister and physically stopped him from introducing a bill. Those who engaged in this totally unparliamentary behaviour hailed from West Bengal and owed allegiance to Left parties. Nothing can justify this kind of rowdyism within the hallowed portals of parliament. Such behaviour violates every single norm and convention of democratic practice. The parliament is a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas. It is not a place to display muscle power. The members of parliament from West Bengal may have had every reason to dislike the bill that was being introduced. It was open to them to oppose the bill and defeat it. They chose not to do this. Instead, they rushed to the minister concerned and snatched the papers from him. This is unpardonable. The Left MPs have not only disgraced themselves but they have also disgraced the people who elected them and the state they represent. This kind of behaviour only justifies the demand that MPs should be made to undergo a training on democratic procedures and practices. As the Indian democracy deepens and embraces sections of the population that are unfamiliar with the conventions of civil society and parliament, this kind of unparliamentary behaviour will continue to recur. The strength of Indian democracy is manifesting itself as one of its weaknesses.

 The behaviour of the Left MPs is one wrong. The other equally serious wrong was committed by the minister concerned, Mr T.R. Baalu, who holds the shipping portfolio. Mr Baalu, who belongs to the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and is thus obviously elected from Tamil Nadu, was introducing a bill to set up a maritime university in his home state. The fact of the matter is that in West Bengal there already exists the Marine Engineering and Research Institute, which could easily be raised to the status of a university. Mr Baalu would, of course, have none of this. He was playing the old and familiar game made into a fine art by ministers from Tamil Nadu of trying to take new projects to his own state. This is a blatant use of power and is a kind of nepotism. Members of the Union cabinet should think of India and not just of their own state. When they fail to do so, they also transgress democratic norms.

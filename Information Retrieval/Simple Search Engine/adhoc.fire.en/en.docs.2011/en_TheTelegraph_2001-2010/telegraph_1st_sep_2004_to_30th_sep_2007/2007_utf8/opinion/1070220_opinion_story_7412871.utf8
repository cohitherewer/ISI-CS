 CAMERA DOES NOT LIE

 Malvika Singh

 While watching a news item on television the other evening on the possible nomination of Amitabh Bachchan for the post of the president of India, I was not quite sure whether I was watching a contemporary revue or a true news report. Probabilities such as this jolt one into the reality of the now-exposed intellectual backwardness of our elected and other representatives, who determine the immediate fate of this nation from within the walls of the parliament as well as from their various party platforms.

 Live political news coverage is the best soap on the box and it is for free. These half-hour shows require no sets, no costumes, no dialogue-writers. The country watches spellbound as leaders make fools of themselves and their colleagues, demeaning their profession with every passing day. India listens patiently to the garbage being spewed, the political diatribe, the abuse and the hitting-below-the-belt. It observes the images of the failure of governance in every sphere of life, the widespread corruption, the dishonesty of the leaders, the breakdown of law and order, the carelessness of policy-makers, the criminality of the political hangers-on, the financial ascendancy of these rulers and their friends at the cost of the ordinary, honest, hard-working citizens, who are forced to function and deliver in an anarchic system in which the good are punished and the bad are celebrated and absolved of all crimes. That is our India. That is the great new contemporary Mahabharata.

 Rise and shine

 However, the largest single audience in the world, riveted to the unfolding saga of the protagonist and antagonist melting into each other, is on the verge of a revolt. People are already sickened by the crass contemporary actualities that mar what was once a great civilization with unmatched philosophical standards and outstanding thought. History has shown time and again that when the top does not see or hear the voice of the bottom, the empire changes hands and shifts gear. That is the hope, the glimmer of light on the far horizon, one that will grow and hopefully burn to embers the present exploitation of nearly one quarter of the earths populace. 

 Imagine a young and lively generation watching with rapt attention the live coverage of privileged public figures taking bribes, shooting adversaries point-blank, fiddling with witnesses, fixing the authorities and institutions that at one time were the celebrated pillars of our democracy. And now try to figure out what is going on in their brains about their future prospects in a country of such horrors. Think of how they are dealing with these realities internally and what effect these must have on their attitudes and mindsets. It is scary, to say the least.

 As Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram always manage to find time to address the corporate world and foreign investors, ignoring the chronically unattended problems that come with lopsided growth, and as they tom-tom the rate of growth, they talk less and less about the real problems that need solutions. This is a dangerous development that is fast becoming the norm and compelling violent protest from a majority that has not been heard or listened to.

 Our leadership, which has displayed its arrogance over the last many decades, is on the verge of being assaulted by the people, who are, thanks to the vivid images on their television sets, not going to accept this kind of corrupt governance much longer. If India is to rise out of the mire and filth, join the world and compete legitimately, the priorities will need to be reframed, methodologies and modern systems will have to be developed, wealth-generation will have to be respected, and the stranglehold of the bureaucracy will have to be reduced radically.

 May this expos live on...

 Letters to Editor

 Truth in a frame

 Sir The photograph titled Party punches, Buddha soothes (Dec 10) was quite revealing. It shows a bespectacled young man, supposedly a member of a Naxalite group, being punched by a CPI(M) supporter. An elderly gentleman holds the students hands while it seems that another cadre is mouthing the choicest expletives at the victim. So long, we were taught that the Naxalites are the ones who are adept at using violence to establish their points of view. But the picture tells a different story altogether, doesnt it?

 Yours faithfully,

 Too much to take

 Sir Biswadeep Bhattacharya, a talented table tennis player, lost his life after his father, Deepak, hit him for withdrawing from a practice session. This shocking incident is yet another reminder of the enormous pressure parents put on their children for them to succeed in life. Biswadeeps death proves that todays children are often tortured psychologically by their parents. Biswadeep, only fourteen years old, was a member of the Bengal team that won the sub-junior national championships in Chennai. There can be no doubts about the fact that he would have won many more tournaments in the future. But Deepak Bhattacharya cared very little for the welfare of his own child and cut the boys life short in a fit of rage. Men like Deepak should be given exemplary punishment so that the lives of other unfortunate children can be saved.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Parental pressure is not 

 unknown in middle class homes. It seems that every parent 

 wants his or her child to become an Amartya Sen at work 

 or a Sourav Ganguly at play. The family of Biswadeep Bhattacharya 

 was no exception. It was not enough for his ambitious father 

 that his son was a table tennis champion. Yet, at the same 

 time, it will be unfair to accuse Deepak of murdering his 

 son. What happened in this case is a classic example of 

 accidental death. Papiya Bhattacharya, Biswadeeps mother, 

 has accused her husband of killing her son. But the grieving 

 mother may have been compelled to say such things at the 

 instigation of her meddlesome neighbours. Perhaps, the neighbours 

 should leave the Bhattacharya family alone in this hour 

 of grief. However, Biswadeeps death shows that children 

 become the victims of various kinds of pressures early on 

 in life. Blaming Deepak alone is unlikely to solve the problem. 

 For, it is a flawed social system that is responsible for 

 such tragedies that take place in families today. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 The injustice league

 Sir The attack on Somalia by the United States of America is shameful to say the least. It seems that the Americans think they have the licence to attack any country in the world in the name of the war against terror. In fact, this policy drafted by the hawks in the Bush administration violates the tenets of international law. Strangely, despite its military muscle, the Americans only pick on poor, defenceless countries like Somalia, which are incapable of getting themselves heard on the international stage. 

 Shockingly, the US is unwilling to spare any thought on the people who get killed as a result of such violence. Throwing a couple of dollars as compensation to the families of those killed is just not enough. Military interventions such as these are crimes against humanity and the US administration should be hauled up in the International Court of Justice. This will stop Bush from attacking nations that are already reeling under poverty and corruption. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Goa

 STORY OF A PIONEER 

 Raju Mukherji

 FIFTH COLUMN 

 An impression has been created 

 that Monty Panesar is the first Sikh cricketer to represent 

 England. The idea is fast gaining ground because even the 

 hallowed compendium of cricket, Wisden Cricketers Almanack, 

 mentioned in its 2007 edition that no Sikh cricketer has 

 played for any nation other than India.

 This statement, however, is not 

 based on facts. The first Sikh cricketer to play for England 

 (then MCC) was Bhupendrasingh, the Maharaja of Patiala. 

 In 1926-27, Bhupendrasingh played in two unofficial Tests 

 under Arthur Gilligan against India. The matches were held 

 in Bombay and in Calcutta.

 Bhupendrasingh was not a left-arm 

 spinner in the mould of Monty Panesar but a hard-hitting 

 right-handed batsman, exceptionally strong with the cut 

 and the pull. In 1911, at the age of 19, he had toured England 

 with the Patialas All-India team and had created quite 

 an impression.

 After representing England in 

 unofficial Tests in 1926-27, he was billed to lead India 

 in the inaugural official Test match. Actually he was selected 

 to captain India in England in 1932, but official duty made 

 it impossible for him to make himself available. As a result, 

 Natwarsinhji, the Maharaja of Porbandar, was nominated the 

 captain. Ultimately, both Natwarsinhji and his deputy, Ghanashyamsinhji, 

 the Maharaja of Limdi, stepped down voluntarily, which enabled 

 the talented C.K. Nayudu to lead India in the inaugural 

 Test.

 Bhupendrasingh of Patiala lost 

 his chance to be the leader of the team in an official Test 

 match. Ironically, the same fate befell his son, Yadavendrasingh, 

 the Yuvraj of Patiala. Yadavendrasingh was a batsman of 

 class. He had immense power in his stroke-play and was a 

 magnificent driver of the ball. Like his father, he had 

 a rasping square cut and could be relied to pull the ball 

 high and handsome.

 Fathers and sons

 He made his debut in the official 

 Test in Madras in 1933-34 against Douglas Jardines team. 

 In the first innings, he was Indias highest scorer with 

 a superlative 60 against the likes of Clarke, Nicholls and 

 Verity. In the next innings, he had another creditable outing, 

 scoring 24 runs. That was the last Test of the series and 

 Yadavendrasingh got no other opportunities that season.

 However, in 1935-36, Jack Ryders 

 Australia came to play a four-Test unofficial series against 

 India. In the first Test, Yadavendrasingh led India but 

 in the following two Tests, he played under the leadership 

 of Nayudu and WazirAli respectively. Thereafter his career 

 paralleled that of his fathers. In 1932, Bhupendrasingh 

 had not been able to lead India in an official Test match. 

 This time around, his son failed to do the same, although 

 he was the favourite, along with Nayudu and WazirAli, for 

 the captaincy.

 Indian cricket, even then, was 

 a hub of corruption and parochialism. The undeserving Maharajkumar 

 of Vizianagram, Vizzy for short, was appointed Indias 

 captain to England in 1936 while deserving candidates such 

 as Nayudu and Wazir Ali went as ordinary members. 

 Worse, Yadavendrasingh could not 

 make it to England. If he had gone on that tour, the whole 

 history of Indian cricket would have been written differently. 

 On that tour, India had a fine set of players. But Vizzys 

 inept handling of players led to failure. Unlike Vizzy, 

 Yadavendrasingh would have made a wonderful captain. He 

 would have been able to harness the talents of his players 

 and led them to success. Unfortunately, it was not to be.

 Both father and son, though deserving, 

 missed out on captaining India in an official Test. However, 

 the fact remains that Bhupendrasingh was the first Sikh 

 cricketer to have played for England. Monty Panesar is merely 

 following in the great mans footsteps.

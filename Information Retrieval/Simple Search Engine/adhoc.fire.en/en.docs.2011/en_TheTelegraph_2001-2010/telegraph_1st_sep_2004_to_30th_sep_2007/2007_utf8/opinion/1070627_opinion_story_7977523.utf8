The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ART AND CRAFT

 The tears, the shock and the hurt are all genuine. No amount of disciplining will ever convince the Congressmen in Bhopal and Moradabad, now expelled from the party, about their indiscretion. In depicting Sonia Gandhi as goddess Durga, and as the Rani of Jhansi in a separate poster, the partymen were neither indulging their perverse imagination nor committing an exceptional sin. Ms Gandhi has been featured as the goddess in Uttar Pradesh prior to elections, perhaps as the surest way to instil a fighting spirit among the rank and file. Even before such pestilential times in UP, the divine form has been invoked in relation to Congress leaders. Indira Gandhi is supposed to have been celebrated as Durga following Indias victory in the Bangladesh war in 1971, and without raising much Cain. Enormous birthday cakes, soul-stirring slogans arguing for dynastic rule as the solution to Indias ills, and open adulation from senior leaders in public fora have evoked only the most benign reactions from the Nehru-Gandhis. The guilty Congress leaders in Indias small town had no way to suspect that their show of reverence for the party leader would be construed as a misadventure on their part. 

 One cannot question the haste with which the party leadership has sought to distance itself from such mischief and the sureness with which it has gone about condemning the act. The crudeness of the posters (Rahul Gandhi was portrayed as the child on Rani Laxmibais back), the impending legal wrangle (a case has been lodged in Moradabad) and the unabashedly communal touch in the use of Hindu religious symbolism must have disturbed the party sufficiently. However, the partys problem with the artists ought to be viewed in the larger perspective. The vice which fires their creative instincts is sycophancy, and this is often their best device to make themselves seen and heard in a political milieu that gives more merit to loyalty to a person than that to the party and principles. Within the Congress, this fact has held true since Indira Gandhis unapologetically personalized rule. It holds true even today, when the seniormost leaders of the party fall over themselves to pay obeisance to its president. The situation is not too different elsewhere in the country. Which is why such mad art is so ubiquitous in India.

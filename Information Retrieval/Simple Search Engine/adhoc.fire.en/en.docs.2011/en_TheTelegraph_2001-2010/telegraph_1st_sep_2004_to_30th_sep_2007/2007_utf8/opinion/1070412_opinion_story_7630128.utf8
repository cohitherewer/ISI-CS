The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NO KILLJOYS, PLEASE!

 Journalists everywhere love to rub shoulders with prime ministers. I love to fly with PMs. It isnt because great stories are broken on such assignments. Flying on Air India One, as the Indian PMs plane is called, has its pleasures. You join big talk on big things with all the PMs men between plentiful supplies of champagne and caviar, lavish meals and the latest newspaper gossip. 

 But such pleasures are pass compared to Air India Ones single biggest blessing it is the only plane in the world on which I can smoke during a flight. Well, you still have to move to a smokers corner near the toilets. Thats where they allowed you to smoke on international flights before the no-smoking mania killed that particular joy of living.

 But even in those days, before they were disempowered, smokers were damned. Air hostesses looked at you as if you were a rapist or murderer, or both. At glittering, new airports now, they make you feel like fugitives from justice. On board Air India One, the lovely ladies keep smiling, no matter what they may actually feel about you as a smoker. 

 Sad will be the day when this very special privilege of the privileged journos falls prey to mad prohibitionists. Sadder still the day when a PM made in the mould of Morarji Desai bans drinking and smoking on his special aircraft. I never had a chance to fly with Desai. Not a great miss, I would think. 

 But then, the world is becoming a dreary place for smokers everywhere. There was a time when smoking and drinking were to journalism what a short walk by the Yarrow must have been to Wordsworth a call to creation. Some years ago, I read a wonderful collection of essays on the vanished world of Londons Fleet Street. The book is called Secrets of the Press. It conjures up the world of the smoke-filled little bars on Fleet Street, where famous journalists planned the first drafts of great stories. The corporate-style newspaper offices of today and the politically-correct young journalists, who drink only wine and dont smoke at all, could have been teachers at a convent. 

 We all know the arguments against smoking. It all began where all strange ideas of our age begin in the US, in the Surgeon-Generals Report. Who doesnt know the risks in smoking? But arent there just as many risks in the life of a non-smoker? The question, after all, is one of choice. Mountaineering has even worse risks one false step and you die. But only an idiot will ban mountaineering because of that. Someone who has seen that beauty of a Himalayan peak, Ama Dablam, bathed in the glow of the setting sun will only pity those who wont go to the mountains for the risks. Hopefully, smokers will always manage to find ways to stay ahead of killjoys of every kind.

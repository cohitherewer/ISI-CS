 THE CARNIVAL BEGINS 

 Raju Mukherji

 FIFTH COLUMN

 Never before have so many nations 

 got together to organize one sports championship. The ninth 

 cricket World Cup is being hosted by nine Caribbean countries 

 Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad amp; Tobago, Antigua, 

 Grenada, St Kitts amp; Nevis, St Lucia and St Vincent. 

 Cricket was once the rallying point for this archipelago 

 of emerging nations, but now, amid the perpetual rivalry 

 among disparate groups, the game suffers the most. The success 

 of the competition would depend upon how well these politically 

 and economically divergent entities pull together.

 Sixteen teams are taking part. 

 The ten full members of the International Cricket Council 

 have five associate members for company Scotland, Holland, 

 Ireland, Canada and Bermuda. Kenya happens to be the 16th 

 side by virtue of its ODI status granted by the ICC. Kenyas 

 status is unique. It is neither a full member playing in 

 tests nor an associate member needing to qualify for the 

 World Cup through participation in the ICC Trophy. Kenya, 

 however, had done exceedingly well in the 2003 World Cup, 

 where it reached the last four.

 Scotland, Holland and Ireland 

 are not to be trifled with. All these teams have some very 

 capable players who play first-class cricket in England, 

 South Africa and Australia. Canada has a long, although 

 not very distinguished, history of cricket. The earliest 

 international cricket match was played between Canada and 

 United States of America in 1844, more than 30 years before 

 the Anglo-Australian matches began. In fact, the first overseas 

 cricket tour also involved Canada. A cricket team from England 

 made the first overseas tour when it played matches in the 

 US and Canada in 1859. Unfortunately, cricket did not thrive 

 in Canada as the British influence waned with the emergence 

 of the French connection. 

 A share in the glory

 Bermuda, too, has had a long association 

 with the game. Situated off the coast of Pennsylvania, the 

 islands played cricket because of the strong British presence. 

 The influence was enough to produce a cricketer who attended 

 the trials for the selection of the West Indies team to 

 tour England in 1933. A technical issue (Bermudas could 

 not be considered a part of the Caribbean islands) stopped 

 Alma Hunt from playing for the West Indies. 

 Bermuda never quite had the scope 

 to play official international cricket as it was always 

 outside the periphery of the very exclusive ICC orbit, which 

 included England, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, 

 West Indies, India and Pakistan. Even in the inaugural World 

 Cup in 1975, with colour-conscious South Africa banished, 

 only the other six test-playing nations took part. To alter 

 the illogical system, Bermudas representative to the ICC 

 suggested that a championship be held among the associate 

 member countries. Thus, in 1979, began the ICC Trophy for 

 associate countries. The top teams were to qualify for the 

 actual World Cup. So Bermudas contribution to cricket is 

 not to be ignored.

 From 1979 onwards, many associate 

 members have had the opportunity to prove their worth and 

 have come to be accepted among the elite members of the 

 ICC. Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Kenya have shown 

 that they are in no way inferior to the more experienced 

 nations. 

 This years World Cup promises 

 to be Indias hour of glory. As one-day cricket is primarily 

 to do with batting, the sheer depth in Indias batting line-up 

 makes them the favourites. Another thing in Indias favour 

 is the fact that the Caribbean pitches are now slower 

 a condition in which the Indian batsmen thrive. The spinners 

 too should rub their hands in glee. The other advantage 

 is that the selectors have relegated Greg Chappell to the 

 sideline. They have placed total reliance on tried and tested 

 men. Lets hope Rahul Dravid does not disappoint.

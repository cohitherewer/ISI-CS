 THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST

 Indian football must learn its lessons from the untimely death of FC Kochi 

 LOST FOUND

 The website, www.fckochin.com, belonging to Indias first professional football club, declares loftily that the main objective of the clubis to promote football in a professional way and to contribute to the youth and sport development programmes being envisaged in the country. In Indian football, pious proclamations by club managements are never meant to be serious. This one proved to be no exception. FC Kochi, which was started by a group of Malayali businessmen with generous support from a sizeable NRI community, tasted some early success. Then it spluttered on for a few more years, before folding up in 2002. Its promise of developing football died with it.

 In a short life, the club did have its moments. It won the Durand Cup in 1997 a triumph that the press in Kerala dubbed as more important than Arundhati Roy winning the Booker Prize. The clubs approach to the game was refreshing too. Here, football was meant to be played and managed in a manner that matched international standards. FC Kochi, unlike most other clubs, had its own stadium. The players got handsome salaries and other perks such as imported jerseys, plush accommodation and air travel. The management also toyed with the idea of starting a football nursery, and loaning its players to other sides during the lean season. The last was a novel idea at the time.

 Yet, the club, run on corporate lines, failed to survive. The fault lay as much with the players as the officials. For the management and sponsors, the club had little to do with football or its development. It was a short-term, profit-making venture, an experiment that could be discarded once the coffers ran dry. More importantly, despite having a sizeable following, the fans did not own the club. When the club shut down, there was little that the fans could do. The management was unwilling to shun cold, business logic and bear the losses. It didnt help that success was few and far between other than the Durand Cup, FC Kochi did not win any major trophy. The poor showing turned the sponsors away, depleting its resources further.

 Indian football, however, can take some lessons from FC Kochis fate. The clubs brisk rise, followed by an equally hasty fall, shows that corporatization alone cannot put the game back on its feet. This is not to say that corporatization is unimportant. Funds, a professional league (supposedly on the anvil), better infrastructure and wider coverage could go some way in reviving the game. Corporate houses can ensure all this and more inject professionalism and transparency, two critical elements absent in football management in India. But the fans, and those who care about the game, must be entitled to some kind of ownership too if only to prevent an unscrupulous management from treating a club as a mercantile venture, and reneging on its promise to develop the game. In this respect, India, the visiting Fifa president correctly pointed out, needs to look at Spain. Real Madrid, for instance, is owned by 85,000 members who pay annual dues and elect the clubs president.

 I.M. Vijayan, the mercurial striker, had once described FC Kochi as Indias No. 1 team. It might not have lived up to this, but its story has lived on. Viva Kerala, another young club with professional ideals, has qualified for the NFL first division this year. Soccer is not always merciless. It offers a second chance, unlike most other things in life. It remains to be seen if Viva Kerala has learnt from FC Kochis failures.

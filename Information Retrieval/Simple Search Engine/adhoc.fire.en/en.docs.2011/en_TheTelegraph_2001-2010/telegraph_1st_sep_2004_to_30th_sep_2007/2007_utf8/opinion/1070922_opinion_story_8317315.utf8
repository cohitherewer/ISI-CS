 THOUGHT, INTERRUPTED

 THIS ABOVE ALL - KHUSHWANT 

 SINGH

 A colourful life

 I often wonder why India never 

 produced intellectuals who radically changed peoples 

 way of thinking and brought about changes in society. We 

 produced dreamers and visionaries like Gandhi, Nehru, Subhas 

 Bose who caused political upheavals that changed the course 

 of our countrys history. However, the only one of 

 the trio who ushered in lasting social change was Nehru 

 because he had freed his mind of the cobwebs of religiosity. 

 We did have a few intellectuals like M. N. Roy and Nirad 

 Chaudhuri, but their impact on our way of thinking was minimal.

 In Europe it was different. By the middle of the 18th century 

 the church had lost its monopoly as the solementor of society. 

 The spoken word was replaced by the printed word. The upper 

 echelons of society were literate and began to turn to tracts, 

 treatises and books written by scholars, most of whom did 

 not accept teachings of the Bible or of the apostles as 

 gospel truth. The educated elite led the way to social reform, 

 and the masses followed their lead. This did not happen 

 in India. Only a minuscule section of our aristocracy was 

 enlightened. It knew how to give orders but not convince 

 people that they were right. The Western educated elite 

 expressed its views in English known to barely 2 per cent 

 of our population. As a result, preachers of religion continued 

 to remain guardians of social morals. The written word did 

 not replace the spoken word. It has not done so to this 

 day. That is why intellectuals made no impact on Indian 

 society.

 Another factor which put Indian thinkers at a disadvantage was our attitude towards our gurus teachers. They had to be of impeccable character, saintly, almost godlike. If they were found to drink, fornicate, be homosexual, liars or cheaters, they were put out of reckoning. This never bothered Europeans most of their intellectuals were hard-drinkers, womanizers, spongers and self-promoters. Nevertheless, they were held with respect because of what they wrote.

 What I have said can be illustrated by the teachings and personal life of one such visionary, regarded by scholars as the pioneer of intellectualism in Europe: Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-78). He was unknown till he won an essay competition organized by a little known provincial French academy on the topic Whether the rebirth of the Sciences and the Arts has contributed to the improvement of morals. This was in 1750 when Rousseau was 39 years old. Almost overnight this non-entity was catapulted to celebrity status. Rich aristocrats put their chateaus at his disposal; they arranged salons and invited their friends to listen to what he had to say because he roused in them a feeling of guilt for being rich and privileged. The novels and essays he wrote thereafter were gobbled up by avid readers. He wanted the citizens and the state to redraw the contract of their relationship, giving citizens a much bigger role in the government and freedom of expression and behaviour. His aphorisms were on peoples lips and are remembered to this day: The fruits of the earth belong to us all, the earth itself to none; Man is born free and is everywhere in chains; patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel. And many others. To look for an Indian parallel to Rousseau would be futile.

 What was Rousseau like as a man? He was the second son of a not-too-prosperous Swiss watchmaker. He lost his mother when he was still a child and was brought up by his father. His elder brother ran away from home. He was 15 when his father died. He grabbed all the familys assets without bothering to look for his brother. Brought up as a Calvinist, he converted to Roman Catholicism to gain the favour of a rich French woman with whom he lived for many years. He had a crooked penis and had trouble holding back his urine. At times he had to use a catheter. Nevertheless, he persuaded the young Therese, who laundered his clothes to become his mistress. She bore him five children, all of whom he deposited at the doorstep of an orphanage soon after they were born. He had other mistresses from time to time. While on a visit to England where he was lionized by the English aristocracy, James Boswell diarist and biographer of Dr Samuel Johnson who was escorting Therese had no problem taking her to bed. 

 Rousseau was for ever complaining of ill health and insomnia. This was largely to gain sympathy because he was rarely ill and was known to snore lustily throughout the night. He was a shameless sponger and freeloader; later he reviled people he had lived off publicly. He wore garish clothes entirely to attract attention to himself.

 In India, a man like Rousseau would have been spat upon as a clever badmash. In France, his body rests in the Panthon among the greatest of the nation.

 A question of numbers

 How is it that, while we celebrate Janmashtami and Ram Navami every year, know the exact times and places when Sri Krishna and Shri Rama were born, we do not know the years in which they were born? I wish some scholar of Hinduism would enlighten us on the subject. Why is it taboo to ask this question?

 Another question to which I have hitherto failed to get a satisfactory answer is the significance of the number 108. Why do Hindu rosaries have exactly 108 beads (mankas), never more or less? Christian, Muslims and Sikhs also use rosaries as aids to prayer or while meditating but they attach no significance to the number of beads on them. There is no mention of 108 in the Vedas or the Upanishads. When and by whom did 108 come to be invested with such a special significance? I am sure there are many who are intrigued by this. 

 Lettered truth

 For bridegrooms who demand a dowry as a pre-condition, all you have to do is to substitute the letter D by a B to get at the truth: Bribegrooms.

 Letters to Editor

 Bard in the water

 Sir Jadavpur Universitys construction engineers can hardly improve the state of the Rabindra Sarobar by trying out Prem, Prakriti and Puja at Lake (Jan 29). At best, the Bengalis fondness for all things Tagorean will be catered to, without imbibing the aesthetic ideals of the poet. Calcutta has turned into the most aesthetically challenged metro because its engineers and architects do not have an eye for beauty. The university should be left to its academic tasks and the project awarded to a specialist firm chosen through competitive submission of designs. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Bhashkar Majumdar, Kuwait

 Unwise words

 Sir Deep frustration caused Bal Thackerays outburst against A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi (Sena spits fire at president, Jan 31). The Shiv Sena chief knows that his political supremacy is over not only is the Sena no longer in power in Maharashtra but it has split as well. True, the Shiv Sena has recovered some lost ground by winning the Mumbai municipal polls, but Thackerays comments on Kalam, Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi may cost his party dear when it comes to taking on the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party combine in the state. The Sena chief should keep in mind the price that the National Democratic Alliance paid in the last general elections, after its personal attack on Sonia Gandhi. Politicians have to be careful about not crossing into indecency and slander. Whether the president decides on mercy petitions faster or not, Thackeray should not have indulged in the distasteful attack on the personal style of the first citizen of the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Bal Thackerays attribution of the delay in the presidents decision on Mohammed Afzals mercy petition to his flowing locks was merely a reflection of what ordinary Indian citizens have been feeling for some time. Thackeray should not be taken too seriously. Being a former cartoonist, he perhaps cannot help taking a dig at people, some of which are not in the best of tastes. Given the vast learning and pleasant disposition of the president, he would certainly be able to laugh at Thackerays joke. Meanwhile, the government ought to respect the code of transparency and enlighten the people on the reason for the delay in deciding the fate of Mohammed Afzal. 

 Yours faithfully,

C. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Parting shot

 Sir It is unfair that Sania Mirza should continues to hog the limelight at a time when many important national issues are struggling for media space (Youre the top, Jan 29). Whatever talent Mirza may have had, and may still possess, as a tennis player has been obscured by the media attention. This has affected her focus on the game, while her endorsement contracts have exhausted her. If India wants Mirza to evolve into a genuine tennis champion, certain restrictions should be imposed on her projection as a celebrity. Sourav Ganguly is an example of how a star can turn the medias lack of interest in him, and rejection by the sponsors, to his advantage. Sadly, the media and the industry. seem to remain unaffected by Mirzas on-court performance. The money and the spotlight ensure that she does not need to hone her skills any more. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SHOCKING LOW

 How a society treats its children, its poor and its terminally ill is a certain measure of its level of civilization. On each of these counts, Bengal hit a new and inhuman low recently when a series of government hospitals in Calcutta refused to operate on a seriously ill child because he was found out to be HIV+. Seven-year-old Sheikh Idrish Ali is a thalassaemic patient who got infected by the HIV virus from the blood transfusion he receives regularly from the Central Blood Bank in Manicktala. He now urgently needs a splenectomy done because of the progress of his illness. But surgeons and staff in three city hospitals have sent him away after learning about his HIV status. His father has appealed to the health department, but nothing really has been done about his case by anybody, from the health minister to lesser bureaucrats. What was most barbaric about these powerful people is that all of them made sympathetic noises, bad-mouthed the hospitals, yet explained to the father why such a thing might happen in these hospitals. All they could express was a sort of helpless despair, humanitarian concern and indignation.

 It is deeply shocking that not only some individuals, but an entire state-run healthcare system is being allowed to get away, by the state itself, with ignorance and negligence of such criminal proportions. An underprivileged child with a terminal illness embodies a kind of vulnerability that is inevitably prone to such systemic injustice in India. What this case makes evident is the state of benightedness regarding HIV/AIDS that still prevails in the country in spite of vast amounts of funding private, public and foreign being poured into its HIV/AIDS infrastructure. The fundamental problem remains lack of awareness, and the active forms this might take, ironically, in the behaviour of that section of society which is expected to be best informed about the virus and the risks involved in dealing with the manifestations of AIDS. The legal machinery required to handle such blatant violation of basic human rights is still not in place. This is why such offenses go unpunished and their victims find no redressal at all. If doctors and hospital staff are still perpetuating the worst kind of prejudiced behaviiour regarding HIV/AIDS, there seems to be little hope that the rest of the country might sit up to its actuality in the right spirit.

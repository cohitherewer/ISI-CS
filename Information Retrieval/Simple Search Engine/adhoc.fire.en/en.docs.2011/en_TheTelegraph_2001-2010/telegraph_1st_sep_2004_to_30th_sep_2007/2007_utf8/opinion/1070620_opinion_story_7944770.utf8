 NOT ALL SMILES

 The first citizen of the Indian republic is supposed to be more seen than heard. Pratibha Patil, the United Progressive Alliances candidate for the post, whose geniality and smiling countenance in her increased public appearances make evident that she is preparing herself for her future role, should have kept this fact in mind. As a compromise candidate of the ruling alliance, a fact she cannot delude herself into forgetting, Ms Patil is doubly vulnerable to controversies. By choosing to speak on the history of the purdah at a public function commemorating the birth anniversary of a Rajput hero, the presidential candidate seems to have played right into the hands of her detractors and raised hackles in unexpected quarters. There is, undoubtedly, much substance in her exhortation that women be allowed to come out of seclusion to take part in the countrys progress. However, her insistence that womens isolation was historically necessitated by societys eagerness to protect them from Mughal invaders not only betrays her flawed knowledge of history but also her lack of sensitivity. The first may not seriously jeopardize her candidacy, but the second can. Already, scholars and heads of the minority community have taken serious exception to her simplistic assumptions about Muslim behaviour and Indian history. Since it is too early in the presidential race to rule out the play of mischief, Ms Patils public-speak, something she may not be used to doing, could land her in more trouble.

 However, it is not Ms Patils lack of habit alone that makes her a sitting duck for such controversies. As the probable first woman president of the country, she has raised expectations that otherwise would not have become so keenly associated with the process of electing the ceremonial head. Ms Patil is not only expected to uphold the secular, progressive values so dear to the nation but also supposed to celebrate Indian womanhood. Unfortunately, Ms Patil, with her subscription, at least in form, to traditional notions of modesty (as evident from the severity with which she draws the sari to cover her head), with her commitment to play the archetypal Rajasthani bahu, may steadily seem to fail to live up to those expectations. She must realize that the system of purdah, which she decries, lies intrinsically intertwined with these constructs of womanhood which she wants the society to forget and move ahead.

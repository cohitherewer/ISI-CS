The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HEAD ABOVE

 It is the season for name-dropping. The term of the present president of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, ends in the last week of July and all parties, led by the Congress, are exploring the sensitivities of allies and rivals by cautiously airing names of possible candidates in one anothers hearing. Everyone has something to say. There is an unspoken understanding that the election of the ceremonial head of state should be as dignified as possible, and look as little like a political scramble as a walk on the ramp. The point of consensus, or almost-consensus, is that the individual elected by the electoral colleges is symbolically above all politics, being the upholder of the Constitution. Inherited from the British, the Indian Constitution has accepted a bicameral system in which the president takes the place of the sovereign. Nothing could be further from the presidential system of government, yet there is often some confusion. The presidents presence is ceremonial, yet to get to that position, he has had to be supported by politicians, or he may be a veteran party-man himself. The anomaly shows from time to time.

 Mr Kalams recent remarks in parliament regarding the necessity of a two-party system emerging out of Indias present multi-party one is one such time. The context of the Uttar Pradesh elections loaded this speech with political significance. But even without this context, the remarks are troubling. Mr Kalam is not just a president; he is a scientist, a man with ideals, hopes and opinions, and he has his own vision of an emergent India. But the formal position he occupies, and the role he has in parliament, presuppose the complete effacement of the individual. It is not a question of whether the president is right or wrong: those are matters of argument, opinion, politics and the perception of history. It is simply that the president should refrain from commenting on political and politicized issues. By becoming president, an individual surrenders the right to air his opinion, however worthy, in formal circumstances. It is also a question of the dignity of the chair. Different political parties have taken up the presidents remarks in celebration or criticism. That is hardly desirable. It is, perhaps, especially difficult to resist teleological visions in that chair, but the dignity of the president of India resides in its symbolic resonance alone.

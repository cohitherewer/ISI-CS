 Daughters in peril 

Disappearing daughters

 Sir While India is busy projecting the election of Pratibha Patil to the post of president as a remarkable step in the direction of womens empowerment, the report, Son-struck Mother India (July 29), reveals the reality of womens lives in India. Take for instance, the story of Sunita Rajput and her husband, Rajesh. It is unthinkable that Rajesh forced Sunita to abort six times during nine years of marriage because each time she had conceived a daughter. In between the abortions, Rajesh also tortured Sunita for her failure to give birth to a son. This particular case also shows how vulnerable the girl child is in India she is often denied the chance to live and even if she survives, she has to suffer abuse. It is a pity to note that while most men make every effort to constrict womens lives, they seldom protest against the perpetrators of crimes such as eve-teasing, molestation or rape. The law-enforcers too prefer to turn a blind eye to cases of violence against women. In this case, the police had told Sunita that her husband had committed no heinous crime. The situation can improve only if all the women holding positions of power in the government cut across party-lines and pass legislations to protect their less fortunate sisters. 

 Yours faithfully,

Alokananda Bhattacharyya, Guwahati

 Sir The report, Son-struck Mother India, tells a story the likes of which one gets to hear often in India. Hence, the news item hardly merited front-page coverage. Besides, one wonders if The Telegraph itself is not son-struck, considering the caption below the picture of Naomi Watts called her first-time lucky, apparently for having given birth to a baby boy (Watts gives birth to baby boy, July 28).

 Yours faithfully,

Swagata Dasgupta, Kharagpur 

 Sir There are increasing incidents of women being assaulted for failing to have sons. Such offences stem from a general misconception, which holds women responsible for the gender of a newborn. The state governments should start educational campaigns, especially in the rural areas, to make people aware of the scientific facts behind conception. People need to be told that the mother has nothing to do with the type of chromosome that impregnates the ovum that determines a babys gender. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir The mindset that causes a man to torture a woman for conceiving a daughter can only be termed medieval. Hence, the punishment that the man deserves for this crime should be appropriately medieval. Such men can be cured of their chauvinism only if they are publicly flogged and then starved for weeks.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Kumar, Calcutta

 Sir It is ironical that women are being persecuted for conceiving daughters when it has been proved that the sex of the foetus does not depend on the mother. Even men who are aware of this truth choose to ignore it because it is easier to shift the blame on the mother rather than take responsibility for the girl child. It is surprising that the wife is tormented for the gender of the baby even in families that are comparatively well-off. This reality points towards the gender prejudices that are operative in India. The illogical preference for the male child makes society abuse a Sunita Rajput even as a Sunita Williams conquers space. 

 Yours faithfully,

Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir While India takes pride in its progress, one should pause to reconsider the meaning of modernity, especially in the context of the lives of women like Sunita Rajput. A few glitzy malls strewn across the metros do not make a globalized nation. So long as the minds of Indians are so bigoted as to make them kill girl children in their mothers wombs, India cannot lay any claim to modernity.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Sir Rituals are a central feature of most religions in India. However, very often, in their execution, rituals look more like a display of public frenzy than of sincere devotion. The Indian diaspora in Wales adopted an aggressive stance when it raised a ruckus over the killing of the bull named Shambo,which had contracted bovine tuberculosis (India hands off Shambo, July 27). Any government with claims to sanity anywhere in the world would put down an infected creature to avoid the spread of the disease. But the Indian community in Wales failed to see the point of the decision. Unfortunately, this particular incident has given the Welsh authorities a taste of the religious fundamentalism that certain Hindu sects have become synonymous with. The protests that were aired to prevent the sick animal from being taken to the slaughter house confirms nonetheless that years of living outside the country have not cut the Indian diaspora from its roots. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Sinha, Berhampore, Khagra 

 Sir The Skanda Vale community centre in Wales has lost its fight to keep Shambo alive (Confirmed: Shambo dead, July 28). The Hindus might have succeeded in their campaign had they been able to enlist the support of the local people and officials to their cause. This would have been ensured if the temple community had been better integrated with the local Welsh population. 

 Yours faithfully,

Richard Bartley, Clwyd, Wales

 Sir Shambos death left me saddened. The Welsh government should at least have allowed Shambo to be deported to India. What were the Indian authorities in the United Kingdom doing while the controversy over Shambo raged? Moreover, a worldwide organization like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals remained a mute spectator throughout the episode. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mohammad Hashim, Calcutta

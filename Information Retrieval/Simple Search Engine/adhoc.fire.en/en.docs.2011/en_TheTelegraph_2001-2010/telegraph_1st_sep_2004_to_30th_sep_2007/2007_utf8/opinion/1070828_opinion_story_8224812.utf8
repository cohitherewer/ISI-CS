 TIME FOR A DECISION 

 MALA 

 FIDE - Malvika Singh

 What a hullabaloo over what Ronen 

 Sen is supposed to have said about the opposition of the 

 Left to the deal, as it is now called! What is sickening 

 and truly distasteful, if only because it sums up the moral 

 and intellectual level of our parliamentarians and leaders, 

 is the fact that there was not even a whimper from them 

 when one of their tribesmen threatened, in public, to kill 

 the Bangladeshi author, Taslima Nasreen. Under the law in 

 a civilized nation, anybody threatening to kill another 

 human being must be arrested to prevent a possible premeditated 

 murder. Why has no parliamentarian reacted strongly and 

 definitively to this open challenge? Are they only concerned 

 about their own little, precious, private and irrelevant 

 worlds? In another instance, George Fernandes called the 

 prime minister of India a liar. This kind of crude retort 

 is unacceptable to decent citizens. It is crass and embarrassing 

 for anyone who lives by correct social norms and manners. 

 Partymen and -women might use such language at home with 

 their families or behind closed doors in party offices but 

 not in the public domain. It is these instances of disgraceful 

 behaviour, and the constant use of unwarranted language 

 tempered with undignified adjectives, that are shameful. 

 These are bound to send a substantial number of members 

 of the Indian political class into the dustbin of history 

 as a new generation starts to vote. 

 Great leveller

 After having reduced political 

 and ideological discourse to the lowest depths possible, 

 it is becoming virtually impossible for the majority of 

 our representatives in the parliament and the state assemblies 

 to hold a positive brief. It has become a vicious circle 

 degraded politics nurturing degraded individuals with 

 degraded ideas and aspirations. The damning of the sanctity 

 of the parliament by consistent adjournments triggered by 

 impetuous walk-outs is inexcusable. To play around with 

 the taxpayers money in this fashion is irresponsible and 

 reckless. To demean those who have different views with 

 abusive words and unseemly action is senseless and has a 

 terrible impact on the social fabric of a great civilization. 

 Greed for money and power, as well as other forms of greed 

 in its broadest possible definition, could well be the basis 

 for this degeneration of ethics in the class that rules 

 us. It is distasteful and nauseating. 

 This reality becomes even more 

 disturbing when one sees and meets the new incumbents in 

 the political arena young men and women with the desire 

 to rejuvenate a tired and decrepit class of older colleagues 

 who failed to create even the bare minimum infrastructure, 

 just the basics for a dignified life, over sixty long years. 

 The administrative service that, in its early years, maintained 

 rule of law, civil order and some semblance of appropriateness, 

 has, over the years, degenerated along with the political 

 class it serves. The people became secondary and mass needs 

 were neglected. The real mandate of the bureaucracy was 

 replaced by a limited directive, one that efficiently 

 took care of the exclusive requirements, both professional 

 and personal, of the leadership at the cost of the nation. 

 Demoralization has led to anger and often, militant assault. 

 Corrupt practices have permeated 

 into every crevice. If you are honest, you are deemed a 

 misfit. In fact, honesty and integrity bring in their wake 

 ominous threats from those who rule our lives because they 

 upset the balance, question the comfort of the status 

 quo and defy the complacent authority. Indians have 

 learned to lead this corroded life that affects all citizens, 

 poor, middle level and rich, in different measures. In sixty 

 years, corruption, not dignity, has been the great leveller. 

 The baton must pass hands and 

 civil society must be restored.

 POLITICAL MEDICINE FOR ECONOMIC ILLS

 The budget will neither curb inflation soon nor sustain the present growth rates, writes S.L. Rao

 Price of growth

 Indians are now almost arrogantly convinced of a sustainable 9 per cent (soon rising to 10) per annum rate of growth. The Finance Minister proudly took credit that the UPA government achieved the XI Plan growth targets on an average in the first three years. The hype is reminiscent of the NDA government with India Shining.

 The Economist (of February 3) pointed out the rising prices, high budget deficits, lack of surplus industrial capacity, racing commercial credit, widening current account deficit, four-fold rise in share prices in four years and a timid response from the Reserve Bank of India. It mentions that while entrepreneurial initiative has been unleashed, the public sector is in a sorry state, with many public services having worsened. Water is short, as is power. There is high illiteracy, especially among women, and the infrastructure is in a bad state. It argues that uncertain quality of the statistics makes it likely that growth has so far been only about 7 per cent. The Economist does not consider black economy involved in production, which will probably cancel this and leave the 9 per cent figure intact.

 The NDA governments euphoria lost it the election. It mistook selective growth (mainly urban, industrial goods, middle classes) as being universal and sustainable. It was neither. The UPA, despite attempts to give growth a more social and equitable look, is falling into the same trap. Budget deficits remain high. They would be higher if there were a much lower inflation of around 3 per cent of earlier years. Inflation has reached 7 per cent. Commentators, who say that they would rather have 9 per cent growth with 7 per cent inflation than less growth, assume that we have the instruments for carefully calibrating both to keep inflation within limits. They do not appreciate that the poor are worst hit. 

 On inflation, the budget follows the prime ministers precept of controlling inflation without sacrificing growth. It claims that supply constraints drive inflation and not excess demand or liquidity. The RBI disagrees. It has curbed demand by reducing liquidity and raising interest rates. It has not prevented foreign fund inflows from adding to domestic liquidity. Such inflows are growing. The budget tries to tackle inflation by measures such as reducing duties on petrol and diesel (anticipated by the earlier reduction in their prices). It reduces import duties and has novel retail price-based excise duties on cement. These will not reduce prices because world prices also are high (with petroproducts, the measures were implemented in anticipation). Rising prices of pulses, vegetables, onions and cereals affect the common man most. The budget does not help reduce them. Better targeting of subsidized products, so they reach the poor, is old and unimplemented talk. The budget has substantial programmes for agriculture, which, if successful, should improve production and productivity over the next three years. There is little in the budget that will bring prices down. 

 It tries to deal with infrastructure by putting in more money, using foreign exchange reserves and some tax concessions. It does not deal with ineffective implementation, especially under the UPA, of the Golden Quadrilateral and the rural road programmes. It does not recognize that privatization of power distribution in Delhi has kept prices of electricity lower than elsewhere, reduced transmission and distribution losses with better quality of power. It gives no strong signals and incentives for privatization, the only way in which power supply can match demand. The Jawaharlal Nehru urban renewal programme will, with other programmes, improve infrastructure but not power.

 This budget scores, like its predecessor, with its emphasis on education, health, scheduled castes and tribes and minorities. The rural employment guarantee scheme is, despite its shortcomings corruption, improper targeting, insufficient coverage and so on a good programme, and its extension is welcome. There is no mention of lessons learnt to make it more effective. 

 The budget addresses employment led growth with stimulants for tourism and other services. It could have given incentives to manufacturing for additional employment. However, direct employment in manufacturing will not solve our employment problems. Employment will increase in self- and casual employment. By providing ample funds for education and training, the budget addresses the issue of declining quality of the workforce and thus safeguards the future.

 On the fiscal front, inflation and growth have together enabled achievement of fiscal deficit targets. However, the governments debt remains excessive. It can come down only if expenditures on government employment, subsidies and defence are brought down. The budget does not do this. Indeed, the appointment of the new pay commission promises another round of escalating staff expenditures at all levels in governments. 

 Will growth continue at 9 per cent? With the impending decline in the world economy, rising commodity prices, world-wide inflation, Indias own inflation and effects on liquidity and interest costs and housing and consumer finance, growth will fall. However, efficient administration of government spending could soon bring gains in agriculture, infrastructure, health and education. Spending will boost purchasing power and domestic demand. Growth could revive after 12 to 15 months.

 Our top priority must be radical reform of the administrative system, in number, training, specialization, performance orientation, succession planning based on performance, and tenures in one job. Governance in teaching institutions, health services, and so on, must improve and be made accountable. Regulatory institutions must function with greater vigour, and follow-up with penalties for violation by the regulated entities.

 Inflation and the current account deficit are threats that can derail growth. The poor have no alternative to food staples like onions, vegetables and daal. Price rises of expensive items like cars and white goods may reflect the income effects of wealth, that is, people feeling richer because of the boom in share prices and property values, and borrowing to buy better cars or other goods. This wealth effect is also a sign of inflation in property and share values.

 The government must act in crisis mode to improve agricultural investment, penalize fake and substandard inputs in seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, provide insurance, improve quality of health, education and water, regulate ground water use and so on. These cannot wait for a leisurely administrative effort.

 This budget will do little to curb inflation within this year. It will also not sustain the present growth rates. Growth could revive after a year or so if administration improves.

 Not afraid of the dark

When darkness falls

 Sir It is difficult to imagine that the Karnataka government had thought it fit to pass a regressive legislation banning women from working in night shifts (Night out of Karnataka womens lives, May 11). Under intense public pressure, the government has been forced to consider its withdrawal. It is obvious that under the ruse of ensuring womens safety, such bills make employers and employees potential violators of the law. The government should take steps to increase security on the streets instead of making employers responsible for the safety of their women employees. 

 Karnatakas labour minister, Iqbal Ansari, had apparently sought to reinforce the already existing Shops and Establishments Act, 1961, which prohibits women from working at night. But these laws, if implemented, will only encourage groups that are intent on curbing womens rights. Womens sense of freedom will be curtailed considerably if they are not allowed to work after eight. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir Women working in the media and the hospitality industry have been doing night shifts for the last few decades. They have faced several problems on their way back home at night. But, then, have not their male colleagues confronted difficulties too? To provide special protection to women is to acknowledge that they are the weaker sex, and hence perpetuate their subordination. If a woman opts for a job that requires her to work till late hours then she must be prepared to face any inconvenience that might arise. The government can help her by making the cities safer. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Karnatakas labour minister, Iqbal Ansari, who believes that law prohibiting women from working on night shifts would assure their safety, should be told that crime against women does not take place only after sunset. There have been numerous cases of assault, molestation, even rape, taking place in broad daylight. It is more important that the system of vigilance is improved.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir It is a matter of disgrace that both the Central and the state governments of India have not yet been able to guarantee womens safety on the streets. The risk faced by women increases after dark, compounded by the absence of adequate police patrol. In this situation, a law that enables women to return home before the streets get more dangerous would have been of much help. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Kumar, Calcutta

 Learning from students

 Sir The principals of 16 colleges affiliated to the Calcutta University who gheraoed the office of the university vice-chancellor have degraded themselves by doing so (Principals give CU first gherao gift in 150 years, May 16). Their shameful behaviour also besmirches the reputation of the old and honoured institution. The principals have set such a bad precedent that now it will be difficult to condemn students who gherao college principals and their teachers. Gyanankur Goswami, principal of Shyamaprasad College, is believed to have said that they were insulted by the way the vice-chancellor, Asis Kumar Banerjee, treated them when they had demanded to know the reason behind the delay of an inquiry report probing the suspension of Kalachand Saha, the principal of Andul College. Even if this is true, the heads should have responded in a more civilized manner. 

 Besides, there may be more to the allegations than what meets the eye. Saha was the general-secretary of the West Bengal Council of College Principals, of which Goswami is the president. Saha was suspended when he had allegedly slapped a teacher of his college. After Sahas suspension, the council had lodged a complaint with the university, opposing the order and demanding an inquiry. There is no doubt that the council wields immense power, controlled as it is by the ruling party of the state. Perhaps it is this fact, which gave the council members the audacity to gherao Banerjees office. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir The reason cited by the principals for their sit-in in front of the office of Asis Kumar Banerjee does not hold water. The grievance against the alleged delay in disclosing the findings of an inquiry report could have been addressed to the syndicate, which is the highest policy-making body of the university, or to the chancellor. In situations such as these, a redressal is easily available under the Right to Information Act. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Barasat

 Sir The behaviour of the 16 principals of reputed colleges is symptomatic of the indiscipline that has vitiated the educational set-up in West Bengal. Students and teachers no longer have any respect for their superiors. Principals would rather take recourse to means normally adopted by unruly students than petition the vice-chancellor. And the vice-chancellor should also have known better than treating the college heads in a brusque manner, as alleged. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

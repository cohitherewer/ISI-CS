 PACKING UP

 Fallen rulers, especially of the dictatorial kind, routinely go into exile. That is not quite the case with either Begum Khaleda Zia or Sheikh Hasina Wajed. They would like to stay on in the country that they ruled at different times as prime ministers. They are being forced into exile by the army-backed government in Dhaka so that a new political order can be introduced in Bangladesh. Unprecedented as the events in the country are, they carry a message for rulers everywhere. When they rise to power, politicians delude themselves into thinking that they can never fall. The delusion leads them to subvert systems in order to perpetuate their rule. Political opinion in Bangladesh is sharply polarized on which of these two leaders is to blame more than the other for reducing it to a failed state. But few can doubt that the country has slipped into a near-total anarchy during the alternating regimes of Ms Wajed and Ms Zia. They proved to be incapable of ruling the country. The party system in Bangladesh was reduced to an ugly show of mutual hatred between the two. Worse still, corrupt politicians abused the system in the name of the two leaders. Endless shutdowns, violence and the rise of Islamist extremists ruined the countrys economic and social stability.

 When the people desperately want a clean-up of the system, they would usually go with whoever promises to do it. That explains why the actions of the interim administration in Dhaka have met with public approval. If the banishment of some leaders can save a country from chaos, the people may actually welcome it. But the administration in Dhaka has to prove that it has no other motive for forcing Ms Zia and Ms Wajed out of the country. So far, its actions have indicated its commitment to rid the country of corrupt politicians and religious extremists. So long as it lives up to this promise, the caretaker government can hope to win the support and sympathy of the international community. Even seemingly undemocratic steps are sometimes needed to halt a dangerous drift. However, the people do not distinguish between a political ruler and a non-political one if the rule becomes oppressive. The present rulers of Dhaka must not squander the popular support they have won so far. They must eventually give back to the people the freedoms that the politicians had stolen from them.

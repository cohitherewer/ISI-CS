 BET ON RAINFALL

 The clich about Indian agriculture being a gamble on the monsoon should perhaps be rephrased. Indian agriculture has become a gamble on predictions made by the India Meteorological Department. Every year, around this time, the meteorological department puts out its forecast for the coming monsoon season. This makes hearts sink or spirits rise. In all honesty, these figures are pretty useless since they are updated in June. This means that the figures for projected rainfall and the coming of the monsoon arrive too late to help the planning and preparation process. There is also the more fundamental point that the impact of the monsoon on Indian agriculture has declined from what it used to be at one time. If one were to look at the production of the rabi harvest, it would turn out to be equal to the kharif one. The comparative irrelevance of the monsoon can be demonstrated with another set of figures. In 2005-06, monsoon rainfall was 99 per cent and agricultural growth was six per cent. The next year, or the fiscal year just gone by, rainfall was 100 per cent but agricultural growth had fallen to about 3 per cent. Obviously, factors other than the monsoon are determining the rate of agricultural growth.

 There are two conclusions that suggest themselves. One is to stop the entire business of monsoon predictions and all that jazz. But this would be throwing the baby out with the bath water in a fit of pique. The other is to look at alternative modes of forecasting that will make planning and preparation possible. The meteorological department is already taking the necessary steps by incorporating more parameters to fine-tune the prediction of weather and rainfall. The new parameters will make possible region-wise projections. Steps are also in place to move to a dynamic forecasting system. But these are all in the stage of experimentation. They need validation before their predictions can be relied upon and be acted upon. For the moment, predictions about the monsoon have an element of unreliability built into them. Thus, the forecast that in the current monsoon season total rainfall is going to be 95 per cent of the long-term average means something and nothing, depending on whether one is a believer or a cynic. Indian agriculture is, therefore, a gamble in faith faith in the monsoon as well as faith in predictions.

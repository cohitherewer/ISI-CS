 DARKNESS VISIBLE AND BECKONING

 India should not squander the advantages it has over China in securing a position of influence in Africa, writes, Deep K. Datta-Ray

 Profit from the company

 There is a message for India in the comment of the French defence minister, Michele Alliot-Marie, that the flip side to Chinas highly successful economic engagement with Africa includes a burgeoning small-arms trade which exacerbates internecine conflicts, hinders the spread of political freedoms and compounds instability in a continent that desperately needs to concentrate on re-construction. We do not mind a great country coming to help development in Africa, so long as it happens in clear conditions that encourage development and democracy, she told the French Senate.

 That statement recalls a neglected Indian obligation that Jawaharlal Nehru mentioned in 1955. Even now, he told the Bandung Conference of Afro-Asian nations, the tragedy of Africa is greater than that of any other continent, whether it is racial or political. It is up to Asia to help Africa to the best of her ability because we are sister continents. Sadly for India and also for Africa the wish led nowhere. The constant travels of Chinas veteran foreign minister, 66-year-old Li Zhaoxing, who is once again on an African jaunt to kick-start a new round of development for China-Africa relations, show that Beijing is not allowing the grass to grow under its feet.

 Competition is not only about winning friends and votes at the United Nations. The role of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, for instance, has been expanded since it was formed in 2001 for resolving central Asian border disputes, intelligence-sharing and counter-terrorism. The SCO has had international-relations experts gushing, since many predict that a unipolar world dominated by the United States of America would be replaced sooner rather than later by a multipolar one. Now, while Hu Jintao justifies increased military spending by referring to his countrys historical mission, Victor Bulmer-Thomas, outgoing director of Britains Royal Institute of International Affairs, says that China is more likely than India, the European Union or the Russian Federation to emerge as a megapower by 2020. 

 Africa could be a major theatre for exerting influence. The continent is rich in the energy resources that are desperately needed by both India and China, the two fastest growing economies of the world. However, India can offer African nations a mix of growth economics and political freedoms, which China cannot. China has been successful in securing a major opening in Africa after the ideologically driven initiatives of the Fifties and Sixties (like a Tanzanian railway and arms sales to Mozambique) petered out. But India did not make use of its opportunities. It left the door open to Beijing, explains Carolyn Bartholomew of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. The commission advises the US Congress, that is eager to embrace dangerous and or unsavoury regimes in order, among other goals, to secure access to oil.

 The Wests sanctimonious boycott of many African regimes after nearly a century of extreme colonial exploitation left Africa in the grip of oppressive rulers looking for new political sponsors, arms-sellers and trading partners. That amounted to an abdication of the developed Wests responsibility to one of the worlds least developed regions. For, as the US and Europe know full well, boycotts do not remove vicious regimes, rather, they allow elites to become even more entrenched, while the masses suffer privation. The Darfur killings continue; Robert Mugabe still rules Zimbabwe. That is why, when Beijing beckoned, the leaders of 48 of Africas 53 nations came. Many of them are looking for a way to reconcile their flag-of-convenience loyalty to Taiwan with Chinas seductive offer. 

 The Beijing jamboree of African leaders and their Chinese hosts was historic as well as historical. Historic because China has succeeded in becoming the pre-eminent power in Africa and its second biggest trading partner. Historical because modern Chinese diplomacy draws on the Middle Kingdoms ancient formula: the tribute system. It was how the Son of Heaven brought those nations whom the Celestial Empire called barbarians into his imperial trading and, through it, cultural and political system. The richly laden convoys from Burma, Korea, Laos and other nations that old China regularly received were in fact trade delegations though it suited the vain self-image of the Manchu emperors to view them as tributary missions. The convoys returned home with goods that were more valuable than the often paltry gifts they had brought, and the process established lines of trade and communication which in turn brought the farther reaches of Asia within Chinas cultural and political ambit.

 The same diplomacy has now been packaged in a modern way. Contemporary Chinas economic penetration of Africa heralds a new era of cultural and political ties. Although the Chinese foreign minister sought to reassure the world by saying, Our cooperation is not designed to be against or preclude any third party, this is patently untrue in a world of finite resources. Once the Chinese are established in a country, no one else gets a foothold. Myanmar is a prime example. China knows that the hunt for energy is a zero-sum game, which is why the ageing Li has visited 47 of the 53 African nations. If India is to maintain a foothold on the African continent, it must move now before Africa becomes Chinas handmaiden.

 Along with investing in Africas human capital, China has outlined a strategic investment plan to build three to five trade and economic co-operation zones in Africa by 2009 to boost trade, which is expected to top $40 billion this year. That could double to $80 billion by 2010 on the back of an insatiable demand for oil and mineral resources to feed Chinas booming economy. A two-fold effect on Africa is expected. First, tangible improvement to the human condition, as the Chinese train 15,000 African professionals over the next three years. China will also set up a $5 billion-fund to encourage Chinese companies to invest in Africa. Its assistance will create jobs for millions of unemployed Africans. Second, strong cultural ties with China will develop. No wonder Hu Jintao and Mugabe toasted an unshakeable friendship while the presidents of Liberia and Guinea Bissau shopped at Ji Mingrens store at the Silk Market. 

 But inevitably, given the nature of Chinese assistance, political freedoms will languish further. For this trade and aid comes without ethical constraints. China rejects UN plans for a peacekeeping force in Darfur and blocks UN resolutions to pressure the Khartoum regime over the atrocities there because it has acquired 40 per cent of Sudans oil-production facilities. It must be admitted that Chinas economic involvement helps to improve African lives more than pious Western sanctions, but at what cost?

 Since the Western powers, riding a moral high horse, will not take a realistic view of African needs, it is up to India to counter the Chinese behemoth. India also needs oil and raw materials. It enjoys advantages that China does not: the large Indian business community throughout Africa, especially in South Africa, Kenya and Tanzania, can provide an opening. Nehru thought that the whole world owes it to the African people not to hinder them, but to help them in freedom in every way. 

 The Pravasi Bharatiya Divas should turn away a bit from high-profile entrepreneurs in the US and court ordinary Indian folk in Africa. They can serve India by serving Africa. Chinese self-interest may provide economic freedom, but only democratic India can provide the African people with the political choices that could ensure freedom in every way.

 EXPECTED HIKE

 The hike in the repo rate (the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India lends to banks) by 0.25 percentage points was widely expected by the markets. That is why bond prices rose after the announcement, as traders had priced in the rate-hike and were relieved that the RBI had not been harsher. The writing on the wall was very clear: inflation is at a two-year high, credit has been growing at over 30 per cent, the economy is growing at 9 per cent, industrial growth is at 14.4 per cent, money supply is growing at over 20 per cent, and real-estate prices are shooting through the roof all signs of very strong demand. And as the old adage goes, it is the job of the Central bank to take away the punch bowl just when the party is getting started. Moreover, with state elections round the corner, even the finance ministry, which earlier used to sing a different tune, has come around to the RBI s view that rate hikes are a must to curb inflation. 

 It is true that the rise in agricultural prices is a major reason for inflation, but the wholesale price index also shows that manufacturing prices are inching up. And although the RBI cannot do much about the prices of foodgrains or pulses, which are supply-driven, it can keep a lid on inflationary expectations by raising rates and contain some of the demand pressures that are contributing to the build-up of inflation. At the same time, there are certain sections of the economy that are clearly getting overheated. The policy statement says that the continued high credit growth in the real estate sector, outstanding credit card receivables, loans and advances qualifying as capital market exposure and personal loans is a matter of concern. Accordingly, banks will now be required to make higher provisions on their loans to these sectors. Further, so that banks do not finance these sectors indirectly through non-banking financial companies, the provisioning and risk weightage requirements on bank-funding for NBFCs too have been raised. 

 The effect of these measures will be that the cost of funds for banks lending to these sectors will now increase, and since banks will pass on these cost-increases to the customer, loans to these sectors will become more expensive. Note that loans for residential housing do not attract these higher provisions the target is loans to builders and contractors. Nevertheless, the repo rate hike will make loans more expensive across the board. The lagged effect of earlier tightening measures are slowly being felt interest rates have already gone up in the past few months. The rate-hike is an attempt to continue to dampen inflationary expectations and cool off demand till new capacities come on stream.

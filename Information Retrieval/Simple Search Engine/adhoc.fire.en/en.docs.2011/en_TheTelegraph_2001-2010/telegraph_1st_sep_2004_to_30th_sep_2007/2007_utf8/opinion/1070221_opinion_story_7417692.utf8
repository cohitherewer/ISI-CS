 CREEPING UP

 The economic climate has been benign in recent years. The growth rate has accelerated, inflation has been low by our standards and capital inflows have exceeded the payments deficit. In these circumstances, making the budget has not required any macroeconomic skills. A finance minister may have faced unreasonable demands from his party; but even these could be accommodated since revenue growth was buoyant. There was no need to fiddle with tax rates; their stability robbed the budget of public interest. 

 This favourable environment has recently undergone a subtle change: inflation has begun to creep up. The Reserve Bank of India was the first to raise an alarm; it followed up its warnings with increases in its nodal rates as well as in the cash reserve ratio. The finance ministry was slower to react; the finance minister has been known to be a growth hawk and has been reluctant to spoil the party. But he receives the latest figures of inflation every week; he could not ignore them forever. So, in recent weeks, he has reduced some import duties, hoping thereby to bring down the cost of imports. But he has not done the obvious thing and reduced the astronomical import duties on agricultural goods whose prices have been rising fastest. The Congress would not let him dent its claim to be the farmers friend. It matters little to it that by maintaining the high agricultural tariffs initially imposed by the National Democratic Alliance government, it has made Indian farmers incapable of competing internationally and thereby shut them out of the world market, which is thirty times as big as the Indian market.

 Further, the inflation is no longer entirely supply-driven. Prices cannot rise unless supply of something cannot respond to a rise in demand; in this sense, all inflation is supply-driven. An unduly rapid rise in aggregate demand may, however, lead inflation to spread across commodities and services; beyond a point, it will become general enough to be termed demand inflation. Although it started in agricultural commodities, inflation has now spread to manufactures. The only group in which inflation is falling is mineral oil products, which follow their own international cycle. The sustained macroeconomic growth has thus led to widespread capacity bottlenecks and the emergence of demand inflation. Hence, the forthcoming budget must be a disinflationary one: it should bring down and possibly eliminate the fiscal deficit. That gives Mr P. Chidambaram two basic choices. He can be a good socialist and raise taxes. His leftist allies would be thrilled if he raises income and corporation taxes. But the better option would be to bring down the growth rate of expenditure. The outcome budgets he introduced give him an indication of which ministries are wasting money or making up fictitious achievements. This year, he has a good reason to deny them money, and to convince taxpayers that he is intent on spending their money wisely.

 TO SET THE HOUSE IN ORDER

 Malvika singh

 Since Prakash Karat is not an elected leader, he cannot debate the pros and cons of the nuclear deal in parliament. He, therefore, uses old-fashioned rabble-rousing and ensures walkouts and suchlike because he is accountable to no one. It would have made more sense to have insisted on a proper debate in the Lok Sabha and the upper house, allowing for a necessary intellectual exercise. But then, I suppose, that is asking for too much from our leaders. Their expertise and skill lie elsewhere. Will the parliament of India, some time in the near future, restore the dignity of the House? Will our democracy, once again, throw up great leaders? Will democracy be strengthened or will this present breed of politicians destroy the fundamental basis of our society and divide India? And, how long will India tolerate this kind of exploitation and brutalization of its ethics and norms of its civilization and diverse cultures?

 Chaos reigns

 The Communist Party of India (Marxist) appears to be in a disarray. It is coming apart at the seams. Does this symbolize a desperation to break away from the rigidity of mind and action? The apparent straining-at-the-leash is usually an indication of the desire to assert ones individuality and show a different and more energetic approach. Established hierarchies always clamp down on any form of resurgence because it disrupts stability and threatens the party structure. Karat, if he is a survivor, should be looking at the fast-developing chinks on the fortified walls of his party and within the ranks. To retain the 60-odd seats in parliament the next time round, the party would require much effort and new thinking. Otherwise the tally could drop to 20 seats. 

 At this point of time and considering what is in the public domain, Karat seems to be the stumbling block, the obstacle in the way of change within that party. Insecure leadership is limited when operating within a larger, more complex context, with its changing compulsions. When pushed against the wall, it tends to indulge in pedestrian tactics of blackmail in order to grab the headlines. 

 Sitaram Yechury makes more sense to the public. This development in the CPI(M) signals the beginning of the end of a phase. How will the party get out of the corner that Karat has painted it into? What will be the tactic? What will happen in Kerala? How will Karat and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee come to terms with each other the latter a practical ruler and the former a politburo functionary? Then what? 

 The nation seems to be infected with a virus called chaos. The leaders, meanwhile, are all hallucinating, playing devious games. However, Manmohan Singh has taken the high ground. He stood apart, dignified and serious when he spoke on the nuclear deal in parliament. He was heckled. The result: his popularity soared and that of his opponents dipped. There is a lesson to be learnt.

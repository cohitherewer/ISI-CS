 Judges rules

 Sir The Supreme Courts stay on the conviction of Navjot Singh Sidhu in a case of culpable homicide will allow the former cricketer to contest the Amritsar by-elections (Moral model saves Sidhu, Jan 24). However, Sidhus conviction in the lower court has not been stopped altogether. It has merely been postponed. No doubt, Sidhu set a high moral standard by resigning from his parliamentary seat, but one cannot forget the consequences of the apex courts decision in favour of a person who, along with his co-accused, had beaten up an old man and left him to die on the road. The stay order may send the wrong signal to the public. Sidhu would have set a better example as a legislator had he been more respectful towards the elderly man he assaulted in the brawl.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir The stay order on the high court conviction of Navjot Singh Sidhu seems to have set an unhealthy precedent. Already, legislators feel much enthused. If a former member of parliament is allowed to contest an election despite being embroiled in a case of culpable homicide, the public may take this as evidence of the high and mighty getting away with murder. Moreover, the apex courts decision is likely to spur others awaiting sentence on similar charges to seek such concessions. Sidhus resignation from the Lok Sabha, immediately after the Punjab and Haryana high courts ruling on the case deserves to be emulated by other legislators, but it does not lessen his guilt. More importance should have been attached to the crime itself and more regard shown for the feelings of the victims family members.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir Navjot Singh Sidhu promptly thanked god for the turn of events. He needs to thank the apex court for its surprise verdict. In the end, the real significance of the courts ruling is that there is no bar on Sidhus contesting the elections. Therefore, it is for Amritsars voters to decide whom to send to parliament a tainted Navjot Singh Sidhu or his opponent, Surinder Singla. Meanwhile, Sidhu should consider whether he would resign again, and on time, if his conviction is upheld. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshobhya, Mysore

 Sir The apex court may not have thought so highly of a former legislator had he tried to influence it by putting on a show of good behaviour. There is no denying that Sidhu made a dignified exit after his conviction. The Supreme Court should be lauded for having made a formal note of Sidhus behaviour. Its judgment shows that good conduct by the accused, not only while serving a sentence but also before the verdict is given, is recognized by the law. Since the court does not hold a personal grudge against the accused, it would be against the spi- rit, if not the letter, of the law to keep him behind bars if he is already reformed. It is all the more unproductive to keep the guilty behind bars if he is useful to society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir Navjot Singh Sidhu indeed behaved like a gentleman by resigning as an MP on the very day the high court pronounced its verdict against him. With the Supreme Courts decision to see his as a rare case, Sidhu is now deservedly free to stand for election. Other scandal-tainted politicians have lessons to learn from the former cricketer. Perhaps the apex court will next consider the case of Sanjay Dutt, who has also shown exemplary behaviour. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Whos in, whos out

 Sir As Ramachandra Guha notes, regionalism promotes hatred against outsiders (Feeling left out, Jan 20). But one cannot ignore the fact that a lack of employment opportunities has forced many to scatter over areas which are already overpopulated. The anger and frustration felt by Mumbaikars and the Assamese for losing space and employment to outsiders are palpable. Unfortunately, the Union and state governments seem to be more interested in pursuing schemes such as the creation of special economic zones than thinking about the plight of migrants who have few opportunities to earn a decent livelihood back home. Many of them become targets of militants. The government must act before the problem further divides the nation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir Ramachandra Guhas comparison of the atrocities carried out by the United Liberation Front of Asom with the activities of other advocates of a peoples right to self-determination is significant. With the exception of Jammu and Kashmir where regionalism is wholly secessionist all other states use the politics of regionalism for electoral gains. Leaders capitalize on popular sentiment and grievances. What the Ulfa has been doing in Assam is dangerous since they have declared war against Indias unity and integrity and against Indias Constitution, which allows citizens to settle in any part of the country. The Ulfa must be vanquished for the well-being of the North-east as well as that of the nation.

 Yours faithfully,

J.B. Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir One wonders how some forms of regionalism can be considered legitimate and others illegitimate when they cause as much bloodshed. India has already seen a lot of divisions on the basis of language and ethnicity. It has seen the creation of new states a decade ago. If India is to preserve its territorial integrity, there is no way it can assent to secessionism of the kind the Nagas or Ulfa want.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Sinha, Calcutta

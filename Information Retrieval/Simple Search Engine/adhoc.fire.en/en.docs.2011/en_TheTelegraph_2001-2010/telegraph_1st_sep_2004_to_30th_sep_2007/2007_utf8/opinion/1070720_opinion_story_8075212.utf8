 Breaking the colonial spell

THE PENGUIN BOOK OF MODERN INDIAN SPEECHES (Rs 595) edited by Rakesh Batabyal is a history of the making of modern India, captured in the ideas and rhetoric of some of the best Indian minds from Surendranath Banerjea to the present day. In 18 sections, the reader moves from Banerjeas 1878 speech on Indian unity to A.B. Vajpayees parliament address on the 1998 nuclear tests. Batabyal argues against the colonial collaborator tag often attached to 19th and early 20th century figures such as Banerjea, Dadabhai Naoroji and Annie Besant by showing how their speeches de-constructed the colonial apparatus. The pre-Independence speeches collected here trace the awakening of the public consciousness against the imperial cast. The wide spectrum Veer Savarkar and M.A. Jinnah juxtaposed in the same section does justice to the diversity within the national movement. For the comparatist, both Gopal Krishna Gokhales seminal 1902 budget speech and Manmohan Singhs path-breaking 1992 one have found a place here.

 EMPERORS OF THE PEACOCK THRONE: The Saga of the Great Mughals (Penguin, Rs 395) by Abraham Eraly is an entertaining and informative tale of the Mughal empire extracted from the authors The Last Spring (1997). Eraly, after all, believes in Simon Schamas aim of bringing a world to life rather than entomb[ing] it in erudite discourse. This volume focuses on the Mughal empire per se, with regional histories limited to their pertinence to Mughal history. In reconstructing the foundation of the empire, its consolidation and decay, Eraly often sets aside his role as a social scientist and imagines everyday details to make the history complete. While he is refreshingly unorthodox, and his narrative captivating, Eraly could have avoided lapsing into contemporary colloquialisms such as Baburs lineage was awesome.

 AN ABC OF INDIAN CULTURE (Mapin, Rs 595) by Peggy Holroyde interprets over 400 Indian concepts and practices. Holroyde studied Hindu and Buddhist philosophy under Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan at Oxford. Subtitled A Personal Padayatra of Half a Century into India, this book uses each entry as a stepping-stone to understand an India always beyond the travellers grasp. Meant for the Western reader interested in a long cultural intercourse with India, the book, however, benefits from Holroydes study that lends it a depth not usually associated with popular encyclopedias. 

DHARAMSALA DIARIES (Penguin, Rs 295) by Swati Chopra is a spiritual travelogue that recounts the authors quest for answers which come only by retreating within oneself. Dharamsala allows her to explore the nature of life through the experiences of visitors and residents. Although every story is not happy, the place provides an environment where the author believes a transcendental wisdom is attainable.

 TOUCHING LIVES (Penguin, Rs 250) by S.K. Das is the less well-known story of how the Indian Space Research Organisation has transformed the lives of poverty-stricken Indians with the help of technology. Das takes us on a journey to meet characters like Muni Raj, a farmer reclaiming unusable land with the Isros help. There are accounts of, say, the revolution Isros Edusat has caused in rural India or of the empowerment of women through the organizations training programmes. Dass unpretentious prose and first-person narrative make the stories touching and educative.

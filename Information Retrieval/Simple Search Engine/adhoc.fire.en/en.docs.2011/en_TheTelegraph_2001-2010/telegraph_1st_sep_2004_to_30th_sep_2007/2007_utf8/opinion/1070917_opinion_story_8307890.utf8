 Letters to Editor

 Exit, pursued by fear

 Sir While the United States of America commemorated 9/11, its dearest political protg in south-Asia, General Pervez Musharraf, was busy with another kind of drama. The episode of banishing Nawaz Sharif from Pakistan provided an entertaining interlude in the otherwise sordid political impasse that has crippled the country (Banish-stan, Sept 11). A military dictator, Musharraf came to power by overthrowing an elected civilian government through a coup. It is hardly surprising that he should now stubbornly resist his rivals entry into the country. Musharraf has made a radical move by deporting Sharif and denying him a chance to contest a fair election. However, it would be unwise for India to feel smug. There is no reason to imagine that Indias relation with Pakistan would be better if Sharif was reinstated. After all, Kargil happened under Sharifs governance. No matter who comes to power in Islamabad, Kashmir is not going to be sorted easily. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee,

 Sir Pervez Musharraf has mastered the art of enacting well-rehearsed dramas. The way he directed the touch-and-go operation at the Islamabad airport could be compared to the finely-crafted plot of a racy thriller. Whats more, the general ensured that technically there was no contempt of court. Sharif was allowed to land on Pakistani soil, and then requested to hand over his passport for emigration, which he refused. In this way, Sharif obstructed his entry himself. Thereafter, he was deported to Saudi Arabia. One wonders why Sharif did not go to the emigration counter himself, in full view of the press and the public, to get his passport inspected. Was he afraid of going to jail or did he intend just to land on Pakistani soil and create a sensation? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The law and order situation seems to have completely failed in Pakistan. Pervez Musharraf is doing whatever he pleases, caring little for what the supreme court has ordered. He does not even care how the followers of Nawaz Sharif would react to his undemocratic gesture. One hopes that Musharraf is brought to justice in the future, and the people of Pakistan find a better leader to guide them.

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar,

 Sir Nawaz Sharif should have been allowed to return to his country and then taken to court for his alleged malfeasance. His return would have strengthened the political process in Pakistan, encouraged other politicians in exile to return and paved the way for what could possibly become one of the most exciting general elections. Now this opportunity has been lost. Sadly, the uncertainty about Musharrafs re-election as president as well as the involvement of foreign powers in Pakistans domestic affairs will perhaps carry on.

 Yours faithfully,

 Look whos talking

 Sir One feels dismayed at the insensitive comments from the Union textile minister, Shankersinh Vaghela, referring to the debt-ridden cotton-growers of Vidharbha as lazy and incompetent (Seeds of death, Sept 11). The Maharastra chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh, added fuel to the fire by calling the farmers dishonest at a recent conference in Akola. Are the miserable farmers, and those concerned for them, to assume that this is the official position of the Maharashtra government, and of the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre? Ironically, the UPA had come to power in the wake of this agricultural crisis? 

 Both Deshmukh and Vaghela should be reproved severely for their inconsiderate statements against the farmers and asked to investigate the crisis more extensively. The total number of suicides in the Vidarbha region in 2007 alone is staggering, and this can be attributed to the governments failure to implement the election guarantees, most importantly the minimum support price for cotton . The actual support price has not come anywhere close to the proposed amount. Moreover, a large number of the cotton procurement centres have been closed down. Little wonder that the farmers are finding it impossible to achieve financial stability. The government is also not taking any sustained steps to promote other dry-land crops and low-input sustainable agriculture despite clear recommendations from activist groups as well as the National Farmers Commission.The main reason behind the crisis is the governments incompetence. It is appalling that the blame should be put on the farmers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Somu Kumar,

 Sir The irresponsible comments of the Maharashtra chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh, and the Union textile minister, Shankersinh Vaghela, have made a mockery of not just representative democracy but also of basic human sensitivities. The ministers description of the cotton farmers as lazy and incompetent is a travesty of the predicament that has forced many of them to take their lives. The government has done little so far to either increase the price of cotton or provide alternative ways of cultivation in the region. The facetious labelling of the farmers as dishonest by Deshmukh is also audacious because the people of India are all too aware of where exactly dishonesty and corruption reside. 

 Yours faithfully,

 WITHOUT CARE

 Ms Renuka Chowdhury, the Union minister of state for women and child development, has her heart in the right place. As part of her unflagging effort to save the girl child, she has enticed parents with cash incentives, and now proposes that the state does their job of parenting for them. The procreators of unwanted girls have been advised to leave their offspring at the cradle provided in any of the district administrative headquarters, and forget their responsibility. The omniscient and omnipotent state would be taking care of them. The scheme, to be taken up by the government in the course of the 11th five-year plan, is supposed to solve two intrinsically-related problems for the country. It is expected to stop parents from considering the murder of their unborn girl child and, thereby, salvage the lopsided sex ratio of the country. Ms Chowdhury cannot be doubted for the nobility of her cause. India is currently at the bottom of the global chart with a ratio of 927 females for every 1,000 males. Even Pakistan and Nigeria fare better. What bothers is Ms Chowdhurys profound faith in the ability of a state that has failed to provide its children even the basic constitutional guarantees of universal primary education and right to life. While pointing an accusing finger at her political rivals for the Nithari killings, Ms Chowdhury, quite obviously, missed the point.

 Yet, as minister for child development, she should have been acutely aware of the drawbacks of institutionalized care for children, particularly that of the kind which is provided in India. The existing state-run homes in the country, which look after children in need of care and protection and in conflict with the law, are overcrowded and lack even the basic facilities. The children, who suffer early deprivation, neither get the individual attention nor the affection they need. Can these homes well-known for their easy accessibility to traffickers be trusted with the responsibility of bringing up more children? How different will be the condition of state-adopted children from such state-cared ones? More important, will a surrogate cradle allow India to address a crime like foeticide, as Ms Chowdhury hopes? At the root of the problem is societys skewed attitude towards women, which can be changed only with the spread of education, awareness and the empowering of women. Why must a social irresponsibility be encouraged to boost the image of an activist-minister?

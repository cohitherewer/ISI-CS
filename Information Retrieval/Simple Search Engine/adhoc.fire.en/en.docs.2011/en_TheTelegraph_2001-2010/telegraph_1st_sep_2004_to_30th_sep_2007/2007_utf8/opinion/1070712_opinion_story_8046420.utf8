The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AVE ROGERI, ALL HAIL! 

 - Borg was like a demigod, Federer is a late Roman emperor 

 MUKUL KESAVAN

 Roger Federer takes the history 

 of his sport seriously, so seriously that this Wimbledon 

 he dressed himself to look like a quotation from its past. 

 Last year, Federer had treated us to an off-white or cream 

 blazer with a gold crest; this time he turned up in something 

 that looked suspiciously like a white suit till you looked 

 closer and saw that the jacket was a blazer because it had 

 piping sewn in along its edges, as well as a monogrammed 

 crest: his initials intertwined in gold. Gold was something 

 of a motif: there were deep gold stripes at the join of 

 the sleeves, a gold Nike Swoosh embroidered on his headband, 

 even gold accents just above the heels of his shoes where 

 the uppers began. 

 So a blazer and a contemporary 

 take on cream flannels coordinated with a discreet V-necked 

 cricket pullover made up Federers opening sartorial statement 

 on court. Opening statement because the blazer, the trousers 

 and the pullover were for show. Federer took them off before 

 he began playing. They were the props for his little magic 

 trick: when he took them off he shape-shifted: from the 

 gentlemanly amateur he turned into the professional athlete. 

 When Nadal and Federer walked 

 on to Centre Court on the day of the final, Nadal led the 

 way, in his three-quarter-length shorts and sleeveless T-shirts, 

 running ahead of Federer, swinging his racket and weaving 

 from side to side like a boxer. Federer strolled in behind 

 his co-star, wearing his period outfit, looking like the 

 human lead in that summer blockbuster, Gatsby vs 

 Godzilla. The history Federer was gesturing at in his costume 

 was tenniss country-house past. He could have been a character 

 out of L.P. Hartleys The Go-Between, a weekend guest 

 at a stately home, tripping into the breakfast room asking 

 Tennis, anyone? expecting some languid lounger to answer 

 his cue and getting Rafa instead. A friend (a fan of Federers 

 style who hates everything about Nadals muscular game) 

 muttered that all that was needed to complete the scene 

 was a leash. 

 I think my friend is jaundiced 

 and rude and wrong. The animal slur is both wicked and inaccurate. 

 True, a Martian umpiring this match might have ruled it 

 a no-contest on the strength of the physical evidence: Federers 

 forearms looked like match-sticks, Nadals forearms looked 

 like someones thighs. But Rafael Nadal doesnt look like 

 an animal he looks like a cartoon. A glance at his arms 

 and I even knew which one: Popeye. 

 My wife and I trembled for Federer, 

 my children rooted for Nadal. We couldnt understand why 

 anyone (apart from a Spaniard) would want Nadal to win, 

 till I made the Popeye connection. They loved Nadal because 

 he looked and dressed and played like some cartoon character. 

 He moved like a superhero, made unlikely drawn-out sounds 

 and had muscles that only a cartoonist would dare draw. 

 It wasnt hard to imagine him inhaling spinach at the change-overs 

 and bounding out, re-charged. He even did odd things that 

 my children fondly call gross, like picking the seat of 

 his shorts out of his... person, as a preliminary to serving. 

 When I made disgusted sounds the third or fourth time he 

 did this, they were impatient. Its just a wedgie! Everyone 

 has them. Now I had a name for his condition, but it didnt 

 change my mind. If I had been Federer, Id have asked for 

 a change of balls every game. 

 Through the long, five-set match, 

 the cameras kept returning to Bjorn Borg in the Royal Box 

 because it was only his second time at Wimbledon since he 

 walked away from tennis more than a quarter of a century 

 ago. He was there to watch Federer equal his record of five 

 Wimbledon titles in a row. The Swiss was born shortly after 

 the Swede retired and tennis pundits have been keen to cast 

 Federer as Borgs heir. One of them thought the two had 

 impassivity in common. 

 He (and everyone else who sees 

 a likeness) was confusing expressionlessness with composure. 

 Borg was expressionless, Federer is composed...till he loses 

 his composure, as he did when HawkEye endorsed Nadals challenges. 

 With his head-banded blond hair, his thin unshaven face 

 and his recessed eyes that seemed to be searching his own 

 innards, Borg looked like a Nordic Spock, a remote, shuttered 

 alien with a pulse rate under forty, who turned up every 

 year to play demi-god amongst the mortals. Once a tournament, 

 after winning championship point, he allowed himself a public 

 display of feeling: he dropped to his knees the better to 

 give thanks to Himself. Then he shook hands with the nominated 

 loser, collected his trophy and left. 

 Federer weeps. This time, by his 

 own admission, he was leaking tears of relieved triumph 

 at 5-2 in the fifth set, one game before he actually won. 

 He endeared himself to everyone with his acceptance speech 

 when he was given the trophy. Federer does lovely interviews 

 afterwards in three languages. He made a charming little 

 speech to Borg on camera when he came to congratulate Federer 

 upon his victory. Federer declared that he had given Borg 

 a Swedish hug, though it wasnt clear that the Swede knew 

 what that was. For the photo-op Federer was all animated 

 charm; Borg worked up a small, quirky smile. 

 Theyre different. Borg, being 

 a god, was content to be worshipped. Federer, being mortal, 

 merely wants to be king and needs to be loved by his people. 

 So Borg dressed to please himself: striped shirts, small 

 shorts and stubble. Roger dresses to wow his subjects. He 

 has the manner of a later Roman emperor, gifted enough and 

 ambitious enough to measure himself against the great Caesars. 

 Like the Romans, he is endearingly grand and not a little 

 vulgar. The little perforated lace-like details in his shirts, 

 the weakness for gold, the gold notches on his off-white 

 kitbag that mark his Wimbledon conquests, are the modern 

 equivalents of the gilt-edged toga. 

 Next year, when he wins (as I 

 hope he will), hell pull on his trousers, pull off his 

 head-band, pull out a laurel wreath and fix it on his head 

 before taking his trophy from the Duke. One with gilded 

 leaves, naturally. To match.

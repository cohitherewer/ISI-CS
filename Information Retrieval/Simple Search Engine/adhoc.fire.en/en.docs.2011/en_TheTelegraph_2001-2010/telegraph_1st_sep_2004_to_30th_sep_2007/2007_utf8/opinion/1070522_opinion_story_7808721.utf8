 GIVE IN AND 

 BE HAPPY 

 MALA FIDE

 Malvika Singh

 In 

 my last column, I had expressed my shock at the manner in 

 which the DMK Union minister, Dayanidhi Maran, was removed 

 and a new one installed. Following close on its heels is 

 another similar situation, where a woman, a widow of a partyman, 

 with no personal political credentials at all, has been 

 appointed Central minister of state for home affairs by 

 M. Karunanidhi! At a time in our contemporary history when 

 civil strife has overwhelmed us, it makes no sense at all 

 for the prime minister to have agreed to hand such a critical 

 portfolio to a political and administrative novice. To think 

 that we are being manipulated thus by the government sends 

 shudders down the spine. 

 These incomprehensible political 

 manoeuvrings, the role of the DMK in deciding who should 

 be placed in the Union cabinet and in which ministry, come 

 across as sheer blackmail. Succumbing to this kind of strong-arm 

 tactic by a member of the coalition only reinforces the 

 rapidly growing belief that the UPA is being manipulated 

 and getting weaker by the moment. Somebody must lead, must 

 persuade, must command awe and respect, and rule the coalition 

 with its diverse allies. To give in is not effective governance, 

 nor is it conducive to trust and faith among partners. Everyone 

 knows why certain key ministries are demanded, but we 

 cannot understand why the demands are rewarded. 

 One such usurped ministry is 

 forests and environment. The natural environment in India 

 has descended into its worst-ever phase during the last 

 three years. It is ironic that the person who had seen the 

 writing on the wall and had therefore put specific laws 

 and acts in place to conserve and protect this valuable 

 resource, Indira Gandhi, was betrayed by this government, 

 led by her own party. It has destroyed all that she had 

 structured meticulously to ensure the revitalization of 

 our forests and natural habitats, because another of UPAs 

 partners, the CPI(M), supports the government from outside 

 but regularly holds it to ransom.

 Good work undone

 As the world closes in on protecting 

 the little that remains of forests, rivers, mountains and 

 deserts, India passes an act to permit tribal communities 

 back into the forests. Land grabs and the timber trade are 

 today a highly lucrative business, and what can be easier 

 than enticing the poor tribals with some small change for 

 enormous private gains? The haves will benefit yet again 

 at the cost of the have nots, and all this blundering 

 only to keep a failed coalition alive for two more years! 

 The cabinet must watch and try to understand the film made 

 by Al Gore, called An Inconvenient Truth. It contains 

 the primary education that its ministers appear to lack. 

 Wherever one looks, there are 

 social disorders and confrontations of one kind or another, 

 some with one lot of baddies against another lot and others 

 where exploited people are trying desperately to be heard 

 by those who govern. When citizens begin to take the law 

 into their own hands, it means that governance has failed. 

 When the Sikh clergy issues orders to close down deras, 

 I am amazed that the government does not intervene immediately. 

 Surely one faction cannot force another faction to close 

 down or sell out. Are we a democratic country or are we 

 a series of little fiefdoms? Where is national governance? 

 Why is this kind of assault on our polity being permitted 

 by the larger authority that is mandated to rule within 

 the laws of our land? 

 Sadly, the UPA has lost the great 

 opportunity it had. If coalition politics was in the way, 

 the Congress should have stepped down and let the partners 

 scramble about like headless chickens trying to grab the 

 spoils elsewhere. A year ago they could have done so with 

 dignity but today, alas, the scene has changed. Have they 

 lost the plot?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Grin and bear it 

The big hit

 Sir The attempted assault on Greg Chappell by Biranchi Moharana, a Kalinga Sena activist, should be strongly condemned (Greg shaken, not stirred after brush with Biranchi, Jan 22). Not only does this incident bring unwarranted disrepute on Indians, but, even more shamefully, exposes the incompetence of the securitymen who failed to prevent Moharana from attacking Chappell. Although Chappell seems to be unharmed, it remains a matter of concern that the security establishment, which fails to stop one man, is responsible for protecting the lives of the players from terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.

 Sir Biranchi Moharana chose an entirely improper mode to protest against the alleged neglect of cricketers from Orissa while selecting the national squad. He should have remembered that players are selected on the basis of their performance, and performance alone. Nothing can be achieved by taking out ones frustration on the coach, Greg Chappell. Such incidents bring shame upon Indians. Whatever may be the official statement of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, this incident was indeed a breach of security, a recurrence of which should be prevented at any cost.

 Yours faithfully,

Saurik Ginoria,

 Sir The misdemeanour by Biranchi Moharana, and the lapse of security at the Bhubaneswar airport, were unfortunate, especially since the Kalinga Sena had already planned a demonstration against Greg Chappell outside the airport. It did not take long for the blame-game to begin. The BCCI was quick to accuse the state government, the police blamed the media, and so on. The question, however, is: why should such an incident take place at all? If deserving players from a particular state are not selected to the national side, then there is certainly reason to smell fish. But I think a number of Indians have begun to feel that Chappell gets away with whatever he does, and that too with the tacit support of the BCCI. Not many have forgotten the finger incident and how Chappell was spared censure for it. His highhandedness, be it in dealing with the media or the public, has always been indulged. So maybe, Chappell should share the blame, along with the board, for the latest incident.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Few Indians are pleased with Greg Chappell. But there are various ways of expressing ones displeasure. Biranchi Moharanas wasnt exactly the best among them. Being the coach of the Indian cricket team, Chappell is, after all, representing the interests of this country. He might not have succeeded in improving the standards of Indian cricket, but that does not turn him into an enemy of the nation.

 Yours faithfully, 

Purushottam Shrivastva,

 Sir Biranchi Moharanas slap did not sting Greg Chappell as much as it hurt the Indian tradition of hospitality. Chappell is a foreigner after all, and as such, a guest of the country. Moharanas thoughtless act has damaged Indias reputation of being warm and generous towards all visitors.

 Sir The media, by conducting a vilification campaign against Greg Chappell, have turned him into a symbol of national hatred. Foreign coaches will henceforth be sceptical about signing a contract with the Indian cricket board. The incident at the Bhubaneswar airport also reveals the sorry state of security arrangements in India. This is why terrorists have little problems when they want to launch an attack. Biranchi Moharana needs to be informed that if Orissa cricketers have been neglected, then it is the selectors who are to blame, and not the coach, who cannot decide the structure of the team on his own. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The editorial, Hit and run (Jan 24), has rightly called Biranchi Moharanas slapping of Greg Chappell one of the ugliest instances of regional jingoism. However, even The Telegraph is afflicted with a rather bad form of this malaise. How else do you explain a photograph of Sourav Ganguly on the front page everyday, irrespective of whether he scores 98 or 13? The display of regional bias reached its nadir on January 25, when Dinesh Kaarthik who played saviour when a score of 100 looked impossible to achieve was relegated to the inside pages, while Ganguly (in Suresh Rainas shirt) grabbed front-page space. Ganguly did not even deserve to be in the news, let alone on Page one. How will The Telegraph ever reach the national stage if it keeps pandering to silly local sentiments?

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Azad Purty,

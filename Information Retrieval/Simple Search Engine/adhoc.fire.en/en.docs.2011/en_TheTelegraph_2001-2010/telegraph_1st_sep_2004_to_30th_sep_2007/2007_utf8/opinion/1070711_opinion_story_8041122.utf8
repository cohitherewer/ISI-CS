 UNSAFE OTHERS

 Like most offensive pieces of writing, the booklet on security tips issued by West Delhi police for students and visitors from the Northeast is bizarrely, inanely funny. That its nasty mix of racism and sexism is motivated by a well-meaning desire to make people, especially women, feel safe and nationally integrated is an indication of how far the police, and national integration, have to go before either can be trusted or taken seriously. But the darker implication of the booklet lies in how certain ways of talking about and dealing with social, cultural and physiognomic difference have become inextricable from notions of security, which, in turn, have become inextricable from ideas of nationhood.

 People from the Northeast eat strange, smelly food and make a lot of noise. The typical young woman from those parts revealing dressed up parties lass (sic) is given to dressing scantily and going on dubious dates. And it is up to these visitors to adapt, integrate and not stand out. Their reward for this would be safety or protection from outrage. Such are the assumptions behind the practical wisdom of this booklet, expressed with a candour, and even quaintness, which most civilized, modern societies used to be capable of about half a century ago. The fact that the booklet is written by an IPS officer a deputy commissioner from the Northeast gives the whole thing a perverse edge. But those who remember the other booklet issued by Delhi police about womens safety on the streets would perhaps be less shocked by this one. It had advised women to scream when attacked, always carry mobile phones (even when going out of their houses to relieve themselves), and when attacked in lonely bus-stops in the evening, to run into the nearest house, but not before checking that the house is properly lit. The rationale behind these publications is that if people women, visitors from the Northeast do not follow the advice given in them, then it is no fault of the police if they come to harm in the capital.

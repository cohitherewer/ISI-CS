 OPEN SKIES

 The new financial year has begun. Now starts the season for the release of last years annual accounts and the reckoning of profit and loss. Other industries may pose uncertainty, but not the airline industry. It needs no genius to predict that most airlines will show losses. When airline operators run into losses, they run to the minister. Mr Praful Patel has been listening to them with some attention; but he has not been able to make up his mind on what he should do for them. Having given them licences, he cannot close down the airlines; and unless some airlines go out of business, there can be no relief from cut-throat competition. Last September, Mr Patel talked of closer scrutiny before giving out new licences; but the closest scrutiny can make little difference if the applicant meets the requirements. Clutching at straws, the civil aviation ministry has now raised minimum equity requirements. But existing airlines will get many months to raise the extra capital; it is only the half-dozen applicants waiting in the wings that will have to go and find some more capital. Given the poor financial prospects of the industry, some of them will find it difficult to raise equity and will withdraw. So this is a step in limiting the stress of competition in the industry.

 But it is a small step, and it will have no long-term effect. If Mr Patel thinks that the industry is overcrowded, he must ask himself why this matters. One reason why it does is that airports are crowded, there is a shortage of parking bays, and planes have to circle in the air for hours to get permission to land. If this is the problem, the government must do one or both of two things. First, it must build, or allow the building of, new airports. The government is excruciatingly slow at such things. But it can release the dozens of runways currently not in use for private development. And there is no reason not to let entrepreneurs build new airports. If the government does not like the idea of airports in private hands, it can insist on putting in a certain minimum equity itself. If it fears that such airports will lead to road congestion, it can specify minimum approach requirements, as well as areas in which they can be located.

 The obvious but important truth the minister must realize is that shortage of flying capacity can only be relieved by its augmentation, not its regulation. He has stopped airlines from levying a congestion surcharge; he has also implicitly ruled out a time-of-day congestion surcharge on airport-landing fees. Both are devices to ration out limited airport capacity, and must be considered in the interim. But Mr Patel is in charge of an industry capable of enormous expansion in pursuit of seemingly unlimited demand. He should decide in favour of growth.

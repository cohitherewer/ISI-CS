 ON A SLOW ROAD

 This above all - Khushwant Singh

 Where time stands still

 I am in a bad mood; and I have good reasons to be in one. I had to spend six hours on National Highway 1. It is ironic that, ten years ago, I made the journey from the outskirts of Delhi to the Shivalik foothills in under four hours. Then NH1 was made a dual highway to make journeys faster. It ended up adding an hour or more to my journey. A few years ago, the authorities decided to expand the dual highway and erect over-bridges across crowded bottlenecks like Panipat. Now, it has become a chaos of honking buses, trucks, tractors, three-wheelers, motor cycles and cars. You crawl for most of the way. 

 I have tried alternative modes of transport. For instance, I have taken the train upto Chandigarh or Kalka, and then travelled by car to Kasauli. That way, I could reach my destination in the afternoon. However, as I aged, I found it difficult to adjust to the Shatabdi timings, getting on and off trains, and walking through crowded platforms. So I went back to travelling by car all the way and thus taking my own sweet time. This time, again, in Nanak Kohlis fancy Mercedes Benz, I left Delhi at 8.15 am, with gulmohars blazing along the route. I reached Karnal by 11 am. The onward journey, particularly after Ambala, was a day-time nightmare. We lost our way thrice because there were no signboards to indicate which road went to Patiala, which led to Chandigarh or Amritsar and which to Kalka and Shimla. I reached Kasauli at 4.30 pm, more dead than alive. I call it disgraceful because all that was needed were large signboards to direct travellers to their destinations. The signboards could have been put up in a day.

 What can we do about such over-crowded roads? As it is, almost the entire route is lined on both sides with shops, dhabas, hotels, farm houses, factories, schools, temples and gurdwaras. However, a few stretches of open farm land still remain. At this time, after the wheat harvest, the only thing that caught my eye were squares of golden-yellow sun flowers that are cultivated for cooking oil. It is a drab countryside. It will grow drabber if we continue to breed like rabbits and the pressure on agricultural land increases relentlessly.

 My mood changed as we entered the Shivaliks at Kalka. Usually, this place is a chronic bottleneck. But, this time, we glided through the congested bazaar on the road to Shimla. The recent rains had washed the hillsides, and every tree and every bush was green. It was blossoming time for the neelams (jacarandas) which were out in all their glory. It is hard to describe them: blue sapphires, lapis lazuli, aquamarines all freshly polished and glistening in the sunlight. They continued to gladden my eyes till I got to my summer abode.

 Not lost in translation

 Omar Khayyam would not have been known to the English-speaking world but for the translations of his Rubaiyyat by Edward Fitzgerald. Many scholars have criticized him for having taken too many liberties with the original, but no one doubts that he did a great job in producing the most readable poetry which is at once profound, profane and poetic. Once read, it stays in your mind for ever.

 S.S. Jogi of Kapurthala has used Fitzgeralds English version to translate some of the rubais into Punjabi. He has also added some of the Persian originals to his compilation. He has done a most commendable job, which must have taken him many years of working on the poetry. Jogi was born in Quetta in 1929; he graduated from the Punjabi University, Chandigarh, and worked as a paramedic till he prematurely retired in 1978. Since then, he has been living in Kapurthala, composing poetry and periodically donating blood to the blood bank. Here are a few of his translations:

 Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath 

 the Bough

 A flask of Wine, a Book of Verse 

 and Thou

 Besides me singing in the

 Wilderness 

 And Wilderness is Paradise

 enow.

 (Rukh dee thandee chhayein

 hovey, kol jo kave pataaree

 Dey kay madh piyaala too

 mainoo chhohein geet piyaaree

 Kisey veeraney vich vee saanoo mil

 jaavey jo rotee

 O veerana jaapey manoo surgaan

 kolon bhaaree)

 There was a door to which I found no

 key:

 There was a Veil past which I could

 not see;

 Some little Talk awhile of Me and

 Thee

 There was and when no more of

 Thee and Me

 (Ik booha jo jatnaan bajhon maithon

 khul na paaya

 Ik parda jis apney ohley sagla

 maram lukaya

 Mayree teyree charcha utthey bas

 kuch pal hee hoee

 Teyr meyr da zikar na usdey magron

 gaya alaya)

 Mother of all problems

 Rahul Gandhi: Mummy, aapki vajah sey meri shadi nai ho rai. (I cannot marry because of you.)

 Sonia Gandhi: Kaisey? (How?)

 Rahul: Har taraf likha hai, Sonia ko bahumat do (Everywhere it is written Do not give bahu to Sonia.)

 Kissa kiss ka:

 Believe it or not, Richard Gere has been heard murmuring:

 Hangama hai kyu itna barpa

 Kiss Hee To Kee hai

 Daka to nahin Daallaa

 Chori to nahin kee hai!

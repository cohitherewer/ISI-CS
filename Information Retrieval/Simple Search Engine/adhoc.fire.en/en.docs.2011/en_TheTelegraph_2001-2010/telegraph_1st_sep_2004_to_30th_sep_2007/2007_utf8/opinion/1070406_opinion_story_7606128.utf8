 Religions that foster hatred

BLACK TONGUE (IndiaInk and Roli, Rs 295) by Anjana Basu captures the world of village politics in which class, caste, religion and superstition combine to create a miasma that offers no escape to those who get embroiled in it. However, city life hardly proves to be better, ruled as it is by the same Communist party that controls life in the villages of West Bengal. As the lives of Maya, the servant girl from rural Bengal, and her Kolkata-based employer, Amrita, become peculiarly intertwined, they start realizing the contradictions fostered in their lives by the Party and that bind them together. The gaps between middle class Kolkata and impoverished rural Bengal close as Maya and Amrita combat the prejudices that an enlightened Party has allowed to flourish.

CHANGING GODS: RETHINKING CONVERSION IN INDIA (Penguin, Rs 350) by Rudolf C. Heredia attempts to show how forced conversions have weakened Indian society by dissociating people from their traditions and belief. The work is unusual, since Heredia is a Jesuit priest arguing for the need of tolerance while remaining firmly rooted to his own faith. With praiseworthy objectivity, he traces the history of conversion in India and the changes that conversion has wrought in the lives of people, especially the tribals and the Dalits. In most cases, he says, conversion fails to alter their devotion to the pagan gods and goddesses but involves them instead in the politics of hate.

 ON EDUCATION: GUIDE TO EDUCATOR (Nirmal, Rs 100) by Sukumar Singh is, says the author in the Preface, for those educationists who believe in the integrated development of the child. Having taught at primary and pre-primary levels in the slums of Calcutta, Singh has first-hand knowledge of the special needs and ailments of young children. So, apart from chapters on the emotional wants of children, there are also essays on Respiratory problems, Common fevers and Other infectious diseases. Essays on the last-mentioned topics might seem unusual in a book on education, but their presence is explained by Singhs genuine concern for the inclusive growth of the child.

 TIGHTEN UP

 With inflation shooting up well beyond the Reserve Bank of Indias upper limit of 5 to 5.5 per cent, the Central bank is expected to raise interest rates further when it meets on January 31 for reviewing monetary policy. But how far will it succeed in reducing inflationary pressures? So far, in spite of several rate hikes and an increase in the amount of deposits that banks have to keep with the Central bank, inflation has continued to mount. That gives some ammunition to those who argue that the current bout of inflation is largely driven by higher prices of food products, a result of inadequate supply, over which the RBI has no control. A look at the data appears to bear out this view most of the rise has occurred in the primary products price index which has risen by 9.28 per cent in the past year. In contrast, the rise in the fuel index has been only 3.63 per cent. However, the price index for manufactured products too has been rising and it has increased 5.91 per cent year-on-year. True, as the finance minister lost no time in pointing out, the lower base for the index at the end of last year contributed to the rise. At the same time, there is increasing evidence that manufacturers are now able to pass on the rise in their input prices to the consumer.

 The other problem that the RBI faces is that, in spite of several rate-hikes, it has not succeeded in slowing the pace of demand growth. The November data on industrial production show that the industrial sector continues to grow at a breakneck pace. Credit growth continues to be above 30 per cent. Real estate prices in the metros show no signs of abating. There are several reasons for the RBIs ineffectiveness. One of them is that while the rise in interest rates on consumer and housing loans may have had a slight dampening of demand, the slack is being taken up by investment demand. Corporates are setting up new capacities across the board. A minor rise in interest rates is unlikely to derail these investment plans, particularly when corporate return on capital employed is much higher than the cost of capital. 

 Companies today also have a number of financing alternatives, such as accessing the stock markets here and abroad, attracting private equity and going in for external commercial borrowings. Money supply growth continues to be in excess of 20 per cent, well above the nominal gross domestic product growth-rate. In the circumstances, the RBI has little alternative but to tighten even further, so that real interest rates go up. It is the prudent thing to do, it will make a difference at the margin and it is unlikely to derail economic growth in todays ebullient economic conditions.

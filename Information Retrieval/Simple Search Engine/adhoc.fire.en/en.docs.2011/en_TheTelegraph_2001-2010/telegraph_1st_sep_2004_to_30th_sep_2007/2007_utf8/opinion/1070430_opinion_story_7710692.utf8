 Letters to Editor

 Derivative lot

 Sir Mukul Kesavans Life at second hand (April 26) delivers a message that needs to be heard throughout India. An extreme defensiveness is noticed among urban, middle-class Indians whenever the authenticity of the new India is questioned. The English-speaking gentry, whether left-liberal, Marxist or neo-liberal, needs to realize that modernity, as it exists today, is essentially a product of the West. The modern (Western) academia, both in the humanities as well as in the sciences, through its innumerable tentacles, engulfs the Indian student within its discourse. Slavishness can be easily detected in the association of cool among the youth with speaking English, and preferring Western, rather than Indian, attire and music. Kesavan shows how even the Hindutva brand of right-wing nationalism is crudely derived from authoritarian European nationalisms.

 However, it is not enough to take Western ideological hegemony as a given and submit to it. Efforts must be made to integrate more Indian thought in academic courses, for starters. Giving Kautilyas political theories the same importance as John Rawls in a political science course could be an example. A large GDP and a nuclear arsenal cannot help in producing a vision for the future.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Leamington Spa, UK

 Sir Talking of the Left in India, Mukul Kesavan says that Indian Marxists mouth lines today which were written for English accents fifty years ago. But more interestingly, the Indian Left movement is perhaps one of the few things in our country which can claim to have both Oriental China and Chairman Mao and Occidental Marx, Lenin et al. influences. In this sense, the Left would not be a good example for Kesavans theory that most elements of Indias modernity are derived from the West. But as far as second-hand, even outdated, ideas are concerned, Kesavan couldnt have asked for a more appropriate example than the Indian leftists. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kripasindhu Goswami, Calcutta

 Lips be sealed

 Sir The arrest warrant against Richard Gere and Shilpa Shetty by a Jaipur court adds a new twist to the pecking controversy (Warrant out over kiss, April 27). The rest of the civilized world must be laughing again at modern India. After the many incidents of effigy-burning and vandalism, it is only appropriate to ask whether such forms of protest uphold Indian norms of civility and decency more than a friendly peck does. One wonders why the petitioners who brought the kiss to the court do not act so urgently on more important matters of public interest.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir It is amazing that there is hardly any collective outrage in India at the way a friendly kiss has been blown out of proportion by a section of the media. Now there is even a lower-court ruling against the culprit, Richard Gere. Are public officials, opinion-makers and journalists afraid to speak out against this farce? The affair is reminiscent of the rule of the taliban. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before Indias ancient sculptures are destroyed a la the Bamiyan Buddhas on the ground that they are an affront to Indian culture and sensibility. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shankar Chaudhuri, New Jersey, US

 Sir After Richard Gere and Shilpa Shetty, Aishwarya Rai and Hrithik Roshan too have been handed summonses for their kissing-scene in the film, Dhoom 2. There should be some law to prevent petitioners from dragging celebrities to court on one trivial pretext or another. If the petitioner objected to the kissing-scene, he should have complained against the censor board, and not the actors in the particular scene.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Why only Aishwarya Rai and Hrithik Roshan? Why werent R. Madhavan and Vidya Balan summoned by the Muzaffarpur court for kissing in Guru? Or Mallika Sherawat and Emraan Hashmi for Murder? The actors only portray characters who happen to kiss. Will they arrest Amitabh Bachchan now for playing a mafia don in Sarkar, or an outlaw in Deewar?

 Yours faithfully,

Sujoy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir A Gandhian or should we say Gandhigiri? answer to the petition filed in a Jaipur court against Shilpa Shetty and Richard Gere would be for the men and women of Jaipur to go to the hearings in large numbers and plant kisses on the cheeks of their spouses and friends.

 Yours faithfully,

Paresh Rajda, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir There is practically a one-sided war going on between the producers of CFL lamps and the manufacturers of bulbs. The CFL lobby argues that the bulb uses up a lot of electricity, and contributes hugely to the phenomenon of global warming. But bulb-producers too, can say that the use of CFL lamps is harmful, since they emit dangerous ultra-violet rays that cause serious harm to the human skin and eyes. It is good to see people waking up to global warming, but why so suddenly? And can bulbs alone cause global warming? They consume a lot of electricity, but they certainly should not be replaced by another evil, that is, CFL lamps. What people can do is sincerely try to use less electricity, and save energy, which would also help them in the long run. It is possible for people to save electricity and save their planet from global warming at the same time. But by opting for CFL lamps instead of bulbs, global warming may be reduced, but there there may no longer be healthy human beings to enjoy its fruits.

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

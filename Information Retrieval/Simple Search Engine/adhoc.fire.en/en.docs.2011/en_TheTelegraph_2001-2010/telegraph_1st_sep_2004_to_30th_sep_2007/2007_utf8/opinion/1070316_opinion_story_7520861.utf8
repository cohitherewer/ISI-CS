 HORROR OF IT

 Shakespeares Moor invoked the cause when he contemplated the murder of his wife, Desdemona. The chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, a student of literature, might well recall those lines when he reflects on the blood that has been shed in Nandigram. He could console himself that the people who died were victims of the cause of industrialization in West Bengal. But that consolation will not answer the question: was the bloodshed necessary? The absolute answer to the question is in the negative since no cause, however noble or worthwhile, can justify the killing of innocent people. That affairs in Nandigram had spun completely out of control had been evident since the first week of January. The government failed then to avoid violence, and on the ides of March, perpetrated greater violence. Precious little was done in these intervening two months to lower tension levels in the area or to assuage the resentment of the local population. In fact, Nandigram remained, for all practical purposes, cut off from the rest of the state and from the states administrative machinery. To meet this situation, it was suddenly decided to send in a police force to re-establish administrative control over the area. It is now clear that no one in the administration had quite calculated the consequences because all were clueless about the nature of the resistance the police would encounter. The chief minister cannot escape the responsibility, moral and political, for this monumental failure and folly. It will be a long time before the smell of blood and gunpowder evaporates from West Bengals body politic.

 This utter failure of the administration and the government is directly related to a pronounced and dangerous tendency in the politics of the state. What prevails in West Bengal are the aims and the interests of the ruling party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The priorities of governance are invariably made subordinate to the political interests of the party. There is no denying that, in Nandigram, the CPI(M) has suffered a political defeat. It has lost control over that turf. It tried to win it back through cadre power in January and it failed. On Wednesday, it tried through police action and failed again. A major consequence of this is the signal of violence that is being emitted from the state to potential investors. Political myopia is blurring Mr Bhattacharjees vision of the future.

 By failing to nip in the bud the resistance in Nandigram, Mr Bhattacharjee has grasped a Tartar. Ms Mamata Banerjee has been gal- vanized into action. There is resentment among the Left Front partners. And above everything else, Mr Bhattacharjee has earned a passionate and unique indictment from the governor, Mr Gopalkrishna Gandhi.

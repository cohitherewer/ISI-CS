 WITH A HEART MADE IN MODENA

 Being the biggest celebrity classical music has ever produced changed Luciano Pavarotti remarkably little, writes Alexander Chancellor

 Normal is bliss

 My most treasured memory of Luciano Pavarotti is of 14 years ago, after a charity concert at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. I had somehow got myself invited to a very grand box, in which the host was Oscar de la Renta and the guests included Nancy Reagan and Henry Kissinger.

 The concert was followed by a dinner in the foyer, at which the benefactors of the opera house and their guests were gathered at separate tables. After a while, the maestro appeared, to great applause, huge and beaming and clutching his handkerchief. He approached our table and swept Nancy Reagan up into his arms and crushed her like a rag doll to his enormous bosom. 

 Depositing her back on her seat, he then did the same to Dr Kissinger, leaving him, too, drained of breath.

 These greetings accomplished, he repaired across the room to a long table at which the humble workers of the opera house were having their supper, stuffed a large napkin into his shirt collar and dug into an enormous plate of spaghetti.

 Pavarotti was by then thanks to the Three Tenors, Nessun dorma, and so on an international megastar, the greatest celebrity that classical music has ever produced; but this had changed him remarkably little.

 He had a flat in New York and was, for tax reasons, officially resident in Monte Carlo, but his heart and his main home was still near Modena, where he was born, and where he would still watch football on television with his childhood friends.

 Even in New York, he tried to live as far as possible as he did at home, having his food cooked simply in a nearby Italian restaurant and brought up to him in his flat. He would even take Modena friends with him on his trips abroad.

 In later years, he tried to focus the worlds attention on his hometown by organizing charity concerts there with pop stars such as Sting and Elton John. In 1995, one of his guests had been Diana, Princess of Wales, with whom he established a warm friendship.

 I next saw Pavarotti in 1997, two days after Dianas death, when I went to interview him at his holiday villa on a hill above Pesaro on the Adriatic. He was sitting at a garden-table overlooking the sea, wearing a Hawaiian flower-patterned shirt, and leaning limply back in his seat in a posture of abject dejection.

 He said what a sweet person the princess had been, how he had cried all day after hearing she had died, and how he would never sing again if he felt as low as he did that day.

 I asked him if he, too, had had problems with the media; and he said, no. Unlike Diana, he was just a normal person.

 I am judged by what I do; I am not a symbol as she was, he said, a symbol of womanhood, a symbol of the monarchy.

 Pavarotti may not have been a symbol of anything, and with his enormous weight, he was certainly not a satisfactory symbol of manhood. But he was also by no means normal, having been blessed, as Placido Domingo has put it, with a god-given voice.

 It might seem humbug in these circumstances for him to portray himself as just one of the chaps, but I dont think it was. 

 He was basically a straightforward man, with no intellectual doubts, who stuck to a simple philosophy of life that he was wont to express in clichs. This was that the world was good, that people were good, and that he was just an ordinary citizen of the world who had always been lucky.

 The main flaw in Pavarottis picture of himself as a man of contentment and benevolence was his abandonment of his first wife, Adua with whom he had three daughters in favour of a woman 30 years younger than himself, Nicoletta Mantovani, whom he later married. 

 He claimed to me that their separation had been by amicable mutual agreement, but Aduas vociferous public outrage and her absence yesterday from his deathbed seemed to cast doubt on this.

 It might also be thought that a man of Pavarottis weight might, out of sensitivity towards animals, hesitate to mount a horse, but riding was his passion and he would not let anything stand in his way. 

 He came to England to select a suitable victim and ended up with a huge, 12-year-old part-bred Irish hunter called Henry, whom I went to see at Pavarottis equestrian centre near Modena, where he held an annual show jumping competition.

 Henry, I must admit, looked fit and contented, despite the fact that he had spent a long, hot summer carrying his great burden on daily rides through the woods around Pesaro. 

 I spoke to Pavarottis English riding instructor, who told me that he often sang to Henry while out riding. Maybe the horse had absorbed the maestros positive message.

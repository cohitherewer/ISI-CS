 Letters to Editor

 High visibility

 Sir It is thoughtful of the government to have banned FTV (Close your eyes, April 2). But it seems to have scarcely realized that obscenity no longer remains restricted to FTV. It is there on every channel, including the news channels. Fashion shows are the staple of all these channels. I wonder why such features are considered indispensable to news coverage. I am also confused about the meaning of womens emancipation. We must uphold each womans freedom to express herself freely. But that does not mean that she is at liberty to misuse such freedom. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Unmaking a hero

 Sir Why should Malvika Singh be surprised at Manmohan Singhs praise for P.V. Narasimha Rao (Uncover the truth, April 3)? Surely, she is aware that some of Singhs traits are similar to Raos. Like Rao, at the crucial hour of the fall of the Babri Masjid, Singh remained a bystander during the pogrom against his kinsmen in 1984, and has remained faithful to the family which did nothing to end the carnage. Singh could have distanced himself from the party, many of whose members played an active role in spreading hatred. Instead, Singh mumbled an apology two decades after the riots, belittling himself even further.

 Malvika Singh hails Manmohan Singh as truly honest and honourable. It is necessary to mention that the prime minister so far has done nothing to remove corruption or stop the criminalization of politics. In fact, he has turned a blind eye to criminals in ministerial berths. India needs to replicate the cleansing operation that Bangladesh is presently undergoing. The flourishing politician-police-criminal nexus must be ruthlessly eliminated.

 Yours faithfully,

 J. Kumar Dutta, Calcutta

 Sir Malvika Singhs anger against P.V. Narasimha Rao and her adulation for Manmohan Singh seems inexplicable. Rao was able to exercise his authority in a way that Singh will never be able to. Rao, in fact, ruled with rare acumen. Save for the Babri Masjid demolition, his tenure was remarkable. Notwithstanding Malvika Singhs misgivings about Raos economic policy, it needs to be said that it is doubtful if a Nehru-Gandhi would have had the courage to initiate liberalization at a time Rao did, no matter how desperate the situation. The very fact that Rao did not belong to the family, perhaps gave him the freedom to act on the sage advice of his finance minister. It is not unnatural for the former finance minister to have a sense of gratitude towards the man who gave him his ear and changed the course of the countrys history.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Srivastava, Calcutta

 Little attention

 Sir The All India Chess Federation needs to be congratulated for fighting it out with FIDE over the world rankings (Anand is No.1 after drama, April 2). Viswanathan Anand has performed consistently well ever since winning the world championship about a decade back. It is a pity that he does not get endorsements commensurate with his achievements in a truly international sport. After the debacle in cricket, one hopes that corporate houses in India will give other sports the same impetus.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir The medias step-motherly attitude towards chess is obvious. The achievement of Viswanathan Anand has not got the attention it deserved. Let us not kill this sport with the attitude that sounded the death knell for hockey and soccer in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada

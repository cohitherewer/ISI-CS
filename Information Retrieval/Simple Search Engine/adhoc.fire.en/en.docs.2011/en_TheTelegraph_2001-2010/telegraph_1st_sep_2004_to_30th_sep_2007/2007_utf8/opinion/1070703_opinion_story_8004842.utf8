The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THAT TIME 

 OF THE YEAR 

 MALAFIDE

 Malvika Singh

 I 

 remember growing up in Bombay. I remember the monsoon particularly, 

 and with much nostalgia, for it was the best and most delightful 

 part of the year. There was no semblance of the kind of 

 flooding we see today, just non-stop rain with which a cool 

 would descend and relieve us of the sticky humidity before 

 the onset of this wonderful season. In those days, the city 

 was managed well. You could walk on the pavements. They 

 were not strewn with garbage. Its public transport system 

 was amongst the best in India and even as children aged 

 eleven, we used BEST buses from the Malabar hills to get 

 to our drama and other extra-curricular classes miles away, 

 unescorted. But today this metropolis has shamed us. It 

 is tied up in knots and locked in an untenable reality. 

 Over the years, Bombay has fragmented 

 and crumbled into Mumbai, heralding chaos and anarchy. Every 

 year as the rains break, images of men cleaning clogged 

 gutters are splashed across the newspapers. An inept municipality 

 gets worse with every passing month. It appears to be accountable 

 to no superior authority, since no rectification of its 

 ways is evident. The dilution of the energy and vitality 

 of the city is overwhelming. The break down is all-pervasive. 

 Mumbai today symbolizes an administrative and political 

 failure. It epitomizes the worst outcome of the nexus between 

 the authorities, business and the mafia. 

 No excuses

 Yet it was a city of style, of 

 grace, a melting pot of ideas and innovation. It was a haven 

 for the liberals, one that attracted diverse disciplines 

 and expertise from across the world. Today, Mumbai has degenerated 

 into a rich urban slum. Life is a struggle. Endless hours 

 are wasted on potholed roads, trying to get from one point 

 to another, and energy is sapped by the inconsequential. 

 It is nothing short of a scandal 

 that this city drowns every year during the months of rain. 

 The monsoon, as it is in Mumbai, is a normal phenomenon 

 on all coasts. Unfortunately, governments in Maharashtra 

 have, over the years, mismanaged, allowed environmental 

 norms to be broken with their tacit approval, condoned malfunctioning 

 municipalities and have destroyed this once-upon-a-time 

 city of dreams. 

 There is no excuse for this degradation. 

 The government needs to act on a war footing and take Mumbai 

 back to where it once was. It needs to come up with ideas 

 on how to deal with a growing population and all the problems 

 that accompany that growth. 

 Another deluge

 Stringent environmental norms 

 need to be put in place. Building laws need to be enforced. 

 No multi-storeyed building should get a clearance without 

 making provision for car parks for their residents, or without 

 permanent rooms being earmarked for the use of their staff. 

 Frankly, it should be mandatory to have a strip of green 

 around the building with as many trees planted as there 

 are residents. Enforce the laws and people will find alternatives 

 within that law. 

 A revival needs to be initiated 

 and nurtured to fruition. Standards need to be set by those 

 who people the city as idols, stars and celebrities. 

 Intellectual energy, an austerity of style, an end to flashiness 

 and the all pervading sound-bite-culture, and lots more 

 need to kick in and trigger vivacity and zest. 

 A crisp and invigorating spirit 

 that is culturally rooted, youthful, cultivated and unpolluted 

 by all that is superficial must be allowed to invade Mumbai 

 and flood its body and soul. Who will lead the troops? Who 

 will break the stronghold of a failed but still operating 

 nexus that has destroyed Bombay and Mumbai?

 WITHOUT MUCH CARE

 Sumanta Sen

 The government in Bangladesh is supposed to be a caretaker one, but it has clearly gone beyond its brief. It has subverted the nations constitution, according to which its specific task was to supervise the election of a new government. Instead, the Fakhruddin Ahmed administration in Dhaka seems bent on crushing the countrys political establishment and decimating the two leading figures, Sheikh Hasina Wajed and Begum Khaleda Zia. This is subversion of the democratic process, something not new to Bangladesh.

 Political arrests have become the order of the day. Given the trend, it may well be a matter of time before the two women are sent to jail. In any case, both are virtual prisoners in Dhaka. The caretaker government recently stopped an international carrier from flying in with the Awami League leader from Germany. It then allowed her to return, only to stop her again from leaving the country (she was to visit her ailing daughter). The treatment meted out to Khaleda Zia has been no better.

 All this is being done in the name of weeding out corruption. Only the gullible will accept that argument. The charges of corruption against many may be true, but the deliberate attacks on political leaders make it clear that the administrations intentions are not noble. With the army as a willing partner, it does seem that Fakhruddin Ahmed and his colleagues are seeking to do a Musharraf in Bangladesh. Just as the General has succeeded in keeping Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto out of Pakistan, Ahmed seems intent on keeping both leaders at bay. Yet, both had enjoyed the peoples mandate, and one of them will certainly do so again if elections are held. That makes them dangerous to the politically-ambitious army.

 Helping hand

 But why arent the people rising up in protest against the administration? The only answer seems to be the absence of leadership. Both Wajed and Zia have proved incapable of providing the kind of leadership that is required at this juncture. The two could have joined hands to fight the government, but the deep-rooted mistrust between them cannot be easily overcome. In India, the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) came together to fight a common enemy. But it is perhaps too much to expect a 36-year-old nation to display the maturity of a 60-year old country. 

 For the Awami League, what must be even more frustrating is the lack of sympathy and help it had expected from New Delhi. India, of course, cannot but see things from its own perspective. For reasons best known to it, it thinks the dispensation in Bangladesh will stick to its promise of being a good neighbour. 

 No sign of change

 That hope has now been belied. There is no indication that Dhaka will stop sheltering subversive elements from this side of the border. Intelligence reports show that these elements in Bangladesh are receiving more funds from the Inter-Services Intelligence and the Organization of Islamic Countries. Dhaka also shows no signs of a change in policy. The Myanmar-Bangladesh-India gas pipeline is still to be cleared. New Delhi has decided to toughen its stand, but will Dhaka really respond?

 Inside Bangladesh, of course, the battle has to be fought by the democratic will of the people. They have fought many such battles in the past, even before 1971. It is also possible that the ousted leaders will find a way out to meet the challenge squarely. The Dhaka administration will spare no effort to build up its own support base among the urban elite, always a vulnerable section of society. But even this class must ask itself a question can a democracy, as Bangladesh calls itself, continue with a government that does not enjoy popular sanction?

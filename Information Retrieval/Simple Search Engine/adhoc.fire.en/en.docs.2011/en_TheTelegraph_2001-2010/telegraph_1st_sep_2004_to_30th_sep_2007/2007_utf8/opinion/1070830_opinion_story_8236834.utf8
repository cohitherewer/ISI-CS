 Letters to Editor

 Bad man, Salman

 Sir The district and sessions court of Jodhpur has done the right thing by sentencing Salman Khan to rigorous imprisonment for five years for poaching a blackbuck near Ghoda in 1998 (Catch Salman if you can, Aug 25). Govinda, his fellow actor and friend, claimed that Khan is being unfairly targeted for being a celebrity. Unfortunately, Govindas argument is flawed. If one were to accept his point of view, then every celebrity in India would be able to get away with their crimes. There is ample evidence of Khans insensitive nature. He not only killed an endangered animal, but, on another occasion, ran his car over sleeping pavement-dwellers in Mumbai. There is no need to shed tears for Khans arrest since it is only celebrities themselves who think that they are above the law. It is fortunate that the Indian judiciary and people like Mahipal Bishnoi are still around. Without their vigilant jurisprudence, it is doubtful whether the rich and the famous would ever get punished in India. The judgment on Salman Khan is absolutely fair and his predicament should be a lesson to all celebrities. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir While the court has wisely upheld the five-year sentence on Salman Khan, Shibu Soren has been released for lack of evidence. Behind the apparent incompetence of the prosecution, there is reason to believe that the Indian judicial system is fundamentally flawed. The judiciary banks on unreliable testimonies of witnesses who are not very dependable characters themselves. After that, all the evidence is left to the presiding judges to interpret. It is needless to point out the high degree of subjectivity involved in such a judicial process. The subjectivity and, accordingly, the level of bias and the chances of making a mistake vary from judge to judge and from court to court. Thus, in Sorens case, the Delhi high court overruled the earlier judgment even though the evidence remained the same. In Khans case, the lower courts decision will now be challenged in the high court. Ultimately, both Soren and Khan have been accused of serious transgressions. If they are guilty, they should not be allowed to get away with their crimes.

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir Supreme Court judges have observed that the acquittal of an offender on flimsy grounds has often shaken public faith in the judiciary. Unfortunately, in many cases involving high-profile defendants, the prosecution fails to prove the charges. It has not been easy to bring Salman Khan to book and Shibu Soren, after months in prison, has now been acquitted by the Delhi high court. There are innumerable instances in every Indian court of the murder-accused being set free for lack of evidence. Often, such acquittals result in hardened criminals returning to society. Every time such an acquittal takes place, it is civil society and the victims that are punished once more.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

 Sir There is nothing unusual about Sanjay Dutt or Salman Khan being punished for their crimes (Salman submits to dads script, Aug 26). They may be celebrities, but they are certainly not above the law. In fact, the media have a big responsibility in directing public attention to important and relevant issues. The print and broadcast media must play a role in shaping public opinion on such matters. It is therefore disheartening to see the Indian media devote undue time and space to criminals and celebrities merely because they make for sensational news. Such coverage no longer focuses on their crimes but are dedicated to the celebrities themselves. The fact is that both Dutt and Khan are guilty and they have been duly punished. In fact, they should consider themselves lucky to have enjoyed rather long reprieves because of the Indian mindset to ignore the crimes committed by the rich and the powerful. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The photographs on the first page of The Telegraph on August 26 reflected the national mood. The handsome law-abiding citizen, Salman Khan, hugs his father the reader may be sure of being told about the actors big heart in the coming days, just the way it happened when Sanjay Dutt had to go to jail. And in the collective swooning over such large-hearted men, the dead boy lying between the rows of chairs (in the photograph of the Hyderabad blast) will soon be buried and forgotten. After all, how many of us remember those injured or killed outside a bakery in Bandra five years ago? Although The Telegraph School Awards event managed to get some space, even that bit of good work got squeezed to death between saleable news and advertisements. The awarded rickshaw-puller, Swapan Adhikary, got pushed to Page 7 when he ought to have appeared on Page 1. Perhaps the newspaper, like the rest of us, should admit with Adhikary that there is not much for our hard labour in the first page. The only consolation is that the backstage is peopled by those who really deliver the goods. In this age of crass materialism, the unattractive face of the rickshaw-puller could not have competed with Salman Khan for space on the front-page. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir Salman Khan is finally in jail and, one hopes, will stay there for a full five years. But given the propensity of the Indian judicial system to let celebrity criminals out of prison and return them to the bosom of their families at a small price, there is every reason to be afraid of Khan getting back home before dark. Meanwhile, there should be restrictions on his celebrity visitors. Such visits not only antagonize the jails inmates but are also in bad taste. Salman Khan should not be allowed to be a star in jail.

 Yours faithfully,

R.K. Sengupta, Calcutta

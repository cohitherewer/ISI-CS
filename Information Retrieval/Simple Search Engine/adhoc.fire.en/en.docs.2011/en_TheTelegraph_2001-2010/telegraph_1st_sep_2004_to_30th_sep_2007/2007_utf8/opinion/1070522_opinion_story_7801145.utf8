 Guns and godmen

 Much ado about godly affairs

 Sir The people of Punjab must avoid further violence on the Dera Sacha Sauda controversy (Sikhs flare up at Guru in ad, May 16). They need to identify and foil political gameplans designed to trap them yet again. They should recall how a similar problem with the Nirankaris in the late Seventies had turned a prosperous Punjab upside-down, causing an unprecedented bloodbath. Both the Dera followers and Sikhs opposed to the sect should realize that no one can become Guru Gobind Singh merely by draping himself in similar garb and imitating the tenth Sikh Gurus initiation rites. The only practical course of action at the moment is to ignore the issue altogether and let it die a natural death. Besides, the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee should provide education for the poor and thus make people aware of what true Sikhism stands for.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Raghubir Singh, 

 Pune

 Sir The report, Sex, murder and snazzy cars: tale of a god (May 19), was shocking. If Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is indeed guilty of murder and the sexual exploitation of female devotees, he should have been tried and jailed a long time ago. It seems that the Dera head has been spared for so long because of the sects close ties with the Congress. Therefore, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government must instruct the Central Bureau of Investigation to speed up its probe. A fast-track investigation would allow quick action by the government. It could also be a means of precluding future confrontations of the kind that Punjab is witnessing at present. 

 The situation in the state is critical. The violence must be brought to an end immediately and then steps taken to resolve the crisis between the Dera sect and the rest of the Sikh community. The Union home ministry did not act in time to prevent the escalation of the violence. The state and the Centre must deploy adequate military and paramilitary forces in north India. However, just dispatching armed battalions will not diffuse the tension and bring peace. All national and regional parties in the North must take the initiative to end the mindless violence. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Is the honour and dignity of Guru Gobind Singh so fragile that they can be shattered by someone dressing or behaving like him? By holding a huge congregation of top Sikh religious leaders and thousands of followers, the Sikhs have given undue importance to Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh of the Dera Sacha Sauda sect. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh has expressed his regret at the controversy and professed his high regard for Gobind Singh. Therefore, following Sikh tradition, it is perhaps best for the Akal Takht to forgive him. Agreed, Gurmeet Singh has made a fool of himself. The Damdami Taksal chief, Harnam Singh, has rightly said that Gurmeet Singh has caused the offence and not his followers. Although the Akal Takht has asked for the closure of the Deras branches by May 27, the tension on the ground should be kept in mind and further confrontation avoided.

 Whatever action is taken against Gurmeet Singh, it ought to be taken by the government rather than by a group of religious leaders. The right to freedom of speech in a democracy is all very well, but when it hurts religious sentiments, the law should punish the offender. Such punishment, however, needs to emanate from the courts and not from the streets. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Govind Das Dujari,

 Sir The turn of events in Punjab is unfortunate. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and the Dera Sacha Sauda should have pondered the consequences of their advertisement. If the sect did not intend offence, why did it depict its chief as Guru Gobind Singh? Since the majority of the Dera followers are Sikhs, they should have anticipated the charges of blasphemy against them. It is indeed a little difficult to believe that the Dera is innocent in this case. 

 Nevertheless, with the crisis worsening by the day, the Akal Takhts call for the closure of the Deras branches will jeopardize the attempts at restoring law and order. A forced closure, even if it is executed by the military or the paramilitary forces, will only lead to further violence. Gurmeet Singh is already accused of other wrongdoings. It will, therefore, be more appropriate to allow the CBI to investigate his alleged crimes and let the law take its course. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Niladri R. Dey,

 Sir Punjab cannot afford another descent into hell. It has just emerged from one. The Dera Sacha Sauda is certainly guilty of a serious social offence. Besides, it has endangered the lives of millions of residents of northern India. It was altogether unnecessary to compromise the peace and security of an entire region for a publicity campaign. On the other hand, the Akal Takht should have restrained its hardliners. If their followers take to the streets against the Dera sect, there will be more bloodshed and mayhem in Punjab and its neighbouring states. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot 

 Sir While many have been all praise for Mayavati and others have expressed astonishment at her remarkable victory, there has been little attention drawn to the parallel between Mayavatis success and that of another lady, Indira Gandhi, when she had demolished all the old warhorses of an undivided Congress and created Congress (I). To oust the old factions of the undivided Congress, Indira Gandhi took the help of the left parties, with which, particularly the undivided Communist Party, she had fought a bitter battle from 1957. 

 Mayavati, in search of power, made a compromise with the upper castes of Uttar Pradesh, who, till the other day, were anathema to her party. Although it is too early to say how the UP drama will unfold, it should be remembered that Indira Gandhi abandoned the Left as soon as she thought fit. Mayavati, no doubt, will do the same with the Brahmins. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 H.P. Mitra,

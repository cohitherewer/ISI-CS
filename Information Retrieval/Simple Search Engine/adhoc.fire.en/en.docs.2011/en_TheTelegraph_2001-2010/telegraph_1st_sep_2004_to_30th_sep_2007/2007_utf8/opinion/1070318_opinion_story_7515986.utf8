 Letters to Editor

 Top of the world

 Sir As the country becomes crazed by the World Cup fever, another sporting glory has taken place quietly. Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand has made the country proud by reaching the top of the the new world rankings. He was the first Asian to win the World Championships in Tehran in 2000, as also the first player to have won each of the three major tournaments: Corus, Linares and Dortmund. With his latest victory, Anand has yet again become an icon for aspiring players all around the nation. 

 Yours faithfully,

 B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Flop show 

 Sir It seems logical that the marriage of Elizabeth Hurley and her millionaire husband, Arun Nayar, has elicited the ire of the purists (Lizs 7 rounds draw a blank, March 12). What went on in Jodhpur was only a re-enactment of a marriage that had already been solemnized in Britain according to Christian traditions. The celebrity couple should have been mindful of the sentiments of millions of Hindus when they reportedly completed only four out of the seven rounds around the sacred fire. The Indian government should impose a special entertainment tax on celebrity marriages, such as these. That way people will think twice before making a mockery of marriage rituals. 

 Finally, it seems that Nayar and Hurley chose India primarily because the pomp and grandeur around their marriage would be inflated many times against the backdrop of poverty here. Having a Hindu marriage was of no importance to them.

 Yours faithfully,

 Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, New Delhi

 Sir The moment Elizabeth Hurley and Arun Nayar decided to have an Indian wedding, the self-righteous custodians of Indian culture began their rants. It is not for us to judge what they should or should not have done. Their interest in an Indian wedding only shows their respect for our culture. Anybody has the right to marry in any place so long as one of them is a citizen of that country. Nobody criticized the Christian wedding just because Nayar is not a Christian. Why cant we stop intruding into peoples private lives and dictating the way they should conduct themselves?

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Sir The way journalists scrounged for whatever they could grab of the Hurley-Nayar marriage in Jodhpur was deplorable . It seemed they had little to fear from the elaborate security ring around the celebrity couple. It was only a few months back that mediapersons were given a good thrashing by the security protecting Anjelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and yet no lessons seem to have been learnt from that experience.

 Yours faithfully,

 Santanu Basu,Chanchal, Malda

 Parting shot

 Sir After the gruesome tragedy in Nithari, the work done by the National Study on Child Abuse in exposing the ugly face of child rights in India is immensely valuable. The editorial, Social crime (March 13), while recommending the survey, has rightly pointed out the need for stronger laws to protect children from becoming victims of various injustices. However, one cant help wondering who is to take the initiative for this. Putting the blame on the state for its failure to perform its duties is just an easy way out. We have to contribute in some form individually. We should at least stop employing little children as domestic help. If we are not sensitive to these issues in our everyday life, we cannot expect the state to singlehandedly usher in such a momentous social change.

 Yours faithfully,

 Akasmika Rath, Bhubaneswar

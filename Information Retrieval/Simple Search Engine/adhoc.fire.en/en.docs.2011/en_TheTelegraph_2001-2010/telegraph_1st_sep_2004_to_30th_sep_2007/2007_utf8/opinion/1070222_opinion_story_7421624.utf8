 SPIRIT OF THE NEW YEAR

 Neha Sahay

 Come Chinese New Year, and its time for the two most powerful men in China to spend time with the countrys most powerless citizens. So President Hu Jintao spent New Years eve with awestruck farmers in the north-western Gansu province, and Premier Wen Jiabao had a hectic time touring the north-eastern Liaoning province to meet a cross-section of people.

 Call it tokenism, but the broad, typically peasant smiles that looked out of the front pages of the China Daily, as a farmer handed over a basketful of potatoes to the president, were not fake. Nor the soulful expressions on the university students singing full-throatedly along with the premier.

 It is not only simple rustics and nave students. Even the most discerning of Chinese, who feel deeply upset at the vast inequalities in China today, are loath to blame the central leadership. So it is not surprising that many ordinary Chinese feel proud about these annual visits. Catch any head of the so-called great democracies of the West doing the same, they say. 

 So President Hu actually fried flour crispies along with a village family, and commented on the progress of the village since he last visited it eight years back. Wen spent the morning seated on the kang, a brick bed that can be heated, in the small home of a farmer in a remote village somewhere near Mongolia. For good measure, he announced, To be quite frank with you, I feel better when sitting on the kang than in the office. The afterglow of this would probably warm the familys deprived existence for weeks.

 People-friendly

 In the afternoon, he headed for the provincial capital, an industrial-military base, one of Chinas dustiest, most polluted cities. Talking to doctors at its biggest hospital, he reportedly moved them to tears by praising their dedication. After a visit to the city supermarket, he descended into its entrails: meeting construction workers inside a subway, stressing not only his governments commitment to migrant workers, but also his personal contribution to them. In 2003, on one such New Year visit, he had helped get them their back wages, and another year, he invited their kids for a New Year party to the New Forbidden City (the popular name for the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing).

 The importance of this annual ritual can be gauged by the choice of places visited. Gansu province is both one of Chinas most arid, ruined by repeated droughts, as well as one of its most mineral-rich ones, home to many mines synonymous with deaths of miners in accidents, often a result of collusion between owners and local party officials. The mountain village where the president chose to spend time is accessible only by a bumpy road, and has been the target of anti-poverty programmes.

 Both Gansu and Liaoning provinces have seen dogged protests against pollution and corruption. The city visited by Wen was the site of a long sit-in last year by barefoot teachers, once the backbone of the rural education system. Most of them had taught in remote villages for decades, but had been laid off and replaced by professionals, some of whom had apparently bought their qualifying certificates.

 Again, it was for good reason that the premier chose to spend time with migrant workers again people who had not been able to go back to their villages for New Year. Over the last two years, migrant workers have fought bitterly for unpaid wages all over the country. Such has been the impact of these mass incidents that for the first time, this year, a private company in Shenzhen hosted a million yuan banquet for its 2,000 migrant workers, where they rubbed shoulders with local party bosses. Shenzhen is notorious for its sweatshops, where migrants produce the worlds leading brands.

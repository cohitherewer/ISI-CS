 THE STENCH REMAINS

 Malvika singh

 When the Supreme Court of India rules against vendors cooking and selling food at roadside eateries and arbitrarily bans that economic activity from happening, one wonders why they are not as proactive in banning all Indian men from unbuttoning or unzipping their flies in public to pee merrily at street corners, against walls, buildings and on any private and public property they can find, leaving behind the most horrible stench, one that pervades the length and breadth of this country. 

 Why does the exalted bench not ban the rampant destruction of our habitat and environment, starting with simple things like prohibiting the spitting of paan juice all over the streets and often on walls, as well as banning scratching the surfaces of conserved monuments with the names of their loved ones? Why does the court not force municipalities, by a legal mandate, to cover all the open drains that breed disease, and be accountable as government departments? Why does the court not compel the regular, daily collection of garbage and its correct disposal? Why can it not make sure the police enforce road rules to prevent innocents from being killed by callous drivers? Why does the Supreme Court not ensure that the government abides by the laws of the land? The time has come to ban all the little horrors that impact the lives of every citizen, rich and poor.

 Roadside eating does not violate any civilized norm. It is in our tradition and it caters to a need. What it needs is a stringent law that determines and demands an adherence to some basic norms of hygiene, cleanliness and disposal of waste. To ensure all of that requires creative ideating and rigid enforcement. Is that too difficult a task? Why kill the soul of a city when you can kindle it? At this present pace of judicial intervention in all manner of social activity, we may well cease to be a democratic entity as conceived by those who framed our Constitution. We may have to swear in the chief justice as the chief administrator of the nation! 

 Wrong track

 It would not surprise anyone today if the Supreme Court were to rule and enforce a particular dress code for all Indians. To overturn that ruling we would require a two-thirds majority in parliament. In recent times, we have not seen a clear and definite political consensus on any national issue of import. Parliamentarians come together, cross over parties, only on populist and vote-catching issues that help keep them in the House. This lack of commitment and dilution of the role of an elected representative could lead to societal chaos and confusion. Therefore, the government must cleanse its operation, devise modern mechanisms that enforce the laws of this land honestly and with integrity, and govern with non-partisan, managerial skills. Only then will the judiciary be able to play its legitimate and most useful role, that of being the arbiter of what is right and what is blatantly wrong in the eyes of the law. If the judiciary is forced to play the role of the executive, it too will run the risk of getting corrupted, much like most of our public institutions. 

 This escalating and rather frightening conflict between the judiciary and the executive is only one of the many issues where a national debate is called for. And what better year to renew our pledge with destiny than the sixtieth anniversary of our independence? Celebrations are being planned but no assessments of the past failures or positive, creative formulas for the future seem to be on the anvil. This desperate desire to put aside, ignore and forget the destructive truths staring us in the face is unacceptable. It aggravates what could well be steered towards the right track and gradually rectified. The short-sightedness of our leadership and the administrators, is what has put India on the list of backward nations despite its much touted rate of growth.

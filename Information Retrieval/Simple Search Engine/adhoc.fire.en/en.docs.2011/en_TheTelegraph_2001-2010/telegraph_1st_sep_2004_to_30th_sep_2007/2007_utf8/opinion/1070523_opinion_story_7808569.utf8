 SITTING ON THE MAGIC SEAT

 - Communal incitement can be defeated by a democratic movement

 Barun De

The Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad is ignored by those who look upon the Charminar as the citys logo. Reporting the bomb blast there, one English-language paper headlines it as an Andhra Pradesh mosque, while a Bengali daily captions the Charminar Mecca Masjid. However, it represents more aspects of the ancien rgime than the Charminar, which is a parvenu, built in the 19th century. The masjid, supposedly built with earth brought from Mecca Sharif in Arabia, the home of the Prophet, was initiated by Qutb Shah of Golconda, famous for his piety as well as for maintaining the composite Hindu-Muslim culture, and completed by Aurangzeb, who suppressed Golconda regionalism. When later Mughal power in the Deccan collapsed, its Turani viceroys from Bukhara, who took the title Nizam-ul-Mulk, all of them till the last Nizam, Osman Ali Khan noted for his miserliness, wealth and reluctance to join the Indian Union were buried in pavilions along the left-hand side of the masjid courtyard. It is consecrated in the city, and is what Westminster Abbey is to the British or the Panthon and Saint-Denis are to the Parisian.

 Those who think of the blast during the last Jumma namaz as just another terrorist attack near the Charminar seriously underestimate its significance. Some explosive devices did not work. If they had, the carnage would have been greater than in Mumbai, London, or Madrid. Despite initial local mob violence in the slums around these cultural monuments, there has not been serious communal rioting. The good sense recently shown in Varanasi appears to be communicating itself in attempts to retain our tradition of peace and harmony despite provocation. These are not the only points, though they may be the simplest that come to mind. The issues have to be looked at both in the context of political economy and cultural policy.

 The Mecca Masjid has always been a rallying point for urban fanaticism. In early June 1857, posters were stuck up on its walls, saying, The oath of the Almighty is on him who does not read this paper. It called on the then nizams minister not to fear or be apprehensive....If fearful he should wear bangles and sit at home. The Meerut rebels had taken Delhi and the placard appealed to Muslims and Hindus to unite and force the ruler to join the rebellion. Dire indignity was threatened against those who delayed in killing the Christian Englishmen. They were asked to gather on a Friday and launch an agitation from the masjid. To those who would like to celebrate 1857 and not remember it in all its historical contradictions, it may be added that when a local mullah called Maulvi Akbar incited the mob to hoist the rebel flag on the mosque ramparts, it was dispersed by a strong guard of Arabs from the Hadhramaut in southern Arabia the traditional mercenaries of the nizam, whose successors in 1947 would have liked to join Pakistan. In 1857, it was the mob that was anti-colonialist. The Arab mercenaries, however, suppressed through June and July the prospect of driving the Englishmen out of inland Deccan.

 The Mecca Masjid represents some contradiction of composite culture. The inner city crowds have not improved their sanitation, urban misery, or quality of life in the way that has happened since the Sixties south of the Musi River and the Jubilee and Banjara Hills. They represent an underclass of marginalized and semi-proletarianized labourers, vendors, artisans and shopkeepers of textiles, silverware and bangles. Even their bastion of pride, the Nizamat of the Asaf Jahis, has been forgotten. One of the citys better historians did not even know about the nizams tombs being located in the masjid. All that the media are interested in is how many foreign wives and children are contesting for shares in the old rulers fortunes and restored palaces. Yet, it is this same inner-city crowd which, till 15 years ago, was slogging it out in vicious urban riots, Hindu merchants on one side and Muslim vendors, labourers and decaying landlords on the other, seeking prestige and vengeance in fights run by mafia bosses such as the local authority of the Owaisi family. It is to the Telugu Desam Partys credit since N.T. Rama Raos time that it firmly dealt with local communalism in old Hyderabad, and that such riots in the city had stopped. One fears these might once again be provoked.

 Globalization of communal violence was initiated in the Eighties by American backing of mujahideen in Afghanistan, such as the local Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and the foreigner Osama bin Laden. This spiralled into the confrontation of al Qaidas followers with American might. It was taken to a higher plane of brutal neo-colonialism by George W. Bushs interventions in Iraq. 

 This had its fallout, not just all over the south Asian subcontinent in different ways, but also in the inner-city economy and politics of oldest Hyderabad. In 1947, Syed Kasim Razvi and his Razakars were the tip of a spear of which the Majlis-i-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen were the force. Once again the Majliss name is being heard in local cultural politics. The cause of secularism, championed in 1947-1950 by communist ideologues of all faiths is being taken by some socially dedicated Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers into the galis around Lad Bazar, where multi-coloured tinsel churis are sold, or Chow Mahalla, whose Nizam Palace is being restored by Intach. Urban stagnation, surrounded by wealth and burgeoning growth, in which some rich people are getting richer, but the poor are getting poorer, creates grounds for provocation if it is focussed on sites of old cultural pride. This captures the media and spreads ripples of the new communal discontent that has surfaced with the contemporary turn-of-the-century revivalism, be it Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Christian.

 Common citizens do not know the way out of these tangles. It does not seem that the top politicians do any more either. Not just locally disgruntled elements, cross-border instigators might also sneak in and ignite explosive devices. In Sind, the Pakistani establishment has always blamed the Indian instigation of Sindhis and Baluchis for Karachis endemic violence. In Bangladesh, even fighters for the secular cause speak of cross-border armament dealers of the United Liberation Front of Asom from Assam, from Myanmar, and from the West, who ignite both the religious fanaticism of the Wahabis and the Hizb-ut-Tahrir, as well as the hooligan violence against secularists in the mofussil and in Dhaka. This blurring of territoriality is inevitable in globalization. The point is how to check it.

 One way for trustees of cultural properties, such as national museums or religious complexes, is to surround and permeate them by armed guards who can intimidate terrorist aspirants and can sniff out troublemakers as if they were human guard dogs. It is common to talk of battalions of Central Industrial Security Force personnel with arsenals of guns and fleets of vehicles being paid out of taxpayers money to guard each such cultural property. This can only lead to the militarization of cultural memory. In the long run that will weaken our democratic sense.

 On the contrary, we should support any effort for a proactive, democratic movement against communal incitement. At any rate, when I go back to Hyderabad as I have been doing since 1964, I shall certainly do what I first did then, go to the stone bench on the right hand side of the Mecca Masjid court, near the place where those who pray, clean themselves, and where the bombs went off, and I shall sit on the stone seat which is said to have a magical property those who sit on it must come back to old Hyderabad again.

 UP RIDDLE

 Ever since psephology call it science or call it statistical jugglery became fashionable in India, certain phrases have gained currency. One of these is the anti-incumbency factor. Whenever a government is unseated, election watchers unfailingly bring out this phrase as a catch-all explanation for electoral reverses. It was trotted out as soon as Mulayam Singh Yadav and the Samajwadi Party lost the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. For the anti-incumbency argument to hold its own, one piece of statistics is absolutely critical. The election results must show that not just the number of seats but even the vote share of the SP have fallen from the previous results. The results this time, alas, do not provide this. The returns show that the SPs current vote share of 25.45 per cent is, in fact, a slight improvement on its performance in 2002. An improvement, however marginal, cannot be used to fortify the anti-incumbency argument. On the contrary, the figures suggest that the SP retained its core support among the other backward classes. Its tenure in office did not affect its popular base one way or the other. Analysts will thus have to look elsewhere.

 The biggest loser in these elections has been the Bharatiya Janata Party, both in terms of seats and vote share. Its seats are down to 51 and its share of the popular vote has fallen by three per cent to 18.5. This is in sharp contrast to the performance of the principal also-ran in the UP electoral race. In terms of vote share, the Congress has maintained its status quo. The BJPs debacle is probably due as much to its own lack of discipline and unity as to its covert flirtation with Mr Yadav. What is more important is that it may have been perceived as a party that is too Delhi-centric and therefore incapable and unwilling to articulate the interests of UP and its people.

 Both the winner, the Bahujan Samaj Party, and the main loser, the SP, are identified and seen as essentially UP political formations. The former increased its vote share and the latter maintained it. This should suggest something about the preferences of the UP electorate. They clearly chose to vote for parties that represent their state and their interests. Parties that were perceived as having been tinged by Delhis tar faced the voters indifference, if not hostility. In the context of this hypothesis, Mr Yadav may have paid for his closeness to Delhi and its politics. Mayavatis supporters did not see her as being contaminated by Delhi. The results of the UP assembly elections can be read as an anti-Delhi vote. There was one other obvious factor at play. The Dalits, thanks to the work of the Election Commission, came out in larger numbers to vote, leading to BSPs triumph.

 Catherine The Great: Love, Sex and Power

 By Virginia Rounding, 

 Arrow, pound; 4.75

 Catherine the Great was larger than life. She was born Sophie Frederica Auguste of Annhalt-Zerbst on May 2, 1729 in Pomerania. Her parents were minor royalty in what is today Germany. There were so many such royal families that Germany in the 18th century was described as a feudal anthill.

 In February 1744, Sophie travelled to St Petersburg with her mother. The purpose of the visit was to get her married to the Tsar-in-waiting Peter (later to become Peter III). In the beginning of the summer she was received into the Russian Orthodox Church and was re-christened Catherine. She was married in August 1745. Thus began the process which transformed a minor German princess into one of the most powerful persons in the Western world.

 Catherine is infamous because of a number of things. She had no claims to the Russian throne she was not even Russian. But she overthrew her own husband to declare herself the Queen Empress. She played the game of court intrigue with great finesse. She was ruthless and unscrupulous. She was accused of murder. But all this and none of it was untrue could not take away from the fact that as a ruler she was influenced by the ideas of the Enlightenment. She was a personal friend of Diderot and Voltaire. She built up one of the finest libraries and art collections in Europe. In her ruthlessness and her expansiveness, she was quintessentially Russian, the country she made her own. In her enlightenment, she harked back to Western Europe. In many ways, she was unlike any other Russian ruler.

 Virginia Roundings biography of Catherine concentrates on the person rather than on the diplomatic and political details which occupied much of Catherines career as a ruler. Thus this is emphatically not a biography that covers every aspect of her life and says all that there is to say about her.

 In Roundings own words, What I attempt to do is present Catherine the woman, the multi-faceted, very eighteenth-century woman. To do this she relies on Catherines own words and those of her contemporaries. But her use of these sources has a particular angle. She draws out from these memoirs and accounts those comments, observations and conversations which allow her to re-create Catherine the person.

 Catherines life and career is made to unfold chronologically before our eyes. Rounding thus conveys the impression that the readers are spectators over a distance of 200 years. The approach is sympathetic Rounding describes her protagonist as this most civilized of women and tries to dispel many myths about Catherines debauchery.

 This is the story of a remarkable woman very competently and credibly narrated.

 LEARNING WELL

 The goals that Indian politicians set themselves rarely go beyond their own partisan interests or the next poll. It is not often that a party takes a New Year pledge to implement a particular policy. It should be good news for Bengal that Mr Jyoti Basu wants 2007 to be the year of industrialization. It is another matter that Mr Basus long tenure as the states chief minister had failed to reflect any such determination. Clearly, Mr Basu has learnt a thing or two from his successor, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who is single-mindedly pursuing an agenda for re-industrializing the state. There is a significant angle, though, to Mr Basus remark, which came at the end of the state committee meeting of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). It suggests that Mr Bhattacharjee has been largely successful in forcing a change in the partys populist approach to development. This is no small achievement in a party that thrived on politics rather than on governance even after being in power for nearly thirty years. The bigger issue, however, goes beyond any individual or party. That Bengal needs industries in order to graduate to a modern economy should not have been a matter of debate at all. But politicians are trained to spread confusion. 

 The CPI(M) state committees support to the chief ministers industrialization programme is also timely. Even if the Marxists are at last showing signs of a better understanding of Bengals economic reality, there are many others who have stepped into the comrades old shoes. The agitation against the Tata groups proposed small-car project in Singur is a warning that there are still some takers, led by Ms Mamata Banerjee, for the old leftist politics of obstructionism. The new year may bring for the chief minister two major challenges. As his government goes ahead with implementing several new projects that will require it to acquire large tracts of land, it may also face rising political opposition to these initiatives. The doubters may take to all kinds of methods in order to derail or delay the new projects. It is for the government to defend its policies against illogical, partisan attacks. Mr Bhattacharjee and his party may debate how best to do so. Surrendering the industrialization agenda to political blackmail is not an option open to him. For that would be a great betrayal of Bengals cause.

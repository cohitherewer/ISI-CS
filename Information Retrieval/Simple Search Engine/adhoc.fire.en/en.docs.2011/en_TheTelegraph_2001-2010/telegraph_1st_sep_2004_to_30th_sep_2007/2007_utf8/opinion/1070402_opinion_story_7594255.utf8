The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WITH GUNS, BUT NO GUTS 

 Gwynne Dyer

 Fifth Column

 I dont want to second-guess 

 the British after the fact, said US navy lieutenant-commander, 

 Erik Horner, but our rules of engagement allow a little 

 more latitude. Our boarding teams training is a little 

 bit more towards self-preservation. Does that mean that 

 one of his American boarding teams would have opened fire 

 if it had been on any one of the two inflatable boats that 

 were surrounded by Iranian Revolutionary Guard fast patrol 

 boats off the coast of Iraq? Agreed. Yes.

 Just as well that it was a British 

 boarding team then. The fifteen British sailors and marines 

 who were captured and taken to Tehran for questioning 

 are undoubtedly having an unpleasant time, but they are 

 alive, and Britain is only involved in two wars, in Iraq 

 and in Afghanistan. If it had been one of Horners boarding 

 teams, they would all be dead, and the United States of 

 America and Iran would now be at war.

 Horner is the executive officer 

 of the USS Underwood, the American frigate that works 

 together with HMS Cornwall, the British ship that 

 the captive boarding party came from. Interviewed after 

 the incident by Terri Judd of The Independent, the 

 only British print journalist on HMS Cornwall, he 

 was obviously struggling to be polite about the gutless 

 Brits, but he wasnt having much success.

 The US Navy rules of engagement 

 say we have not only a right to self-defence but also an 

 obligation to self-defence, Horner explained. (The British) 

 had every right in my mind and every justification to defend 

 themselves rather than allow themselves to be taken. Our 

 reaction was, Why didnt your guys defend themselves?

 Another war

 So there they are, eight sailors 

 and seven marines in two rubber boats, with personal weapons 

 and no protection whatever, sitting about a foot above the 

 water, surrounded by six or seven Iranian attack boats with 

 mounted machine guns. Defend yourself by opening fire, 

 and after a single long burst from half a dozen heavy machine-guns 

 there will be fourteen dead young men and one dead young 

 woman in two rapidly sinking inflatables, and your country 

 will be at war. Seems a bit pointless, really.

 It is a cultural thing, at bottom. 

 Britain has a long history of fighting wars and taking casualties, 

 but the combat doctrines are less hairy-chested. British 

 rules of engagement are very much de-escalatory, because 

 we dont want wars starting, explained Sir Alan West, former 

 First Sea Lord. 

 That emollient British approach 

 is probably why the Iranian Revolutionary Guard chose to 

 grab British troops rather than Americans. It was obviously 

 a snatch operation: the Iranians would not normally have 

 half-a-dozen attack boats ready to go even if some coalition 

 boat checking Iraq-bound ships for contraband did stray 

 across the invisible dividing line into Iranian waters.

 According to the US authorities 

 in Iraq, the five Iranian diplomats arrested by US troops 

 in a raid in Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan were actually Revolutionary 

 Guards, and it would seem that their colleagues want them 

 back. Kidnapping American troops as hostages for an exchange 

 could cause a war, so they decided to grab some Brits instead. 

 In this episode, the American 

 reputation for belligerence served US troops well, diverting 

 Iranian attention to the British instead. In the larger 

 scheme of things, it is a bit more problematic. Any day 

 now, a minor clash along Iraqs land or sea frontier with 

 Iran could kill some American troops and give President 

 Bush an excuse to attack Iran, if he wants one and he 

 certainly seems to. If the Revolutionary Guards had got 

 it wrong and attacked an American boarding party, he would 

 have his excuse now, and bombs might already be falling 

 on Iran. All the pieces are in place, and the war could 

 start at any time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Why remember?

 Most Rabindrasangeet singers, who practised and preached their art in the pre-compact disc age, have all but disappeared from collective Bengali memory. But one would have thought that Rajeswari Datta was among the handful still heard and remembered. At Sarat Smriti Sadan on April 17, the programme put together to mark the 90th birth anniversary of the singer made one wish that she had sunk into oblivion like many of her peers. It seemed as if a local nagarik committee had suddenly been asked to remember Datta. Befuddled elderly gentlemen in greying kurta-pyjamas paced all over the hall or went up on stage to talk about the singers proficiency in French and Italian, but few in the audience looked remotely interested or knowledgeable. A lone pigeon flying about amidst whirring ceiling fans added to the general restlessness. Artists were called upon to perform, only to be found missing. The absence of invited panelists led to the shelving of a discussion planned on Dattas many-sided genius. Sanjukta Bhaduri sang Aha tomar shange praner khela and Oi ashantaley, Bandana Khan presented Charandhwani shuni taba nath, without making much impact. Subir Thakur was marginally livelier. Indrani Bhattacharya was adequate, but hardly impressive.

 Sensitive touch 

 Narayan Sahoos solo exhibition, Vision and Realization, at the Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery (till April 24) features works in gouache. The paintings are visually appealing, partly because of the distinctive texture created by the mixed medium, but largely because of the imaginative use of colours, suggesting the artists quiet confidence. The first few works experimented with shades of red and yellow, thrown sharply into relief by quirky touches of blue and black. The most impressive image, in this series, Holy dream, depicts what seemed to be the face of the young Ganesha, smiling in his sleep. The profile of an amused singer, with a singular strand of white hair standing out, looking at a fragile little bird is beautifully enigmatic (Baul-I). The artist departs from his variations on red and yellow with Wonder, which shows a haunting, amazed face perched on a hunched torso, against a luminous background of blue. The motif of the bird returns in Sensitive-I, which shows a smiling face in commune with a delicate bird, and in Young Poet, where a face is turned away from the rougish crow which looms behind it like a curse.

 Deliverance through verses

Provoked (HarperCollins, 8.99) by Kiranjit Ahluwalia and Rahila Gupta is the true tory of a woman who has her first brush with freedom inside prison. Kiranjit Ahluwalia, born to affluent parents, moves to Britain to get married to a man whom she barely knows. Her marriage to Deepak, a cruel and violent man, proves to be disastrous. She has to put up with physical and emotional abuse, almost everyday, and suffer in silence. 

 Ten long years later, unable to bear the torture any longer, Kiranjit retaliates. In a single, desperate act, Kiranjit kills her husband and is handed out a life sentence. While in jail, finally safe from the battering, Kiranjit is able to taste little pleasures that she had missed in her domestic life kindness, friendships and a sense of belonging. Meanwhile, a womens group takes up the cudgel on her behalf, and its sustained campaign and increasing media coverage finally win this woman her freedom. Kiranjits story is of critical importance at many levels. It helped to expose the darker side of domesticity in Asian families living in Britain. Her pardoning also proved to be some sort of a watershed in British legal history. Personal and disturbing at times, the book, co-written with Gupta, has now been turned into a major film with Aishwarya Rai as the protagonist. 

 The men within: A cricketing tale (IndiaLog, Rs 225) by Harimohan Paruvu combines lessons on how to sharpen ones cricketing skills with personal management techniques.It is fairly evident that Paruvu an engineer-cum-investment banker-cum-cricketer is a man of many parts. The novel, written in a succinct style, attempts to capture the finer nuances of the game, along with everything else that is integral to it the passion,drama and the glorious uncertainties that can never be ignored. In the end, Paruvu does not fail to remind the reader that cricket, or any other sport for that matter, is ultimately played not only with hands and feet but also with the mind and heart.

 The Dhammapada (IndiaLog, Rs 195) by Kadambari Kaul brings together the poetic utterances of the Buddha, which have been collected from a myriad sources. The verses in this volume shed light on the sacred philosophy that represents the core of Buddhism as a religion. Kauls introduction, explaining the evolution of the Dhammapada, will be useful to those who are interested in knowing more about the Buddha and his teachings. What is also heartening to note is that all that is needed to guide us along the path of salvation can be fitted into a slim volume such as this one.

An iron Harvest (IndiaInk, Rs 350) by C.P. Surendran is a fictional account of a true story the death of a young Malayali engineering student in police custody and the lone battle fought by the victims father to seek justice in the hands of an indifferent State. Surendrans story is set during the Emergency. John, (who resembles the enigmatic Che) the leader of a revolutionary organization appropriately called Red Earth, suspects that the police have done away with Abe, his classmate. Even as the shadowy group crumbles under the might of a tyrannical State, John embarks on a dangerous tryst to avenge the death of an innocent man. Surendrans language is bleak, and, occasionally, manages to evoke images of a troubled time.

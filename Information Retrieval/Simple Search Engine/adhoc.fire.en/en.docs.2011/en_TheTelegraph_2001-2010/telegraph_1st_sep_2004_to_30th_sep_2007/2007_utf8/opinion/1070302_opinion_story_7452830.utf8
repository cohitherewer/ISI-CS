 PLAYING THE SAME GAME

 Malvika Singh

 Looking at the manner in which economic policies and initiatives ping-pong across the exalted work tables of the cabinet in New Delhi, one gets the rather scary sense of people and minds pulling in different directions. The contradictory signals are distributed across this country, across all socio-economic levels, generating despair because it all becomes an incomprehensible jumble of rhetoric. Chaos and confusion prevail and become increasingly acute with every passing day. And that is what allows the bulky, exclusive, insular bureaucracy, with its archaic and exploitative methodologies, to rule the roost, tie the political class in knots and discredit every scheme meant for the people.

 The impression one gets is that many schemes that are ceremoniously announced at budget time do not show the commitment of the prime minister and the finance minister, who seem to announce much of this on the prompting of the political arm of the UPA. After all, votes come from the political players, and it is that which keeps the government in the gaddi. Unfortunately, the government machinery has not ensured good practice and effective governance. The benefits of people-oriented schemes never reach the poor. The congenital apathy of politicians in the cabinet and their disinterest in the scheme at hand allow the administrators of India to divert financial allocations. Much of it disappear en route, with no accountability. There are no checks. Political parties and their representatives have to pay the price of this form of exploitation that has played havoc with the aspirations of the people as also with democratic processes.

 Ping-pong

 The results of the elections in Uttarakhand and Punjab are also symptomatic of a similar game of ping-pong. First, the Congress functionaries in Delhi, who claim to act on behalf of the Congress president, have constantly interfered with the selection of candidates; they have inflicted their political choice on chief ministers, bringing in people who often operate against the chief ministers. These people are protected by political secretaries in Delhi, who permit them to run amok and destroy competent and effective leadership. Divide and rule from Delhi seems to be the motto of the Congress, as it loses state upon state. 

 The true culprits responsible for the failure of this party continue to rule, their positions within the party intact, their failures to deliver victories unpunished. It is these negative interventions from Delhi that have reduced the Congress into a fast-failing political entity. Those men and women at 24 Akbar Road, who claim they are the real powers behind the throne, are those who are compelling the Congress chariot to hurtle down the slope.

 The constituents, too, have ceased to respect the political class. They appear not to be committed to any party as they play ping-pong at the polls, a game of ruling-party-out-opposition-in. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, the Congress is poised to be in the opposition in virtually every state, much like the Bharatiya Janata Party last time round. Will the Congress yet again push the truth under the carpet? Will its top functionaries lie through their teeth about the reality on the ground? Or will the Congress president take charge and do a radical purge of all the failed office-bearers? Will she bring in unknown, fresh faces, young and inexperienced, who are not carrying the failed baggage of the past? She has nothing to lose if she does. She can only gain from an overhaul.

 There is another option. Stop falling in line with every shout from the allies. Let the government fall. Sit in the opposition. Wait out two years and enjoy the third front tamasha as it takes centre-stage. Then pray for the political ping-pong, to bring you back to the treasury benches!

 RULE OF THREE

 Manmohan Singhs recent description of China on the fringes of the G-8 summit as Indias greatest neighbour captures the essence of a complex relationship between the worlds two most populous countries. China not only offers India a great opportunity, but also poses as great a challenge. While relations between New Delhi and Beijing have matured considerably in recent years, there are clearly points of tension and conflict. The good news first. In the last few years, bilateral ties have improved in a number of areas. Trade between India and China has grown by 56.8 per cent in the first four months of 2007, and has crossed $11.4 billion. It is expected that by 2010, bilateral trade will amount to over $40 billion a year. Similarly, the number of visitors to China from India and vice versa has increased manifold, and there is already considerable Indian investment in China, especially in the IT sector. The view of India and China as two ancient civilizations with strong past links has many takers in both countries.

 However, it is China that is still identified as the most likely source of insecurity to New Delhi and the greatest potential threat to Indian interests in the long-term future. The principal strategic rationale for the construction of a credible and effective Indian nuclear weapon posture is to provide a hedge an insurance policy against the possibility of a belligerent China in an uncertain world. There are many warning signs already. Beijing seems to have consistently regarded a nuclear-armed Pakistan as a crucial regional ally and as a vital counterweight to Indias growing capabilities. The unwillingness, until recently, on Chinas part to settle any of the bilateral irritants to which India attaches importance reinforced this perception. And, as is obvious, Beijing has still not recognized Arunachal Pradesh as part of India. Under the circumstances, what is needed is a three-track Indian policy towards China. 

 First, cooperation with China must be accelerated at all levels. The process of introducing confidence-building measures, which began in the early Nineties, should also be consolidated. Although there are continued reports of incursions by the Chinese across the boundary, these seem to have reduced in the last few years. The second element of Indias strategy towards China should be to expand cooperation with many of Chinas neighbours. The strategy must not be to position New Delhi explicitly as a counter-weight to China, but to slowly and surely enlarge the space of Indian interests, from the Malacca Strait to the Persian Gulf, in order to emerge, potentially in the medium-term future, as a key balancer to China. Finally, India must build an effective minimum nuclear deterrent vis--vis China through a triad of sea, land and air forces.

 LORD OF WAR WHO LOVED PEACE

 Allies and enemies

 Stalins Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939-53 By Geoffrey Roberts, Yale, $ 35

 Josef Stalin continues to remain an enigmatic figure even at the beginning of the 21st century. Marxist scholars like Isaac Deutscher portray Stalin as an epochal hero who transformed backward Russia into a first-class world power equipped with nuclear weapons. From the opposite spectrum, Anglo-American scholars elaborating on the line first expounded by George Kennan assert that Stalins hunger for power resulted in the Cold War. A new historiography, represented by Richard Overy, Heinz Magenheimer, Victor Suvorov among others, claims that Stalin was responsible for starting not only the Cold War, but also the hot war with Germany in June 1941. Geoffrey Roberts attempts a fresh assessment of Stalin in this book.

 Roberts completely rejects the new interpretation that it was Stalin and not Hitler who started the Russo-German War. Stalin, writes Roberts, signed the Nazi-Soviet pact for averting war: and he had no plan to launch a pre-emptive strike against Nazi Germany. It was Hitler who tore the pact apart. Throughout his career Stalin was never interested in a global revolution. He used this concept merely as propaganda. He was only interested to gain a glacis along Russias eastern frontier against a resurgent Germany.

 The author asserts that Stalin was the most effective warlord during World War II. Here, Roberts agrees with A.J.P. Taylor and not with Stalins Glastnost biographer, Dmitrii Volkogonov. Without Stalin, claims Roberts, Russia would have lost the war with Germany. Besides successfully grappling with Hitlers invasion, Stalin played a proactive role in forming the Grand Alliance with Winston Churchill and F.D. Roosevelt. This enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers. Further, Stalin was willing to make the Alliance a success even after the War.

 The onus for the breakdown of the Grand Alliance lay with Roosevelts successor, Harry Truman. The new and comparatively inexperienced Truman was influenced by a group of foreign-ministry hardliners and refused to acknowledge Russias security needs in eastern Europe. The result was the formation of Nato under US leadership. Only after Nato was formed did Moscow organize the Warsaw Pact Alliance.

 Although, after 1946, London and Washington refused to acknowledge Russias strategic and economic interests in eastern Mediterranean (as had originally been agreed in the Potsdam declaration in July 1945), Stalin still pursued a moderate policy. He did not give aid to the communists in Greece, but neither did he follow a rash policy towards Turkey. In fact, claims Roberts, Stalin was not too interested in the Cold War in the periphery. The ruler of North Korea, Kim Sung, and Mao pushed Stalin between 1950-53 into the Korean misadventure.

 Roberts puts forth a strong case for Stalin, arguing that while the US introduced the Monroe doctrine in the American hemisphere, it was unwilling to accept a similar doctrine by Moscow in the aftermath of German defeat. Stalin was not an evil dictator and valued peace more than war. He had no long-term plans for world domination but merely reacted to events. Robertss bulky work, filled with archival citations, challenges some of the new interpretations and offers a balanced picture of Uncle Joe.

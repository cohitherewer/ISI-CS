 THE AURAL IMPRESSION

 Perfecting the accent

 There is a persistent and widespread demand now for audio books but no Indian publisher has taken up the challenge, except for scattered offerings by the Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages. The demand comes from language learning institutes, particularly for conversational English that is free from regional accents. More recently, call centres providing service to British and American firms have called for CDs in spoken British and American accents. Apart from the growing institutional demand, audio books are also required by those with impaired vision: we get these from abroad but only after paying hefty customs duties. Therefore, it is beyond the reach of the individual buyer.

 Why havent we got into the act when the demand for English language speakers grows every year? There are two reasons. First, the technical problem of preparing or burning a CD that would be appropriate for the potential user. Second, the marketing of CDs through retail outlets. Both problems need to be broken down into their component parts to get a hang of whats involved in the making of audio CDs.

 If the audio is being prepared for language learning, the initial steps are much the same as preparing a print edition. It has to be planned, not as a one-off publication, but as a series of four-five books or CDs in a boxed set. The text has to be carefully graded in language, style and subject matter, and spaced out within a vocabulary range of 2000 most frequently used words. This isnt easy because it requires an experienced teacher qualified in the teaching of English as a foreign language to put together a set of five books.

 But the print copy is just the beginning. The real problems begin with voicing the text. Where do you find readers with a clear diction and the proper stresses and pauses that would make the reading intelligible? They are not easy to find in the conventional spaces of schools and undergraduate colleges. We need to go among newsreaders and theatre artists who have been trained to deliver their lines in the right tones. They are out of the publishers reach, and special efforts would have to be made to locate them.

 Assuming this is done, how much does the publisher pay them? Artists can be notoriously expensive when they know it is just a single project and not a full-time contract for a series of books that would ensure a steady income by way of royalties. They would demand a fee that would hike the cost of production beyond the reach of the individual buyer. Besides, there are sundry other costs like studio costs, costs of CDs, distribution costs, and so on.

 What Indian publishers havent figured out is how the collaborative effort between the writer and the reader who voices the text has to be worked out and how much each has to be paid. Perhaps, the publisher has to reach out to the music industry and learn some lessons from them.

 But the real problem comes with the marketing of audio books. What are the retail outlets through which CDs have to be sold? The traditional bookshops or music stores, or a combination of both? What facilities have to be provided to these outlets that would enable the customer to browse a CD? What should be the terms of trade with these retailers? The traditional Indian buyer wants to check out every aspect of the product before spending money on it. Indian publishers who are thinking of moving into this fast growing market need to find the answers from their cousins in the entertainment industry and cut their cloth accordingly. But the market is there because more people want to see and listen rather than go through the solitary task of reading.

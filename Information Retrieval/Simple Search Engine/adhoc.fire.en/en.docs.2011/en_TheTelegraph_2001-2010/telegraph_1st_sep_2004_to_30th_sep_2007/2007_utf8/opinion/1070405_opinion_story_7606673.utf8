 WELCOME MOVES

 Disconnect and be damned. The burdens of history and politics have kept neighbours in south Asia apart even in a globalized world. The summits of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation usually end with the leaders mouthing platitudes and making vague promises. The Indian prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, did something very different at the 14th Saarc summit in New Delhi. By unilaterally liberalizing trade and travel to India from other countries in the region, he has opened up new possibilities for south Asia. His offer marks a welcome departure from the bureaucratic emphasis on reciprocity. If implemented in earnest, these steps can set the region free from a time warp. The withdrawal of tariff and non-tariff barriers on exports from the smaller countries can improve not only their economies, but also their diplomatic relations with India. Similarly, the liberalization of the visa regime can have an impact beyond its economic or diplomatic gains. Mr Singhs gesture signals a change in Indias neighbourhood policy as well. Smaller neighbours, such as Bangladesh, have long complained of large imbalances in their trade with India. They have also accused New Delhi of being discriminatory in selecting items for duty-free trade. Worse, they have seen the Indian restrictions as part of a hegemonic diplomacy. Mr Singhs announcement should go a long way in removing these misgivings.

 In diplomatic terms, the prime ministers move can achieve another important goal. Despite his gesture, the problems between India and Pakistan continue to plague their bilateral trade. Predictably, Pakistan has once again refused to grant India the status of the most favoured nation. In fact, Islamabad continues to be unusually restrictive about the list of Indian goods eligible for duty-free access to Pakistans market. This, despite the fact that both countries lose substantial amount of revenue from the illegal trade that exists between the two countries. The same problem mars the trade between India and Bangladesh. The only realistic answer to it is to legalize and liberalize all trade across the borders. Although Mr Singhs offer will help Indias smaller neighbours more, its signal to Pakistan is unmistakable. An integrated south Asian bloc can better connect with global economic realities.

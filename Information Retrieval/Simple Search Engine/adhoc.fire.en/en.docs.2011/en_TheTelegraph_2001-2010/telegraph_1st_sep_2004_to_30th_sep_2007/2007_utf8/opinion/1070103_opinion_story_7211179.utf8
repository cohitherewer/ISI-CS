 FREEING COAL

 The Supreme Court has stopped Coal India Limited from selling coal to residual customers through e-auctions. CIL sells most of its coal to big industrial consumers on the basis of long-term arrangements at predetermined prices. They are either owned by governments or have clout; they have elbowed out small consumers. The share of traders and small users has dwindled to less than 5 per cent. Some time ago, CIL realized that they could be a milch cow. So it began to hold web auctions for small quantities. It forced all bidders to buy at the highest price offered, irrespective of what their offer was. The Supreme Court adjudged this to be a misuse of CILs monopoly, and forced it to terminate e-auctions. The Supreme Court is correct; as long as CIL has no competition, auctioning coal can be held unfair to consumers. But consumers need coal, and if no one else is allowed to supply it, they can only get it from CIL. Since it releases too little coal to consumers outside long-term linkage arrangements, there is unsatisfied demand. So any coal it offers them must be rationed. The rationing system in force for large consumers, based on their projected requirements, would be too cumbersome for small buyers. 

 The Supreme Courts judgment has created an impasse as far as small buyers are concerned. Further, demand far outruns CILs production capacity; so the government has allowed large consumers such as steel plants to import coal. But not all such consumers are in a position to import; and some, who were allowed, fraudulently sold off imported coal and made good profits. CIL would love to make those profits, and has been pressing the government to allow it to import. The government is now persuaded, but CIL has second thoughts: what if some malcontent consumer went to the Supreme Court and complained about its profits on imported coal? 

 Thus, if the Supreme applies its poorly thought-out principle to imports, CIL will not be able to import at all. That would not be a bad idea if others were allowed. But the government, CILs ever-protective mother, does not allow imported coal to be traded. Import is bulk business and small consumers are incapable of importing for themselves. So one way would be to allow traders to import coal. But even that would not quite solve the problem. For internationally traded coal is of high quality. Many domestic consumers would prefer to have the trashy high-ash coal CIL produces and passes on at throwaway prices to power stations and cement mills. There ought to be a level field; ideally, all CILs coal should be sold by auction. But that would be unfair as long as CIL is a monopoly. Maybe next time the Supreme Court should ask the government to introduce competition by demerging and privatizing CIL and allowing new private entry into coal.

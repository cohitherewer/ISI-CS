The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FOR A FRESH START

 SUMANTA SEN

 Political parties in Bangladesh could not have imagined that things would turn out the way they have. Both the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League had thought that they would be able to manoeuvre the caretaker government to their own advantage when the nation went to the polls. The Awami League did have some success in forcing the government to make changes which it hoped would make the election fair. But the present authorities in Dhaka obviously saw things differently. Its spring-cleaning operation has caught parties by surprise.

 Not a bad thing to happen. Corruption has engulfed the nation since the war of liberation. The repression of the Pakistanis was quickly replaced by that of another kind plunder by ones own kind. Whoever came to power followed the same path. Result impoverished millions on the one hand and an opulent minority on the other. 

 Things obviously reached a stage when the caretaker government had to decide that the decks needed to be cleared before the polls could be held. The net was cast wide and some big fry got caught, including the son of Begum Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister. The Awami League also did not escape the broom. But the current operation clean-up cannot be touching more than the visible dirt. It cannot churn out a new and squeaky clean political-business-administrative class. It can only be a matter of time before collective corruption rears its head again.

 Besides, the present government is functioning with the assistance of the army. Bangladesh has undergone long spells of military rule and knows from experience that the men in uniform are no better when it comes to making their own piles Mohammed Ershad is a case in point. Th- ings have hardly changed for the better. In fact, the top brass is often found to be in league with those not in uniform. 

 Dangers ahead

 Then again, if the army decides to come out of the barracks once again, would that not mean going back to square one? A democratic set-up, no matter how imperfect, leaves ample room for debate and dissent, a military rule does not. In Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf is under a lot of public pressure today, but that is because the arrangement there is quasi-military; the civil forces have not been totally kept out. If the army clamps down again in Dhaka, the political world is sure to be kept at an arms length and with good excuse: arent politicians looters? Also, there will be a lot of talk about restoring order, as is done when a military man takes over. Soon people will realize that the so called order is all about the military ruler making hay for himself.

 From the Indian point of view, army rule may be even more dangerous in the context of Bangladesh harbouring extremists from this country. Right now, the caretaker government may appear to be more receptive to New Delhis complaints but that can only be till Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence begins to apply pressure. And, have no doubts, it will. Of course, as the past has shown, India could hope little from Bangladeshs political forces.

 Then there is the problem of fundamentalism. The BNP is openly in cahoots with the fundamentalists. And the Awami League does not mind turning the other way, when in power, for tactical reasons. That is another cause for concern for India as Islamic fundamentalism does not believe in staying restricted within geographic borders.

 Barring the first couple of years since its birth, Bangladesh has always been a problem child for India, and that is unlikely to change. For Bangladeshis, the present efforts may well turn out to be nothing more than the application of cosmetics which will hide the scars and nothing else. To a beleaguered nation, perhaps, even that is welcome.

 FUTURES PHOBIA

 The decision of the Forward Markets Commission to stop forward trading in arhar and urad follows a sustained rise in their prices. The rise is a part of the inflationary trend in agricultural produce, but has outpaced other agricultural commodities. The FMC obviously believes that speculation can accelerate price rise, and that conversely, a ban on forward trading would decelerate it. On the face of it, this belief is pure superstition. A forward market consists of promises and options to buy and sell a commodity at various future dates. Its existence gives involved parties chiefly farmers and traders a view of how prices are going to behave. This is a view that they can use in their current decisions to produce, buy or sell. It is a convenience that they can use if they want. A farmer can, for example, sell his crop in the forward market before it is harvested. He can thereby eliminate uncertainty regarding what he would get for it; he can even base his decision to produce on the futures price. Similarly, a consumer can secure future supplies at a known price. A forward market is also an instrument for bringing into the open all the factors that may influence the price. If anyone has private information about factors that may influence the price, he will act on it in his trading decisions. The price will thus come to reflect the information available to all players.

 If the cost of holding a commodity is less than the difference between the spot and the forward price, it will pay to hoard the commodity. This is the basis for the belief that speculation leads to hoarding. But all it really does is to raise the spot price in tandem with the futures price. The advancing of a price rise may reduce consumption to some extent and thereby transfer larger stocks into the future. But given the fact that the supplies of a commodity like urad cannot be replenished till the next harvest, consumption till then is limited by supply; speculation can only change the time pattern of consumption.

 The ban on futures trading was uncalled for; but it was worse. It conveys a message that the FMC is capable of such sudden and arbitrary action, and may similarly intervene in any market. As a result of it, those who were holding stocks for the future will have to unload them immediately, and pay warehousing and assaying charges on them. It will increase the participants perception of risk, and make them reluctant to trade futures. It will narrow the futures markets for all commodities, and reduce their utility. This is particularly unfortunate because the FMC had other, less disruptive options. It could have imposed margins on buying and selling. It could have imposed limits on open interest. The FMCs move was ill-considered, and will cost it heavily in terms of diminished credibility.

 VOICE OVER

 For Goa, crises come in incessant waves. Only days ago, its brand new Congress government had been endangered by the rapid withdrawal of support by two members of a supporting party, an independent and a rebel party member. The narrow win of the chief minister, Digamber Kamat, in the floor test in the assembly may have spared the state which has seen 15 chief ministers in two decades another immediate change of government. But its troubles are far from over. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led Opposition is not only unwilling to buy the result of the confidence vote, but has also taken matters to court over the speakers decision to restrain two legislators of the Maharashtra Goa Gomantak Party from voting during the floor test. Matters, indeed, were quite precariously balanced on the eve of the confidence vote. The disqualification of the two MGGP and the rebel Congress member of the legislative assembly had, at one stroke, reduced the strength of the Opposition to 18 in the 40-member house. Given such a situation, it is expected that the speakers role in deciding the vote would be magnified several times over, particularly since it was his single vote, cast in favour of the Congress, that settled the issue. Pratapsinh Rane, the speaker, is now being seen as a convenient tool in the hands of the Congress, which had been a bit too eager to retain the Goa ministry after having lost Uttarakhand, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in successive bouts. 

 This is an unhealthy development, both for Goas political future and for that of the Indian democracy. Yet, this is not the first time that constitutional figures have appeared to play a motivated role. In Goa itself and beyond, in states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and, more recently, Jharkhand, speakers and governors have consistently overstepped their brief to make the situation more comfortable for their preferred political parties or dispensations. One way out could be to strip these constitutional appointments of their political colour. However, even before that takes place, Goa will need to sort out its immediate problem in order to avoid another imposition of presidents rule, as in 2005. For that, both the incumbent power and the Opposition parties will need to work cohesively towards a solution. The intervention of the judiciary will not only delay matters, but also take the initiative out of the hands of the legislature.

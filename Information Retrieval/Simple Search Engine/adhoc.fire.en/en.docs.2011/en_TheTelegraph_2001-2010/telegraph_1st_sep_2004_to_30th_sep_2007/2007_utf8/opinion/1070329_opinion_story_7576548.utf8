The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 READY FOR THE WORLD

 Attempts to denigrate India as a soft power must be countered, even if the critics are Nobel laureates, feels Krishnan Srinivasan

 Thats called hospitality 

 A third-generation descendant in Trinidad of an indentured labourer from India, V.S. Naipaul, now resident in Britain, has declared that, with the honourable exception of the Bengalis, no one in India reads books. A once-upon-a-time legend from Pakistan, Sarfraz Nawaz, expressed the view that the fast bowlers in our cricket team were rubbish. It is not disclosed if this person retracted his words after the recent Johannesburg test match. 

 A British author who writes popular histories and makes his fame and fortune by using India as a workbench, William Dalrymple, implied that Indian historians are lazy and have been ignoring the records in the National pertaining to the sepoy uprising. An Iranian lady, Shirin Ebadi, has condemned our human rights record in Kashmir and the north-east of India, and stated that Indians preferred to look the other way and ignore the violations taking place under your nose. An American economist, Joseph Stiglitz, alleged that India has not managed its farm sector properly and water was already a precious commodity in large parts of our country, where the water table is falling. India is living on borrowed time, he asserted.

 Referring to the behaviour of some visiting sportsmen, which was not considered appropriately sportsman-like, the distinguished tennis correspondent of The Telegraph blamed his fellow-countrymen for placing visitors on a pedestal and making them arrogant because we are too obsequious and welcome them with garlands and tilaks. Indians can be gushing, but are rightly commended the world over for their hospitality. Arrogance is, however, more likely to derive from success than from fulsome airport- and hotel-receptions; the sportsmen in question made more headlines when they lost than when they won because the former result was so rare. And success is what makes the overbearing Board of Control for Cricket in India, which nakedly seeks world domination of the game, so arrogant because it controls the purse-strings. Its very name is reminiscent of the authoritarianism of the dark days of the Stalin era.

 It is not that we are unaware of our failings, though we might be sensitive about the source of criticism levelled at us in some cases. In the five cases cited above, the critics are speaking on matters of their own expertise, and three are winners of the Nobel Prize. How can we fail to be well-informed about ourselves with our free media and the various handicaps we undergo in our everyday lives? According to the democracy index of the Economist Intelligence Unit, India is among 54 flawed democracies, along with countries like Poland, Estonia and Romania, with just about 50 per cent points for political participation and political culture. Twenty-eight countries were considered fully democratic, and none of them from developing countries. Only about 50 per cent of our citizens in the age group 5 to 29 attend any educational institution, and our literacy rate is at around 64 per cent. With half the nations workforce being without education and without prospects of employment, it is hard to justify the grandiose claims projected by the jingoists that Indias largely youthful population will be an important asset in the decades to come. In the only two global sporting events in the world, the football World Cup and the Olympic Games, we are nowhere. India is the AIDS capital of the world in aggregate terms. It also has one in five of the worlds diabetics. Despite having nuclear weapons and talking about space travel by 2020, we seem unable to provide reliable weather forecasts to the public, beyond sunny skies and generally fair. 

 Persons who visit the United States of America and Europe for the first time will be astonished at the usually precise nature of the forecasting, almost to the very hour, when one can expect snow flurries, rain showers and similar natural phenomena. The meteorological authorities here presumably do not think the public can be trusted with such information, in the same way that our local tourist maps do not show the Calcutta airport at Dum Dum or the Fort William. At the same time, India is the biggest buyer of weapon systems in the developing world: nuclear weapons are clearly not enough to ensure our security.

 For all these good reasons, Sonia Gandhi is entirely right in dousing the hyperbolic statements proclaiming Indias potential super-power status. While every advanced country has pockets of deprivation and backwardness, the challenges in India are immense, and while we need not lament our gross domestic product growth rate, we will never eliminate poverty by redistributing our meagre per-capita income. But where attempts to denigrate our status as a soft power in the world are concerned, they need emphatically to be countered. We need not be coy about this: we are already a world soft superpower and the Indian has been globalized. With the exception of the US, India is at the very top of the table.

 Celebrating the success of overseas Indians and marking out some individuals in the diaspora are only a small aspect of this development and is often misplaced, betraying a lack of national self-confidence. To claim the British conservative candidate, Prithi Patel, or Miss Great Britain, Preeti Desai, as our success stories and as new model Indians is as absurd as Germany claiming Henry Kissinger or Britain Kylie Minogue as their own. Leaving aside this overwrought enthusiasm for Indians living abroad, it is the nature of globalization that has brought enormous prestige to the doorsteps of our businessmen, to our musicians and performing artists, to those in the plastic arts, to the holders of shares and mutual funds, to designers, architects, writers, chefs and people associated with the film industry, all of them right here in India.

 The globalized Indian is far from the image of the person without potable water, healthcare, retirement benefits, electricity, access to justice, education or sanitation. He is not identified by caste, creed or religion. It is the image of a person with abundant talent, a gift for entrepreneurship, cosmopolitanism and with enduring cultural and philosophical values. It is this globalized Indian that has attracted the attention of the rest of the world as a coming force, and it is this person that is changing for better, or for worse, as some people might say certain strata of Indian society rapidly and irrevocably, with commercialization, conspicuous consumption and higher wages and prices. This trend is here to stay, and if we do not like it, we nevertheless have to recognize what it implies and reconcile ourselves to it. Because, like globalization itself, it is irreversible.

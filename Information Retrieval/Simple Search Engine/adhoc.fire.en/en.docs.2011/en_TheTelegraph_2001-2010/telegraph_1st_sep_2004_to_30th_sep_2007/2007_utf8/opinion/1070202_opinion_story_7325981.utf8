 Letters to Editor

 Great divide

 Sir Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article, All is not well (Jan 28), holds up the mirror to contemporary India, as seen and experienced by the average citizen. An assessment of the post-globalization Indian economy would provide more reason for despair than for celebration. While liberalization of the economy has fattened the coffers of the already-rich, it has heightened the aspirations of the poor and the middle-class without giving them the opportunities of realizing their dreams. The West might marvel at or envy the achievements of the Ambanis and the Tatas, but millions in the country still remain without adequate food and shelter. And with the extremely rich existing side by side with the poorest of the poor, the discontent of the people is increasing by the day. The rise in the number of terrorist groups like the Maoists or the Kamtapuris is proof of the growing frustration of the disadvantaged. India cannot be said to be on the path of progress unless the poor and the middle classes get to enjoy the fruits of globalization on a par with the rich. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir India has always been a country that has reconciled opposites within its society and economy. It is only in post-liberalization India that the opposites have started clashing. In that way, liberalization has been less of a boon than it is commonly perceived to be. Apart from widening the gap between the rich and the poor, globalization has also played havoc with the culture of India. The young generation has lost its identity trying to imitate the ways of the West. Young boys and girls look, speak and dress alike nowadays. Perhaps this is as much an area of concern as is the broadening economic divide between the classes.

 Yours faithfully, 

R. Kumar, Calcutta

 Sir Sunanda K. Datta-Ray might feel elated at the success of the Indian industrialists in the world market. But their achievement does not seem so spectacular when compared to the recent accomplishments by other Asian countries. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Unholy alliance

 Sir The Telegraphs current obsession with the Bachchan family is proving to be quite tiresome. The Bachchans, along with their daughter-in-law to-be, Aishwarya Rai, are featured on the pages of the daily almost every other day. The front-page news report, Tied in knots over a red dot (Jan 28), and the photograph of the vermilion-smeared Bachchans and Rai with the suggestive dot on her forehead, surely did not deserve the position of prominence accorded to them. The brouhaha over all the pre-nuptial rituals being carried out by the Bachchans prior to the marriage of Abhishek Bachchan with Rai is all the more disgusting since bigoted beliefs in the inauspicious position of the planets in Rais horoscope have occasioned the ceremonies. It is quite unthinkable that an educated family of the 21st century can endorse such superstitious practices by taking part in a public ceremony meant to free Rai of manglik dosha. Being an icon in India, Amitabh Bachchan should have been more circumspect about his behaviour in public so as not to send the wrong message to the people. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir Amitabh Bachchan, who has always been a good actor on screen, continues to be so in real life too. But even his most ardent fans have to acknowledge that the show which he and his family gave at the Vindhyavasini temple in Mirzapur was in very bad taste. It is difficult to believe that the family was wasting thousands of rupees on a ceremony intended to clear the Mars jinx in Aishwarya Rais horoscope. Rai, a former Miss World, could have remembered what she had mouthed during the pageant and given the money to the poor instead. And one wonders what the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav, was doing at the puja. Was the occasion an event of national interest that the chief minister of the state had to grace with his presence? 

 Yours faithfully,

Soma Datta, Siliguri

 Sir It was quite insulting for the reader to be told by The Telegraph that Every time Aishwarya Rai accompanies the Bachchans to a temple, the country is breathless, since most readers would not care less if Rai married Salman Khan or Vivek Oberoi instead of Abhishek Bachchan. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Arun Azad Purty, Jamshedpur 

 Sir It is unfair of the media to meddle in the personal affairs of the Bachchan household. If the Bachchans think that pujas are likely to brighten the prospects of their son and future daughter-in-law, then they should be allowed to worship in peace. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Parting shot

 Sir The government of Delhi has taken a step in the right direction by proposing to make it mandatory for a resident to arrange for a parking space before venturing to purchase a private vehicle (No space to park? Then dont buy car, Jan 29). A generation ago, when only the affluent could afford cars, people took care to build a garage before buying a car. Things have changed dramatically over the last few decades. The rise in the production of cars, the fall in their prices and easily available car loans have made it possible for a larger cross-section of people to possess a vehicle. However, only a few of them have garage-space to park their vehicle. As a result, cars can be found parked in alleys, pavements and passageways, causing much inconvenience to pedestrians. Delhiites would have reason to thank their government if the proposal is implemented. Calcuttas municipal authorities should learn from their Delhi counterparts. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

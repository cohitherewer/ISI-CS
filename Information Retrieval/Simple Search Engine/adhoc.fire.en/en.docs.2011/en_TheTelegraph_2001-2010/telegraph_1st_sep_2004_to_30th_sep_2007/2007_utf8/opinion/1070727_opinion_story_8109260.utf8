 THE LONG WAIT FOR A MESSIAH

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It is truly strange to see the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership fall in line with the president of India, Pratibha Patil, after having carried out a vicious campaign to demean her, using an ever-obliging media to deliver the blows. All the party leaders were present at the swearing-in ceremony, but this time, without the swear words! This only goes to show that politics in India has been reduced to a form of fine-tuned hypocrisy. 

 Indian politics lacks conviction, commitment and constructive criticism. There is no space for grace, culture or a sense of propriety in it. Little wonder then that Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Naveen Patnaik and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stand out in the crowd of political leaders. These four leaders embody the qualities people look for in politicians. Their ability to rise above the mundane has helped in building an aura around them.

 The obscenities that were hurled by the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Y.S. Rajsekhar Reddy, at Chandrababu Naidu in the state assembly were totally unwarranted and unacceptable. It is a shame that the people of India have to bear this kind of behaviour from their leaders. Had the Congress president suspended the Andhra Pradesh chief minister for his performance, she would have helped set an example that would have deterred other politicians from behaving in an objectionable manner.

 To set fresh standards has now become imperative if we are to mature into an international power. Our leaders contemptible and dishonourable conduct has made the nation into a laughing stock in front of the world. India, with all its inherent strengths, its past philosophies, and its established role in international politics, is now being shunned and forced into a corner as a result of the incompetence of the majority of leaders. Where are the Nehrus and the Patels in 21st century India? Where are the men who had served this country and the then political leadership with intellectual and personal integrity?

 New start

 The bizarre, new values propagated by our political leaders are being incorporated by lumpen elements. The rise in the number of crimes such as rape, eve-teasing, cheating, rash-driving, bribing the authority to evade punishment, abuse, use of bad language on television shows and so on is a result of the moral degradation and corruption of the political class. It has set certain standards of behaviour that are followed by their supporters. They are responsible for the breakdown of morality across the land. Their actions condone crimes, thereby leading to horrific incidents in the sub-continent. India is waiting for a messiah, who will lead the nation with integrity and dignity. Those lacking such character traits would not be allowed to assume positions of leadership. Political cleansing is what India is crying out for.

 The corruption of our polity is the result of the actions that have been committed by those who rule us. The new generation is ashamed of this socio-political legacy. It looks upon this reality with deep scorn and resentment. Young people are patiently waiting their turn to set the standards. Unfortunately, ancient, doddering men and women who have embedded themselves in the polity are refusing to give up their chairs and pass the baton on because they fear being exposed for their countless misdemeanours. Their actions have resulted in India remaining poor and backward.

 Today, our city streets are a nightmare. The roads are potholed, showing that money was made by those in charge of building them. Municipalities are corrupt, mafias run the show, and bribery is the rule of the day. India will be forced to explode and then renew itself.

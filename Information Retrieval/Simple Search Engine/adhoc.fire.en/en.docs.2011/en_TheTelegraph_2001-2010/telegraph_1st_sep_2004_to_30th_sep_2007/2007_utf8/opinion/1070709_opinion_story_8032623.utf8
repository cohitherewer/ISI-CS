 PAST IMPERFECT

 One little folly can breed a snowballing mass of foolishnesses. Suspicions about the nationalism of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat may sound morally elevated but, in the present bickering over and around the two presidential candidates, supporters on each side are dredging up almost invisible slime from the bottom of their respective barrels. Whether or not Mr Shekhawat actually took a Rs 15 bribe when he was a constable before 1948, whether he can be called a nationalist since he was in the police force when the British ruled and left it only after India became independent, whether his having been a good constable all those light-years ago means he used to beat up freedom-fighters at the behest of the British police, and so endlessly on, are hardly questions to be asked, even in irony, before the election of a president of India. Maybe the few more days before the election will show that it is possible to sink even further in this exchange of witless accusations, which cannot even be dignified by the name of mud-slinging. Behind this singular stupidity or perhaps multifarious idiocies is the United Progressive Alliances choice of a conveniently colourless candidate in order to win the support of its allies, especially the left.

 The UPAs hope of having scored a bulls eye with a woman candidate has remained unfulfilled. The National Democratic Alliance has unloosed a spate of corruption charges or allegations against Pratibha Patil. No one wants to move on these allegations; it is enough that they should be made. The idea is to emphasize the unacceptability of Ms Patil as president, just as it is the UPAs idea to point to Mr Shekhawats unfitness for the same chair. Questions about Mr Shekhawats nationalism have predictably made the NDA jump on its hobby-horse even though it has been ridden to death: who is the UPA to talk of nationalism when the Congress president is a foreigner? The spat exposes the bankruptcy of Indias political class it has neither wicked ideas nor guts. No party has the courage to suggest the name of an eminent personality, free of specific party loyalties, as presidential candidate. Yet that is what it should have been. The net result is a further degeneration of political culture, and another step towards converting political ideology and action into just an exchange of empty abuse.

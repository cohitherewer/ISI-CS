 PRETTY AS A PICTURE 

 Neha Sahay

 CHINA DIARY

 Guangzhou is beautiful and depressing. 

 Its old district, home to many colonial-style buildings 

 dating from the days of Canton (the citys old name), is 

 cool and serene; the riverfront is bewitching, with its 

 discreetly-lit trees and glittering boats taking tourists 

 for dinner cruises down the Pearl River under beautiful, 

 arched bridges. One can spend the evening walking along 

 the promenade, then step into the small, but popular, German 

 caf facing it, or go up to the Ai Qun restaurant in the 

 grand hotel with the same name to hear Chinese opera-style 

 singing and eat Cantonese food.

 The 13-storeyed Ai Qun, built 

 in 1937, was the first big hotel in south China, host to 

 Premier Chou En Lai. Unlike the other multi-storeyed monstrosities 

 that currently dot the skylines of Chinas cities, Ai Qun 

 has retained its imposing presence, despite the addition 

 of a new building and four more floors. Perhaps that is 

 the reason rooms are always available, and that too at half 

 the rates charged by modern hotels. 

 The hotel, proud of its years 

 of brilliant history, calls itself the kempon (the 

 champion?) of south China. The hotel, we are told in quaint 

 Chinglish, operates under the service principle of Customer 

 First, Credit First, Fine Quality Service and Guests Feel 

 at Home. Guests are requested to self-consciously comply 

 with each rules of the Guest-Stay notice. These include 

 no going whoring and no nuking and leave the room just 

 wear the underwear. Guests are also forbidden to carry 

 terrible smell goods into the hotel, and meet the wire without 

 permission. Theres no fixed punishment, however, for violating 

 the rules. It varies from got the criticism, fine or solved 

 by the relative department based on the situation. No wonder, 

 the hotel lives up to its promise of surely make you into 

 thinking and cosy.

 A few warts

 The coffee shop has Economic 

 Breakfast and Pulverizing Coffee; the menu of the new revolving 

 restaurant (apart from offering the presumably delectable 

 Boiled Scorpion), has a few Indian dishes, under the subhead: 

 India a round flat cake.Guangzhous historical past has 

 survived despite the extreme changes it has undergone. Just 

 round the corner of the majestic old cathedral in the old 

 Western quarter, are the markets laden with dry fish and 

 dry fruit. As the capital of the southern Guangdong, the 

 stage for Deng Xiaopings opening up policy, Guangzhou 

 reflects both the frenetic pace as well as the grandeur 

 befitting its history and significance. Come evening, as 

 the lights come on along the riverfront, downtown traffic 

 crawls at a snails pace. With its overcrowded buses and 

 state-of-the-art Metro, Guangzhou just got another means 

 of public transport ferries.

 The city continues to be home 

 to foreigners; there is an entire mini-India here, where 

 everything, including papads and latest DVDs, is 

 available and boys play cricket between the buildings. Africans 

 too have their own corner: a series of downtown restaurants 

 serving African and Arab food, with Arab cooks and an all-African-Asian 

 clientele. 

 Like all big Chinese cities, Guangzhou 

 has enormous parks replete with lakes, low hills et al. 

 The oldest and biggest of them is in the heart of the city; 

 enter it and you forget the deafening sounds of traffic 

 just outside its gates. As in all open spaces in China, 

 in this park too, the old outnumber the young; and most 

 of them are either doing Taiqi or playing badminton or table 

 tennis. 

 As exhilarating as Guangzhous 

 sights are, its homeless and its destitute depress you. 

 Under busy flyovers, they display deformed babies. Along 

 the riverfront, they sleep under tattered blankets or sit 

 silently, bundled up in old jackets, looking up at the lights 

 of the bars and clubs or waiting for someone to leave a 

 half-eaten meal on a garbage bin.

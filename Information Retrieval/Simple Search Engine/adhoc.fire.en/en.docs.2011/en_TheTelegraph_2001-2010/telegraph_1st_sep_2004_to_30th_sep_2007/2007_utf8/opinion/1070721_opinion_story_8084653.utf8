 MUPPET IN CAP AND GOWN

 As honorary doctors, Shilpa Shetty and Kermit the Frog sound like soulmates. When the latter (a muppet of Sesame Street fame) was awarded, in 1996, an honorary doctorate of amphibious letters by Long Island University, he stood as a happy and humble frog to deliver his commencement address to the distinguished guests. He shared with them how, when he was a tadpole growing up in the swamps, he never imagined that he would one day address such outstanding scholars. May success and a smile always be yours, Kermit wished his fellow graduates, even when youre knee-deep in the sticky muck of life. How perfectly success and a smile describes Ms Shettys British glories, in spite of Germaine Greer finding her smile mirthless and her annoyingness nerve-fraying. (Feminists will never see the point of tinsel.) To think of Jade Goody and her friends as the muck of life does not ask for a great deal of nastiness either.

 Ms Shettys smile works better in London than in Mumbai, and could well become the logo of new New Labours cautious new multiculturalism. (Failed Bollywood is safer than failed Bangalore.) Besides, her smile has come to stand for a kind of resilience a cosmetic stoicism that deals alike with bullying and honours. At the degree ceremony, Ms Shetty described how she cant stop smiling even when she is so overwhelmed and choked with emotions. It would be priggish, therefore, to turn ones nose up at Leeds Metropolitan University for honouring Ms Shetty with a doctorate in arts. The vice-chancellor has lauded her for making a difference with her great dignity and poise. To extend the meaning of the arts, or of academic excellence, like this is a unique way of tackling the crisis of British (and Indian) higher education. Leeds Met has also given honorary degrees to Amitabh Bachchan, Shabana Azmi, Yash Chopra and the minister of state for civil aviation. It has established two academic chairs for the study of global cinema and of India, and partners the International Indian Film Academy in Yorkshire. (What better way to dispel the Brontan gloom of the Yorkshire moors?) So, as always with such things, there is canniness in all this too, political as well as academic.

 Honorary degrees give cultures and institutions bored with themselves something fun to do. Yale gave one to George W. Bush, Oxford made a point of not giving one to Margaret Thatcher (so a university in Buckingham gave her husband one), Cambridge almost did not give one to Jacques Derrida, and Edinburgh gave one to Robert Mugabe only to take it away recently. They can also be collected as Elizabeth Taylor collects emeralds and ex-husbands: Oprah Winfrey has several, and King Bhumibol of Thailand has 136. But giveaway doctorates are generally quite useless. As the artist and honorary doctor, David Hockney, put it once, they do not even allow you to write prescriptions for your own drugs.

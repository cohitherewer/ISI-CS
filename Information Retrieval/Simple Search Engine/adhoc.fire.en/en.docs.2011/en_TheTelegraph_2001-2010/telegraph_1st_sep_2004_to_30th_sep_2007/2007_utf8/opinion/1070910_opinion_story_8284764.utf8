 Troubled legacy

 Sir A high school decided to celebrate Teachers Day for the first time in 55 years but its students and teachers were shut out of the school premises while the local unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) went ahead with its conference inside (Foul play on teacher day, Sept 6). Perhaps the staff and students will also have little to say if the school were converted into a party office. The incident symbolizes the deplorable state of education in Bengal, as well as in India. Primary and secondary education in the state have gone steadily downhill in government and government-sponsored schools. Indian politicians have not only forgotten the significance of Teachers Day but also the legacy of Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rudra Sen,

 Sir With the approach of Teachers Day, the enthusiasm to hold pompous celebrations had assumed a manic proportion in schools around the country. Yet, one wonders how well teachers are heeded and revered by students and the larger society. For one thing is certain, India has still not managed to accord its teaching community the respect it deserves. It is time the contributions of this group of professionals were acknowledged. Teachers often devote long and tedious hours to educate and help others achieve the glory they themselves could not or chose not to embrace. Behind every successful individual is a committed teacher. 

 Yours faithfully,

Swagato Mallick,

 Sir September 5 is recognized as Teachers Day in memory of Indias second president, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. But surprisingly, no educational institution or road in the capital is named after this scholar and philosopher. Perhaps it is time to have a national university in the name of Radhakrishnan. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir For years, teachers have had the licence to physically assault children because it is believed that the young would learn only if they given corporal punishment for their wrongdoing. Of late, there have been numerous reports of teachers using this as licence to beat and humiliate their students in a way that neither befits their social standing nor profession. The gross abuse has triggered public outrage and invited strict measures against corporal punishment in school. In a recent judgment, the Delhi high court has stated that children should be allowed to acquire education with dignity and in an atmosphere free from fear of punishment, physical or otherwise. The court also observed that corporal punishment violates childrens fundamental right to life and equality before law. 

 Teachers obviously do not know where to draw the line. However, while condemning teachers brutality, it is necessary to keep in mind the fact that students and their parents should not be given the right to send teachers to jail at the drop of a hat. That will further alienate students from teachers. The challenge is to find a middle path, where teachers and students learn to maintain the sanctity of a relationship between the guru and shishya.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir The chief minister of West Bengal has asked the prime minister to name any third world country that has benefited from the US embrace(Buddha to Singh: US between us, Sept 7). The answer is Japan. In fact, the embrace of America turned Japan into a first world country. After World War II, Japan came under the protective influence of the United States of America while the erstwhile Soviet Union lorded over the east European countries. In the course of a few decades, Japan had become an economic giant, and a competitor of the US, while east Europe had become a virtual colony of the Soviet Union. Incidentally, the bogey of US imperialism, which is troubling Prakash Karat and his comrades, also reared its head about this time. The Soviet Union prevented its east European satellites from accepting any US aid under the Marshall Plan on the plea that American dollars meant US imperialism. However, west Europe benefited immensely from that aid and continues to be far more prosperous than eastern Europe. Yet, nobody will ever say that France was more subservient to the US than Poland was to the Soviets. As an apolitical Marxist, I would like to tell the Bengal chief minister that foreign investment in Bengal is more in line with Marxs prognosis about capitals evolution and expansion over the world than US imperialism. 

 Yours faithfully,

H.P. Gangopadhyay, 

 Calcutta

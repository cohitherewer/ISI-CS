 MINUS THE KILLER INSTINCT

 Fragging could become a major threat to the Indian army unless something is done about it and fast, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 Losing control

 In yet another sordid case of fragging, a soldier of an elite infantry regiment killed his superior, a Major, on July 23, 2007 in Kashmirs Gurez sector. The soldier, reportedly, shot his senior in a fit of unexplained rage because the Major denied him leave before his death.

 Without repeating the numerous statistical data which keep cropping up after every such suicide or homicide in the barracks of the Indian garrisons in Kashmir and in the Northeast, one should examine the issues, look into the probable reasons, and find a way to curb, if not eliminate, the frequent crisis of confidence in the army regiments.

 When a soldier asks for leave, it would normally imply that he has not taken leave, say, in the last six months. However, in case his leave is refused on grounds of frequent leave in the past, the next question would be, On what ground had he been going on leave?. Did someone superior try to find out what exactly was the problem with the killer infantry soldier? If it is found that the alleged killer has so far been a perfectly disciplined soldier without a record of misbehaviour in the regiment, then perhaps the needle of suspicion should move from the rogue soldier to the superior of the regiment-officers mess

 Even if one were to assume that the killer was denied leave by his superior on legitimate grounds, a few questions remain. Why was he so enraged as to open fire? Did he not realize what he was doing? Did he not know the consequences of his action? Or did his mental faculty fail owing to something? Did the soldier nurse a past grudge or grievance against the deceased Major? There are numerous possibilities, but not one can be surely ascertained.

 However, the one point that emerges is the spread of bad blood in the barracks in insurgency-affected states where the army is called on duty. And that problem needs to be addressed urgently. What looks like a tiny problem which can be easily solved by a section, platoon, or, at best, by a company commander could slowly and steadily grow into a strategic crisis for the Indian army in the long run.

 As we all know, soldiers of the Indian army usually come from rural India. We are also aware that much of Indias rural areas remain beset by caste wars and communal disharmony, most of which are politically-motivated. The lop-sided growth of the Indian economy also contributes to this problem. The army, naturally, reflects the class-structure of the Indian society. English is the language in use in the officers mess and the rural languages of India are spoken in the barracks. It is Hindi in the regiments of Bihar and Rajputana Rifles, Nepali in the Gurkha regiment, Marathi in the Maratha Light Infantry, a mixture of Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam in the Madras regiment, Punjabi in Sikh and Sikh Light Infantry and Kumaoni, Dogri and Garhwali in the respective regiments. 

 An important thing to note is that unlike in the colonial era, these soldiers are alert, more educated than their predecessors during the two world wars, and are no longer isolated from the maladies that afflict urban India. Day in and day out, these recruits face the harsh reality of corruption, caste conflict, communalism and the antics of the local dadas and their conmen. They see an ugly, indisciplined and defiant India back home and face a life of diametrically opposite dimension inside the regiment, which demands from them discipline, decorum, duty, discretion and devotion.

 Napoleon had once said that there are no bad soldiers, only bad commanders. This is regarded as the gospel truth the world over, and training, accordingly, is imparted to all ranks. It would be nave to believe that the commander of a unit is solely responsible for any untoward incident or mishap that may happen. Nevertheless, the behaviour and attitude of the superior towards his subordinate go a long way in determining the core competence of any organization, civil or military, but more crucially of a uniformed service. 

 Why so? This is because soldiering is always a unique and unusual profession wherein soldiers, especially those belonging to the infantry, are taught to fight, shoot and kill the enemy from day one. The word used is dushman (enemy), who has to be identified, tracked, targeted, shot and then buried with full honour. Why honour the dead body of the enemy? This is because a dead man is no longer an enemy, and you could also be dead while fighting the enemy. If you honour the enemy in his death, he too will reciprocate in honouring the body.

 When the soldier killed his superior, he identified him, if even for a fraction of a second, as his enemy who needed to be targeted and finished off. Only, in this case, the enemy did not need to be tracked down; he was served on a platter. Only the trigger needed to be pulled.

 An irreparable damage is done to the ethos of the army in this way. Seeds of suspicion are sown in the minds of not only the soldiers, but also their superiors. Mutual trust breaks down. For the army, this is suicidal. It is perhaps time to constitute a commission of experts to look into the entire gamut of Indian soldiering.

 While writing this article, I remembered a memorable incident in my life. My father-in-law died on my wifes 24th birthday, on March 30, 1978. The funeral rites were to be held on Friday, April 9. I went up to the superior officer for a days leave as April 10, the second Saturday of the month, and April 11, a Sunday, were holidays. I did get a days leave, but only after having been bad-mouthed for at least fifteen minutes. I wish I had a Kalashnikov in my hand 29 years ago. My superior officer obviously did not know the difference between bona fide and mala fide. The boss is always the boss. He is always right, even when wrong, and sometimes quite insensitive to the junior.

 NATURE AGAINST MAN

 The curse of Chief Seattle has now begun to haunt the world and mankind. He said in 1854 that mans appetite will devour the earth and leave behind only a desert. The report submitted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has confirmed the impressionistic evidence of global warming. The report says that the average global temperature may rise by one degree Centigrade to 6 degrees Centigrade over the next 90 years. The consequences of this will be devastating for the world and for mankind. The polar ice caps will melt, sea levels would rise, low-lying areas will be inundated and, across the globe, there will be an intensification of cyclones and extreme weather conditions. What is worse is that the report clearly makes human beings and their activities responsible for the dramatic, if not apocalyptic, changes in the worlds environment.

 Ever since the 16th century, man has seen nature as an object to be limited and used and exploited. This was the modern world-views major break from that of the pre-modern world. The drive towards modernization has always been at the cost of the environment. Man, as he conquered more and more of nature, began to assume that the earth belongs to man when, in reality, man belongs to the earth. There was an unbridgeable alienation between man and the natural world. There is no denying that the great achievements of the modern age have all taken place because man has been able to use nature for his own welfare and benefit. The awareness that the natural world is something to be preserved and maintained has come only recently, after the environment has been irreparably damaged. But even this awareness has not been able to completely stop mans relentless drive to use nature and its resources. This has produced the situation where mans exploitation of nature and neglect of it are beginning to threaten mans own existence.

 Humankind is thus trapped in a condition that is the result of its own desires and greed. Man must learn how he can live with nature without actually using it and damaging it. He must also learn not to waste and pollute or else, as Chief Seattle predicted, man will suffocate himself. The evidence shows that practically every single human activity from agriculture to industry harms the environment, but human beings give very little back to nature. It is a hugely unequal exchange. It is easy to ignore the environment with the argument that it is a problem of the future. But the future, as the IPCC report shows, is now upon mankind and threatens to destroy it. The neglect of the environment can actually reduce to naught all the great achievements of mankind since the species itself might disappear. The problem is no longer a philosophical one. It has immediate practical implications which need to be addressed with a certain urgency. The problem is one of survival. Climate has begun to change, leaving human beings precious little time to usher in a climate of change. The bell has begun to toll.

 Letters to Editor

 Fire and brimstone

Out of reckoning

 Sir It is unfortunate that Kiran Bedi has been superseded by Yudhvir Singh Dadwal (Denied Delhi, first lady of cops cries bias, July 26). Dadwal was appointed Delhis police commissioner despite the controversy over his presence at the site of Jessica Lals murder. The United Progressive Alliance and the Left have been championing the cause of womens empowerment, and have even got Pratibha Patil elected to the post of the president on that pretext. Why then did the UPA government desist from appointing a female police commissioner for Delhi? Kiran Bedi, however, does not need the excuse of womens empowerment to lay claim to the post. Her ability as a police officer is well-proven. Citizens should take recourse to the Right to Information Act to find out if the appointment of Dadwal was the result of networking and nepotism. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir The criteria of both seniority and capability were overlooked in the appointment of Yudhvir Dadwal. There may be some truth in Kiran Bedis allegation that the bureaucracys fear of police reform is the reason for her unpopularity. Babus have steadfastly resisted change, be it in the police or in the other administrative services.

 Yours faithfully,

Atanu Dey, Diphu, Assam

 Sir It is ironical that Indias first woman IPS officer was denied the post of Delhis police commissioner the same day that another woman, Pratibha Patil, became the supreme commander of the armed forces and the nations first citizen. Indians have the right to know why Bedi was overlooked. However, there is no reason to believe that Yudhvir Dadwal will not perform as well as Bedi would have. In any case, it was not right on the part of Bedi to go public against Dadwals appointment. Instead, she could have gone to court. Since Bedi has been a role model, it is all the more important that she preserves her image.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir The National Commission for Women should probe Kiran Bedis allegation of gender bias. It should be noted that the Central Information Commission has clarified that, notwithstanding the prime ministers assurances, it will pursue the case of alleged bias in the appointment of Shiv Shankar Menon as foreign secretary, ignoring the claims of others like Veena Sikri. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Denying Kiran Bedi the post of the police commissioner of Delhi is an indication not only of gender bias, but also of political bias. The appointment has cast serious doubts on claims of transparency in the system. While Bedis police reforms ably demonstrate her abilities, Y.S. Dadwal has always ducked media queries about his alleged presence at the Jessica Lal murder site. His appointment proves that for a babu, influence is all that matters. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abu Salim, Darjeeling

 Sir Kiran Bedis predicament is shocking. With crime on the rise, the capital has become the most dangerous city in India. Someone like Kiran Bedi was needed to tackle Delhis criminals, who, at present, carry on with impunity. Unfortunately, the UPA has never failed to show its disregard for merit. The government knows that it will not be easy to browbeat Bedi into ignoring the criminals close to its politicians. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 Sir Kiran Bedi should have known that a Magsasay award, work with the United Nations or impeccable credentials like hers do not get one very far in India. One needs to grease palms and push the agenda of the party in power. Bedis political masters have no fondness for her no-nonsense attitude or outspokenness. From Dwight D. Eisenhowers controversial appointment as the supreme commander of the Allied forces to Mayavati nominating a lowly officer as her cabinet secretary, supersessions are no exception. The UPAs choice of the Union cabinet secretary and the foreign secretary, too, were hardly determined by merit or seniority. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Burdwan 

 Sir Kiran Bedi should have avoided commenting on the appointment of Y.S. Dadwal in public. She could have gone to the Central Administrative Tribunal. However, the government is not obliged to convey each and every detail about the matter to her or the public. 

 Yours faithfully, 

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir India is witnessing the empowerment of a single woman. With a puppet president and an ineffective prime minister in office, Sonia Gandhi has practically become the dictator of the country. With such a sham being perpetrated in the name of advancement for women, it is not surprising that Kiran Bedi has been given the short shrift. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir Perhaps the fear of politicians names being revealed in various corruption cases in and around the capital and Kiran Bedis reputed neutrality scared Sheila Dixit as well as the Union government. Unlike Pratibha Patil, Bedi would certainly not have been a rubber stamp. The government will make every effort to paint her outburst as malicious and consolidate Dadwals position.

 Yours faithfully, 

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

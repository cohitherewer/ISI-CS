The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DEBATE BENGALI 

 STYLE 

 - The all-party talks on land acquisition were designed to 

 fail 

 WRITING ON THE WALL

 ASHOK V. DESAI

 On March 13, I wrote a comment 

 in The Telegraph on the Indian conception of democracy. 

 Elsewhere in Europe in particular democracy is taken 

 to be a peaceful way of settling differences. It involves 

 elections as ours does; but in most of Europe, elections 

 are not entirely first-past-the-post. There is proportional 

 representation. The seats a party gets do not depend on 

 its candidates getting more votes than their competitors; 

 they depend on the proportion of total votes the parties 

 poll. In Germany, for instance, a party gets some seats 

 in parliament as long as it gets more than 5 per cent of 

 the votes. An element of luck is unavoidable in the first-past-the-post 

 system. The Congress scored in our last general election, 

 not because more electors voted for it, but because the 

 newly formed Telengana Rashtra Samity took some seats from 

 the Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh. This local accident 

 brought the house of the Bharatiya Janata Party tumbling 

 down, and gave a surprised Congress a shot at power. The 

 formation of the United Progressive Alliance government 

 did not bring a more popular coalition to power; it was 

 not an outcome desired by a majority, or even by a larger 

 plurality of voters. 

 Another difference between Indian 

 and European legislatures is that, in India, a member addresses 

 the house from his seat, wherever it is situated. So if 

 a backbencher speaks, his own party members have to turn 

 and crane their necks to look at him; backbenchers on the 

 opposite side need binoculars. Although the German parliament 

 is a circular one like Indias, no one has to contort himself. 

 Whoever is given the floor by the speaker must walk down 

 to a podium situated in the well just below the speaker. 

 From there he is clearly seen by every member, and is below 

 the eye level of most members. They have no difficulty in 

 following him. And they dare not interrupt him; the speaker 

 would admonish them if they did so. 

 Another difference is in the way 

 members dress. In India, members of parliament make it a 

 point to dress sloppily; most wear ill-fitting kurtas 

 and pyjamas. Mani Shankar Aiyar is a good example; 

 just in case his clothes are not undistinguished enough, 

 he also tousles his hair. Bengali legislators are more sophisticated; 

 they wear panjabis. But to my uncultured eye, panjabis 

 look no different from kurtas. (My tailor once told me, 

 however, that the MPs slovenliness was just a show that 

 his MP clients wore tailored clothes, made out of terrycotton 

 specially designed to look like khadi.) In European 

 parliaments, on the other hand, virtually everyone wears 

 a suit. This may sound trivial. But a persons clothes reflect 

 his self-esteem; our legislators have as little respect 

 for themselves as their constituents have for them. Clothes 

 define the atmosphere. The street clothes of our legislators 

 are appropriate for rioting in the house; members who wear 

 a suit and tie are unlikely to shout and break furniture. 

 All these elements the design 

 of the houses, the way people dress, and the way they treat 

 the speaker limit what European legislators do. They study 

 legislation, they write down their speeches, and they debate 

 seriously, whereas most of our legislators do not know what 

 debating is. The budget is the countrys most important 

 document; it is the instrument parliament is supposed to 

 use to control the government. But MPs had so little to 

 say about it or about anything else that they ended 

 the budget session long before its scheduled completion 

 and went home. 

 The occasion on which I had written 

 my last column was the killings in Singur. They were precisely 

 what democracy was designed to prevent, if it was a peaceful 

 way of settling differences. But Indian politicians conception 

 of democracy is very different. They think that elections 

 are all there is to democracy, and that they decide who 

 is to rule a state or the country for five years. Whereas 

 in Europe, the duty to consult and debate does not end with 

 an election; an election only decides who will participate 

 in the debates.

 The context in which I wrote my 

 column was the way the West Bengal government was dealing 

 with discontent over its land acquisition letting the 

 gun and the stick do the talking for it. But even before 

 I wrote, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had realized the ineffectiveness 

 of force; last October, he talked of an all-party meeting. 

 At that time, Mamata Banerjee had asked for an apology from 

 him. He said in response that it was not his intention that 

 an unfortunate incident should have occurred in Singur; 

 that it would have been better if police action had not 

 been necessary. I thought this statement was hamhanded. 

 He wanted a change of direction; he wanted the opposition 

 to stop agitating. He should have asked himself: how can 

 I achieve my objective? Saying sorry, let us find a more 

 inclusive way forward was essential. Instead, he got stuck 

 in false pride, and made an ineffective move. 

 So it took till May to hold a 

 meeting. The press report says that Mamata Banerjee broke 

 it up because the Communist Party of India (Marxist) representatives 

 did not accept her description of the massacre in Nandigram 

 as genocide. We should ask: why did Mamata attend the meeting? 

 Because it would put her in the news. And why did she break 

 it up? Because there were no benefits to attending the meeting, 

 and no costs to breaking it up. Buddhadeb had copped out 

 of the meeting, and given those who attended it a message 

 that it did not matter. And the entire format was so bureaucratic 

 representatives of established parties sitting in a square 

 over tea and biscuits and making set speeches. It was designed 

 to have people talk at each other, not to each other. It 

 gave every indication that no business was to be done, no 

 one was to be taken seriously. It was planned, meant, and 

 designed to be a show. It was planned to fail. 

 Maybe Buddhadeb can afford this 

 failure. But he cannot continue to fail. The conflict over 

 land acquisition in West Bengal is so bitter that even if 

 it does not bring down Buddhadeb, it can emasculate him 

 he will not be able to provide leadership or take effective 

 action on anything. He cannot overcome the conflict by stilted, 

 ritualistic action. He should be giving a loud message to 

 everyone: I am sorry. I have changed. I am determined to 

 carry you all in the quest for development. He should not 

 seek to talk just to the jagirdars of power the 

 party representatives he should be looking for lines of 

 communication with the opposition on the ground in Singur 

 and Nandigram. He should not be complaining about his ill 

 health; he should be enquiring about the health of those 

 his government has harmed. He should be listening a lot 

 more to his adversaries, not his friends and talking 

 a lot less. He should seek to change his image; and for 

 that he should be showing himself a lot more. He should 

 cease to be a marionette of his party. He should stand up 

 and show that he is his own man.

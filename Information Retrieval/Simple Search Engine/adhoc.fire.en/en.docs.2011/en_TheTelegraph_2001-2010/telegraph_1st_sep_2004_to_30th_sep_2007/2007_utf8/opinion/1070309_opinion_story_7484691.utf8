 A PRINCE AND A PM

 Karan Singh, 1965

 Jammu and Kashmir 1949-64: Select correspondence between Jawaharlal Nehru and Karan Singh, 

 Edited by Jawaid Alam, 

 Penguin, Rs 595 

 Letter writing, when it takes place between two public figures, not only gives us a glance into the history of their times, but also helps us understand the characters of the men undertaking such a task. And when the topic of correspondence happens to be Kashmir, the interest never dims. 

 Kashmir, known as the paradise on earth, has, ironically, been the bone of contention from the day it was acceded to India. Jawaid Alams book collects the letters that were written by the first prime minister of India to the first regent of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It should not be missed by people interested in the political history of the state. This correspondence between Jawaharlal Nehru and Karan Singh, from 1949 to 1964, focuses largely on Jammu and Kashmir, though there are some letters concerning international affairs vis--vis the state of Kashmir. The book also carries a foreword by Sonia Gandhi and a short preface by Karan Singh himself. Jawaid Alam comments on the correspondence, relating it to the political developments in the state from 1949 to 1964. In an appendix, Alam also includes some important letters of Maharaja Hari Singh, father of Karan Singh and the ruler of the state since 1925. 

 This book collects 216 letters, exchanged between Jawaharlal Nehru and Karan Singh for 15 years, that not only reveal the relationship between two individuals but also between the newly- independent India and the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Karan Singh was still in his teens when Nehru made him the regent and brought him into the troubled arena of mainstream politics. The letters record how this state, with a young ruler, was guided by one of the finest statesmen of all times. If the questions asked by Singh are urgent, the answers by Nehru reflect his statesmanship and ability to tutor. 

 Most of Singhs letters either relate to personal details or are about Kashmir. The letters from 1952 onwards reveal the maturing voice of Karan Singh, who was, by then, given the title of Sadar-i-Riyasat, and hailed by Nehru as the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Kashmir . 

 The letters of 1953 reflect the most difficult phase in the relationship between India and Kashmir. These letters document the varying relationship between Nehru and Singh and how Nehrus opinion of Sheikh Abdullah changed during this time. The letters of 1955 and 1958 focus mainly on international affairs. 

 Other topics that were taken up include administrative matters, Sheikh Abdullah s detention, and views about Nepal, internal politics of Jammu and Kashmir, the growing Chinese influence and the resignation of Bakshi Gholam Mohammad. The longest is a letter from Karan Singh, on his return from the Soviet Union in 1959, to Nehru. It runs into some 37 odd pages and is interesting and informative. It gives us a glimpse of the glorious days of Soviet power.

 Though tagged at the very end of the book, Hari Singhs letters to the president, prime minister and others, also deserve consideration. The questions Hari Singh raised demand serious thinking. All the letters in this book are invaluable for understanding the history of Jammu and Kashmir, but they would hardly interest the general reader.

 ELECTIONS NOW

 In politics, it is often wrong to postpone the inevitable. The point has come when Manmohan Singh should recognize and accept this. A complete breach with the Left is now unavoidable. If the break does not come now, it will happen in the very near future. More critically, Mr Singh must consider if the dignity of the prime ministers office will be preserved if he continues to hold the top job with Prakash Karat and his ilk holding a gun to his temple. The clinging to office cannot be more important than the dignity of the office. There is a clear way out for the prime minister. He must recommend to the president that the 14th Lok Sabha be dissolved, and the election commission be asked to arrange for general elections as soon as possible. This may sound like an extreme solution, but the situation, as most observers admit, has reached an extreme and irretrievable point.

 It is obvious from the various pronouncements made by Mr Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), that the Lefts objections go far beyond the clauses of the Indo-US nuclear deal. The Left is fundamentally opposed to Indias growing closeness to the United States of America, the last and principal ogre of the leftists. This is not something that Mr Singh can address. Nor can he, as the prime minister, take cognizance of objections rooted in prejudice. The Left, led by Mr Karat, is not willing to listen to reason, and has made their support to Mr Singhs government conditional on his not proceeding further with the deal. The Left is aware that to stall the deal is to kill it, and this is what they want the prime minister to do. In other words, the Left wants the prime minister of India to go back on his word. If Mr Singh agrees to do this, he will not only demean himself, he will also lower the office he holds and bring indignity to India. To continue as prime minister under the terms laid down by the comrades is not a respectable and viable option. The alternative is to go to the people and seek a fresh verdict.

 There is, of course, a risk in going to the polls. An election is always a gamble, and even more so under the present circumstances when the old political certainties no longer hold. But that risk is better than the ignominy of running a government that has no mind of its own. The instability of elections is always preferable to the politics of blackmail. A few days ago, Mr Singh expressed himself with extraordinary firmness about the Left and its opposition to the treaty with the US. He should maintain that firmness. What is more, he should not procrastinate and allow the initiative to slip from his hands. As prime minister, he should decide when to call the elections. He should not allow the Left to put him in a corner. The time is now. The Left should be left behind.

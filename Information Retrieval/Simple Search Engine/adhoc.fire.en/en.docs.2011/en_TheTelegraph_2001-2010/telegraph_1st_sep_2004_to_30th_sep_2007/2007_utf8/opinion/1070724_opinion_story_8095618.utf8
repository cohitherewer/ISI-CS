The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 EVIL HOUR

 By absolving the sacked chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhary, of all charges and reinstating him, the supreme court of Pakistan has performed a role that would have befitted its political leaders. The court has taken Pakistan closer to democracy than it has ever been in the past few years. The immediate message the verdict sends across is that the judiciary in Pakistan has a mind that functions independently of that of its dictator, and is more than willing to exercise it. The workings of this restive mind have been fairly evident over the last few months during which lawyers, in a body, have resisted the Pakistan presidents attempt to make the judiciary cater to his own interests. The sharp reaction from the legal community to Pervez Musharrafs sacking of the chief justice on trumped-up charges of corruption eventually galvanized into a wider pro-democracy movement. It adopted Mr Chaudhary as its rallying figure and became more strident as Mr Musharraf resorted to use the ethnic Mohajir card to divide it. The ensuing bloodshed and the forcefulness of the public response have taught the president not to underestimate the strength of the movement that has him as its target. His timid reaction to the court judgment which he had once expected to vindicate his position as the upholder of truth shows his unwillingness to push things too hard when other truths have so alarmingly compromised his position as the supreme head of the country. 

 Mr Musharraf, for one, can hardly deny the truth about his flawed policy with regard to the jihadis, presently his chief scourge both within the country and along its blood-drenched borders. He was expected to rein them in, as part of his undertaking as the Wests prime ally in the war on terror. His moderation and signing of pacts with militants to keep the border areas in control while allowing for them to feed Pakistans terror industry in Kashmir have only served to further consolidate terrorist linkages throughout the entire region and create a severe internal security crisis for Pakistan (as the Lal Masjid siege proved). 

 Mr Musharraf now runs the risk of facing a major rebellion within the army and a wider conflagration across the country if he pushes forward with his policy against the Islamist radicals in the west. On the other hand, if he desists from doing it, he runs the risk of inviting Western aggression on Pakistani soil and worse, losing the support of the United States of America in his battle for political survival. The last may be more important for him at this crucial hour, when an aggressive judiciary seems hellbent on denying him a smooth transition to another term of dictatorship.

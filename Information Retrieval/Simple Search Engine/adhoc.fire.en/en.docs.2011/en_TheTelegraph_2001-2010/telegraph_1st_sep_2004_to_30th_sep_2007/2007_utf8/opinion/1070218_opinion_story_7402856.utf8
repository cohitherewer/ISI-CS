 Booming industry

 Sir In cricket, the betting industry in India is believed to be worth Rs 90,000 crore. That is more than the countrys defence budget! The government has failed to stop this industry from flourishing, as the recent revelations involving the West Indian cricketer, Marlon Samuels, have proved. With the World Cup only a few weeks away, betting can only pick up momentum. Cricket, which is now played round the year, is one of the biggest industries India can boast of. As such, it should get pride of place in the Union budget.

 Yours faithfully,

 M. Kumar, New Delhi

 In all fairness

 Sir The recommendations of the second administrative reforms commission, presented by its chairman, Veerappa Moily, to the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, are welcome (PM above Caesar and wife, Feb 13). Ministers and parliamentarians are often required to submit reports, which mostly say the expected things, or are shoddily prepared. Moily, however, seems to have done a thorough job. 

 The question now is about implementation. Experience shows that the recommendations of expert commissions, set up at high costs to the exchequer, are hardly ever implemented. It would be interesting to have a commission to investigate the total expenditure incurred on all expert-commissions set up till date, and compare it with the percentage of recommendations actually implemented. It would have been better if Moilys commission had invited suggestions from the public before finalizing its recommendations, with rewards or honour for the practicable ones.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir The suggestions of the six-member committee, headed by V. Moily, if implemented, would give this country one of most efficient governments in the world. However, one cannot be very hopeful of the outcome. Over the years, people in power in India have shown a gift for creating committees, but nothing much has changed on the ground. It remains to be seen if, after spending so much of the tax-payers money on these committees, anything improves at all.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir If, as the Administrative Reforms Commision feels, Caesars action should also be put under the scanner, then what is the point of leaving the prime minister out of the monitors ambit? Who, if not the prime minister, is the counterpart of Caesar in the Indian democracy?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Datta, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir Are the policymakers aware that the flourishing Indian economy is just a myth, because women and children have mostly remained unaffected by it (Growth, minus women amp; kids Feb 14)? The statistics on anaemia and malnutrition throw up a grim picture. The alarming rise in healthcare problems goes on to show how the much-hyped national health policies have failed to leave any significant impact on a large section of the society. 

 The crisis has been deepened by the steady rise in population and the number of people living under the poverty-line. Consequently, the there has been a rise in the number of under-nourished mothers and sick children. With so many failures looming all over the country, painting a rosy picture of todays India by economists and policymakers is likely to mislead the public. The concept of gender budgeting, which many women activists have been campaigning for, could, in theory, be a novel solution. It remains to be seen, however, if such a project ever gets implemented in the near future. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

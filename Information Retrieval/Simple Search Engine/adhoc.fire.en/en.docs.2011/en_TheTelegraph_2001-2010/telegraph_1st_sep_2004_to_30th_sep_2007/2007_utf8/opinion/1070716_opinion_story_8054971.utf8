The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Darkness falls

 Sir The report, Rain legacy; power crisis, (July 12), does not provide a convincing explanation of the incessant power cuts in West Bengal. It is not wet coal that is the problem, but the lack of proper maintenance. The excuse sought in wet coal, and repeated every year, is in fact tiring. The Power Development Corporation should know that even freshly-mined coal has a high percentage of moisture. Officials should instead inspect the proportion of fine particles in the coal meant for use. A high percentage of these particles could be the reason why the plants were unable to use the coal. Anyway, greater attention should be paid to the loading of coal by the authorities concerned. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta,

 Sir West Bengal seems to have returned to the dark days of the Eighties a time when nothing worked in the state, thanks to the militant trade unionism of the labour wings of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the regressive policies of the Left Front government. In a throwback to the days when Jyoti Basu was mocked as Andhar Basu, Calcuttas evenings are once more witness to children studying by kerosene lamps and candle light. The power crisis has become so acute that the explanation of wet coal alone causing shortfalls does not hold water. Somebody, somewhere, is lying as usual. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees resurgent Bengal seems to be negotiating its way through complete darkness. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Days after the massive downpour, Calcutta is still struggling to recover from its effects. Even the power cuts are being blamed on the rains. But the fault is not with the monsoon clouds. I grew up hearing things like electricity saved is electricity produced. But somehow this basic concept does not seem to be clear to those who are in charge of switching off the street lights. Everyday, I see street lights turned on even after daybreak. This is sheer wastage of electricity for which tax-payers have to shell out money. Last year, I took up the matter with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation but I was told that the lights are maintained by three different agencies the municipal corporation, the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the Calcutta Improvement Trust. Everyone is happy passing the buck. The time has come for citizens to do something concrete about this irresponsible act. I am thinking of taking legal action against all the agencies concerned. All who are pained by this can get in touch with me (Wasif Manzil, 8/1A, Talbagan Lane, Park Circus, Calcutta 17) so that we can collectively act against the errant employees. Only greater accountability will compel them to work responsibly. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Shahanshah Mirza,

 Sir The unit of power Mega-Watt is written as mw in The Telegraph. The correct abbreviation is MW, in capital letters. According to the guidelines of the International System of Units, symbols named after scientists, such as James Watt, Andr-Marie Ampre, Charles Augustin de Coulomb, should be in the upper case. On the other hand, M stands for mega while m signifies milli. These notations are universally accepted. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Damage control

 Sir The London and Glasgow incidents have had a damaging impact on business process outsourcing in India (Britain fallout on BPO deals, July 10). The British police are yet to establish whether the arrested Indians masterminded or acted as tools in the hands of the real terrorists. In any case, the involvement of a few members of the Indian Muslim community in terrorism should not put all Indians and all Indian institutions under the scanner. Since fundamentalism is a problem in many countries, it would be unfair to penalize India alone. The companies concerned, Indian police and the Interpol, can verify the identities of BPO employees and ensure that suspect elements are kept out of the industry. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 S.P. Ghosal, 

 Calcutta

 Sir The prime minister has to assume responsibility for the terror attacks in the United Kingdom and admit that India is now a hub of terrorism, and not just its victim. Manmohan Singh should also take initiative to counter the negative publicity India is getting abroad and ensure that Indias economic interests are not hurt. The United Progressive Alliance, in its desperate attempt to bag votes, continues to fail miserably on the security front. If the government does not act fast, the future might get even more grim for India.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Subodh K. Banerjee, 

 New Delhi

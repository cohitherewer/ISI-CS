 GRIMY SHADES OF GREEN

 It took a book fair and a cricket match to expose the double standards in Calcuttas attitude to the environment, writes Sreyashi Dastidar

 Clear off the Maidan

 Its called the law of conservation of carnivals. If one gets derailed, theres always another to take its place. The book fair was all set to begin by the end of last month, till the Calcutta high court decided to act firm and order the fair to pack off from the Maidan. On the other hand, a one-day international match was not even a remote possibility on Calcuttas spring calendar, till the Board of Control for Cricket in India decided to reward the Cricket Association of Bengal for getting rid of a certain Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

 A lot has happened around the two events over the last month or so, bringing into question the use of the term, carnival, as an occasion for happiness and celebration. But the circumstances separate, but sometimes with ironic links which have led to the banishing of the book fair from the Maidan and the gifting of the cricket match to Eden Gardens are far from happy. In fact, they tell of a state of affairs in which illegal operations, lies, double standards and a general disregard for transparency have come together to present a picture of a world gone wrong. Incidentally, carnival also implies festivities where excesses are not only condoned, but even facilitated.

 The issue which uprooted the 32nd Calcutta Book Fair from its familiar venue of the Park Street Maidan was environment. The question of the care and protection of the Maidan mainland Calcuttas only significant green patch has been worrying environmentally aware citizens for some time. Going by the citys appalling ignorance and callousness about its natural treasures, it has to be said that the environmentally aware Calcuttan is a bit of an oxymoron. That could explain why many citizens, book-loving and otherwise, were surprised at all the activism against the book fair on the Maidan.

 The issue was simple enough. The book fair took over the Maidan for over two weeks taking into account the days required for assembling and dismantling the temporary structures. At the end of it, as well as during the fair, the greens would be a wreck. According to the impact report prepared by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board in 2001 (now impossible to find on the internet), the environmental cost of the book fair was far greater than the profits of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild could cover. The high court merely took cognizance of this damage, and its work was made simpler by the evidence that the guild had provided incorrect information and misled the court.

 Things would not have come to such a sticky pass had the organizers of the book fair kept their word of shifting the venue of the fair after 2006. The situation could still have been salvaged if the West Bengal chief minister had not decided that this was his moment to show his love for books. What was strictly an issue of environmental damage soon turned into a political battle of wills. A range of double standards was put on display. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee who should have known better than to defend the wrongdoings of a group of publishers proclaimed to the world that the book fair, and not any other fair, should be allowed to continue on the Maidan. Clearly, for Bhattacharjee, the damage to the Maidan is negligible compared to the losses suffered by the publishers if the fair, held anywhere other than the Maidan, draws fewer visitors. Neither Bhattacharjee, nor the guild who never fail to remind us of the citys love for the printed word is willing to accept that a true lover of books would visit the fair on or away from the Maidan; and those who wouldnt are probably not so fond of books, after all.

 It would be wrong to think, however, that the double standards on the Maidan have been laid to rest with the high courts verdict. There is perhaps a law of conservation of double standards as well. The India-Sri Lanka tie at the Eden Gardens has proved to be the perfect opportunity for the different-rules-for-different-people policy to come into play again. Come any big match at the Eden, a large chunk of the Maidan is turned into a parking lot. Cars of all makes and sizes drive into the Maidan, emitting smoke and squashing vegetation under their wheels, while many of their drivers use the greens as their spittoon and lavatory. How is the same Maidan, which is damaged by the activities of the book fair, left unspoilt by hundreds of cars driving and parking on it?

 Forty-eight hours before the match, the CAB chief, Prasun Mukherjee who also happens to be the police commissioner of Calcutta announced that the parking areas would be as usual and that shifting them away from the Maidan had never been a consideration. Perhaps he stopped short of saying that using a part of the Maidan to park cars just for a day is hardly the same as holding a book fair on it. Most of Calcutta and the CAB chief must be included in this group is yet to realize that environmental damage is a cumulative process, in which each act of violation adds up to produce long-term damage. Once a precedent has been set, it should have been easy to stop further injury to the Maidan, whether it is for a profit-raking cricket match or the Republic Day parade.

 Cricket, like books, is among Calcuttas great passions, or so we are told. But exactly how much licence is it possible to take citing the excuse of passion? The last time Sri Lanka played India at the Eden Gardens, the crowd had pelted stones and water bottles at the Sri Lankan cricketers, leading to the abandonment of a World Cup semi-final match. Was that passion for cricket? With each book fair, the queues out side the food stalls seem to get longer than those outside the bookstalls. Is that passion for books? And what kind of passion does it speak of when we sit and watch the Maidan being repeatedly ravaged on one pretext or another?

 Just when it appeared that the Maidan was worth a few peoples concern, the concerned citizens showed a surprising nonchalance to the new menace on the Maidan. The chief minister loves both books and cricket. So it is not surprising that he fails to see any harm coming upon the Maidan as a result of the book fair or a cricket match. But what are the environmental crusaders thinking? Are they busy looking for match tickets? Did some people feel more motivated in taking on the Publishers and Booksellers Guild than they would in confronting the cricket establishment? It has been reported that a team of environmental experts has examined the area on which the book-fair authorities had started erecting the stalls. Will the team also visit the Maidan tomorrow to gauge the extent of damage caused by cars and cricket-lovers?

 Those who remember the urgency with which the court was moved to make the book fair shift out of the Maidan have reason to be surprised to see that activism disappear soon after. A few leaders from the opposition parties were seen openly siding with the environmental lobby on the book-fair issue no doubt, the chief ministers proximity to the guild had given them an added incentive. Given that the new CAB chief was Bhattacharjees favoured candidate for ousting Dalmiya, the opposition leaders would have been expected to seize the opportunity and march to the courts this time as well. Perhaps they love cricket more than books?

 Above all, what has the state pollution control board been doing? After being called reckless by the high court in the book fair ruling, this was the boards chance to show that it is doing its job. But then, a pollution control board that takes its job seriously would have made Calcutta a different city. The Maidan, it seems, is left to fend for itself in a city sold to its carnivals and double standards.

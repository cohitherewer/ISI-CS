The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MARKET FEVER

 Is last weeks stock-market crash a precursor of worse things to come? Opinion is divided on the question. Some people think that the recent volatility is a bump in the long road of the countrys growth story; the more optimistic expect the markets to rebound sooner rather than later. There seems to be agreement that the causes of the roller-coaster behaviour of the market lie in the global markets. The combination of the tightening of global liquidity (through coordinated action by central banks of many developed countries) and the cumulative effect of the near-collapse of lending institutions in the American sub-prime mortgage markets is considered to be the principal factor that caused the stock-market collapse the world over. Sub-prime mortgage markets are named thus because borrowers in them pay substantially higher than prime interest rates, have poor credit histories, and are the most likely to default on their home loans. In the United States of America, academics, economists and money managers are sounding the alarm. Financial markets in that country are hoping that the Federal Reserve will drop interest rates, but officials at both the central bank and the treasury department have insisted that the markets discipline themselves. News reports indicate that there has already been an effect on the most visible part of the global market: mergers and acquisitions through leveraged buyouts. About $60 billion worth of deals have been pulled back. There was not a single deal pulled in all of 2006. In India, a high-profile initial public offering was forced to re-price its shares at a lower level.

 While a stock-market crash is not the first thing that comes to mind when we think of financial crises, the economist, Hyman Minsky, certainly thought so. Proposing his theory of financial fragility, Mr Minsky wrote in 1974, A fundamental characteristic of our economy is that the financial system swings between robustness and fragility and these swings are an integral part of the process that generates business cycles. That said, remember that Mr Minsky was referring to a closed capitalist economy, not an open global one. The signs from the global outlook are less dire. First, corporations are flush with money, from both profits and capital raised for expansion. A lot of that cash is in highly liquid assets. The banking system is well-capitalized, both globally, and in India. Money supply growth rates are strong, not just in India, but also globally. Which means that despite the recent tightening, global liquidity is still abundant. The perception of risk appears to have changed. But the capacity to assume that risk has not.

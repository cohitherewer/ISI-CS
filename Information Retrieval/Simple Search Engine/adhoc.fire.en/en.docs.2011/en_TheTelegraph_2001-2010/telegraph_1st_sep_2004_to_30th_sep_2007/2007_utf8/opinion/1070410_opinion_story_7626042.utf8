The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 YOUNG ONES

 All good ideas outlive their authors. Greg Chappell is no longer the coach of the Indian cricket team, but some of the ideas he propagated when he was the coach are unlikely to be abandoned by his successor. One of the ideas that Chappell advanced was that younger players need to be encouraged. He argued that by encouraging younger talents, a wider pool would be created for the selection process. Implicit in this idea was a project to take Indian cricket away from a dependence on a handful of stars whose talents, because of their age, were fading. During Chappells tenure as coach, this idea and the project did not win too many supporters. But after his departure, there is a recognition that along Chappells path lies the future of Indian cricket. Within a few days of Chappells resignation, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has announced that the national selectors have been directed to send a young team to Bangladesh. This is a step in the right direction, and with some luck, the decision will not be reversed after the triumph of Bangladesh over South Africa.

 A couple of defeats is a small sacrifice in the process of building a team. Despite its recent run of success, the Bangladesh cricket team is inferior to the Indian one. A tour of Bangladesh is thus the perfect occasion to seed new and talented players. It is also the occasion to give the senior players a rest and an opportunity to recuperate. If the BCCI can prevail over the selectors to put an emphasis on younger talents for the tour to Bangladesh, a new chapter will open for Indian cricket. More than anything else, Indian cricket needs a change of attitude. A new attitude must look towards the future and make performance the only criterion for selection. Chappell tried and apparently failed. But his failure is no reason to reject his ideas. Indian crickets future lies in upholding the Chappell doctrine.

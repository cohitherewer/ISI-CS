 HAND ON HEART

 Where would Shilpa Shetty have been today if Tony Blair had not happened? Hounded by white, working-class cele-Brits, canonized by Keith Vazs tikka-masala set, and her London social life now in a whirl after being apologized to by the prime minister himself, Shetty is a symbol of the Bollywooded multiculturalism that is such an important part of Mr Blairs relaxed, new Britain. This essentially Blairite opening up of English decency began perhaps in 1997, with Mr Blair mourning the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, by calling her the peoples princess. Since this early success with the people, the smiling prime ministerial countenance with its marked slackening of the proverbially stiff, national upper lip has also got on the peoples nerves in a way that may prove to be more enduring than the popularity. Mr Blair will hand over his seals of office to the Queen on June 27, a little more than ten years after he took them on. The British are special, he declared in his valedictory speech last week. It is a sentence unimaginable from any other British prime minister, least of all from Margaret Thatcher. And that distressingly un-British use of special signals the direction in which Mr Blair has been taking his country over the last few years.

 Mr Blairs special is close, in many ways, to Mr Bushs Yo, Blair! though still a few notches above the latters bluff high-handedness. The dismaying implications of the presidents informality vis--vis Britains relationship with its oldest ally, the United States of America might well be what Mr Blairs prime ministership will be remembered for in history. Iraq is still burning, and British troops still living out the aftermath of a terrible decision. But what Mr Blairs handling of the matter of going to war seems to have compromised most profoundly is the role of the people, and their opinion, in a modern democracy. 

 Hand on heart, he said in his farewell speech, I did what I thought was right. It is that second I that puts Mr Blair in the bleakest light to have fallen on him since the twin towers fell on September 11, 2001. If he did so, as he says, out of belief, then that places him between mendacity and gullibility, neither of which is an enviable trait in a prime minister. After all those non-existent weapons of mass destruction, sexed-up reports, hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths and a chilling suicide, one is left with a choice between honourable stupidity and monumental dishonesty. Is it Mr Blairs good fortune that most have gone for the former? After all, there is peace, at last, in Northern Ireland, and a minimum common wage in the country; the Bank of England is independent, and homosexuals can become civil partners. That is all very nice indeed.

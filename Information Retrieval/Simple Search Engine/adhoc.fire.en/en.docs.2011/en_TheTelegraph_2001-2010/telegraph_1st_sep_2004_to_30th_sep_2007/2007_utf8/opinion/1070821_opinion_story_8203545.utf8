 Victory nonetheless

 Sir Although the Indian cricket team has wrapped up the three-Test series against England 1-0, no cricket enthusiast in India is happy with the way the victory has come. In the first Test at Lords, but for the benevolence of the rain gods (and Mahendra Singh Dhonis spirited knock), India could not have saved the match. The victory at Nottingham brought some good cheer. But again, at the Oval, in spite of gaining a defendable lead of 319 runs, the Indian captain and his advisors refused to ask England to follow on. 

 Were Rahul Dravid and his men scared of batting in the fourth innings, given that the pitch could take an unpredictable turn in the late stages of the Test? But then, how can one excuse such low self-confidence in a team that decided to play seven batsmen? By not enforcing the follow-on, India gifted away the psychological advantage to the English, and even invited anxious moments, especially when they were teetering at 11 for 3. 

 One only has to think of the approach of Ricky Pontings men in the Ashes series last year. Even after ensuring a series win by 3-0, the Australians never relaxed their control and went on to win the remaining two Tests by handsome margins. That is called a professional approach, which the Indian team is yet to cultivate.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Indias series win against England in England, coming after 21 years, will surely act as moral booster for the youngsters in the team who performed on a par with their more illustrious seniors. Anil Kumble, with his maiden ton, will have plenty of reasons to savour his last Test series in England. 

 A lot has been made of Team Indias decision not to enforce a follow-on on England and lose the chance to clinch a 2-0 series win. Rahul Dravids explanation that Indian bowlers were tired (but the England innings ended within 22 minutes on the fourth morning!) has to be taken with more than a pinch of salt. The real problem was the lack of a positive approach. In the second innings, M.S. Dhoni should have been sent one-down, and Dravid should have batted less defensively. Indians will do well to remember that England was without their main pace trio of Andrew Flintoff, Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison. 

 With around 40 per cent of the Test squad being replaced, the one-day team should display a more positive approach and win the series for the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It was sheer gutlessness on the part of Rahul Dravid to not enforce the follow-on on the English team and let them off the hook in the Oval test. What should and would have been a four-day innings victory for India ended in a stale, five-day draw. The English side will now go into the forthcoming one-day internationals with renewed vigour after clinching a draw from the jaws of defeat. Dravid also failed miserably with the bat, scoring a paltry 12 runs over no less than 96 deliveries, when a quicker run rate was called for. In 1999-2000, Sachin Tendulkar had made a similar error in judgment and not enforced the follow-on against New Zealand in Ahmedabad. Needless to say, India lost the opportunity to win the match. Dravid should be enrolled in a B-school crash course on leadership.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Rahul Dravid has let go of a golden opportunity of winning the Test series against England 2-0. Not only did he turn the team away from victory, but at the close of day four, he even led India to a position of possible defeat. One almost wishes that some physical indisposition stopped him from leading India to another ignominious failure in the one-day series.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir There has been no dearth of incidents in the India-England Test series, but what stood out in the middle of all of them was the abysmal quality of umpiring. A very bad decision was handed out to Sourav Ganguly by umpire Ian Howell in the first innings of the third Test. The ball had clearly deflected to Gangulys pad, after striking the inner edge of his bat. Why does one feel that some umpires have developed a certain prejudice against a few Indian players, such as Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar? The umpires look visibly edgy when an Indian batsman nears a century. To stop such suspicions from surfacing, a simple rule can be brought in. All lbw decisons should henceforth be referred to the third umpire, who can make use of the advances of television technology. Umpires should also be penalized for gross errors, just as players are. Or one team will feel that they are up against 13 men.

 Yours faithfully,

Manoj Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir Why is so much fuss being made about Rahul Dravids decision to bat a second time, rather than asking England to follow on? Why dont his critics acknowledge that the second Test was not won by fluke that too against a team which has not lost on home soil in the last six years. Also, after several years, we played like a team, with contributions from every individual be it Dinesh Karthik with his sensible batting, or Zaheer Khan with 18 wickets, or Yuvraj Singh with his pinch-hitting. 

 It is time to reflect on the positive aspects of the tour rather than rue the draw at the Oval. If the team keeps up its present form, it can even defeat Australia, both at home and abroad. But before that, it is important to bag the one-day series, if only to shut the critics up.

 Yours faithfully,

Moinak Basu, Raniganj

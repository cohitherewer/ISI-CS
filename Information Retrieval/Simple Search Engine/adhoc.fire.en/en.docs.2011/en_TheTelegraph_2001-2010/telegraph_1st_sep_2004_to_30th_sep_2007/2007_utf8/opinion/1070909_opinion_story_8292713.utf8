The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 If Kitne aadmi thhe? is the question, what would Ram Gopal Varmas answer be? Ek. One. And no, we are not talking of the number of people in the theatres where Ram Gopal Varma ki Aag is showing. Ek is for the one man who has singlehandedly saved the film from disaster in Gwalior. His name is VK Raghuvanshi, and he is the fort-towns superintendent of police. Raghuvanshi has recently ordered theatre-owners to stop people from leaving the theatre midway through a film. The official order asks hall-owners to take down the details of all persons leaving a film midway in short, PLFM though this is only a security measure thought up after the Hyderabad bomb blasts. But for poor Pushpendra Singh Tomar, Mahesh Shivhare and many like them, it meant having to sit through Ramujis Aag. They tried bribing the watchman, but even that ancient Indian method failed. Last heard, the PLFM of Gwalior were planning to form an association and seek a review of Raghuvanshis order. Shouldnt Ramu be doing something too? Casting Raghuvanshi in the role of an upright police officer in his next film, perhaps?

 And did you know that the idea of Chak De! India was conceived within the four walls of the prime ministers office? It so happened that representatives of Yashraj Films were calling on Prithviraj Chavan at the PMO. Chavan, incidentally, was handling the sports portfolio after the sudden demise of Sunil Dutt. The conversation inevitably turned to sports and films, and Chavan is known to have suggested a film based on sports, preferably a national sport like hockey, which had fallen on bad times. The idea was very well received, as the film proves. Of course, the PMO did its bit by offering the national stadium and other facilities when the film was finally being shot.

 People are in a mood to form associations, it seems. The latest to join the bandwagon are armymen, and high-ranking ones too. Recent postings and appointments in the higher ranks have been so unsatisfactory that four senior officers three major-generals and a naval commander have joined hands to set up a forum named, rather literally, Senior officers seeking justice in armed forces. More are expected to join in a short while.

 Lalu Prasad is preferring the company of non-politicians these days. He was at a popular musical talent hunt on TV recently. The other day in Rail Bhavan, New Delhi, he was found in the company of wrestlers from all over India, at the release of a book on wrestling. The scribes were thrilled at the idea. So Laluji was asked if he, like Mulayam Singh Yadav, had frequented any akhara in his youth. The rustic rail-mantri replied that even without an akhara training, he knew a few tricks, particularly on how to pin his opponent so that he does not get a chance to get up, let alone get even with him. A wily journo wondered aloud why Lalu Prasad forgot to use this trick in the last elections against Nitish Kumar. Pat came the reply: That is why I am with you here today, to pick up new tricks and win the lost battle.

 For the sangh parivar, family will remain the perpetual problem, that is when it is not besieged by sleaze on CDs. At a recent dinner meet hosted in honour of the BJP president, Rajnath Singh, party MPs of Rajasthan complained to Singh about a senior members obsession with his wife. Apparently, the party leader nominated to the state executive anyone who helped organize a dance programme for his wife, an Odissi dancer. Rajnaths response on this matter has not been heard. One cannot but sympathize with him in his troubles with ambitious bahus and their henpecked husbands.

 Looking at icons as normal human beings with weaknesses and flaws is catching on. First, it was Gandhi as an inadequate father in the film, Gandhi My Father. And now, a documentary film-maker has made a film on Rabindranath Tagores much-speculated-upon relationship with his sister-in-law, Kadambari Debi.

 In India a kiss is synonymous with sensation. This kiss was sensational too, but only because it involved a near-impossible breach of Z-category security. The kisser: a woman from Rajamundhry, Andhra Pradesh. The kissed: Sonia Gandhi.

 FOOTNOTE

 Politics is an enriching experience, and the person living out this dictum is none other than the information and broadcasting minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. When Priyada is not shooting his mouth, he is, usually, collecting books. Das Munshis new hobby is to get together the literary works of Nobel-Prize winners, starting from the time the award was first given out. In case there is any one outstanding book that has attracted the most attention, Priya goes looking out for the one. When there is a body of such distinguished works, which is usually the case, the best known books of the author fill up his shelves. Having almost completed his collection of Nobel-winning literary works, Priya is supposed to have started collecting winning contributions in economics. Since some of these are not available in India, they are procured from abroad. It goes without saying that the one who will reap the most benefit from this acquired habit of the minister is Das Munshis son.

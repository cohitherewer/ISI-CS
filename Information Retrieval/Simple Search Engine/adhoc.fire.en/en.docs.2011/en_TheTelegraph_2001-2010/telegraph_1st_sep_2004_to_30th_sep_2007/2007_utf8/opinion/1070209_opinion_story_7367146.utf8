The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ROAD TO DEATH

 It is difficult to determine which act is more reprehensible the lynching of a policeman by a mob in a village near Haldia, or the indirect endorsement of the crime by Bengals opposition politicians. There is no doubt that the tragedy is a fallout of the irresponsible and cynical politics that has rocked the state over the past few weeks. It is shameful that, instead of condemning the mob violence, Ms Mamata Banerjee actually hailed the people who had dug up the roads leading to their village. It would be simplistic to assume that Ms Banerjee is not aware of her agitations potential for violence. On the contrary, she sees in the escalating violence both a justification of and victory for her brand of politics. How costly this politics can be was seen during the days of the Naxalite violence in Bengal. Those were the darkest days for Bengals politics and economy. The atmosphere of terror and gloom that enveloped the state during those violent days not only crippled its economy but also drove away its brightest minds to other places. The void that the Naxalite anarchy created has not been filled even today. The violent methods of Ms Banerjees current agitation revive the nightmares of that infantile rebellion. 

 Even more disastrous is the way she has reduced an important debate about economic development to a matter of street politics. It is perfectly legitimate for any political party or group to differ with Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees ideas about the industrialization of Bengal. Several other opposition groups and even some partners of the ruling Left Front resent some of the steps that the government had taken in order to attract more investments to Bengal. But Ms Banerjee and some of her fellow-travellers seem to have their own agenda for opposing the industrialization moves. Smarting from her humiliating defeat in the last assembly elections, she has seized the issue in order to try and return to the centrestage of Bengals politics. She has, therefore, reduced the economic argument to a battle against the ruling Marxists and against the chief minister. And she has decided that nothing is wrong in her political war. Whether at Singur or Nandigram, she would like all new projects to be stopped before she would even respond to Mr Bhattacharjees offer for dialogue. Bengal will be a loser again if this politics of blackmail is allowed to win.

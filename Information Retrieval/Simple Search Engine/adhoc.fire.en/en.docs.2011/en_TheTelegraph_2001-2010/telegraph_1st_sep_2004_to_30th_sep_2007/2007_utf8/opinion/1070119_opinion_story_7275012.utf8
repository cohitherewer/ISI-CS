 LOOKING AHEAD

 The recent visit of the external affairs minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, to Islamabad suggests that relations between India and Pakistan are moving forward, slowly but steadily. Although no major agreement or understanding was reached during the visit, substantive business was transacted. Not surprisingly, the foreign secretary, Mr Shiv Shankar Menon, who was accompanying Mr Mukherjee, described the visit as very constructive and forward looking. This is more than diplomatic nicety. The ostensible reason for the visit of the minister was to extend an invitation to the leadership in Pakistan for the summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation that India will host in April, 2007. 

 It is clear now that the Pakistan prime minister, Mr Shaukat Aziz, rather than the president, Mr Pervez Musharraf, will attend the summit. The Pakistan president obviously wants to host the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, in Pakistan before he visits India again. But there were three significant reasons for both India and Pakistan to take comfort from Mr Mukherjees visit. First, an atmosphere of bonhomie and cordiality prevailed during the visit. Mr Mukherjee even had time to visit Taxila and interact with representatives of various political parties in Pakistan. Second, India and Pakistan seem to now have identified clear markers on the road to peace and stability. The fourth round of the composite dialogue will take place on March 14 in New Delhi, and the first meeting of the joint mechanism on terrorism will also take place before the end of March. The Pakistan foreign minister, Mr Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, will travel to India in February for the meeting of the joint India-Pakistan commission and a number of agreements will be signed during the visit. These would include agreements on reducing the risk of nuclear accidents, on the speedy return of inadvertent border crossings and on incidents at sea. An understanding to ease restrictions on the movements of each others diplomats, and facilitate visits to Noida and Gurgaon for Pakistani diplomats in New Delhi, and to Taxila for Indian diplomats will also be firmed up. 

 Finally, there seems to have been progress on critical bilateral issues too, and while little was disclosed publicly, there is room for optimism. On the Sir Creek issue, a joint survey is being undertaken so that an amicable solution could be found. On Siachen, India and Pakistan seem close to arriving at a solution. Even on Jammu and Kashmir, back channels have contributed a great deal to closing the gap between the positions of the two states. The year, 2007, could be very significant for relations between India and Pakistan, provided Messrs Singh and Musharraf sustain the political will that has enabled them to move bilateral ties to almost the point of stability.

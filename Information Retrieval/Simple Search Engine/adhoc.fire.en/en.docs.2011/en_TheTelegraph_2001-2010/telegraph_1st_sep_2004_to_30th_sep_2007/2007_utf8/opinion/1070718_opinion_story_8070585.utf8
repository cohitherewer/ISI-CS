 DODGY WISDOM

 It is silly and irresponsible of a Central minister to lecture adult citizens on sexual trust. Breaking the silences in talking about sex is certainly an important part of dealing with HIV/AIDS. But what is actually said, especially in public by political leaders, once that silence is sounded is quite as important. Renuka Chowdhury, the women and child development minister, should be careful not to turn her messages on condom-use into moral-science lectures, however jocularly delivered and titteringly received. Addressing the womens forum of an organization for people living with HIV/AIDS, Ms Chowdhury made the apparently amusing point that women should take the initiative in condom-use because men cannot be trusted in matters of sexual fidelity. This bit of common sense came with its ready-made scenario: they come staggering home while drunk. And immediately one is supposed to think of sex-workers, truck drivers and migrant labourers.

 The peddling of morality garbed in stereotypes is not the governments business. Women must be informed, with vagueness or coyness, about sexual health, and condom-use is crucial in that. The point behind their being encouraged to buy and keep condoms with them, instead of relying solely on their male sexual partners, is not to instil suspicion or panic, but to make sure they have more control over their sexual lives and health. The concrete thing to do here is to provide information, and ensure that good-quality condoms are more easily and cheaply available, and that they are sold in spaces in which women do not feel inhibited or embarrassed. Besides, no element of the prevention campaign must, in any way, create fear and prejudice in the minds of men and women. To talk about trust, however facetiously, is to risk precisely that, and on premises that are entirely anecdotal and unscientific. Sexual attitudes and behaviour are complex aspects of adult private life, and the States interventions in them have to be conducted with the utmost delicacy and sensibleness. In the case of HIV/AIDS this is doubly difficult: programmes have to address the unmentionables without being unduly intrusive or judgmental. Ms Chowdhury would do well to stick to proven facts and not try to entertain her audience with dodgy generalizations passing themselves off as wisdom.

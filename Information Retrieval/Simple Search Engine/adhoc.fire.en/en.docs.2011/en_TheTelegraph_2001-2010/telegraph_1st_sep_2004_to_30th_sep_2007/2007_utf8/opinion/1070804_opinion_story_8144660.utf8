 PALE REFLECTIONS 

 Soumitra Das

 Visual Arts

 The Power of Three exhibition 

 (till August 6) at Gallery K2 was disappointing after the 

 dazzling show of tapestry, inspired by Raza, held here for 

 its inauguration. The exhibition features three artists 

 Kashmiri Khosa, Amal Ghosh and Nabanita Javed and the 

 works on display are perhaps not their best efforts. Khosas 

 paintings, in spite of the artists yen for the Vedanta 

 and other philosophical texts, are puerile and wishy-washy. 

 His astral bodies, with electric sparks around them, look 

 like illustrations from a manual on holding a seance. 

 Amal Ghosh uses watercolour to 

 excellent effect (picture), and although he has not exhibited 

 his work on enamel here, they are impressive too. But the 

 distortion of figures in his current works seems half-hearted 

 and undecided. It is as if the figures cannot decide which 

 part of the world they belong to. Even if Ghosh were trying 

 to communicate this indecision in the context of globalization, 

 this is not stated strongly enough. 

 Nabanita Javed is a successful 

 gynaecologist. Her current series of large paintings, with 

 strips of colour stretched across the canvas, shows she 

 needs a lot more practice before she decides to hold an 

 exhibition. One can pardon slapdash paintwork by an amateur, 

 but not when somebody, who thinks she is good enough an 

 artist to show off her work, is responsible for it. The 

 works are pale imitations of one of Indias brightest young 

 stars.

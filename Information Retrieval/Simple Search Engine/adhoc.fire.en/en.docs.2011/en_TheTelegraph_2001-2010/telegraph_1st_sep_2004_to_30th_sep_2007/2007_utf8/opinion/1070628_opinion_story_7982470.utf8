 MAKING WAY FOR THE NEW

 CHINA DIARY - Neha Sahay

 As more and more foreigners come to work in China, the small section of English-speaking Chinese who interact with them everyday and is not thoroughly in awe of them is getting increasingly tired of their habits. Perhaps those most at edge are the Chinese working in international schools in small cities, where professionalism seems not to be the norm. 

 Most Chinese who chose to work in international schools do so not just for higher salaries but more for the non-competitive ambience, the freedom to teach creatively and the quality of textbooks. They willingly stay after hours to help in the administration. Then as schools expand, they find themselves cast aside after years of being regarded as the pillars of the school. 

 Teachers who ran around to get licences to start international schools in small cities a decade ago find themselves left out of the school hierarchy. In dealings with the authorities, be it permission to buy a new plot or levelling a playground, they are indispensable, not only as interpreters but also as negotiators, getting the work done without bribes and then supervising it. Yet, it is the Western johnnies-come-lately who are appointed as joint directors or heads of departments of schools. The same teacher who was found good enough to teach English for years suddenly finds herself superceded by a native English-speaker whose skin colour is just right. 

 Asians make the best students, Chinese teachers in international schools often say, because Asian parents share the same (old-fashioned) views on education. To their shock, they find that Chinese parents who have lived in the West and have returned to China on temporary assignments, or who have married Westerners are proving to be even pickier than Western parents, especially when the teaching of Chinese is concerned.

 Crumbling pillars

 These American-Chinese parents want Chinese-teaching to be fun with glossy texts and computer games. They find the repeated writing of Chinese characters unnecessary. More, they want Chinese to be taught in Pinyin, that is, Chinese written in the Roman script. But, ask the purists, can a language be learnt without its script or without the tedium of writing new characters repeatedly? Pinyin, they point out, is not Chinese. 

 Most international schools charge the earth in foreign currency, but are hesitant to hire the required number of teachers because native English-speaking teachers are a pricey lot. Hence it often happens that the same teacher conducts classes for three different grades in the same classroom simultaneously. The prospect of supervising a room full of pesky kids, some of whom are busy playing Chinese language games on their computers, is one most teachers baulk at. 

 But American-Chinese parents are pushy, and know exactly how to deal with uncooperative teachers. More than willing to meet them halfway, are the new young Chinese teachers. Having bagged a job in an international school, which allows them to interact with well-heeled foreigners everyday, these new-comers are all for dumping the old and embracing the new. Soon, the old pillars find themselves ignored even in matters concerning the teaching of their own language. The school director, not answerable to the management regarding the teaching of Chinese, finds it more pleasant to attend curriculum meetings with pretty young things. 

 Dealing with Western kids is another sensitive issue. Homework is such a bore when a new country is waiting to be explored. Then there are Western sensibilities to be taken care of. Teachers are under strict instructions not to chance diapers even if they are soiled so as not to frighten the child; not to insist on meals being eaten at a fixed time and place, so as not to curb the childs natural exuberance. Lessons for India here?

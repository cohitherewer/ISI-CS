 INNER COLOURS

 Somak Ghoshal

 Visual Arts

 Kanchanmala Ghoshs Blue (Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, Aug 14-19) included a series of portraits, some on strikingly large canvases, in acrylic and charcoal. Ghosh did not depart significantly from her signature style, choosing to focus on details of human faces and bodies. Her vision remains starkly realistic, but distinguished by playful experiments with perspective. 

 Some of the figures are studied from a distance, against vaguely defined backgrounds. Only the skilful manoeuvring of light and dark shades, in The Boy in Blue for instance (picture), suggests an enclosed space. In her daring moments, Ghosh pans on the faces confidently. She captures a range of nuances in a pair of luminous, though inward-looking, eyes or in the inscrutable turn of a lip.

 The series is held together by the predominant use of Paynes grey, which lends the particular blue-grey tinge to the works. This colour is used like a visual language that conveys a range of emotions bleakness, nostalgia and melancholy. It is also allowed to run down in tall drips, as if a film of illusion keeps melting away from these faces. The effect on the whole is hypnotic, burdening the viewers eyes with the weight of silence. A tiny red or orange goldfish appears in some of the paintings, floating around like thought-bubbles. Otherwise, such an obsessive use of blue would have been overbearing.

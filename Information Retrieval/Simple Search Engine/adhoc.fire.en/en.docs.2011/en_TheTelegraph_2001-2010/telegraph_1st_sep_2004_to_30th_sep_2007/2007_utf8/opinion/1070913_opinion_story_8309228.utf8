 TURNING AWAY FROM TERROR

 AFTER SHOCK

 Neither bin Laden nor America seems to be getting any more popular, says Tom Baldwin

 Muslims increasingly reject Osama bin Laden and oppose suicide bombings but also regard the United States of America as a growing threat to their own security, according to a new international opinion poll. The findings suggest that the Islamic world wants to turn its back on both sides in the war on terror, and do not indicate that the US is winning hearts and minds in the Middle East or beyond.

 The Pew Institutes Global Attitudes survey shows increasing Muslim hostility towards violent extremism, particularly in countries that have witnessed its bloody consequences first hand. These include Lebanon, where the proportion of those who say suicide bombing is justified has fallen from 74 per cent in 2002 to 34 per cent. There has also been a sharp fall in support for such terrorism in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Jordan and Indonesia.

 In the past five years there has been a similar marked reduction in support for bin Laden. In Jordan, this has shrunk from 56 per cent to 20 per cent, in Indonesia from 59 per cent to 41 per cent, in Lebanon from 20 per cent to just 1 per cent while even in Pakistan where he is thought to be hiding his backing has dropped from 46 per cent to 38 per cent.

 The exception in this survey were the Palestinian territories, where 70 per cent say suicide bombing can often or usually be justified. Although backing for bin Laden has fallen by 15 per cent, he retains the confidence of the majority.

 The Pew Institute report suggested that globally, economic growth and stability were closely tied to a sense of personal well-being. But there was little evidence to sustain theories that the economy might have a similar beneficial effect on support for terrorism. In Lebanon, economic confidence has plummeted following the military clash with Israel, but Muslims are still less likely to support either bin Laden or Hizbollah. Palestinian support for suicide bombing appears to be fairly uniform across income levels.

 Large majorities of Islamic people in Asia and the Middle East worry that the US could become a military threat to their countries. Such findings may lend support to the views of the British government, among others, that George W. Bushs language about the war on terror and Islamic extremism have convinced many Muslims that they are in the cross-hairs of the American military.

 Muslims in Bangladesh and Morocco are almost unanimous in their suspicion of the US. So are 85 per cent of Indonesians. Turkey a member of Nato has 77 per cent of its population expressing similar fears, while 73 per cent are concerned in Pakistan and the Palestinian territories. Even in Kuwait, 63 per cent of people are worried.

 The belief that the US could pose a threat varies among people of different faiths in Lebanon and Malaysia. Nearly two-thirds of Lebanese Muslims fear threats from the US, compared to 41 per cent of Christians. In Malaysia, Muslims are considerably more likely than Buddhists to see the US as a potential threat.

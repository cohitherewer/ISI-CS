 KEEPING THE CAPITALIST ROADER AT BAY

 The ruling left fails to see the difference between the resistance it faced during its earlier land reforms and the one it is now up against in Singur and Nandigram, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Read the signs

 To leftist liberals in Calcutta, Delhi and elsewhere, the events in Singur and Nandigram have come as a shock almost similar to what they must have felt about the fall of the Berlin Wall or the Soviet Union. They have seen in these episodes the great Fall of the leftist hope, and in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee a great betrayer in the mould of Mikhail Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping. The events are final proof, they are convinced, of Bengals ruling left turning right. 

 This leftist shock is very different from the responses of parties such as the Congress, the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Trinamool makes no bones about its politics it must oppose anything and everything that the Left Front government does. Both the Congress and the BJP should have had no problem with Bhattacharjees development agenda. The governments run by these parties have always been more friendly towards entrepreneurs than towards farmers and workers. In fact, these parties should be happy that Bengals Marxist government is following their examples in its approach to development. 

 If the BJP is crying foul over Singur and Nandigram, the reason goes beyond the partys anxiety to keep Mamata Banerjee in the National Democratic Alliance. Apart from its hatred for communists, the BJP sees them as the real reason why the United Progressive Alliance, and not the NDA, is in power in Delhi. It would not miss an opportunity to get even with the left. That it gets this opportunity in Bengal makes the revenge that much sweeter. 

 The Congress, the original party of capitalist reforms, too, has its reasons. The left is a constant thorn on the UPAs side. It is the Congresss chance now to turn the tables on the communists. The party obviously cannot press the economic argument too hard and is almost a reluctant late-starter in the entire campaign. It was the BJP which pioneered the controversial concept of special economic zones in 2000; the Congress followed it with the SEZ Act last year. 

 But the shock and sadness of leftist intellectuals and other sympathizers are a different matter. Leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), whether in Calcutta or in Delhi, are deceiving themselves by trying to attribute this to Naxalite or Maoist antipathy towards the institutional left. No one would call historian Sumit Sarkar an ultra-leftist. There are hundreds of friends of the left like him who have been shocked and embarrassed by events in Singur and Nandigram. 

 It is not that such leftist sympathizers are against industrialization. Many of them would even argue that the push from agriculture to industry is actually in line with classical Marxism. They would also accept the role of the capital and of the state in this bourgeois transformation. 

 What they are upset about is the fact that a leftist government should so abjectly surrender to the capitalist model of development and that it would use the power of the state and of a communist party in the service of this capitalist development. Their worst shock came from the fact that such a government made so little effort to carry the people with it in implementing the development plans. They complain that the state has been seen as practically declaring a war on the people unwilling to part with their land. All this happens in a police state, the leftist critics would say, and they would know that precisely the same conflicts between the state and the farmers trying to protect their land from entrepreneurs have been upsetting a new group of leftist radicals in China as well. 

 The real questions are: why did the protests against the governments acquisition of land take such a form this time, and why did the CPI(M) fail to get wind of the resistance that it eventually faced? 

 This is not the first time that the Left Front government has acquired farmland for new industries, for urbanization or for infrastructure projects. Earlier acquisitions of such land also involved displacement of people from their traditional livelihoods. Disputes over compensation and rehabilitation are also not new. 

 So, whats new this time that provoked such resistance and rattled a party which has such a strong rural base? Very often, first impressions of controversial events turn out to be plainly wrong or absurdly inadequate. Political parties have their reasons to create their own versions of events. But even observers, with no obvious political biases, can be misled by the political heat. 

 I would argue that the resistance this time is fundamentally related to the dramatically- changed context of the development debate. Over the past few years, the rhetoric in favour of capital and capitalism has grown particularly aggressive. This has made people feel increasingly insecure and powerless to defend themselves in the face of this new onslaught. They are constantly haunted by the fear of losing jobs, facing salary cuts, being thrown out of their homes and shelters, and so on. 

 This certainly is not the whole truth. There are plenty of signs that things have never been so good for businessmen and the upwardly mobile classes. This image of prosperity has created both new aspirations and new fears for a large section of the people. If a cluster of new industrial ventures brings great hopes for a backward state like Orissa, it also strikes its poorest people with fears they had never known before. The result was the death of 13 tribal people in police firing last January in Kalinga Nagar, where land had to be acquired for a major industrial project. 

 This is the context in which Bhattacharjee and the CPI(M) have launched the new industrialization drive in Bengal. It is this context which makes the present scenario very different from the earlier ones, where the people lost their land to new industries but did not feel so threatened as now. On earlier occasions, the new industries were just stray intruders into ordinary peoples lives; the new players of today are seen as part of a large invading army. 

 One measure of the difference between then and now is the mad rush for SEZs. Indias first SEZ was set up in Kandla in 1965. After two generations of economic reforms, China has only six SEZs. All over the world, 400 SEZs are fully functional. According to Kamal Nath, Union commerce minister, the Centre has already approved 237 of the 650 proposals for SEZs from 21 states and three Union territories! In the first phase of the implementation of SEZ proposals, 3.75 lakh acres of land will be required. Ironically, the CPI(M) has fought against SEZs in other states, and thereby added to the countrywide resistance to land acquisition. Today, the party, as the ruler in Bengal, is caught in its own web over acquisition of land for both single industrial projects and an SEZ. 

 There are socio-economic and other differences between Haldia and Rajarhat and between Singur and Nandigram. It is becoming clearer that Bhattacharjees handling of issues relating to compensation and economic rehabilitation of land-losers was inadequately planned. But, to my mind, it is the larger perception of a new threat from an aggressive entrepreneur class and a collaborating government that has helped create the ground for the kind of resistance that Nandigram witnessed.

 Obviously, this mix of hope and fear is a matter of competing perceptions. And who does not know that popular politics is all about manipulating perceptions? If Bhattacharjee has played on, successfully so far, the perception of a new hope for Bengal, Singur and Nandigram gave his opponents their first big opportunity to create a perception of fear. This is where Mamata Banerjee and left liberals make a common cause. The liberal anxiety about Bhattacharjees policies, though, is ideological, while Banerjees, like the BJPs or the Congresss, is purely political. In other words, what to the liberals is a crisis, is an opportunity for Bhattacharjees political enemies. 

 The answer to the other question as to why the CPI(M), despite its massive rural support base, failed to anticipate this resistance is also linked to the changed context. It has been said that the trouble over Singur and Nandigram is the result of the government and the CPI(M) trying to push their agenda in a hurry. That the chief minister still blames a party colleague and chairman of the Haldia Development Authority, Lakshman Seth, for sparking the fear in Nandigram is evidence enough of administrative bungling. 

 The real problem, however, seems to be more complicated. There is no denying that Bengal has been showing some signs of economic promise that had not been seen in the state for decades. It is primarily a result of the new economic agenda which Bhattacharjee has been vigorously pursuing. The new hope gave him a massive mandate in the last elections, but he seems to have been too overwhelmed by it to adequately calculate the political risk of what he considers a great leap forward. And he and his party underestimated their opponents ability to play on the risk factor. 

 This confused reading of the new context explains why the CPI(M) compares the resistance in Singur and Nandigram with the one it had once faced to its land reforms programmes from the rural elite. The difference in the two situations is too obvious to miss. Land reforms, loosely put, were all about giving land to the landless. New industries now require the same government and the party to do the opposite at least in some areas. The CPI(M)s rural base has not been the result of an ideological conquest; it has been there more because of the partys and its governments ability to provide certain benefits to the people. 

 That is the crux of the problem. Bhattacharjee thinks that the only way his government can benefit the people now is by moving from agriculture to industry. To the ideological left, this development thesis is a charade and an excuse for worshipping the false god of capitalism. Obviously, leftism is one thing as an ideology and another in government. Didnt Deng Xiaoping, who had taken part in the Long March with Mao Zedong, turn a capitalist roader?

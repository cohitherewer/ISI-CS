 DERRING-DO

 The snide aerial attack of the Tamil rebel tigers on a Sri Lankan airbase close to Colombo has added insult to injury. The government of the island country, having made much noise about such injuries in the past, seems strangely reticent about baring its hurt this time. And with reason. The bombing of the Katunayake airbase proves that the much-celebrated recapture of rebel territory in the east by the army, and its steady inroads into the north, have done nothing to defang the tigers or push them towards extinction. They reserve enough power and resources to put together, literally piece by piece, an air show. Notwithstanding the number and technical inferiority of the fleet, they can inflict substantial damage to the might of the Sri Lankan air force, and more importantly, to its image. Given that aerial bombing of rebel areas forms a major, and much debated, part of the government offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the airbases were an expected target. The fact that the tigers succeeded in their mission and flew back safely only shows that the government continues to underestimate its adversary. This flawed judgment is singularly responsible for Sri Lankas return to civil war despite the existence of a ceasefire agreement between the government and the rebels. 

 There can be no questioning the governments efforts at trying to cut down to size a terrorist organization like the LTTE. The tigers, by their continuing onslaught against state forces, establishments, peace-keeping missions and even foreign diplomats have erred enough to invite the censure of the international community. However, the governments tendency to look for an answer to the ethnic problem in militaristic means alone is unlikely to help it end the bloodshed. Despite the requisite majority and the pact with the opposition in favour of peace, the Mahinda Rajapakse government has been unable to push through humanitarian measures for the war-ravaged Tamil population or to convince them of its sincerity in finding a solution. Its offensive against the tigers, particularly from the air, and the resultant increase in civilian casualties is definitely not helping matters. To cut out the tigers, it is imperative that the government builds bridges with the Tamil population in the north and the east. Or else, it will have no future to offer to the country.

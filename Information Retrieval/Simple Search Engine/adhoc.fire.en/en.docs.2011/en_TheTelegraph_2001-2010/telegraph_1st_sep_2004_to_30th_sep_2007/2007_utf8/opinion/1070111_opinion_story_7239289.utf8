 SEVEN AGES OF WOMAN

 In the corridors of ABWUs old-age home

 The nondescript iron gates at 89, Elliot Road give little inkling of the world that lies within. The orderliness of the huge compound offers a startling contrast to the chaos and din of the street outside. The moment you step inside, the smell of scrumptious meals being cooked in the kitchen of Suruchi tickles the olfactory nerves. The only sound that greets the ear is the chatter of children at their lessons. Another remarkable feature of this place is the conspicuous absence of men. Whether in taking decisions on legal or financial matters, teaching the children, taking care of the aged in the old-age home, or cooking, managing and serving in the restaurant, it is the women who are in charge.

 The present premises once served as an army barrack for American soldiers. It was handed over to ABWU by the state government in 1949 to provide a shelter for the destitute women who infiltrated the city at the time of the partition of Bengal. Since then, hundreds of rescued women have known this place as their only home. 

 The organization helps the women by providing them with employment, by arranging their marriages or by repatriating them. Stories that can be the stuff of cinema abound. In the early Seventies, a woman, who had been living there since Partition, came upon a labourer helping in the construction work within the premises, and immediately became hysterical, claiming that he was her lost husband, Madhusudan. Enquiries revealed that he was indeed that person. So the couple, separated by history, were reunited, and they lived happily ever after. 

 Some of the girls and boys studying in the primary and pre-primary schools are orphans while others are from the surrounding slums. They break out in a collective Happy New Year and skip gleefully around us. We find some of the children at their midday meal, and going by the smell, the food seems delectable enough. 

 The eldest in the old-age home is close to completing her century. Her friends say that she beats them all in the annual race held for them. Age sits pretty on most of the other women in the home. Having lost their relatives, they now form a contented family among themselves.

 A walk around the premises can be quite a fascinating experience. With a child of six sharing the same ground with a woman of ninety, the seven ages of man appear to be contained within this microcosm. However, it seems that the melancholy Jacques would have altered his vitriolic summary of the stages of human life if only he had seen the seven ages of woman here.

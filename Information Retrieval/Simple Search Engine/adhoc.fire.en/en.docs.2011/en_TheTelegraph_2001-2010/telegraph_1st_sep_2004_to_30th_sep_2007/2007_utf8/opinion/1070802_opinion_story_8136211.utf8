 HARRYS BLISS 

 - Is Potters end bourgeois or radical? 

 Mukul Kesavan

 Anyone who hasnt read Harry 

 Potter and the Deathly Hallows and plans to, should 

 read no further because what follows gives important bits 

 of the plot away. That warning safely out of the way, the 

 last book was an enormous relief. I wasnt looking forward 

 to Deathly Hallows because the three instalments 

 of Harrys adventures that came before this one, had begun 

 to read (despite their bulk) like gigantic plot-summaries 

 for a Mahabharata-length TV serial. 

 I can recall the shape of the 

 first three books without effort and when I think of them, 

 their denouements pop-up on cue: the creepy finish of the 

 first, where Voldemort turns up like a spare face on the 

 back of Quirrells head, the flourishing climax in the second 

 when Harry kills the diary and Tom Riddle with the Basilisks 

 fang and the intense fraternity that makes The Prisoner 

 of Azkaban the best of the seven, the backstory of the 

 doings of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. After Azkaban, 

 the books became shapeless and hard to remember. They were 

 still intricately patterned and plotted, but to what narrative 

 purpose, it was hard to tell. I read them for their set-pieces: 

 the Tri-Wizard tourney, the Quidditch games, Snapes elaborately 

 scripted malice and the reliable anarchy of the Weasley 

 household. 

 The other difficulty with reading 

 the saga after the third book was the way Rowling set about 

 stoking expectation in the lead-up to each volume from the 

 Goblet of Fire on. She would let drop hints that 

 were meant to a) underline the growing maturity of Harry 

 and his friends, and b) encourage the reader to read the 

 saga as an extended coming-of-age story with all its attendant 

 life-lessons, not just a schoolboy romp with broomsticks 

 and wands. Rowlings preferred motif for maturity was Death. 

 Starting with Goblet of Fire, she sent the books 

 on their way with little hints that important characters 

 whom readers might have become attached to, were likely 

 to die. 

 I found this annoying because 

 it changed the way I read the later books. I read them with 

 a fixed anxiety about someone I liked, dying. Luckily no 

 one I really cared about died till Book 6, The Half-Blood 

 Prince, when Dumbledore was killed by Snape. I was unmoved 

 by Cedric Diggorys death in Goblet of Fire, as, 

 I imagine, was everyone who read the book, and Sirius Black 

 seemed so capable of taking care of himself that when he 

 fell out of the story in Order of the Phoenix (by 

 some distance the worst book in the series) I just assumed 

 that he would turn up again. One of the reasons why the 

 later books seemed less pleasurable was that I tore through 

 them at a furious rate just to make sure that the characters 

 I liked were present and accounted for. The pre-release 

 gnomic utterances must have been great for sales, but on 

 the reasonable assumption that Rowling couldnt be strapped 

 for money, she should have held off. Author- inspired teaser-trailers 

 before a book release is a novelty we can do without. 

 Having said that, one of the reasons 

 I liked the last book was that Rowlings oracular mutterings 

 about gloom and doom and death came to nothing. She had 

 wound me up into believing that one of the central characters 

 would die in the last book and for me that boiled down to 

 Harry, Hermione and Ron. Snape was central too, but she 

 couldnt have meant him because nobody would have cared 

 if he died. Ginny, Rons sister and Harrys sometime sweetheart, 

 was a possible candidate along with Hagrid, but by the time 

 I began reading the last one, Id persuaded myself that 

 Rowling was gunning for one of the threesome. I even knew 

 which one: Ron. My reasoning was that in a gang made up 

 of two boys and a girl, no author would dare kill the girl 

 off. 

 I was thrilled that I was wrong 

 but Im pretty sure that Rowling, possessed as she is by 

 the idiot idea that good people dying equals grown-up fiction, 

 considered killing Ron off. Someone sensible must have told 

 her that this would be the most unforgivable authorial whim 

 since Louisa M. Alcott married Larry off to Amy instead 

 of Jo, so she changed her mind...but not completely. When 

 its written, Rowlings authorized biography will reveal 

 (just remember you read it here first) that having spared 

 Ron, she went looking for a really likeable character she 

 could kill off instead and picked Fred. Why Fred? If she 

 wanted a member of the Weasley family, why didnt she, having 

 re-admitted Percy into the family fold, let him redeem himself 

 by dying for his collaborationist sins? Ive designed a 

 T-shirt which reads Fred not Dead in front and No Mercy 

 for Percy at the back. If we march up and down in large 

 enough numbers in front of television cameras maybe shell 

 write us an alternative ending? 

 Still, she didnt kill off Ron 

 because she realized in good time that she had spent years 

 writing a buoyant epic that had as its substance not the 

 simple-minded darkness that she periodically injected into 

 it via murder, in the hope of giving it literary 

 heft, but the lightness that happiness brings. 

 In the same way, she did a good 

 job suggesting Hitler and the Nazi subversion of Weimar 

 as Voldemort took over the Ministry of Magic, rounded up 

 the mudbloods, and let his stormtroopers kill a few. But 

 she didnt allow a mudblood Holocaust because she recognized 

 that that would be tragedy on a scale that her chosen genre 

 couldnt bear. 

 Which brings me to the final chapter 

 of Deathly Hallows, the one called Nineteen Years 

 Later, in which Harry and Ginny bring their children to 

 Platform 9 to see them off on the Hogwarts Express. Ron 

 and Hermione join them there with two children of their 

 own. Its the happiest of happy endings, shamelessly designed 

 to twang big nostalgic heartstrings, to make our eyes prickle 

 for young Harry and Hermione and Ron. For children who grew 

 up with the series, its like a flashback to the magical 

 childhood they never had. 

 I keep hearing grown-up readers 

 moan about how bourgeois and suburban this coda is, how 

 dispiriting that after seven hectic books, Rowling chooses 

 to hold out domestic wedded bliss complete with children 

 as the consummation her readers should aspire to. There 

 are two things to be said about this. One, the trajectory 

 of the entire series, leads to this conclusion: this isnt 

 a tacked-on end. Harry, in case anyones forgotten, was 

 orphaned early, fostered by horrible surrogate parents, 

 then forced to spend his young life fighting the Devil in 

 several incarnations: given the context, a happily ever 

 after made up of domestic contentment seems a reasonable 

 aspiration. Two, the politically correct trendies who find 

 Rowlings take on married bliss a little infra and banal, 

 ought to remember that Hermiones a mudblood and Ron, in 

 wizarding terms, is highly pedigreed. In their union, they 

 symbolize hybridity and miscegenation: what could be more 

 radical than that?

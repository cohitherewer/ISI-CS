The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Still a horror show

 Sir The reports, Head pulled out, baby in womb (Feb 22) and Rat rampage no novelty (Feb 23), reveal the ugly face of healthcare in a resurgent Bengal. A large number of people continue to remain at the mercy of quacks who thrive in many corners of the state. Of course, once such incidents come to light, the media raises a hue and cry, which dies down after a while. The quacks then return to business, right under the nose of the police and health authorities. That the conditions are no better even in state-owned hospitals has been amply demonstrated by recurrent incidents of rodents eating up bodies at the morgue of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital. Earlier, ants had caused the death of a patient by nibbling at her eyes. These frightening stories bring to light the poor state of health administration, both in rural and urban Bengal. It is shocking to note that nothing has been done to improve the situation despite the frequent occurrence of such events. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Instances of overcharging by nursing homes have become a dime a dozen in Calcutta. Diagnostic centres and nursing homes have come up in practically every locality, but most of them do not offer even basic facilities. One fails to understand how the municipal corporation and the health department issue them licences to these institutions which are run in a manner so as to earn maximum profit. On the other hand, there are the government-owned hospitals which are unhygienic and inefficient. Stray dogs and cats have a free run in the wards and often bite the patients. The chief minister must intervene immediately to stop the extortion racket in private nursing homes to improve the situation. He should simultaneously devise a programme of upgrading the administration and facilities of state-run hospitals. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Repeat offenders

 Sir The boat tragedy in Kerala shows how callous Indians are in general, and not just the concerned authorities (Cruise claims school kids, Feb 21). Small boats used for taking tourists around a place and commuting on a daily basis always tend to exceed their capacity. In this particular case, the boat sunk in a reservoir of the Periyar river after 50 children boarded the vessel, this despite the fact that it could accommodate only ten. The authorities that cleared the trip and made the arrangements for the children and their teachers should be severely punished along with the boatman. They are guilty of nothing less than murder through negligence. Of what use are inquiries and reports when children have to die for no fault of theirs? 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir A school excursion turning into a tragedy is an oft-repeated story. Fifteen children and three teachers died after their boat capsized. Such incidents also shows the administrations inability to learn from experience. But one cannot blame the authorities alone. Even the general public fares poorly when it comes to following rules. This is borne out by the rise in the number of road accidents in the country. As is usual in such cases, an inquiry will follow and money doled out to parents. But can such steps improve things? 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Wrong turn

 Sir Mohammad Yunuss decision to plunge into politics is unfortunate (Yunus takes political plunge, Feb 19). Politics is all about dirty games and self-aggrandizement. Therefore, it is surprising to see a man like Yunus testing these choppy waters. 

 The Nobel laureate has been working hard to try and free the poor from the clutches of moneylenders through micro-credit financing, which has earned him recognition and respect from people all across the world. Micro-credit financing has proved to be useful in developing countries where the poor are victims of economic exploitation. 

 Although Bangladeshis seem to be happy with Yunuss decision, one fears that this is not the right move as hardened politicians will marginalize him in no time. Yunus, unlike politicians, can better serve the masses with his social and economic projects. If his name gets mired in controversy, which is likely to happen once he joins the political bandwagon, his achievements for all these years will come to nought. Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since its inception and many seasoned politicians have failed to bring about any stability or long-lasting change to this country. It is doubtful whether Yunus will be able to achieve these in his career as a politician. After all, he is a rank newcomer to the world of politics.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

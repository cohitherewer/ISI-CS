 Rules are for breaking

 MALA FIDE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Our members of parliament are proving to be a rather strange tribe of people, many of whom have run amok, misusing their position and privilege. From breaking building norms to conducting illegal businesses like helping the transit of people without requisite papers they have collectively made a mockery of everything that spells dignity and integrity.

 First and foremost, the red light atop their white ambassadors must be banned. Why should these men and women not have to face the horrors of traffic as we are compelled to? Why cant they wait at traffic lights and get stuck in traffic snarls that, more often than not, are the making of their senior colleagues who get cheap thrills when streets are cleared of constituents for them to move ahead. This one fact is symbolic of their arrogance and inappropriate purpose. Why are their cars not challaned for breaking the rules that their officers have put in place? And, why are the rules applicable to us if those who institute them disregard them? 

 Government property in Delhi, for example, is vandalized by a majority of those who are allocated these bungalows. Stringent rules apply for us, but they are all waived for them. It is truly sickening. If I cover a space in my garden, my personal property on which I pay yearly tax and maintain because it belongs to me, and create a greenhouse to nurture plants in the summer, I am regularly visited by officers of the municipality. Either they will force me to demolish the structure or they will happily accept some lucre and walk away only to return periodically with enhanced demands! This is called hafta in vernacular parlance, meaning weekly. However, across Lutyenss Delhi, where a strict code exists against extra construction, every minister, MP, secretary to the government of India has indulged in merrily breaking the law, adding rooms, enclosing open areas, destroying heritage architecture. Is this their privilege, or is it their intellectual and moral poverty? Why should the citizens be reprimanded for following their leaders? The president and prime minister should tell us why we should not follow our leaders and break the law ! 

 Perks and privileges

 Why should MPs travel free on the railways? It amounts to ticketless travel and there is no rationale for it. And worse, if you have been an MP once, you are entitled to ticketless travel for life. You also get upgraded on the national airline. Why? Full paying passengers and I have been the victim of this are downgraded, or they are requested to fly another time or day, to allow an MP to travel ticketless. It is as though no one save an MP has work, or family, or dignity. This is why everyone wants an election ticket, including leaders of industry who want nominations to the Rajya Sabha! This is how the species gets its kicks.

 Successful people and first-rate professionals, whether in politics or elsewhere, get their kicks from their work and their passion. In India, alas, this is an endangered species, much like the magnificent tiger, dying despite a task force. Imagine wanting a lackey to push his way t hrough a dignified queue at an airport counter, to get you to the head of the line, having disrupted all systems. It is embarrassing to see our leaders behave in such an uncouth manner.

 MPs must be stripped of all their privileges, and forced to operate with the privileges this nation bestows upon its honest citizens. They must represent the people in every way. The honorable prime minister, an austere and dignified man, should enforce this new and dignified code of conduct. MPs will be bereft of their perks, and India will celebrate the beginning of democracy. Charge them premium rates for their privileges a privilege tax. Till then, all those who oppose the perks and privilege raj of the intellectually underprivileged MPs, will be harangued and harassed. So be it.

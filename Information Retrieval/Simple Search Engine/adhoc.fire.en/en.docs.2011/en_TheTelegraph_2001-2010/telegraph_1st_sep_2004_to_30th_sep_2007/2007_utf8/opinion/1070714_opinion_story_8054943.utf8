 MISUSING THE SPACE

 Ananda Lal

 Theatre

 The local segment of Odeon 2007 featured open-air folk performances and four original Bengali plays. Raybeshe, Bhaoyaiya, Bhatiyali and Putul Nach deserved exposure under the first banner, but it made little sense to include bauls, Chhau and Santal dance since one cant imagine a Calcuttan who hasnt seen these forms ( Alkap, Bahurupi, Gambhira, Kabi Larai or Panchali should have replaced them). Fittingly, the raining deities washed most of them out. 

 By co-opting Star Theatre as one of the auditoria, Odeon successfully introduced the rebuilt playhouse to the Bengali mainstream, but the chosen groups couldnt capitalize on its perfect picture-frame proscenium. Only Naba Mayukh utilized the space effectively, riding their tried-and-tested formula of a musical spectacle applied to the folktale of Gopichand (picture). Rishi Mukhopadhyay dramatized the story of the power-hungry queen, whose cloistered son gets transformed upon exile into a sanyasi, returning to take over as a benevolent ruler. Using percussion emotively, the characters stressing their words by beating drums midstage, the ensemble delivers a variety of singing styles climaxing in a totally unexpected democratic paean Janaganamana. Still, Gopichand has considerable ballast that requires dumping. 

 At least Naba Mayukh has theatrical sophistication, which the others lacked to the degree that one wondered, if theirs were the best scripts submitted for the festival, why the better Bengali playwrights didnt write in. Although Odeon gives adequate funding, Unity Malanchas Bishesh Bishesh Khabar was abysmally staged. Samar Chattopadhyays idea is laudable, of an anchor driven neurotic by the violent daily news he reports, and the terrible fate that befalls his daughter, but Debasish Sarkar just cant direct it coherently. 

 Here, as in Belghoria Ethics Sthanankan, excessive time goes waste on supernumeraries dancing or prancing, indicating a desperation to achieve the minimum duration for a full-length play. Sthanankan recalls Ionescos Amedee, as a couple contemplates what to do with a cadaver in their flat, and then takes an intriguing twist as the corpse begins talking to each in turn, rousing metaphorical skeletons in the closets of their past. But Debasis Senguptas concept goes haywire as, incongruously, a band of hoods in fatigues threatens them with eviction. 

 Shrachis Greenwood Festival, with shows at 3 pm and 6 pm, even on weekdays, must believe that only the unemployed go to theatre. But, commendably, it does award a prize for best district production. Mukhomukhis technically-savvy Nashta Asim, directed by Biplab Bandyopadhyay, has a strong premise. It is about a boy pressured to excel by his parents, who use an interactive computer to programme his days, but Hara Bhattacharyas script meanders and auto-destructs like Hal in 2001, after he runs out of things to say.

 DRYING UP

 It is becoming difficult for India to look away from the reality of global warming. About 80 per cent of the Himalayan glacial cover might melt because of the rising temperatures and confront India with a severe freshwater crisis around 2030. This warning has come from a draft report by the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change whose first report, published earlier this year, showed how human activity has contributed significantly to climate change. Even if humans were to change their behaviour now, mainly with regard to controlling carbon emission, the earth would still be a more dangerous place in the future, plagued by extreme weather events and their fairly disastrous consequences. And the poorer, developing countries like China and India are also going to have to bear the brunt of climate change to a greater degree than the developed ones. Yet India and China are also among the heaviest emitters of greenhouse gases.

 It is, therefore, becoming imperative for India to not look at itself as a victim of global warming caused by the richer nations, but to take responsibility for changing attitudes and practices with regard to the environment. Water scarcity and riparian fluctuations are going to affect a developing nation in fundamental ways. Indian policy-makers, politicians and citizens are not very good with long-term visions of conservation, and the face of development that they are getting used to approving of involves rapid and indiscriminate growth of urban housing, roads and industry. Water is a necessary yet threatened resource in all this. Both deforestation and auto-emission are likely to be enhanced by such development. In West Bengal, for instance, failure to control air pollution does not bode well for the governments capacity to understand and deal with the magnitude of the problem. It is time for India to have a concrete vision of the future in terms of climate change, and summon up the civic and political will to implement that vision.

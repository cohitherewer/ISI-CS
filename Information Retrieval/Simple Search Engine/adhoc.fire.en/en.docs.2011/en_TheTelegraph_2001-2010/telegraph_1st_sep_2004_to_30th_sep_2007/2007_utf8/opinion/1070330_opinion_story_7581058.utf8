The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Tattered songs of sorrow and bliss

 The photographs by Waswo X. Waswo in INDIA POEMS: THE PHOTOGRAPHS (Gallerie, Rs 1,750) intend to transport the viewer to a nebulous Otherworld, from which men and women with wizened faces and cows with doleful eyes stare out serenely. Rajahs take elephant rides in Jaipur, hooded figures hold eternal council on the ghats of Pushkar and a rickety dog has only its shadow for company (right). It is that Incredible Indiyah seen once in a dream and lost since in a nightmare of globalization. Waswos eye for the exotic seems to have specialized in picking out gorgeous young men who remind one of the punkha-puller with his divine physique in E.M. Forsters A Passage to India. The photograph on the left, entitled Rupesh with a medallion, is an instance of this fascination.

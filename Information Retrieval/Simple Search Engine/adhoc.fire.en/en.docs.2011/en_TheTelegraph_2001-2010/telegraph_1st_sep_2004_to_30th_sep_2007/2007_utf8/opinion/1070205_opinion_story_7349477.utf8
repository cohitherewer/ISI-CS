 MOUSE CURE

 If only one could be spared by a click of the mouse from being cheated, harassed, maimed or killed by medical treatment in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research has signed a contract with an international publishing house that would give internet access to updated and reliable medical information to anybody with a computer in India. India is the first low income country to avail itself of this site, and it is expected to be of help to both medical personnel and ordinary people who need to check on the treatment they are receiving from the former. Any facility that might produce less ignorant doctors should be welcome in India. Unfortunately, websites can increase only the sum of medical information in doctors, and not of scruple . After politicians and the police, doctors are perhaps the most unreliable and dangerous people in this country, and the public healthcare system the sphere in which economic inequality takes the most brutal form. So, to call this service free and to think of it as giving ordinary Indians access to essential medical information is a bit of a joke. 

 About 35 per cent of Indians are illiterate (nor can one consult cochrane.org if one can only sign ones name in a vernacular), and 70 per cent live in villages. So the vast section of the population that is most persistently brutalized by the countrys healthcare system will hardly feel the difference from such a source of state-of-the-art medical information. And those who can afford a computer can also ensure for themselves better treatment, although this is true only in relative terms. The advance of knowledge and technology, is however, a very peculiar process in India, riven with contradictions and unfortunate ironies. Yet initiatives like this cannot be dismissed as impractical and inappropriate either. But bodies like the ICMR have a more basic set of responsibilities than such essentially cosmetic moves: to provide rudimentary, but quality healthcare to people whose access to such services are hindered by systemic injustices that require a different order of planning and execution altogether.

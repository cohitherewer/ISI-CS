 FORGETTING TO LAUGH

 If political correctness were to win completely, what would the world be like? Mirthless, unfree and violent. Laughter, especially of the self-directed kind, seldom co-exists with bigotry. So, it is worrying to see that some Sikhs in India have suddenly started taking very serious offence to that most irresistibly silly of human creations, the Sardar Joke. They have demanded that the Mumbai police should block websites which publish jokes with sardars as objects of ridicule. The publisher of The Santa and Banta Joke Book had also been arrested recently for what the Indian Penal Code calls deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings. In this case, what seem to have been hurt are not so much religious feelings as a collective sense of self-worth. Years of being stereotyped as being endearingly stupid apparently take their terrible toll on the young, who might then grow up with damagingly low self-worth. This logic, if that is what it is, is both absurd and sad. It is harmful for young people, from whatever community, to grow up in a society devoid of humour. Teaching the young to forget how to laugh at themselves is the wrong way of making them feel good about themselves. This is particularly sad for a community known for its robust sense of humour. It is not difficult to imagine Mr Khushwant Singhs dismay at receiving a notice, recently, from the lawyers of a Sikh religious body saying that if he did not stop making sardar jokes, legal action would be taken against him. He threw the notice in his waste-paper basket.

 But Britain, as usual, takes the cake when it comes to political correctness. And the roots of its sensitiveness lie in collective paranoia rather than in being civilized and respectful. A Yorkshire school changed the eponymous three little pigs of the childrens story into three little puppies so as not to offend Muslims. This was entirely pre-emptive, since nobody had actually objected. Then there was a rather senseless debate over the whole thing among the teachers and local councillors, and it was decided to turn the puppies into pigs again. The funniest thing about this palaver was that the teachers had taken, not the traditional version of the story, but Roald Dahls deliciously horrid retelling of it in his Revolting Rhymes (an antidote to political correctness if ever there was one). To take up Roald Dahl and then try to neutralize his offensiveness must, indeed, take a great deal of highly complex social thinking. It is multiculturalism gone berserk not in the hands of the Many being tolerated and celebrated, but in the minds of the One doing the tolerating and celebrating.

 The failure of humour, if properly told, often becomes, in itself, the funniest of stories except that the fun ceases to be entirely delightful. Earnest Sikhs and grimly tolerant British Christians would do better to refrain from projecting their own humourlessness as the only way of being civilized.

 POLITICS ISNT POLITICAL

 Is it better to keep an activist than to lose a politician? Mohammed Yunuss decision to drop his plans of creating his own party is not just a comment on the political crisis in Bangladesh. It should make the democracies of the developing world reflect on what constitutes political action. If the ideal goal of politics is social change, then why are politics and social activism inevitably regarded as conflicting pursuits in the real world today? Why do leading a political party and running an NGO sound like mutually exclusive activities in the sphere of subcontinental realpolitik? Mr Yunuss withdrawal from politics sounds like a response to being thwarted by circumstances. But it could also be seen as a positive choice rather than a negative act of withdrawal by a person whose work has been to help the poor choose and create their own destinies. In that sense, the founding principles of Mr Yunuss pioneering work in micro-credit are profoundly political. But to use the word political in this way is to take the full measure of its distance from its cognate in party politics. And the public declaration of his inability to bridge this distance is also a personal comment a ruefully critical one on this unbridgeability.

 To break the myth of the naturalness of poverty (like the naturalness of slavery or imperial rule) forms the core of Mr Yunuss activism. It is elaborated into a distinction between equal abilities and unequal opportunity. This, in turn, becomes a question of representation, as Mr Yunus seeks to represent the poor as creditworthy, even as he educates the poor to prove themselves so. In all this, radically disempowered people, like women and beggars, are encouraged to take control of their own lives and of their capacity to inspire trust in people. These principles denaturalizing poverty, ensuring equal opportunity and representing the marginal are essentially political, in the most comprehensive sense of the word. In Mr Yunuss case, these are not only principles, but also templates for concrete and self- sustaining action (although he cannot be unaware of the limits of micro-credits capacity in improving the lives of the poor). This active and practical component is also essential to the politicial nature of his work.

 It is a paradox of the developing world that the representation and empowerment of the poor and the marginalized of women and children, for example have created a sharp divide between the governmental and the non-governmental. In countries like India and Bangladesh, non-governmental organizations have taken up the work of development, of social and sexual justice, in ways that are increasingly being perceived as creating a conflicting distinction between development and governance. The State and civil society become like two different estates here, reflecting the distance between politics and the political, between the people and the parties. It is this distance that Mr Yunus is making his country, and its neighbours, confront.

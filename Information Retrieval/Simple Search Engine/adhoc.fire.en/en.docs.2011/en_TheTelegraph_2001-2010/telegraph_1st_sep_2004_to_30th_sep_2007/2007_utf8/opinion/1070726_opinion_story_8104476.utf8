 PAYING A HEAVY PRICE

 CHINA DIARY - Neha Sahay

 The execution of Zheng Xiaoyu, the 63-year-old head of the Chinese Food and Drug Administration, 10 days ago, was shocking not only because of the swiftness with which it was carried out four months from arrest to execution not only because this was the first time in five years that an official of such high rank was executed, but mainly because of Zhengs haunted face when he heard his sentence.

 The tradition has been that if an official confesses, he is generally given a lighter sentence. In his confession, Zheng had promised to return the $ 842,000 he had taken from drug manufacturers. But he was executed anyway. 

 But what about punishing the manufacturers who bribed Zheng? Zheng named nine of them in his written confession. Between 2001-2003, Zheng had approved of six medicines that turned out to be fake. Yet, the only other person sentenced to death was Zhengs deputy, with a two-year reprieve, which means he might eventually get life imprisonment. One more FDA official was given life, while two others got sentences of 13 and 15 years respectively.

 Zhengs confession once again brings to light the contradictions in Chinas socialist market economy. In economic terms, China is a paradise for entrepreneurs. But politically, the communist partys writ continues to reign, though communist ideology is now not even to be found in school textbooks. Zhengs confession revives memories of Maos days, when those accused of any crime had to undergo self-criticism, affirm their faith in the wisdom of the communist party and Mao Ze Dongs thought, and repent their sins.

 Strong message

 Zheng wrote in his confession: The Party and people nurtured me, trusted me and assigned me to such an important position. I didnt live up to the Partys expectation. I...harmed the Party and the people, committed crimes, for which I feel regretful. Now I have to...conduct a thorough self-examination, confess my mistakes, and treat the punishment and education as an act of saving my soul. Inspired by the policy that honest confession should be rewarded lenient punishment, I have...honestly confessed to the Party the fact that I accepted bribes.

 Zhengs case is particularly tragic because he started off as an idealist. Setting up an FDA was his idea; so was the mandatory Good Manufacturing Practices certificate that all companies had to have before they could register new medicines. But, in July 2005, six persons died and 80 were seriously affected after being given antibiotic injections from a company that had a GMP certificate.

 Most Chinese feel that these lives would have gone unlamented had it not been for the global food scare generated by contaminated Chinese products. First it was cough syrup contaminated with an industrial chemical that caused 51 deaths in Panama; then toothpaste containing the same product was found in several Latin American countries; this was followed by contaminated pet food that caused deaths of dogs and cats in the US.

 The US and Canada have been blocking imports from China too often for China to remain silent. In its defence, China has blamed Panamanian businessmen for passing off industrial glycerine exported by a Chinese company as medicinal glycerine. It has also started banning US products as unsafe. But the strongest message it could send to its international trade partners was the execution of Zheng Xiaoyu.

 Last month, officials admitted that 20 per cent of food products made in China in the first half of 2007 were found to be substandard. Throughout this period, Zheng was out of office. And just last week, an informal expats meet heard how a high-level local party functionary undertook an inspection of a foreign pharmaceutical company without even stepping inside the manufacturing area.

 SHARED INTERESTS

 The proposed changes in the bill on sexual harassment in the workplace show that sexual politics at the place of work and its repercussions are now understood slightly better than when the bill was first drafted in 2005. The bill defined harassment as an open or discreet demand for sexual favours or other forms of insinuations that compromised the professional performance and mental equilibrium of the victim. It thus gave the employee the power to set right a long-established anomaly in work relations between two genders. The creation of a proper work environment was the assumed target. Since preferential treatment on the basis of the grant or refusal of sexual favours could not affect only the victim who faced such demands, it is only expected that any other employee who stood to lose out from a sexualized work environment should have the power to act against it as well. The changes in the bill on this score thus live up to the reality. However, the other reality that it misses is that although women constitute the majority of employees vulnerable to sexual politics in the workplace, they are not its only victims. 

 The existing legislation, as also the proposed one, resiliently turns its face against this fact. The law allows the woman employee alone to decide what is a sexually-determined behaviour. It provides for the complaints committee to be dominated by women on a preconceived belief in its sympathies. And, more recently, the bill has removed inquiry proceedings in sexual harassment cases from the purview of the Right to Information Act in order to safeguard womens interests. Quite clearly, the States paternalistic attitude towards women guides this gendered law-making. But a law that aims at combating sexual harassment in a workplace shared by men and women cannot use such a biased rhetoric. There is no doubt that in a labour market which is yet to break out of the stereotype and employ women in less conforming roles, women will continue to be at a disadvantage. But it is unlikely that their vulnerability will cease with the State continuing to play its self-anointed role of the protector. If the intention is to make the work environment less hostile and more equitable, the law cannot remain partial or be blind to the more subtle power play that sexual harassment entails in the workplace and how it affects workers.

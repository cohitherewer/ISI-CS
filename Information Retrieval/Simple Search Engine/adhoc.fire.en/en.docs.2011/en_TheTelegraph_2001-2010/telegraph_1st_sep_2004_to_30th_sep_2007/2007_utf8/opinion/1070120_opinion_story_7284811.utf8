The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Its a 

dogs life

 Shilpa Shetty has within a week 

morphed from a woman with a great 

body to a symbol of racial equality 

 There was a time, not so long ago, when the world was broadly divided into two. A minuscule section really very, very small knew about an actress called Shilpa Shetty. The rest of the world said, Shilpa, who? 

 Nobody says that anymore. For Shetty, within the span of a week, has morphed from a woman with a great body, albeit a tricky nose, to a symbol of racial equality. Those who have been fighting colour biases in the West love her. Anybody with a feeling for the tricolour salutes her. And Channel 4 whose programme featuring Shetty has seen an enormous increase in viewership in the last week cant have enough of her. Shetty, clearly, has done her bit to write history. 

 And thats really a bit strange, for Shetty herself has done very little. All that she did do, allegedly for Rs 3.5 crore, was sign up for Channel 4s reality show, Celebrity Big Brother, which put all kinds of people together in one house, and waited for them to tear each other apart. The cast did just that. A couple of women took potshots at Shetty, whose crime was that the chicken she had cooked was underdone. Incensed, they let loose a tirade against her. Someone got confused about her nationality; someone thought the Tulu-speaker had a language problem. Somebody else saw canine traits in her. 

 Life has not been the same for Shetty since then. Anti-racism groups have picked up cudgels on her behalf, Germaine Greer has supported her, the Indian government has threatened action and some of the celebrities have apologised. 

 It is a huge bonus to be written about like this on a regular basis, says director Mahesh Bhatt. It definitely will get some film makers to sign her when she returns as they will want to encash on her new found popularity, adds Bhatt. 

 Thats good news for Shetty. For the actress who first made her mark when she danced, legs akimbo, with Askhay Kumar to a song called Churakey dil mera has never made it to the big league. And this despite the fact that she had everything going for her soulful eyes, a 5-10 height, a curvaceous body and, after an alleged rhinoplasty, even an altered nose. 

 Still, Shetty has been busy. She started way back in 1993 with Baazigar. A dozen years later, she is still around, and much remembered especially in the cow belt for her special appearance with the song Main aai hoon UP, Bihar lootne in a film called Shool in 1999. Everyone still remembers that song. It was a one-off item number in my career but it stood out, said Shetty with a laugh before she left for Britain. 

 No, you cant accuse Shetty of giving up the race. For one, a la Rekha and good wine, shed improved with age. She wanted to be perfect, says a leading cosmetic surgeon who knows her well. She was already working on her physique to be thin at the right places and the nose was important as her face was on camera all the while. 

 Shettys fans hold that she has the most seductive midriff in Bollywood. And, as a dancer, of course, there are few who can touch her. I think she is the best dancer in Bollywood, says dancer-choreographer Prabhu Deva. I worked with her in Mr Romeo and I found her to be brilliant. 

 But, strangely, despite such assets, Shetty has never really made it big. The only time she made it to prime time news was when she got dragged into a murky case of extortion. The eldest daughter of Surendra and Sunanda Shetty the family is in the business of making tamper-proof caps for the pharmaceutical industry hit the headlines in 2002 when the Surat police issued arrest warrants against her parents. Shetty had modelled for a Gujarat-based saree company which had not paid up. Reports claimed Shettys parents got in touch with the underworld in Mumbai in a bid to get the money. 

 But the volleyball player from Poddar College in Mumbai has always managed to bounce right back after any kind of a fall. Her reported affair and subsequent break up with former co-actor Akshay Kumar didnt weigh her down either. The two stopped dating each other when their film Dhadkan (2000) was still being shot. The failed romance even boosted her career as she went down South to work in three Telugu films which became super hits. 

 It was Dus in 2005 that proved you cant yet write off the old student of St. Anthony Girls High School, Chembur. Shetty herself a black belt in karate won praise for her role of a terrorist hunter. Shilpa is a great fighter, says her actress-sister, Shamita. 

 What has to be seen now is how she fights her way to the top of Celebrity Big Brother. She will never lose hope, holds Shamita. I know she cried. But she has enough guts to take on the world. I guess you should see the show further. 

 If nothing else, the show may well put Shetty on the global celebrity map. Garv, a 2004 film that starred Shetty and Salman Khan, did rather well in the United Kingdom. Not surprisingly, director Anurag Basu and the UTV camp cant wait for Shetty to return. For when she does, their film, Metro, starring Shetty, Konkona Sen Sharma and Shiney Ahuja, will be released. And many, no doubt, hope that the film would become a hit in the UK where Shetty is now a household name. 

 Still, her mother, Sunanda, is a bit pensive. I just hope she doesnt face any problems after all this media coverage. But she is a fighter and will take it to the end as people now say, she says. 

 Shetty has garnered such support in recent days that many believe she may end up as a champion in the show which eliminates people one by one as it moves to its climax. And that will be the proverbial silver lining to the cloud of racial abuse. It almost makes it worth being referred to as Mans Best Friend.

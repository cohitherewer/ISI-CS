The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 It cost a lot to keep Gandhi poor. It costs no less to sell his philosophy in the 21st century. The two-day meet in the capital on peace, non-violence and empowerment, to mark the centenary of the Mahatmas satyagraha in South Africa, drained the public exchequer of several crores of rupees, and ended up advertising another Gandhi the resident of 10, Janpath. The star speaker at the conference, attended by dignitaries from some 80-odd countries and coordinated by the MEA, was Sonia Gandhi. The prime minister got to read out his set piece on the second day, but it was the Congress presidents address that kept playing on Doordarshan and AIR. Madams pre-eminence was perhaps natural given the fact that it was a Congress conference, as the party spokesperson, Devendra Dwivedi, conceded. It was also perhaps in acknowledgement of the partys current working relations with the communists that the left found place in the jamboree. The ones missing entirely were the saffronites, who, given their unworkable relation with the Congress, did not even get an invitation. Yet, wouldnt the message of peace and non-violence have done them a world of good?

 The badshah of Bollywood is clearly a winner at 10, Janpath. The Shah Rukh Khan-anchored KBC is reportedly watched by the babalogs of the Nehru-Gandhi family whenever they find time to sit before the television screen. Rahul Gandhi, seemingly, loves to beat the contestant in answering the questions. Priyankas son, Rehan, too, is much fond of the star. The feeling got stronger after his visit to the shooting of a film with his parents on an invitation from SRK himself. The friendship, as evident till now, has little politics in it. Incidentally, it is not known if KBC was watched at 10, Janpath when Big B anchored it.

 The finance minister of Punjab, Surinder Singla, who is Navjot Sidhus opponent in the parliamentary by-election in Amritsar, is very cut up about being labelled an agent of a well-known industrial house by Arun Jaitley. On being questioned about the matter, Singla neither denied nor confirmed his proximity to the house. Instead, he reeled off the names of several BJP leaders who functioned as agents. Of course, neither Jaitley nor Sidhu figured in the list. 

 Fortune seems to have stopped smiling on Kamal Nath. The man who found the prized portfolio of commerce and industry fall into his lap in 2004 without trying too hard, now finds himself beleaguered on several fronts. Naths pet project of special economic zones is not making him very popular with his adversaries. They have taken the matter up with madam. The prime minister himself, apparently, is not too happy with Nath. Things are not too pleasant for Kamal Nath on the home front either. His pocketborough, Chhindwara, is supposed to come under review by the delimitation commission. If Chhindwara is reserved for scheduled tribes, Nath will find the going ever more difficult. The BJP has been trying hard for some time now to get Chhindwara reserved citing that 30 per cent of its population is tribal. Make the most of the remaining time, Nath!

 Mulayam Singh Yadav is now so shaky about his electoral prospects that he is reported to be reaching out to his former allies and friends. Days ago, the UP CM supposedly called up his former treasurer, Amitabh Adhar, who had switched boats to be in the Congress. His intention had been to assess if Adhar could work his influence on Raj Babbars crusade against him. The quest, naturally, came a cropper.

 Pressure is mounting on the Congress high command to find a replacement for the ailing Arjun Singh, who has been unable to attend office regularly. A priority sector like education cannot be without a head. Which is why the knowledge commission chairman, Sam Pitroda, is supposed to have advised the government for a new appointment. Kapil Sibals name is doing the rounds. Madams inner voice, however, is yet to speak out for the change to happen.

 There is no reason to paint the BJP president, Rajnath Singh, as a villain. The reshuffle in the party clearly bears the stamp of the RSS. The removal of Modi from the powerful parliamentary board does not necessarily signal the RSSs loss of confidence in him. It reflects Jhandewalans fine balancing act. Modis removal is, perhaps, intended to offset the negative fallout resulting from the removal of Sanjay Joshi, a top RSS inductee in the BJP, from the post of the BJP gen-sec (organizational). Joshis downfall, following a sex scandal, was, after all, seen in the RSS as Modis handiwork. Modis downsizing would placate not only key sangh parivar functionaries, who deemed Joshi as invaluable after his role in shaming LK Advani in the Jinnah controversy. It would also please BJP dissidents in Gujarat, led by Keshubhai Patel, who had every reason to feel happy about Modis apparent sidelining. Meanwhile, Modi can carry on, as before.

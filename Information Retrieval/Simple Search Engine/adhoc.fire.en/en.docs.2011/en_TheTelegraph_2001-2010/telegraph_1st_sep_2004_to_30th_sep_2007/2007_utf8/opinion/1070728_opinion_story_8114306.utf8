The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOTHING QUITE LIKE IT FOR COOLING THE BLOOD

 Fauzia Marikar

 Music

 A long time ago, when this reviewer had the temerity to rope in James Stephens for the role of Balthazar in a production of Gian Carlo Menottis Amahl and the Night Visitors into which he gamely threw himself with Jamesian commitment someone commented, with innocent sincerity, that to be around James when he was singing was to be quite, quite happy. And on July 25 at the Calcutta School of Music, as he walked on the stage and bestowed on his audience his mellow, golden baritone, there was a similar wonderful feeling of relaxation and happiness. Accompanied by the 18-year-old Canadian, Emily Tredger, at the piano, he began with two Welsh songs, The Ash Grove and Davis of the White Rock. Stephenss easy control of breathing and intonation set the tone for an evening of pleasurable listening. 

 James founded and runs Udayan, a home for children of leprosy patients. He was ordained a priest in 1986 and Vicar of St. Pauls Cathedral, St. Johns Church, St. Andrews and other churches of the Calcutta diocese, a fact that he used with terse humour to introduce The Vicar of Bray. Two more English songs followed: Drink to me only, and then an unusual baritone rendering of Nymphs and Shepherd, which one always associates with high young sopranos, but which lost none of its jollity in Jamess singing. Emily Tredgers little interlude with the Allemande and the Courante from J.S. Bachs English Suite No. 5 was played with the sensitivity and freshness of youth, as was the second movement of Beethovens Pathetique Sonata that followed after the short intermission.

 Among the rest of the programme was the Hebridean Skye-Boat Song and Ye banks and braes so dear to lovers of Rabindrasangeet. The hippopotamus song by Flanders and Swann, written in the humourous idiom of the early half of the 20th century, was introduced with an invitation to the boys and girls of Udayan to join in the chorus. It had the whole audience singing along lustily with Mud, mud, glorious mud/ Nothing quite like it for cooling the blood. The last offering was the poignant Ol Man River, made famous by Paul Robeson (picture), with lyrics by Jerome Kerr and music by Oscar Hammerstein. One was drawn to the lowest note in the song by his great, effortless voice.

 As an encore, Stephens sang his favourite Lord of the Dance and was joined in the chorus by the pure, silvery voices of the children of Udayan.

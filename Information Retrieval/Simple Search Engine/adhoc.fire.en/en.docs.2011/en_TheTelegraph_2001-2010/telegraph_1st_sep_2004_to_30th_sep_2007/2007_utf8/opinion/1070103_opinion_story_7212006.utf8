The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 POOR SHOW

 The best thing a government can do in order to promote trade and industry is to act as a catalyst. But it may be a different story if a government interferes with investors decisions. The three chief ministers of Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, who want an equitable arrangement for the use of natural resources in their states, seem to have a confused notion of the governments role in shaping business decisions. True, the three states have remained poor and backward despite having large deposits of coal, iron ore, aluminium and other natural resources. It is also a valid argument that the states should benefit from industrial and other enterprises that thrive on the regions resources. The scrapping of the freight equalization policy, which had long been opposed by the coal-producing states, was an admission of the validity of this argument. It is another matter, though, if such investors are forced to locate their production units in the states where they collect their raw material. Such a move will neither work nor will it be advisable. The source of raw material is important to an industrial enterprise, but it is not the only factor shaping an investors decision about the location of the venture. 

 That the Centre too wants a holistic approach to such issues was underscored by its decision to set up the Hoda committee. Although the committee examined the mineral development policy in general, it did not go into the sharing of resources between the states and the Centre. The issue has acquired an urgency since the mining sector was opened to the private sector. The Hoda committees recommendation places national interest above the states requirements. Naturally, the eastern states, where the countrys largest iron ore deposits are located, are not happy with it. But the states and the Centre should leave it to the market forces to decide on the best use of natural resources. Letting a hundred businesses bloom is a better way to battle the regions poverty.

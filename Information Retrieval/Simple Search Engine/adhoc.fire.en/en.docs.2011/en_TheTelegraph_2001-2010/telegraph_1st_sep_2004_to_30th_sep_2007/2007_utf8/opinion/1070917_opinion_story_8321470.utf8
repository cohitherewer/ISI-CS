 SHALLOW TALENT POOL

 GWYNNE DYER

 FIFTH COLUMN

 Its been 62 years since Japan surrendered to the United States of America at the end of World War II, and many things have changed, but not Japans subordination to the US. Despite having the worlds second biggest economy, Japan is still a pigmy on the international stage.

 It is the deeply conflicted views of the Japanese about their foreign policy that have brought down Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after less than a year in office. His Liberal Democratic Party still has a majority in the lower house of parliament and will choose a successor from its own ranks on September 22, but this may mark the end of the LDPs half-century monopoly on power.

 In his resignation speech, Abe explained that he was quitting to pave the way for ruling and opposition parties to work together to approve Tokyos naval mission in support of the US-led operation in Afghanistan. The mission, which ends on November 1 unless the parliament renews it, is one of the ways that the LDP slides past the prohibitions of the peace constitution and deploys Japans armed forces abroad.

 It is a pretty modest deployment, as it only involves Japanese destroyers and tankers refuelling US warships in the Indian Ocean that are supporting the US-led war in Afghanistan. But even with Abe gone, the parliament will not renew the mission. A few weeks ago, the LDP lost control of the upper house, and all the opposition parties oppose an extension.

 So the LDP will probably let the anti-terrorist mission in the Indian-Ocean end after next month. It has bigger problems to contend with, starting with the paucity of credible candidates to replace Abe as prime minister. Taro Aso, the front-runner, is scarcely house-broken. As foreign minister, he observed that American diplomats would never solve the problems of the Middle East because they had blue eyes and blonde hair. As economics minister, he said that he wanted to make Japan a country where rich Jews would want to live. His favourite conversational topic is manga comic books.

 Playing at odds

 The main claim to fame of Asos principal rival, Yasuo Fukuda, is that his father, Takeo, was prime minister. That represents the LDPs biggest problem: political in-breeding at the top, and the consequent shallowness of its pool of talent. 

 Since the beginning of this decade, moreover, the LDP has fallen into the hands of a narrow group of politicians whose goal is to roll back the changes introduced in Japan during the American occupation. They want to promote nationalism in the schools to rescue young people who have no dreams, as Abe put it and to change the pacifist constitution that forbids Japan to send troops abroad.

 Some of this plays well with the Japanese public, but the slavish loyalty that the LDP hawks display towards the US alliance does not. It is strangely at odds with the nationalist tone of their rhetoric, and it leads them into actions that alienate the public. One recent example was Abes attempt to force Okinawa to accept the construction of a new military complex for US forces. As a result, the LDP was heavily defeated in Okinawa in the July elections for the upper house.

 In the past, the LDP has always managed to bounce back after political setbacks, but the rise of the right-wing hawks in the party may change that pattern. Moreover, the perennially unsuccessful left-wing parties are no longer the only alternative. The Democratic Party, a centrist grouping created ten years ago by dissident LDP members and various independents, has become the second-largest party and a plausible alternative government

 The drift towards a rearmed Japan with a much more assertive foreign policy has seemed unstoppable in recent years, but the LDP hawks may have overreached themselves. The LDP may even end up spending some years in opposition, which would do it a world of good.

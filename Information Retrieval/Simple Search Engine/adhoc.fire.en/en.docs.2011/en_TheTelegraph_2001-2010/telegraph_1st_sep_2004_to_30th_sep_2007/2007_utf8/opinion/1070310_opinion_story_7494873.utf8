 FOREVER BARBIE

 Her full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. She was an instant hit at the American International Toy Fair in New York on March 9, exactly 48 years ago. There is something bizarre about Barbie approaching her middle years. She came into this world as a teenage fashion model in a black-and-white, zebra-stripe swimsuit and topknot ponytail (with a choice of blonde or brunette). She has morphed since into a dazzling range of ethnic types (African, Hispanic, West Asian, Gay Parisienne) and more than 500 professional makeovers (astronaut, flight-attendant, vet, police officer, dentist, She-Ra, the Princess of Power). We girls can do anything! she declares in her 1984 slogan. But it is impossible to imagine a Hot-Flushes-and-Mood-Swings Barbie, or a Cellulite-and-HRT Barbie. Ms Roberts, with her PVC head and plastic body, has escaped all of Eves curses. Doll, cult-object and fetish, she is both in and out of time.

 But the most sublimely synthetic creature cannot dodge history. Barbie has a chequered one. She was thought up by an American, Ruth Handler, who noticed that the paper dolls made by her daughter, Barbara, were all given adult roles by their creator. Handler then went to Germany after the war, and saw there the Lilli Doll. Lilli was a sex-toy for adults, modelled on a German, working-class, cartoon character who was a bit of a hooker hanging out with balding, jowly fatcats, as Barbies biographer puts it. Handler passed her idea on to her husband, who owned a toy company, Mattel, Inc. She then teamed up with an engineer, Jack Ryan, to design the first doll, giving it her daughters name. (Ryan used to design Sparrow and Hawk missiles for Pentagon, and was briefly married to Zsa Zsa Gabor.) After Barbies New York debut, Mattel sold 350,000 dolls in the first year. Barbie, together with her boyfriend, family, friends, pets, accessories, books and video games, is now a $1.7 billion-a-year industry. Mattel claims that two Barbies are sold every second. A clash of civilizations is now on between Barbie and her Arab counterpart, Fulla. She comes with her prayer-mat and hijab in Fulla Pink, is honest, loving and caring and respects her mother and father, and has no Ken. (Ruth Handler, with a penchant for family romance, named him after her son.) The clash continues today with Barbies main American contender, the Bratz doll, being launched by an immigrant from, of all countries, Iran. And like most icons, Barbie has spawned a whole range of subversive doubles: the Gangsta Bitch Barbie, the Food Chain Barbie (in a blender), and the Dungeon Barbie (in bondage gear).

 Why is Barbie good? As one of her American collectors, in her 40s, explains, I cant afford a Versace. But my Barbie can. And I can imagine myself wearing it. And why is Barbie bad? Ohio-born Cindy Jackson, now living in London, is afflicted with what has been called the Barbie Syndrome. She has spent around $100,000 on cosmetic surgery in order to have Barbies plastic body. But plastic needs no plastic surgeon. All women should aspire to the condition of plastic.

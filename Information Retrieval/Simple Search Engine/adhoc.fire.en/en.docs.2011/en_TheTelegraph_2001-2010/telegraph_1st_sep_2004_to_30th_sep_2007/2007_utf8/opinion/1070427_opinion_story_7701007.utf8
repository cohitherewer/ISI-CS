 Turbulent times

 Sir It is strange that on the one hand, a Bangladeshi court called Sheikh Hasina Wajed an absconder and ordered her to surrender, while on the other, she was prevented from boarding a flight home on the advice of the interim government (Heathrow drama grounds Hasina, April 23). The decision to stall Wajeds return was contrary to the judicial ruling. Perhaps, this goaded the government to reconsider the decision and lift the ban on Wajeds return. If the Bangladeshi government wishes to cleanse the system by trying to rid the country of politicians, it would be setting a very bad precedent. The interim government has promised to hold elections by the end of next year. But its autocratic mode of functioning raises doubts about its real intentions. Worse, the government seems to be in no mood to either improve the situation in Bangladesh or mend its ties with India. 

 However, there is no need to give up hope just yet. Fakhruddin Ahmed, the head of the interim government, has done the right thing by letting Wajed come back. This will enable Wajed to defend her self against the charges that have been levelled against her. Hopefully, Ahmed will be able to facilitate Bangladeshs return to democratcy in the near future.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir Bangladesh has a long history of military rule. The caretaker government of the country, which enjoys the support of the army, is beginning to emulate the present dispensation of Pakistan. It must be said that the caretaker government has been doing a commendable job since it took over the reins of the country. Politicians, business magnets and VVIPs synonymous with corruption have been pulled up and put behind bars. Currently, a road map is being put in place to ensure free and fair elections in the country. During its tenure, the interim government has had its share of problems as well. The country has been a witness to violent outbreaks of late. Many prominent leaders have also been threatened with exile. 

 Significantly, India does not stand to gain by unrest in Bangladesh. Moreover, instability in a neighbouring country increases the chances of infiltration, compromising internal security on on this side of the border. Under the circumstances, the Indian government should put pressure on Fakhruddin Ahmed to act upon his promise to restore democracy at the earliest.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Wedded many times over

 Sir Politicians have often been accused of flouting the law of the land. Therefore, the revelation that some politicians in Narendra Modis Gujarat have married more than once does not really come as a surprise. After all, Modi has managed to remain in power in Gujarat despite lending covert support to a pogrom against the minority community some years back. It is time ordinary Indians resigned themselves to the fact that the country will continue to be ruled by a set of people who have made a serious compromise with their conscience. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir The report, Modis merry men (April 23), was amusing. In my opinion, polygamy should be legalized across the world. Polygamy has been practised by Christians, Jews, Muslims, as well as by Hindus, at different times. Marriage is a private affair. Hence, there is no need to criticize polygamy as long as it is taking place among consensual adults. 

 Yours faithfully,

James A. Marples, Texas, US

 Towering ugliness

 Sir I live in a nine-storeyed building on Alipore Park Road. The area between this and Burdwan Road is already congested with highrises. Some of the buildings are taller than the one in which we live. Mercifully, all these years, a sizeable green patch had been left untouched, despite the overcrowding. However, with the property changing hands recently, this patch is now making way to a tower which is already twenty-storey high. I understand that eight more storeys are going to be added to it. This monstrosity unavoidably raises some very pertinent questions: should such an unpardonable assault on greenery be permitted? Should such high towers be allowed to be built in areas that are already densely populated? 

 How is this project affecting this area? The noise-producing activities such as cutting tiles, carpentry work, laying concealed electric wires and so on are already adding to the existing levels of pollution. Perhaps, such towers should only be allowed in specially earmarked zones such as the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and thereabouts, where there are plenty of open spaces and water bodies. And what about the critical factor of depleting underground water levels? One wonders who among the municipal authorities is responsible for giving permission to this particular project. One also wonders whether there is some truth in the allegation that the city administration prioritizes the interests of promoters and not of citizens. Many people in our immediate neighbourhood not only share my concern but also shudder to think about the full impact of the sudden arrival of a tall, ugly building on our otherwise quiet existence in a corner of south-west Alipore.

 Yours faithfully,

Paritosh Sen, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RULE OF THE WRONG 

 Malvika Singh

 Mala Fide

 Something strange has overtaken 

 life in India. It is as though integrity and decency have 

 been thrown to the winds, with no national leader, from 

 top to bottom and from any political dispensation, willing 

 to stand up and call a spade a spade. Wherever you look, 

 and whichever way you choose to look at what is happening, 

 it is wrong, illegal and illegitimate. In the year of the 

 60th anniversary of our independence from alien rule, all 

 we have to showcase is criminality, anarchy, corruption 

 and ineptitude of governance.

 The sealing of allegedly illegal 

 operations, doing business without the requisite permissions 

 and at venues that are not deemed for commercial use, is 

 by no means a cleansing of corrupt practices. Instead, this 

 exercise has opened many more avenues for making illegitimate 

 and illegal money through bribery and other corruption. 

 Authorities are tied up with land mafias and builders who 

 are in turn controlling the law-enforcement brigades. Political 

 personages are involved as well. This is known and recognized 

 by those in power, across all parties. They are silent. 

 And that ominous silence has endorsed the continuation and 

 enhancement of corruption, victimizing those who are honest 

 and have all the necessary papers. 

 A recent report of a policeman 

 having sold an illegal property to an unsuspecting person, 

 and the consequences thereof, makes for scary reading. A 

 plea to overrun this illegal transaction consciously executed 

 by a government servant to dupe an innocent buyer has 

 allegedly met with stony silence from the top brass of the 

 service. Protection of criminality? This is merely one example 

 of government servants getting caught in nefarious and illegal 

 activities, and being exonerated. This symbol of malafide 

 governance needs immediate correction. To suspend such 

 officers who break the rule, would probably reduce the number 

 of people in the service to a handful!

 Obscenity abounds

 The fake encounter that has 

 hogged the headlines this week exposes once again what is 

 well known; but no national leader has addressed the nation 

 to damn this horror with a promise to reduce criminality 

 in our public space. The nexus is closing its ranks, only 

 to survive the public onslaught for a short while longer. 

 It is frightening.

 Then there is the Richard Gere/Shilpa 

 Shetty saga. Does it make sense to issue an arrest warrant 

 for the offence committed by Gere, of kissing a consenting, 

 adult woman in the land of the Kamasutra? Does an 

 act of affection merit this madness? Kissing is obscene, 

 but murder, rape, eve-teasing, physical assault are socially 

 acceptable! Mera Bharat mahaan. Arrest, imprison, 

 harass, torment those who spread love, but allow those who 

 kill and rape, steal and plan fake encounters, to walk free. 

 Satyameva jayate. Colonial laws continue to overwhelm 

 and suffocate free, democratic, secular India and unfortunately, 

 our rulers look on, silent and non-committal.

 Is it obscene when Indian men 

 unbutton their flies to urinate in full public view on the 

 streets of this nation? Or, is that seen as something pure, 

 clean and fetching? Why have there been no obscenity charges 

 against the hundreds of thousands of middle-class men who 

 bare their privates and contaminate the environment that 

 belongs to us all? Where are the authorities supposed to 

 enforce the law? Or do they too use India to pee upon? 

 And, how about bringing charges 

 of obscenity and issuing arrest warrants on all the stars 

 of Bollywood for their truly obscene gyrations that have 

 no bearing on the storyline of their films? And again, why 

 not book those crude individuals in public life who abuse 

 their political opponents from public rostrums?

 The hypocrisy is sick-making, 

 and the silence on these events from the powers that be 

 is even more disturbing.

 RAINING CATS AND DOGS 

 Stephen Hugh Jones

 WORDCAGE

 Two weeks ago, I turned a beady 

 eye on clichs; phrases like grim determination. 

 With cheerful determination, I revert to these unhappy, 

 worn-out creatures, but to an especially unhappy variety 

 of them, clichs whose original form never meant anything 

 much; words like a beady eye, for instance. 

 The meaning of that phrase is 

 clear enough: I examined clichs closely and disapproved 

 of them. But what on earth is a beady eye? One whose pupil 

 looks like the hole through a bead? Perhaps, but then so 

 does the pupil of any eye, not merely one that is taking 

 a close and hostile look at something. If the literal meaning 

 of some clich doesnt make much sense, you are usually 

 wise to avoid it.

 English has many such phrases, 

 old and new. British estate agents love to advertise the 

 house they are selling as deceptively spacious. What 

 they mean is that its rooms look tiny but really arent 

 (which in reality usually means that they are). Likewise 

 the agent may say that the house boasts this or that 

 feature. Houses boast, do they? Since when? And, by the 

 way, since when does one boast something rather than 

 of something? All the agent means is that the house 

 has the feature concerned and it is a good one (or, in the 

 clich that he and I, alas would be likelier to use, 

 it is a plus point).

 Cheap thrills

 Cheap romantic fiction offers 

 other such clichs. One can hardly blame its authors for 

 falling lyrically flat over their heroines: true poets, 

 novelists and lovers have spent centuries dreaming up adjectives 

 and analogies for the beauty of women, so the modern hack 

 can be pardoned if his chosen phrases are both unoriginal 

 and empty. But the men! For heavens sake, just what are, 

 say, chiselled features? The writer probably means 

 that they are clear-cut and prominent, but then any competent 

 sculptor can just as well chisel features that are soft 

 and rounded.

 We hurried journalists are fond 

 of the empty clich, often one jokingly cobbled together 

 from two different contexts. My local weekly loves the headline 

 Blooming Marvellous. Yes, you guessed: groan, groan, 

 its writing about some flower show. Pressure groups like 

 to lament that they want a level playing-field when 

 they claim some competitor is getting an unfair advantage. 

 As it stands, the phrase is meaningful enough. But in its 

 implication, that an unlevel playing-field is unfair, its 

 nonsense: level or unlevel, like the notoriously sloping 

 pitch at Lords, any ground is equally so for both sides.

 Negating negatives

 Some clichs are half-truths, 

 at times deliberately so: caught in the crossfire 

 almost always means we saw some civilians so we shot 

 them. A few proclaim flat falsehoods. Most proverbial 

 sayings, by now, are pretty hackneyed, but they are also 

 usually true. Its a fact that a bad workman blames his 

 tools or that you can take a horse to water but you 

 cant make it drink. But what about 

 this? Before the Iraq war, when the UN inspectors couldnt 

 find if Saddam had any weapons of mass destruction, the 

 neocons and their chelas in the media loved to argue 

 that that didnt prove he had none, because you cant 

 prove a negative. Really not? I can prove conclusively 

 that my hair is not black: just take a look at it.

 Both weasel-word clichs and plain 

 nonsense are best avoided. But no one can steer clear of 

 all clichs, even if their status as such is obvious, which 

 often it is not. And I confess to liking one that is pure 

 absurdity. When the monsoon breaks, how do you describe 

 the rainfall? When theres so heavy a downpour in England, 

 we say its raining cats and dogs. Id be happy to 

 learn readers favourite clichs or their least-favourite.

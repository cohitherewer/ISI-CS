 RIVER PHOENIX

 GANGA By Julian Crandall Hollick, Random House, Rs 450

 The next time you admire the Kanpur leather handbag your friend is carrying, spare a thought for the Ganga. The untreated chromium waste from the tanneries of Kanpur has been polluting the river almost beyond repair. If it is hexavalent chromium in Kanpur, it is plastic and biological waste elsewhere, along with sewage and decomposing flesh of humans and animals. Julian Crandall Hollick is troubled by the question: How can Indians pollute Ganga yet at the same time worship her as a goddess? By the time he comes to the end of his journey down the Ganga, the author has realized that it is precisely the faith in the rivers divinity that encourages people to carry on polluting it. After all, a goddess knows how to shake off the muck and emerge pure!

 Not faith alone, there is also the bacteriophage Gangeticum, a helpful bacterium that destroys most forms of germs in the river water. D.S. Bhargava, a retired professor of hydrology, is, however, convinced that it is the Mysterious Factor X (which could well be the Gangas extraordinary rate of re-oxygenation) that makes gangajal so pure, so that no one ever has dysentery or cholera from drinking it. Readers are entitled to wonder: but dont rivers as ecosystems have their own mechanisms to flush out impurities? What is the big deal about the Ganga?

 The big deal is that the Ganga in a way explains the ways of India and Indians. In Kanpur, the polluted Ganga water, flowing through irrigation canals, has devastated crop yield and afflicted thousands with skin and gastro-enteric diseases. But the affected are quite willing to blame nuclear radiation (of which they understand little or nothing) rather than the poison-spewing tanneries (which they can see with their own eyes ) for their woes. In the ghats in Varanasi and Kanpur, thousands of bodies are cremated and the remains disposed of in the river while the electric crematoria remain firmly padlocked. The permitted limits adopted under the Ganga Action Plan for levels of arsenic, Dissolved Oxygen and Biological Oxygen Demand are higher or lower (as the case may be) than globally accepted WHO limits, lest Indians get agitated to learn how endangered they are.

 The crowning paradox is to be witnessed in Malda and Murshidabad in West Bengal, where the government spends crores creating embankments when all it needs to do is stop meddling in the natural course of the river. The colossal blunder that was the building of the Farakka barrage is being paid for by hapless villagers whose houses and lands are being gobbled up at great speed by the hungry river only to emerge on the other side. But that is another state, another political domain where the owners of lost land have no rights. And thus carry on the tales of institutional failure and human arrogance, which shape the ailing Ganga and the growing India. 

 Hollick does succeed in studying the Ganga holistically, though he is decidedly better at scientific and economic discussions than with matters of mythology and faith. But a book of this stature demands much more carefulness and thorough fact-checking from both the author and the copy-editors. Hollick and his mates could not have travelled on a Mahendra Scorpio, nor could they have heard Ganga Lahiri (lahari perhaps?) or vaviyas (bhawaiyas?), or learnt about a district in Bengal called Birbhaum. Repeating the end-lines of a page in the next, or spelling a name in multiple ways (Sunderlal Bahaguna/ Bahugana) are inexcusable too. These would only make Indian readers brand Hollick as an outsider, though his awareness and scholarship are greater than that of those who pay obeisance to the Ganga annually.

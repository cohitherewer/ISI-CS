The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 EMPTY HOUSE

 Those who slug it out on the streets display a level of education that is very familiar to Indians. It is part of the national news every day, whether in the papers or on television. Indias members of parliament, especially those in the Lok Sabha, feel comfortable within the House only when they can turn it into an extension of the street, or at least a substitute for the violent arena where political parties fight each other for ascendancy, indifferent to the existence of reason, or responsibility, or even a future beyond the bloody nose immediately within the reach of ones arm. It is not so much anger as dismay and frustration that find expression in the disturbed, and disturbing, statements of the Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, on the occasion of the unscheduled and indefinite adjournment of parliament after a series of disruptions that prevented discussion of even the most urgent issues and bills. Legislators, whichever party they belong to, behaved consistently as if they had forgotten that they were elevated to parliament as the fit representatives of people who voted for them, that it is their job to think about the country as a whole and about what is best for its people, instead of blindly lunging out at other parties and holding the House to ransom. The fact that the crisis came this time over an agreement that the parliament is not empowered to call the shots on makes the deterioration of parliamentary culture all the more stark.

 The concept of parliamentary debate, its crucial importance in directing the affairs of the State, the weight and dignity of the parliamentary process seem to have, over the last six or seven years, become part of ancient memory. The decline of parliamentary culture is really the symptom of something far more dangerous the irrelevance of parliament to Indias political life. There is as much sheer ignorance as deliberately disruptive intention behind this decline. That legislators nowadays come from all strata of society is an indicator of the health of a growing democracy. But access to the House should also mean access to the knowledge that would help new MPs make best use of the House. An institutionally supported educational programme for MPs has become essential if the parliament is to function. Not that this would solve all the problems that plague parliament today, but it might help substantially in improving both its atmosphere and its functioning.

 WHEN AILING BODY LOOKS FOR CURE

 Indian doctors are no longer welcome in Britain, but NHS is outsourcing clerical jobs to India. Sreyashi Dastidar looks at the changing scenario

 On the wronged side

 Deepa, a young Indian medical graduate, comes to the United Kingdom for a short-term fellowship at a National Health Service hospital. Here she discovers the comforts of Western lifestyle and of an organized medical service. Happier still, she meets and falls in love with a British doctor of Asian origin. But her fellowship soon comes to an end, and she finds herself facing issues that impossibly tangle her personal life with her professional aspirations. 

 This is the storyline of Bhavishya The Future, a film made in 2006 by Nikhil Kaushik, a British-Indian ophthalmologist attached to the Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales. 

 Rakesh Salujas story, however, has no make-believe element in it. He had gone to the UK as a young, ambitious doctor in the Eighties. Those were the days of permit-free employment. But soon, the system of limited registration was introduced. This meant that an overseas doctor, after clearing the Professional and Linguistics Assessment Boards examination, could only study in the UK for four years. Thankfully, Saluja had got married to his classmate in medical college before leaving India. Before his four years ran out, his wife cleared PLAB and applied to the NHS. But once her tenure too neared its end, the Salujas found themselves running from pillar to post to get appointed as consultants or at least have their stay extended. Thanks to the dearth of specialists in the UK at the time, both husband and wife managed to get appointed as consultants. But neither has forgotten the days and weeks of uncertainty and despair. 

 In March 2006, the British parliament approved a set of new immigration rules upheld by the high court in February 2007 which would make it almost impossible for non-European Union doctors to enter and work for the NHS. As many as 16,000 doctors from India were thrown into severe uncertainty, specially after their umbrella organization, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, lost the case in the high court on February 9.

 Bowling for NHS

 The first wave of immigration of Indian doctors to the UK happened in the mid-Sixties. Enoch Powell, the British health minister then, was desperately seeking low-cost solutions to the NHSs crisis of skilled physicians (as opposed to general practitioners). In India, on the other hand, doctors particularly in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras were getting increasingly disenchanted with the system, which treated them shabbily and spared no thought for the upgradation of hospitals. 

 Hari Prasad Ray was among many who took up offers from British hospitals promising better wages and advanced training. For Ray, it was also an escape from the dreary life as a refugee from East Bengal in Calcutta. Britain treated Ray and his fellow immigrants well. We had free accommodation with heating, generous free meals at the hospital canteen, and, the functioning of an average NHS hospital was such a welcome change from the red-tape-and-corruption-bound affairs in our best government hospitals, he says. 

 Not everybody found themselves landed in Utopia, though. Julia Foot discovered some horror stories while making her documentary film, From Raj to Rhondda, for the BBC in 2004. For starters, the doctors who joined the NHS from India and other third-world countries would mostly be pushed to either the poorest GP practices or into the so-called Cinderella disciplines geriatric and community medicine, accidents and emergencies, psychiatry, orthopaedics and the like. A qualified cardiac surgeon could well be put in the department of community medicine, while, as Foot puts it, the British doctors got all the plum jobs. Banani, Rays radiologist wife who joined the NHS in 1976 and met her future husband some years later, recalls that Indian doctors were reputed for their no-complaints attitude. Many would rather go without their rightful holiday money an allowance they could claim in lieu of vacation than pick a fuss with the authorities. 

 It is convenient to use the well-worn theory of racial discrimination here, since it is easy to find accounts of British patients refusing to be examined by Asian doctors. But it must be remembered that in many places, the British were seeing people of a different skin colour for the first time: These strangely named doctors Krishnamurthis, Bhattacharyas and Bodiwalas astonished many people in the coal mining areas of Wales, because so far the only black faces they had seen were those of miners coming out of the coal pits. It was in these areas that Indian doctors truly made their mark, so much so that by the mid-Eighties, they were being considered the backbone of the NHS. 

 Advantage India

 Most Indian doctors with a few years of NHS experience agree that they are good value for the British governments and taxpayers money. Not only do they have what Foot calls excellent English, but they are also a pliant lot. Doctors from the rest of Europe either speak bad English or crib about their accommodation or working hours, or all of the above. Besides, medicine is taken up by only a few of Britains, and Europes, best students, making Asian GPs and surgeons much sought-after.

 In Britain, however, a few changes in the system were introduced in the late Seventies. Seats were nearly doubled in medical schools, with more seats than before being reserved for girls. The results started coming a few years later also the period which saw one of the heaviest exodus of Indian doctors and medical students to Britain. To get out of a sticky situation, the clause of limited registration was imposed on overseas doctors. But hospitals were allowed to appeal to the Home Office for the permanent appointment of an overseas doctor if they found it difficult to replace his skills with British or European physicians. Several doctors from India, such as the Salujas, have had this corollary invoked in their favour. 

 A government document leaked in January this year said that by 2011, there would be 3,200 British doctors with specialist training that the NHS cannot afford to employ. This, undoubtedly, is a fallout of the changes in the British medical education infrastructure and the influx of third-world doctors.

 Under pressure 

 The consolidation of the European Union made matters worse for the NHS. By the Nineties, Britain had a politically influential Asian population, which neither Tories nor Labour could afford to ignore. The enormity of the European pressure can be gauged from the fact that the Labour government risked upsetting its Asian vote bank in bringing in the new immigration laws. 

 According to NHS insiders, the British health system, already in a great deal of trouble, stands to lose in two ways by succumbing to EU pressure. First, there will be an influx of more unskilled and less expert professionals from the EU countries. Second, these doctors cannot be persuaded to work more than the stipulated 48 hours per week soon to be reduced to 40 hours. 

 Illness abounding

 As if the recruitment problems were not enough, the NHS was plagued by other systemic disorders too. Complaints include long wait for appointment, unsafe maternity and sexual health services, and lack of care towards patients with infectious diseases. Ironically, many patients are choosing to travel to India for surgeries and treatment. 

 At the same time that the new immigration laws were announced, the NHS decided to outsource a bulk of its clerical jobs to agencies in India. In another development, the Appollo Hospitals Group was asked to bid for four areas in the UK where it could set up diagnostic services. Thus, one the one hand, Indian doctors were being threatened with eviction, and on the other, NHS jobs were being outsourced to India and Indian hospitals invited to set up shop in Britain. Globalization at work, perhaps?

 Home fire

 It would be a mistake to think that the doctors in trouble across the seas enjoy the wholehearted support of their compatriots in India. Many doctors in India feel that the healthcare scenario in the country is dismal because most of their fellow doctors are always looking out for appointments abroad.

 Postscript: BAPIO obtained an emergency injunction on March 4 against the new recruitment restrictions, although the department of health had already stalled their implementation. Indian doctors in Britain have finally let out a sigh of relief. But how long before they feel persecuted again?

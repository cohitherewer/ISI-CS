 DISTURBED AREA

 Revenge and vendetta are always a never-ending process until the State intervenes to stop the violence and the suffering. In Nandigram, even after the government of West Bengal has announced that there will be no land acquisition, and that a special economic zone will not be built in the area, there are thousands of people who are unable to return to their homes. They had to flee late last year when they were attacked by those opposed to land acquisition. The narrative of violence should not be reduced to the otiose question of who cast the first stone. The origin of the violence is perhaps lost in the epoch when the Communist Party of India first established dominance in the rural world of West Bengal. The recent episodes of homelessness and escalation of violence can be more easily dated to early January when the dispute over land acquisition first reared its ugly head in Nandigram. Attempts by the homeless, most of whom belong to the CPI(M), to return to their homes first with the armed protection of party cadre and then with the help of the police have proved to be futile and violent. It is clear that in Nandigram, large groups of people, aided and abetted by various political parties and groups, are in the possession of arms, which they are also trained to use. The vicious cycle of violence has paralyzed normal life, made administration non-existent and the sway of the rule of law, at best, tenuous. The State cannot allow such a situation to continue indefinitely. People have to return to their homes and the administration must be allowed to function. 

 The fact that land will no longer be acquired in Nandigram has made the protest of the Bhumi Uchchhed Pratirodh Committee completely irrelevant. What it is fighting now is an unseemly turf battle. It is unwilling to allow CPI(M) supporters and workers to come back to their homes. The only way to resolve the impasse is for Nandigram to be labelled a disturbed area. This will enable the state to deploy, with the help of the Centre, para-military forces that would carry out combing operations in the area to recover arms, irrespective of the political affiliations of the possessors of those arms. The government of West Bengal should move immediately towards declaring Nandigram to be a disturbed area. The State should act to restore the rule of law in Nandigram.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Living for food

 THE CALCUTTA KITCHEN (Mitchell 

 Beazeley, 20) brings together recipes (written up by the 

 London-based Bengali chef, Udit Sarkhel), beautiful photographs 

 (by Jason Lowe) of the making, selling and eating of food 

 in the city, and varied, affectionate accounts of food as 

 a cosmopolitan way of life in Calcutta by Simon Parkes of 

 The Food Programme on BBC Radio 4 . Parkes writes as an 

 insider to Bengali domestic life across the entire social 

 spectrum, making his account of food a way into the rich 

 and bewildering muddle of life in Calcutta. His eye for 

 the human or historical detail is sensitively realized by 

 Lowes camera. There are separate chapters on home cooking, 

 fish, vegetables, Islamic cuisine, Park Street, street food, 

 Bengali sweets and the local festivities and rituals. Since 

 Sarkhel introduces himself as a Bengali, he ought to have 

 known that mustard sauce is not khashundi but kashundi, 

 and the Bengali for she-goat is not pathar.

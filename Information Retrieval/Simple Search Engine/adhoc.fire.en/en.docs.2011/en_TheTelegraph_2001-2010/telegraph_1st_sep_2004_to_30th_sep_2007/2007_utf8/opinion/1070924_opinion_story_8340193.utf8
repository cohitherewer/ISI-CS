 God as engineer

 Sir M. Karunanidhi has not only described Ram as a mythological character but also wondered which engineering college he attended in order to have the expertise to build a bridge. Karunanidhi may have questioned the existence of Ram, but he has no right to offend Hindu religious sentiments with his sarcasm. The historicity of Ram is a matter of faith and, thus, not bound by logic or scientific evidence. Such faith is a characteristic feature of all religions, not just Hinduism. For instance, many people blindly believe the biblical stories of Moses parting the Red Sea or of a virgin giving birth. 

 It could be argued too that the engineering marvels of the ancient world were the creations of people who hardly had any technical degree in architecture or civil engineering. Even then, Karunanidhis modern engineers have not been able to produce anything close to engineering feats such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon or the Great Wall of China. Besides, names of rulers are associated with technical and artistic creations of their age, though the king himself never participated in the actual construction. The Taj Mahal is a case in point. While admiring the Taj Mahal, do we ask after Shah Jahans engineering skills? Similarly, Rams name is simply associated with the bridge. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams brand of politics has been irrelevant to Tamils for a long time. No Indian Tamil in his right senses still wishes for a Tamil nation as the DMK, in the heyday of Periyar and C.N. Annadurai, had called for. Nor is the overthrow of Brahmin dominance in Tamil society a political motivator, given the Dravidian movements reversal of the caste equations in Tamil Nadu. In this context, M. Karunanidhi should remember that Tamils remain a god-loving and god-fearing people. He and his brood may be atheists, but one would find it difficult to come across too many of this kind in Tamil society. It is true that Ram is viewed by most Dravidians as an alien and Aryan figure and Tamil Hindus do not subscribe to the sangh parivar brand of Hinduism. Nevertheless, Karunanidhi should think twice before going too far in playing the anti-Hindu card. Besides, had the sentiments of Muslims or Christians been hurt, Karunanidhi would have been the first to cry foul.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Archaeological Survey of India has claimed that the Ramar Sethu is not man-made. The ASI is correct since it was made by god. The ASI knows that nothing is man-made, since nothing can be made without the help of air, water, wind, fire and earth. Humanity admires things made by man, but worships things evidently made by powers far superior to man. The significance of Ram is thus symbolic. Chanting his name has lent strength and peace of mind to millions of young and old people. The DMK chief, M. Karunanidhi, may question the historicity of Ram but that is altogether beside the point. Let us proceed with the Sethusamudram project and dredge the Ramar Sethu. But let us not jeopardize our peace by fighting over the existence of Ram. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir M. Karunanidhi perhaps believes that being the chief minister of a state gives him the right to hurt the sensibilities of millions. He should have desisted from basing his caustic remarks on the DMKs original ideology of being anti-Hindu and anti-north India. One only need recall Periyars vitriolic attitude and Karunanidhis attack on Hindus praying by rivers or the sea almost 50 years ago. Certain things have been dictated by faith for thousands of years and thus should not be questioned. The DMKs partner, the Congress, should remember that M.K. Gandhi himself was a devotee of Ram. Therefore, the Congress and the United Progressive Alliance had better look in the mirror before disrespecting Ram. Just as adherents should restrain themselves from imposing their faith on the unwilling, similarly, atheists like Karunanidhi should keep their tongue in check. Unfortunately, the DMK chief is not only an atheist but also a veteran political muscleman. By acting irresponsibly, he has unsettled the country and exposed it to further violence. 

 However, vandalizing the house of Karunanidhis daughter and burning buses in Karnataka will not harm Karunanidhi. Such actions harm our country, its people and damage public property. Instead, Indians need to do something to prevent such politicians from getting elected. There should also be a means of blacklisting irresponsible netas. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir To go by the old adage, the gods indeed make mad those they wish to destroy. Karunanidhis questioning of the very existence of Ram only shows his madness born out of arrogance and power. His days, and possibly the DMKs too, are numbered. Karunanidhis attitude is similar to that of talibans when it destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas. Taliban incidentally was removed from power in Afghanistan soon after.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The affidavit has been withdrawn, the Union government has apologized and the law minister has affirmed that Lord Ram exemplifies the ethos of India. Why then is the Ramar Sethu issue not moving out of the front pages? Obviously, rationalists take Hindus for granted. Could M. Karunanidhi have shown disrespect for the holy figures of other communities in the way that he has done to the Hindus? This senile old man is on the verge of creating a mess the country could do without.

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya,

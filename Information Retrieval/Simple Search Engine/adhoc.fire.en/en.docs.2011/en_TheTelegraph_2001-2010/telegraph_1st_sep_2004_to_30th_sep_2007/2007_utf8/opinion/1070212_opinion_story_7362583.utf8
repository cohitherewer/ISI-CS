 ACT FASTER

 Interest in piped gas from Iran waxes and wanes with the state of Indo-Pak relations. The idea was born in the late Eighties, when India started looking out, an energy deficit loomed, and Iran was a close source of hydrocarbons. Interest died out in the early years of the United Progressive Alliances reign, when nuclear bombs captured the governments imagination and Muslim nations were seen as enemies. Then, as Mr Pervez Musharraf put on a friendly mask, interest again revived in 2003. Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar, the UPA governments first petroleum minister, was keen on the pipeline. But the prime minister moved closer to the United States of America and removed Mr Aiyar; that put paid to talk of the pipeline. Now Indo-Pak relations are on the mend, and talk of the pipeline is being heard again in Delhi.

 On this issue, the prime ministers words are the most relevant. He has been at pains to stress that his close relations with Washington do not rule out closer relations with Iran. But he was sceptical that bankers could be found to finance the pipeline. Its cost was around $5 billion on the last valuation, which is quite old; today the sum may be a good deal higher. In view of the tetchy relationship between India and Pakistan, the pipeline is best funded by international financiers, who would seek and obtain assurances of good behaviour from both countries. He did not think financiers could be found; so for him, the pipeline was a non-starter.

 Gas, however, is not the only importable. Government subsidies have turned India into a bottomless pit for urea. It is demand for urea that drives the quest abroad for gas. So the government has thought of investing in urea plants to be built in gas-rich countries. But if urea is brought into the reckoning, so should other uses of gas in particular, power. No one thinks of importing power because the state electricity boards, which serve the final buyer, are in a hopeless financial mess, and no one would take their word that they can pay for power. However, the Central government awarded contracts for two so-called ultra-mega-power projects 4GW power plants and plans to give out three more. These plants are to be located in India, but the contractors may import fuel. A minor squiggle can accommodate gas from abroad: entirely foreign companies should be allowed to bid for the projects, and location of the plants in neighbouring countries should also be allowed. That will give Pakistan an opportunity to sell electricity to India. It will have to minimize the cost of generation to succeed in bids; just what fuels it uses, and from where, would be its own business. This is the way of avoiding the interminable negotiations that go into inter-governmental gas import agreements, getting some action faster and enticing Pakistan into an amicable relationship without unacceptable risks on either side.

 ROAD TO EFFICIENCY 

 - In a market society, the government had best stick to governance 

 Dipankar Dasgupta

 Free riders 

 There are at least two reasons 

 why the government is viewed as ideally suited to the task 

 of infrastructure-creation in developing economies. First, 

 more often than not, infrastructure is bulky in nature and 

 involves lengthy periods to be produced and made operational. 

 Expected profits from infrastructure projects arrive with 

 delays that are unbearably long for entrepreneurs in developing 

 economies. In other words, the size of capital required 

 to build mass infrastructure is considerably bigger than 

 funds available to capitalists in these societies. Large 

 capital owners in developed economies can afford to wait 

 longer for their returns from infrastructural investments 

 to flow in, since they would be reaping incomes in the interim 

 period from capital sunk elsewhere. 

 The government, however, even 

 if caught in a financial tangle on account of limited tax 

 revenues, has greater credibility as a market borrower (in 

 the domestic economy as well as abroad with progressive 

 deregulation). So it has better command over resources needed 

 to build infrastructure. The rapid expansion of infrastructure 

 creates a congenial environment for a private sector-led 

 growth of the economy, since infrastructural facilities 

 are a sine qua non for business. 

 The second, and possibly more 

 important, reason underlying the private sectors reluctance 

 to build infrastructure is that the services it generates 

 are fundamentally different from those emanating from run- 

 of-the-mill commodities. To appreciate this fact, consider 

 a pair of shoes, which can serve a single individual at 

 any point of time. On the other hand, the services of roadways, 

 airports or space programmes, all examples of public infrastructure, 

 are simultaneously available to multiple users. More than 

 one pedestrian or car may travel along the same road, but 

 a pair of shoes cannot be worn by two individuals together. 

 Similarly, an entire nation can, in principle, access the 

 information beamed in by a satellite, or thousands of people 

 can be logged on to the internet through a broadband server 

 during any day. 

 This special property of infrastructural 

 services, however, lies at the root of a propensity on the 

 part of their beneficiaries to engage in free riding consuming 

 the service without paying for it. The availability of the 

 service to any one person can often ensure that others enjoy 

 it too. Who then would be willing to pay for the benefit 

 of others? On account of free riding, sales revenue and 

 profits are at stake, thus making infrastructure-production 

 unattractive. Since the government is not driven by profit 

 motives and is also in a position to police over misconduct, 

 it is unlikely to be affected by the problems that put off 

 private business. Hence, one argues that it is better placed 

 to ensure infrastructure-accumulation. 

 The idea, however, is more easily 

 proposed than implemented in a democracy. A major advantage 

 with the profit motive is that it ensures respect for productive 

 efficiency. And efficiency amounts to a reduction of cost 

 without sacrificing product quality. The government, though, 

 is by assumption unconcerned with profits and hence not 

 particularly worried about efficiency. And there exactly 

 is the rub. 

 To exemplify this, consider the 

 state government turning a blind eye to the congestion caused 

 by hawkers occupying pavements. It is an example of a class 

 of people being encouraged by the state to free ride on 

 the rest of society. A facility created with the help of 

 tax- payers money is freely handed over to petty traders 

 even as serious business initiatives are inconvenienced. 

 Despite its nuisance value, the 

 government encourages it, because the government is more 

 concerned with votes than profits. The example shows that 

 the government could be ill-suited for infrastructure-development 

 in a democratic society, precisely because it is unconcerned 

 with financial profits. 

 A second example too is linked 

 to the absence of profit motives, but is not related to 

 elections. It is the story of my personal experience with 

 the much-advertised BSNL broadband service. Amongst the 

 many attractive features of the service this government 

 organization advertises, one allows users to access the 

 BSNL server regularly to check the extent of their use of 

 the uploading and downloading facility. Since there is a 

 cap on free use in this context, subscribers benefit by 

 keeping track of their accounts. 

 In my case, however, I discovered 

 soon after the service was set up for me that I was refused 

 access to the server and had no way of viewing my account. 

 It was an uphill task to contact the BSNL officers to lodge 

 a complaint. Phone calls remained unanswered. And the few 

 times that I did manage to speak to anyone at all, I was 

 either told to speak to someone else (who would invariably 

 be untraceable), or advised that there could be a problem 

 with my computer. It was beyond their call of duty, they 

 informed me, to send someone over to look into the matter. 

 In my desperation, I landed finally in their office near 

 Lansdowne Market to speak to concerned persons. One is allowed 

 such visits only around 4 pm in the afternoon, which means, 

 amongst other things, that one cannot attend to ones regular 

 pursuits on the chosen day. 

 I requested the officer I saw 

 that I should at least be allowed to change my password, 

 since the one they assign initially to all customers (xyz 

 123) was obviously not safe to hold on to. The officer, 

 fortunately, allowed me to access their server from his 

 office and do the needful, but had no clue as to why I should 

 not be able to perform the same task sitting at home. And 

 things remained that way for almost two years. 

 Recently, I tried to install a 

 wireless router at home, but the device failed to function. 

 This time, however, I was dealing with a private organization 

 and was easily able to call up their toll-free service centre. 

 The person at the other end proved to be both helpful as 

 well as knowledgeable, a pleasant contrast to my BSNL experience. 

 She gave me instructions for more than an hour over the 

 phone around midnight and helped me not only install the 

 router but also reinstall the original BSNL modem. As soon 

 as this was done, I gleefully discovered that I was able 

 to access their server. Quite obviously, the BSNL personnel 

 had not installed their modem correctly when I had initially 

 subscribed to their service. 

 One does not require too much 

 intelligence to figure out that the absence of a profit 

 motive is what is ultimately responsible for BSNLs lackadaisical 

 attitude towards its customers. Their staff members are 

 neither competent nor responsible. They have a competitor 

 now in Airtel, which, as I am given to understand by its 

 clientele, provides acceptable back-up service. Clearly, 

 there is no reason for BSNL to survive, except for the fact 

 that it is government-owned. It exists by decree as it were, 

 not on account of the government playing a useful role in 

 infrastructure-development.

 The examples question the wisdom 

 underlying a governments participation in any productive 

 activity in a democratic society, leave alone infrastructure-development. 

 A better course of action could lie in its helping private 

 organizations raise funds to start large-scale business. 

 Some subsidization too could be necessary, for public transport 

 and related infrastructure. The associated pressures on 

 the governments budget would be nominal compared to the 

 costs of inefficiency in the existing system. 

 Instead of taking direct charge 

 of production, the government should restrict itself to 

 governance, by offering police support to the private sector 

 to prevent free riding and by improving the legal system 

 to protect the public from victimization by corrupt businessmen. 

 Needless to say, few politicians 

 in power are known to advocate such policies.

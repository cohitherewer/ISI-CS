 DEATH AND THE METROPOLIS

 A strange fatalism and lack of accountability make Calcutta the Indian city that values human life possibly the least, writes Sreyashi Dastidar

 This is the age of surveys. But one survey has not been conducted yet to find out which Indian city values human life the least. For many Calcuttans, the need for such a survey is being felt most persistently now, when we are looking back at a string of bizarre, inexplicable and entirely avoidable deaths. A young man goes to buy some milk on a lazy Sunday morning and gets killed by the flying shutter of an exploding multinational restaurant. A noble rickshaw-puller braves the water-logged streets to take a student to her examination centre and gets electrocuted because the employees of the state electricity board have left live electrical wires uncovered on the road. A child is on his way to school in a pool car when the driver rams it into a stationary bus and kills the child who does not even have the rudimentary protection of a seatbelt. A teenage girl and a young couple on a motorcycle are run over by needlessly speeding buses easily the citys most dreaded agents of death. 

 No matter how the collective consciousness of Calcutta is disturbed by such tragedies, this feeling too shall pass. Calcutta likes to believe it is unassailable. It may be defeated and bloodied from time to time, but there are always specific groups of people and authorities to blame. The ills may be crying out to be treated, but the remedies will not be initiated until a few victims have been felled. In its strange fatalism, Calcutta remains unparalleled among its peers.

 Every inch of public space and public life in Calcutta bears the stamp of this deadly mix of collective fatalism and lack of accountability. Four different irregularities (if one ignores suspicions of sabotage) have been identified as the possible causes of the explosion at the Park Street McDonalds that killed a man and injured three others. It could either have been an LPG leak, or dust trapped inside the air-conditioning ducts, or a leakage of gas from the same ducts, or the accumulation of sewerage water on the mezzanine floor of the restaurant leading to the formation of methane gas. None of these speaks of a company which adheres to the most stringent global safety standards. One might as well face the fact: the plastic trays used in a Miami McDonalds may be the same as the ones used in the Park Street outlet, but the standards of safety in the two restaurants can never be the same. No global concern is under any obligation to adopt higher safety measures for its clients and workers than its local counterparts would. In no other modern city does one see workmen painting highrise buildings and advertisement hoardings using fragile bamboo scaffolding. A few of them might fall to their death once in a while, but who is to stop the practice unless the government makes modern iron scaffoldings mandatory?

 But the government is never keen on such proactive steps. And the citizens do not demand them either, until tragedy strikes. Overcrowded and recklessly driven pool cars have been a worrying feature of our everyday lives for quite a few years now. But we the government as well as the parents who let their children travel like cattle to school needed a child to die to see what had been under our nose all along. And yes, it is no use if the victim happens to be poor and disempowered. The longish engagement of the media with the rickshaw-pullers death recently would have been unlikely if the incident had not brought a young girl a representative of the middle classes close to death by electrocution. As the social historian, Partha Chatterjee, has shown, the labourer and the rickshaw-puller are members of the population who have no inherent moral right over the welfare schemes or even the conscience of the State, unlike the girl on the rickshaw and the couple on the motorcycle who are proper citizens. Death, distress and suffering are to be worried about only when they affect people like us. And till they do, it is quite all right to continue believing that there is no real danger in breaching traffic signals, talking on the mobile phone while driving or crossing the road, using the wave of a hand to stop a moving bus anywhere, or having only one fire extinguisher in a shop when the regulation demands at least three.

 To go back to the survey yet to happen, it must study and compare the defiance shown by people in the different Indian cities. The Calcuttans love of flouting rules is writ large everywhere in the auto-driver carrying more than one passenger in front, in the car-drivers penchant for shrugging off his seatbelt, or the perverse glint in the pedestrians eye while daring a bus to run him over as he takes leisurely steps across the road. But nowhere is it better displayed than in and around the overbridges and subways in the city. The reasoning goes: why go up and down all those steps when a little sprint can see you across? The closer the approaching train or bus, the greater the pleasure derived.

 The point is that the subway at Jadavpur or Tollygunge metro station and the overbridge near NRS Medical College or Bijan Setu would not have stood so haplessly unused if they had been fitted with a device called the escalator. The lethargic Calcuttan, who would rather thread his way through unruly traffic than take the stairs, can be lured away from his dangerous game by the moving staircase. Could this simple solution have eluded the bureaucrats and ministers? Probably not. It is just too much of a bother to give people better amenities when they seem to be managing with lesser ones. Those who govern share with the governed the hope (bordering on belief) that Calcutta will somehow transform itself into a fully functional, global, post-industrial, consumerist metropolis without anyone having to work for it. When that finally happens, the deaths of rickshaw-pullers and students and working couples can be explained away as collateral damage.

 AWAY FROM SHORT-TERM GOALS

 This years budget is too strong on long-term measures for anyone to identify any political interests, writes Shubhashis Gangopadhyay

 Complicated task

 Inflation had reared its ugly head just before the budget, and the important state of Uttar Pradesh will be going to elections soon. Given that the general public does not like continual price rises, one expected this budget to go slow on anything that could heat up the economy. At the same time, people were worried that massive outlays would be made to catch the UP vote. Luckily for us, there were specific steps taken to control inflation while the UP vote did not seem to have given the finance minister any sleepless nights. In a large measure, this budget is a continuation of what was started last year stop thinking about short-term goals and concentrate on development.

 Clearly, I like the budget for its emphases on education and health, as well as on the nitty-gritty of administration. In education, there is some systematic thought on how to get children to school and keep them there. Instead of simply announcing a large number of scholarships for school- going children, the finance minister mentioned that these were only for those in classes IX till XII. Most children drop out of school during these years, and this is an excellent incentive to reverse the trend. Also, for the first time in many years, real targets have been mentioned appointment of 200,000 new teachers and the construction of 500,000 more classrooms and not simply that the allocation to education has been increased by more than 34 per cent. 

 However, one major drawback, I thought, is the lack of any plans on higher education other than increasing the allocation. The favourable interpretation is that the government plans to allow more private investment in higher education, with the government using the money committed to spend on scholarships to the needy something like an education voucher for higher studies. The less favourable interpretation is that the government has simply not thought this thing through. This is a complicated task, given the new skills and expertise required by a knowledge-based global world and the atrophy that has set in in many of our colleges and universities. Syllabi need to be changed, research activities need to increase, and more seats in higher studies need to be created. However, since higher education calls for specialization and depth, one has to give more thought to prioritizing the streams. Leaving it to the private sector, which will be driven by what allows their students to find jobs, is an obvious answer, provided every meritorious but needy student has access to these private institutions. And it is here that scholarships can be offered with the money the finance minister has set aside and with the education cess he is collecting.

 In health, the government had launched the National Rural Health Mission in 2005. The significance of this is that health is no longer seen as preventing this infection or curing that ailment. Instead, it is viewed as an integrated service that delivers healthcare. And this has obvious implications. Having a successful tuberculosis prevention programme is meaningless if people are dying of malaria. Healthy and hygienic practices, on the other hand, prevent both malaria and tuberculosis and, at the same time, increase immunity against many other infections. What is even more commendable is the realization that much of the health-service delivery can be achieved by using local resources. The employment of accredited social health activists was an innovative solution, both in terms of reach and cost. Similarly, the use of alternative and traditional systems of medicine was a great idea and this budget has increased the allocation to it by 26 per cent.

 Creating productive employment is a must for inclusive growth. Most children drop out of school because a school-leaving certificate does not guarantee any employable skills. Keeping children in school through scholarships at the secondary level is good but one needs to address the issue of their employability. The focus on the vocational institutes is, therefore, a natural thing to do and the finance minister is clearly aware of this. Significantly, he has asked for a three-way partnership among the Central government, the state government and the private sector, with full autonomy to the last who will manage these institutes.

 This brings me to the next important theme in this budget governance. The government has done some small things computerizing the public distribution system, committing resources for greater penetration of e-governance in states, setting up a body to find new ways of administering fertilizer subsidies, subsidizing employers who offer jobs to the physically challenged, and so on that will have a huge impact on how the state delivers service. Use of information technology in governance has an immediate impact; it makes corruption that much difficult. Uniformity in tax laws, similarly, reduces corruption and interest lobbies, along with moving towards a more efficient economy. These initiatives do not require a large amount of resources; it only requires commitment to good governance.

 The budget also satisfied the experts fixated on macro-management with its fiscal and revenue deficits being on target. Of course, one could point out that capital expenditures were less than budgeted for and revenue expenditures were correspondingly higher. Also, in spite of more than anticipated tax revenues and a higher-than-expected GDP growth, both these targets were just about met.

 What could have been a great budget was, however, marred a bit by the ministers decision to put on hold forward contracts in rice and wheat. Such instruments help in stabilizing prices, provided they are not stopped every time there are inflationary pressures in the general economy. This is surprising when the minister had started so positively on other aspects of the financial sector, like one identification number for all transactions. The other negative is that, somehow, one feels that some of our old errors would continue. Refinancing rural cooperatives without realizing why they have failed more often than not is another case in point.

 Though the budget speech was longer than the one last time, the finance ministers colleagues were relatively quiet except when taxes were reduced on pet-food. This was a pleasant surprise, given that Quattrochi is still in Argentina and Punjab was lost to the Shiromani Akali Dal. One explanation for this could be that the budget was simply too strong on long-term measures for anyone to identify anything of immediate political interest. Let us hope that this trend persists in the future.

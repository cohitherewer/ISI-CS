 Trouble over water

 Towards Water Wisdom: Limits, Justice, Harmony (Sage, Rs 350) by Ramaswamy R. Iyer is an important book that locates the problem of water scarcity as one of mismanagement rather than scarcity. While discussing water- related conflicts in India the dispute over sharing the resources of the Cauvery, for instance Iyer argues that there is an urgent need to prioritize the right to water over contractual and economic rights. It is significant that while discussing the role played by the Narmada Bachao Andolan, Iyer recognizes the fact that representative parliamentary democracy cannot always be presumed to be fully representative of or responsive to the people. He also exposes the limitations of Indias water laws and presses for a change in thinking at the level of policy-making. Only this, Iyer asserts, can ensure an equitable distribution of water.

 Glamour (Headline, 6.00) by Louise Bagshawe has all the ingredients that go into the making of a chick-lit novel. Written by a best-selling woman author, Glamour is the story of three friends all women who become fabulously rich after starting a global chain of stores. Of course, Bagshawe throws in the required quota of handsome men, glitz and triumph, perhaps in the hope of keeping women readers interested. But good times never last long, at least in chick-lit novels. So the friends Sally, Jane and Helen soon find their business on the brink and their friendship in tatters. Something in their lives has changed, and changed forever. Would they succeed in becoming friends again? Unfortunately for Bagshawe, not many would be interested in finding out the answer.

Bitter Ocean (Headline, 8.99) by David Fairbank White revisits the Battle of the Atlantic, one of the fiercest exchanges that took place between Allied and Axis troops during the Second World War. White makes use of first-hand accounts to depict the horrors of the conflict the deaths of countless men and the destruction of ships. He also weaves charismatic characters into the plot, some of them skilled fighters, who were engaged in combat with a dangerous enemy. The photographs in the book also offer glimpses of this terrible battle on water.

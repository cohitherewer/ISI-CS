 Dangerous trend

 Sir Lawlessness in Bihar continues unabated despite the grand promises made by the chief minister, Nitish Kumar (Mob batters 10 thieves to death, Sept 14). Lynching some petty thieves and gouging their eyes out are not the same thing as slapping a young child to discipline him. The government must step in to prevent people from dispensing their own forms of justice. In this case, the people sitting in judgment were criminals of a worse kind than the ones they punished to death.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir Of late, media reports of road accidents and petty offences, where people have taken the law into their hands and dispensed rough and ready justice, have been appearing a little too frequently. Often, such justice takes the form of beating up to the point of killing offenders and setting public property like buses on fire. Such events are mostly reported from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and, to some extent, Bengal, where public temper always seems to veer close to the boiling point. Social psychologists ought to study this phenomenon and suggest ways of avoiding such incidents. The government, which appears ignorant of this trend, should wake up and take action before more lives are lost and property destroyed at the hands of enraged mobs. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir Mob fury is not an unfamiliar thing in India. But recently, it has reached its ugliest, most murderous form. A few weeks back, in Bhagalpur a man called Aurangzeb was tied to a police motorcycle and dragged shirtless on the streets for stealing a gold chain while people looked on encouragingly (Blinding then, bike now, Aug 29). Days later, a group of around 300 people beat 10 men to death on suspicion of theft. Democracy in India is silently but surely crossing the thin line that divides civic action from criminality. It is shocking how little it takes to spark such outrage. Be it rage over a petty crime, desecration of a statue, eve-teasing, or a controversial depiction of gods by artists ordinary men and women throw all caution to the wind and turn into a faceless force on the loose. The primary idea of democracy is to give power to the people, but if the same power is used to bypass the course of law and order, then the institution of democracy will be shattered. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md Ziyaullah Khan, Kondhwa Khurd, Pune

 Sir The lynching of 10 thieves in Rajapakar in Vaishali has been condemned by the media. But the same newspapers used to be full of stories of abduction, corruption and general lawlessness in Bihar which criticized the intertia of the public. Now that the people have finally lost faith in the police and punished the guilty, they are being portrayed as the real criminals. What are the Biharis to do then?

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir The recent case of street violence that Bengal witnessed in Durgapur, where a furious mob set 16 trucks ablaze after the death of a biker, points to a dangerous trend (Biker bleeds,trucks burn, Sept 16). This incident and the lynching in Bihar show how monstrous self-styled justice can be. Instead of thinking only about short-term gains, vote banks and petty squabbles, our political leaders should address this alarming trend immediately. 

 Yours faithfully,

Susmita Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Content control

 Sir A costumed half-beast-half-human warrior with Bambi eyes splatters an enormous amount of blood on your television set and roars as he watches his enemies gasp and writhe in pain. Its natural to die is the message. Children and adolescents love him. Inu Yasha, a dashing character who battles high-octane acts of brutality, is one of the most popular heroes on Animax, a cartoon channel that shows anime or Japanese-style animation round-the-clock. Cartoons for us still mean entertainment for children the droves of adults rushing to watch Happy Feet or the latest Shrek film notwithstanding. What many parents may not know is that a lot of anime content available on cartoon channels is suitable only for adults. Yet, it is being avidly watched by children. The problem is that if Animax has repositioned itself, it has not done enough to disengage its child-viewers. Its new logo a skull with crossbones, which proclaims Be Different is hardly designed to scare off kids. The debate on what is appropriate viewing for children is an old one and will always be subjective. The real concern that arises out of the shows on the cartoon channels is about the diminishing control one has over childrens environment today, dominated as it is by technology and consumerism. In such a world, ideas of wholesomeness and innocence are bound to fall by the wayside. 

 Yours faithfully,

Farzana Z. Khan, Pune

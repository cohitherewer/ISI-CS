 WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE

 Sudeep Paul

 Botoler jinis(h), mukhe diley finis(h). If that sounds like an eager hawkers amusing improvisation, it is. But imagine this punchline being repeated, non-stop, for a full minute, with the mouth uttering it gradually closing in on you, even as your fellow commuters push you off your feet. All the while, you strain your ears to hear, over the public address system, the reason why your train has been stuck at this station for the last half-an-hour. You are also bent, at an unnatural angle, over bony shoulders, within sniffing distance of sweaty armpits. Add to the picture a couple more bellowing hawkers, heading towards you from the opposite end of the compartment, one of whom picks a territorial fight with his colleague. Now, imagine suffering this ordeal several times a week, sometimes twice on the same day. 

 Taking a local train daily for most of your life grants you a sociological perspective which is at odds with the fashionable, politically correct, academic worldview. I have learnt, therefore, to hesitate when I ought to condemn a passengers impulse of throwing out a hawker, or hawkers, from the train. That is because I too have often felt the same impulse during many a rush hour. In practice, however, you teach yourself to grit your teeth and bear it. What such impulses invariably trigger is a raging debate in the head about the unholy alliance of labour unionism and political opportunism that has created and perpetuated such civic monstrosities. A commuter pays not only for the service but also for the quality of that service. By purchasing a ticket, the passenger places an inviolable trust in the railways to ensure that trains serve their fundamental purpose of taking people to their destinations without causing inconvenience. 

 The usually high-pitched shriek of a hawker causes an initial shock that turns, over the succeeding minutes, into profound irritation for the disinterested commuter. This irritation is not merely psychological but perhaps also physiological. It increases as the voice draws near. The moment the volume begins to subside, it is replaced by another, as another hawker takes his place. Those who believe in the romanticized idea of hawkers providing relief to passengers from the monotony of a boring journey have never commuted by local trains on a daily basis. Many among the commuters are old or sick or both; many are students. And not one of them deserves to be pestered by hawkers. On the seamier side, fake vendors drug and rob passengers every now and then in near-empty afternoon trains and on deserted platforms. The more impudent among them may molest school and college girls. Hawkers may be welcome on long-distance travel, but their presence on suburban trains is not half as necessary. It is often the bane of passengers. 

 Of course, few of us can boast of gruesome encounters with hawkers. But there is always a possibility of experiencing one. Take the following for example. One day, while I was engrossed in Bohumil Hrabals Too Loud a Solitude, my solitude was shattered by a hawkers Guli, guli, guli, guli To everyone caught in a state of panic, the fellow held up a bottle of his digestive hojmi guli. When I refused the free sample, something I always did, the slighted hawker snatched the book from my hands, studied its cover and dropped it on my lap with the admonition, Train-e jachhen, mukh chalachhen na, edike boi porchhen kano? Bohu miler boi porchhen, kintu aar paanchjoner sathe aapnar kono mil nei kano? (Why is it that you are travelling by train but reading instead of munching on something? This is a book on many harmonies, but why arent you in harmony with the others?). It had taken me some time to figure out who, between the two of us, was the more exasperated. There used to be a hawker on my route who would sell imitation jewellery at a discount, but would give his prospective customers only 30 seconds to approach him, failing which they would lose the discount. Often, he would haughtily refuse to sell and would saunter off. If there is any hawker that I do miss from my days of local- train travel, it is, ironically, this chap who once got slapped by an irritated office-goer for screeching right next to the gentlemans ear as he was being informed over his mobile phone that his father had just died.

 Letters to Editor

 Within limits

 Sir The striking down of the immunity of the Ninth Schedule, introduced in 1951 to avoid judicial objections to land reform, is a much awaited judgment (Court rips protective cloak around laws, Jan 12). Till 1973, the laws put under the schedule were mostly related to agrarian reforms. But after 1973, especially during the Emergency, this schedule was blatantly misused by political parties to secure partisan gains. The subjects included in the schedule rose to over 280. Now various controversial laws, like the 69 per cent reservation passed by Tamil Nadu, will face judicial review. The apex court verdict should not be taken as undue interference into the workings of the legislature. While the legislature enacts law, it is the judiciarys duty to see whether they are in accordance with constitutional norms. Hopefully, the ruling will stop politicians from using parliament as a platform to pass laws for personal benefit.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind Kumar Singh, Dhanbad

 Sir The Supreme Courts decision to examine the validity of laws on subjects placed in the Ninth schedule might seal the fate of many political stalwarts. Legislative diktats, which violate the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, have become the order of the day. The courts decision is welcome since it would compel politicians to be more responsible while framing laws. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir In order to keep their votebanks intact, politicians have continued to take advantage of the Ninth Schedule by including certain controversial legislations in it. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court brings within the scope of review certain laws that were enjoying the protection of the Ninth Schedule for so long. The number of subjects and laws included in this schedule has increased continuously, thereby ignoring the original intent of its inclusion. The attempt to bring the enhanced reservation for other backward classes in the purview of the schedule is a classic example. The ruling will help check the misuse of power by members of parliament. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir Three decades since the Emergency, politicians have enacted populist laws and put them in the Ninth Schedule so as to avoid any judicial review. Some of the laws were passed with an eye to the vote-bank and some others for the sake of even narrower political interests. But no law passed for the greater common good should be beyond judicial scrutiny. The Constitution is supreme and no law, even if passed unanimously by the legislature, can violate its basic principles. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir The number of amendments to the constitution of the United States of America since 1787 has been 27, while there have been 93 amendments to the Indian Constitution in the past 59 years. It was necessary for the apex court to rescue the Ninth Schedule from politicians. The judgment will prevent arbitrary decisions taken by MPs from becoming laws that cannot be contested by the people in the court. With this ruling, the judiciary has once again upheld Indias democratic values and prevented the political establishment from subverting it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Perverted acts

 Sir In a world where men do not even spare their own daughters to satisfy sexual needs, there should be serious measures taken for the protection of women who are vulnerable to abuse (Rapist father, loved still, Jan 3). Though we have several laws in place, there are a number of loopholes that allow criminals to get away. If adults find it difficult to cope with physical abuse, one can imagine what trauma it bears for a child who is raped by her own father. Such cases should be severely dealt with, especially because of the tender age of the victim. 

 Yours faithfully,

Hina Murtaza, Calcutta

 Sir The report, Minors raped in Guwahati (Jan 4), in the Guwahati edition of The Telegraph was shocking. More news of sexual crimes against children is surfacing since the news of the Noida killings. If a 9-year-old child could be raped within the Nehru Stadium in Guwahati only weeks before the city hosts the National Games, one can imagine how alert the administration is to such crimes in more ordinary times. Children are most vulnerable to abuse by their close family members. There should be a law in place to ensure their protection within the confines of the family. They should also be made aware of their rights and how they can be abused.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir The report, Rapist let off with a fine (Jan 11), states that a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Kalam Sheikh, and his panchayat colleague from the Congress, Amjad Sheikh, presided over a shalishi meeting in a Murshidabad village and let a rapist go after asking him to pay a paltry sum. If such incidents continue unchecked , it will not be long before Murshidabad turns into another destination for sex-tourism with price tags. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

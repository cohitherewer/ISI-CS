The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 EASY GAME

 Comparisons with the past are often odious and sometimes unfair. The point is worth noting when setting Roger Federers record of five consecutive Wimbledon wins against the same record made by Bjrn Borg. The differences are far too many to make any kind of reasonable comparison. First is the difference in rackets: Mr Borg played with a wooden one and all players today use graphite ones, whose heads are bigger than those of the rackets that were used by past players. These have increased hitting power and control. Second, the weight of the balls that are now being used has been increased, which means that they travel slower than the lighter ones that were previously in use. Most important, in the specific case of Wimbledon this year, the grass surface has been doctored to make it slower. The cumulative effect of all this has been a dramatic shift in the nature of the game. When Mr Borg played in Wimbledon, he came to the tournament straight after the French Open, where he excelled. The surface in Roland Garros is clay and is known to be slow. Mr Borg moved from this surface to the fast grass courts of Wimbledon with supreme ease and mastery. Champions today also come to Wimbledon after the French Open but the courts in Wimbledon have been made noticeably slower over the years. In fact, in terms of speed, there is little distinction between the clay court at Roland Garros and the present-day grass ones in Wimbledon. This has made adjustments for Wimbledon that much more easy for players. This was emphatically not the case in Mr Borgs time. The point being made is confirmed by the fact that Rafael Nadal, essentially a clay-court player, could stretch Mr Federer to five sets on a grass surface. It can be said without too much exaggeration that if Mr Nadal and Mr Federer were to meet on a genuinely fast surface say the courts of South Club in Calcutta the match would not extend beyond the protocol three sets.

 There is perhaps a bigger point tucked away within the argument being made here. In many competitive sports in the world, rules and conditions of play are being changed to make the game easier and more popular. Similar tendencies are noticeable in the changes introduced in cricket. Covering of pitches, restrictions in field placing and so on, all have made the game easier for batsmen, who are the main attraction of the game. There is a shift away from purity to popularity, which is perhaps a sign of the times.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 CAREER AND MARRIAGE

 There are many reasons for getting married. Love is the commonest one cited in modern times. In feudal times, the perpetuation of the male family line was the principal reason for taking a wife. Very recently, in an outspoken interview, Ms Indra Nooyi, the head of PepsiCo, told Mr Nandan Nilekani, that more than love or any other reason, what was important in a marriage was the support a partner provided in a career. Ms Nooyi is one of the most successful professionals in a field that is dominated by men. Her views are, of course, coloured by her own experiences but her opinion offers a new perspective on the role a partner can play in the pursuit of a career. In the days of the British Raj, when the managing agencies controlled business and commercial interests in Calcutta, it was customary for young covenanted officers to present their prospective spouses to the burra sahib of the company. Only after the burra sahib had given his approval could the marriage take place. This might appear to be a grotesque interference in the private life of a professional, but the practice was not without logic. Those who ran the managing agencies wanted to check if the chosen bride-to-be had the requisite qualities to fit into the Westernized ambience and socializing that formed a very crucial part of a young professionals life in these companies. An unsuitable wife could lead to discordance in conjugal life, which could affect work. Ms Nooyi is perhaps suggesting the same thing from a different angle. 

 She knows that for a woman it is impossible to go up the corporate ladder if support from the husband and the family is not forthcoming. The life of a woman, even in the West, is often determined by some unwritten social expectations. It is taken for granted that a woman will look after the home, the kitchen and the children. These activities are time- and attention-consuming and often difficult to combine with other full-time activities like running a company, which is what Ms Nooyi does with outstanding success. The path of her career has been somewhat smoothened because her husband took over and shared some of the responsibilities which are conventionally seen as belonging to a woman. Ms Nooyi has thus drawn a very legitimate lesson from her own experiences. She is telling all those who see her as an exemplar, to be careful in their choice of the partner. She is telling them not to be blinded by love and to consider what support the partner can provide in terms of furthering ones career. In a world where more and more women are pursuing careers and are eager to further their careers, Ms Nooyis advice is sound.

 What is worth underlining is that Ms Nooyis advice follows from a definite premise. She believes that running a company being a CEO is a calling. It cannot be treated as just another job. The notion of a calling carries with it moral overtones. A calling makes all other aspects of ones life secondary to it. Thus one even marries to further ones calling. The call of love is not enough for wedlock.

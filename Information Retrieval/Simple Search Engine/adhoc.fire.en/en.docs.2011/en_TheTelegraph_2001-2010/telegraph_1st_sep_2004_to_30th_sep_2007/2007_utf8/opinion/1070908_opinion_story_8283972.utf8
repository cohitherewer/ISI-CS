 CELEBRATING IN STYLE

 Sharmila Basu Thakur

 Dance

 A year-long celebration commemorating ten years of Nandanik Manipuri Dance Academy concluded in a most befitting manner with a traditional Manipuri performance at Gyan Manch on August 10. Poushali Chatterjee (picture), an experienced Manipuri dancer and a mentor of the academy, was groomed by Guru Bipin Singh. Poushali believes in a straight and simple way of presentation, which gives her productions an authentic flavour. Much is happening today in the name of experimental choreography which is ruining the purity of classical dance. 

 The evening commenced with Showcase, comprising different traditional numbers. It began with Pontha Jagoi, an item inspired by nitya ras. It depicted a competition between Krishna and Radha in intricate rhythm patterns. Poushali, as Radha in traditional Manipuri costume, and Debanjana Roy, as Krishna, danced to the rhythmic jugglery of seven beats. Both the tandava and lasya aspects were skilfully rendered. However, the stage looked too barren. Minimal stage props or suggestions could have brought out the drama of the presentation. 

 The next dance, Snapshot, demonstrated different steps and aspects like cholom, pung and thang-ta of the Manipuri style. Synchronized movements in tastefully-done black and red costume, demonstrated the true essence of this style. The idea of using sticks during the dance was attractive but it requires more practice to make the dance look more spontaneous. 

 Krishna-Balaram Nartan, an all-time favourite composition with the song, Nrityati Balaram, by June, Moumita, Titash, Olivia, Nayanika, Deesha and Arhana was enjoyable. The most interesting number of the evening was Prabandha Nartana, a composition that showed various elements of music, like swara (musical notes), pata (syllables of the drum), tenaka (ta, ri, ta, tana), tala (time measure) and pada (poetry) through various dance sequences. Rikhia, Moushumi, Sanchita and others proved their mettle in this number. 

 Gopi Gostha, a dance-drama composed by Guru Bipin Singh, was staged in the second half. Based on folk tunes of Bengal, the Radha-Krishna-Balaram-Kangsa episode was elaborately narrated. Shamobonti Chatterjee, Priyanka Talukdar were good as cowherd boys while Sanchita, Malabi, Madhubanti gave a graceful presentation as Radhas friends. Manipuri songs have a peculiar combination of devotion and martial spirit which bloomed in the rendition of Atashi Chatterjee. The Pung was played by Sushanta Das and the flute by Jayanta Chatterjee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IN THE NAME 

 OF THE GAME 

 - The BCCI is all about the control of cricket, not its promotion 

 Ashok Guha

 There is no more telling reflection 

 of the Indian passion for bureaucracy and control than in 

 the name of the organization that runs our favourite game. 

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India is absolutely 

 unique in being the only sports body in the world that proclaims 

 openly and proudly that its purpose is not the promotion 

 of the game but its control. And so inured are we as a people 

 to the imperial ways of authorities in every field that 

 this does not strike us as bizarre, or even as worthy of 

 comment.

 Indeed, every turn of cricketing 

 events intensifies the clamour for stricter control of the 

 game and its players by the board. The disastrous performance 

 of our cricketers in the World Cup amplified this clamour 

 to a hysterical crescendo. The Union minister for agriculture 

 and his bureaucratic retinue, so it was presumed, knew more 

 about the game and what should be done to improve it than 

 those who had played it all their lives and whose livelihoods 

 depended on their performance in it.

 A key element in the mental make-up 

 of the control freak is his distrust of the market and its 

 uncertainties. And indeed, the reflex reaction of the BCCI 

 (and many other Indians) to the World Cup debacle was to 

 blame it on the market: the players, especially the seniors, 

 were making millions by advertising, they spent too much 

 time in the studios when they should have been practising 

 their skills, their contracts encouraged them to hang on 

 at the crease rather than to take the risks involved in 

 scoring rapidly, the firms concerned pressured (that is, 

 bribed or blackmailed) selectors into choosing the players 

 they patronized regardless of performance, and so on. Some 

 such allegations were in fact publicly made by the Union 

 minister and his minions, attributing them of course to 

 unnamed junior players, so that they could not be held personally 

 responsible for them. The solution: severe restrictions 

 on the freedom of players regarding acceptance of advertising 

 contracts. Presumably, players, once relieved of the necessity 

 of securing more sponsorships or retaining those that they 

 had by improving their standing with the viewing public, 

 would somehow perform better.

 The BCCIs solution smacks of 

 magic. The market is the strongest incentive to performance 

 that there is. A player who disgraces himself on the field 

 is the last person an advertiser would want as a sponsor 

 for his product. And since firms stand to gain only from 

 sponsorship by highly successful players, any pressure 

 or influence that firms may exert on the selectors could 

 only be in favour of performance. How the elimination of 

 this imperative against failure could possibly improve performance 

 without supernatural intervention is something that no mere 

 mortal can fathom.

 If the BCCI formula is not to 

 be regarded as a magical incantation, it smacks mainly of 

 envy and greed. The Tendulkars, the Dravids, the Dhonis 

 earn crores merely by appearing in ads, many times more 

 than their controllers, the BCCI officialdom. This is 

 a perversion of the moral order, one that must be rectified. 

 And what better opportunity for rectification than when 

 the high-flying cricketers have been brought catastrophically 

 to earth? Here is the board in its self-proclaimed role 

 as a controller, although certainly not a propagator or 

 promoter, of the game.

 Indeed, if a controller is not 

 personally affected by the fortunes of what he controls, 

 there is no guarantee that he will exercise his power for 

 any objective other than his personal interests and passions. 

 Consider the following true story. In October 2004, the 

 Australians, on their revenge tour of India, arrived in 

 Nagpur leading 1-0 for the crucial third test, expecting 

 a dry turning pitch on which Kumble and Harbhajan would 

 eviscerate them. They found to their amazed delight a greentop 

 on which their pace bowlers massacred the Indian batsmen. 

 The wicket had apparently been prepared by the groundsman 

 on the orders of the secretary of the Vidarbha Cricket Association 

 in defiance of the pleas of the Indian captain, Sourav Ganguly, 

 for a pitch that suited his team rather than the visitors. 

 The expected result was achieved. India were routed, Australia 

 secured an unassailable 2-0 lead and the revenge they sought 

 for their previous defeat. 

 A year later, Nagpur and the Vidarbha 

 Cricket Association were again hosts for an international 

 match, the first ODI against Sri Lanka. On precisely the 

 same ground in precisely the same season, the groundsman 

 on the orders of the VCA secretary produced a pitch on which 

 the Indian spinners captured seven wickets for next to nothing 

 and Sri Lanka collapsed to a crushing defeat from which 

 they never recovered. 

 Undoubtedly, the VCA secretary, 

 now a very big wig of the BCCI, effectively controlled the 

 game on both occasions. The loss to Australia smashed the 

 larger-than-life images of the Indian team, its captain 

 Ganguly and his patron-in-chief Jagmohan Dalmiya with whom 

 the VCA secretary was then locked in a bitter power-struggle. 

 A year later, Ganguly had been ejected, Dalmiya was on his 

 way to oblivion, a new coach and a new captain had been 

 installed, whose success would proclaim to the world that 

 Indian cricket was better off without its former captain 

 and his mentor. Both the outcomes on the field exactly matched 

 the personal interests of the VCA secretary. No doubt, the 

 match was entirely coincidental.

 Controllers and bureaucrats understand 

 and sympathize with each other; of course when there is 

 no conflict of interest. No surprise therefore that the 

 one person with whom the BCCI could find no fault after 

 the World Cup disaster was the coach. Greg Chappell was 

 appointed by the BCCI, despite a resounding failure in his 

 only previous coaching stint, on the basis of a presentation, 

 a concept much loved by bureaucrats if bizarre-seeming to 

 sportsmen. He distinguished himself throughout his tenure 

 by seeking an imperial role for himself, sidelining all 

 rival centres of influence (such as seniors other than the 

 most pliable and selectors who disagreed with him), manipulating 

 the media by calculated leaks and off-the-record critiques 

 of players whose confidence he wished to undermine and other 

 such stratagems well-known to controllers and bureaucrats. 

 In any other country, a defeat 

 like the World Cup debacle, climaxing a long string of failures, 

 would precipitate instant dismissal of the coach. Not so 

 in India. The BCCI claimed that the coach had no role in 

 team performance (presumably, his princely salary, palatial 

 house and other perquisites were merely courtesies by the 

 board) and invited him to make yet another presentation 

 on what ails Indian cricket. This presentation was a bureaucratic 

 masterpiece: it blamed everybody except the coach senior 

 players whom he could not totally control, selectors who 

 defied him, even the board which had not restructured itself 

 according to his vision, presumably on the tacit pretext 

 that he was just the coach and not the CEO. The board loved 

 it and offered him a new position as consultant to its cricket 

 academy. Luckily for our young cricketers, he declined.

 Yet even today, Chappells demand, 

 echoed by various BCCI dignitaries, for an iron hand visibly 

 controlling the game and its players strikes a chord in 

 many a bureaucratic Indian heart. Fortunately, the invisible 

 hand of the market is already at work, deflating any would-be 

 dictatorial designs. Endorsements and advertising revenues 

 are drying up; their revival requires some outstanding displays, 

 for which we need the best possible cricketers and coach, 

 chosen on the basis of performance rather than the whims 

 of some tinpot Napoleon.

 DIARY

 Bark and bite

 The budget has come and gone but Jairam Ramesh continues to be hounded by the dog food controversy. Ramesh, in jest, had reportedly told Left leaders to eat dog food (made cheaper by the budget), after they complained about rising prices. The remarks failed to raise a laugh, and even got the PM frowning, forcing Ramesh on the backfoot. First, he blamed the verbal slip on an upset tummy. When that didnt work, he asked the TV channels to take the remarks off the air. That didnt happen either, making Rameshs supporters point fingers at a powerful minister for ensuring that the comments stayed on air. There was more trouble in store for poor Ramesh. A section of ministers, hoping to turn the heat on Sharad Pawar, who they thought was the real culprit for the price rise, turned their guns on Ramesh for creating a controversy that helped Pawar deflect the brickbats. But Ramesh should not worry. Every dog has its day. 

 As the news of the poll debacle trickled in, the faces of Congress workers got longer at the headquarters in the capital. However, in Uttarakhand, ND Tiwari, the outgoing chief minister, could not stop beaming. An exit from the assembly meant he could now concentrate on gaining an entry into the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Tiwari-loyalists were a cheerful lot as well, and they spent their time wishing their leader luck in his new endeavour. They blamed the partys poor showing on the high commands failure to project the veteran leader as the next chief minister. Meanwhile, in Punjab, Amarinder Singh, the dethroned king, was busy grinding his own axe. Singh attributed his defeat at the hands of the SAD-BJP combine on the Centres inept handling of economic issues. However, all this grumbling has not gone down well with those who run the show in Delhi. The HQ, one hears, is against giving Singh a consolation prize, unlike another ousted chief minister, Digvijay Singh, who went on to become the gen-sec of the AICC. This is certainly not good news for the beaming Tiwari. He may soon find that the road to Rashtrapati Bhawan is littered with thorns.

 Most Indians may be hooked on trendy mobile phones and lap tops. But these gizmos are pass among politicians in Madhya Pradesh. For these netas, currency counting machines are now a prized acquisition. The counting machines gained currency after several ministers and political functionaries realized that they were being shortchanged by wily fund managers. On one occasion, the wife of an important politician saw through a moneybags bluff with the help of the machine, which revealed that a sum of Rs 5 lakh set aside for charity was, in reality, less than Rs 4 lakh. And it is not as if only politicians have struck gold. Last heard, doctors, nursing home owners and even some cash-rich religious organizations are now busy scouting for a currency counting machine to save themselves from the menace of fake currency.

 Wheels of the government grind ever so slowly, even in these times of breakneck speed and instant communication. Seven years ago, parliament had passed a law to set up a body known as the Competition Commission. This was supposed to replace the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, a relic from the days of the licence raj. The commission came into being in mid-2003, and a member-secretary and some other personnel were appointed. But the commission hasnt started functing till date. The staff have no reason to complain though. They have virtually been on a paid holiday, although they claim to be busy in spreading the message of fair competition. The ministries of company affairs and law, perhaps inspired by the lethargy of successive governments, have shown no urgency to end the wasteful exercise.

 In Maharashtra, RR Patil, the deputy CM, has set a rather dubious record. He managed to coerce as many as 119 nominees, many of them from the Shiv Sena and the BJP, to withdraw their nominations to zilla and panchayat samiti elections. The State EC had set a 3 pm deadline for the withdrawl of nominations on March 2. Till 2.59, only 12 candidates had withdrawn their forms. But by the time the clock struck 3 an incredible number of 119 applicants withdrew, allegedly after receiving threats from Patil rsquo;s supporters. But Patil did not quite have the last laugh. The EC ordered a repoll and an FIR has been filed against the minister. So much for acting in record time. 

 Move over Ash and Shilpa. It is now time to make place for Mallika Sherawat for the top spot. Sherawat has reportedly landed herself in a Hollywood film called Unveiled, to be directed by Bill Bannerman,Clint Eastwoods one-time associate director. In the process, she has also nudged out heavyweights such as Hillary Swank and Penelope Cruz, who were in the race for bagging a role in the project. The film tells the story of a Muslim woman with two husbands and one lover, and is supposedly the first flick to feature a Muslim woman as the protagonist. Sherawat is to play the role of the burqa-clad woman who is attractive and dangerous at the same time. Bannerman is supposed to have been on the lookout for a woman from south Asia or the Middle East who had the right accent, body language and knowledge of relevant customs. With a little bit of help, Mallika may manage to do all this, but what seems to have escaped Bannerman is that a fully-covered Sherawat may not get the cash registers jingling.

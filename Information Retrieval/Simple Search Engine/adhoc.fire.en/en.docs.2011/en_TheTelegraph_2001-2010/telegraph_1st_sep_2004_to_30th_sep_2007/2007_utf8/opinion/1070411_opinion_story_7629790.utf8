 COUNTERPOINT

 In dealing with the minority communities, governments solutions are often worse than the problems. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees plea for a campus of the Aligarh Muslim University in Murshidabad is another case in point. The social, economic and educational backwardness of the Muslim community in Bengal had been known long before the Sachar committees report was published. Although the majority of the Muslims vote for the Left, they have not benefited much from the governments policies. There is no debate, therefore, on the need for more official programmes that will benefit the community. But the chief ministers idea of an AMU campus in Muslim-majority Murshidabad district is flawed on two counts. It is difficult to see how a Muslim university can help the community improve its conditions. If anything, such a university, and the sentiments that go with it, will only create communal ghettos. Instead of higher education helping Muslims, such sentiments may actually pull them further apart from other communities. The other problem with Mr Bhattacharjees suggestion is more fundamental to the concept of higher education. Universities are meant to be centres of excellence. Setting up a university in order to help a community is to take a warped view of higher education and the States role in promoting it. 

 It is not difficult to understand, though, why Mr Bhattacharjee has come up with the idea. The Sachar committees findings paint a rather grim picture of the discriminations and deprivations that Muslims suffer throughout the country. But it has identified Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as the worst cases. It explodes the myth about the Left being more concerned with the welfare of Muslims. Also, the recent political turmoil over the acquisition of land for industries has prompted some stirrings within the community, thanks mainly to Mr Siddiqullah Chowdhury. The chief minister, it would appear, urgently needs to take some affirmative action in order to redeem the governments image. His party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has announced a campaign plan in support of the recommendations of the Sachar committee. Bengal would do well to add to these. But any move that makes Muslims feel more like a minority community can be counterproductive.

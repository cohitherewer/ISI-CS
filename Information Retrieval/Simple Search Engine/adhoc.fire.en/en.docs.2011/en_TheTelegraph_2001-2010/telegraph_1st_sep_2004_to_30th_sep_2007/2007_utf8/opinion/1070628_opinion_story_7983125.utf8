The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NEXT, PLEASE

 For a short while yesterday, between Tony Blair saying goodbye and Gordon Brown saying hello at Buckingham Palace, Britain was without a prime minister, and the queen held sway. These were odd moments for a democracy. And, indeed, there have been a few odd things about this succession. There was a distinctly monarchical feel to it: one personality took over from another, without anything like an election in sight. For more than a decade now, Mr Brown, the longest-serving chancellor in modern British history, has been the heir apparent, a prime minister in the wings. He has sulked and fumbled, some would say, without ever quite coming forward to oust his rival, even when the time had seemed ripe last September for doing so. Calling for a general election, an eminent Liberal Democrat has described this transition as the longest coronation in history. But Mr Brown has taken over with another triumphal twist in the partys tale: the defection to Labour of Quentin Davies, the Tory MP, successfully engineered by Mr Brown himself. Mr Davies sees himself as defecting from the shifting sands of the Tory leaderships cynicism, superficiality, unreality, and an apparent lack of convictions to the bedrock of Mr Browns party with the soul put back into it by the new prime minister. In his acceptance speech for the party leadership, Mr Brown had called himself a conviction politician.

 Whatever the character of Mr Browns new cabinet, it is significant that Labours new deputy leader, Harriet Harman, had opposed the Iraq war when the party had split over Mr Blairs decision to stand by the United States of America. Mr Blairs farewell, yesterday, was also darkened by protests, in front of No. 10, by parents of soldiers who have died in Iraq. Calling themselves Military Families Against the War, they are determined that Mr Blair will not be allowed to forget the suffering he has caused.

 Yet it is almost certain that Mr Blairs crucial role in the war with its baffling mix of credulousness and conviction is now set to be given a wider scope. George W. Bush wants him to be the Middle East envoy after he steps down as prime minister, and even perhaps as MP. If Mr Bush manages to get the European Union, United Nations and Russia to agree about this, then Mr Blair will be working with the Palestinian president on building the infrastructure for a future state or couple of states. Nothing embodies the ironic turns of history better than this new figure of Mr Blair as envoy and peacemaker. With Iraq and Afghanistan behind him (and perhaps Kosovo as well), Hamas has already decided not to accept him in this bizarre new role. Yet, he might still manage to show the world, almost miraculously, that his end is some sort of a beginning too.

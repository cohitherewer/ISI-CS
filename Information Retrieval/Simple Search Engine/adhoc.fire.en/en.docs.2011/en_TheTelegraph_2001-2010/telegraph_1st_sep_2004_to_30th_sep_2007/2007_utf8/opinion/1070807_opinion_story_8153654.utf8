 Letters to Editor

 Second stint

Delayed justice

 Sir The verdict on Sanjay Dutt shows that India has an impartial judicial system (Blind justice, Aug 1). But justice must take into account the criminal record of the accused, the intent of his crime, and the circumstances in which he had committed it. The sentence on Dutt could have been less harsh. After all, he has been living under the shadow of his crime for 14 years during which time he had reformed himself and stayed away from the underworld.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Das, Singapore

 Sir Sanjay Dutt has been found guilty under the law of the land, and handed a sentence. Admirers of the actor are entitled to feel sorry for him, but there is no cause for the sensation that the media are creating around him.

 Yours faithfully,

N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir Arguments in favour of reducing the sentence on Sanjay Dutt because he has suffered for 14 years are irrational. The judgment in a complicated case such as the Mumbai blasts is expected to take a long time. Moreover, why should Dutt be freed on humanitarian grounds when every other accused has been punished? Judge Pramod Kode should be congratulated for his even-handed and balanced verdict on the sensitive case.

 Yours faithfully, 

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir Perhaps Sanjay Dutt does not deserve to spend time in jail after atoning his crime for 14 years, but the wages of a crime committed with the full knowledge of its consequences cannot be waived. Not only would Dutts acquittal be unfair to the victims of the bombings, but it would also discriminate between Dutt and the others accused in the case. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.S. Jayatheertha, Bangalore

 Sir The information and broadcasting minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, has spoken for many by criticizing the 6-year sentence given to Sanjay Dutt. From some of the remarks of the judge too it seems that he wants the apex court to grant reprieve to Dutt. The actor was probably punished so that no one could criticize the court for being prejudiced in favour of Dutt. The aim of punishment is to reform the convict. Dutt should have been given relief on this very count, for his exemplary behaviour during the earlier stint in jail, and after he was released, when he lived as an ideal citizen. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Living in suspense for 14 years is far more tortuous than six years in jail. Having been allowed to move freely for years, Sanjay Dutt had the liberty to tamper with evidence which he did not. Isnt such behaviour itself reason enough for Dutts acquittal? In fact, he should not only be pardoned but also be compensated for the delay in dispensing justice. Dutt comes from a decent family, has no criminal record, and has pleaded for forgiveness ever since he was produced in court. P.V. Narasimha Rao, the former prime minister, once got a prison sentence. He was not sent to a common jail but kept under house arrest. Dutt deserves no less respect. 

 Yours faithfully,

Danendra Jain, Ranchi

 Sir Priya Ranjan Das Munshis comment that S anjay Dutt would get redress from the Supreme Court comes close to contempt of court. Given his party affiliations, he should have known that people would inevitably read political meanings into his statement. As it is, Das Munshis moral policing has been getting on our nerves for a while; now he has started appearing sillier than ever.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir I feel that Sanjay Dutt is paying the price of his celebrity status, rather than of the crime he had committed 14 years ago. Pramod Kode has gone out of his way to prove that the law of the land is equal for everyone. Had Dutt not been convicted, the secularists would have alleged that the minority community has been victimized. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir Many in India may feel sorry for Sanjay Dutt. But many more would be happy that justice has been executed impartially. The judge need not be apologetic about his verdict. His kinds words to Dutt, and his saying that he was just doing his duty (as if he regretted it), were not required.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir In 1993, Sanjay Dutt was 33, not a child with no idea of the enormity of the incidents happening around him. He did possess illegal arms in full knowledge of the consequences, and now he must face the music. There is no need to be sentimental about this, as if Sunju Baba is a little schoolboy who has been punished more severely than he deserves. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 Sir Did The Telegraph have to waste three full pages on Sanjay Dutt? Dutt may have won laurels for his role in the Munnabhai films, but it is just as true that he possessed illegal arms. While reporting cases of terrorism, which killed hundreds of people, the media should think of the victims first, even when a first-rate actor is among the accused.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S.Mehta, Calcutta

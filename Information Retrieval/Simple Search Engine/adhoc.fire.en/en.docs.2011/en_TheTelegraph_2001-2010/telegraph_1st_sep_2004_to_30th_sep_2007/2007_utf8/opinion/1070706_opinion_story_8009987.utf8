 Letters to Editor

 Foreign presence 

 Sir The United Progressive Alliance government has sent out a rather alarming message by allowing the warship, USS Nimitz, to dock near the Chennai harbour (If Nasty is on Nimitz, it means America wants to be nice, July 2). The government is so obsessed with the United States of America that it seems to have spent little thought on the dangers that could be posed by the presences of a nuclear vessel on Indian waters. The UPA is simply taking the statements made by US officials for granted, and has allowed itself to believe that the Americans mean no harm at all. The government is desperately seeking to get the 123 Agreement through, so much so that it is not worried about putting the security of the entire country at risk. Although the Left parties have created a stir over this issue, whatever they have said so far seems to have been out of political correctness. After all, they would hardly want to alienate themselves from their allies at the Centre. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Marxists have started sounding ridiculous as they cry themselves hoarse over their useless ideologies. Even their anti-Americanism has become a routine gesture. Recently, they have managed to make themselves look silly by raising a storm over the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Nimitz, harboured two nautical miles off the Chennai port. Since the government of India has sanctioned the halt at Chennai, the uproar over this issue is quite redundant. If these custodians of the Left had their minds in the right place, they would perhaps spare a few thoughts on more fundamental questions. For instance, is the docking of an American warship more detrimental to our national interests than Chinas claim on Arunachal Pradesh? Why did these same people not raise their voices when China threatened Indias sovereignty? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The manner in which the Left has objected to the docking of a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier near an Indian port because of the supposed threat of radiation it poses to the country is appalling, to say the least. Is the US government silly enough to have ignored the possibility of such a threat to the thousands of officials who are working round-the-clock on the ship? Presumably, the USS Nimitz must have docked near Chennai after having sought the permission of the Indian authorities. 

 It is not credible either that the Indian government would grant permission to an American vessel to stopover on its territory without first ensuring that all possible safety measures have been adhered to. Given the precarious stage at which the Indo-US nuclear deal stands at the moment, a single false move from either side might prove to be costly. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The presence of an American nuclear-powered warship on Indian shores is an ominous sign . After all, it cannot be a welcome prospect to have the worlds most powerful country send such a destructive machine to ones homeland. Sending a warship is a bit too sinister to be simply dismissed as a friendly gesture from one country to the other. With the 123 Agreement yet to be signed between America and India, one cannot ignore the significance of this gesture on the part of America. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir The comments from the US ambassador and the commanding officer of the USS Nimitz regarding the outcry over the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier sound rather supercilious. They consider the uproar to be baseless since the warship is here on the invitation of the Indian government. However, they seemed to have forgotten that government policies do not always reflect public opinion. Moreover, it is premature to claim that nuclear-powered vessels are perfectly safe. After all, the Three Mile Island incident in America and the Chernobyl disaster happened when they were least expected. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

 Parting shot

 Sir S.L. Rao has completely missed the ground reality in Triumph of Choice (July 2) in which he brazenly crowns the consumer to be the supreme factor in Indian economy. A visit to a multiplex in the city would prove him wrong. Here, an average movie ticket costs Rs 150 while a small box of popcorn can set you back by Rs 70. A similar experience in the UK is cheaper. Given that the ratio of average income of a Brit to an Indian is about 45:1, it can easily be noted where the value for money lies. Moreover, the widespread hankering for everything Western has led to undeserved elevation of non-exclusive brands to an elite status in India. This has more to do with consumer mentalities and their blind emulation of the West than with squeezed profit margins of the manufacturers and retailers. A typical anomaly is that in the West, local stores cannot offer economies of scale whereas supermarkets can. However, in India the corner shop offers a better deal on a wide array of products vis--vis the supermarket. Thus, to suggest that the Indian consumer has real choices in a marketplace that offers him value for money is nothing but fallacious.

 Yours faithfully,

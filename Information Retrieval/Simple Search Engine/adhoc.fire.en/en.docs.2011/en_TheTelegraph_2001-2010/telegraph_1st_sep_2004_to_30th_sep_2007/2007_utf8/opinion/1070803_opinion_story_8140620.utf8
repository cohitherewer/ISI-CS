 VIOLENCE STEEL

 The state seems to be withering away in Jharkhand. It is difficult, otherwise, to explain how the Maoist rebels continue to turn it into a killing field. The appalling thing about Wednesdays Maoist violence in the state is the governments failure to prevent it. The rebels had called a bandh in order to press their demand for the release of three of their arrested comrades. They had thus challenged the administration to try and foil their violent plans. This is not the first time that the government in Ranchi has cowered before the Maoist threat. Such failures on the part of the state are dangerously becoming routine. Worse still, a political vacuum has added to the administrative inefficiency. Successive governments in Ranchi have been unstable coalitions. They have been more concerned with their own survival than with administering the state. The persistent political instability has taken its toll on both the administrative structure and the morale of the bureaucracy. Recent reports have suggested that a large number of senior bureaucrats and police officers of Jharkhand have moved to other states or the Centre on deputation. This is a dangerous sign in a state where the level of the Maoist threat is as high as that in Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. 

 Ironically, Jharkhand is also on the priority list of big-time investors such as the Tata or Mittal group. The Maoist depredations notwithstanding, L.N. Mittal reaffirmed last week his groups plan to build a large steel plant in the state. There are other investors waiting to take advantage of Jharkhands rich reserves of mineral resources and set up new businesses there. The least the states political class and administration can do is restore a semblance of the rule of law. They owe it to not only the potential investors but also the common people of the state. Jharkhands grinding poverty feeds its Maoist rebellion. The only way to rescue the state from this vicious cycle is to regenerate its economy. Obviously, private capital alone can lead the way. Yet, the state will continue to have a major role in providing certain basic facilities to the poor. Also, the state will have to facilitate the acquisition of land for the new industries. It is safe to predict that this will unleash fresh social and political tensions. The Maoists will surely try to exploit them.The problem is that the rulers in Ranchi seem to be unconcerned about the challenges they face.

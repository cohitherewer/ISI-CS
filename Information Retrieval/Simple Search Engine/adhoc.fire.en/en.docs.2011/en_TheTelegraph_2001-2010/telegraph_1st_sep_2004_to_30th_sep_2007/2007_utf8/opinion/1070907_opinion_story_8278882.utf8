 PROMISES GET STIFLED

 Malvika Singh - 

 BONA FIDE 

 It was wonderful to see all the rounded-up comrades those who follow blindly, who have no clue about the details of the 123 deal and its many elements that will connect India with developed countries of the world and their myriad technologies being herded into sleek, imported, airconditioned Volvo buses, armed with bottles of mineral water made and marketed by Coke! The arrangements for the Left parties protest march were very American! How much more fake can the rhetoric get? This time it was there for all to see, as photographs appeared in the papers and visuals on our television screens. As a voyeur watching this possible endgame, a sadness crept in as one witnessed, with some regret, the intellectual degradation in the leadership of the Left Front.

 The simplistic arguments, the petulant retaliation, the hyper-ventilating that stems from youthful inexperience, the ugliness, all come together as a negative force, one that the Left is not willing to break free of. We can stand up for what we believe in and want for ourselves. We are an intellectually strong nation, able to construct ideas creatively and with relative ease. We are intrinsically philosophical. We have everything going for us, supported by the energy, innovation and entrepreneurship of people across all strata of our economy. We are a resilient people with enormous patience. Unfortunately, all the positive attributes of Indian society have been diluted over the last sixty years by those political players who promised to lead us into becoming an egalitarian society.

 The men and women mandated and paid to fulfil our dreams have managed to subject this country to indescribable indignities and bad governance. The latter has grown into a monster since 1975 and the period of the Emergency. If there has been one singular failure that has arrested development and change, it has been this criminal reality.

 Failing to deliver

 The inability of our political leadership, across the differing ideologies, to reassess and rethink methodologies and new delivery systems exposes the scary limitations of the minds of those in power. We are compelled to tolerate such incompetence because today, when diverse opportunities are at their disposal, the best and the brightest stay away from politics and from the civil services that were once coveted. 

 The diminished intellectual quality stares us in the face each living moment. It also shows how badly we have been let down. When compared with the flowing adrenaline and excitement to build and make good that is evident in the youth of Bharat, the betrayal is reinforced. Without a proper and clean administration and an accountability mechanism in place to deal with corrupt officers and politicians, India is bound to hurtle towards destructive, amoral anarchy. The ruling class is serving itself and needs to be overhauled. The corridors of power need to be cleared. Who will tackle our administrative machine to restore and renew it?

 Even the dictatorial regimes in some Indian states failed to deliver dignity of life and opportunities to their subjects. Those regimes destroyed the great traditions of India by suppressing them, describing them as elitist or not mass-oriented. Personal skills, identities and strengths were forced into a sterile mould and allowed to rot. The true strength of India was forcibly diluted. Dissent was throttled with false promises of an honourable future. It came to nought. Thankfully, an awakening has begun, identities are reasserting themselves and fresh voices are being heard again.

 Leave the bauls alone and they will sing a different tune. Send them wandering to other parts of India, to sing with the Bhands in Kashmir and the Bhopas in Rajasthan and the lyrics will change. Open the gates and welcome differences and new ideas. Celebrate real Indianness.

 RETRACE THE ROOTS

 Bona Fide Malvika Singh

 Will the great government of India pay the ridiculous duty of 30 per cent that it imposes on artefacts returning to the home country for Gandhijis letter? Or is this silly and incomprehensible rule applicable to honest Indians as well as to others who spend their hard earned money buying Indian classical and contemporary art at auctions abroad and bring them back home? It is truly perverse to mistreat citizens who care about culture and tradition and collect, not by theft but by paying market prices, objects that represent the skill and diversity of India. Sadly, the babus who control our lives are disconnected with the real strengths of this sub-continent and its people. As a result, we have allowed our heritage to fall into disrepair and decay.

 The tamashas we enact while making demands for Indian art that rests abroad, cared for and protected, is unwarranted. It smacks of fake nationalism. We should first pledge to restructure the management of our heritage, create safe repositories of our cultural traditions and then begin the fervent cry to buy back our treasures. There are no short cuts to this desperate need. It requires an urgent and staunch political commitment. Had the Padshahnama been either in private or public hands in India, it would have either been smuggled out of the country like so many other masterpieces, or been allowed to rot in some government museum basement. At Windsor, in the United Kingdom, it is being preserved by adhering to strict conservation norms so that citizens all over the world can come, view and appreciate this priceless treasure. We have many lessons to learn from contemporary cultural policies of the world.

 Working together

 First, we must cease to behave like a petulant, insecure Third World nation. Ours is an ancient culture, one that has absorbed many elements of alien cultures that came to our shores. Our strength lay in our ability to embrace and be inclusive. Alas, the bureaucratic stranglehold that has been suffocating our repositories and cultural institutions has degraded our special ethos. This stranglehold must be removed. For this, public-private partnership has to become mandatory in the management of our archives, museums as well as the various cultural academies under the control of the government and its representatives. Over the decades, many such organizations have been reduced to stomping grounds for political patronage where favoured artistes are propped up while innovative ideas fade into oblivion.

 In this year of celebration, we must pressurize the governments, both at the Centre and in the states, to restore the vast treasure trove of secular, religious, folk and classical expertise and skills and include them in the processes of change, growth and development to build a modern India which is connected to its roots, secure in its philosophies and confident to accept and function with modern systems and tools. Without this sense of being rooted, the adoption of culturally alien ideas in a globalized world will perpetuate anarchic thinking and produce erratic action. 

 In India, culture has been relegated to the backburner, while politicians and bureaucrats are wrongly spending their time to adopt a Western model for growth. The failure is evident across India, proving without doubt that we have to evolve a structure of governance that the people can comprehend and believe in, one that is inclusive of the diversity of this sub-continent.

 Professionals, and not babus, have to set fresh norms of management before we destroy the little bits and pieces that remain. There is enough money out there in the private domain and a whole host of trained professionals should be employed for this task in return of a sensible remuneration. What we need most at this hour is an intelligent partnership.

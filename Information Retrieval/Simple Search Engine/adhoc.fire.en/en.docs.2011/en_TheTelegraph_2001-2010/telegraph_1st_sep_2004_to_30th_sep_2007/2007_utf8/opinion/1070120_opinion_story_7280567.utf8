 Letters to Editor

 Still in the shadows

 Sir First Dalit to become top judge (Jan 15) is a poor way to introduce the new chief justice of India. The mention of K.G. Balakrishnans caste is redundant. He has been given the charge of the Supreme Court not because of his caste but because of his capabilities. Thus, highlighting his caste identity only betrays a kind of condescension towards the socially backward classes. The media is supposed to play a role in wiping out the caste system. Reports like this may send wrong signals to an India that is still mired in social discrimination.

 Yours faithfully,

 Kalipada Basu, Chinsurah 

 Counter offensive

 Sir The report, Racist hits make heroine of Shilpa (Jan 17), clearly shows that no matter how much progress Asians make internationally, there will always be some people who will try to demean them as a race. Such xenophobic behaviour has become more apparent after 9/11 and the London tube blasts. It was the responsibility of Channel 4 to ensure that the participants in Big Brother adhered to certain norms. Abusing someone on camera, that too, along racial lines, cannot be anyones idea of entertainment. Channel 4 seems to be using this distasteful episode to boost its ratings, caring little about offending millions worldwide. The shows chief sponsor, Carphone Warehouse, has done the right thing by withdrawing its name from the show. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nisha Agarwal, Calcutta

 Sir Shilpa Shettys plight in Celebrity Big Brother is hardly of national importance and therefore, does not deserve front-page coverage. Shetty has gone to the United Kingdom in her individual capacity to take part in the show, for which she is getting Rs 3.5 crore. So, the intervention of either the Indian or the UK government in the matter was unwarranted. The media, too, is creating an unnecessary hype around the incident. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir Why should the Indian government react officially to the comments of some ill-mannered Brits in a British TV show? This can only serve to raise Big Brothers ratings, not those of India. If Shilpa Shetty were more intelligent, she would not have got lured by the big bucks to participate in the utterly stupid show.

 Yours faithfully,

Amal Basu, Manchester, UK

 Sir Why are the media and the public up in arms when Shilpa Shetty, the alleged victim of racial discrimination and attack in Big Brother, has denied that her fellow participants remarks were of a racial nature? British Indians and Shettys fans in India may be reading too much into the issue. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.B. Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir The issue of racial abuse heaped on Shilpa Shetty brings out in the open the contradictions governing the developed nations. The West has become the breeding ground of ethnic hatred among the fair-skinned natives, who feel somewhat challenged by the rapid rise of the immigrants. Recently, the Pakistani team was at the receiving end of Herschelle Gibbss racial remarks. Now it is Shettys turn to be publicly humiliated. Indians should learn to stop aping the Western way of life.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir The invectives hurled at the Bollywood actress, Shilpa Shetty, show up the jealousy of the British inmates of the Big Brother house towards the Indian beauty. They thought Shetty would steal the show. Shetty has been remarkably tolerant and decent in the face of such insult, demonstrating the grace that Indian women are known for. Every Indian should feel proud of her.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

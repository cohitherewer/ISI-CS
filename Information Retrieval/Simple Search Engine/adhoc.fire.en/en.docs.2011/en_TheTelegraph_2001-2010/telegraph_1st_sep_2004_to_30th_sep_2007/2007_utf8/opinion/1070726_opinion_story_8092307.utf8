 Letters to Editor

 Woman in question

 Sir Pratibha Patil is the first woman president of India perhaps the only factor that goes in her favour (Hurrah: her and Harry, July 22). The presidential election this time was a charade since the winner had been decided beforehand. Patil does not reflect the peoples choice, unlike the former president. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam also enjoyed a rapport with the masses, which is unlikely to be replicated in the case of Patil. Kalam set high moral standards as president of the country. Given the skeletons in Patils cupboard, she might find it difficult to live up to these standards during her term. Given all these factors, there seems to be little reason for India to celebrate the election of its first lady president. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir Most of the ministers and legislators who voted for Pratibha Patil must have been eager to let India steal a march on the United States of America in having a woman as president. Had they thought over the suitability of Pratibha Patil a little harder, they would not have voted for her. Misplaced enthusiasm of this kind is usual in India there were m any who felt proud when Rabri Devi became the chief minister of Bihar simply because she is a woman. Such skewed thinking proves that India is yet to learn how to honour merit. 

 Yours faithfully,

Danendra Jain, Ranchi 

 Sir The mudslinging and character assassination that the Bharatiya Janata Party indulged in during the presidential polls have boomeranged upon the party itself. The BJP and its independent candidate, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, lost to Pratibha Patil by a record three lakh votes. After its chastening experience, the BJP should withdraw all the allegations it levelled against Patil and cooperate with her in constitutional matters. 

 Having a woman as the head of state is definitely going to make a strong statement for womens empowerment in India. Patil has held several prestigious posts in the course of a political career spanning over almost four decades. As the new president, she is going to add grace to the office which had long been an exclusively male domain. She can also be expected to perform her duties well, if her previous stint as the governor of Rajasthan is any indication of her abilities. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir Pratibha Patils victory is another defeat for men. The first citizen of India is now a woman. We have had a woman prime minister. Indias largest political party has a woman chief and several states have women as chief ministers.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir Sonia Gandhi has her yes-man in the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. Now, she has a yes-woman as the countrys president. Her control over the countrys politics is now absolute.

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Now that Pratibha Patil has got elected as president, she should forget all the unsavoury remarks directed at her by the Opposition during the presidential elections. After all, she will have to work with a number of those men who have tried to destroy her reputation. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir Indian democracy has belittled itself by choosing Pratibha Patil as its next president. There is no doubt that Patils election will go a long way in further reducing the regulatory powers of the president. Patil is expected to play her part of being servile to the ruling coalition headed by the Congress.

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir The unanimous support for Pratibha Patils candidature was proved by the way even parties opposed to the United Progressive Alliance came together to elect her to power. One, however, cannot help feeling a tinge of regret for the former president. The day no longer belongs to the meritorious.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir Pratibha Patils victory has been ensured not by her ability but by the directionless politics played by the Opposition, especially the BJP. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir If Pratibha Patil wants to do something to find favour with the masses against whose wishes she has been elected to power, she should declare right at the onset that she would not contest for a second term in office. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mookhi Amir Ali, Mumbai 

 Sir The Telegraphs joy over the election of the first lady president is a reflection of its immaturity. The election is not a gender game, so there is no reason to be elated over the victory of a woman.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The presidential elections were a precursor to the general elections, which are supposed to be held in two years time. Going by the huge margin by which Pratibha Patil won, the future does not bode well for the Opposition the National Democratic Alliance. The Shiv Senas decision to vote for Patil, as also the cross-voting in other BJP-ruled states like Gujarat, are ominous signs for the NDA. Unless the Opposition puts its house in order, the next elections are likely to repeat the verdict of the one in 2004.

 Yours faithfully,

Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

 Sir The heavy cross-voting in the NDA in favour of Pratibha Patil was unexpected. It seems that the electoral college voted according to its conscience. The lesson to be learnt is that when a party stoops so low as to cast aspersions on a rival candidate, it is sure to lose. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Lack of Good Sense 

 Malvika Singh 

 MALA FIDE

 On the eve of the 60th anniversary 

 of our independence, the newspaper headlines tell a dismal 

 story of where we are as a nation. I sometimes wonder if 

 the journalists are to blame or if this country truly has 

 nothing celebratory happening across its vast lands. Chances 

 are, the journalists are going for the easy option, basing 

 their stories on police handouts, the daily dose of stuff 

 that spokespeople of a myriad political parties want published, 

 playing one faction against the other, and other page three 

 type reports that tell a superficial saga of this country. 

 Most of our first pages are like those of Western tabloids, 

 sensational and dumb. More often than not it takes ten minutes 

 to read the newspaper.

 In the 60th year of independence, 

 Bhairon Singh Shekhawat has not vacated the official residence 

 of the vice- president of India. It is shameful and embarrassing. 

 Yet, when he was the chief minister of Rajasthan and had 

 to demit office, he left the official residence immediately. 

 Why then has he stayed on here? Does he want a free home 

 in Delhi and is waiting for it to be done up? Could he 

 not have moved to one of the state bhavans and set 

 a standard, instead of compelling the newly elected vice-president 

 to stay temporarily at Haryana Bhavan? Surely, those at 

 the top should act with more dignity. These small lapses 

 speak volumes about the incumbents and the values and manners 

 they live by. 

 Then there is the ongoing tirade 

 we are forced to hear, an out-of-tune orchestra conducted 

 by Prakash Karat, who waves his arms about but is unable 

 to bring a fresh and positive resonance to the music. His 

 is a dull, dreary, repetitive tune.

 University bully

 The petty threats that emanated 

 from the press conference Karat masterminded in the capital 

 endorsed that sad reality. In contrast, the prime minister, 

 Manmohan Singh, stood apart, confident of his governments 

 decision and not prepared to be bullied by Karats public 

 rhetoric that was close to rabble rousing. This government 

 has had to compromise on every issue that the Communist 

 Party of India (Marxist) has had a problem with. The latter 

 chose to remain outside the UPA alliance, but has spent 

 its time ensuring, by its constant attempt to stall all 

 decisions that do not favour its ideology, that this government 

 is incapable of strong decision-making and that there is 

 a lack of good and sensible governance. Was the Left scared 

 of joining a democratic alliance and being accountable to 

 the electorate, something it has no experience of? Is this 

 attitude one that defines an ally? To me, it defines staunch 

 opposition and the Lefts public posturing is akin to that 

 of a university bully.

 In 2007, sixty years into freedom, 

 is this an intelligent, democratic exchange of ideas that 

 could lead to relevant initiatives for development and growth? 

 Must India remain an isolated nation? Why do Karat and his 

 band of sixty in the Lok Sabha believe that they are the 

 true saviours of Hindustan even though electoral results 

 prove otherwise? Does the leadership of the CPI(M) not trust 

 the people of India? Does it see all Indians as mute followers 

 of a failed leadership, as ones who are content to wallow 

 in their unacceptable plight? Are the leaders minds closed 

 to the possibility that they may not have all the solutions, 

 that other alternatives may, in fact, be more dynamic and 

 creative, that this country is wise and civilized and knows 

 how to reject what doesnt suit it? Why this supreme condescension 

 towards the people? Why this inability to think beyond? 

 Fortunately, we are not a dictatorship 

 like the erstwhile Soviet Union and present day China. India 

 is an adjusting, maturing democracy that is going through 

 many tribulations as it seeks to extend itself positively.

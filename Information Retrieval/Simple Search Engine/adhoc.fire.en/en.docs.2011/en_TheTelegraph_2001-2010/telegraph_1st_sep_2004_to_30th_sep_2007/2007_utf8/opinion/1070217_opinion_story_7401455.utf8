 ITS ALL IN THE MIND

 This Above All 

 Khushwant Singh

 Gratify the senses

 The word andrology was new to me. Blackinsons Medical Dictionary defines it as the science of diseases of the male sex, especially of those of the male reproductive organs. What gynaecology is for women, andrology is for men. Dr Sudhakar Krishnamurty, an eminent sexologist ( I beg his pardon, andrologist) and columnist based in Hyderabad, explains its various manifestations and remedies in a book full of humorous anecdotes aptly entitled, Sex is not a Four-letter Word. Indeed, it has only three letters which are permissible in polite society whereas its four-letter counterpart, which means the same thing, is not.

 You can be sure when anyone writes about sexual maladjustments caused by impotence, hyperactive libidos, sizes of genitals, frequency of sexual encounters, quick ejaculations or no ejaculations and that sort of thing, it is assured of a large readership. In any event, we Indians are obsessed with sex for the good reason (according to the learned doctor-author) but in actual life we are not very good at it. At the end of the very first chapter is a highlighted item, Take Home Message Impotence or erectile dysfunction (ED) is usually partial rather than total. Chronic impotence is more often physical than psychological. Many diseases, most notably diabetes and high blood pressure, can cause impotence. With the worlds highest population and the worlds highest prevalence of both diabetes and heart diseases, India is arguably the impotence capital of the world. It takes your breath away. Despite widespread impotence we breed like proverbial rabbits. Perhaps our men do not get as much fun out of sex as other nationalities do. We manage to impregnate our women-folk more frequently than others.

 Some false notions persist among Indian males. One is about the size of their organs. The doctor assures that size makes marginal difference. The largest on record is eighteen inches long and six inches in circumference. Its owner was no good at it. It is how you use is that matters. Another is that masturbation is harmful. It has been established that it is natural and does no harm whatsoever. There are many other notions perpetuated by the Kama Sutra addicts which need to be debunked.

 Other additions to my vocabulary are synonyms for what we know as male menopause. They are antropause, viropause, (Adam, Padam). These refer to a man past middle age who starts eyeing young girls and makes passes at them. Many respond perhaps due to Electra complex (father-fixation). Both end up making laughing stocks of themselves.

 I was curious to know how long does sex stay on ones mind. Dr Krishnamurty assures me that men in their nineties are known to indulge in sex. I only fantasize about it. I no longer feel I am a dirty-minded old geyser. 

 The book makes good reading and is packed with useful information.

 Take heart

 Having handed over translations of my favourite Urdu poems to the publisher (I expect it to be on the bookshelves this month), there are still some words about which I am not very clear. On top of my list are dil (heart) and jigar (liver). To the best of my knowledge, they are not to be found in other Indian languages. I presume they came to Urdu from Arabic and/or Persian. Dil clearly stands for love; what does jigar signify? I have assumed it symbolizes passion or lust. They often overlap when it is powerful emotion. Urdu poets use them as separate entities when they mean the same thing. I quote two couplets of Ghalib as illustrations:

 Dil say teyree nighaah jigar

 tak uttar gayee

 Ek hee adaa mein dono ko

 razaamand ker gayee

 Your gaze travelled from my heart

 down to my liver

 And in one glance of its own fashion

 Won over my love and my passion.

 The second couplet runs as follows:

 Hairaan hoon dil ko ro-oon keh

 peetoon jigar ko main

 Maqdoor ho to saath rakhoon

 nohagar ko main

 I am baffled! Do I mourn my hearts

 demise

 Or the death of my liver?

 If I had the means, I would hire a

 professional mourner.

 Asad Mian, I too am baffled. Do I mourn my inability to understand you or do I hire a professional translator who will do the job for me?

 Cure for boredom

 There are people

 You love to meet

 To converse with them

 Is really a treat

 But alas! In every society

 Therere plenty of persons

 They can be termed

 In number of versions.

 With limited vocabulary

 And poor sense of humour

 They constantly torture us

 Like a chronic painful

 tumour

 You get tired

 Of their dull monotone

 Worse, very pointlessly

 While they chat over

 telephone

 Your visitors start narrating

 Their achievements over a

 cup of coffee

 And go on talking blah blah

 Which is like a mini

 autobiography.

 There are also women-species

 Killjoy and deadly boring

 At parties, even before

 cracking a joke

 Burst into a hysterical

 giggling

 Take a tip from me

 You wont be bored or tired

 anymore

 All that youre to do

 Set a bore to bore the other bore.

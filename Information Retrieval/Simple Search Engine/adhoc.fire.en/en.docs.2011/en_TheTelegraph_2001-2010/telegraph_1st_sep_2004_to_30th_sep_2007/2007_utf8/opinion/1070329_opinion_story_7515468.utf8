 NO FULL STOPS IN INDIA

 ROVING EYE

 Aruni Mukherjee gives a few glimpses of free India

 Scene 1: Where do you think youre going? questioned a moustached laathi-wielding guard outside one of Sir Edwin Lutyens architectural marvels the viceregal palace in New Delhi, now the Rashtrapati Bhavan.

 I have an appointment with the President of India, I replied, with a smirk on my face. I pretended to ignore the bemused look on the faces of the guards as my Ambassador taxi drove up the drive outside the gigantic concrete steps which one half-naked fakir had trod on 70-odd years ago.

 A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is everything the media portrays him to be he is intelligent, a man with a vision and a good grasp of developmental issues concerning India. I got a full dose of all his plans providing urban amenities in rural areas, infrastructure development, use of information technology to alleviate poverty and so on. I was interviewing him as part of a research project for the University of Warwick. By the time I came out, my head was spinning with facts and figures.

 Scene 2: Sitting in a small, and rather humble office, I discussed economic reforms and its effects on India with N. Narayana Murthy, till recently the chairman of Infosys. He was the only famous man in India who took the trouble of standing up and greeting me when I entered his office. There was the usual dose of praise for reforms and call for further liberalization. That Indias economic growth is based on borrowed ideas was readily accepted something Indians get very defensive about.

 Scene 3: We will not get any jobs in the new factory. We are poor and illiterate and soon will be landless. I heard this in the Jagatsinghpur district of Orissa, where the South Korean firm, Posco, is planning a 5 billion steel plant. Sitting in a mud hut in sickening heat, with crushing poverty around me, I listen to the villagers who have no say in Indias march towards breakneck industrialization. I had spent the previous month talking to bureaucrats in the Planning Commission, who spoke at length about how rural infrastructure is improving. The potholed roads in Orissa did their argument no favour.

 Scene 4: India is growing by 9 per cent a year and soon we will overtake China that is growing by 10 per cent a year. I got bombarded by another round of facts and figures from well-meaning, English-speaking students at a renowned university in Calcutta. Earlier in the month, I had seen the crowd overflowing at the newly-opened KFC outlet at the City Centre Mall in Calcutta and the Subway and McDonalds outlets in New Delhi the fads of new India. 

 Scene 5: The banks of the Sabarmati river have changed completely since 1982, when Richard Attenborough shot Gandhi. Amidst the concrete jungle, the Sabarmati Ashram is barely recognizable. I walked up to a guard and pointed out the irony of his carrying weapons in the worlds non-violent capital. 

 What to do sahib? College students come here to fool around behind the bushes, taking advantage of the peaceful surroundings, he replied.

 Watching The Last Days of the Raj on Channel 4, sitting in the heart of England, these images of todays India flashed across my mind. India has definitely seen a lot of change, but what that change is leading the country to is something we havent explored fully. What I know for sure is that Mohandas Karamchand Gandhis India is no more. The country he fought to free has ceased to exist in the 60 years since 1947. Whether Bapu would have called this freedom, I dont know. But I can guess.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Growth factor

 Sir Barry OBriens Fear is the nastiest four-letter word (Jan, 18) must be read more than once. He accurately gauges the pressure brought upon children by their over-enthusiastic parents. Parents in Calcutta and other metros desperately need guidance. Value-systems have changed with a rise in expectations. Indian parents need to realize that ambition knows no responsible boundaries. It needs to be ensured that their unreasonable demands do not harm their children and society at large. Barry OBrien seems to understand the mind of contemporary parents and their children. An India in transition would profit from more such articles. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Sen, Calcutta

 Sir As a teacher, I have been telling parents and children for the past twenty-five years the very things that Barry OBrien has spelt out. I have only been humiliated for my efforts, which have been ignored. I hope that since OBrien is well-known, people will take him seriously. However, despite being right on almost every point, OBriens analysis is incomplete. Those who might have been called normal parents even a generation ago, would not be called sensible today. Actually, most parents today have their own psychological problems, but refuse to confront them. Many have unwittingly told me that they are far more concerned about what friends and relatives might say about their childrens progress than they are about the children themselves. Sending their children to tutors for everything, from dance classes to mathematics lessons, is the norm. Good parenting is often determined by how much one spends on tuitions. The childs talents and interests do not count. 

 A frightening development is that children too are learning to adapt to the oppression. They are now quite used to running from one tutor to another without learning anything at all. They have become so lethargic and absent-minded that many cannot score even 50 per cent marks in the aggregate. After the examinations are over, they forget what they have learnt. No wonder nine out of ten of these children grow up to become incompetent and irresponsible employees in government or low-end, private concerns. The media is doing us a great disservice by constantly holding up these individuals as the ones who are going to make India great. 

 Does Barry OBrien believe that the typical parent can say sorry to his child without having a nervous breakdown first? Even if a child manages to get his parents to read this article, does the writer think that they will understand, remember and abide by his advice? 

 Yours faithfully,

Suvro Chatterjee, Durgapur

 Sir All the points made by Barry OBrien about parental expectations are, most regrettably, true. As a seventeen-year-old, I have often had quarrels with my parents, but I also understand and appreciate the fact that they do not fall into the category of deadly parents. While reading about Biswadeep Bhattacharyas death, I felt grateful that my parents deal with me in a more sensible way. However, I happen to know quite a few people of my age who are not so lucky. I feel glad that someone has taken the initiative to bring such a grave matter to notice. Childrens cries for help need to be heard. They deserve a chance to live out their own dreams. Thank you, Barry OBrien, for being our mouthpiece. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shohini Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir A humiliating punishment leaves a damaging impact on children. It could stunt their creativity and capacity for initiative, and make them lose self-esteem and respect for authority. Their ability to communicate and form emotional bonds is reduced. They internalize the violence, which has ominous implications for the society. Schools should arrange meetings with parents to discuss familial pressure on students. The school staff, including the principal, should sign a code of conduct to abjure any form of physical or verbal punishment.

 Yours faithfully,

Mary Ann Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir New Delhi will be staging the Commonwealth Games in 2010. The media, however, is intent on propagating the erroneous notion that the capital will become a global city after the Games. The important question is why the Commonwealth Games are being held here is it to improve the standard of sports in India or to improve the infrastructure of New Delhi? If the objective is the latter, it could have been served by spending less than half the amount, especially since it is uncertain whether big sports events do anything to improve Indias sporting standards. Will the choice of Delhi as the Commonwealth Games venue make India win more medals in the 2012 Olympics? India has always spent more on sports than it has got returns for. Let us not bid for the Olympics unless we are more sure of our medals prospects. 

 Yours faithfully,

E.M. Adithyan, Edapal, Kerala

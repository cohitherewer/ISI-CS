 HOW TO WIN IT

 One is tempted to borrow the Indian psephologists favourite term for the situation in the United States of America. The anti-incumbency factor seems to be already at work. It has substantially undercut the war-weary Republicans standing in both the houses of the Congress and bequeathed to them the unpleasant experience of having to stand up to inquisitions by Americas first lady speaker of the House of Representatives. Quite naturally, Ms Hillary Clinton, former first lady and the foremost Democrat candidate, smells victory. She can only be in it to win it. The preparations for Ms Clintons entry into the presidential race, although announced recently, had long been underway. Her grooming as a future politician had taken place in the White House itself, as her president-husbands chief planner of the health-care reforms. She has, subsequently, won two Senate elections on her own steam with a significant majority. And now, with her experience, connections, the political acumen and fund-raising capabilities of her husband, and her own charisma (that attracted two gymna- siums-full of Iowans at her first road show), Ms Clinton is definitely a formidable adversary for any contender for the worlds most coveted post. As winning gambits, these, and not so much her gender, are likely to prove more productive. Ms Clinton is too wise not to know that. 

 She is also most likely to know about the fickleness of the American voter, who would reserve the liberty to make a choice till the last lap of the presidential race, when themes and faces come together in the public imagination. Ms Clintons is undoubtedly a well-known face, but there are chances of it being upstaged by that of Mr Barack Obama, the African-American Democrat contestant, who has added both colour and verve to the game already. On the dominant themes the war and the economy Ms Clinton may be unable to strike a chord too different from the others. For America, Iraq is a reality which provides no easy escape. This is also why a warring nation may yet stop itself from electing a woman to direct its operations. There is, again, still time for the present dispensation to prove that the economy is not as sick as it looks. All of which means that Ms Clinton will have to think up new lines to harp on if she wishes her voters to help her win it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IMAGE OF A SICK SOCIETY

 Malvika Singh

 The killings in Noida that went on despite endless complaints to the police, have numbed the civilized and the sensitive. This recent horror has put the law and order forces of India, particularly those of Uttar Pradesh, into sharp focus. It has established without doubt their participation in and quiet endorsement of crime for money a truth that has plagued us for decades because the rulers of this land have turned a blind eye to the numerous criminal operations that have overwhelmed and suffocated citizens.

 The men and women in power, who have been non-committal and have ignored these ongoing atrocities, should feel guilty and repentant for having allowed and perpetuated such gross assaults on the innocent and exploited citizenry. As the authority rapidly gets exposed for being corrupt, for condoning all that is illegal and wrong, for actively protecting criminals, for consistently misusing the law, for bending before money and brawn, the people of this country are sick in the stomach with the predictable shenanigans of that elite tribe one which administers arbitrarily, disregarding all except its selfish ends.

 It is alleged that the lucrative trade in human organs is what motivated the mass killings and that the stories being put out to an eager-beaver press are an attempt to detract public attention from the real issue. Who is protecting what? Who in India believes that the police did not know what was happening? People are not fools and know well how criminals are protected in our country. Most have a fair idea of the unpublished rate card for such activities. 

 Todays celebrities

 Everyone knows that the police take their hafta everywhere, wherever they can pull rank because they don the uniform of the state and threaten honest men and women who do not fall in line with their illegal demands. Nobody chooses to do anything about it, because those who could act are imprisoned within a steel frame called government that is manipulated by government servants, better known as babus, who fight vehemently for the status quo and, with it, their survival.

 The Indian civil service was a forerunner of the Indian administrative service. The former was civil. The latter, unfortunately, seems to have created and nurtured a breed called the babu, represented by men and women who administer at the will of their political masters. Today they have begun to do so regardless of right or wrong. They have ceased to do what the ICS was known to do advise ministers, ensure that the law is upheld to protect the citizen and not allow any form of exploitation. Today, currying favour, becoming partners in administrative, economic and political crime, bending and rewriting rules to suit personal needs disregarding societal compulsions, have reduced India to a virtual banana republic with no governmental checks and balances. This dangerous disconnection with the people of India and their needs, the abuse of safe habitats and environment, is compelling social anarchy.

 Endless committees have been instituted to examine and recommend administrative reform. Its members come either from this corroded service or from the failed political class, both of which want no change, because any real change will expose them to a fate worse than permanent exile. This is no breaking news. This is a familiar, everyday reality, one that has made the poor poorer and the rich richer since one lot could not buy their protection, in the broadest possible definition, and the other lot could do so with ease. An entrepreneurial middle class found innovative ways and means to beat a corrupt system and do business to survive and grow. India saluted all those who broke the law and made good. The celebrities of today are those who took the rate of growth up and up!

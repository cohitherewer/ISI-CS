 Letters to Editor

 Have stick, will hit

 Hit and run

Sir Insanity born out of religious intolerance once again reared its ugly head in the vandalism carried out by members of the Hindu Rashtra Sena on the Star News headquarters in Mumbai (Attack on channel, April 17). Instances of such attacks on the media are not difficult to find. A lot of people are inconvenienced by the role that the media plays in society making the public aware of the true picture behind the official version of events. As a result, the media have repeatedly faced the ire of political parties in recent times, with journalists being assaulted, cameras broken and newspaper offices ransacked. Star News was attacked because the channel had aired a story about fundamentalist groups opposing the relationship between a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy from Surat. The incident only confirms the fanaticism of these groups. 

 However, the media are not totally blameless, since they tend to sensationalize events. Of late, the print media have been giving more attention to the Bachchan family wedding than to urgent political issues. The media need to be more circumspect about which news stories they should put emphasis on. 

 Yours faithfully,

Biranchi Narayan Acharya, Cuttack

 Sir The editorial, Muscling in (April 18), expresses the view of most Indians when it says that the more India changes, the more it remains the same. While globalization is supposed to have created a generation of very modern young people, there are groups which still believe that religious difference can be reason enough to keep two persons apart. The fanaticism displayed by the group which raided the Mumbai office of Star News is beyond condemnation. It proves yet again that India is still a land of bigoted beliefs. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Kumar, Calcutta 

 Sir By Star Newss own admission, the girl from Surat who had eloped with her lover was a minor, which would make her elopement a case of kidnapping. The channels duty was to hand over the couple to the police instead of displaying them on screen. It may have increased Star Newss viewership, but the channel should have known that it would be fodder for fundamentalist forces. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir The youths who attacked the Star News office need to be brought to book immediately. At the same time, Star News need not have highlighted the incident involving the young boy and girl from Surat in the way it did. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, CAlcutta

 Danger round the bend

 Sir The report, Army dash for foreign minister (April 9), provides a description of the injury suffered by Pranab Mukherjee and the medical treatment he received, in graphic detail. But one wonders about the fate of the non-VIPs who were involved in the crash. It is reported that Gautam Yadav, the driver of the lorry that rammed into Mukherjees car, was arrested but did he, as well as the ministers driver, escape unhurt? If they were injured, did they receive even a fraction of the attention that was heaped upon Mukherjee? 

 The doctors of Bengals district hospitals like the one in Shaktinagar where Mukherjee was taken after the accident are known to be apathetic and inefficient. But when the patient happened to be a Union minister, all of them jumped into action. One hopes that henceforth, even non-VIPs will get such efficient service. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil Kumar Pal, London, UK

 Sir Pranab Mukherjees road accident highlights, albeit indirectly, the pitiable status of healthcare in West Bengal. The hasty removal of an injured Mukherjee to Delhi from the districts of West Bengal clearly establishes the lack of trust in the medical services available in the state. When the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, makes tall claims about the improvement of medical facilities in the state, he should be reminded that the leaders of the Central government (even when they are from Bengal) obviously think otherwise. Or, Mukherjee would have completed his treatment in a state hospital. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir Any accident is unfortunate, but the one Pranab Mukherjee met with is the result of a history of negligent governance. The NH 34 between Krishnagar and Plassey, on which Mukherjee was travelling at the time of the accident, is in a dismal state, dotted with potholes. And as pointed out in the report, Mishap blame on narrow road (April 10), the highway has been narrowed by encroachments on both sides. In addition to this, there is the threat of huge trucks regularly violating the stipulated limit. In the absence of regular patrols, these recklessly driven trucks cause frequent accidents.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ramakrishnan, Calcutta

 Sir It is a tribute to the spirit of Pranab Mukherjee that he can be cheerful and talk of getting back to work just three days after a dreadful road accident (PM monitoring care, Pranab talkative, April 9). His will-power and sense of responsibility is an example that all politicians should follow. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Day of the gun

Guns and minarets

 Sir It is appalling to learn that the chief cleric of Islamabads Lal Masjid tried to escape clad in a burqa (Mosque chief in aunty garb; Big catch and surrender in Pakistan, July 5). Is this what one would expect from a man who supposedly preaches the tenets of Islam? In the first place, he had put the lives of hundreds of students inside the mosque at risk by inspiring them to take up arms and defy the government. Through his radicalism, the cleric, Abdul Aziz Ghazi, had also endangered the lives of ordinary Pakistani citizens and raised fears of civil war and terrorism. However, if Ghazi indeed believed in his own radical views, why did he attempt to run away in disguise? Ghazi is a hypocrite who, for all his puritanism, did not have the courage to surrender to security personnel. The likes of Ghazi, who spread violence in the name of religion, need to be condemned from the pulpits. It is time to uphold the humanity of all religions and not divide and monopolize god. 

 Yours faithfully,

Simi Aziz, Calcutta

 Sir The Lal Masjid episode is a warning to Pervez Musharraf. Although it is an internal affair of Pakistan, the international community must raise its voice for a democratically-elected government there. Only a democratic Pakistan would expose the hypocrisy of wearing a burqa and wielding a gun. While many Muslims willingly choose the burqa, a freer and more liberal society would surely make the burqa redundant. Besides, none other than a cleric has just misused the garment. Religious fundamentalism is best combated by making the masses see sense. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir The supposed attempt on Pervez Musharrafs life confirms the fact that the anti-Musharraf camp is still active in Pakistan and doing rather well. Undoubtedly, the presidents move against the armed men inside the Lal Masjid has further antagonized his enemies. But the real danger is the possible outbreak of violence all over Pakistan. Musharraf has had many fortunate escapes, but he may not be lucky every time. Perhaps he can best protect himself by relinquishing power and allowing a democratic polity to emerge again. Of course, whoever runs Pakistan needs to rein in the fundamentalists. Perhaps Musharraf should pick up a few things from Indira Gandhis Operation Blue Star. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir It is Pakistans tragedy and the worlds misfortune that the country is caught between a dictator and fundamentalists (The siege within, July 8). How armed fanatics could be allowed a free run for decades is beyond comprehension. Even if the Pakistani authorities justify the existence and activities of the Lal Masjid in the Eighties in the fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, its survival henceforth is evidence of the Wests double standards and the hopelessness of Pakistans socio-political destiny. Pervez Musharraf knows that he needs to smash the jihadis. But he also knows that, paradoxically, he needs those very jihadis to keep the democratic-liberal forces at bay. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.N. Basu, Siliguri

 Sir The Lal Masjid episode makes me wonder about what the government of India would have done if a mosque here was being used as haven for radical activists? Any armed action would have set off wails and war-cries from Morocco to Indonesia, only to be matched by our own home-grown practitioners of sectarian as well as pseudo-secular politics. It is a matter of wonder that the Islamic radicals of India have not taken to the streets yet, demanding the ouster of Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan. On the global front, the progress of the Glasgow investigations in Britain points towards the trend of suspicion on the basis of religious identities. If this trend picks up, less jobs will be available to Muslim youth, driving them into the welcoming arms of the jihadis. This mass branding must be stopped. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Datta, Calcutta

 The correct fort

 Sir In the review of the book, A Teardrop on the Cheek of Time: The Story of the Taj Mahal (Reflections on the nature of grief, love and immortality, July 6), Chirosree Basu writes that Shah Jahan was imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb, in the Red Fort. This is not true. It is a well-known fact that the emperor was imprisoned by Aurangzeb in the Agra Fort. During the last days of his life, Shah Jahans only job was to watch the Taj from an opening in the walls of the Agra Fort. Therefore the question of him being imprisoned in the Red Fort does not arise.

 Yours faithfully,

Saghir Asad, Calcutta

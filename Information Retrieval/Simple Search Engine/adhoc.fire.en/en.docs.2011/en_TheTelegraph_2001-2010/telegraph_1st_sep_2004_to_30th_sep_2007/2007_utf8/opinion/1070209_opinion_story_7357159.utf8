 Letters to Editor

 Sound and fury

 Sir Much has already been written about Mamata Banerjees lack of political sense or vision. However, she seems to have remained unperturbed by her detractors (Back: Mamata amp; bedlam, Feb 5). In fact, she looks revitalized by her fast, given the vigour with which she has resumed her unfinished job. Provoking the poor people of Singur against the small car project might turn the limelight on her for a while, but she certainly does not have any idea of the consequences. She is likely to stumble again, and be frustrated eventually. One can almost predict the sequence in which her protest is going to unfold, beginning with bandhs, followed by angry demonstrations, burning of the chief ministers effigies, and then her final refuge on the fasting stage. The stage should be built this time near the Writers Buildings to spare the office-goers the daily traffic snarls. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sankardas Mukherjee, Bhopal

 Sir Mamata Banerjee is a great spoiler. On the one hand, she insists that the government of West Bengal should create more opportunities for employment, while on the other hand, she wants to stop the Tata group from proceeding with the work on its small car factory. Banerjee surely knows that industrialization creates new jobs. She should stop her silly games and help the state move along the path of development.

 Yours faithfully,

Sankar Chatterjee, Canberra, Australia 

 Sir It is exasperating that after the series of bandhs and strikes interrupted normal life in the city for the past couple of months, more trouble seems to be in store. Mamata Banerjees renewed protests against the Tata Motors factory in Singur is a sure sign of that. Her activities will only delay West Bengals economic resurgence, and the sooner she understands this, the better. The Tata group is currently the fifth largest steel company in the world. This, at least, should make Banerjee wake up to the magnitude of the development that this group can usher into the state.

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir The Tata groups success in acquiring the British steel giant, Corus, is a proud moment in the history of Indian business. Mamata Banerjee, however, has no reason to let this achievement deter her from going ahead with her agitation plans, since the latter, in any case, is unlikely to yield any result. With the boost to the Tata image following the takeover, it will be more difficult for Banerjee and her friends to make the people see her point. She should have accepted the proposal of the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, for a dialogue and resolved the Singur issue without further delay.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir Mamata Banerjees one-point agenda is to take an opposite view on every decision taken by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. She is stuck with the Singur issue, even when she knows that she cannot change the governments decision. She may have a point in defending the farmers who are being forced to leave their lands, but her fight lacks a strong base. How can she win? 

 It is not that we should not be concerned about the emotions of the people, but not at the cost of the countrys growth. Mamata Banerjee does not seem to be interested in the development of the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Barely decent

 Sir The love for sensationalism and publicity makes people do weird things (Sir, this exceeds the brief, Feb 3). Unfortunately, the media pamper them by highlighting their farcical actions. This has certainly been the case with Rakesh Agarwal, who stripped to his undergarments at a convention where the prime minister was speaking. Civil society generally follows a consensus in the way its members dress. Similarly, it also places certain restrictions on the manner of protest against authority. Some of these etiquettes are codified while others are left to the individuals discretion. By his conspicuous misdemeanour before an august assembly, Agarwal has made himself look ludicrous, as well as insulted Indian culture and tradition. He is yet to learn that stronger and effective protests can be staged without tearing the veneer of civilized behaviour. The ridiculous episode could have been avoided had the security personnel been more competent. But the media should not waste their space to report such antics.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir Rakesh Agarwals protest against the Centres plans to remove file notings from the ambit of the Right to Information Act, by disrobing in front of prime minister, was in very bad taste. He is either insane or dying to get some media attention. The Special Protection Group was right in arresting him not only for his act, but also because someone as frenzied as him could have been dangerous to the prime minister and other dignitaries. The courts ought to punish Agarwal for misusing his freedom of expression.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

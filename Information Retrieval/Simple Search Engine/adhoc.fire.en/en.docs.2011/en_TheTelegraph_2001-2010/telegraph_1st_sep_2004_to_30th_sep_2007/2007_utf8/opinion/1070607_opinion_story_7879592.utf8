 The last roar

 Sir The fact that the famed Indian tiger is now on the brink of extinction can be attributed to the governments failure to protect the forest and its animals ( Shed a tear for the tiger, May 24). In India, politicians and legislators care for nothing else other than votes. Unfortunately, tigers do not vote. Consequently, the government continued to look the other way, even as the Indian tiger fell prey to the poachers bullets. A hundred years ago, there were some forty thousand tigers roaming in Indias forests. Today, they number a few thousands. But poaching alone has not brought tigers close to extinction. There is also the factor of Indias burgeoning population, which puts enormous pressure on the forests that have remained. Worse, a majority of Indias population is poor and is indifferent to the plight of animals or to matters relating to conservation and ecology. The police, over-burdened and understaffed, have little time or zeal to arrest or punish poachers. The government, however, must ensure that the tiger survives before it is too late. Perhaps, it would be a good idea to constitute a special court along with a police force to protect the forests from the timber mafia and poachers. The poor have been rendered voiceless in this country. So it now up to the rich to take up the cudgels and force the government to put a stop to the cruel slaughter of tigers and other wild animals. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir There are a few tigers that remain in the wild today. This is certainly a cause of concern not only for environmental activists but also for the government. In the earlier days, the kings used to hunt animals as a sport. They were followed by the British who loved bloodsports as well. After independence, things began to look up for a while. The government passed a law banning the killing of some species that were threatened with extinction. But the situation has taken a turn for the worse once again. Trading in skin and body parts is a lucrative business in India as well as in other countries such as China. This has resulted in poachers killing animals for money. As a result, many species, including the tiger, are dying out. In order to save the tiger, the authorities need to raise awareness levels by holding campaigns in the media. Stricter enforcement of laws related to poaching can also help save the Indian tiger from certain death.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The number of several other species, including the tiger, is dwindling in India. This has to do with human encroachment on forests and the threat posed by poachers. There has been a lot of talk to tackle poaching but the government has failed to come out with a concrete plan to end the menace. Take for instance the case against Salman Khan, who was accused of killing protected animals. The case is still pending before the court and the actor has filed appeals against his conviction. This example is enough to point out that in India, the rich and the famous can get away with serious crimes such as poaching. If the authorities had managed to punish Khan, it would have acted as an effective deterrent. The prime minister must look into this problem personally. Only that can help save the day for Indias tigers.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir Swapan Dasguptas article, Shutting their doors (June 1), paints a grim future for two of Indias largest national parties the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. However, it is difficult to agree with Dasguptas prediction, which, I think, is a little far-fetched. It is true that the Bahujan Samaj Party, led by the irrepressible Mayavati, has managed to score a resounding victory in Uttar Pradesh. However, the election results notwithstanding, it is a bit premature to conclude that the BJP and the Congress will be routed at the hustings in the next general elections. In fact, the BSPs impressive victory has given the two national parties an opportunity to rethink and rework their strategy before the country faces the ballot again. 

 Every state in India has certain specific problems pertaining to it. Hence, it would be better for the Congress and the BJP to focus on the state specific problems in order to improve their electoral prospects. Simply stating that India is shining or holding out promises for the aam aadmi would not do. 

 Unlike Dasgupta, I am of the firm belief that the BJP or the Congress will form the next government at the Centre. This is simply because regional parties do not have the numbers or the experience to win the coveted seat of power in Delhi. 

 Yours faithfully,

 T.V. Ramanarayanan,Calcutta

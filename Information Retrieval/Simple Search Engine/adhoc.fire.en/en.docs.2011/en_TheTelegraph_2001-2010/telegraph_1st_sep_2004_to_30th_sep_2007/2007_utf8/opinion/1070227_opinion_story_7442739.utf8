 THE INDIAN SHUFFLE

 Malvika Singh

 The presentation of the budget has become like some rather dull and monotonous festival with all and sundry involved in endless chitter-chatter about what should or should not be done in relation to the economic and fiscal policy of this young-and-struggling-to-grow nation. In most other countries of the world, budgets are a statement of account, revenue and expenditure of the government. Here, it has unfortunately become a rather riotous occasion during which all manners of populist packages are introduced, goodies doled out in previous years such as tax-cuts and exemptions are revoked and fresh candies distributed, all of which can been seen through by the voter and citizen, who knows well that these are mere charades played out and that the government is never accountable for what it sets out to do. All that has happened over the last decades is natural growth despite, and inspite of, governmental shenanigans. It is time we treated the budget as a budget, not as an exercise in announcing policy initiatives that, more often than not, are recalled the following year. Our national dance, The Indian Shuffle, one-step-forward-three-steps-back, has exhausted and crippled this country for far too long. 

 The Communist Party of India (Marxist), sitting desperately on a rickety fence that encircles the compound of the present coalition government, has reduced the politics of consensus, debate and discourse, to sheer blackmail. If coalitions are here to stay, a mantra chanted by most of the intellectuals who form the think-tanks, then so is ideological blackmail, a bully tactic that belongs to an age past. It is sad to watch the round table discussions on our television screens as politicians, academics, economists and the intelligentia alike, blab on predictably, voicing the same old jargon of fifty years ago, the same ideas marginally modified, asking for the same useless solutions that have failed us all, trying to keep alive the failed ideas and processes and the intellectual baggage of a dead generation. 

 Brainwashed

 Some parties have managed to successfully infuse their new and young cadres with the archaic ideas of half a century ago. These younger people sound like voices echoing from the dead. Robot-like, chanting the rote, much like religious fanatics delivering their sermons with their ears and eyes shut, these young men and women have aged before their time. Not a new idea, not a new slogan, not a new aspiration for the people, not a new experiment introduced that could be a challenge and possibly trigger change. Those aware of the political and social situation in India, know how these people are going to respond and react to any and every question they are asked! 

 The CPI(M) is, in fact, running the united progressive alliance government. It is forcing policy. It is unrelenting in its positions. It is enjoying being at the helm of power without the mandatory responsibility and accountability. And the UPA seems unashamed about this glaring truth. Bills have been pushed through with voice-vote, the members having been given only a few hours to read the amendments. Infiltration, political and administrative, has been deft. Manipulation laced ingeniously with populist jargon has converted many. This marginal party has used its 60 seat strength in parliament to stall whatever it chooses to without even an attempt at setting the agendas for public debate and scrutiny. Dictatorial and old fashioned, this party has intervened in a negative fashion, much to the dismay of those who were against the equivalent right parties in the realm of Indian politics. They are identical twins, anti-liberal, anti-democratic, stuck in insular rhetoric without having delivered the goods. In the end, respect for diversity will win not the static rigidity of an ideology that may need adjusting in a changed world.

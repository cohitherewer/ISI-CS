 A PLAN THAT CANNOT WORK

 Malvika Singh

 The Delhi master plan is out and notified but experts, architects and town-planners, not employed by the government, say that it is not a master plan at all. It is a mere reiteration of chaos and a lack of planning for now as well as the future. There is no zonal-and area-planning, no detailing for specific streets and colonies, no thought for growth and traffic movement, no consideration of the diminishing infrastructure and its impact on this great and historic city, one of the finest in the world. The reason for this complete lack of understanding on the part of the authority stems from the scary reality that the members of that authority just do not know any better. It is not their chosen profession, they are not all trained in urban planning, nor is it their expertise. The government must bring in the best in the business and not expect its employees, who may not have the experience, new ideas, and profound aesthetics, all of which are essential to deliver a world class metropolis.

 To destroy a legacy because of a lack of comprehension of the needs of the people in a changed time and age is criminal. The government has failed miserably to ensure a decent and environment-friendly habitat, in the absence of an aesthetic sensibility governing growth or an ability to review archaic and stupid by-laws. On the other hand, the judiciary intervenes every day in urban issues that need scientific scrutiny by accessing multidisciplinary professions and skills and not mere judgments. India is being pushed by this kind of short-sighted behaviour and action into total urban chaos and anarchy that will escalate into a severe law and order problem. 

 Creative mind

 All interventions so far are selfish and motivated. Social dignity is not important in this present scheme. The attempt is to legalize the illegal and send out a reinforced signal that if you break the rule and bribe your way, one day in the future the illegal activity you have indulged in will be forgiven and you will be exonerated. Is this not an establishment of improprieties and bad values, one that will create the badlands of the future?

 There is a silly rule that governs Delhi today that children cannot play in the colony gardens. There could not be a more foolish rule than this one. It does not even merit a further comment but it does speak volumes about those who make the rules. Instead of involving the community in the greening and maintenance of the street where you live, municipalities forbid you to grow a hedge, or plant a tree, or lay grass on a patch outside the gate that belongs to the state. They believe that the citizen will usurp that public space. This speaks volumes about the inability of the authority to enforce laws with honesty and integrity. If you are fortunate to have a garden and you put a greenhouse in that lawn, it is counted as covered area, only so that some Johnny can collect a regular remuneration. One could go on and on forever recounting such absurd laws, rules and by-laws. Experience has shown how you can merrily break all laws by passing monies to the authority. And, having said that, the people who break them first and set the example are those who make them our leaders and their babus.

 The ridge has been handed over to the builders lobby. Illegalities of the past are being legalized and there is an attempt to make all those wrongs into rights for the future. There is no street- and area-zoning. The whole exercise is a farce and in the process, as the demolitions continue, vested interests like feuding families, squabbling over property, are busy using demolition squads to settle personal scores. Thats the fresh avenue for income generation. How ingenious and creative the babus can be!

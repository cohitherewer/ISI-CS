 LONG ROAD

 The time has finally come for the Maoists in Nepal to re-write the countrys and their own history. In a few days they are supposed to join the interim government in Kathmandu. When that happens, it will mark the first major triumph of the peace process in Nepal. A long road to a historic change will still lie ahead for them and the democratic parties. Momentous decisions have to be taken about a new constitution, the nature of the state and, above all, about the fate of the monarchy. Compared to all these, the distribution of portfolios for Maoist ministers should have been treated as a small matter. But if the Maoists are bargaining over portfolios, they obviously have other motives. The first thing that the government has to do now is hold the elections to the constituent assembly in June. The Maoists clearly hope that important portfolios such as defence, home and finance, in addition to the post of a deputy prime minister, will help them in the polls. It would be unfair to deny the Maoists a leading role in the restoration of democracy in Nepal. The prime minister, Mr Girija Prasad Koirala, cannot afford to ruin the peace process by allowing the parties to settle small scores with the Maoists. On the contrary, he needs to ensure that nothing goes wrong in the run-up to the crucial elections to the constituent assembly. 

 The warning is not out of place. Certain events have cast a shadow over both the peace process and the forthcoming elections. The first major political trouble to shake Nepal since the peace agreement with the Maoists was the ethnic violence in the Terai region. It threatened to divide the people of the hills from those of the plains. Worse still, pro-monarchy elements sought to exploit the violence in their attempts to subvert peace and democracy. The Maoists themselves were to blame for causing some misgivings about their intentions. The fear that the rebels have not surrendered all their weapons still hangs over the country. The Maoist leader, Prachanda, harmed the cause of peace by publicly claiming that the rebels still retained the capacity to launch four simultaneous attacks if they wanted it. It is no secret that they continue to terrorize the people and extort money from them. But Mondays massive protests in Kathmandu against Maoist terror are a good omen for democracy. No people submit forever to the fear of the gun.

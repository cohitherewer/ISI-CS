 The eagles have not landed

 Sir The report, Waiting, for the eagles to land, (Jan 2), took me back to the mid-fifties when I visited the Vedagirishwarar temple with my parents. We saw two eagles circling overhead, and, later, they came down to eat from the pots held out by the priest. The birds, if I remember correctly, were black, and we were told that they took a bath in Benaras in the morning and flew all the way to the hill shrine by lunch time. It is sad that the eagles have stopped coming. But the place is still worth a visit, if only for its enchanting beauty.

 Yours faithfully,

 Ashok Ghosh, Calcutta

 Just a show

 Sir Mamata Banerjee decided to call off her twenty-five-day hunger strike (From darkness, Mamata back in limelight, Dec 30). One does not really know what compelled the Trinamool Congress leader to end her fast. Perhaps, she realized, a little too late in the day, that the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would not give in to pressure. Luckily for Mamata, the letters from the prime minister and the president gave her an opportunity to save her face. 

 Banerjee has never been known to do anything constructive for West Bengal, despite her long and illustrious political career. The protest movements that she has launched have all been done to bolster her political image. Worse, matters related to the economy have never been her forte. What Banerjee refuses to understand is that the factory at Singur will generate employment for thousands of unemployed youth. More important, such a venture also has the potential to change the economy of the region. True, some villagers will have to part with their land, but the government will ensure that they are compensated adequately. Banerjee is trying to ensure that West Bengal remains dependent on agriculture. Her brand of politics would also keep investors away from Bengal. Banerjees behaviour evokes memories of Indira Gandhi. Like her, Banerjee too takes all decisions by herself, despite the fact that she is the leader of a democratic party comprising senior politicians. Some politicians are still supporting Banerjee because of petty, selfish interests. None of these leaders care for the welfare of West Bengal and its people.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Mamata Banerjees fast was nothing but political blackmail. However, the people of Bengal are no strangers to Banerjees antics. Ever since her entry into politics, the electorate has witnessed similar irresponsible acts on the part of this firebrand leader. But the governments reaction to the hunger strike called by Banerjee was equally thoughtless. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his colleagues, it appears, were confident that they would win the Singur farmers on to their side with ease. As a result, they did not pay enough attention to their grievances. This helped Banerjee to bring a local issue on to the stage of national politics. Perhaps, it would not be wrong to say that Banerjee has come out with flying colours on the Singur issue, while the government has been left with egg on its face. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees handling of the Singur issue has undoubtedly raised doubts over his political acumen.

 Yours faithfully,

 S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir Supporters of the Trinamool Congress may gloat about the fact that it took an appeal from the prime minister to make Banerjee end her fast. However, it is still not clear whether Banerjees fast would help the farmers in any way. But what is evident is that her hunger strike was aimed at recovering lost political ground. If Banerjee is worried about the farmers fate, she should shun populist strategies in favour of a serious political movement.

 Yours faithfully,

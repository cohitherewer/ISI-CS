The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TEACH THE MAYOR

 The 2007 budget has set aside quite a bit of money for HIV/AIDS. But is funding really the problem in India? A great deal of money has been coming in from foreign funding agencies and organizations, and a considerable amount has been allocated over the last few years by the Central and state governments. But most of the public, particularly governmental, discourse on HIV/AIDS in this country has to do with fighting over numbers: how bad is the Indian situation in comparison with, say, South Africa? Defending the governments achievements in international fora seems to be a major task here. But the most alarming indication of all this funding not being properly spent is in the little change in awareness levels regarding HIV/AIDS in India, especially at the most important levels: in medical personnel and the political leadership. West Bengal is the state in which two recent and most disgraceful instances of this have taken place.

 First, Calcuttas specialist government hospitals have refused, one after another, to operate on a thalassaemic child who has caught the infection from the blood he has been transfused with at a government hospital. Second, Calcuttas mayor, Mr Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, has deemed that employees of the Calcutta Corporation will have to take life-long leave (with pay) if they have been detected as living with HIV/AIDS. The outrageousness of such a decision becomes even more so when it is packaged to the public as an act of grace. The mayor believes that it will be better for such a person to remain at home with his or her family rather than being at work. When benighted prejudice and ignorance masquerades as being humane, and that too, brazenly in public, using the authority of a prominent political position, then the offence and the damage become incalculable. Apart from the violation of a number of employees rights (people living with HIV/AIDS are still legally rather badly protected), the mayors attitude lives out a number of erroneous notions regarding rehabilitation and, at a deeper level, the supposed risks of working with someone who is living with HIV/AIDS. Quite a bit of the money that has been allocated for HIV/AIDS in this years budget should be spent on educating the educated and empowered, for the terrible examples they set are far more actively dangerous than the ignorance of the masses.

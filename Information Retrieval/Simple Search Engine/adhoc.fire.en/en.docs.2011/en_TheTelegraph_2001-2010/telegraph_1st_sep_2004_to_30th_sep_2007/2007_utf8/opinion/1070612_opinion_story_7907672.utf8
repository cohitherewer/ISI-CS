The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SAME OLD STORY 

 MALAFIDE

 Malvika Singh

 The 

 Indian media and the BJP have gone nuts, yet again, over 

 a court ruling in Argentina that prevents, without any hesitation, 

 the extradition of Ottavio Quattrocchi, the wanted man 

 on the Bofors gun deal, to India. It has become a farcical 

 charade that will continue without resolution even after 

 the guns have become obsolete. If the electronic media, 

 the opposition, public servants and administrators, who 

 are mandated to ensure the rights of citizens, spent the 

 same amount of time and energy in exposing the corrupt practices 

 in government offices, in making sure that the infrastructure 

 works with honesty and integrity, like it does elsewhere 

 in the world, a renewal of faith in the system would be 

 happening. Instead, the men and women in power, who have 

 failed to restore good practice and clean operation in their 

 own governments, have spent years gunning for one family 

 on the basis of hearsay without adequate proof that can 

 hold in a court of law.

 The opposition goes on without 

 any solid evidence. Stories pop up and then disappear, giving 

 way to new stories on the gun deal. The CBI has, in the 

 process, discredited itself in the eyes of the ordinary 

 people. Since this entire exercise has taken on the form 

 of a rather flimsy case, the alleged kickback pales in comparison 

 to the money expended over the years in trying to find the 

 money. Many of the accused have died. When the BJP ruled 

 for a full term with Atal Bihari Vajpayee, an astute politician, 

 at the helm, why did the NDA not ensure that the case was 

 taken to its conclusion? Why did it prevaricate? Who was 

 it protecting?

 Lets get real

 While accusing the Gandhis and 

 the Congress for indulging in a cover-up, surely the opposition 

 should take a look at its own performance. Why the inaction 

 for five years? Or, is this just a game, Bofors Bogey, usually 

 played when these men are running out of steam? They appear 

 to take a vicarious pleasure at the thought of demeaning 

 the widow of a former prime minister, one who was exonerated 

 on the issue by the court, because they assume wrongly that 

 she is a vulnerable woman. What story are they going to 

 spread about the judge in Argentina? What will be the new 

 accusation? Lets get real.

 The critical question in all of 

 this is why do they, the town criers, not expose the corruption 

 happening under our noses each moment of the day, corruption 

 that has destroyed this nation and its ethics? Why the silence 

 on kickbacks that are intrinsic to a majority of deals? 

 Why the silence on government corruption and extortion each 

 time there is a public-private partnership? Why the silence 

 on the never-ending haftas? Why this subjective morality? 

 Why this hypocrisy? Does it stem from a deep-seated fear 

 that they have about the first family a reference they 

 make about the Gandhis at all press conferences?

 Such Indian politicians come across 

 as simple-minded, intellectually-limited, unable to exercise 

 the mind beyond petty issues and inept at getting the facts 

 rights. It saddens one to watch and tolerate this ineffective 

 calibre of individuals who have entered the political arena. 

 The sense they exude is that of failure. They settle for 

 easy options in public life and are exploitative. They get 

 an undeserved status in the society, freebies from the government, 

 much bowing and scraping at their feet from those who need 

 help because the administration and system are corrupt.

 All of this reduce them into strange, 

 self-serving robots. One cannot see any commitment, energy 

 or dynamism in their personas that would have raised the 

 confidence of citizens about their ability to take India 

 towards a vigorous and vital future. This is only one example 

 of the politics of revenge, of personal vendetta, of political 

 scores being settled at the cost of India by those mandated 

 to serve the nation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FAIR VICTORY

 The divinitys name should not be taken in vain. The 11 members of Madhya Pradeshs legislative assembly who had written Om or Jai Shri Ram on their ballot papers in support of the Bharatiya Janata Party-backed independent presidential candidate, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, may be ruing their excessive piety. Their votes were invalid. Not that their validity would have made much difference to the result. Pratibha Patil won the presidential election with a margin of three lakh votes. After the general restiveness at the poor outcome of the United Progressive Alliances quietly frantic search for an acceptable or compromise candidate for president, this is not at all a mean achievement. India now has its first woman president. And the worms in the can have all come wriggling out.

 In spite of contests, the presidential election has usually been a non-abrasive affair. The negotiations among the different parties are more or less concluded before the candidature is announced, as befits the dignity of the chair of the head of state. This appearance accords smoothly with the convention of cooperating with the dominant national party of the moment regarding choice of president. The peaceable tradition is occasionally disrupted, for example when the presidential election becomes the arena for a tussle for power within the dominant party itself. This was the case when V.V. Giri was installed instead of Neelam Sanjiva Reddy to establish Indira Gandhis supremacy over the old guard in the Congress. This years presidential campaign was unusually acrimonious too. But the political scene has changed strikingly since the days of Indira Gandhi. There are dominant formations and powerful orbiting parties that may or may not tie up with the dominant formations at a given point of time. Regional interests and identity or caste politics have given rise to multi-layered divisions that are reflected in every power struggle, disguised or blatant. Cross-voting in Gujarat, for instance, seems to have had more to do with rebellion against the chief minister, Narendra Modi, than with the choice of president. That the Shiv Sena backed Ms Patil in Maharashtra, again, is more of a message to its close ally, the BJP, and to Mr Shekhawat than a politically correct desire for a woman president. There has been cross-voting in Chhattisgarh too, which is being considered a small message for a troubled chief minister there. In Tamil Nadu, a number of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam legislators went and voted, when the informal decision of the party had been to abstain.

 For once, then, the tensions did not have to do with gender. While it may be politically correct to have a woman president at last, the realities of state politics are perhaps the most effective unsexing agent. Lady Macbeth would have had to look no further.

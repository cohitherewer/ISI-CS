 SLOW MELODIC 

 ELABORATION 

 Nilaksha Gupta

 Music

 Rashid Khan, the renowned khayal 

 singer, was featured in a recital titled Malhar ke Rang 

 by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations in collaboration 

 with the department of information and cultural affairs, 

 West Bengal, and Anamika Kala Sangam at Rabindra Sadan on 

 July 27.

 The Malhar Rashid chose for the 

 evening was Megh Malhar. The vilambit ektal khayal 

 in the raga opened with phrase development in the 

 upper mandra saptak with downward swoops to the deep 

 bass. Rashid, however, did not go in for slow elaboration 

 in the lower mandra saptak.

 The version of Megh Malhar presented 

 by Rashid Khan was the one with the komal gandhar 

 and preferred by the Gwalior and Agra khayal gharanas. 

 The komal gandhar comes in through the phrase re ga ma 

 re sa at the end of cycles of melodic elaboration. The 

 gandhar, sung with a short vibrato from the 

 madhyam (called andolan) is presented only 

 through this single phrase, which is used sparingly. Rashid 

 Khan observed this rule except on one occasion in which 

 the gandhar came in through the phrase re pa ga, 

 as in Mian ki Malhar. However, even here, the komal gandhar 

 had the Megh intonation or andolan and not the Mian Malhar 

 one, which is more expansive. This happened around the 19th 

 minute of the vilambit khayal.

 The melodic elaboration between 

 the sadaj and pancham of the madhya saptak 

 was of shorter duration but very much in the class of the 

 earlier portion. The tar saptak sadaj or high tonic 

 was struck on the 23rd minute of the vilambit and 

 a medium-pace sargam taan heralded the first line 

 of the antara. After this, there were cascades of 

 sargam taans descending from the high tonic. Then the antara 

 was fittingly completed without more decoration. There were 

 excellent fast-medium sargam taans and faster aakar taans 

 in the last five minutes of the vilambit.

 Then came the classic Niyamat 

 Khan sadra (jhaptal composition) garajay 

 ghata ghana, with short, rhythmic, accentuated sargam 

 taans to the mukhra in the first half and aakar taans 

 from taar sadaj after the antara. There was good 

 taankari in the drut teental khayal as well. 

 The taans were not unduly long and always to the 

 context. Many of them bore the stamp of Rashids guru, Nissar 

 Hussain Khan.

 Rashid Khan went on to sing a 

 drut teental khayal in raga Sohini, featuring fine short 

 rhythmic sargam patterns and excellent taankari, 

 some again bearing the stamp of his guru. Then there 

 was an equally well-sung tarana in the same raga 

 and finally a Punjab-style light classical composition. 

 Sanjay Mukherjee and Jyoti Goho provided expert tabla 

 and harmonium accompaniment respectively throughout the 

 recital.

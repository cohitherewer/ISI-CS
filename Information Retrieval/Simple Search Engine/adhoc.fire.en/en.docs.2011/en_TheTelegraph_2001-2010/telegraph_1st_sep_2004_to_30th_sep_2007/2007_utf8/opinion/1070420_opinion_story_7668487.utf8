 THE RULE OF THE BROWN SAHIB 

 BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh

 We have become a country of extremes. Extreme actions, extreme reactions, extreme positions and general hysteria. With a burgeoning middle class and the opening up of the economy, the government is beginning to feel insecure and irrelevant in some areas. Rather than changing the archaic, colonial laws that India inherited, our rulers and their government servants have accelerated their intrusion in the lives of an energetic, vibrant people. 

 The system first encourages new enterprises and then comes down heavily on any successful venture, compelling the people to revert to the dishonest methods of functioning that were in operation earlier. Anywhere else, opening up an economy brings in comparative transparency forced by competition. 

 Successive governments in India have said one thing and done another. A decade ago, international business hesitated to set up shop in India because of the horrendous procedures, laced with demands of illegal money, which had to be complied with. Much creative energy and working time were spent on dealing with a clumsy and sulking government, which felt that its hand was being restrained. It retaliated by being cussed and non- cooperative. It made the peoples lives miserable. It encouraged those who functioned outside the rules of governance. This led to the creation of an evil nexus between politicians, businessmen and the State, leading to the creation of a triumvirate. 

 Three is company

 The nexus continues to rule. The contrary positions of government policy continue to plague India. Those who grow economically are damned and money made legitimately by entrepreneurs is also insulted. White money placed in banks is abused as it grows in quantum but black money is able to run amok. Luxury brands are encouraged to come into the market; cabinet ministers hail their entry and talk of the growth of the consumer, but the tax man questions you when you spend more than Rs 25,000 using your credit card. 

 The government frees certain sectors and as they become buoyant, the predictable raid raj ensues. Quick money is extracted and instead of transparency, new and innovative ideas emerge to beat the law while leaders and policy makers turn a blind eye. Artists get raided because prices have soared internationally and the government wants to intervene in this lucrative sector. But the builders and land mafias are left alone, as are government employees who indulge in illegal transactions. An eight-hundred crore business is put under the scanner while a 2,000-crore one is allowed to run free.

 Every Indian, whether hailing from our cities or villages, knows about the frightful levels of corruption in the country. No one is fooled by rhetoric. Indians choose to find ways out rather than be confrontational. This is fine with the administration you keep me happy and I shall do the same. This government hails the middle class, selfishly uses its vitality and then kicks on its shins. Contradictions abound and confusion surrounding the right and the wrong gets accentuated. Anarchy prevails and rapidly grows due to failed governance and an unchanged mindset of the ruling class. 

 However, when the fine and fragile line of patience is crossed, all hell will break loose. The honest, who are hounded today for being clean and upright, for standing by their ethics and values even while being threatened with corruption, malpractice, exploitation and harassment, will win in the near future. Indias trial by fire is yet to come. It will overwhelm the ruling class much like the freedom movement did. They were white, these are brown!

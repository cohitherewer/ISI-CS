The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AFTER ALL, EVERYTHING HAS TO COME DOWN ONE DAY

 There is a corner shop inside a narrow lane near the Jagat Theatre in central Calcutta. New Varieties Stores, which sells everything from soaps to cheap transistor sets, is situated in the basement of a crumbling, grey mansion that looks at least 70 years old. The man at the counter has no time to dwell on ironies though. Or on the danger that the dilapidated building poses. He appears a touch philosophical about it all. Everything has to come down one day, he says, when I mention the news of an old building on Strand Road collapsing and killing a man. He seems content to sit on his stool, newspaper in hand, and wait for a customer. A serpentine crack runs across the low roof, splitting it into two halves. The green paint has come off the walls, leaving ugly, bare patches. The air inside is damp. Even the jars of lozenges look timeless.

 The municipality, he says, had twice asked him to vacate and move to a new, safer place. He has decided to stay put. So have the other tenants and shopowners who share his fatal inertia. The next time, the officials have threatened to issue a notice, declaring the premises dangerous. But the men and women remain unperturbed. Let them do what they like. Im not afraid of the sky falling on my head, he says, before turning to greet a customer.

 The simple act of going down the stairs of a Metro station can be laced with dangers. You could miss the uneven edges of the steps, lying in permanent disrepair. Or slip over the trail of water (another enduring feature of the stairs) during rush hour. For the aged, infirm or disabled, these are enough reasons not to risk a metro ride. The station premises present a lethal reconciliation of opposites, of electric wires and seeping water. There is only a semblance of air-conditioning, so people are left to the mercy of pedestal fans. The train floors get heated up alarmingly, there are occasional spells of darkness, and doors open and close without warning, not to mention the heady smell of Indian cooking that wafts in as one enters the platform.

 Like human life, human dignity, too, is tried and tested in bizarre ways. On an unforgettable ride from Chandni Chowk to Tollygunge, I witnessed a little girls rising desperation to use the loo. Her mother tried to ignore her plangent appeals till Kalighat, after which, as the poor child became unmanageable, a space had to be cleared for her to relieve herself. People clucked their tongues in disgust, some in sympathy, while others moved quietly away. But nobody seemed to mind the absence of public toilets on the station premises very much.

 There were multiple revelations in store for me on the journey to Sealdah. Stuck in the early-morning traffic for close to an hour on the stretch of A.J.C. Bose Road that houses two schools St. James and Pratt Memorial I realized that office-goers were a saner lot than school-goers. The former understood impending dangers better. One may argue that this is because they are adults and the school-goers are not. But that is precisely the point. Children are not supposed to know how dangerous it is to ride, half-asleep and without a helmet, on the pillion of a scooty. They would know even less of the risks of squeezing in through the small gap of the road divider when the traffic is in full flow on both sides of the road in order to take the shortest route to the school gate. Their parents know, of course, and so does the school. Which is why parents or carpool-drivers raise their hands and voices for the bus-drivers to notice. And the school deploys older students, yellow armbands in place, to do something that even the most experienced traffic sergeant would find difficult. But I wondered, while looking in disbelief at all this, whether flailing arms and shouts were enough to ensure safe passage for the children and guardians amidst vehicles trying to work through the bottleneck at top speed. Go slow, school ahead. Nothing of the sort here.

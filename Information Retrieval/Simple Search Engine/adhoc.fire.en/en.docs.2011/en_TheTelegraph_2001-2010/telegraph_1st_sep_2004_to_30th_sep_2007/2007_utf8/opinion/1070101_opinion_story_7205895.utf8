 HANGING FIRE

 The hanging of Saddam Hussein is the last chapter of a chronicle foretold. The day the former tyrant of Iraq was picked out from his hideout, it was clear that Saddam Husseins days were numbered. To many it would seem that the dictator has got his just desert because he, in his time as a ruler, killed mercilessly and mindlessly. There will be few mourners for Saddam Hussein among the Shias and Kurds in Iraq. Yet the civilized world cannot govern itself by Saddam Husseins own bloodthirsty standards. He did face a trial, was duly found guilty and condemned to be hanged by a court of law constituted by the government that rules in Iraq. The conduct of that government, without any doubt, is influenced by the United States of America, but it is also true that this is an elected government and thus represents the will of the people of Iraq. It is easy to write off the execution of Saddam Hussein as victors justice and to cast him as a victim. By the same yardstick, the Nuremberg Trials and the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal should also be dismissed. What is important to remember is that Saddam Hussein faced some kind of trial where he was allowed to present his case. His victims were never given a hearing. Bleeding heart radicals should be told that tyranny knows no law save the whims of the tyrant.

 What is significant is that apart from the space in the media, the hanging has not had any major political repercussions. Even in the Islamic world, the outcry has been muted. This probably suggests that the execution, because it was expected, had become irrelevant. The irrelevance was also related to the fact of the symbolic element involved in Saddam Husseins execution. The hanging was intended to signal the passing of an era, a particularly horrible one in the history of Iraq. The intentions of the signal may actually represent an optimism that is profoundly misplaced. The era horribilis will end in Iraq when terror and violence end there, when the people have enough to eat and when they can return to their normal lives. Saddam Husseins regime had disrupted the normalcy. The intervention of the US and its aftermath have not yet brought back normalcy to the land of the Tigris and the Euphrates. The cessation of violence and the restoration of normalcy are still a long way away. When it happens the curtain will finally come down on the era of violence that Saddam Hussein had inaugurated.

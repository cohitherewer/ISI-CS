The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SO LITTLE TO CHOOSE FROM

 THIS ABOVE ALL- KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Poll frenzy

 In a few days, three states will go to the polls. Of the three, the outcome in Punjab may indicate what the people think about the performance of the Sonia Gandhi-Manmohan Singh government at the Centre. It is a border state which reacts sharply to changes in Indo-Pak equations. It has seen three wars fought in its territory. It has Indias third largest religious minority, the Sikhs, in minority. The outcome will indicate whether or not the Central government policies are, or are not, even-handed in their treatment of other minorities, the Muslims and Christians. It remains the most advanced and the richest agriculturist state of the Union. The results will indicate whether or not its farmers are, or are not, satisfied with what the state government is doing for them. Other issues, like the future of Chandigarh and the distribution of river waters, will be shelved for the time being. The demand for Khalistan is dead. So is the militant activity perpetrated in its name. Relations with Pakistan have never been better. The Sikhs have never had it so good as they have it today. The credit for these achievements goes to the Congress.

 The main contenders for power are the same as before: one one side is the Congress, led by Captain Amarinder Singh, the erstwhile Maharaja of Patiala, on the other is the Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party combine, led by Parkash Singh Badal, the head of Punjabs wealthiest family, owning vast tracts of farmlands and real estate. Amarinder Singh has the states resources behind him. Badal controls the mini-empire of Sikh temples managed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee and thousands of schools, colleges and hospitals run by it. From what one can gauge from full-page advertisements in Punjab papers by both adversaries, money will be no problem for either party: it will flow like the waters of the Sutlej and the Beas. So will desi sharab. Punjab retains its position as the number one state in the consumption of liquor and drugs.

 So far only the names of candidates have been announced. They follow the old feudal pattern: sons, sons-in-law, nephews and other relations come first, next come caste affiliations: Jats, Khatris, Mazhabis (Dalit) for reserved seats. In large cities like Ludhiana, Amritsar and Jalandhar, they are from the rich creamy layer. Elections need money; they have it. Starry-eyed youngsters, who dream of modernizing India by ridding it of its pseudo-religious clap-trap do not appear in the lists of aspirants. For them, no matter who wins or loses, it will be as the French put it: plus a change, plus cest la mme chose the more it changes, the more it remains the same thing.

 Few words but many verses

 What Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore is to the Bengalis, Bhai Vir Singh (1812-1956) is to Punjabi litterateurs and a cult figure of Sikh orthodoxy. The slightest criticism of his writings may invite the wrath of the Khalsa Panth on your head. He was himself a strong upholder of Khalsa traditions. 

 I recall staying a night on my way to Lahore in his spacious bungalow in Amritsar where he spent most of his life and died. It is now a museum. There are Bhai Vir Singh Sadans in major cities of Punjab and one in New Delhi. He always had a lot of admirers hanging around, but made his appearance only at mealtimes to acknowledge their greetings. 

 He was a man of very few words. I and my newly-married wife happened to be at the breakfast table. Out of the blue, Bhai Sahib blurted out, Anyone who has eaten kuttha (non-kosher meat forbidden to Sikhs) should leave my table to once. I could sense the remark was aimed at both of us. We have been living abroad during our student days and were known for our unorthodox views. Neither of us budged from our seats. We finished our breakfast and took his leave to continue our journey to Lahore. It must have been around 1939.

 I kept reading Vir Singhs writings and was quite impressed by some of his short poems. He wrote an enormous amount of blank verse and a few novels as well. I have included three of his short poems in an anthology of my favourite quotations to be published later this year. 

 I quote one:

 Patthar naal reoh la baithee

 Na hassey, na boley;

 Sohna laggey, man noo mohey

 Ghundee dilon na kholey.

 Chhadiaan chhaddia jaanda

 naahin

 Milliyaan niggh na kaayee

 Hacchha jiven raza hai teyre

 Nazaron ho na ohleyS

 (I fell in love with one made of stone/ He would not laugh, he would not speak/ He is handsome to behold/ But his heart he will not unfold/ I wish I could give him up but failed to do so/ Meeting him gave no warmth, he was cold/ So, be it, do what you think is right / Only forever remain within my sight.)

 Sorry tale of two friends

 Sidhu and Sandhu

 Were two bandhu

 In the Patiala road rage case;

 The Punjab High Court

 Breached the fort

 By exposing their guilty face.

 Sindhu and Sandhu

 The two bandhu

 Will depend on SC appeals,

 But for the nonce

 They must renounce

 The Lok Sabha and TV deals.

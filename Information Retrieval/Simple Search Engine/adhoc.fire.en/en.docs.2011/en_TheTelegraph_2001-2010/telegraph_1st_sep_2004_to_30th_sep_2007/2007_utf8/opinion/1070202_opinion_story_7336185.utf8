 SEAT SHARING

 Maharashtras urban development authorities have taken the wind out of the sails of the major contending parties in the corporation elections. Their decision to have six out of the 10 mayoral seats reserved for women could not have particularly enthused the warring men in the 1,162 wards undergoing the polls. The civic polls are supposed to provide them with the blueprint for action in the coming rounds of elections to rural local bodies and, eventually, the state and general elections. The crumbs of political power made available to aspirants would determine loyalties, alliances and other future arrangements. Keeping the crucial posts reserved for women, and that too of specific castes and classes, would mightily inconvenience political parties, most of which have made no special effort to increase womens participation in their ranks. 

 There is no reason the urban development department should be blamed for their despair. The 33 per cent reservation for women in panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies is constitutionally guaranteed. The Maharashtra administration is merely implementing an established rule. But, as elsewhere, the strict enforcement of the provision could bring to the fore stooges who would merely carry out the dictates of their respective parties. This is unfortunate, for womens effectiveness in achieving community welfare and pushing through development, particularly at the local level, is an empirically-proven fact. However, without commitment, on the part of the women elected to positions of importance and that of the political organizations they represent, faithfulness to policy alone will not make a difference.

 BOOKS AND BYTES TOGETHER 

 Bookwise

 Still in with a 

 chance 

 Advanced computer hardware and 

 high-speed broadband internet connections are now an integral 

 part of the book world. Every reference library is equipped 

 with them; every writer with a computer has broadband connectivity 

 to keep in touch with the literary world. These devices 

 now cost less and newspapers and magazines are becoming 

 redundant in their existing forms. Hence, the question that 

 is being asked is whether books and other print material 

 will be replaced by bytes in the future.

 Bill Gates certainly thinks so. 

 Superfast internet connections are already there and Google 

 has begun to post out-of-copyright books on the Net. While 

 reliable sales figures of college-level textbooks are not 

 available, publishers complain that students are already 

 spending less, probably because of rampant photocopying 

 and easy availability of material on the internet. But screen 

 reading is unlikely to replace printed copies soon for three 

 reasons. 

 Copyright permission is the first 

 big hurdle. Publishers make their money from print material, 

 which could be in the form of a book or an article in a 

 magazine. These have been acquired, produced and marketed 

 by them at some cost. Surrendering copyrights and putting 

 them in the public domain, as it happens with out-of-copyright 

 matter, would put publishers out of business.

 As a result, publishers hang on 

 to their rights till the term expires, which is 50 years 

 after the authors death. And, even in such cases, the estate 

 or the successors of the author will renew the copyright 

 simply by updating the text in case of educational books, 

 or by providing a new introduction to fiction. Copyright 

 is messy but the point here is that publishers will never 

 let go of their copyright. All they would do and this 

 is already happening is post a summary of the book, with 

 critical comments, and then seduce the reader to buy the 

 printed stuff. It is rather like the postings of synopses 

 of articles in up-market journals; to read the complete 

 article, you need to subscribe to the journal or pay for 

 the printout of the article. Nothing comes for free.

 Second, is screen reading. Not 

 many in their thirties or over have gotten used to it. It 

 requires a different bent of mind, which comes when you 

 are young and pliable.

 Marketing of bytes, especially 

 for the Indian market, is probably the most difficult task, 

 at least in India. How do you demonstrate the software? 

 It is not exactly the same as selling CDs and tapes. The 

 middle class is not ready to buy a product without a proper 

 demonstration and a chance to figure it out themselves. 

 And, even if you have worked out a solution, it is still 

 beyond the reach of many consumers. It is true that the 

 internet has become an indispensable tool for learning and 

 reference. Its importance will increase in the future. But 

 whether it will completely replace printed stuff is another 

 matter.

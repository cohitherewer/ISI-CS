 FLYING TOO LOW

 MALVIKA SINGH

 There was a time when Air India represented the best of India. It was a generous and gracious airline. It had hospitality at the core of its management and efficiency was a given. J.R.D. Tata, along with Nari Dastur and a whole host of sophisticated, culturally sensitive and competent executives, led a great crew which was proud to be Indian. Bobby Kooka created the most memorable advertising campaigns, which were, in their day, streets ahead of international campaigns of other national airlines. Alas, like most things, as the world moved on and embraced change, we in India stood still in a quagmire, allowing ourselves to be pulled into a bottomless pit. We lost out.

 With the takeover by the public sector, and the babu calling the shots comfortable in the knowledge that he will be neither accountable nor vulnerable for his failure to compete internationally, and therefore, without pride or commitment Air India deteriorated from an A-grade carrier to a smelly, badly-maintained operation. It had a silver lining though an ever-smiling, first-rate crew, which has serviced this company with loyal commitment despite management betrayal. The crew needs to be saluted and rewarded with a rapid restructuring before it is too late.

 With new routes and additions to its fleet, the corporation seems wanting to revive the entity and make it fly. The million dollar question is will it get it right? From the design of the inner cabin, the upholstery, the loos, the toiletries, the uniform of the crew, the magazines offered, the crockery, cutlery, drinks and meals to ground-handling, special deals for full fare-paying passengers to the management it all needs a radical overhaul. 

 Incredible India

 For a start, all those commuting free at the behest of the government must travel at the rear of the plane. This is a prerequisite without which Air India will never be an international airline. Thereafter, the management has to be purged of its cocky take-it-or-leave-it attitude and mindset. It has to be accountable to those it serves the paying passenger and not the other way around. The lowest-tender syndrome, that has destroyed quality in India, must be discarded for the best both in quality and style, without personal biases or the dispensation of favours by the powers that be.

 Air India should not be synonymous with all that is sub-standard. Indias reputation and dignity, and that of a new, competitive generation, are at stake. Pride is an essential component for any true change, reform and growth. We have to deliberately and voluntarily bury the baggage we have been forced to carry so far. It has been detrimental and destructive. It has condoned indiscipline, ineptitude and inefficiency, endorsed corruption, improprieties, nepotism and dishonesty. 

 The government and its babus need to step aside and welcome those who know and understand the needs of a competitive service industry to take over the reins. Quality, style, an expertise in hospitality, compatible with established international norms, are bare necessities. Beyond that, Air India has to add value, special Indian value. 

 The creative and intellectual strength that is sitting in diverse parts of this country can be drawn not from members of the Indian administrative service, but from all those professionals who have dedicated their lives to their disciplines, who have been out there competing in the big bad world, who have earned accolades and won laurels, having fought all the odds entrepreneurs are compelled to face in this country. The bureaucrats should stick to their mandate and re-invent themselves to administer a new India with dignity and integrity.

 Air India could well become the mascot of Incredible India!

 Native wisdom

 Sir It is heartening to see that porters are being encouraged to try their hand at electoral politics (From platform to heartland poll turf, March 27). But there seems to be more in Ram Vilas Paswans patronage of Amiruddin, the coolie from Varanasi, than the welfare of the porters lot. The Lok Janashakti Party chief is probably only hoping that the support from Amiruddins colleagues and the downtrodden classes will win him a seat that is not the LJPs stronghold. But will the porters of Varanasi station get a more secure life even after that? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Avinash Gupta, Bandel

 In trouble, again

 Troubled times

Sir The SMS that Greg Chappell sent to a sports journalist makes it clear that the Indian coach was unhappy with the squad that was selected for the World Cup (SMS sludge flies in Greg fight, March 28). However, the coach had no business complaining that he had not been given a team of his choice. For the past one and a half year, Chappell had the liberty to pick players of his choice. His youth policy saw a number of young players being tried out in the national team. Only when the youngsters failed to deliver did the selectors opt for experienced players. After all, success in cricket is not guaranteed by young players, but by players who perform on the pitch. 

 The Board of Control for Cricket in India should not view Chappells criticism of the senior players and the chairman of the selection committee lightly. This kind of statement on the part of the coach sends wrong signals and is likely to damage team spirit. The latest controversy surrounding the coach has also shown that matters related to team selection do not remain confidential in India. Chappells message was not intended for public viewing. It seems that the journalist who leaked the SMS was only interested in creating another needless controversy.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir Greg Chappell was a cricketer of considerable repute. During his stint as the Indian coach, he has devoted all his time and energy to improve the standard of the game in India. Unfortunately, Chappell has often found himself in the middle of controversies. Things took a turn for the worse after Dilip Vengsarkar was appointed as the chairman of the selection committee. Chappell could not pick the team that was to his liking, probably because the chief selector joined hands with the senior players to deny young players a place in the team. The board should not only extend Chappells tenure but also give him a free hand in matters of selection. This would give him an opportunity to build a formidable team for the future. Perhaps it would also be a good idea if the board dispenses with the services of Vengsarkar and his fellow selectors with immediate effect.

 Yours faithfully 

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir Greg Chappell is certainly one of the greatest batsmen of all times. But Chappell as a person is not above fault. One of his biggest drawbacks is his inability to accept criticism. He prefers to pass on the blame to others. Earlier, Chappell had leaked an e-mail accusing the former captain, Sourav Ganguly, of creating divisions in the team. Now, Rahul Dravid, the present captain, and the chairman of selectors are under fire. The coach has blamed these two men for the teams debacle in the World Cup. What is shocking to note is that Chappell has not had the courage to accept defeat in a graceful manner. Neither has he shown an inclination to assess what went wrong during the tournament. The board should demand an explanation from him for his behaviour. He has already been a disaster for Indian cricket. He should not be allowed to bring it into further disrepute.

 Yours faithfully,

Biranchi Narayan Acharya, Cuttack

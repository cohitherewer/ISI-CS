 Letters to Editor

 Thirty years of misrule

 Sir Having retired recently, I decided to spend the time on my hands by helping a few boys and girls studying in Class X in government-aided schools with their English. I was appalled to discover that most of these students cannot even spell West Bengal correctly. As the leaders of the Left Front government in West Bengal congratulate themselves on having ruled uncontested for thirty long years, they should be reminded of the lack they have created. Thanks to the education policy followed by the Left, the future of thousands studying in the state has been crippled.

 Yours faithfully,

 Biren Mukerjee, Howrah

 Dimmed brightness

 Under siege

Sir The mysterious death of the full-grown Royal Bengal tiger continues to baffle all (Tiger dead near tracks, June 19). The death is unfortunate, given the dwindling number of tigers in the country. It is even sadder that the officials of the forest department and the railways are squabbling meaninglessly over the death, with each side eager to pass the responsibility on to the other. Steps have rarely been taken either to stop poaching or to prevent trains from mowing down animals. Far from acknowledging the lapses, the authorities are trying their best to cover them up. 

 It is possible that the tiger had been killed by a speeding train since elephants and leopards frequently meet their end in this way. If death has resulted from collision with a speeding train, then the railways authorities should immediately consider the diversification of the track. A routine probe, as directed by the Bengal forest minister, Ananta Roy, into why tigers are straying out of their areas, will only be a drain on taxpayers money. The only party to benefit will be the investigating officials, who will get to tour the forests for free. 

 Ever-increasing human population has forced animals to lead a marginalized life in the fast-depleting forest areas. The recently passed tribal bill, which gives the tribal population the right to use forest land to their advantage, has been another blow to the habitat of wild animals. Politicians, eager to please only those who will vote for them, do not bother themselves with creatures who have no voter-identity cards to brandish. It is time that all members of parliament voiced their protest against the indiscriminate slaughter and poaching of wild animals. They might pass a law that would give the life term for any unauthorized encroachment on forests. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The photograph of the dead tiger of North Bengal shows almost no sign of injury on the carcass. This suggests that the tiger could not have been a victim of a train accident. It was probably poisoned. It is possible that age or injury had compelled the tiger to become a cattle-lifter, with the result that it was poisoned to death by villagers and then left near the railway tracks to suggest an accident. A post-mortem should be conducted immediately. Else, railways and forest officials will soon cover up the inopportune death.

 Yours faithfully,

Joydip Kundu, Calcutta

 Sir That a dead tiger was discovered near the railway tracks off a North Bengal village, where the animal is rarely found, points neither to illegal poaching nor to running trains. It only underlines the truth that animals are fast being hounded off their land by encroaching humans. The railway tracks have been in existence in the Dooars for a very long time. But only recently have there been cases of animals being hit by trains. Even animals like the tiger, which live deep inside the forest, are forced to come out when human beings intrude on their habitat. Human populations on the periphery of forest-lands must be relocated fast. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Brahmo, Calcutta

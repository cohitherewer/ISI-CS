 When love and hate collide

 Sir Celebrating Valentines Day is certainly a risky proposition in some parts of India, what with the Shiv Sena lurking in the shadows. One cannot ever recall the Sainiks having done anything constructive. I understand that they are not happy with evil western concepts such as Valentines day. However, the Shiv Sena needs to understand that a democracy is all about respecting different points of view. And even if one needs to protest against something, one can do so peacefully, and not by engaging in acts of violence and arson. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mrinal Sinha, Dhanbad

 Second chance

 Sir It has been reported in sections of the media that Amar Singh and Chandrababu Naidu have proposed the name of Amitabh Bachchan as the next president of India. There is no doubt about the fact that Bachchan fulfils all the criteria required to succeed A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to the post of president. For instance, Bachchan is an Indian citizen, is over 35 years of age (a person cannot be less than 35 in order to become the president ) and is an immensely popular figure both among the young and the old in the country. 

 Despite all this, I think that Kalam, the present president, should continue for another full term. There are two very good reasons to argue along these lines. First, after spending five years in the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Kalam has acquired a fair idea about the roles and responsibilities of the president of this country. An experienced candidate is certainly a better option than a man who has no idea about what is expected of him. Second, and more important, a second term will give Kalam more time to decide on the mercy petition of Afzal Guru. This is a serious matter and Kalam should be given more time to arrive at a judicious decision. A new man on the job, whether it is Bachchan or someone else, might find it difficult to deal with a matter so complex.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir In our country, politicians always try and get their own candidate to become the president. This is because a yes man in the countrys highest office makes things easier for them. 

 It is doubtful whether politicians will give A.P.J. Abdul Kalam the nod to become the president for yet another term. A selfless and unbiased person like him could never be a popular choice for our politicians. Kalam has never allowed his post to be treated as a rubber-stamp by our netas. On the contrary, during his term in office, Kalam, in his capacity as the president, tried his best to prevent people in power from committing wrong. Whatever the president has done has been in the interest of the country and its people. 

 It is imperative that all right-minded individuals united in their demand for nominating Kalam as the president for another five years. They would not have any cause to rue their decision. Kalam is a secular person who is greatly admired for his wisdom as well as his compassion.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Delhi

 Sir Amitabh Bachchan may not be the ideal candidate for the head of state. After all, a man who has no qualms about attending religious ceremonies to rid a manglik woman of her dreaded curse cannot be a role model for the citizens of this country. 

 What is more, the decision to appoint the superstar as the president of the country is not going to go down well with his fans. They would like to see their hero on the silver screen, rather than watch him address the nation on the eve of Republic Day celebrations.

 Yours faithfully,

Angana Nair, Calcutta

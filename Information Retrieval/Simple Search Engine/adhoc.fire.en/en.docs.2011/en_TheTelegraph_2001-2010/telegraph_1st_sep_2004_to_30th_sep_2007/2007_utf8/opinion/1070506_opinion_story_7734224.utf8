 Letters to Editor

 Take a nap on match day

 Sir This is certainly not a case of sour grapes. But it must be said that Indias early exit from the World Cup robbed the tournament of colour and excitement. The cricketing world yawned through the matches, most of which were one-sided affairs. Even the final was a damp squib, with a delayed start, the curtailing of overs and a farcical end in darkness. Perhaps, the ICC needs to shorten future editions of the Cup. Otherwise, fans would continue to complain of boredom, even if the Aussies got beaten in a final by accident. 

 Yours faithfully,

 J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Easy way out

 Sir The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, is seeking re-election for the Rajya Sabha in order to remain in office for a full term (A safe house beckons Manmohan, May 1). Singhs endeavour to get re-elected from Guwahati in the capacity of tenancy does not infringe on constitutional rights. But such a step does hint at the possibility that the party leadership is not confident of fielding Singh as a Lok Sabha candidate. 

 Singh should definitely think of contesting the polls anywhere in India. As an eminent economist with a squeaky clean image, he will sail through to the Lok Sabha. This will not only add to his political clout but also help scuttle accusations that the prime minister is not a peoples representative. It would also dispel doubts that Singh is under the thumb of the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The editorial, Sad reflection (May 3), is right in saying that the prime minister is setting a bad precedent by seeking to get re-elected to the Rajya Sabha. It is ironical that a man of Singhs integrity has courted unnecessary controversies that have sullied his image. Moreover, Singh also has a few dubious firsts to his credit. He is the only prime minister in India to have been selected for the post after a woman politician set aside her deserved claim to the chair, sighting her inner voice. He may also go on to become the only prime minister to complete a full-term without being a member of the Lok Sabha. Singh should definitely reconsider his decision to continue in the upper house. After all, Indian citizens would like to see Singh getting elected to the Lok Sabha. Moreover, a win in a Lok Sabha seat would also inject a sense of confidence in Singh, thereby helping him handle tricky situations in a better manner.

 Yours faithfully,

Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir Indian politicians can take lessons from Bangladeshs Nobel peace prize winner, Mohammed Yunus (Poverty easier than politics, May 3). In recent years, Bangladesh has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. The nation has been almost reduced to a state of anarchy. Corruption and the criminalization of politics have also dented the reputation of this country. There has also been a shift towards dynastic politics, and two prominent women leaders have been largely responsible for reducing the countrys economy to a shambles. 

 In a situation such as this, Yunuss decision to plunge into Bangladeshs murky political waters would have been disastrous. In any case, he would have soon found himself playing second fiddle to his wily rivals. It is heartening to note that good sense has prevailed at last and the Nobel laureate has decided to stay clear of politics. This would save Yunus from being disillusioned, which would have been inevitable had he decided to become a politician.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

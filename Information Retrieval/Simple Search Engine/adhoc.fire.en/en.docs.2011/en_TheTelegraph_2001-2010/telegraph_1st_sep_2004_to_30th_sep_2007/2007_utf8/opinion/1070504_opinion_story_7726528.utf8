 After the storm

 ANDAMAN amp; NICOBAR: THE MYSTERIOUS BAY ISLANDS OF INDIA, PRE AND POST TSUNAMI (Rebati Raman Bera, Rs 1200) is a collection of photographs, with densely informative texts, taken and compiled by Tilak Ranjan Bera. Bera, an ophthalmologist deeply interested in nature and wildlife, has detailed knowledge of the 572 beautiful islands that make up this twin archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. His survey is historical and anthropological, covering the aboriginal peoples who inhabit the islands with varying degrees of contact with the post-Stone-Age world. Top left is a post-tsunami view of the Car Nicobar island, the southern end of which has now been engulfed by the ocean. Bottom left are the Onges, an aboriginal Negrito tribe living on the Little Andaman Island. On the right can be seen some of the 696 cells for solitary confinement at the British Cellular Jail atop the hillock on Atlanta Point, Port Blair.

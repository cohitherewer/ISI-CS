 COMPETITION IS A FOUL WORD

 POETIC JUSTICE

 Like her father, Kanimozhi is on her way to giving up poetry to join politics

 What is it with Tamil political leaders and literary or, to extend it a little bit, cultural ambitions? Alright, the Tamils love their poets and filmstars, but why is it that all netas worth their unpronouncable names have shining literary-cultural pasts behind them? A bright new star has erupted on Tamil Nadus political horizon, and what else could she be but a poet? 

 Kanimozhi, who is lucky enough to have her political career started off with a Rajya Sabha stint, is the daughter of the chief minister. The fact that she stayed more or less away from politics for 39 years of her life is a minor miracle, no doubt. But then, she was born when the World Tamil Conference was taking place in Madurai in 1968. Her father, M. Karunanidhi, who was then the state PWD minister in Annadurais first DMK ministry, was on the dais when he received a telegram saying that his younger wife, Rajathi Ammal, had given birth to a daughter. A stroke of providence, no less, and the father named his newborn girl Kanimozhi (language that is pleasing to the ears). Unwitting or otherwise, Tamil literature and poetry had already become a part of her life.

 Now Karunanidhi himself was one of the leading lights of the Tamil literary world (of the popular kind, since he wrote mainly screenplays for films). His entry into active politics is still regarded by many Tamilians as a great loss to Tamil literature. (Will posterity say the same about Mamata Banerjee?) In spite of a convent education she studied in the same school as one J. Jayalalithaa and degree in economics, his best-loved daughter (he has another, called Selvi, from his elder wife, Dayalu Ammal) did not disappoint him: she turned to writing poetry, and soon became one of the most prominent young poets in Tamil. Karunanidhi has recently claimed in public that Kanimozhi is his literary heir. From what one reads about her astute moves during the recent crisis in the party, one can safely say that she is well on her way to becoming his political heir as well. (Oh dear, will another newspaper office be burnt then? And what will her half-brothers think of being beaten to the post because of poetry?) 

 Kanimozhi, however, cannot be blamed. She does not know whether poetry chose me as a vehicle or it is the other way. Perhaps guessing that there may be questions about edging past M.K. Stalin and M. Azhagiri, her half-brothers who have been in politics for decades now, she has already put her thoughts in a poem. Potti [competition] is one Tamil word I still fail to comprehend, she mused in the poem, asking, Who is whose competitor in this wide street called Earth? It is not known what Stalin and Azhagiri think of their half-sisters poem.

 If this rings a bell here and there, here is an excerpt from her fathers poem, written just after the acrimonious battle with the Maran brothers:

 Throgathaal ennai thulaithu chendra thozhargal silarum/ Thol meethu kai potu thunaikku vanthu vittom enbathum kanavuthaney;/ Palikkaatha kanavugalaal manam valikkaathu;/ Jolikkaathu koozhangkarkal kuppaikkey pogum;/ Pattai theeti paarthalum payanillai.

 (Some friends who pierced me through betrayal;/ Wasnt it a dream, people putting their hands on my shoulders to support me;/ Unfulfilled dreams dont hurt the mind;/ Stones that dont shine are thrown away as worthless;/ It is useless even to polish it.)

 Not quite John Dryden or Alexander Pope, but the DMK supporters are not complaining.

 Kanimozhi is a feminist too. And this is not merely because the first anthology of her poems was called Karuvarai Vaasanai (Smells of the Womb). When the filmstar, Khushboo, faced the ire of the Tamil moral police for saying that pre-marital sex is only normal, Kanimozhi firmly took the heroines side. She wasnt into politics then, but it would not be fair to speculate what she would have done, given the same circumstances, today.

 She was also not in politics when, along with the Karthik Chidambaram, the son of the Union finance minister, P. Chidambaram, she floated a freebooters forum called Karuthu. This forum was formed to give people the space to say what they feel is right even if society finds it unacceptable. 

 Now that Kanimozhi has been formally inducted into politics, how will Tamil poetry cope with the loss? And what will happen to all her existential angst?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Let there be light

 Sir When all of Bengal is suffering from terrible power-cuts, why isnt anyone thinking about daylight-saving time? The eastern region should have a different time zone from western India, where the sun rises at least an hour behind the east. This will ease power consumption both in homes and offices as well as by the street lights. When dusk falls in Calcutta around 6 pm, Mumbai and Bangalore still enjoy bright sunshine. The east needs to start its day a little earlier than the west, but try explaining that to the people in power!

 Yours faithfully,

 Swati Das, 

 Calcutta

 Only words

 Sir It was extremely irresponsible of Indias ambassador to the United States of America, Ronen Sen, to mock at the political establishment and rebuke those opposing the 123 agreement. It is entirely possible that Sen spoke out of frustration, for, after all, he has been a key negotiator and has undoubtedly worked and lobbied hard to bring the agreement to near-fruition. But though Sen is a political appointee (he has retired from the Indian Foreign Service), he cannot ignore the fact that he serves the government of India and not the United Progressive Alliance or the Congress. We need to hear the voice of India emanating from our mission in Washington, not the voice of America. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshobhya, 

 Mysore 

 Sir Shuma Raha has rightly observed in her piece that our dignity is not so fragile as to crack under a tasteless video clip here or a vaguely rude comment there (Too much mischief, Aug 29). The kerfuffle over Ronen Sens remarks reminds me of the ruckus over more trifling matters such as Mandira Bedis sari, embellished with a number of flags, including Indias. Or take the fuss over the national songs tune being played at a function chaired by N.R. Narayanamoorthy. That we are still an immature nation is proved by the fact that we choose to be swayed by trivial and insignificant issues. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir The reason why proceedings in both houses of parliament have been held up over the last week or so is absolutely useless. Ronen Sen has not done or said anything for which he needs to apologize or resign from his post. He has merely voiced the sentiments of every sensible Indian concerned about national interest. The problem is that he dared to speak an unpleasant truth. He is an ambassador. Given his position, he may have spoken in a bit of haste. He should have given the consequences more thought considering the average intelligence quotient of our members of parliament than he may have done. Its the time that the Left and the National Democratic Alliance stopped criticizing the government and came round to acknowledging that the deal with the US is going to help the country gain energy security. The Opposition must stop playing the dirty game of politics on such a sensitive issue. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, 

 Bangalore

 Parting shot

 Sir Frequent visitors to the Calcutta airport must have noticed that the pace of work in extending the canopy outside the domestic terminal is excruciatingly slow. It is amazing that a simple project like this is yet to be completed after more than eight months. But then Bengal is known to work at its own pace. Which is why the extension of Calcuttas Metro rail is taking so long. The Union civil aviation ministry should call a global tender and award the project to a world-class contractor who will know how to deliver on time.

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Datta, 

 Calcutta

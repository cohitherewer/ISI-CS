 Letters to Editor

 Sing it out loud

 Sir It is said that what one says involuntarily is closer to the truth (Patriotism is no cakewalk, April 11). Thus, if it is true that Narayana Murthy preferred the instrumental version of the national anthem during the presidential visit to the Infosys premises, it shows how keen keen he is to placate foreigners by forsaking national pride. One would like to ask him if he was ever shown such courtesy during his innumerable visits abroad. The present controversy exposes the mental slavery of Indias pampered Information Technology sector. The industry, which depends heavily on dollar largesse, would go to any extent to protect its pocket. Perhaps IT professionals are justifiably mocked as cyber coolies.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa

 Sir The president himself had once expressed his pleasure with the idea of N.R. Narayana Murthy succeeding him to the post. However, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam would surely be shocked by Murthys remark that the national anthem was not sung during the presidents visit to avoid embarrassing foreign employees. One fails to understand how the presence of a handful of foreigners could make it difficult for Murthy to pay his respects to national symbols. India cannot expect to be respected by other nations if its citizens are irreverent themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshobhya, Mysore

 Sir There is no problem with an instrumental version of the national anthem being played when the president comes calling. But the reason that Narayana Murthy cited by way of explaining the incident is unacceptable. What made the Infosys chief think that foreigners present might have been embarrassed if the Indian national anthem was sung? The sanctity of Indias national anthem cannot be allowed to be violated under any circumstances. Murthys comment has only proved that he is not fit to become Indias president. He is better off as a corporate leader.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir An insult to the national flag or the national anthem is a punishable offence only if it is deliberate (Petty concerns, April 12). It would be wrong to accuse Sachin Tendulkar and Narayana Murthy of being unpatriotic. Neither of them had any intention to insult the nation or its symbols. Is it not true that miniature tricolours that are used for decorations on Independence Day end up in the gutter the next morning? By that logic, thousands of Indians need to be prosecuted every year for insulting the national flag. Besides, at big sporting events such as the football World Cup, the norm is to play the instrumental version of the national anthems of participating countries. Nobody has had a problem with that yet. Why is Murthy being singled out for criticism? Perhaps, some people are interested in gaining cheap publicity by tarnishing the image of a celebrity. It is more important to protect the ideals behind the flag and the anthem than merely showing token respect.

 Yours faithfully,

G.D. Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir If Narayana Murthy were to succeed A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, would he then refrain from singing the Indian national anthem out of respect for foreign dignitaries? Although Murthy was quick to apologize for hurting the sentiments of the people, the issue is unlikely to fizzle out soon. Especially since Sachin Tendulkar, another Indian icon, now stands accused of cutting a cake which had the national colours on it. Luckily for him, board officials have clarified that the crowd prevented Tendulkar from seeing what the colours of the cake were. Now if that is true, it may be argued that Tendulkar is colour-blind. How does he then make out the cricket ball from the background while batting? But it is not right to blame Tendulkar or Murthy alone. All celebrities in India have come to believe that they are not accountable to the law of the land. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir N.R. Narayana Murthy is not a politician. Therefore, he could not anticipate that the move to play the instrumental version of the national anthem would create a raging controversy (Money fine, not Murthy, April 14). It is unfortunate that some overzealous and patriotic politicians want Murthy arrested for his crime. Murthy is a learned man who does not understand the quirkiness of politics. It would be better if he steers clear of anything remotely political in future. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Erratum

 Sir In the article, The importance of being earnest (April 17), FC Kochin has been written as FC Kochi. The error is regretted.

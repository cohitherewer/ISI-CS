 Beware, insiders at work

Blind Men and the Elephant (Sage, Rs 395) by Was Rahman and Priya Kurien takes seriously the job of demystifying the global IT services industry. The authors, themselves IT and management professionals, promise to provide a non-technical and jargon-free view of the IT services industry, and they deliver. Among the main questions is the paradox: is the IT industry mans biggest technological revolution, or is it over-priced, incompetent and immature? Doubtless, those who fall outside the ambit of the industry are more likely to take the latter view (they always have friends in the IT sector who fail to solve simple problems, and hence, to justify their sky-high salaries. But those who start their working day at 7 am and still burn the midnight oil in the IT company offices, trying to meet impossible deadlines (sometimes even postponing their weddings to meet deadlines) would disagree. The global IT scene is laid out in detail, and the non-IT reader will find most of it eminently understandable. For the curious, the title of the book is from John Godfrey Saxes poem on the six blind men of Indostan who touch parts of an elephant and variously conclude that the animal resembles a wall, a rope, a sword, a tree, a snake or a fan, and though each was partly right/ All were in the wrong. 

Stormswift (Penguin, Rs 295) by Madeleine Brent is part of Penguins Retro Revival series. This Gothic novel revolves around Jemimah Lawley, who, at the age seventeen, becomes a slave, Lalla, in the tribal kingdom of Shul in the Hindu Kush mountains. She escapes, only to return to the kingdom. After much intrigue, death, disaster and identity crises, Jemimah/ Lalla finds happiness and love predictably. The real mystery of the novel stems not from the plot, but from the true identity of its author, which, till recently, was one of the best-kept secrets of the publishing world.

 Bollywood Roulette (Indialog, Rs 195) by Rahul Bajaj tells the story of strugglers in the Mumbai film industry. The author considers himself one, though, with degrees from the US and the UK, he can hardly be counted in the same league as Shiv Pandey, the Amitabh Bachchan fan in the novel who runs away from his home in Benares and sells his family buffaloes to pool money for an acting course that will give him a ticket to Bollywood. Not a bad try, considering that Bajaj is a K-serial actor.

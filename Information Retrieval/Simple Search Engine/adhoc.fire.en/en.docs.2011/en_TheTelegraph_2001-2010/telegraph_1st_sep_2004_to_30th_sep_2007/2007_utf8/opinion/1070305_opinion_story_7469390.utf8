The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 EXAMPLE MADE

 The bringing to book of errant public servants is invariably a cause of some jubilation in a democracy. It is assumed that those that are responsible for the running of the system should be accountable, and when they fail in carrying out their responsibilities they should be made examples of. This is perfectly reasonable since so much of the proper running of a democracy is actually dependant on committed public servants who are paid from the exchequer. In India, public servants are so rarely punished that the very occurrence of such an unusual thing calls forth consternation and then joy. This is exactly what happened when three very senior bureaucrats (two of them policemen) and one legislator were convicted and given jail sentences by the Calcutta high court. The charges contempt of court and misleading the court are serious, though the verdict is relatively light. Government servants in West Bengal have failed to carry out the orders of the court far too many times. The judges have some ground to be annoyed. The punishment meted out to the legislator is significant since the failure of public servants to carry out the courts directives is often linked to political pressure or their helplessness in the face of the power of political parties. Such pressure, and the consequent helplessness, cannot be excuses for inactivity resulting in the dereliction of duty.

 This judgment raises important questions for the functioning of the Indian democracy and the role of the judiciary. The latter has increasingly been called in to perform functions that are aimed at correcting dysfunctions in other organs of the State. The aims and intentions of the judges cannot be faulted in any way. They have taken upon themselves the onerous task of cleaning the Augean stables. This self-appointed task has increased the work-load of courts and created delays in their normal operations. The courts welcome effort to perform public service is not without its downside. While their lordships admonish members of the executive and legislators, they could also perhaps reflect a little on the functioning of the judiciary itself its speed, procedures and purview. It is paramount for democracy in India that the three pillars of the State function in a complementary manner instead of being at odds. It would be too optimistic to hope that the punishment to the public servants and the legislator is the beginning of a process of introspection.

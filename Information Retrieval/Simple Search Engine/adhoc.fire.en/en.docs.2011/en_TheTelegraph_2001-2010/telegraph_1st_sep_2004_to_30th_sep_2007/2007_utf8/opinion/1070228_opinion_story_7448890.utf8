 POLL WIND

 Three assembly-poll results do not make a trend. But the Congress will be fooling itself if it ignores the results that have come in from Uttarakhand and Punjab. In both places, it has lost ground to its principal opponent in national politics, the Bharatiya Janata Party. In Punjab, the gains of the BJP can perhaps be attributed to its alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal, but in Uttarakhand, the Congress has lost in a straight fight with the BJP. Even in Manipur, the third state where assembly elections were held, the victory of the Congress is by no means comfortable and unqualified. The Congress leadership would like to forget the last few days. The detention of Mr Ottavio Quattrocchi in Argentina and the subsequent botch-up by the government and the Central Bureau of Investigation, together with the election results, are bound to make the United Progressive Alliance very uncomfortable and more vulnerable to the BJPs attacks. It is too early to see signs of instability in the present dispensation, but the loss of two states will have an inevitably adverse effect on the morale of the Congress, if not on its future prospects.

 The usual theory about incumbency will again be rolled out to explain the defeat of the Congress in Punjab and in Uttarakhand. The inapplicability of the same theory in Manipur will be put down to the states exceptionalism from mainstream politics. The fact of the matter is that elections in India are unpredictable because they do not hinge on one overarching factor. This is particularly true for assembly-level polls in which local or regional issues inevitably influence the way people cast their ballots. In a country like India, the price of onions can determine the way people vote. Hence the inference that the biggest victim of these results may not be the Congress but the economic reforms programme. Defeat in elections is a stepping stone to populism in economic matters. There is irony in the results coming a day before the Union budget.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Grim future

 Sir The Telegraph deserves to be praised for bringing the plight of the workers of the closed tea gardens of Jalpaiguri to the front page (Bengals death harvest, June 6). The government of West Bengal may be making tall claims about the need for industrialization and progress, but it has actually stopped caring about the existing industries. The result is acute misery for the workers who have lost their jobs with the closure of tea gardens. The starvation deaths in Jalpaiguri prove the complete failure of the economic policy, both at Central and state levels. Of what advantage is the increased growth-rate of the gross domestic product when it does not generate new jobs for the unemployed? Should there not be an unemployment allowance for the displaced tea-garden workers? The gulf between the affluent and the poor is becoming too wide for comfort. If our political leaders have some human values left in them, they should try to close this deplorable divide. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Sunil M. Caleb,

 Sir It is strange that both the ruling Left Front and its chief opposition, the Trinamool Congress, are blissfully unconcerned about the fate of the tea garden workers when they are raising such hue and cry over the dispossessed farmers of Singur or Nandigram. Without an alternative source of livelihood, the workers are finding it difficult to sustain themselves ever since the tea gardens started closing down from 2002. The facts of the matter were acknowledged by the state government only when the media focussed attention on their ordeal. But despite the truth staring in its face, the government refuses to admit either starvation or malnutrition as the cause of the workers deaths. Only extreme callousness can cause the government to close its eyes to the reality. As the governor of West Bengal, Gopalkrishna Gandhi, told the junior PWD minister, Manohar Tirkey, one only has to look at the sick children to find proof of malnutrition. 

 It would not be enough to provide mere relief to the suffering workers. They have to be rehabilitated and ensured of jobs in the near future. Mamata Banerjee could take a break from hogging the limelight for herself and help the 17,000 jobless labourers of the tea gardens. As it is, the Nandigram issue is wearing thin. Banerjees prospects in the next elections might just be brightened if she takes up the cause of the Jalpaiguri workers now. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is easy for the reader of a newspaper, seated in the comfort of his home, perhaps with a steaming cup of tea in hand, to read about the starving tea-garden workers. He could sympathize with them perfunctorily, self-righteously put the blame on the government and then conveniently forget the issue. While the government is obviously accountable for the misery of the unemployed workers, the wealthy can be held equally responsible for it. The concentration of money in the hands of the prosperous few has resulted in the extreme deprivation of those in the lowest rungs of society. Hence it becomes the obligation of the former group of people to actively help their less fortunate brethren. Since we enjoy the benefits of the labour of the tea garden workers everyday, each of us should come forward to help them stave off starvation. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 S. Datta,

 Braveheart

 Sir It is time educational institutions like the Indian Institutes of Management became more transparent in their admission procedure. Vaishnavi, the visually impaired examinee of the common admission test from Bangalore, has acted rightly by questioning the relative weight given to the three segments of the admission process (Blind girl fights IIM, June 3). Since sitting for the CAT entails months of laborious study, the failed examinees have every right to insist on a review of the manner of admission, especially if they feel that they had fared well in the interview and the group discussion. Vaishnavis challenge is already bringing many hitherto unknown facts out in the open. Most examinees had so long known that the interview and GD are given equal weightage. But senior IIM officials have now said that the GD has one-and-a-half-times the weight of the interview. If this is a fact, then it should be mentioned as such in the admission brochure. Students cannot have their future be made or destroyed by arbitrary quirks of the admission process.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Avinash Gupta, 

 Bandel

 Sir Many examinees must have despaired on failing to see their names on the CAT list. But while students from the general category failed to raise their voice in protest, the visually-impaired Vaishnavi bravely challenged the admission procedure. She has even moved the Central information commission. Under the Right to Information Act, IIMs are obliged to show her the relevant documents. 

 Yours faithfully,

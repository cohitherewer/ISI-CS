 Letters to Editor

 Cast in stone

 An affair to remember

Sir The electronic media had relentlessly campaigned for the Taj Mahal, urging Indians to vote for the monument so that it made it to the new list of the Seven Wonders of the World. It was a jingoistic and gimmicky campaign. The Taj needs no such crusade to establish its timeless beauty. If at all a new list of the worlds wonders was necessary, it should have been compiled by Unesco, the cultural wing of the United Nations, and not by any private organization or individual. The vote-by-SMS was a good ploy for private mobile operators to make a fortune. These jingoists would have served the Taj better had they tried to save it from pollution by campaigning to make Agra a clean city or for the de-silting of the Yamuna.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Dasghara, Burdwan

 Sir The government of India should celebrate the Taj Mahals making it to the top of the new list of the worlds seven wonders by issuing a commemorative series of currency notes, coins and postage stamps, all depicting the Taj. Although the Union government did not officially mobilize people to vote for the Taj, the tourism ministers personal appeal encouraged celebrities and the media to launch a campaign for the Taj. This caused Indians across the world to cast their votes for the monument. The renewed interest in the Taj is a wonderful opportunity to promote tourism in the country, and the concerned ministry should grab the chance.

 Although many celebrities participated in the campaign with the help of free airtime provided by news channels, there were others, notably our cricketers, who did not cast in their lot. They, perhaps, cannot spare time for shoots which bring in no moolah. They should learn from the Brazilian football team which campaigned relentlessly for the recognition of their heritage.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir I dont know how many of those who sent SMS votes for the Taj Mahal have actually visited the monument. The white marble of the Taj symbolizes the purity of real love; and somehow love and beauty seem close together in this creation, said the former first lady of the United States of America, Eleanor Roosevelt. For lovers of true beauty, the Taj Mahal is like a poem, and surely its beauty and significance as a monument symbolizing immortal love will not diminish, irrespective of whether it features in any kind of global wonders list. Unesco was correct in drawing up its own criteria for selection instead of depending on mass-voting.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The jubilation in sections of the Indian population and the media over the inclusion of Taj Mahal in the so-called New 7 Wonders list betrays a lack of maturity and perspective. Even if the list were to be sanctioned by Unesco, it is no big achievement to be included in a list where there are millions of Indians voting several times over. Indians should shed their Guinness Book mentality and concentrate on real achievements. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aroup Chatterjee, London 

 Sir The recent hoopla over a mausoleum constructed by an unkind and philandering emperor is perhaps promoting wrong role models. Shah Jahans accession was marked by a lot of bloodshed. He killed his own brothers, among them Shahryar, the son-in-law of Nur Jahan. Shah Jahans philandering has also been extensively documented. He is alleged to have had an affair with Mumtaz Mahals sister, and fathered a son by her. The emperor is also reputed to have had an incestuous relationship with his daughter, Jahanara. According to Francois Bernier, the mullahs justified the relationship on the plea that it would have been unjust to deny the king the privilege of gathering fruit from the tree he himself had planted .

 The Taj Mahal is not necessarily a symbol of love and faithfulness. Rather, it is an act of repentance for the emperors infidelity. Mumtaz Mahal was married to Shah Jahan in 1612 and died in 1631 in Burhanpur, now in Madhya Pradesh, while giving birth to their fourteenth child. Inflicting fourteen pregnancies in nineteen years of conjugal life was irresponsible on the part of the emperor, even by the standards of the time. Lord Bentinck had allegedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off its marble. We need not go that far. Let the Taj stay, as it is, as a mausoleum and an architectural feat, but nothing more. Glamourizing the Taj Mahal will promote wrong values among our children. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir One hopes the interest in the Taj will not end with its election to the top of the list of the worlds wonders. Indians should not think they have done their bit for their neglected cultural heritage just by voting for the monument. A lot needs to be done.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Mahato, Calcutta

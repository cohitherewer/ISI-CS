The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FAILED, OLD PLOY

 It is not difficult to see what the United Liberation Front of Asom wants to achieve with its latest spurt of violence. It would like to use deaths and terror to put pressure on the government to resume the stalled peace process. This is an old ploy that did not work in the past and should not be allowed to do so in the future. That is not to say that the peace talks should not be revived. But neither New Delhi nor Dispur should do anything to give the impression that it is reacting in panic. If the last peace initiative broke down, it was because of Ulfas unrealistic demands and belligerent posturings. The militants failed to respond even to the armys unilateral ceasefire. Instead, they sought to use the truce in order to re-group and re-arm themselves. But the corpses that lay strewn on Guwahatis streets last Saturday also symbolized the bloody mess into which the ethnic insurgency has degenerated. In the name of fighting the Indian State, Ulfas cadre have been killing innocent Assamese. Although its leaders claim to have no parochial motives, the killings and torture of people from non-Assamese communities are proof of their moral bankruptcy. The movement for a sovereign Assam has become a victim of its own violence. 

 Ironically, the bloodbath in Guwahati came a day before the celebrations that the government of Tarun Gogoi had planned in order to mark the first anniversary of his second term in office. Mr Gogoi should seriously ponder what he has really achieved in his battle with Ulfa over the past one year. After all, what he does with Ulfas challenge has a larger impact for the whole state. If Assams capital city has suffered five bomb blasts in a month, it is a poor reflection on the governments ability to provide security to the common people. Mr Gogoi must rethink his governments strategy to battle Ulfa and ask himself why it has failed repeatedly. He cannot complain that he does not have enough Central forces to help the state. The problem, it seems, has more to do with the functioning of the unified command that comprises the army, the state police and the paramilitary forces. Before Mr Gogoi prepares to resume the peace initiative, he needs to put his own house in order. He has an advantage in that public opinion has never been so unequivocally critical of Ulfa. He cannot afford to appear to be a helpless witness of Assams bloody drift.

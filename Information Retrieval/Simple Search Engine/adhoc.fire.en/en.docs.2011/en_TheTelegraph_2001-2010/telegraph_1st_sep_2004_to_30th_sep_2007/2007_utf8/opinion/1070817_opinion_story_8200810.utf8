The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Little trouble

 All play, little work

Sir I feel obliged to comment on Vishnupriya Senguptas article, Ways to catch them young (Aug 14). Ironically, my article on the same issue, Start at the beginning, was published in The Telegraph on April 4, 2006. 

 Journalistic ethics demand that a topic should be researched and the facts checked out from all parties concerned before an article is published. It is surprising that Sengupta, clearly a champion of hard-hit Montessori schools, thought it fit to interview the principal of a Montessori school as well as the principal of a reputed high school, but not the principal of a high school that she has charged (by name) of admitting toddlers. The other high school she has similarly accused is my alma mater. I was admitted into its beautiful non-Montessori nursery at the age of three, several decades ago. 

 Modern High School for Girls has a nursery section for children who are ready for play school. Our school has the space, the equipment and the know-how to run such a section. If Sengupta were to carry out an inspection, she would discover to her surprise that our nursery children are not intentionally burdened with school bags or anything else for that matter. 

 It is unlikely that the principal who has given her expert comments has interacted with our nursery staff, studied the nature and quality of their work or ascertained their salary structure. Our nursery staff are all experienced and more than adequately qualified to do the work they are entrusted with. The same anonymous principal of a reputed high school has talked about the good business sense of high schools that have opened pre-primary sections, and called it lucrative business. I doubt that this principal has examined the balance sheet of all these schools, so motives should not be attributed without evidence. According to basic management principles, which school heads are expected to know, any organization that aims for excellence must also aim to be financially sound. In any case, business sense should not be equated with sharp practice.

 We give due respect to Madame Montessori in the centenary year of her system of education. However, it is universally accepted that there are other recognized methods of nurturing young children. In a democratic set-up in the 21st century, we should have the freedom to choose to be eclectic. We need to keep abreast of new trends and to continue trying to improve upon systems and approaches in the context of a fast-changing world. 

 Fortunately, parents too have an increasingly wide choice right from the pre-primary stage to high school. Schools have been known to add a plus-two section and even a college over the years. Provided it is run properly, there is no reason why a high school should be prohibited from including a pre-primary section. Good schools will never object to being officially inspected by an apolitical and disinterested body. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Devi Kar, Principal, Modern High School for Girls, Calcutta

 Sir Contrary to Vishnupriya Senguptas opinion, it is not so much the death of Montessori schools that ought to worry us. We must think of the two-year-old who comes under parental pressure the minute he nears this age. This is the time when preparations start for the childs school admission.

 There are good play schools for such young children where the number of pupils in each class is kept to the minimum. The institution ensures that learning remains enjoyable for the child so that he feels happy, secure and confident. A serious thought should also be given to the implementation of the April, 2007 directive of the Delhi high court. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhag Mehta, Calcutta 

 Might is not right

 Sir Many of us have been scandalized by recent events in Hyderabad. The physical assault on Taslima Nasreen was entirely uncalled for. The increase in the number of violent incidents of this kind indicates that the rule of law is ceasing to exist in this country. Any group of people, of whatever affiliation, can take the law into their own hands and brutally assault those whose opinions they do not agree with, and get away with the assault. Threats from groups such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Majlis-e-Itahadul-Musalmeen, and there is little to choose between them in terms of their tactics, have pulverized Indian society into accepting violence as a way of countering contrary opinion. 

 We are equally scandalized that those who are supposedly the protectors of the rule of law seem to be more partial towards the perpetrators of violence than to its victim. Are we to assume that this is now the new definition of protecting the rule of law and of dispensing justice?

 Perhaps we need to turn our attention away from the daily chorus of our improving rate of growth and pay more attention to what constitutes the quality of our citizenship, a quality that seems to be rapidly eroding. The deafening silence on these physical assaults from those who are the arbiters of citizenship points in only one direction that the values that we had associated with Indian citizenship are being shamelessly subordinated to the arithmetic of electoral politics. This can only portend the worst form of social viciousness that will come to govern Indian society.

 Yours faithfully,

Andr Bteille, Rajeev Bhargava, Partha Chatterjee, Deepak Nayyar and Romila Thapar, New Delhi and Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Stinking nation

 Sir The report, Moral MP caught with fake wife (April 19), hardly comes as a surprise. It is unfortunate that India, the largest democracy in the world, is full of corrupt politicians. Hitherto, quite a few members of parliament and legislative assemblies have been accused of heinous crimes such as murder, kidnapping and financial embezzlement. Now, with Babubhai Katara in the net, the list includes human trafficking as well. Unless radical reforms are instituted by an ever vigilant judiciary, the tribe of offending MPs and MLAs will swell at the cost of the nation.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir Merely suspending Babubhai Katara from the Bharatiya Janata Party cannot remove the inherent flaws in the legislative system. The misdeeds of parliamentarians can only be checked by abolishing the clause of immunity provided to them, a step which would make them more accountable to the law. The airport official who caught Katara, trying to use fake passports to smuggle a woman and his son to Toronto, deserves to be promoted. The officials who issued boarding passes to Katara and his fellow passengers should be discharged from duty.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Babubhai Kataras arrest and his subsequent suspension by the BJP for the use of illegal passports demolishes the myth that politicians can get away with their crimes because of their supposed elevated status. The BJP, by expelling Katara almost immediately after getting to know of his offence, has set a high moral standard. Also, the arrest of Katara proves that, on some occasions, the police do not hesitate in discharging their duties, no matter how well-connected the suspect is. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir Babubhai Katara should be kept out of public office for good. Although the nexus between politicians and human traffickers has been exposed, concerned citizens still have every reason to be apprehensive about Kataras fate. It is possible that the legal team defending the MP will be able to save the skin of its client. The Katara episode proves how audacious corrupt and high-ranking politicians have become in a successful democracy like ours. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir The authorities dealing with the Babubhai Katara scandal will find the going difficult (Web of VIPs in scam, April 23). What initially looked like a one-off incident, involving a handful of people, has now grown into a full-fledged national scam. The criminals involved in trafficking are spread all over the country, especially in Andhra Pradesh. With more names of politicians, bureaucrats, travel agents, corporate executives and so on emerging by the day, one simply cannot believe that Indias manipulated, exploited and corrupt police forces are going to crack the case in its entirety and put the accused behind bars. 

 Yours faithfully,

D.K. Banerjee, Kharagpur

 Sir MPs and ministers with diplomatic passports should have their persons, credentials and companions thoroughly scrutinized while travelling. This can check illegal activities such as human-trafficking, drug-smuggling, gun-running, money-laundering and the like in a small way. Like politicians, ordinary people are also involved in such crimes. But, unlike our netas, they are not resourceful and are more likely to get caught. Besides, when a politician is involved in a crime such as trafficking, the injury to the nation is greater. As far as the selection of MPs is concerned, there ought to be stricter vigilance on Rajya Sabha candidates. The upper house selects its members by a process that can, at best, be called whimsical. At the same time, the major political parties should reach a consensus in order to debar individuals with a criminal background from contesting elections. After all, the Supreme Court alone cannot be expected to battle corruption in politics. The politicians need to do their bit to cleanse the system as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

 Sir Babubhai Katara had been involved in human trafficking for quite some time. This clearly shows that he had spread his tentacles deep inside the immigration offices. Apart from punishing Katara and his clients, strict action should be taken against all the officials and private agencies suspected of having a role in this murky affiar. The Katara episode should shut the Bharatiya Janata Partys mouth too. Henceforth, it would do well to discard its holier-than-thou attitude. Merely suspending Katara and the other MPs named by Sunderlal Yadav will not allow the respective political parties to escape the charges of corruption that are periodically levelled against them. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

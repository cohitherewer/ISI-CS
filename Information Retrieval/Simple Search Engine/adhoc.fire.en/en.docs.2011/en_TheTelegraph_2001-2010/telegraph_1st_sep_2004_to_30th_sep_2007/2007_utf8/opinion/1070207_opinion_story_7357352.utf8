The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FLOW CHART

 It is unlikely that even after 17 years, the Cauvery water disputes tribunal has managed to say the last word on the matter it was called to adjudicate on. Of the four riparian states involved, two Karnataka and Kerala are already intent on seeking a review of the decision. And the mood, ebullient for now in Tamil Nadu, may turn brooding if the murmur of discontent over its allocated share of river-water gets stronger. The objections of the states will, obviously, be levelled against the tribunals getting the figures wrong again. Unfortunately, the problem is not strictly a mathematical one, to be solved by the best permutation of numbers. The trouble over acute water shortage has, over the years, become embroiled in regional chauvinism and selfish politicking, particularly in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu the chief contending parties in the conflict. In both the states, politicians have used the emotive appeal of the issue to suit their interests. They have, in the process, created an intractable situation, where agreeing on any arrangement with the opponent is regarded as selling out the states interests. Thus, no matter how closely the allocation reflects the realistic needs of the states, their leadership is under an obligation to resist it. This trend is not peculiar to the Cauvery dispute alone. It characterizes the other irreconcilable differences over river-water-sharing between Punjab and Haryana or between Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, to name a few. In their hurry to outbid the other, states not only ride roughshod over awards by tribunals, but undermine judicial authority as well.

 Unfortunately, apart from appointing a referee to adjudicate the dispute and maintaining an ostrich-like posture, the Centre is not allowed to do much in such state subjects by the Constitution. Yet, given Indias water-intensive way of life and the looming water shortage as a result, the Centre cannot stay away from the matter for long. Together with the states, it has to devise ways towards better water conservation and management. Workable solutions through the proper use of ground- and surface-water resources, water-harvesting and a change in the crop-pattern should be looked at sincerely and implemented systematically. Perhaps these, rather than ambitious projects that may heighten Centre-state conflicts and further displacement, will save India.

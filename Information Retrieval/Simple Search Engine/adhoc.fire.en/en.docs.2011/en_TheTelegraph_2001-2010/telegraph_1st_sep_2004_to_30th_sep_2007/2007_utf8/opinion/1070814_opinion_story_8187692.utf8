 WRONG MEDICINE

 What happens when over a hundred million children are condemned to attend school, where they learn little? asks Satrujit Banerjee

 Not a balanced diet

 In comparing the strides made by the economies of India and China, Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist stated, The difference (in India and Chinas economies) has not so much to do with democracy, but (with Indias ) failure to invest in education and health. Given Indias deplorable illiteracy index and non-existent healthcare facilities in much of the rural areas, it is a fair comment. However, it appears that all this is about to change, at least in education. In a full- page advertisement featured in this daily on June 30, the department of school education and literacy, government of India, published the official figures of funds released and utilized by its flagship project, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, for the year 2006-07. The total expenditure incurred is Rs 14,779.30 crore against Rs 6,591.14 crore the previous year. More than doubling the expenditure in a single year is noteworthy by any standards. Now that the expenditure is in place, let us examine how we are faring in educating people. 

 According to the 2001 census, 94 per cent of all villages have a primary school within one kilometre. This in itself seems quite an achievement as one kilometre is not difficult to trudge, even for a six-year-old. There is no denying that the crucial first step has been taken. However, to find out more about how these schools are doing and what kind of education is being imparted in these schools, the census is inadequate. But help is at hand, thanks to a truly remarkable educational NGO, Pratham. In its first annual survey of education report, carried out in 2005, it ascertained that 93.4 per cent of the children in the appropriate age group are enrolled in a school. It looks and sounds impressive until you work out that this translates to more than 10 million children being out of school. 

 Be that as it may, the vast majority of parents have accepted, in principle, that their children need to go to school. To find out what they are learning in school, one has to revisit ASER. It turns out that when a nationally representative sample of six to fourteen-year-olds was given a test in reading and mathematics, only 43 per cent of them could do simple one-digit subtractions and divisions and only 60 per cent could read at a second grade level. And herein lies the failure of the system in which more than half of the over hundred million children who are at school, mostly from poor families, are condemned to attending classes without really learning anything. No wonder the average child attends school only about 70 per cent of the time. 

 What steps need to be taken to improve the quality of education in schools attended by children from poor families? If your answer is better textbooks, better teacher training and more teachers, which come to mind first, it must be pointed out that these have been tried. The much-publicized education reform programme of the Nineties, the district primary education programme, did cover these areas, obviously without much success. The ASER study also finds that the strength of the class is, on an average, 30 to 40 students, which is not bad for a country of Indias size and economic standing. Moreover, it is not only the poor states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Orissa that are lagging behind. In comparatively well off states like Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat, only 40 per cent of the children in class V can do one-digit subtraction and division. 

 In an effort to get to the root of the problem, the World Bank, in collaboration with Harvard University, sent a group of observers unannounced to 3,700 public and private schools in India on three separate occasions. They found that 25 per cent of teachers were absent on any given day. Of the teachers present, only 45 per cent were actually teaching when the observers arrived. The rest were drinking tea, or talking to other teachers, or reading the newspaper. Is this because the teachers are underpaid? A World Bank study using recent National Sample Survey data concluded that teachers are paid about 80 per cent more than people in the private sector (not just teachers) with the same qualifications.

 To solve the problem, the government has come up with a new mantra decentralization. A village education committee has been set up in every village, with representation from parents, to monitor how the schools are faring. Yet in a survey in rural east UP, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an astonishing 92 per cent of parents of children in government schools said that they did not know of any such committee. Of those who do know that they are a part of the committee, roughly two-thirds are unaware of SSA despite the fact that it comes with a substantial amount of money for the school. This is not surprising as most parents surveyed are not literate and thus cannot pass judgments on the quality of teaching. Moreover, the teachers form an extremely powerful, articulate and visible block in the villages, and are patronized by all political parties. 

 As for the other VEC members, the headmaster and the village pradhan, it is obviously not in their interest to upset the applecart, given the money it brings. The challenge in reforming education is to make teachers take teaching seriously, and one cannot do that without upsetting large numbers of teachers. Empowering parents through VECs will also not work in places where the parents are not in a position to take the erring teachers to task. In the 2007 budget, the allocation for mid-day meals under SSA has been increased from Rs 17,133 crore to Rs 23,142 crore. It may rope in a few more students but will they learn anything worthwhile ? Throwing money at a problem and hoping that it will go away is not the way to go about in sharing the spoils of growth. 

 But perhaps more damaging is the bringing up of hundreds of millions of what are, in effect, victims of fraud of an elaborate scam called schooling. What happens when children with six or eight years of schooling discover that they have very little to show for it? Is government schooling bringing up a whole new maladjusted generation who will blame society for giving them hope, perhaps opportunity too, and then taking it away? The debate is not about the diagnosis, it is about the prescription.

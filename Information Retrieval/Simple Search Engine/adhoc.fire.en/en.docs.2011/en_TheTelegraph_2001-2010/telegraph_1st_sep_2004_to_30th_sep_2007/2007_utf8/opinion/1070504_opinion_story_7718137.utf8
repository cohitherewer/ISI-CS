The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ON ANOTHER LEVEL

 BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh

 The endless chatter on television and in the press about who should be the next president of India is unwarranted because it amounts to lobbying, which is unbefitting of the office of the person mandated to protect the Constitution. To remain non-partisan in and unaffected by compelling but contrary political shenanigans requires adherence to some basic rules. Apart from personal integrity a given for anyone who resides in Rashtrapati Bhavan professional excellence must be the foremost criterion. A good person is not good enough because many are good. Exceptional is the definition of the stuff presidents are made of.

 A competent businessman, or any other professional who has achieved what he was meant to achieve, does not fit the bill of a presidential nominee. There are hundreds of such people, pioneers in their area of work, men and women who have generated wealth and some who have supported charities. Others have worked tirelessly in the social sector and been successful in changing the lives of the less privileged. They should be saluted for their endeavours and celebrated for their successes.

 If I recall correctly, no Indian president has had two terms bar one, Rajendra Prasad, the first incumbent in the chair. One term is what it should be. Every president should know that. It allows for free and fair appraisals of unfolding events and frustrates all human weaknesses that may raise their little heads. It also prevents cynical politicians from playing games of trying to entice opinions and proclamations in lieu of a possible second term. To keep politicking out of the realm of the presidency is a must if we are to preserve the dignity of the highest office of this land.

 Second term

 The other rather unpleasant exercise that is presently being carried out is the campaign for a second term for the incumbent president by the national press. For television channels to conduct polls via the short messaging service and organize shows around the subject of who should be the president is unwarranted. It is not their business. Why is the media lobbying? Surely their job is to report, analyse and expose the many truths that confront us. Is it their desperation to play politics rather than enhance their own profession that drives their obsession? All the lines that demarcate different roles are beginning to blur and the result is anarchy of thought and action. Scary.

 To constantly harp on the minority or caste card for this post is quite repugnant and speaks volumes about the simplistic use of affirmative action. Surely caste, creed, faith or gender should never enter the fray of exceptional excellence. It should not matter at all when selecting a president who is there to represent all Indians regardless of caste, creed, faith and gender and uphold the values enshrined in our Constitution. Partisan politics, has, over recent years, demeaned this and other such institutional positions and helped corrode the dignity of our plural society by diluting the values and ethics that governed our civilization.

 We must respect the presidency and not reduce it to the level of politics. The political space will have to cleanse itself if democracy is to survive. All presidents must rise above the play of all politics, healthy or base, and protect the rules of the Indian Constitution. All presidents should demit office with dignity and not find themselves embroiled in controversy or become pawns in the hands of opposing political groups. The possibility is disturbing, to say the least. Let us not pollute the one aspect of our polity that has managed to stay away from the virus that plagues India and Bharat. That is the pledge we should renew in this sixtieth anniversary year of our independence.

 The media too must remain aloof from politics if they are to be effective as an important pillar of Indian democracy.

 SOME USELESS SHELLS REMAIN

 RESTORATION DRAMA

 So many of Calcuttas landmarks are being erased

 The cyberworld exists in a reality of its own. Google Great Eastern Hotel and immediately the search engine takes you to Yahoo Travel which gives you the impression that the historic hotel at 1 to 3 Old Court House Street is still functional. Even the rates are posted. A visitor in 2000, while referring jokingly to the unbelievably liberal use of the term luxury in relation to the hotel which opened in 1835 and which Tagore in his autobiography called Wilsons Hotel is nonetheless floored by the indefinable charm of the huge rooms, musty odours, and ever-obliging staff.

 Now only the shell of this hotel has survived the depredations of the Bharat Group of Hotels, which, in collaboration with Architects 61 of Singapore, and Dulal Mukherjee amp; Associates, is apparently involved in the restoration of a hospitality address which boasted such hotspots as Sherrys and Maxims and the grandest of grand staircases. All this has been erased forever. Apart from the thin wall facing Old Court House Street, the massive structure is beyond recall. If this happens in the name of restoration, conservation and heritage, why should developers need the demolition squad any more?

 It is true that as the last resort, only the faade of a heritage building is maintained and the rest wiped out. But will the National Library remain the same if its large hall goes? Think of the Grand Hotel without the ballroom. Was the solidly-built Great Eastern Hotel really beyond repair?

 Architect Dulal Mukherjee, whose services were sought to implement this project, has in the past overseen the yet-to-be-complete conservation of Metropolitan Building. Now, although the building looks smart from outside, it has lost all its stained-glass windows and marble floors. What is worse, after a spell of heavy rain, it pours through the leaking roof and the gorgeous wooden staircases feel this cataracts full impact.

 After the restoration of the Town Hall was completed, Mukherjee had suggested that an office complex be built behind it. Mercifully, that project was nixed. More recently, he had designed the Gateway of Calcutta, conceived by the former mayor, Subrata Mukherjee. It raised such an outcry that it had to go. 

 In the case of Great Eastern Hotel, Chittaranjan Panda, curator of Victoria Memorial Hall, was willing, by his own admission, to offer his knowledge of history if it were sought. It is not known if he has already cast his pearls of wisdom before the hoteliers. 

 As usual, the heritage committee has been sleeping on its job. It never raised a finger when the Dunlop headquarters on Free School Street were demolished. Calcutta is currently witnessing the ruin of some other prominent landmarks. College Street Market, where for generations Bengali girls used to shop for their trousseau, is no more. The state government, which has earlier constructed the toadstool-like Bidyut Bhavan in Salt Lake and the monstrous secretariat at 4 Camac Street, is building a market complex there.

 Calcutta, in the grip of mall-eria, is turning the rock solid Mackinnon amp; Mackenzie building into a mall. First there was a fire. Then it was left to its own devices. Now it has been disembowelled.

 It waits to be seen if a fate worse than death awaits the house of R.N. Mukherjee. It will soon be turned into a boutique-heritage hotel. The house of the greatest Bengali entrepreneur should have been turned into a museum. Instead, it will be transformed into a five-star hotel in an already overcrowded street. We forget that exclusivity is the USP of boutique hotels, where less is more. Calcuttas heritage is in danger. Those who are supposed to protect it are indifferent. The public does not even know.

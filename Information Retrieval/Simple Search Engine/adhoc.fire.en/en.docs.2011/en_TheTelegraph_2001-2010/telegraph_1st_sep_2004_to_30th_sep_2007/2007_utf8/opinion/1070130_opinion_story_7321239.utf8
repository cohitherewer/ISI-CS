 KILLING A HOPE

 Gwynne Dyer

 When they buried Hrant Dink in Istanbul last Tuesday (January 23), more than 100,000 Turks came to his funeral, filling the streets and chanting We are all Armenians. There is a war going on for the soul of Turkey, but at least a lot of Turks are on the right side.

 Dink, who called himself an Armenian from Turkey and a good Turkish citizen, was murdered because he insisted on talking about the great crime that happened 92 years ago: the mass murder of most of Turkeys Armenian population in eastern Anatolia. The newspaper he founded and edited, Agos, had a small circulation, but his outspoken editorials made him one of Turkeys most famous journalists and a target for assassination.

 His killer, 17-year-old Ogun Samast, was a semi-educated young thug from the north-east of Anatolia. He was given the gun by a group of older ultra-nationalists including Yusuf Hayal, who was convicted of bombing a McDonalds restaurant in Trabzon in 2004. But these marginal characters are just pawns in the larger war between those who want a more democratic, more tolerant Turkey and those who are desperately defending the power and privileges of the old republican elite.

 Samast shot Dink in front of his office. I feel no remorse, the killer allegedly said, He said that Turkish blood was dirty blood. Of course, Dink never said any such thing. What he actually said, in an article addressed to his fellow Armenians, was that their obsession with the massacres of 1915-17 was having a poisonous effect on your blood.

 Slow but steady

 Its easy to see how Samast could have believed that Dink was an enemy of the Turks. Just over a year ago, a Turkish court took that phrase out of context, found Dink guilty of insulting Turkishness, and gave him a six-month suspended sentence. A number of other Turkish citizens, including Nobel Prize-winning author, Orhan Pamuk, have been prosecuted under the same law for daring to discuss what happened to the Armenians, and most of them have received death threats too.

 It really is a kind of war, and the villains of the piece are the army officers, judges and senior civil servants who were once seen as the guardians of the republican tradition, the people who were going to modernize and democratize Turkey. Unfortunately, republican does not really mean the same as democratic. For a long time, it meant the harsh tutelage of an elite, who were determined to Westernize the country. The republican elite rewrote history (including the denial of the Armenian massacres) and saw religion as a retrograde force that must be banned from politics.

 Much of the elites dream came to pass. Turkey today has a per capita income higher than Romania or Bulgaria. Democracy is a reality, and the current prime minister, Recep Tayyib Erdogan, leads a party whose members openly refer to themselves as Muslim Democrats. Under Erdogan, there have been reforms designed to qualify Turkey for European Union membership. But all this threatens both the rigidly secular ideology and the autocratic privileges of the old republican elite.

 From their powerful positions in the army, the judiciary and the bureaucracy, they work to undermine the reforms and to wreck Turkeys chances of joining the EU. In de facto alliance with ultra-nationalist right-wing parties that also oppose EU membership, they incite hatred of minorities, bring false prosecutions against the advocates of a more open Turkish society, and pursue the long-term goal of destabilizing the democratic order.

 But the war is not over yet, and the good guys have not lost. The foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, vowed last November to change or abolish Article 301, and last week 100,000 Turks thronged the streets of Istanbul to mourn the countrys best-known Armenian and condemn his murderers.

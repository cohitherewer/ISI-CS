 BEYOND TAINT

 The nature and scope of Ms Mayavatis political triumph are getting clearer by the day. She has been seeing herself as considerably more than a political leader rather, as the head of a social movement. This image can be further aggrandized now by the Uttar Pradesh governors granting her (and a cabinet colleague) immunity from prosecution in the Taj corridor case. T.V. Rajeswar believes that the evidence against her is not enough. If Mr Rajeswars order goes unchallenged, then, at one stroke, Ms Mayavati could claim to have outshone some of the countrys most important institutions: the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Supreme Court and, of course, the Taj Mahal. What does the governors order override? The Taj corridor scam is linked with corruption charges involving such a large sum of money that the hugeness of the amount itself had formed the basis of Ms Mayavatis sense of absurdity. How could any one in his right mind, she asked incredulously, accuse her of siphoning off Rs 175 crore? So, isnt this all obviously political? Yet, the nations highest judicial body has, more than once, clearly stated that it wanted the investigations to follow their own course. 

 In 2003, the Supreme Court ordered that a first information report be made against Ms Mayavati, initiating the CBI inquiry. A couple of years later, when the CBI wanted to stop its investigations, the court again overruled this, bringing in the Central Vigilance Commission. The CVC then declared that there was enough material to warrant further inquiry, on the basis of which the case was renewed in a special court. So, the governors latest order actually overturns the Supreme Courts position, which has been against closing the case. It is the apex court itself, which has recently ruled, in another case, that the governors permission is not required in trying a public servant. So, it could be just a public-interest petition, invoking this precedent, that might open the governors order to a judicial review. Hardheaded lookers-on might even point out that none of this is politically disinterested. Nothing less than who the nations next president is going to be now depends on Ms Mayavatis political support. The Congress, and the coalition that it heads, cannot afford to be indifferent to her predicament. Besides, the CBI, and governors in general, have been known to be not entirely beyond politics.

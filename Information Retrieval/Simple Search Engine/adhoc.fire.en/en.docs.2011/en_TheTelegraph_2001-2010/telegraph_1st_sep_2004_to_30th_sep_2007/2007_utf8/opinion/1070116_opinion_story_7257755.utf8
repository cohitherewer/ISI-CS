 BEING HIT BELOW THE BELT

 Malvika Singh

 With Amar Singh publicly abusing the governor of Uttar Pradesh, calling him names, the base reality of the Indian political scene has been reinforced yet again. We, the dignified citizens of this land, find such behaviour unacceptable in any and every sphere of public and private life and, therefore, tend to push the horror to the back of our minds till we are rudely shaken up during the period leading to elections. Only insecure and guilty politicians descend to these abysmal levels, indicating that their parties are in a disarray. Listening to him rave, one was reminded of the abusive campaign launched by the BJP against Sonia Gandhi, one that hit below the belt on personal non-issues, and one that was partly responsible for its defeat at the polls.

 The Samajwadi Party is clearly on the backfoot, having reduced law and order, dignity and integrity, hope and aspirations to unimaginable levels. At times like this, traditional voting patterns based on caste issues and suchlike are jolted out of the predictable, and citizens feel the need to vote differently if only to get rid of the gross exploitation they have been through at all levels of life. Mayavati is there, salivating as she sees a possibility of becoming the chief minister of the state again, leading a messy coalition. How long that kind of government, a tasteless kedgeree, will last, is anybodys guess. The BJP seems to be resurrecting itself in some areas where those poor people Hindus by faith who sit just above the line that separates them from the untouchables have joined that partys cause in the hope of regaining lost respect, recognition and pride. They want to identify with what they see as the mainstream.

 Sinking deeper

 Where is the Congress in all this? Is it waiting in the wings to receive votes which are not committed? When people cannot see the alternative, they tend to go for the known, lesser evil rather than the incumbent and more recent governments, which have failed to govern. Uttar Pradesh has never been as anarchic as it is today. To think it brings 80 elected members to the Lok Sabha, and holds the key to government-formation at the Centre, is frightening, to say the least. This state needs to be divided into four more parts, making for smaller, more viable units that could be governed better and brought at par with other sister states that have moved ahead and taken off. Why damn the people living in the heartland of India with corrupt and selfish politics? Will the people respond and grow out of their parochial positions and voting patterns? Will they seize an opportunity that comes rarely, and compel change and growth, development and order?

 Mulayam Singhs coalition partners are beginning to abandon ship and drift towards those parties they feel may have a chance to pull the votes. They are all desperately yearning to hang on to power and survive the potential churning that may well expel them from the pot of UP politics. It is at this vulnerable juncture that the diehard, old and predictable players need to be eased out and replaced by the inexperienced young, energetic leaders who are not carrying the baggage of failed political postures. They should grab the moment and run to the post. It is imperative to start on a clean slate, without the preparedness, because that alone will generate new ideas, methodologies and mechanism for sane, inclusive, secular governance. 

 This is the right time to sow fresh seeds, sprinkle the manure, nurture them so that they germinate in the hitherto fallow, degraded lands. The next decade should be dedicated to the next generation. Will the result of the election salute young India, or will we continue to be stuck in the prevailing rut, sinking deeper into the mire for some while longer?

 THINGS FALL APART AT MIDDAY

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 Commuting through Jadavpur can shorten your life

 At 12 noon every working day, I curse my forefathers for having had anything to do with Calcutta. This midday epiphany occurs at the crossroads (conveniently called 8B ) near the Jadavpur bus terminus, along the lines of an eccentric fellow passenger on a train, once, who had suddenly expressed his desire to run a train over squatters who organize rail-rokos. 

 Mine eyes dazzle (and my nerves fail me) everyday. At 12 noon, Jadavpur embodies everything ugly and bad and life-threatening in Calcutta. If 8B is hell, then the road to hell is Jadavpur Station Road. Station roads in Calcutta suburbs are pandemonium everywhere. But the JSR boasts certain salient features it serves a station that is the gateway to the city for many daily wage-earners, shophands, labourers, masons, small traders, clerks and babus. More importantly, Jadavpur, along with Dhakuria and Ballygunge, is one of the three stations that supply south Calcutta with its maids. 

 Anytime within twenty minutes before or after a trains departure, one can be knocked down by a gang of the above-mentioned, running towards or away from the station. If you take a rickshaw, you hold on to the apology for a seat for dear life, lest the rickshaw hit another or is hit by a truck or simply rams into ten running men and women and sends you flying into your maids lap. All the while, as you are busy surviving till 8B, your ears are captive to a great proletarian symphony of rickshaw horns, bicycle bells, vendors screams, maids cries, pedestrians protests at being hit by anything on wheels, university students loud cackle and the rickshaw pullers repertoire of abuse as he dodges everything other than his rickshaw.

 At the entrance to the Jadavpur subway, you disembark and invoke Hercules to help you cross the road. Why you cant, as a rule, use the same subway Ill explain in a while. 

 Chased by the proletariat, you end up in the hands of the bourgeoisie. You see them running about everywhere hopping onto buses that stop wherever they want to, missing your feet or your torso by inches; you find them blocking your path at the very point you finally decide to cross the road; and they invariably wait for you to bounce off their paunches at the other side. 8B is a world turned upside down. The meagre hint of traffic rules that binds your journey till Jadavpur thana disappears once youve passed into the jurisdiction of the West Bengal Police. The ensuing traffic jams as well as every bus- and auto-drivers rash-driving genes make you lose five years of your life every time you travel up to 8B or beyond. 

 Could there be any further to go down hell? There is if you need to cross S.C. Mullick Road to take an auto-rickshaw to the Tollygunge metro station or Ranikuthi or to use the market. The pavement belongs to hawkers and pedestrians flabbier than you, the last often young Bengali mothers who never have enough of over-feeding their fat kids at the fast-food shops. 

 So you stick to the road and nearly get mauled by hoodlums or salesmen on their bikes. (Twice I missed rusted rickshaw mudguards digging into my skin.) By the time you arrive at one of the eateries, your appetite has left you and you curse yourself for not staying at home. But if you take that auto to the metro station on your way to work, god help you live to travel again through a locality called Bikramgarh that lies between Jadavpur and Golf Gardens. Actual and potential accidents as one daily hurtles down towards Deshapran Sashmal Road can turn one into a violent psychopath.

 So why cant you take that subway? You may use it once and pat yourself on the back for being a responsible and sensible citizen. But into your third straight day down there, your knees will give way and in summer you will drown in your sweat before you are halfway up again. The subway is the haunt of lazy cows (and bulls) that make the place stink like a circus loo round the year. You need to navigate your steps through couples sitting on the stairway holding hands, etc. and you have to ignore catcalls from thuggish young men as you emerge at the other end; perhaps they suppose there is something macho about skirting the approaching wheels of mini-buses as you cross the road. And, of course, the subway is not very safe after 9 pm. 

 Using the subway might make one forget how bad it is up there. And the subway shouldnt be an excuse for utter administrative and civic failure. The only thing a concerned citizen can do is take the 8B pain everyday and hate it enough to speak up sometime, somewhere or turn into a beast and contemplate running trains over those that perpetuate the Calcutta chaos.

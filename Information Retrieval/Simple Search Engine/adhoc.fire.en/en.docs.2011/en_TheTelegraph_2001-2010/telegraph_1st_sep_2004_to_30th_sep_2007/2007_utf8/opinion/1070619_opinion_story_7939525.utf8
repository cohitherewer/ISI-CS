The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THE DEAD CANT SPEAK, THE REST CAN BE PAID

 Sunita Sau was found hanging from a pipe on the roof of a tall building in Bhowanipore, Calcutta. She was about 17, and had been working for seven months as domestic help in one of the apartments there. The police said firmly that it was a case of suicide, even before the post-mortem. Her father, however, alleged that she had been killed. A case would have been lodged. At the last moment, the employers settled with a payment of Rs 1.5 lakh to Sunitas family. 

 When a girl dies under mysterious circumstances in her employers home, events take on certain predictable patterns. If the parents are alive and within reach, the death is a bargaining chip. Money changes hands when threats do not suffice. Sunitas sister turned away the concerned NGO, saying, Whats the point of a case? Who will look after my father when he is old?

When there are no parents on the horizon, the police know which pattern to seize upon. There are so many alleged suicides, yet not a single abettor. Eleven-year-old Dipa Bagchi was brought to work in Calcutta from Bangaldesh by her cousin. When she was found burnt to death in her employers home, he was contacted. He soon melted away. There was no follow-up. 

 To believe that every girl who dies in her employers house has committed suicide is to raise other questions. The numbers are startling enough. So is there a reason to inquire into the reasons of suicides in this one segment? These children do not go to school, they are prevented from playing, they have to slave away at heavy physical tasks when that is against the law. They are made visible only through death or extraordinary torture. But their visibility also means the blatant exposure of critical lapses in the system that should be protecting them. Pure misery may kill, although it is difficult to believe that it kills in such numbers.

 The law against child labour is useless without the will to plug the loopholes in the systems that surround the existence of a poor mans child. When Shikha Naskar was rescued from her employers home, she accused her employer of having sexually molested her. She was 12, but she knew what she was talking about, for she had seen more of the same in her earlier places of work. But her family refused to file a case. It would be difficult to get her married, her father said. 

 In 2006, 16-year-old Manashi Haldar was beaten up, bound and gagged and locked in the bathroom. She, again, accused her employers in no uncertain terms. Soon after, her father dismissed her daughters charge as a misunderstanding. There was no question of Manashis security or self-esteem. A pay-off, and her job, were more important.

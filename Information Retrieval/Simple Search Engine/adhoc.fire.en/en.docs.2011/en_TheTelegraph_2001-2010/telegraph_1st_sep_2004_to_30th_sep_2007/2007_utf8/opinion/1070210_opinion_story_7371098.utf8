The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TWO GRAND SPECTACLES

 This above all 

 Khushwant Singh

 Proud display

 Two programmes I never miss watching on TV are the Republic Day parade down the Rajpath and Beating the Retreat at Vijay Chowk, three days later. They have been getting better and better; this year they were the best ever. I dont know who the people responsible for the bandobast were, but they deserve hearty pats on their backs Shaabash! Well done!

 I have seen military tattoos in England, including one outside Edinburgh Castle, where Sikh bagpipers led the march; I have seen Bastille Day parade down Champs-lyses, led by cadets of St. Cyr Academy, and Israels Independence Day parade in Beersheva and many others in Washington, Moscow and Beijing on TV. But take it from me, our boys do a better job than any of them.

 There is a childish joy seeing men decked in colourful uniforms of khaki, red, blue and black, chests ablaze with medals, swinging their arms in unison and marching in step to the playing of bands. In the spectacular display of martial splendour, our president and prime minister look oddly out of place. We cant do anything about their physical stature but since their presence is a must, it would not be too bad an idea to persuade them to wear uniforms of some kind on these two events. No joking!

 Of the two spectacles, I prefer watching Beating the Retreat. The Republic Day parade takes up all the morning and there is a lot of coming and going of VIPs, preliminary rituals, banging away of canons and endless succession of floats of different states which I find somewhat tedious. On the other hand, the Retreat is compact and over in an hour. It has no boring interludes; it is a succession of bands, non-stop martial music till the tri-colour is lowered. And as the sun goes behind Rashtrapati Bhavan, bands march uphill through arches of the necks of caparisoned camels, playing Allama Iqbals Saarey jahaan sey achha, Hindustan hamaara. Thousands of bulbs are switched on, lighting the secretariats and the presidential palaces. Bapus favourite hymn, Abide with me, rings out in melancholy notes. He might have disapproved of the display of military might along Rajpath, but he would have certainly enjoyed Beating the Retreat, if for no other reason than the fact that here are soldiers in uniforms not carrying guns but bugles, bagpipes, trombones, flutes, cymbals and drums.

 Traces of the traceless

 This is going to be the year of Dervesh Jelaluddin Rumi. He was born 800 years ago on September 30, 1207. Preparations are afoot to celebrate his birth anniversary on a world-wide scale. I understand our government has earmarked a tidy sum for the purpose. I do not know how birth anniversaries of scholars, poets and saintly personalities can be celebrated besides bringing their writings and messages to the common people. Rumi wrote in Persian. Most of his Mathnavi is available in English translation. Much of it is obscure and esoteric. I am not aware of its being translated into any Indian language. But I have reason to believe that most of our celebrated poets read him in the original. One of Ghalibs couplets, Baazeechai atfaal hai duniya meyrey aagey, is lifted straight from the Mathnavi.

 Rumi also set up the Dervesh Order in Koyna (Turkey), where he lived most of his life and died on December 17, 1273. His disciples continue to dance the way he did dressed in long red fez caps and black tassels, flowing white skirts pirouetting round and round in endless circles to the beat of the drums and melancholy notes of flutes. It is spectacular. I expect our organizers or the Turkish embassy in Delhi will get a party of dancing dervishes and take them on a Bharat Darshan tour. Maybe the Afghan embassy will also pitch in as Jelaluddin was born in Balkh (Afghanistan) and initially known as Jelaluddin Balkhi. To avoid Mongol depredations, he migrated to Koyna (then under Roman domination, hence the suffix Rumi) when he was ten years old. He was meant to follow his fathers calling of being the Shaikh of his community and did so till he was in his thirties. Then he met Sufi Shams Tabrizi. It was a dramatic turnabout in his life. He turned Sufi and poetry burst out of him like lava out of a volcano.

 Rumis poetry is a strange amalgam of the divine and the earthy. He wrote about the love of god, Jesus, Prophet Mohammed, Hazrat Ali and Sufi saints; he also versified anecdotes of sexual exploits, women copulating with donkeys, wolves and donkeys farting, men and women defecating in the open. Nevertheless, some of it are gems of purest ray. He had an open mind.

 All day I think about it, then at night

 I say it

 Where did I come from, and what am 

 I supposed to be doing?

 I have no idea;

 My soul is from elsewhere, I am sure 

 of that,

 And I intend to end up there.

 (All translations by Barks amp; Moyne)

 Rumi did not value book learning. He said:

 Knowledge that is acquired

 is not like this. Those who have it 

 worry if

 audiences like it or not

 Its a bait for popularity.

 He extolled poverty. What you own can vanish; its only a dream, a vanity, breath through a moustache, he wrote.

 What really makes a difference is love in practice. He wrote:

 If anyone wonders how Jesus 

 raised the dead,

 dont try to explain the miracle.

 Kiss me on the lips.

 Like this, like this.

 When Rumi died on December 17, 1273 he told his disciples:

 Not Christian or Jew or Muslim, not 

 Hindu,

 Buddhist, sufi, or zen. Not any 

 religion

 or cultural system, I am not from the 

 East

 or the West, not out of the ocean or 

 up

 from the ground, not natural or 

 ethereal, not

 composed of elements at all. I do not 

 exist,

 am not an entity in this world or the 

 next,

 did not descend from Adam and Eve 

 or any

 origin story. My place is placeless, a 

 trace

 of the traceless. Neither body or 

 soul.

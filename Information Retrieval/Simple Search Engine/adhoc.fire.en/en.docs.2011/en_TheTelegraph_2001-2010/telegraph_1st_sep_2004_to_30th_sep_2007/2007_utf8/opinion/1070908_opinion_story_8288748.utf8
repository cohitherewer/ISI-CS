 OTHER PEOPLES FOIBLES

 This Above All - 

Khushwant Singh

 Nothing to laugh about

 As you get old, there is little left to laugh about. Nothing seems to work properly anymore. You cannot read much, and the television screen looks blurred. You need hearing aids, and you need to ask people to speak loudly so that you can hear what they are saying. Your feet grow unsteady and you become scared of falling and breaking your hipbone. You have to go on a bland diet because everything you relished in your younger days no longer agrees with you. You lose your independence and become a burden to your family. 

 Under such circumstances, laughter fights a losing battle. Nor does the news cheer you up. Every morning, after I finish reading half-a-dozen papers, I recall T.N. Seshans answer to my question, Seshan, dont you ever laugh? He had growled, What is there to laugh about! Indeed is there anything left to laugh about? The answer is, Yes, if you have a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at other peoples foibles, as well as at yourself. You will find lots of things about people which are comic, funny and will provoke bellyfuls of laughter. Try it out; it will be good for your health.

 Start with would-be politicians. They lead processions, yell slogans with their mouths wide open and wave fists or swords in the air. Ask them gently, sotto voce, Beta! Itna gussa kyon kartey ho ? (Son, why are you so angry?) Then, go on to politicians who have made good and become members of Vidhan Sabhas, Rajya Sabha or Lok Sabha. Switch on your television at question hour and watch the tamasha you will see how they go at each other, how they swarm down the well of the House, and how they force speakers to adjourn proceedings day after day. 

 But do not lose your cool and shout back, You fellows are wasting public money, mine and my neighbours. Let the media do that. Do not even repeat what our ambassador to the United States of America called them: headless chicken. Instead, address them calmly over the screen and say, Bhai sahib, kyon itney khafaa ho gaye? (Brother why are you so angry?) The ambassador apologized for calling you headless chicken. It would have been more appropriate if he had used the term brainless or chicken-brained. That is what Somnath Chatterjee often indicates when he orders some of you out of the House. Many thanks for making yourselves a laughing stock.

 Younger people use many offensive epithets for oldies of my age old fogeys, codgers, old farts, fuddy-duddies, old geysers and much else. But I do not give a damn since I count myself among the Opals (old persons with active lifestyles). 

 An American wordsmith has coined a word for it: elderhumour. She says, Now that we have passed the earnestness of youth and the acquisition years, when we took ourselves much too seriously, we are convinced that two things are absolutely essential in order to face the adventure of growing old: a healthy spontaneity and a quick, robust sense of humour. In fact, humour can be a sign of spiritual well-being.

 A time to enrich ones mind

 I am an old man but not yet bent double with age. I have always had a little stoop; it is no worse than when I was a young man. I know many men and women much younger than I am who bend their torsos while walking, as if they were looking for something they had dropped on the ground. They remind me of the lines of an Urdu poet whose name I cannot recall:

 Jawanee jaatee rahee

 Aur hamein pataa bhee na chalaa;

 Issee ko dhoondh rahey hain

 Qamar jhukai hooey

 (I lost my youth

 I did not realise that was my trouble

 It is my youth I keep looking for

 With my body bent double)

 The quest for the lost youth can be very frustrating. Once gone, it is gone for ever. Old people who try to act young end up making fools of themselves. When they make passes at girls the age of their granddaughter, they are likely to be reminded of their age by being called dadaji or nanaji. One word is more than enough to deflate their libidos. You cannot prevent the body from decaying, but you can slow down the pace of decay by watching your diet, and by taking gentle exercise and medication. There is no reason why you should not be able to live a hundred years in reasonably good health.

 The one redeeming feature of ageing is that it gives you more time to enrich your mind. It need not be limited to reading books and journals; it can, and should, extend to watching natural phenomena and human behaviour. It will help develop new facets of your personality and people, old and young, will flock around you. The most important way to develop your mind and personality is to question the validity of everything taken for granted and to formulate your own answers. That is why I reject blind faith and religious beliefs they dampen the spirit of enquiry and prevent a person from developing. I find it difficult to keep up a meaningful dialogue with religious people and tend to dismiss them as mentally retarded.

 The noisy drummer

 Ever since Fernandes ceased to be

 defence minister

 He became a noisy drummer!

 Being in the wilderness for long

 From insomnia did he suffer.

 Frustration is a deadly disease 

 It turns an intelligent person into a

 duffer 

 How sad! In a fit of frenzy 

 This political turncoat called PM a

 bluffer!

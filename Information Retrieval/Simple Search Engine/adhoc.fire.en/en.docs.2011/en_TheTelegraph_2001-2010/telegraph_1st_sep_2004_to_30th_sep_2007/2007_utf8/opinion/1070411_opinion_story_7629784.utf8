 DIFFERENT LIVES

 Why is it that, in India, suffering is officially acknowledged only when it is presented as statistics? Nothing that the big, new national survey has revealed about the lives of children will surprise those who have been working with them for any length of time, and have been trying in vain to get certain aspects of their experience across to the relevant authorities. So the gasps of ministerial outrage, especially those emanating from the ministry of women and child development, sound nothing short of absurd now. They reveal the lack of any sense of the longstanding magnitude of the problem, especially in those who have been entrusted to address it. The real problem is a willed, adult blindness. This is partly a survival mechanism, the perennial solution to not being able to bear too much reality. But it is also an absolute inability to imagine, and therefore understand and tackle, what human lives outside urban, middle-class respectability are actually like. 

 Indias power elite, be they politicians, legislators or policy-makers, are more-or-less clueless about how the children whom they delegate others to survey get exploited and abused in the specific circumstances of their different lives. There is one set of blindnesses and myths regarding the lives of children from the familiar classes. And there is another kind of blindness produced by the indifference and ignorance that come from social distance regarding the lives of the urban and rural poor. Government schools, shelter homes and the many workplaces in which children labour form a terrain that remains uncharted in quite a different way from more affluent or respectable spaces like family homes and classrooms, where too childrens lives could be dangerously invisible at many unimaginable levels. Moreover, the perception of both these terrains remains obscured by cherished myths and evasions regarding childhood especially its relationships with poverty and power, work and sex. An unwillingness to visualize childhoods in the plural, unexamined notions about who or what is good for children, and an inability to see a childs life as governed by larger social, economic and regional realities characterize the laws and policies that try to improve juvenile existence in India. Yet, what such a survey also proves is how willing, and able, children are to answer the most painful or terrifying questions about their lives. But who, if any, asks them, or what is done with the answers, is seldom in their own hands.

 LESSONS ON THE ROAD

 Malvika Singh

 Travelling in India invigorates the mind, excites the imagination, generates new ideas and aspirations and gives one the space to dream about a future that could be very different from the one we seem to be heading towards. Meeting men and women who live in remote areas of the subcontinent is always reassuring. These people have been exposed to the modern world but have chosen to remain anchored in their special culture. They are proud of their legacy and are committed to restore and conserve what is best in their traditions. It is this community of people across India that binds together the many facets of this land, nurturing them through the contortions and many churnings.

 Meeting such individuals is what gives a different and memorable dimension to a trip. It is this that separates travel from tourism. Connectivity with the realities of India happens through such encounters and that is when myths about places and cultures, created by alien centres of power, begin to get unravelled, revealing strange and unnecessary biases. Such distortions often lead to social and political misunderstandings, which, in turn, lead to isolation and, over time, to reassertions that are never accepted or comprehended by those who initiate policies without any real sense of the complex cultural truths. This inability to hear, listen, trust and respect a view that is expressed out of the box leads to polarization and social unease, creating factions that tend to fragment society.

 Pulling strings 

 If the concerned authorities respected and endorsed diversity, and if the many communities believed that governance was equal for all, the emergent unity would be formidable and India would be a state to reckon with. But, true to form, weak, insecure and demotivated political leaders have perceived diversity as something that can be exploited and used to divide rather than cement the rare pluralism that is the essence of India.

 To play majority versus minority, and rich versus poor, is cruel and inhuman. It is a political prop, used excessively and ruthlessly by all parties and this practice needs to be done away with as it allows the worst to prevail over the best. We have all been victims of this truth. We all know well how ordinary people are exploited, insulted and ill-treated by those who assume they have the right to determine our lives because they represent the state. These babus are deft manipulators and are masters at interpreting the law incorrectly to suit an arrangement that keeps them entrenched in power. They are always eager to manipulate political representatives who have scant knowledge about their allocated portfolios as well as the many aspects of ministerial operation. This is where the manipulation takes place. This is where governance becomes a deadly tool in the hands of status quoists with zero commitment to change. This is because a change will expose their intellectual lethargy and their functional complacency.

 If only the Indian bureaucrats were truly dedicated to the cadre they belong to, and were proud of the responsibility they have been given, this country could be charged up to forge a partnership with the government to bring rapid change. 

 Many families living in the hundreds of small towns have been actively involved in working with and influencing their communities. Their children and relatives have been out into the big bad world and have returned with new ideas and experiences. If these families were brought into the action plan for change and development as representatives of society and culture, a movement forward would take place. 

 Such a movement would check and balance the lazy bureaucrat, forge a new spirit, compel accountability and put Bharat on track.

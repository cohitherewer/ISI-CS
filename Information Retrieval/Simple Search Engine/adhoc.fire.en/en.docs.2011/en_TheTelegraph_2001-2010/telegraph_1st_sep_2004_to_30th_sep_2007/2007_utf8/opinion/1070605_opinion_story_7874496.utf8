 SCARED BY 

 THE SILENCE 

 MALAFIDE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Silence 

 is always scary and spells confusion. It endorses the perception 

 that a silent leadership, not engaged in committed dialogue 

 with all those pulling in different directions on endless 

 complicated issues that face us today, is not able to rise 

 above the petty political considerations and lacks a fundamental 

 commitment to the cause. The sense one gets is that the 

 leadership is not in control. To be in control it is necessary 

 that the leader believes in the policy and in its effective 

 administration. Chaos ensues when that is not the case and 

 the average citizen can see that very clearly. Unfortunately, 

 when a regime crosses the three-year mark and is expected 

 to internally assess its policies and performance, it begins 

 to be overwhelmed by a sense of denial, which compels it 

 to insulate itself from reality. I used to think that the 

 coalition of the United Progressive Alliance would be different, 

 would set down a new idiom of political functioning and 

 would restructure the operation of government. But it was 

 not to be. 

 There was a time when national 

 leaders felt that it was their responsibility to quell social 

 disturbances and restore stability and peace. They would 

 leap into the fray, come together, thrash out issues and 

 get the situation under control. They would not hide in 

 protected enclaves. They were democrats. Jawaharlal Nehru 

 believed he was the ruler of India and dispensed his judgment 

 on all national issues. Indira Gandhi did the same. Sadly, 

 this new kind of politics, where you allow the situation 

 to deteriorate so that it can adversely affect an opposing 

 political party, is, in my book, anti-national.

 What happened?

 The civil war that has erupted 

 in Rajasthan and the National Capital Region is a direct 

 result of failed electoral promises based on potentially 

 volatile issues that have come home to roost. All parties 

 are responsible and all parties, bar none, have misused 

 the less privileged Indian for their personal victories. 

 Ashok Gehlot, who failed to rule Rajasthan effectively or 

 keep corruption at bay despite being clean himself, made 

 all the predictable noises as we saw this dreadful, mad 

 violence escalate noises that have not been able to extricate 

 us from the unravelling horrors. In contrast, Sachin Pilot 

 was out there in the field, speaking a matter-of-fact language, 

 making a plea for sanity, not running scared of addressing 

 the mob, because he sees them as frustrated, exploited 

 citizens with unfulfilled demands.

 Why was Gehlot not in Dausa or 

 in Sawai Madhopur? Where was the chief minister and members 

 of her cabinet? Where was the man who has relentlessly aggravated 

 and added fire to his divisive caste-agenda? That senior 

 leader has not able to step out of his age and time even 

 though the world around him has radically changed, thereby 

 making a political dinosaur out of him. He should have been 

 at the scene of the crime in a wheelchair, appeasing the 

 mob that he has created. Why has he gone behind the purdah?

 I am curious. Why didnt the prime 

 minister deviate from the sinister norm of silence, particularly 

 since he is not a typical politician with a small constituency 

 but an a-political person with the entire country as his 

 constituency? He could have forced an all-party emergency 

 meet with chief ministers and top leaders to arrive at a 

 fresh solution. Why did he not address the people using 

 the communication tool of the government Doordarshan 

 and make a fervent plea, on day one, for peace, calm and 

 sanity? Surely it is he who can muster a consensus and diffuse 

 the ridiculous and small-minded partisan positions? He should 

 have been advised to step forward, out of the seeming rot 

 and mire, to engage with India and make a positive impact 

 at a time when the UPA is beginning to lose ground with 

 rising anarchy and divisiveness.

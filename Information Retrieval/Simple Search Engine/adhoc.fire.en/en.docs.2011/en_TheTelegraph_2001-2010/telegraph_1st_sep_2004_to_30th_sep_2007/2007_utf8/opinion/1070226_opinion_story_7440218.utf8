 BLANK FIRE

 The Bofors gun continues to smoke. The sudden appearance and detention of Mr Ottavio Quattrocchi in Argentina has rekindled interest and speculation about the cause clbre that caused the downfall of Rajiv Gandhi. Mr Quattrocchi is the last remaining accused in the celebrated case and has been eluding the Central Bureau of Investigation for a very very long time. However, it is not the time taken to track him down that is inexplicable. What is mystifying is the fact that while Mr Quattrocchi was taken into custody by the Argentinian authorities on February 6, the news of his detention did not break in India till February 23. It is difficult to believe that the CBI did not report the detention to the prime minister and the government. So what took the CBI and the government more than a fortnight to issue an announcement? It is clear that the CBI has cut it rather fine since it has till March 5 one month from the date of detention to move court in Argentina to seek the custody of Mr Quattrocchi. The pace at which the CBI has moved so far in the matter does not exactly suggest enthusiasm.

 One reason why the government has probably dragged its feet is the larger-than-reality impact the Bofors affair has on Indian politics. For the Congress, always prickly about Bofors for reasons best known only to itself, Mr Quattrocchis detention could not have come at a worse time. The budget session in Parliament began on Friday and elections in Uttar Pradesh have been announced for April. The re-emergence of the Bofors matter and the usual ado it invariably creates will deflect the attention of the Lok Sabha from critical matters pertaining to the economy and reforms. There will be more hot air and less discussion. In the UP elections, where the Congress is up for the consolation prize, the Bofors scandal will further hurt its prospects. Its rivals will use the issue to start a vile and insidious whispering campaign directed against the Congress president. What is ironic is that by going on the backfoot, the government has only aggravated the situation and aroused suspicion. Mr Quattrocchi may or may not be guilty as charged. This should be no reason for the government to abandon its commitment to transparency by offering silly excuses. It could be argued that Bofors is a dead case. By its ham-handed handling of Mr Quattrocchis detention, the government may have shot the Congress in its foot by the Bofors gun.

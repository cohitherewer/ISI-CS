 SEARCH FOR A NEW FACE 

 BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH

 Having ruined the forests and tribal bill, Brinda Karat has now taken up the responsibility to spell disaster for education. If media reports are anything to go by, Rahul Gandhis altercation with Karat brought to light the divide between two generations one energetic, the other stuck in some unimaginable time warp. Karat and her generation want to incorporate a strange doctrine into what is otherwise an open and creative learning process, thereby discouraging differences in opinion. This horror of you-do-it-my-way-or- else (we will pull the rug) smacks of treacherous coalition politics that is devoid of open-minded discussion in keeping with a changing world. 

 This shows up, yet again, how the Left resorts to blackmailing the government whenever it feels that its stale ideology is being compromised. If only these politicians would realize that demands such as an egalitarian distribution of wealth and services, dignity in public life and suchlike cannot be the private preserve of the Left. Everyone believes in an equal life and the spokespersons of the various communist parties better begin to recognize this truth.

 On social and economic issues, all political parties profess to want to bring equality of opportunity into play, promising similar growth patterns and future prosperity. None delivers the goods as they should and even that rare, competent leadership which rears its head every now and again, finds excuses to absolve an increasingly weak and malleable administration from failure. This inability of the top leadership to call a spade a spade, hire the best and fire corrupt officials, and expedite the process of change and development has resulted in an archaic, exclusive system that has stifled creativity and fresh ideas.

 Time to change

 It is time for the next generation to demand the reins, to leap into the deep end and find ways to realize collective goals. An individuals creativity and energy peaks by forty years at the latest. By the time he is sixty years of age, he is expected to take the kamandalu and move off, hopefully to recharge his mind and soul. 

 The fact is that Indian leaders love their life of comfort. They are selfish and greedy, and stick to their chairs and their failed rhetoric. They are responsible for forcing the nation to remain a Fourth World country, even though Indian citizens have extraordinary entrepreneurial skills, enormous patience, acute intelligence and overwhelming survival instincts. 

 Despite the exploitation carried out by British colonizers, the inherent ability of Indians to deal with social horrors is truly remarkable. It is these diverse strengths of the people and their iron will that need to be encouraged for the sake of development. Instead, we have scheming politicians and a corrupt administration that conspire to pull down and defeat all initiative and endeavour.

 We need a coup to be led by the young regardless of their experience, because we have seen that the experienced in India resist change and only follow the status quo and ideas that have all failed. In other words, less privileged Indians have taught to let sleeping dogs lie. 

 A recent news report quoted the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, saying that the time has come to move into the capitalist mode, accelerate industrialization, create new job opportunities, and try and ensure that the negative effects of the communist ideology do not drown the positives. 

 It certainly makes sense to tailor the structuring of the free market to become more inclusive. However, it must be remembered that to achieve this, one would require a sharp and fine intellect. More importantly, this would necessitate a change of guard in the politburo. Brinda Karat needs to give way.

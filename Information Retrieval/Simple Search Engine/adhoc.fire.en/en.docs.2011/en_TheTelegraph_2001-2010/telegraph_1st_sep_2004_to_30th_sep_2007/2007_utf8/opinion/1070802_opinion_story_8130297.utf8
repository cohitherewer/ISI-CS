 HANEEFS STORY 

 Somak Ghoshal

 FIFTH COLUMN

 After several suspenseful weeks, 

 the Australian government has finally come up with the first 

 piece of evidence against Mohammed Haneef. The immigration 

 minister, Kevin Andrews, has claimed that Haneefs online 

 chat with his brother, Mohammed Shoaib, substantiates his 

 alleged involvement in the failed Glasgow attacks. Characteristically, 

 the Australian authorities have released only selected bits 

 from the protected material. But the extracts do hold 

 together, suggesting just the right mix of secretiveness 

 and sinister cunning that would make Haneef appear suspicious.

 And this evidence is considered 

 good enough to establish the credibility of the investigations 

 the details of which have been guarded so as not to prejudice 

 the course of justice. After two terrible slips early on 

 in this case, the Australians ought to tread softly on this 

 word. First, there was the SIM-card theory: the card had 

 once belonged to Haneef when he lived in the UK, and it 

 was found on the burning jeep that Haneefs cousin, Sabeel 

 Ahmed, had driven into the airport building. It emerged, 

 much later, that it had been found a couple of hours after 

 this attack in an apartment away from the airport. 

 Then there was Haneefs diary, 

 with the names of the UK suspects, which turned out to be 

 another false alarm. There was speculation that the police 

 had tampered with it, until Haneef admitted that he had 

 copied out the address of his cousins (the suspects), whom 

 he had visited in the UK a few years ago.

 Fill in the blanks

 So, it was largely on the basis 

 of his online chat with his brother in India that Haneef 

 was detained, put in solitary confinement for several days, 

 and questioned for nearly four weeks. All this while, the 

 course of investigation seemed to be overriding the course 

 of justice. Andrews and the Australian police declared that 

 the decision to cancel Haneefs visa had been made on the 

 basis of information not provided to the court. Once his 

 visa was cancelled, Haneef was expected to remove himself 

 from the country. Haneef was not being formally deported, 

 but circumstances demanded that he must give up his job 

 and go back home. His employers, conscientious as they are, 

 even promised to take him back if he ever managed to clear 

 the red tape. True, there was no mention of deportation, 

 but the imagination can fill in the blanks left by bureaucratic 

 and diplomatic quibbling.

 In the wake of the Glasgow attacks, 

 Manmohan Singh had urged Gordon Brown to prevent racial 

 profiling in the name of fighting terrorism. Having said 

 that, political intervention, on Indias part, became rather 

 subdued. There was hardly any interest in Haneefs fate. 

 Apart from a few human rights activists and concerned citizens, 

 did the political classes worry about how much of a person 

 a suspected terrorist like Haneef remained? Where did 

 he belong in the scheme of the welfare state? What were 

 his legal, social and political coordinates? How much of 

 the right to dignity was left for him?

 Questions that go beyond the here 

 and now are, expectedly, dispensable. The boy is back home, 

 cleared of suspicions. The Australian prime minister has 

 declared that his government would not apologize to Haneef 

 because he was not victimized and Australias international 

 reputation has not been harmed by this misstart to its new 

 anti-terrorism laws.

 The arrogance of this statement 

 does not disturb the Indian political establishment. And 

 why should it? After all, India has just narrowly escaped 

 the ill-repute of one of its citizens, and that too a Muslim, 

 being implicated in global terrorism. So long as the secular, 

 peace-loving (Haneefs own words) and democratic international 

 image of India remains protected, the dignity of a few unfortunate 

 men and the trauma of their families are of much less moment.

 SAD REFLECTION

 In a democracy over and above legality there is the matter of standards of public life. These standards are often not written down in the law book or the Constitution. They emerge out of conventions and the conscience of those who are supposed to establish the norms. There is nothing in the Constitution that prevents the prime minister from being elected to the Rajya Sabha. But adherence to the conventions of democracy and the highest standards of public life dictate that the prime minister should be a member of the lower house, the house of the people. A prime minister of India cannot expect to lead the people of India unless he is elected by the people of India. While there is nothing legally or constitutionally wrong about a prime minister sitting in the upper house, there is something morally anomalous about it. Manmohan Singh, when he became prime minister, was not a member of the Lok Sabha. But he had the opportunity of getting himself elec- ted to the lower house within a few months of his assuming office. Mr Singh did not do so. Another opportunity has now presented itself. Mr Singhs term in the Rajya Sabha comes to an end on June 14, but before that date he will seek re-election to the upper house on May 24. He will be the first prime minister to seek re-election to the Rajya Sabha to ensure that he continues to retain the top job.

 By opting to continue in the Rajya Sabha, Mr Singh is setting a bad precedent. This by itself is sad and unbecoming of him. What is worse is that, given Mr Singhs educational background and his reputation as a man of the highest integrity, he should be an example to those legislators who are new entrants and therefore unfamiliar with the practices and conventions of democracy. It needs to be pointed out also that Mr Singh has little or nothing to do with Assam from where he is seeking re-election. His address there is a token one. Indeed, to legalize this kind of tokenism, the residence clause was removed for election to the Rajya Sabha. This made a mockery of the notion of the Council of States as envisioned in the Constitution. Mr Singh has done nothing that is illegal. But as an upholder of the highest standards of public life can Mr Singh look at himself in the mirror when he ties his turban every morning? Perhaps the man Mr Singh averts his own eyes from the reflection of the politician Mr Singh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FOR OUR EYES ONLY

 PARIMAL BHATTACHARYA

 While Singur marks an important chapter in the recent political history of West Bengal, there has been a number of interesting and rather unprecedented sideshows to the main drama. Take the exhibition of smashed furniture put up by the state government inside the assembly. People lined up to watch the handiwork of irate opposition members. On Christmas day, a similar crowd gathered at the venue of Mamata Banerjees hunger strike. If the exhibition at the assembly can be compared to a postmodern art installation, the hunger strike venue had all the props of a roadshow: a proper stage with a curtain, a billboard showing the countdown of days, a copy of the Constitution and so on. 

 Welcome to the world of tableaux politics. One need not come out on the streets to savour it. There are now dedicated television channels to bring home the live coverage.

 In fact, the visual image began to dominate the political scene in India since 24-hour news channels came into being. This coincided with the emergence of coalition politics, which needed a live public forum for political parties to share common interests and thrash out differences. What better forum can there be than television? On a number of occasions over the past decade, pre- and post-poll alliances have been forged at television studios rather than at party offices. This has also seen the emergence of a breed of articulate, media-savvy politicians. 

 Visual media has influenced the political scene in other ways too. In the Singur dispute, for example, we have seen a lot of the heat generated and channelized by live television coverage. The visibility factor was so important here that the epicentre of the agitation shifted to Calcutta. For weeks, people saw protest rallies and dharnas on the citys streets, some of them taking novel visual forms procession of bare-bodied men or women carrying pitchers.

 Visual splendour

 We live in a technology-aided, image-driven society. From the graphic icons on electronic gadgets and computer screens to giant cutouts and billboards dominating the cityscape, visual image is the king. And the political parties realize this. Perhaps that is the reason why the same government which introduced a bill to abolish hand-pulled rickshaws to make the city appear more humane, also introduced another bill to allow political graffiti on the wall. Such puzzling contradictions often bear a stark reminder: the city has a large illiterate workforce and to reach out to them one has no option but to grab their eyeballs.

 For the educated and affluent, there are always newer models of mobile phones with larger LCD screens which allow for SMS polls undertaken by the media. This gives the passive voyeur a feeling of being transformed into an active participant. Whether that sense of participation is illusory or not is open to question. One may ask if the kind of exhibitionist politics we saw lately brings into focus or clouds the issues at stake.

 The visual image has certain documentary limitations. Most important, it can show an event in stark detail, but it cannot show the processes that lead to that event. Thus, while the picture of a starving human can speak much more than miles of statistics, it can hardly capture the patterns of slow malnutrition stalking the countryside. The footage of policemen beating up farmers can galvanize a society, but no visual image can be made of the fears and hopes of an agrarian community about to step into an industrial zone. In spite of the extensive visual coverage and the bizarre forms of tableaux politics, real, hard information on the Singur issue has been painfully lacking. While the government and the opposition wrestled, none thought of posting their data on the net or publishing it. Seeing, it seems, is not always believing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SADDEST DAY, HAPPIEST DAY

 This above all - Khushwant Singh

 Seasons wishes

 A Welsh psychologist, Cliff Arnall, has come to the conclusion that January 24 is the saddest day of the year. I read about it in an article by C.J. Moore in the International Herald Tribune. The reasons listed by Arnall for arriving at a precise date, going by the depth of gloom, sound specious and only apply to regions lying above the tropic of cancer where the winters are long and harsh. The period begins with the winter solstice (December 21-22), when we in the northern hemisphere have the longest night and the shortest day. This is not so in the southern hemisphere, comprising South America, most of Africa, Australia, New Zealand and many islands: there it is the other way round the longest day and the shortest night. No provocation to take a gloomy view of life.

 Long, cold winter months do indeed dampen human spirits. It has been named Seasonal Affective Disorder. More old people kick the bucket during this time than others. People try to keep their spirits high by lighting log fires in their homes, celebrating Christmas and New Year by partying, extra drinking, exchanging presents, singing and dancing. Then comes the hangover. Heavy consumption of liquor, money thrown away in buying presents, and after-party fatigue take their toll; Everyone is in the dumps; its the Celtic gloom, in Irish, tha mi bron ach the sadness is upon me. Arnall may be near the mark in fixing January 24 as the saddest day of the year. To me it sounds nonsensical. In any case, it does not apply to India. We too have a spell of biting cold after the winter solstice. But with us, it is also the wedding season; so there is a lot of jollity. It also coincides with rehearsals for the Republic Day parade. Bands start practice at 6 a.m. and go on till sunrise. Schoolchildren and soldiers march down Rajpath. Thousands gather along the route to watch and cheer them. At nights, public buildings are lit up: it looks like one mammoth national wedding.

 If there is the saddest day of the year, it stands to reason that there should also be a happiest day of the year. In Europe and North America, I expect it would be some time in the month of May when woods are green, flowers bloom, thrushes, black birds and nightingales are in full-throated song. With us, the happiest day of the year was fixed since times immemorial: it is Holi. Neither too cold nor too warm and the flame of the forest (palas or tesu) is in its blazing glory.

 Celebrating nonsense

 Sampurna Chatterji is a celebrated Bengali poet and short story writer who specializes in writing and translating nonsense verse: She translated Sukumar Rays Abol Tabol. She is a major contributor in the collection of nonsense verse: The Tenth Rasa, edited by Michael Heyman, Sumanyu Satpathy and Anushka Ravishankar, published recently by Penguin. One of her originals is entitled Idli-Pom:

 Idli lost its fiddli

 Dosa lost its crown

 Wada lost its wiolin

 And let the whole

 band down.

 A Marathi parallel is from the pen of Mangesh Padgavkar:

 The Madrasi tossed

 in a line

 And sang, sa re ga pa

 dha sa,

 When he pulled upon

 the line

 Up came an Idli and a

 Dosa!

 Sumanyu Satpathy of Orissa has his own unique recipe:

 Taught to say ku-ku-du-koo,

 ku-ku, du-koo

 He only said cock-a-doodle-

 doo

 Such a vain cock 

 Youre in for a shock:

 Not tandoori, youll only be

 stew.

 And a more contemporary problem confronted by Oriya Babus 

 He, of Sarankul, Sadanand Satpathy

 Went off riding his brand new

 phat-phati

 The red traffic light

 He crossed with delight

 And thus did the babu attain sadgati.

 Nirupama Dutt specializes in Punjabi folklore, both Pakistani and Indian. In her collection, she has a delightful example of bawdy verse called Sithni sung by the brides girl friends to rile the groom and his male companions :

 So you have come/ yes you have come

 But where have you/ left your mum?

 She will come/ She will come

 Shes just busy/ Shaking her bum.

 Whats the matter, dear mister?

 Whats the matter, dear mister?

 Where have you left/ Your little

 sister?

 Shell be here soon/ So dont you

 titter!

 Shes just effing/ the Barrister.

 For some reason, she has left out the most popular nonsense rhyme which even I remember by heart:

 Keeklee kaleev dee;/ Pug meyrey veer

 dee

 Dopatta meyree mai da/ Phitey

 moonh javaaee daa

 (Keeklee Kaleev dee;/ turban of my

 elder brother

 My mothers dopatta/ Blackened

 face of the son-in-law.)

 The anthology will keep you smiling from page one to the finish.

 A problem with time

 Harivansh Rai Bachchan was a

 widower

 When Teji relivened his gloomy life

 She fell for the Madhushala poet

 And became his loving, devoted wife

 The poets son, Amitabh Bachchan

 A talented actor, played the role of

 angry man

 Though himself very tall, he took

 Tiny Jaya

 As his bride and enlarged his clan.

 Now, Junior Bachchan Abhishek

 A prince of the silver screen,

 Is engaged to Ash, heart-throb of

 millions,

 A Bollywood star and a beauty

 queen

 Senior Bachchan says Abhishek

 proposed to Ash

 In New York where the weather was

 fine

 How come the pair prayed together

 in Kashi

 Much earlier at the Vishwa Nath

 shrine?

 WITH A PINCH OF SALT

 For one more day By Mitch Albom,Sphere, pound; 12.99

 For One More Day is more than a story with a moral. It is an allegorical account of life itself. The novels central theme of re-creation through destruction is one that applies not only to the narrator but to the entire humankind.

 Mitch Albom compels the readers to willingly suspend their disbelief as he probes into the possibility of life after death and of the communication between the world of the dead and that of the living. He creates the aura of the uncanny right in the Prologue. This is a story about a family and, as there is a ghost involved, you might call it a ghost story. But every family is a ghost story. The dead sit at our tables long after they have gone, he says.

 For One More Day is the story of Charles Chick Benetto a lonely and dejected player battered by life. He decides that he is a failure professionally and emotionally, and chooses to end his life. This leads to an examination of the death-drive in man. Chick tries to commit suicide twice on the way to his hometown of Pepperville Beach, but in vain. He is welcomed by his mother, Posey, who died eight years earlier. She has a distinct affinity with the Coleridgean figure of life-in-death but is without its nightmarish quality. It is through her that Chick discovers the power that exists deep within the consciousness and expresses itself in love. 

 Chicks father Leonard once told his son, You can be a mamas boy or a daddys boy. But you cant be both. Chick had chosen to cling to his father. But when his his parents get divorced Chick becomes his mamas boy. Posey single-handedly brings up Chick and his sister, Roberta. She is energetic, dedicated and, unlike her husband, believes that responsibility is not transferrable. On numerous occasions she stands for Chick when he fails to live up to her expectations.

 At the end, the dead Posey discloses why Leonard betrayed her . She invigorates Chick and gives him one more chance to live happily. Albom mingles supernatural magic with psychological truths to create a beautiful story that ultimately celebrates the power of mothers love.

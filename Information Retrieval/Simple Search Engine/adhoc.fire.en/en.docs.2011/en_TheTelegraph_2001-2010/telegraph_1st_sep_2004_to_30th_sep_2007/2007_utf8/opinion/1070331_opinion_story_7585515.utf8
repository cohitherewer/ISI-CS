 From Bach to Gershwin

 MUSIC

 George Gershwin 

 The American violinist, Laura Goldberg is, the founder of Arts Ahimsa, an international network of artists and friends. It organizes concert events around the world, dedicated to promoting non-violence, together with Steven Masi, well-known for his pianistic excellence, and the soprano, conductor, educator, Amy Lieberman. Arts Ahimsa played in concert at the Calcutta School of Music on March 28. They were presented by the American consulate in Calcutta in collaboration with the CSM. The programme began with three well-known arias by J.S. Bach: Et in unum dominum and Laudamus te from the great Mass in B minor, and Erbarme dich from the Saint Matthew Passion. Liebermans exquisite voice, with its light and delicate texture and seemingly effortless phrasing, was beautifully suited to the passion in all three works.

 Bachs concentration on the long and flowing melodic line often paid little heed to the requirements of breathing when writing for voice. However, Liebermans control was skilful and subtle. Laura Goldbergs intense violin obbligato was gently supportive. Beethovens Sonata, Op. 47, No. 9, The Kreutzer, is one of the most demanding in the repertoire, both for violin and piano. Goldberg played with great understanding and skill, her bowing and phrasing flawless. Masis pianistic prowess was evident both as soloist and accompanist, although there was one scary, heart-stopping moment owing to a page-turning mishap, which truly put to test the non-violent principles of Arts Ahimsa. However, the recital continued with calm professionalism .

 The short intermission was followed by Claude Debussys sonata for violin and piano sonata. Written a year before the composers death in 1918, the sonata contains well-loved and recognizable motifs from his earlier styles. The programme concluded with selections from the Great American Songbook, an informal term referring to a period of American popular song-writing from the Thirties to the Sixties. This period was significant for the variety and beauty of melodic form, as also for the romantic pathos and, sometimes, the rueful or droll humour of the lyrics. Liebermans colourful, lilting, honey-flavoured soprano, her dramatic presentation and impeccable diction were delightfully accompanied by Masi. She sang songs from the Richard Rodgers, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern and George Gershwin repertoire. There was a violin interlude by Goldberg and Masi, Gershwins It aint necessarily so from Porgy and Bess, arranged by the immortal Jascha Heifetz. The second violin and piano duo was the Hoedown a toe-tapping, foot-stomping, cowboy fiddling tune from Aaron Coplands Rodeo.

 Cole Porters Youre the top, sung by Lieberman with violin and piano accompaniment, was a great encore. In a brief interview after the concert, Goldberg recalled the workshop with students of the violin held the day before. She commented on the violinists enthusiasm and the ambience of the school. One looks forward to the return of these three generous and dedicated artists.

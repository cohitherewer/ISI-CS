 Disgrace!

 Wisden Anthology 1978-2006: 

 Crickets Age of Revolution 

 Edited by Stephen Moss, 

 Viking, Rs 1,500

 This Wisden Anthology is a sequel to the previous series of four, edited by Benny Green. In this anthology, Stephen Moss highlights an era that can claim to have had a major influence in the evolution of the game. No other period in cricket history has witnessed so many innovative ideas and controversies.

 In the late summer of 1977, Englands new captain, Mike Brearley, led an Ashes victory over Greg Chappells unruly men, proving by the way that an academic can beat the rough-heads at their own game. It was a pertinent point which was substantiated 25 years later by another academically bright captain, Sourav Ganguly of India .

 The period between 1978 and 2006 also saw the ugly side of the gentlemens game. The late Seventies was littered with verbal abuse, physical assault, drug consumption and dreadful behaviour. With the tacit support of his captain, Greg Chappell, the Aussie fast bowler, Dennis Lillee, swung his aluminium bat around to draw publicity. Rodney Marsh and Lillee lay bets against their own team. Greg Chappell forced his brother, Trevor, to bowl under-arm. Shane Warne indulged in banned drugs, illicit sex and gutter behaviour. England found Ian Botham with drugs and Mike Gatting with barmaids. John Lever and Mike Atherton used Vaseline and dirt in their pockets to tamper with the ball. The standard of umpiring in England erased the high impression that Frank Chester and Sid Buller had created. 

 Gradually, cricketing exploits shifted to the east. Indias victory in the 1983 World Cup altered the scenario in the subcontinent notably. Sponsors rushed towards cricket and cricketers at breakneck speed; the media coverage went beyond reason; betting and match-fixing became the order of the day. Commercialization ultimately did succeed in banishing innocence from the game for good. 

 The players, unfortunately, resorted to the worst of passions. Javed Miandad retaliated with his bat as Lillee physically shoved him. Sunil Gavaskar decided that he and his team would withdraw from a test match because he felt like it. Mohammed Azharuddin and Salim Malik fell from their pedestals in the wake of match-fixing charges, while others had influential friends to help them escape the consequences. It was an era which brought down cricket from its lofty heights. But nothing shook cricket more violently than the match-fixing charges on Hansie Cronje.

 Only Sri Lanka and West Indies seemed to be unaffected by the activities around them. But another new entrant Zimbabwes cricket suffered because of political upheavals at home. Another development of the period was the globalization of the game. The emergence of the ICC Trophy is a case in point.

 The many innovations of this period included coloured clothes, white balls, black sight-screens, day-night matches, 30-yards mark, 15-yards circle, and restricted bouncers per over and so on. Suddenly it became a different ball-game. Some purists winced with good reason. But as long as the dollars came in, it was going to be useless to complain.

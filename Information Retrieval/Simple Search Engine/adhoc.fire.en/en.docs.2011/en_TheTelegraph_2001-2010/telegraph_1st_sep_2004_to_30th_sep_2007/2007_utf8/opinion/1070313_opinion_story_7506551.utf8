 SHAKEN UP

 Extraordinary things are happening in Bangladesh. The shake-up is perhaps best illustrated by the arrest of Mr Tarique Rahman, son of the former prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia, on extortion charges. It is not the charge that is really significant. Many other politicians, belonging to the countrys two main parties, have been charged with worse corruption cases. Corrupt politicians are familiar stuff in a country that ranked first in Transparency Internationals worldwide corruption surveys for four years in a row since 2000. The surprising thing is that Mr Rahman was arrested. Over the past five years when his mother ruled the country, he became the most powerful person in Bangladesh. His power and reach, mostly outside the law, extended to practically all aspects of life. He was seen to be the heir-apparent if the Bangladesh Nationalist Party returned to power. His arrest is thus no ordinary step; it speaks of the army-backed interim governments determination to clean up the countrys politics. But such politicians thrived also by corrupting the police, the bureaucracy and even a section of the army. 

 It is also extraordinary that the people have welcomed the armys role in helping the interim governments tough measures. In a country that has seen, and suffered from, several army coups, the armys role in public life is generally viewed with suspicion. But, as the current events suggest, the people are prepared to stand by any institution that promises to save them from bribe-happy politicians and policemen. And the politicians have only themselves to blame for this change in public mood. For more than a decade, politics in Bangladesh was equated with street fights, hartals and other kinds of disruptions. While the people suffered, politicians and their patrons or beneficiaries prospered. Unbridled corruption and the collapse of democracy nearly turned the country into a banana republic. It also became a fertile ground for religious zealots and other outlaws who killed and terrorized freedom-loving people. The most ominous development was that some of these terror groups had been patronized by powerful men in Ms Zias government. Clearly, the interim administration has a long way to go before it can create the right conditions for a truly free poll. But the people seem to be willing to wait rather than be endlessly cheated.

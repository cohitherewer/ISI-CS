 IN THE LORDS NAME

 Political correctness can, at times, warp a sense of history. To be in tune with the times, Pope Benedict XVI, in his new book, Jesus of Nazareth, has excoriated the Western world for its exploitation of Asia, Africa and Latin America. This is not a new theme in the writing of history, but it has not been harped on in public pronouncements from the Vatican. The pope came to this theme by way of an exegesis of the parable of the Good Samaritan. He saw the rich nations of the world cast in the same role as the thieves in the parable. In Benedicts words, the colonies were stripped of their wealth and continue to be plundered in a globalized world. These are strong words, which might even bring Benedict a round of applause from the faithful. But those who are familiar with history will pause to ask what the Church was doing when the European nations, and later the United States of America, shamelessly exploited the countries of what became the Third World?

 Any study of the history of imperial expansion and colonial exploitation shows the close links between the Church and empire-building. The Bible invariably followed the trading boats and the flag. This was true in China, in India, in south-east Asia, in Africa and in the countries of South America. In sending out the missionaries with the traders and the conquerors, there was no distinction between the Roman Catholic and the Protestant churches. The history of the spread of Christianity outside Europe is inextricably linked to the story of imperial expansion. There is no evidence that the Roman Church put a restraining hand on the shoulders of the conquistadors. The same clippers that carried the opium to China in the 18th and 19th centuries often carried the missionaries. Pope Benedict in his condemnation of imperialism has forgotten the role his Church played when Europe lived off Asia, Africa and Latin America. It is significant that in the various uprisings against colonial domination in the 19th century, Christian missionaries were very often the first targets of rebel fury.

 The pope cited, with some approval, Karl Marxs analysis of mans alienation from his species being under the overwhelming influence of capital and profit. Apart from the fact that he invoked the analysis of an atheist and the modern worlds most renowned anti-Christ, this can only be read as an extremely one-sided presentation of Marxs views on alienation and religion. While laying bare mans alienation under capitalism, Marx also noted that religion acted as a salve to alienation. It stood in the way of man realizing his full potential. Religion stopped man from seeing himself as the measure of everything and thus only fortified his alienation from himself.

 The message of Jesus of Nazareth contained a strong moral core of truth. He perhaps anticipated that his followers would deviate from the truth and, on Good Friday, had cried out in despair, Eli eli lama sabachthani.

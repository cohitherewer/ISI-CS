 Extracts from the European Commissions 2007 report on limiting global climate change 

 Climate change is happening. Urgent action is required to limit it to a manageable level. The EU must adopt the necessary domestic measures and take the lead internationally to ensure that global average temperature increases do not exceed pre-industrial levels by more than 2 degrees 

 Celsius.... 

 This Communication proposes that the EU pursues in the context of international negotiations the objective of 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)....Until an international agreement is concluded, and without prejudice to its position in international negotiations, the EU should already now take on a firm independent commitment to achieve at least a 20 per cent reduction of GHG emissions by 2020, by the EU emission trading scheme, other climate change policies and actions in the context of the energy policy... 

 After 2020, developing country emissions will overtake those of the developed world. In the meanwhile, the rate of growth of overall developing country emissions should start to fall, followed by an overall absolute reduction from 2020 onwards. This can be achieved...by taking advantage of the wide range of energy and transport related measures that not only have major emissions reduction potential, but also bring immediate economic and social benefits in their own right.

 By 2050, global emissions must be reduced by up to 50 per cent compared to 1990, implying reductions in developed countries of 60-80 per cent by 2050....Market based instruments such as the EU ETS will be a key tool to ensure that Europe and other countries reach their targets at least cost. The post-2012 framework should enable comparable domestic trading schemes to be linked with one another, with the EU ETS as the pillar of the future global carbon market. The EU ETS will continue to be open after 2012 to carbon credits from the Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation projects under the Kyoto Protocol.

 The EU and its memberstates should decide on a significant increase in investment in research and devel- opment in the areas of energy production and saving. 

 The EUs objective is to limit global average temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels....The Council has noted that this will require atmospheric concentrations of GHG to remain well below 550 ppmv CO2 eq... This will require global GHG emissions to peak before 2025 and then fall by up to 50 per cent by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The Council has agreed that developed countries will have to continue to take the lead to reduce their emissions between 15 to 30 per cent by 2020. The European Parliament has proposed an EU CO2 reduction target of 30 per cent for 2020 and 60 to 80 per cent for 2050.

 ...The GHG emissions trajectory set out in the impact assessment represents a cost-effective scenario to meet the...objective....It shows that emissions reductions by developed countries alone will not be sufficient. Developing country emissions are projected to surpass those of developed countries by 2020, which will more than offset any reductions possible in developed countries beyond that date. Effective action on climate change therefore requires reduced growth in the GHG emissions of developing countries and reversing emissions from deforestation. Furthermore, a sustainable and efficient forest policy enhances the contribution of forests to the overall reductions of GHG concentrations.

 ...The distribution of impacts of climate change is likely to be uneven. Some regions in the EU will suffer disproportionately. For instance, in southern Europe, climate change is likely to decrease crop productivity, increase heat related mortality and have a negative impact on tourism conditions during summer.

 ...Investment in a low-carbon economy will require around 0.5 per cent of total global GDP over the period 2013-2030. This would reduce global GDP growth by only 0.19 per cent per year up to 2030, a fraction of the expected annual GDP growth rate of 2.8 per cent. This is an insurance premium to pay, and would significantly reduce the risk of irreversible damages resulting from climate change. Most importantly, it greatly overstates the effort since no correction is made for associated health benefits, greater energy security, nor does it account for reduced damages from avoided climate change.

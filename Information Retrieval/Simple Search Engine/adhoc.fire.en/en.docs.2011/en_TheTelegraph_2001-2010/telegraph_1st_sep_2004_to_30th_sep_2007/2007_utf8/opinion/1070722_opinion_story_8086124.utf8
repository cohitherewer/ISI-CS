The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 It is now official. India has got its first woman president. But the Congress camp had been celebrating from much earlier. Last Tuesday, Sonia Gandhi threw a pre-presidential victory dinner, where Pratibha Patil was introduced to the UPA-Left leaders. All the heavyweights, including the PM, were in attendance. Even the sick were not spared: RSPs Abani Roy, battling a viral fever, received summons to attend from the PMO. The delicious food added to the cheer, so much so that even some Left MPs were heard cracking jokes CPI(M)s Sudhanshu Sil remarked that his party had issued a whip to ensure attendance. Madam, too, was in a magnanimous mood. She introduced Sil to Patil as the hero from Bengal. Later, when she was told that Farooq Abdullah would vote for Patil, she quipped that the National Conference leader had now been added to the dinner menu. That must have raised a laugh, but does Farooq see the funny side?

 While Congressmen and their allies were attending Sonia Gandhis dinner in the capital, BSP MPs and MLAs were being treated to a sumptuous meal by their boss in Lucknow on the same day. The absence of Mayavatis flock from the Delhi bash had raised a few eyebrows. Especially since a few days ago, Mayavati had played the perfect hostess when Pratibha Patil and UP Congress leaders visited the state to garner support for the prez polls. During the visit, Patil and the members of her entourage were invited to a dinner at the Taj Continental hotel in Lucknow. They were also given a separate room where food was served. There, they were joined by Mayavati and her trusted aide, Satish Mishra. But the BSP MLAs had no place in that room. Mayavati had asked them to have their fare in the common dining hall. This time though, it seems the BSP supremo wanted to show that she cared. Perhaps, that is why she asked her partymen to attend the grand feast in Lucknow and skip the dinner in Delhi. This way, they would not be able to grumble about missing out on the food and the fun in the capital. This may have helped Mayavati to keep her flock together. But surely Congressmen would be saying that she had got her timing wrong.

 There are a few spoilers in every party, including the Congress. One hears that the bigwigs are unhappy with the way the names of the high and mighty were struck down as nominees for the presidential candidate in favour of small fry. But of course, they cannot blame Madam for the oversight, can they? So they have opted for a safer bet, venting their ire on members of the core group, which advises 10 Janpath on all matters. The core group, if one were to believe these men, is followed by a buffer group, comprising those who engage in damage control. Next comes the duffer group which includes ministers, gen-secs and fixers who have no clout. With so many groups, is it surprising that the grand old party of India often resembles a divided house?

 The Marxists have found themselves in the middle of a war of words in Kerala. Mathrubhumi,the Malayalam daily and a rival publication of Deshabhimani, the mouthpiece of the CPI(M), carried an expos that showed a senior functionary of the party organ accepting a princely sum from a tainted lottery king. Forced on the back foot, the state committee announced that it would return the money and also hinted at a probe against the functionary who was held guilty for the impropriety. But the Marxists had no plans of giving up without a fight and launched a fierce counter- attack. Reportedly, Deshabhimani ran a story alleging that the owner of the rival publication, Veerendra Kumar, was an indifferent man who had failed to take care of his sister who was suffering from cancer. As a result, Kumars ailing sister had died, uncared for and unattended. But then, the Reds had got their calculations horribly wrong. For the very next day, Mathrubhumi published a photograph of Kumars sister who, the paper said, was very much alive!

 The Union health minister, Anbumani 

 Ramadoss, is smiling nowadays. And no, it is not because 

 the Centre is said to be planning to amend the laws to clip 

 the current AIIMS directors wings. Ramadosss happiness 

 has to do with the fact that Varnavasi, his birthplace, 

 has been able to achieve a rare feat. The residents of Varnavasi 

 have imposed a ban on tobacco as well as liquor products. 

 Not just that, Varnavasi has also registered the lowest 

 recorded crime rate in the whole of Tamil Nadu. For those 

 who have always wanted to rid themselves of their addictions, 

 now they know which way they should be heading. 

 Footnote

 The World Hindi Meet in New York will be remembered for a long time. But not for any literary reasons. The Indian contingent chose to while away the hours outside, and not inside, the conference hall, prompting a scholar to describe the meet as a maha-picnic. While a handful of NRIs struggled to keep pace with the lectures inside, members of the Indian delegation busied themselves in shopping and sightseeing. But some anxious moments awaited the group at the end of their visit. Upon reaching the Delhi, the delegation leader was horrified to find that some confidential papers had been left behind in the Big Apple. Apparently, three private secretaries had followed our man to New York with their spouses in tow. There, the consulate was instructed to arrange for an adequate number of cars and escorts for the visitors who spent their time taking in the sights and sounds of the lovely city. Little wonder then that files remained untouched and important papers were left behind.

 Wild goose chase

 The chase is still on

Sir Ottavio Quattrocchi, wanted by the government of India as the last accused remaining in the Bofors scandal, was detained in Argentina on February 6. But the government (in other words, the Congress) kept this a secret till February 23. Who knows, the news may have been hushed up altogether. That it finally came out in the open may be because of a leakage in the upper circles (Silence, for a fortnight, Feb 24). The Congress leadership probably wanted the 30-day deadline for extradition to expire without anyone coming to know about the detention. The silence from the government over this new development in the Bofors issue raises suspicions that the largest party in the ruling coalition is uncomfortable with Quattrocchis arrest. In 2006, the government had lifted freezing orders on Quattrocchis bank accounts in London as there was no evidence of the money being connected to the scam. This time, the procrastination over the extradition proceedings by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the government points to their reluctance to pursue a once-shut case. Is the Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi, afraid that Quattrocchis arrest will bring cost her dear? 

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Gupta, Hooghly

 Sir Considering the timing of Ottavio Quattrocchis arrest, one feels that it was a well-thought-out conspiracy meant to embarrass the Congress, especially at a time when quite a few states are about to go to polls. Indias progress along the path of development is perhaps being perceived as a threat by a few developed countries. This perception may have played a part in the arrest. However, the Congresss defeat in some states just before the arrest will provide mileage to the opposition parties. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir Ottavio Quattrocchis detention in Argentina comes at a time when India is shopping for an improved version of the Bofors gun (Bofors phobia stalls gun upgrade, Feb 26). It is vital for mature readers to avoid linking these two issues. If Quattrocchi is guilty of receiving kickbacks in the original Bofors deal in 1986, he should be brought back to India to face a trial. As for the gun, the FH-77B05L52 is an improved version of the earlier one. The Bofors Field Howitzer has displayed its superiority over its contenders. Therefore, let us not throw out the baby with the bathwater. The hullaballoo over Quattrocchi must not make India move away from signing the deal for Boforss new model, especially since the previous model had proved invaluable in Kargil.

 Yours faithfully,

V.P. Singha, Calcutta

 Sir The editorial, Blank fire (Feb 26), has rightly surmised that Bofors is a dead case. The government and the CBI have been caught trying to protect Ottavio Quattrocchis interests for the second time since the Congress came to power. The CBI, supposedly an autonomous investigating agency, has chosen to dance to the tune set by the ruling party. The judiciary must take note of this, and of the CBIs attempts to mislead the Supreme Court.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshay, Secunderabad

 Sir There is no dispute about the worthiness of the Bofors gun. So the debate on its procurement may safely be separated from the renewed controversy about the alleged inducements received during a previous deal with the company. Any suspicions shown now, by way of re-tendering the 400 towed artillery guns, will not only send a wrong signal to the people but it will also demoralize the army and raise a fresh controversy, costlier than the earlier one. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir The hunt for Ottavio Quattrocchi is far from over, for going by the pace at which the CBI is working towards it, one fears that this Italian will forever elude the Indian authorities. New commissions will try to probe the gun deal for the missing crores and the investigations will keep draining the public exchequer. Moreover, members of the commissions and the investigating officers will continue to go on foreign jaunts in the name of the probe. For all their endeavours, it is unlikely that any concrete evidence will be found or the lost money retrieved. In due course, a report will be submitted which will raise a storm in parliament. Finally, in the end, the Quattarocchis will be laughing at the utter incompetence of the Indian authorities. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai 

 Sir How long will the CBI sit on the Bofors issue? It is evident that the investigators have failed to bring the offenders to book so far. Since the former prime minister and one of the main accused, Rajiv Gandhi, is already dead and absolved of all blame, the efforts to revive the case is futile. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The CBIs explanation for its delay to act over Ottavio Quatrocchis arrest that the identity of the person arrested needed to be verified does not hold any water since the information was authenticated by the Interpol. Also, the contention that the CBI could not find a Spanish translator in India is weak. Since government sources have already resigned themselves to the fact that the extradition may not happen, it can safely be concluded that the present dispensation is trying to shield Sonia Gandhi from the heat of the scam. It would be foolish to spend any more money on the wild goose chase.

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

 Sir Ottavio Quattrocchis Argentinian lawyer believes that the Indian government has put together a weak case against him (New CBI counsel for Ottavio extradition, Mar 5). What I fail to understand is why the government is not showing enough enthusiasm to get Quattrocchi extradited. Rajiv Gandhi had to pay a heavy political price for his misdeeds. Will it not be an insult to the former prime ministers memory if Quattrocchi is allowed to escape without paying for his alleged crimes? 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

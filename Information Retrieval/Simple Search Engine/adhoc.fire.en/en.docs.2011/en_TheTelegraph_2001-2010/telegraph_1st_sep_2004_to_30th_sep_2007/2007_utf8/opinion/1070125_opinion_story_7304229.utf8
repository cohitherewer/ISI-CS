 ANY GIRLS STORY

 Neha Sahay

 A horrific incident took place last week. A 16- year-old student, who took up a job as a karaoke singer in a 4-star hotel, was found brutalized in a hotel room, rushed to hospital and pronounced dead. The hotel offered her parents a princely amount to shut up. The parents refused and began going everyday to the hotel, along with their daughters classmates, to demand an explanation for her death. The public security bureau declared she had died of an alcohol overdose and the management put up a notice saying that the deceased had nothing to do with the hotel. Livid, the girls parents tried to tear it off, but the security guards apparently assaulted them.

 By then, it had come to be known that the hotel, which had opened just six months back, was partly owned by a local police chief. It also came out that the girl, who had worked there for just a month, had told her mother she wanted to leave the job, put off by the drug abuse going on in the hotel. The night she was found dead, her boss had apparently asked her to go out with three men who had taken a fancy to her they were reported to be (Communist) party officials. They were the last ones seen with her. They had spiked her drink and reportedly raped her till she died. The incident took place on December 30. On the afternoon of January 17, thousands of locals gathered outside the hotel. The hotel staff used water hydrants on them, only to be stoned in return. Soon, with students taking the lead, the people barged into the hotel, attacking the security guards and smashing window panes. The police stepped aside. The hotel was set on fire, and firemen attacked by the hordes outside. It took four hours for police reinforcements to reach there and allow firemen through the crowd. By then, most of the hotel had been burnt down. Apart form a few arrests, the police did little else.

 Murder club

 The brutalization of the 16-year-old was horrific in itself; more terrifying are the images (taken from mobile phones) on Chinese blogs of the fire raging through the hotel and the crowds outside. Theres more horror: the citys TV station telecast footage of the alleged rapists confession to the court-appointed lawyer. That footage is also on the blogs. It shows the young man handcuffed, admitting his guilt; denying any pressure or torture, and expressing shame and regret. 

 The official media coverage of the incident is interesting. The first report spoke of death due to unknown reasons; but it also mentioned that the suspected rapist had been detained, and the part-owner police chief suspended. About the mass incident, it said that after the fire was rapidly put out, and the crowd persuaded to go home, the incident was over. It ended with the words: If there are (sic) dereliction of duty or abuse of power, then those responsible will be severely dealt with...There will be no mercy.

 Two days later, the suspensions of the local party secretary and the public security director were announced for inappropriate handling of the mass incident. They were asked to do self-criticism.

 A Guangzhou daily, known for stretching the bar to its fullest, interviewed the girls father. Most circumspect, he said he had seen no marks of brutalization on his daughter; he was awaiting the many autopsy reports being prepared. He had heard all the rumours going around, but couldnt make irresponsible talk. He would, however, not let his daughter be cremated till the real murderers were found. The final horror is that this could be any Chinese girls story. Karaoke bars are a dime a dozen; they attract young girls like magnets; they are also known to be mafia hubs. This 16-year-old lived with her parents; most teens in South China live on their own, miles away from their families.

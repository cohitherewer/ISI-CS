The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Blood brothers

 Sir The editorial, An odd world (May 11), has correctly traced the features of Tamil Nadus political culture. The nasty incident in Madurai last week, which claimed three lives, was the fallout of an unsavoury fight for political supremacy between two groups in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. One group is represented by M.K. Stalin, M. Karunanidhis youngest son and his probable successor, and the other is represented by Dayanidhi Maran, a Union minister and son of Murasoli Maran, the late nephew of Karunanidhi. Dinakaran the newspaper whose office was set on fire by the supporters of M. Azhagiri, the other son of Karunanidhi and Sun TV are owned by the Marans. Dayanidhi Marans political base in Tamil Nadu, unlike Stalins, is quite weak, but he has eyes on the chief ministers chair. The survey carried out by the newspaper indicated that the people felt that Maran should handle affairs in New Delhi like his father. This probably provoked Dayanidhi Marans supporters who, in collusion with Karunanidhis other children and their followers, attacked the newspaper office to spread mayhem ahead of Karunanidhis 50th year in state politics. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir What happened in Madurai is shocking. The attack on Dinakaran amounts to an attack on the freedom of the press. The Tamil Nadu government cannot get away with announcing a paltry compensation for the families of the dead. It should ensure that everyone involved in the violence as well as the masterminds, even if they include the chief ministers son, are made accountable and punished for causing loss to life and property. The editorial has rightly said that rationalism is not necessarily a virtue in mass politics. But irrationality seems to have a special place in Tamil Nadu politics. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir M. Karunanidhi may have completed 50 years as a legislator in Tamil Nadu. But was it absolutely necessary to take out huge advertisements in most of the leading national dailies under the aegis of the state government? This is a colossal waste of hard-earned public money. The chief minister of Tamil Nadu could have utilized the same funds for welfare schemes for the poor instead. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kaikanada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir In Nepal, it is reported, there are debates about the perpetuation of dynastic rule. But in India, the same question crops up in different hues, starting from the Congresss craving for leaders from the Nehru-Gandhi family to the succession war in Tamil Nadu. No matter how many times M. Karunanidhi says that democracy is the guiding factor for his party, the opposite has repeatedly been proved true, most recently by the arson on Dinakarans office, which killed three and injured many more. Newspapers are full of statistics about members of parliament, legislators and ministers grooming their children to follow in their footsteps. Whether it is the Nehru dynasty or Bal Thackerays Shiv Sena, it is mostly top-level leaders projecting family rule as the best way to run the party. Thus, we have the likes of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, with no background of mass leadership, leading the Congress, Thackerays son and nephew ultimately splitting in a bitter power struggle, and the Karunanidhi succession drama. All these show that the Indian democracy is too immature in matters of policy and leadership to claim to be the worlds greatest democracy. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir What can be more shameful than a mob setting ablaze a newspaper office and killing three people simply because it did not like the findings of a survey published by the daily? The media have reasons to feel persecuted after this incident. How can the media be expected to deliver the truth under these circumstances? Is the government going to let this assault pass, or do something to save the lives of journalists and media professionals? 

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore

 Sir While reporting the tragic incidents in Madurai, newspapers also reported the details of M. Karunanidhis extended family including the names of his various wives, sons and daughters. Except under Muslim law, having more than one wife is not an option under Indian law, though it is not a cognizable offence if an aggrieved party does not complain. But what sort of moral standards do these worthies set before their followers? And how do they get women among their supporters?

 Yours faithfully,

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

 Parting shot

 Sir With reference to the report, SC asks for report on coal fires and cave-ins (May 3), it may be pointed out that the problem of subsidence pertains to areas in the Ranigunj-Jharia coal belt which have a long history of underground mining of coal going back to a hundred years or more. Water-filled voids were left in mined out areas where stowing by sand was not carried out properly or more coal was removed than the amount allowed under mining regulations. Naturally, these facts are not reflected in mine plans available in the official archives. The only option available now is perhaps the determination of void geometry by geophysical methods, identification of voidless zones and relocation of human settlements and utilities to safer places. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.B. Dutt, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HUGS AND HISSES

 It is a brew of nastiness, trashiness, weepiness, tweeness and political correctness that is only possible in todays Britain with a Bollywood starlet thrown in for good measure. And of course, there is big money involved. The question is, how much can Shilpa Shetty take for three-and-a-half crore? How much will the broadcaster and producer of Celebrity Big Brother make out of this Indo-Anglian fracas, or lose by way of panicking sponsors? And what does it all mean for Britain, whose chancellor is now being grilled in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi on his countrys standards of racial tolerance? Regardless of who stays on and who was thrown out last night from what is probably Englands most dclass house-party, there seems to be some sort of relief in the air at last. Shetty feels calmer, even a bit giggly. And on second thoughts, what she got from her fairer housemates over the last few days does not feel quite like racial abuse now. With the lightest stroke of feminine disingenuousness, she has put it all to inadequate manners, bad diction and the insecurity of women who have worked hard to be where they are right now. Has Shetty figured out that this is as much about class as about race, as most such clashes are in Britain? Anyway, she has hugged her housemates and made up, and Channel 4s profits from last nights eviction-vote will be donated to charities. So all is well again with British multiculturalism, and Shetty is a star back home.

 It took her a while, perhaps, to realize that the ugliest forms of bullying are of the essence of the Big Brother show. So the kind of aggressive behaviour that often erupts in other games, but gets punished by their rules, is actually encouraged and lapped up in this one. Sledging is allowed in the gentlemans game, but not racial abuse, even if muttered by players to themselves and caught unawares on their stump microphones. And no commentator can get away with calling a bearded Muslim cricketer a terrorist. Yet, it is also in the nature of games, however brutal or gentlemanly, to reflect something about the cultures and societies in which they are played and loved. The responses to Shetty from the minor British celebrities cohabiting with her seem to have touched a raw nerve somewhere in a country that cannot seem to make up its famously mixed-up mind about the blisses of the tikka masala and the bane of the hijab. This is why the unsurprising crassness of what has been going on in the Big Brothers Hertfordshire house has bothered a record number of viewers in Britain, and has been registered by the police as a racial incident. It has invited a debate in Westminster and a comment from Downing Street. 

 It is a pity, though, that nobody seems to know for sure whether the bleeped-out word of abuse directed at Shetty was genital or racial. For it is certainly amusing to reflect on a form of political correctness that is willing to take sexist venom in the spirit of a game, but must find a racial slur unforgivably wicked.

 POLITICS OF THE GOVERNED

 Face of change

 Political process in Uttar Pradesh: Identity, Economic Reforms and Governance Edited by Sudha Pai, 

 Pearson Longman, Rs 750

 While much literature exists on mass politics, little attention has been given to the relationship between the politics of identity and changes in the economy and patterns of governance in the post-reforms era. This volume, edited by Sudha Pai, is therefore an important work. Two significant developments in Uttar Pradesh, since the late Eighties, have been addressed here: the rise of identity politics and the course of economic reforms and governance.

 The collapse of the Congress in UP led to a fragmented multi-party system, with the emergence of narrower identity bases like Hindutva, Mandal, and Dalit. New strategies of political mobilization have led to instability and coalition governments. 

 Essays in the first part of this book trace the historical roots of identity politics in UP. G. Kudaisya examines how UP became the heartland of India in the post-Independence period due to its composite culture. Since the late Eighties, the Sangh Parivar has tried to project UP as the site of a resurgent Hindu society. According to Kudaisya, to stabilize the conflict between castes, classes and religions, the state must be broken down into smaller cultural regions. V. Menon shows how the Thirties and Forties were crucial in shaping the organizational machinery and ideology of the Congress. In the post-colonial period, the party was weakened by communal politics and factionalism. S. Misras article examines the politics of coalition at the time of the first general elections in 1937 and its implications for the rise of communalism in the state.

 From Independence till the late Eighties, UP had a stable and predictable political character, but later the Congress was gradually replaced by a fluid and fragmented multi-party system with three poles, consisting of the BJP, the BSP and the SP. Seven essays in the second part of this book examine the rise of these parties, their identity assertion, constant political realignments and splits. A.K. Dubey, S. Gupta and Badri Narayan examine the rise and fall of Hindutva. Gupta investigates how far the BJP was able to capture the hearts and minds of the people regardless of the actual electoral results. Badri Narayan studies the failure of the BJP majoritarionism among the backward classes and the Dalits, who naturally gravitated towards the SP and the BSP. The other chapters in this section analyse various facets of Dalit identity: political representation of the Dalits, BSP politics, and non-political activism by groups like Dalit Panthers. Sudha Pais essay analyses the attempt of the BSP to broaden its base among upper castes and Muslims.

 Articles in the third section focus on political economy in UP in the Nineties. A.K. Singh locates the reasons for slow growth and fiscal problems in the state during the short-lived coalition governments that have followed populist policies and burdened public expenditure. Kripa Shankars essay also tells a somewhat similar story of how the UP economy has deteriorated due to failure of the different governments to tax and accelerate public investment. However, like many economists and political scientists, P. Jha and S. Das in their essays would like to attribute the fiscal strains in UP to the ascendancy of neo-liberal policies by the central government.

 Although related to UP, these studies also provide a lucid understanding of post-reforms polity in India.

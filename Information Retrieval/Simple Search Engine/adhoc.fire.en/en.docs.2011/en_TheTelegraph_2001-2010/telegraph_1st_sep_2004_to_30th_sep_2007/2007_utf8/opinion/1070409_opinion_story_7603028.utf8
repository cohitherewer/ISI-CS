 THE END IS IN SIGHT

 FIFTH COLUMN

 Gwynne Dyer

 It will take a while yet, but the long and brutal reign of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe is probably nearing its end. Not because of the democratic opposition at home, whose members are regularly beaten up and sometimes killed by the regimes police. Not even because neighbouring countries in southern Africa are at last putting pressure on Mugabe to go. Just because his own partners-in-crime have decided that its him or them.

 The key moment actually came last December, when, for the first time, the senior ranks of the ruling Zanu-PF Party stood up to Mugabe and refused to accept his proposal to postpone the next presidential election from 2008 to 2010. It was typical Mugabe salami tactics (Give me two more years, and maybe Ill decide to resign in 2010) but this time it didnt work.

 All that has followed the vicious assaults of opposition leaders by Mugabes police, the South African governments decision to start talking to Mugabes Zanu-PF rivals and Zimbabwean opposition leaders, and the emergency meeting of the leaders of the 14-nation Southern African Development Community in Tanzania is a response to this new perception that Mugabe doesnt have long to run.

 I have been to these SADC summits and I know that behind closed doors they are brutally frank, Mugabes former information minister, Jonathan Moyo, told The Guardian. They will tell Mugabe that his rule in Zimbabwe is dragging down the whole southern African region. None of that got into the meetings closing communique, which ritually expressed solidarity with Mugabe, but Moyo is probably right, because Zimbabwe is becoming a blight on the region.

 Cant let go

 Inflation in Zimbabwe, at 1,700 per cent, is the highest in the world, and average income is less than a tenth of South Africas. Ten years ago, Zimbabwe was seen as the bread-basket of Africa, and it earned ample foreign exchange from exports of tobacco and other cash crops. Now it cannot feed half its people, and the tobacco crop is down by four-fifths.

 There are an estimated three million Zimbabwean economic refugees in South Africa, and they are the main support of those left at home, because unemployment in Zimbabwe is 80 per cent or more. Zimbabwean life expectancy is now the lowest in the world: 37 for men, 34 for women.Then there is the unbridled brutality of the police force, the official contempt for the law, the propaganda that blames all the failings of the regime on foreign imperialists plotting against it its not exactly the image that southern Africans want for their region.

 On the whole, southern Africa does not fit that image. From South Africa to Tanzania, most of the governments in the SADC are democratically elected and law-abiding. Most economies are showing good growth and nobody is starving. But it is a well-known fact that people in other continents have difficulty in telling one African country from another, and that investors are the most ignorant of all. Zimbabwes multiple failures take up more space in the international media than all the news about rest of the thirteen members of the SADC combined, and so the neighbours patience has run out.

 The ideal outcome would be an alliance between Zanu-PF dissidents and Zimbabwes democratic opposition in a transitional government leading to free, internationally supervised elections. The reality may be a good deal messier, because the Old Man doesnt know how to let go. He has just imported 3,000 security personnel from Angola to stiffen his own police, who are deserting in droves and going to work in South Africa because inflation has made their wages in Zimbabwe almost worthless. But one way or another, Mugabes long misrule has reached the beginning of the end.

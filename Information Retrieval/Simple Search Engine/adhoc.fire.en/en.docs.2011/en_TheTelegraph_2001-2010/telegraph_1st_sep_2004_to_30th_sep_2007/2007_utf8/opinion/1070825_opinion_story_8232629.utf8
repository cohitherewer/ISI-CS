The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT OF THE PEOPLE

 The Communist Party of India (Marxist) claims that it runs itself by the old Bolshevik doctrine of democratic centralism. The precise meaning of this term has never been clear since, in practice, in the country of its origin, it meant that whatever Vladimir Illych Lenin and Josef Stalin said became the doctrine that was then blindly followed. There was nothing democratic about democratic centralism. The same can be said about the way the CPI(M) functions. It is led by a general secretary who has never faced a popular mandate but lords it over those who have actually been elected by the people. Thus Prakash Karat is more powerful in the party than, say, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Therefore, Mr Karat can formulate a political line withdrawal of support from Manmohan Singhs government unless the Indo-US nuclear deal is renegotiated which is not favoured by those who have to face the electorate. This anomaly is embedded within an even greater anomaly. In terms of the popular mandate or its own electoral base, the CPI(M) represents a minuscule minority; within this minority, the majority wants Mr Singhs government to continue. Yet Mr Karat wants that the government should fall. What could be more undemocratic than that?

 This has led to the suspicion that Mr Karat is moved by his own fancies and ego rather than by what is good for his party, or the desires and aspirations of those comrades who get themselves elected to parliament and the state legislatures. This peculiar situation prevails because of another odd phenomenon. In India, many political parties the CPI(M) is by no means unique in this follow the practice of having a leader who is not elected by the people. It has been argued with enough justification that the leader of a political party in a democracy should be someone who has been elected by the people through a popular mandate. Such a leader has ipso facto the responsibility of upholding the interests of those who have elected him. He is also accountable to the electorate which can actually recall him after five years. Mr Karat and those in a similar position have no such responsibility, and are not accountable to anyone save a small body called the politburo.

 The CPI(M), however bizarre this may sound, sees itself as a revolutionary party that is forced by adverse circumstances to function in a democratic set-up. This strange situation allows its general secretary to hold an elected government at ransom. The rest of the party duly follows this line. The contradiction is evident in the position of the central committee, which does not want the Indo-US nuclear deal to be operationalized but also does not want the government to fall. The contradiction reflects the opposition between ideology and politics, between a general secretary who never faces a popular election and comrades who have to be elected by the people.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 KEEP COUNTING

 Like many social indicators that help classify Indians into the haves and the have-nots, birth registrations too speak of divides. For people assured of certain privileges, a certificate of birth for the newborn from the municipal authority is a thing that will hardly ever be forgotten in a hurry. It is a mandatory requirement for admission in most schools and is essential for continuing with formal education. The 40 per cent births missing from official records must have happened among those to whom the possession of the document holds no great promise. There is even less conviction on the part of the government that it might. It has made no effort to see that its law making birth registrations compulsory is complied with. Nor has it made such registering bodies accessible to those who have no incentive to go through the trouble. For the state, the 10 million nameless do not count. They are powerless to extract from the state any recognition of their existence or even the much-touted guarantee for universal primary education. It is only when they are 18, and acquire voting rights that is, the power to swing votes and to make or unmake kings that the state wakes up to their presence. 

 That even the other 16 million children present on official records cannot hope for much from the state is part of the same problem. A chain of recent events has shown that the state cannot guarantee children something as basic as their right to life, leave alone their right to identity. Whatever manoeuvrability children gain is through that of their parents. If the latter happen to be poor and powerless, then the children are likely to have their rights trampled on even more savagely. One needs only to look at the startling figures of the missing or the numbers engaged in child labour to gauge how the Indian state cares for its future citizens. It is shameful that the government should depend on events like the Noida killings to remind it that it has no mechanism in place to assure children their rights or to protect them from offences.

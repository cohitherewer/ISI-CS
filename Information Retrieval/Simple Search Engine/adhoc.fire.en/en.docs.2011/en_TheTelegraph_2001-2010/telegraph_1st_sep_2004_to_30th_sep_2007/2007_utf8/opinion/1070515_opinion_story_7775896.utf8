 PAPERED OVER

 Delusions increase with age. Which explains why Tamil Nadus octogenarian chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, was not assailed by self-doubt while proclaiming recently that dynasty has no place in the politics practised by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. The torching of the Dinakaran office by his sons angry supporters to avenge the publication of an offending survey, and now, more than ever, the resignation forced upon the Union IT and communication minister, Dayanidhi Maran, ought to have proved him wrong. But the DMK, like many other parties in India, has so admirably coopted democratic principles into its dynastic ambitions that it is no longer unbearable to see party politics becoming a thriving family business. The decision to recall Mr Maran from the Centre, in fact, was taken in an exemplary exercise of party democracy a three hour-long debate conducted in a fully-attended meeting. Political parties in India have repeatedly carried out similar exercises to browbeat adversaries of political families and ensure the latters unchallenged sway over the party. In that sense, Mr Marans predicament may not have been very different from Sharad Pawars after his expulsion from the Congress.

 There can be no denying that the DMK is well within its rights to sit in judgment over the conduct of a party member. Mr Maran, together with his family members, is alleged to have shown disrespect to the Karunanidhi scions, to have tried to wreck family unity and foment trouble in the smooth transfer of the party mantle. Yet it is unfortunate that the worth of a popularly elected leader is determined on the basis of how well he serves the ends of his party and its reigning deities, and not those of the people from whom he receives his mandate. The fact that Mr Maran himself finds no unreason in carrying out the dictates of his political family shows that in accepted wisdom public responsibilities are indistinguishable from the private demands of politics.

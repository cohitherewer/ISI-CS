 TOO MANY, TOO LITTLE

 Sharmila Basu Thakur

 Dance

 Too many cooks spoiled the feast at Kalamandalams programme, Kalamandalam Sangeetotsav 2007, at Purbasree Hall, Bharatiyam Complex on May 12 and 13. In collaboration with the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre, the two-day festival featured 35 dance numbers by a large number of students of different branches of the institution. Choreographed and directed by Thankamani Kutty, and dedicated to Guru Govindan Kutty, the programme comprised an array of traditional Bharatnatyam presentations, starting from invocation to tillana. The evening commenced with a salutation to Shiva, followed by the worshipping of the Rangadevata. Enthusiastic little dancers performed earnestly and created an appropriate ambience. 

 Another colourful piece was based on raga Kuntalavarali, where advus or basic steps of the Bharatnatyam dance style were set to music. It was followed by Ganesh keertanam in raga Hamsadhwani. Composed by M. Balamuralikrishna, this wonderful presentation was really enjoyable. Jatiswaram, a pure dance number in which rhythm and footwork are of main importance, and jatis or dance syllables are set to music, was based on raga Saveri and roopakam taal. The dancers in traditional costume performed whatever they have learnt from their teachers with an earnest effort. The presentation of varnam, one of the most delicate and difficult items in Bharatnatyam, was average. However, the sufferings of the nayika on being separated from her beloved was expressed with grace and poise. The keertanam by Barnali Datta, portraying Shivas tandava, was marked by a synchronization of skilful footwork and bold movements. Despite her pleasing stage presence, the dancer at times failed to sustain the energy, an important attribute of a classical dancer. 

 Akashlingam by Jhinuk Mukherjee (picture) was an expression of the cosmic power of Nataraja. Despite her speed, stability and line, the dancer lacked elegance. Confined to a limited space throughout her presentation, the grandeur and majestic character of Nataraja was not revealed. Tillana, the grand finale of this style, was devoid of joy and ecstasy. To do justice to the little dancers and learners, and also to the audience, special items could have been choreographed instead of the traditional numbers which require maturity and depth of understanding. 

 In spite of the enthusiastic dancers, reasonably good taped music and authentic costume, the programme was run-of-the-mill because of its stereotypical perspective and lack of an innovative dimension. With too many numbers, interjected with the announcement that parents of children who performed in the last item could collect their children from the backstage, the programme became monotonous, testing the patience of the audience.

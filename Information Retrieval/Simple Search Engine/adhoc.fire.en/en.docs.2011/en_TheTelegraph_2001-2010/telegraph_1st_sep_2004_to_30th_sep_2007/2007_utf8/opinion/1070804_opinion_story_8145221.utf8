 WITH AN IRON HAND

 What is it like for an adult to beat up a child? Not a slap, or a box in the ears but repeated lashings with a cane, or slaps and kicks followed by beatings with an iron rod, or the head dashed against a wall, the cheeks and ears hit, over and over again, with a ruler or duster. Such cases are reported every day from all over the country. A few days ago in Rajasthan, a 17-year-old boy died of head injuries allegedly caused by his teachers use of an iron rod on him. Last month, a Class-II student with a chronic lung disorder, going to a school in Krishnagar, started vomiting at home after being beaten by his teacher, who knew about his illness. In their homes, in various invisible and illegal workplaces, in remand homes and orphanages, on the streets, and more and more frequently in schools, children are being beaten up brutally as punishment. In most cases, especially in the classroom, this form of punishment is regarded by the teacher as a perfectly acceptable way of enforcing discipline and as an unavoidable part of education. In each case, there is an element of uncontrollable excess, a surplus energy driving the violence that makes it look like an act of pleasure. In almost every case, the fact that there is a law against corporal punishment is deemed irrelevant, or the teacher did not know about the law. In many cases, including the one in Rajasthan, the teacher is a woman, who sees herself as engaged in some sort of a moral crusade against cheating, lying, stealing, or even taking mid-day meals home instead of eating them in school.

 Cruelty, according to a poet, has a human heart. Hence a great deal of it is likely to remain inexplicable. Yet, the State and stakeholders in civil society will have to come to a practicable understanding of such violence. (And to understand or explain it is not to justify the cruelty.) The latest countrywide study of child abuse reveals that 65 per cent of children have reported corporal punishment in schools, with a high rate of incidence in Bengal. Also, older children are beaten more compared to younger ones, and a very high percentage of the beatings was reported in government and municipal schools.

 Men and women who feel that they are less-than-badly paid, poorly respected and have to struggle along within a dismally inadequate infrastructure, in pockets of society already plagued by poverty and under-development, will unthinkingly take their frustrations out, their feelings of social injustice, on the most accessible and vulnerable members of this world of wrongs. Such a logic is reinforced by social and familial structures, in urban as well as rural India, that continue to be fundamentally unequal, feudal and patriarchal. Women have reasons to feel particularly victimized within these structures. And it is well within the realm of the imaginable that a violent abuse of power in one sphere could arise from a feeling of the bleakest disempowerment in another. Considerably more than anger-management classes for teachers, as suggested by the state government, may be required here.

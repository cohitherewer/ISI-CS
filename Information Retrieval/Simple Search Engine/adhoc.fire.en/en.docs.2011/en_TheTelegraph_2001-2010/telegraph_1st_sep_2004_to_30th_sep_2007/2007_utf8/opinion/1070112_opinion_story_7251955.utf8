Little shadows in the streets

 Midway Station: Real-life stories of homeless children (Penguin, Rs 150) by Lara Shankar is refreshingly different because it does not talk about children but lets the children themselves talk. Focusing on destitute children in a government shelter in Delhi, this book is an account of the lives they led before they were brought there, and of their present experiences. The author, a child-rights activist, documents each childs life in detail and takes care to preserve the childs voice. More than their stories, what will strike the reader is the maturity with which the children perceive the world around them. These invisible faces of Indias future get a distinct, resolute identity through their own narratives.

 Sumit runs away (Frog, Rs 300) by Mahesh Suvarna is a confused babble of completely unprocessed prose. The story, supposed to be about a college student and his friends, is more like an essay written in primary school with the wonder of the uninitiated. The authors attempt at a cavalier style loses its fizz after the very first page. This is one book the reader should definitely run away from. 

 Identity and Survival: Sikh militancy in India 1978-1993 (Penguin, Rs 395) by Kirpal Dhillon, who became Punjabs director-general of police after Operation Blue Star, is a first-hand description and analysis of the operation and its impact on Indias Sikh community. This book seeks to delve into the psychology behind both the radicalism in Punjab during that time and the subsequent army retaliation. Apart from the chronological facts, there are vivid glimpses of state terror that fuelled minority insecurities. From the tension triggered by the drawn boundaries of independent India, to the dominant role played by the police in fostering militancy, Dhillon diligently records and re-assesses the factors that posed a threat to the Sikhs as a part of the larger national structure. 

 The Assassin and the Dahlia (Edition Pphoo, Rs 100) by Pradip Choudhuri is, as Gerald Nicosia says in the Preface, the kind of poetry that has no true beginning, no true end. His images evoke the piquant pleasure-pains of city life, its rigours and lethargy, and all its allure. One phrase strikes a wrong chord though Is in the opinion that. It is perhaps just a typographical error and not deliberate.

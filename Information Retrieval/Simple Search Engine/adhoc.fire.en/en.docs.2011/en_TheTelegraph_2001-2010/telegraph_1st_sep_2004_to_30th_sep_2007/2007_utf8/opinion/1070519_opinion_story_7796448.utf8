 CASTE FOR HIGHER THINGS

 For the first time, Mayavati has been able to breach the divides in UPs caste-ridden society, and that is no mean thing, writes Sumanta Sen

 Looks like cakewalk

 No word of praise is enough for the resounding success of Mayavati in the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Yes, it was a personal success, as the Bahujan Samaj Party is Mayavati, and Mayavati alone. Also, she fought the battle with no Kanshi Ram around, the man who had started it all. Even then, she has been able to take the party to a position of eminence which nobody had thought would be possible at the time of its birth in Bundelkhand not too long ago. Now, when she talks about being the prime minister a decade hence, one has to say it may not be impossible.

 For Mayavati is today not just the voice of the Dalits. In UP, the poor, irrespective of caste and religion, have voted for her. Why cannot this be an indication of the future in other states also? The only stumbling block may be her personality and her way of doing things. To the distant observer, her past does not exactly inspire confidence.

 During the run-up to the election in Indias largest state, the common refrain of the opposition campaign was, Get rid of Mulayam Singh Yadav and you will have a better future. Mulayam Singhs response in the later stages, when he realized that the going was getting tougher for him with every passing day, was, You throw me out, and they will send me to prison. He has indeed been thrown out, but will it now be jail for the former wrestler?

 If the UP electorate had chosen the Bharatiya Janata Party (the Congress continues to be of no relevance in the state), then it could have been said for certain that it would not have chosen the path of vindictiveness; as a national party, it has a definite political agenda to pursue. But one cannot be so sure with Mayavati, whose entire campaign rested on teaching Mulayam and Amar Singh a lesson. Whether the two will actually be sent to prison is not the point, the point is that in the days to come, the issue of teaching a lesson may take up a lot of time of the new government. Not at all what the beleaguered state needs.

 Mayavati, of course, would say that was exactly how Mulayam Singh had behaved with her in the last four years. First he had stolen away her legislators to reduce her party to a minority and then, as she sees it, got the Taj Corridor case going against her. So she has to hit back. She may as well point to the results and claim that she enjoys the peoples mandate for her future course of action.

 And, in New Delhi, the Congress may well be with her. The party sees its fight with the Samajwadi Party leader as more personal than anything else, Mulayam Singh Yadav having in the past successfully opposed attempts to install Sonia Gandhi as the prime minister. The tenor of Rahul Gandhis speeches also made it clear that like Mayavati, he and his party also had something personal against him and his principal lieutenant, Amar Singh.

 The Congress has to be with the lady in Lucknow for other reasons too. The presidential election is imminent, and the party needs the votes of the BSP members of parliament and legislators. Mayavati, of course, will ask for her pound of flesh. And what better than an assurance that the Central Bureau of Investigation will go slow on the Taj Corridor case? All claims that the CBI works independently should be taken with a pinch of salt.

 The purpose in saying all this is not to weep for the possible future of Mulayam Singh and Amar Singh. The worry right now is that the key issues related to bijli, sadak, pani will continue to be ignored. The states experience with Mayavati in the not-so-distant past makes one even more confident in making such a prediction. Also, the BSP was the only player to have jumped into the election fray without a manifesto, so none will be able to blame her for not honouring pre-poll promises.

 Talking of election promises, do people really believe in them, particularly in the villages at the back of beyond? The answer is, no. But at the same time, when they get disgusted with the state of affairs, they look for an alternative and choose the one with the most healthy look. In UP, the BJP, a strong contender, just did not present that look, with its inner-party feud out in the open. That perhaps was the only factor responsible for its poor showing. Secularists may say that the performance also indicated a decline of Hindutva, but then how to explain the partys much better showing in Uttarakhand, Punjab and in the Delhi municipal elections? If the party could be seen as a good choice in these places, then why not in UP? True, at none of these elections was Hindutva or the Ram mandir a direct issue, but its shadow falls wherever the BJP is. In fact, L.K. Advani had even reportedly said he would stop saying Jai Shri Ram if UP turned its face away from the party. The desperation could have been caused only by the Rajnath Singh-Kalyan Singh divide. The Samajwadi Party is also afflicted by inner-party squabbles. Many of its leaders are unhappy with the way in which Mulayam Singh has agreed to remain in the clutches of Amar Singh, and thereby, of a culture alien to socialists. The roping in of Amitabh Bachchan was also not able to please many in the party.

 The BSP, being a single-leader party, had no such problem. But Mayavati may have serious problems ahead. It is not just the Dalits who have voted for her en bloc, but also sections of the upper castes and Muslims. She will have to keep this rainbow coalition alive. This may not be easy on a long-term basis in a caste-divided society. Her upper-caste supporters may, with time, become jittery if they find her sympathizing more with the Dalits which, of course, will only be natural. This basic difference is sure to surface if she insists on a presidential candidate whom she prefers on considerations of caste. In the Hindi belt, a Brahmin may, for tactical reasons, join hands with a lower caste, but will never be prepared to surrender his caste identity. Good governance can take care of such problems, but is Mayavati capable of giving that to the state?

 If Mayavati fails, it will be unfortunate for her and for Indian politics. For the first time in a caste-ridden society, she managed to break through caste barriers something the Left has always been dreaming of doing. It is the rural poor who have stood by Mayavati. She must realize that she has not won just an election, but has aroused high hopes.

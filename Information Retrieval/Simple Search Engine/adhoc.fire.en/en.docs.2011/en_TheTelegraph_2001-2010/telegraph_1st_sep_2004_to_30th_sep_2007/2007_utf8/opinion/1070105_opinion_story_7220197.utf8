 POLLS NEXT DOOR

 Democracy is not all about victory or defeat in elections. What is more important to both democracy and an election is the peoples trust in being able to choose their representatives freely. It is possible to argue, though, that the party system is not the best form of direct democracy because the parties may not always represent the people. For a nascent democracy such as the one in Bangladesh, the parties and the electoral system help mould the popular will. That cause is not served if one of the largest political groups in the country decides to boycott elections. The decision of the 14-party alliance, led by the Awami League, to boycott next months parliamentary polls cannot, therefore, be good for the young democracy. But the responsibility for the alliances move really rests with the countrys president, Mr Iajuddin Ahmed. He has failed to assure not just the alliance but also the people in general that the elections will be fair. This feeling was reinforced by the resignation of some of the advisors of the interim government whom Mr Ahmed had appointed. Even so, the League and its allies were prepared to give the elections a chance. That was why their candidates had filed their nominations for the polls. But Mr Ahmeds refusal to even try to clean up the electoral process left the League leader, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, with no choice but to withdraw from the polls. 

 Bangladeshis as well as the international community looked forward to next months elections with great hopes. They expected the polls to restore many of the democratic values, which were under attack in the past few years. Not just opposition politicians but also civil rights and minority groups, the media and other independent social institutions bore the brunt of the countrys slide into anarchy. Begum Khaleda Zias five-year rule saw Bangladesh becoming a new haven for Islamist fundamentalists. To the international community, it became almost a rogue state. The elections would have provided Bangladeshis their chance to stem the rot. Mr Ahmed will complicate matters if he insists on holding the elections without the participation of the League and its allies. A government elected through such elections will have no legitimacy either to the people of Bangladesh or to the world. India being the worst victim of the rise of terrorism in Bangladesh, it must use diplomatic and other means in order to prevent the birth of a banana republic next door.

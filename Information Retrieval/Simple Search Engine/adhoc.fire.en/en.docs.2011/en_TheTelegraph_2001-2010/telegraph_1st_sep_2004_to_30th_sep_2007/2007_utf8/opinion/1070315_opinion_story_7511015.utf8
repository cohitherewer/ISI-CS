 Question of discipline

 Sir Ashok V. Desai, in The point of democracy (Mar 13), suggests that the parties involved in the land acquisition debate in Singur the farmers, the Tata group, the government of West Bengal, and Mamata Banerjee should have a meeting to resolve their differences. However, after a decision has been taken unilaterally by the government, no amount of dialogue can be fruitful at this stage. Had the government been wise enough, it would have encouraged the Tatas to negotiate directly with the landowners before purchasing the land required for the small-car project. By interfering in the deal, the government has committed a huge blunder. The forcible acquisition of land owned by farmers at a dictated price, not for the purpose of building public utilities, such as roads, bridges, railway lines or airport, is against the fundamental principle of right to property. The farmers, who risk losing their age-old profession, have every right to oppose the acquisition. Those who spend a greater part of their lives in luxury are hardly qualified to lecture farmers on the utility of special economic zones, for which the latter have to sacrifice their sole asset and livelihood.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir It was refreshing to read Ashok V. Desais views on democracy. His article reveals, with superb clarity, the differences between developed and developing nations. The only qualification necessary to become a peoples representative in our country is good criminal connections. This trend was reinforced some years ago with the induction of the high-profile smuggler of the time, Haji Mastan, into the Rajya Sabha. Nothing has changed; now we have Abu Salem waiting in the sidelines. We do not practise democracy, but a perverted version of domestic colonialism. Indias fate rests in the hands of criminals, filmstars and businessmen, whose knowledge of good governance is inadequate at best. Sadly, those who can clean the Augean stables have chosen to remain silent spectators. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir About twenty years ago, when I was in school, I was a big fan of some lawn tennis stars of the time, such as Steffi Graff and Martina Navratilova. My interest in the the game was born out of my fascination for these players. During those days, what used to surprise me was the response of the spectators to a mere call of Quiet please from the chair umpire. I think discipline is ensured either by the fear of punishment or by the practice of it in everyday life. In the case of the Indian democracy, both the conditions are absent. Politics in our country is motivated by petty material gains, and our members of parliament specialize in creating unrest inside and outside the house. They are the last persons who can be expected to reform the electorate. 

 Yours faithfully,

Joyati Bhattacharya, Silchar, Assam

 Sir It was good to see Ashok V. Desai bring up the subject of parliamentary behaviour. The words and deeds of our MPs clearly show that dialogue is not their favourite word in the dictionary.

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Mitra, Konnagar

 Dog-day weather

 Sir Recently, a television channel put a question to its viewers: Is it realistic to terminate stray dogs? As many as 66 per cent of the respondents agreed that it is so. The scale of this response leaves one totally stunned. Under no circumstance should the government of any state take the horrific step of eliminating mongrels from the streets. Why does the government not have a mass sterilization programme for these animals? Why is there no anti-rabies awareness programme in spite of the rise in canine attacks? Instead, the government has taken the easy and inexpensive, but inhuman way out. But that is what happens if you have the power to go against the law.

 Yours faithfully,

Rudraya Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir More teeth for drive (March 13) reminded me of a programme that was telecast on a news channel on March 12. On that programme, much to my shock, I heard a lady say that in no civilized society do we find stray dogs on the streets. So her solution was simple, but totally barbaric just terminate them. I wanted to remind her what Mahatma Gandhi had said about civilized society. He had said that the mark of a civilized nation is in the way it treats its animals. Surely there are more humane ways to be a civilized society. We dont wipe out the human race just because a madman hit someone with a stone. We even provide the right of self-defence to a psychotic murderer. And dogs are just poor defenceless animals. Instead of eliminating them, we should provide shelters for stray dogs. It is a difficult but achievable end, and certainly a more humane proposition than eliminating them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Meena Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir In view of the recent inhuman treatment meted out to stray animals in Bangalore, and the illiterate and stupid solution worked out by the civic authorities to meet this crisis, I regret to say that as of this moment, I feel nothing but shame to call myself an Indian. I have lost all pride in my culture, which I held on to so dearly living here in Edinburgh. Indians still have a long way to go before they can call themselves civilized. Our actions are in conflict with our claim to a 9,000-year-old civilization, which has now been reduced to a torn and faded robe we use to hide our many flaws. 

 Yours faithfully,

Prajit Chatterjee, Edinburgh, UK

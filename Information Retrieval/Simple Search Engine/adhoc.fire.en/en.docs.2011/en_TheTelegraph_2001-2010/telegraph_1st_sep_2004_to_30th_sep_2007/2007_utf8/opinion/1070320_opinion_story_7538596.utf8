The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WARNING SIGNAL

 The irony is inescapable. Within weeks of the finance minister, Mr P. Chidambaram, announcing a 9.2 per cent growth for the Indian economy, Maoists in Chhattisgarh launched their bloodiest offensive anywhere in the country in decades. It may have happened in a far outpost on the frontline of Indias war on the Maoist rebellion. But its impact is too serious for the rest of the country to ignore. Its warning should upset cheerleaders of the unstoppable India Inc. It is not that the governments, at the Centre or in the states, are not worried. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, has described the Maoist rebellion as the worst security threat the country has faced since independence. The time has come to seriously analyse why the Maoists continue to receive the support of an increasing number of people in half of Indias 29 states. Even more important, there is no time to lose to act on some fundamental issues. Governments, policy-planners and administrators agree that decades of social and economic deprivations push the poorest of the people into the Maoist rebellion. Remedial measures rarely go beyond the worst forms of tokenism. The solutions do not lie in building some roads and schools or offering cash compensations to victims of Maoist violence. A larger action plan is needed in order to ensure basic social and economic security for the poor whose desperate conditions the rebels exploit.

 Once such issues are tackled, the states use of force may be more effective than it has been so far. If the governments strategy to involve the people in the battle against Maoists has not succeeded, it is primarily because of the failures on the socio-economic front. The significance of the Maoist offensive on the anniversary of the formation of Salwa Judum, or the tribal peace militia, should not be lost on the government in Raipur or in New Delhi. From the rebels point of view, the timing of the massacre was meant to warn the tribal people not to join the battle on the governments side. There have been differences among major political parties on the efficacy of using the tribal militia against the Maoists. However, there should be absolutely no confusion about the need to stamp out the rebellion. At stake is the future of democracy and a free society in India.

 LESSONS FOR THE MASTER

 Fragile things 

 By Neil Gaiman, Headline, pound; 6

 Neil Gaiman is trapped between the chaos of dreams and the desire to experience life as always already story-shaped. A compulsive harvester of tales Gaiman has spent his adult life making things up and writing them down he reminds us of poor Scheherazade, doomed to manufacture stories ceaselessly. 

 Gaiman writes about her in his poem, Inventing Aladdin, included in this collection, where, as she dozes off at the end of yet another story-shaped night after her tyrannical husband has fallen asleep, she is haunted inexorably by the tale she has stopped telling midway: The tale will need an end, but now it melts to dreams inside her head. Gaimans tales of mystery and imagination, collected in this volume, subtitled Short Fictions and Wonder, have a various genesis. They evolve out of a tradition comprised of the Anglo-Saxon sagas, Renaissance grotesque (Spenser, Hakluyt, Nashe), 18th-century wonder narratives, Romantic supernaturalism and Gothic (Coleridge, De Quincey, Poe), as well as anthropological research on local myths and superstitions (on zombies, for instance) carried out by Zora Neal Hurston. And of course, the greats of graphic literature Harvey Pekar, Alan Moore and Douglas Adams are indispensable to Gaimans creativity. This eclectic reading forms the imaginative core of Gaimans work, making it generically adventurous sometimes the stuff of traditional sci-fi, at other times invoking the ardent romanticism that lies at the heart of James Joyces Araby. The authorial voice is fashioned out of this duality. There are moments when Gaiman speaks with the disarming inexperience of a 15-year-old, then resurfaces in the very next story, with the weary scepticism of the bohemian writer on the prowl, keenly observant, addicted to scribbling notes, and with a capacity for taking in any number of surprises. 

 His stories are based on incidents, often carefully recalled from a distant past, or chanced upon serendipitously in forgotten, old notebooks. These are fragile things made up of nothing stronger or more lasting than twenty-six letters and a handful of punctuation marks. His stories often put together by combining literary characters with a series of bizarre, but true experiences represent a dappled world where time is fluid. Sherlock Holmes appears in A Study in Emerald; the worlds most beautiful boy, a specimen of the (fictional) tribe, Shahinai, is sold off to a mafia-don with the ludicrously camp name, Mr Alice, in Keepsakes and Treasures; the insoluble problem of Susan in the Narnia stories is discussed; a Henry Jamesian governess meets her nemesis in Forbidden Brides of the Faceless Slaves in the Secret House of the Night of Dread Desire. 

 Gaimans fiction, just like his graphic novels, is imagistic, trespassing into what the author has himself described as pornographic horror. He uses the first-person unabashedly to forge manifold personalities, attitudes and eccentricities, bringing into the stories a skewed perception of the world. As the film of reality is removed, the deep romantic chasms are exposed, unfathomable in their darknesses. Beautiful girls, in Gaimans stories, turn out to be aliens or huldra, the monster women in Nordic legends. 

 It is difficult to decide if Gaimans stories are just fantasies or whether they are invested with allegorical meanings. Although written charmingly, they run the risk of becoming tedious with their predictable cleverness, the calculated surprise, and the measured doses of horror, sex and violence.

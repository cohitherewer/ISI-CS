 ILLUSION AND REALITY

 Homage to a dream 

 COMINTERN AND THE 

DESTINY OF COMMUNISM 

IN INDIA 1919-1943

By Sobhanlal Datta Gupta, Seribaan, Rs. 695

 Today nobody, save the loony fringe, dreams of a world proleterian revolution. Yet the cry workers of the world unite was the first cry of globalization long before the latter became the buzz word. The cry inspired many, and after the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, the Third International (Comintern) was formed to carry forward the task of the world revolution. It did not take very long for the dream to be shattered, and many, including communists, came to realize and accept, much to their pain and shock, that the Comintern had done very little to fulfil its original charter of promise.

 Datta Guptas work is a piece of revisionist history writing. The word revisionist is used here shorn of its ridiculous communist baggage. He has revised practically all accepted notions and conclusions about the Comintern vis--vis Indian communists. The revision includes some of his own conclusions arrived at in a previous work on the same subject. Such a revision calls for an enormous amount of intellectual courage rarely seen in people, even in the best scholars.

 In one profound way, the revision has been forced upon the author by the sheer weight of the empirical evidence that has surfaced from the archives of the erstwhile Soviet Union. What is remarkable is that Datta Gupta, instead of remaining content with his earlier conclusions, decided to mine these archives without prejudice and arrive at conclusions that were at variance with his earlier ones. He has also extensively used archives in Germany and Britain.

 There is one area in which the facts and conclusions of this book are of some significance. Datta Guptas findings show that as a matter of deliberate policy the Comintern had decided to make the Communist Party of Great Britain the guardian of the communist movement in India. The Indian communist party ran, with regard to policy and its implementation, on the diktats of R.P. Dutt and Harry Pollitt, the two leaders of the CPGB. 

 One important consequence of this was that Indian communists remained anti-Gandhi, despite the fact that Gandhi was the only mass-leader of the Indian nationalist movement. This is not a point that is absolutely new. There was enough oral and circumstantial evidence going around to suggest that the CPI was R.P. Dutts southpaw, but it is good to have the point established to the hilt by Datta Guptas researches. The Comintern, in the name of world revolution, stood by and watched the autonomy of the CPI being totally circumscribed by the CPGB. It is another matter altogether that among most Indian communists (at least those with some intellectual pretensions) R.P. Dutt (or RPD, as he is known in communist lore) remains a kind of demigod.

 Indian communists disaffinity with Gandhi has a longer history. In 1928, the Comintern adopted the class against class strategy for all communist parties. The original draft had been prepared by Nikolai Bukharin, but this was distorted by Josef Stalin and an ultra-left stance introduced. The fallout was disastrous: the idea of a united front against imperialism was abandoned, and all nationalist forces were written off as henchmen of imperialism. In India, this meant that Gandhi, Nehru, Subhas Bose et al were seen as class enemies. This resulted in the Indian communists becoming distant from, if not hostile to, the nationalist movement and from the people.

 There are other nuggets that Indian communists have refused to accept. Datta Guptas findings clearly show that both Abani Mukherjee and Virendranath Chattopadhyay, Indian communists in Soviet Russia, were liquidated by Stalin.

 There is one major problem with this book despite its empirical strength. It assumes that its findings are of some relevance today and also that they are of general interest. But the history of Indian communism attracts very little attention except among ex-comrades. The collapse of communism has diminished the relevance of the history of communism. The book is touched by a certain poignancy. It tells the story of how a group of bright young men and women dedicated their lives to bring to earth a dream. All they actually did was to chase a monster created in their cherished fatherland.

 HOW NOT TO STAGE A WEDDING 

 Malvika Singh

 MALA FIDE 

 Marriages solemnized at tourist 

 destinations rather than at home have become the trend for 

 the rich and famous but not yet for the rooted and gracious. 

 Three or four marriages to the same person within a few 

 days, is the other theatrical enactment that adds to the 

 ongoing tamasha. The solemnity of the ceremony that 

 unites two people seems to have taken a backseat as the 

 extravaganza unravels slowly but steadily over a week at 

 least. Event planners look for new fancy ideas on how 

 to create pandals, decorate and embellish them, design wild 

 and unwieldy cards that beckon invitees to these elaborate 

 congregations, usually in an alien space. Here the managers 

 create specially crafted and designed stand alone, sterile 

 but glitzy spaces for the many events. They have no connection 

 with the bride, groom and their families, their everyday 

 lives or their erstwhile and present backgrounds. 

 Strangely, the dream these couples 

 appear to have is one in which they long to play king and 

 queen, prince and princess, having been born commoners. 

 They tend to choose forts and palaces that belong to other 

 people as the venue for their wedding. That helps them fantasize 

 about being someone they are not, in a place where they 

 can play a part, much like in a play. They try and dress 

 like a maharajah, throwing their own cultural identity 

 to the winds. It is unreal, sometimes surreal and, more 

 often than not, forced and a trifle pretentious. In some 

 ways, this business of using sacrosanct ceremonies to launch 

 a show, makes a mockery of the marriage rituals. Better 

 sign a register in court and then party wherever possible, 

 in fancy dress, pretending to be what you dreamt of as a 

 child. 

 Event management

 Traditional tentwallahs 

 in India are ingenious. They are able to create awnings, 

 tents, pandals and faades of all description. They produce 

 great quality mock-ups for those willing to pay for the 

 best. It is a skill that is going unrecognized. They can, 

 with ease, create the faade of a fort, a large cut-out 

 that could transport you to another part of India, momentarily, 

 as you enter its portals. This is a cheaper alternative 

 to a live fantasy! The flower people those who weave 

 the garlands and hand craft the other floral ornamentation 

 are masters of their art. With magic fingers, they pattern 

 fragrant walls and canopies that are unsurpassed anywhere 

 in the world. 

 In all of this, and having seen 

 some and read about others, the one wedding in a fort on 

 the banks of the river Narbada, home of the bride, stands 

 out and will never be matched by the enactments we are 

 compelled to hear about, expected to salivate on and regret 

 for not being a part. An erstwhile prince had the marriage 

 of his daughter at the fort palace. It was held in the ancient 

 Shiva temple that has been with his family for centuries. 

 He had the town participate in the celebrations, as he did 

 his family and close friends. 

 Tazia-makers, who live in Maheshwar 

 on the banks of Narbada, crafted paper chandeliers that 

 hung on branches of old trees, shedding muted light on all 

 the guests who ate a sit-down thaali dinner under 

 their leafy canopies. Two candles lit each table from beneath. 

 Women who belong to the town, who respect and venerate their 

 rulers even today, created patterns, using grain, raw rice 

 and dals, that spread their colour and beauty on 

 the grand steps of the ghats that rise out of the 

 river. 

 The grooms baraat stayed 

 in tents across the river and came by boat, at sunset, to 

 the ghats of this gem of a temple town, for the jaimala 

 and the wedding ceremony. It was real, true and, thankfully, 

 without a single false note. No superimpositions by modern 

 event managers!

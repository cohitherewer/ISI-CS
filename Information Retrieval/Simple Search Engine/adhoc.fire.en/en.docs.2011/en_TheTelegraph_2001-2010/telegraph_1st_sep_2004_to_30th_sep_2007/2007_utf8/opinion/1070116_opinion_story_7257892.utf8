 Letters to Editor

 Not the time to party

 Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjees observations on the violence indulged in by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) are very accurate (Kiss of death, Jan 10). As Mukherjee has pointed out, there is indeed a propensity on the part of the CPI(M) to substitute the party for the government. If investors are to have faith in the state administration, they must be assured that the government will remain neutral on the questions of land acquisition, industrial disputes and problems about law and order. The principal duty of the state government is to ensure that law and order is maintained, and that the party or group in power does not hijack or violate the law. Mukherjee is also right about the fact that faith in the administration, an essential ingredient for investment, has been shaken. The chief ministers efforts to industrialize West Bengal are laudable but recent events have shown that he does not have full control over the machinery he has been put in charge of. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.K. Bhagat, Calcutta 

 Sir It is true that Nandigram is not the first instance of the CPI(M) cadre using violence against the partys opponents. Although the violent agitations against the Tata project in Singur and the special economic zone in Nandigram had little to do with political and economic ideology, the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, must realize that industrialization cannot happen in the face of mass discontent. Bhattacharjee has recently pledged to go slow on land acquisition. But the government must learn to be patient as well as transparent. For any country to achieve a sustained economic growth, its political parties must stop exploiting public sentiments for vote-bank politics. When diverse elements such as the Jamat-e-Ulema-Hind, the Maoists, the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Congress and the Trinamool Congress have joined forces against the proposed industrialization projects, the West Bengal government would do well to behave in a more responsible manner. Bhattacharjee must show that he means business by taking the errant policemen and his violent comrades to task. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir The two very significant questions that have been raised by Rudrangshu Mukherjee in his article, Kiss of death, pertain to the legacies Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee inherited from his predecessor. Whatever may be his periodic declarations of intent, Bhattacharjee has not been able, during his six-year tenure, to come to terms with them. The CPI(M) has become synonymous with violence over the years. Dissent has no place in the partys brand of parliamentary democracy. It leads a coalition of parties, but refuses to respect the multiple views. Nandigram is the latest instance of its expertise in unleashing terror to crush opposition. In this one-sided game, the higher bureaucracy and the police act as part of the CPI(M) team.

 But Bhattacharjee had assumed office in 2000, generating tremendous expectations, and with an overwhelming fund of goodwill. After Nandigram, I must say that all my expectations have been belied. The tradition of sycophancy that was the hallmark of the bureaucratic and police establishments of the late Sixties is still faithfully followed. So why blame only the comrades, when the police and civil servants are just as culpable? 

 Yours faithfully,

Debaki Nandan Mandal, Calcutta

 Sir A party cadre can take the law into their own hands only when the party is a law unto itself. In a situation where, as Rudrangshu Mukherjee has pointed out, the difference between government and party is blurred, the cadre are accountable not to the State, but to their political mentors. And they are always eager to seize the fruits of development by resorting to terror under official patronage. Nandigram was just an opportunity which was well-exploited. After the annihilation of all opposition and, along with it, the potential of the state, the state will finally witness peace, but of a kind that reigns in a graveyard. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir The Nandigram violence was the handiwork of people who do not want West Bengal to industrialize and prosper. The course of action was pre-planned. The opposition parties will continue to obstruct development, be it Nandigram or Singur. They are not concerned about the plight of poor peasants but about the rural vote bank, so far the CPI(M)s stronghold. The farmers are mere hapless scapegoats. The former chief minister, Jyoti Basu, was criticized by the opposition for failing to woo industrialists. Now that the present chief minister is somewhat successful in that task, the opposition should praise his efforts. Instead, they are baying for his blood on some silly pretext of transfer of agricultural land for industry. With such an opposition and a history of the Centres non-cooperation, how will the state develop?

 Yours faithfully,

Prabir K. Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir It goes without saying that Bengals, and the lefts, past has now come back to haunt their present. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is the prisoner of his own, and the CPI(M)s, history. No matter how desperately he tries to undo the damage, he and his party are caught in a fatal embrace. For nearly three decades, the left has pushed industry out of West Bengal, because it helped them establish their trade-union raj. Now industry is the buzzword, and the cadre have been asked to facilitate industrialization at any cost. Hence the organized violence at the first hint of trouble. Is this the real picture of the reformed left? 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashim Banerjee, Calcutta

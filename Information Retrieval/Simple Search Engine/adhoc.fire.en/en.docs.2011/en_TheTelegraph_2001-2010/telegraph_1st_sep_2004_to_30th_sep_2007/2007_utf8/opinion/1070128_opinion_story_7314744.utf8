The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 First day, first show

 Sir It is interesting to note the tactics Bollywood employs to market Hindi films aggressively. Movies are now covered extensively by the media to attract public attention even before they are released. The idea is to generate an interest in viewers minds so that they rush to the theatres without even bothering to check the quality of the movie. Earlier, people would go and watch a film after reading a review. Today, this has changed. The real loser happens to be the film critic whose work is now of academic interest only.

 Yours faithfully,

 Srikanta Bhattacharjee,

 In the dark

 Not within reach 

Sir The tug of war between Nimbus Communications and Prasar Bharati resulted in cricket fans being denied the opportunity to watch the India-West Indies one-day match in Nagpur (DD cricket deal no-balled, Jan 21). Tussles between private channels and the public broadcaster have become a routine affair, every time a cricket series is held in India. After a round of mudslinging, the matter inevitably gets referred to the court, which then provides a temporary solution. It is surprising to note that private television channels and the government authorities can never reach an agreement before the commencement of a series. As a result, fans are left at the mercy of the two adversaries, and they often have to do without live telecast. The Union minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, accused Nimbus of harbouring an unpatriotic attitude for refusing to share the signals with Doordarshan. This is unfair, considering the fact that the bidding for telecast rights is conducted in the open, much before an event takes place, and the highest bidder walks away with the telecast rights after a fair competition. Hence, if a private bidder wishes to share the telecast rights with another broadcaster on its own terms, there should not be any problems with it. In this case, since Nimbus won the exclusive rights to telecast all BCCI-organized matches in India till 2010, it is only fair that Prasar Bharati complies with the demands of the channel.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The entire fiasco over the telecast rights of Indias home series against the West Indies exposes the greediness of both Nimbus Communications, the private network that has won the rights of exclusive coverage, and the Board of Control for Cricket in India. 

 The BCCI has always stated that it is serious about promoting and developing the game at the grass roots. One would like to know exactly how the board is thinking of achieving this goal at a time when over 90 per cent of the population is being deprived of watching the matches live? Before offering the exclusive rights to Nimbus, the board should have ensured that the holder of these rights would not be able to drive hard bargains. In a country where cricket is considered a religion, the current imbroglio is bound to dent the popularity of the game.

 Yours faithfully,

Arnab Sarkar,

 Sir Cricket fans across the country missed the opportunity to watch live Indias opening match against Brian Laras men. As far as I am concerned, the BCCI should shoulder the blame for this debacle. After all, Nimbus had paid an enormous sum to win telecast rights for all BCCI-sponsored games to be played in India till 2010. What prevented the board from putting a clause in the contract, which would have ensured that the channel provides live action to all the homes in the country? All that the cricket board is concerned about is earning revenues, even if it means depriving cricket lovers of the happenings on field. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Kumar Ghosh,

Calcutta

 THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF PUFFED RICE

 The Table is Laid: The Oxford Anthology of South Asian Food Writing Edited by John Thieme and Ira Raja, Rs 595

When we were young and reading Shahaj Path, I wanted to grow up and serve a powerful zamindar-type of man, so that I could, like Akram in the Shahaj Path story, go on hunting trips and eat chatni with ruti (chatni being my favourite food at age three). It struck me only much later and after several revisions of my palate that Shaktibabu, Akrams zamindar-type master, eats the real feast of luchi, alur dam and pathar mangsho. There was a further revelation. When the master and servant lose their way in the forest, a group of woodcutters take them to their modest home and feed them both of them chnire, goats milk and honey. Fallen on adverse times and among innocent forest-dwellers, the differences of station are temporarily erased. 

 Food is political. All possible forms of power-games are played out through the eating, cooking, serving, feeding, selling and wasting of food, not to forget the craving for it. A.K. Ramanujans essay, Food for Thought: Towards an Anthology of Hindu Food-images, which really works as an umbrella piece for this anthology, translates from the Taittiriya Upanishad: From food, from food/ creatures, all creatures/ come to be// Gorging, disgorging/ beings come/ to be// By food they live,/ In food they move,/ into food they pass//And what eats is eaten:/ and whats eaten, eats/ in turn. 

 For Ramanujan, food as metaphor brings together the home and the temple. In the former, the orthodox wife eats in the unwashed plate of the husband to express her devotion; in the latter, the leftovers of the food offered to god are received back and eaten by the worshipper as prasada. 

 A similar theme informs Vivan Sundarams installation, The Table is Laid (picture), which provides both the title and the cover of this book. Sundaram juxtaposes the Western meal table Germaine Greer calls it an altar with the Eastern practice of eating on the floor. The pristine white table is bereft of food, but underneath it are twelve leaf-plates laden with rice and an earthen bowl of curd, suggesting an Indian last supper, according to the editors, John Thieme and Ira Raja, with Christ and his disciples as conspicuously absent as food is from the table.

 The absence of food, forced rather than willed, is sometimes a greater reality in the Indian context than an excess of it. If Bijan Bhattacharyas Nabanna is about the man-made famine of 1943 in Bengal, human agency is writ just as large in the skipped meals of Pari (The Curse, Pratibha Ray) and Patoler Ma (the eponymous heroine of Chitrita Banerjees story). Needless to say, missing meals and going hungry (and still remaining invisible) are largely gendered experiences, captured best in Geetanjali Shrees Mai. But class too often colours the picture. Piya, the NRI heroine of The Hungry Tide (Amitav Ghosh), nibbles on protein bars to whet her appetite, but Kshenti of Bibhuti Bhushan Bandyopadhyays The Trellis cannot get enough of pui-and-shrimps chachchari. Latika in Narendranath Mitras A Drop of Milk spins a web of lies around a cup of milk she has drunk. Perumayee, in Githa Hariharans Gajar Halwa, quickly pops into her mouth the last stubborn bits of the carrots she has been asked to grate by her mistress.

 When women get greedy, they face the direst of consequences. In Vaikom Mohammed Basheers Poovan Bananas, Jameela Bibi, BA and wife of Abdul Khader Sahib (who is only half as educated), has a sudden longing for Poovan bananas. Braving inclement weather, her husband crosses the river, but the particular variety of fruit proves elusive. He gets oranges instead, but Jameela Bibi appreciates neither the act of love, nor her husbands labours. Then, Abdul Khader Sahib beats her and makes her eat the oranges thinking of them as Poovan bananas his heart breaking at the sight of his wifes tears. And the incident passes into the couples private joke as they grow old together, revealing the mysterious and enigmatic nature of human relationships. Ismat Chughtais The Rock is a more straightforward tale of cruelty, where a young and beautiful bride, hemmed in by a hundred strictures, overeats and sacrifices the slimness of her form so that her husband does not feel threatened. Soon enough, the husband falls for a slimmer, younger girl and leaves her. 

 But for worse cruelties, one must turn to the stories where food becomes a weapon with which to torture the aged and the infirm. There is endless fuss over Nibaran Chandras favourite dishes after he dies a neglected and unfed man (Nibaran Chandras Last Rites, Ashapurna Devi). In The Devoted Son, by Anita Desai, a fathers preferred foods are snatched away, one by one, by his devoted son, all in the name of concern for the old mans health.

 To read about Indian food in English is also to realize the alienating effect of the foreign language. It makes the ordinary daaler bora turn into unfamiliar lentil cakes, as Buddhadeva Bose pointed out in a delightful essay on Indian food, but cannot distinguish the fried nuggets from the sun-dried daaler bori.

 A number of poems by Dom Moraes, Nissim Ezekiel, Agha Shahid Ali and others are included in the anthology, but they tend to lose out to the short stories for no apparent fault of their own. Can a few works by Sri Lankan authors make the anthology adequately south Asian? What about contemporary Pakistan and Bangladesh? There are many from these countries who have greater claims on the anthology than V.S. Naipaul. Of the works included, the best translations have not always been selected (Bibhuti Bhushans story readily comes to mind). And surely Shashi Deshpandes story could not have been translated from Bengali?

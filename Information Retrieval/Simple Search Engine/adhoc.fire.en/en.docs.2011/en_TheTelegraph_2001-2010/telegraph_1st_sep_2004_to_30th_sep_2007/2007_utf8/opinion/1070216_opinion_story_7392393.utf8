 GOOD BIOGRAPHY OF A GOOD MAN

 Quiet dignity

 Leonard Woolf: A Life

 By Victoria Glendinning, Simon amp; Schuster, $ 25.75

 Leonard Woolf is conveniently known as Virginias husband. He should also be known as one of the worlds most devoted, patient and long-suffering spouses. It could not have been easy for him to live with Virginias moods, madness and proneness to suicide. Yet Leonard not only endured all this but loved her, cared for her and also pursued a highly successful career of his own, as a writer, as a journalist and as a left-of-centre figure in English public life.

 Victoria Glendinnings biography, well-researched and well-written, successfully captures the various facets of Leonards life from the tortured conjugal life to the Bloomsbury intellectual to the literary figure. She had the advantage, of course, to draw upon Leonards five-volume autobiography and his voluminous diaries. Moreover, all his close friends Lytton Strachey, John Maynard Keynes, E.M. Forster, T.S. Eliot have commanded the attention of very conscientious biographers. Glendinnings biography can easily be placed on the bookshelf next to Michael Holroyds volume on Strachey and Skidelskys three volumes on Keynes. Strachey, Keynes and Leonard Woolf are united not only in their lifelong friendship but also in the splendid biographies their lives have produced.

 Leonard Woolf was born into a London Jewish family. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge where he was elected to the secret and elitist society called The Apostles. It was here that he met Strachey and Keynes, who became his lifelong friends. They went on to form the set that came to be called the Bloomsbury Group. Leonard was bright and erudite but he did not do live up to his talents in Trinity. He joined the colonial service and went off to Ceylon. His writings on life in Ceylon were extraordinarily sensitive and among the best that he produced.

 He fell in love with Virginia when he was back in London on furlough. They married and he resigned from his job to be with her. He lived off his earnings from journalism and writing. He also set up with Virginia the Hogarth Press, which operated out of their house. One thing that remains amazing is the amount of work that Leonard Woolf did despite the time and the emotion he invested in looking after Virginia.

 Glendinnings book is in the best traditions of narrative biography. There is no attempt to theorize or to render some psychological explanation to her subjects life and actions. There is also no attempt to gloss over Leonards faults and foibles. Readers are in Glendinnings debt for having provided for the first time Leonard Woolf, the whole man.

 The writing is austere but lucid, exactly as Leonard himself would have liked it. The biography also has the quiet dignity that Leonard himself commanded right till the very end.

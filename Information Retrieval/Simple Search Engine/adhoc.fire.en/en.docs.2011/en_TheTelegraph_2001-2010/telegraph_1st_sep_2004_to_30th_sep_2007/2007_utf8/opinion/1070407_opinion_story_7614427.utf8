 UNSETTLING BODIES

 Aveek Sen

 Visual Arts 

 Reality Bytes (CIMA Gallery, until April 12) presents recent paintings by Uday Mondal, Debraj Goswami and Abir Karmakar. All three artists were born in the mid-Seventies, graduated from Rabindra Bharati University in Calcutta, and then went on to M.S. University in Baroda for their post-graduate work. All three are sophisticated, metropolitan artists, primarily interested in the depiction of the human body in interior and fantasy spaces, placed in relation to other objects. They paint in realistic idioms, which are reflective as well as cosmopolitan. Their large canvases ask for slow, contemplative viewing. Avoiding cyber-age clichs (hence the shows title is somewhat misleading), their individual modernities use traditional technical and figurative skills to produce forms of self-reflexivity and inwardness that combine extravagance and restraint, aggressive colouring and a more quietly disconcerting quality.

 Uday Mondals theatre of the modern is the city apartment with its empty walls, in which women cohabit with glass-topped tables, TVs, sofas, swing doors and windows that frame the night outside. The glass top of the coffee-table in Bear on the Glass (picture) is a hard, receding plane of glazed yellow, pushing the two seated women to the margins of the canvas, their faces partially obscured by the same yellow, violently clashing with the red and blue of their clothes. Their upper-middle-class faces are impenetrable, as in a photograph, like the splashed-over face of the seated, but restless, woman in Is She Relaxing-2? 

 The woman in The View Outside the Window, all flesh-pink and scarlet, flops on a garish, blue-green sofa in a garish, blue-green room, surrounded by the partially-visible darkness outside the windows behind her. The room has a crazy, upward tilt, while the womans head tilts sideways too, straining her neck, as if she has just been slapped hard by colour; her right leg is blurred in swinging, red-lined motion. The edgy, but flopped-out dynamism of her body is in rhythm with the loudness of the colours that surround and form her. Mondals spacious canvases create the sense of a nervous energy, not incapable of poise, that is essential to the urban modernity of his female subjects in their watermelon-red pants, or taking Hockney-esque showers with the bathroom door open, silently watched from a distance by a switched-off TV, her life indoors sliced up by panels of pure colour.

 Debraj Goswamis work is watched over by the figure of Rodins Thinker as if the paintings elaborate the Surrealist, randomly allusive, collage-like internal universe of that iconic figure, who embodies all the dichotomies of silent, massively fleshed-in thought. Gandhipin places the Mahatma stilted-up on the guard of a gigantic safety-pin, his stick one of its arms inside the hollowed-out outline of the Thinker. The entire pin-Gandhi-Thinker complex is placed on a sharply painted, intriguingly pulled-out drawer, the top of which is full of human finger-stubs pointing upwards, with pieces of string twined around them. This is the bizarre, but coldly illuminated world of De Chirico, Ernst, Magritte and Dal, etched within pure darkness, where figures and objects connect in some enigmatic, but insanely precise logic that the reflective viewer recognizes but does not understand rationally. It is when such hybrid worlds try to allegorize oversimplified ideas as in Goswamis The Birth of Proletariat, with its obvious allusion to Michelangelos Creation of Man that the painting becomes verbose in a rather un-paintinglike manner.

 There is a profoundly disconcerting quietness about Abir Karmakars two series of oils on canvas (a triptych and a set of four) called In the Old Fashioned Way -1 and 2. These are, perhaps, the most accomplished works in this show, combining immense skill with intellectual distinction. These are massive self-portraits done in the old-fashioned manner of Renaissance and Baroque female nudes, including such pieces of sculpture as the Michelangelo Captives, those beautiful, unfinished men trapped in marble. (Sovon Som is quite wrong to claim, in his catalogue essay, that the Renaissance and Reformation abhorred male-nudity.) The unabashedly Rubensian fleshiness, and the unflinching coldness of the subjects attitude, lit by a reddish-yellow glow heightened by the tacky red of the rug on the sofa, create an atmosphere of transfigured sleaze that troubles the viewers notions of respectable Indian masculinity. Gender, in these portraits, becomes a matter of consciously stylized projection and performance, expressed through a skilfully detailed nakedness that takes the viewer beyond the expected cultural pleasures and meanings of nudity. 

 In the earlier, and more cluttered, series by Karmakar From My Photo Album (2005) and Interiors (2006) the artists painted persona had been split into two men, one obviously masculine and the other subtly cross-dressed. Together, they played out elusive, light-hearted games of doubling and fluidity. This split-up androgyny is internalized, united and absorbed within a single male body in Karmakars latest works. The clutter around this body is also replaced by just a tall mirror and a framed picture on the wall, placed in the claustrophobic corner of a room. The thighs, knees, feet or buttocks of the foreshortened body obtrude into the viewers space, distancing the face. Its tired, cold eyes challenge and unsettle, but refuse to seduce.

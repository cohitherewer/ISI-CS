 So little 

to bring good cheer

 Sreyashi Dastidar

 MUSIC

 A host of Rabindrasangeet singers and dancers were brought together by Brotee in its annual programme at G.D. Birla Sabhagar on March 25. The songs and dances were organized around the theme, Utsaber Anginay Rabindranath (loosely, Rabindranath and Festivity), the brainchild of Apala Basu. But poor coordination seemed to haunt the entire show, be it in the choral songs or the dances. When a few among a handful of male voices chose to go silent while repeating an antara, (baje alo baje o bhai in Alo amar alo ogo) the result was rather unfortunate. Songs like Dharanir gaganer milaner chhande betrayed the lack of sufficient rehearsal, with singers joining in and trailing off at will. And what were a group of young boys in fez caps, fluttering handkerchiefs, doing in the dance accompanying the song?

 The general sloppiness seemed to have infected the soloists as well. Pubali Debnath was completely off-key in Morubijayer ketan udao, while even a consistent performer like Aniruddha Sinha sounded uncomfortable in the higher octave in Aloy alokmoy. Swastika Mukhopadhyay made up for much of the disappointment with her note-perfect rendition of Eto alo jaliyechho, as did Debashish Raychaudhuri, Sankar Ganguly and the group of children under them, with their endearing little item on Sarat (autumn).

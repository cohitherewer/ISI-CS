The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WHAT IS THE REAL STORY? 

 Malvika Singh

 MALA FIDE

 Television channels have gone 

 on and on about Sanjay Dutt and whether his sentence is 

 too hard or too soft (or god knows what else). They have 

 reached no conclusion on this rather unnecessary debate, 

 only the same shots are being repeated over and over again. 

 This is a great way of saving camera expenses. Having spent 

 sixteen months in jail for this crime, the young man, now 

 a middle-aged adult, must have gone through some character 

 change. Why havent we heard more about that, about the 

 effect his earlier sentence had on his person, or about 

 whether he has dissociated himself from the people he was 

 once in cohorts with or what they had wanted from him? Or, 

 more plainly, something about his personal quirks and habits? 

 Why is news always so utterly dull, pedestrian and repetitive? 

 The time spent on Sanjay Dutt 

 could have been used in the celebration of another young 

 man, a journalist who reports on the real India. He has 

 got the Magsaysay award this year but was just about mentioned, 

 with seeming reluctance by fellow journalists who have failed 

 the test, on the moving ticker below the television screen. 

 Juxtaposed with it was the lead story of a book launch. 

 It told the story of the unreal India, it made for a sexy 

 story, and therefore became the national lead story of the 

 day! The other story that has overwhelmed us is about the 

 awards that a major newspaper had given a bunch of journalists 

 and anchors for their talk shows in the carefully crafted 

 studios in Delhi and, occasionally, in other metropolitan 

 cities. Why then was there no space in that newspaper and 

 in the news channels for P. Sainath? 

 Selling lies

 Could it be because Sainath reveals 

 the truth, shows the reality for what it is and does not 

 wrap it up in personalized editorializing? Is it because 

 he slogs and is not part of the party circuit, the cocktails 

 and stand-up dinners with their predictable guest lists 

 made up of the well-known and well-heeled? Or, is it because 

 truth does not sell? 

 Have our media become a captive 

 of the marketing crew, the underworld of this profession? 

 Where are the intellectuals? Where are the men and women 

 who should be influencing policy and perceptions correctly 

 and intelligently in an exciting and attractive manner? 

 Where is that sharp interview? Where is the fearlessness 

 that comes from truth? Where are the real stories, not the 

 ones on murders and loot cases that have been bungled by 

 the police, the judiciary and the State? 

 Bizarre act

 Sensationalism can be boring if 

 it is indulged in all the time. It takes on the form of 

 fantasy, a movie script, and not something that is part 

 of real life. It becomes, increasingly, a flight of the 

 imagination where reputations are torn apart because of 

 personal and political vendetta. No extra reading, studying 

 the many dimensions of a story, ferreting around and unearthing 

 new and hidden pieces of information seem to happen as press 

 handouts make life easy for the uninformed. Superficial 

 knowledged, skimming of the surface, insulting the viewer 

 and so on are all that these news programmes are beginning 

 to do more and more. 

 The shrieking star performers 

 who think they are on some political manch, addressing 

 a vast congregation called India, are defying the very premise 

 and strength of the small screen the private, one-to-one 

 communication that television brings into the lives of us 

 all. Yelling is not the way. A gentle and nuanced conversation 

 is what should come across to us in the privacy of our homes. 

 Public rostrums and the big screen are for declamations. 

 I often wonder if it is an overblown ego that compels our 

 television stars to perform in this bizarre manner.

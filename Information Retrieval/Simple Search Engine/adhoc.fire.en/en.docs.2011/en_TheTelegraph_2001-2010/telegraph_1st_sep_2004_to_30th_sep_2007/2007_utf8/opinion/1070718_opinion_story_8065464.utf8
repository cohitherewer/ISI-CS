 Letters to Editor

 No favours

Strike hard

 Sir After killing about 23 security personnel in Chattisgarh, Maoists have struck close to Visakhapatnam and blown up an electricity sub-station, a guest house and a Doordarshan tower (Maoists blow up power unit, July 13). First and foremost, such violence exposes the hollowness of the Maoist ideology. The rebels are harming the poor tribals and villagers more than they are harming anybody else. Second, the attacks reveal the thorough incompetence of the people responsible for security. The death of two dozen security personnel and the subsequent incident at Chintapalli show how unprepared the security agencies are in thwarting a movement that is decades-old. Apathy and lack of coordination between the Central and state governments allow Naxalite violence to rage on. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Apparently, there is evidence to prove that Maoists are resorting to large-scale operations in India and getting active support from their comrades in Nepal (Nepal hint in strike, July 12). The change of strategy on the part of the rebels should be obvious. The Dantewada incident in Chattisgarh, where security personnel were lured into a trap and 23 of them were shot dead, shows that the Naxalites are not resorting to ambushes and their old hit-and-run tactics anymore. The scale and area of Maoist operations are expanding. And yet the government cannot decide how these criminals should be classified in the security jargon. The United Progressive Alliance seems to be especially hesitant in bringing the Maoists to book despite the prime minister expressing alarm at the deteriorating situation. But time is fast running out. Manmohan Singh and his men ought to get their act together.

 Sir The editorial, Into a trap (July 12), merely reiterates the standard government line on the Naxalite problem. The Maoist menace has its roots in socio-economic deprivation and is not a law and order problem, as the government would have us believe. Since the Centre and states are not too keen on resolving these socio-economic issues, they seek to portray the Naxalite problem as a security threat. The success of the Maoist movement doubtlessly proves that democracy has not succeeded in India. Over the last sixty years, the Indian State has failed to improve its human development index. Funds meant for development are quietly siphoned off with the connivance of government employees. Besides, in areas affected by Maoism, movements like the Salwa Judum have compounded the problem. The deprived now realize that polite requests for the most basic amenities of life invariably fall on deaf ears. Death from starvation and disease is routine, and does not affect the administration. Hence, these people have resorted to violence to secure their just demands. 

 If the UPA is desperate to solve the problem, its chairperson, along with the Union home minister, should begin an open dialogue with the Maoist leaders of the affected states. The Centre should then heed Chanakyas advice: that is, making the Maoists themselves take on the task of development with government assistance. Unless the Maoists have a share in the democratic polity of these areas, there will be further violence.

 Without favour

 Sir Television-viewers have justly resented the governments proposal for an annual licence fee for TV sets to subsidize the public broadcaster, Prasar Bharati (New TV tax stares at viewers, July 11). After more than a decade-and-a-half of economic liberalization, Prasar Bharati cannot be shown favours any longer. The government broadcaster persists with its primitive method of broadcasting while the private channels use satellite transmission. Prasar Bharati is better advised to upgrade its technology or wrap up its operations altogether. In either case, it would reduce expenditure and release the much-needed radio frequency spectrum for mobile phones. 

 Yours faithfully,P.J. Joglekar, 

 Thane

 Sir The government decision, now shelved, to introduce a tax on TV sets to finance Prasar Bharati was ridiculous to begin with (Not worth it, July 13). Hardly anybody watches the Doordarshan channels these days. The government should, therefore, make Doordarshans content more attractive to viewers and use the advertising revenue to sustain Prasar Bharati. If the state broadcaster does not consider this a viable option, then it should quietly exit the market. 

 Yours faithfully, Kalyan Ghosh,

 Danger ahead

 Sir The underpass of Dum Dum Road has been a nightmare for the last two months, thanks to the ongoing repair work. On an average, a vehicle takes close to an hour to negotiate its way through the place. Students of Cossipore English School, Kendriya Vidyalaya and other schools in the neighbourhood often cannot reach their schools in time. These educational institutions should thus show some consideration for the late-comers. If pressured, students and their guardians may take unnecessary risks. What is more important, however, is that the authorities should finish the maintenance work as soon as possible. 

 Yours faithfully,Subhasis Choudhury,

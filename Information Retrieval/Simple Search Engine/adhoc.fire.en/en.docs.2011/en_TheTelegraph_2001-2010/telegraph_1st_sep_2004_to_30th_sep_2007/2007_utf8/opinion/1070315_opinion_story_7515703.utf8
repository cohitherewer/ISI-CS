The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WANTED: FOREIGN AID 

 Sudipta Bhattacharjee

 FIFTH COLUMN 

 Manipuris have had several reasons 

 to take umbrage. Contrary to their expectations, the anti-incumbency 

 factor played truant during the elections. The Congress 

 retained power and Okram Ibobi Singh was sworn in for a 

 second consecutive term earlier this month. That put paid 

 to hopes of a repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) 

 Act, although the issue had been a pivotal point on which 

 the assembly poll campaign revolved.

 Then came the news that Irom Sharmila, 

 who has been on a hunger strike against the AFSPA since 

 November 2000, was back in custody in Imphal. She had been 

 smuggled out to Delhi in October last year to draw national, 

 if not global, attention to her campaign. In December 2006, 

 the prime minister said that the law would be made more 

 humane, but Sharmila rejected the offer and continued 

 her fast.

 Yet, last weekend, when the United 

 Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 

 advocated that the draconian legislation of 1958 be replaced 

 with a more humane act, there was jubilation over this 

 moral victory. The credence given to the opinions of foreign 

 agencies, including toothless ones under the UN, possibly 

 stems from the fact that those who spearhead these campaigns 

 do little to alleviate the sense of alienation induced in 

 the residents of the North-east by a nonchalant Centre. 

 In its Request for adoption of 

 a decision under the urgent action/early warning procedure 

 in connection with violation of indigenous peoples rights 

 in Northeast India, the United NGOs Mission, Manipur, cited 

 systematic and pervasive racial discrimination against 

 the indigenous peoples of the region. It alleged that the 

 AFSPA had led to gross violations of indigenous peoples 

 basic human rightswhile the perpetrators enjoy de jure 

 impunity. The CERD met in Geneva last month and deliberated 

 on this plea, sent in October, around the same time that 

 Sharmila escaped to Delhi.

 Cycle of violence

 Given the academic structure of 

 the petition to the UN body, it is evident that the activists 

 are conversant with procedural formalities of organizations 

 like Amnesty International and the relevant wings of the 

 UN. What is surprising is that the NGOs hoped that these 

 agencies would actually coerce Delhi into complying with 

 the demand for a repeal. 

 They did, of course, have the 

 grace to point out that it is not only the Indian armed 

 forces that are at fault. We wish to emphasize that this 

 (focus on the acts and omissions of India) in no way minimizes 

 the role and responsibility of the armed opposition groups 

 in the Northeast for the longstanding violence that has 

 dominated the regions daily life for generations. These 

 groups contribute to the cycle of violence and human rights 

 abuses, said the request to CERD.

 This recognition of multiple actors 

 in the theatre of violence makes the demand for a repeal 

 of the AFSPA redundant. If militant outfits take the law 

 into their own hands in the name of moral policing, how 

 can the security of the citizens be guaranteed? In Manipur 

 itself, there are many recent instances of youths being 

 executed by insurgents for alleged drug abuse, or officials 

 and politicians being shot for corruption.

 Would it not be more practical 

 to coordinate effectively and create a connecting space 

 with the security forces than constantly projecting them 

 as perpetrators of crimes? A key strategy would be to implement 

 the concept of just peace, which, in conflict-resolution 

 parlance, implies that peace without justice cannot be sustained. 

 Instead of running to global agencies that are alien to 

 the local context, it is time we honed our relational skills 

 for troubleshooting in order to put an end to this endless 

 cycle of victimijzation.

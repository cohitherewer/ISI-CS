 Break from the past

 Sir The Supreme Court order, staying 27 per cent reservations for the other backward classes in higher education, is a blow to the United Progressive Alliance government (Blow to OBC entry this year, March 30). The apex court has rightly observed that the 1931 census cannot be a yardstick for the apportioning of quotas for the lower castes today. The court is also correct in observing that nowhere in the world is positive discrimination such a permanent feature of State action. Quotas have consolidated caste divisions in society. Rapid urbanization and inter-caste marriages seem to have made politicians desperate to preserve social divisions and thus serve their vested interests. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir The fact that the Supreme Courts stay order on reservations for OBCs has come during the tenure of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, a Dalit, is significant. The chief justice himself bears the stigma of being constantly branded as the first Dalit in the post. Balakrishnan has risen to eminence because of his merit. Therefore, it is unfair to claim that all the lower castes are backward. The apex courts order should be read as an indictment of the games politicians play for securing votes, and the tendency of social groups to claim backward caste status in order to get the benefits.

 Yours faithfully,

G.D. Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir The Supreme Courts intervention in decisions taken by the legislature should be an exception rather than the rule. It reflects poorly on the current leadership, which is unable, or unwilling, to decide matters with the right perspective in mind. The competition among castes for getting privileges on the basis of their backward status is a blot on the Indian polity sixty years after independence. This socio-political tragedy demonstrates the inability of the administration to lift the standards of the underprivileged.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The apex court is right in arguing that the politics of division weakens the social fabric. But is it not equally true that the lower castes are backward because of socio-economic exploitation? Reservations is one way to redress the balance. In the light of the latest ruling, one is tempted to ask why then did the judiciary accept many of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, which were also based on the 1931 census?

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir If the 1931 census can form the basis for reservations for the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes, why is it being rejected in case of the OBCs? In India, communities queue up to be branded as backward because nowhere else in the world does there exist a caste system that fosters perpetual hatred and inequality. Even if the stay order is annulled, it will not help OBC students from losing an academic year. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Calcutta 

 Sir Thousands of students across India have heaved a sigh of relief following the apex courts stay order. Every effort should be made for the uplift of the downtrodden, but it would be unfair and unjust to do so by destroying the very framework that would build and sustain equality and development. Unless the government looks at solutions beyond quotas, social engineering will be a disaster in India.

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore

 Sir Reservations had been made a provision in the Constitution with the hope that caste discrimination would end soon. Politicians today misuse the provision for electoral gains. Instead of reservations, the government should focus on primary education and affordable healthcare for all. Elementary education alone can equip students from the reserved categories for the demanding curricula of the IITs and IIMs. Quotas are aimed not at liberating the backward castes, but at keeping them in perpetual bondage. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir The Supreme Court has made a commonsensical point that a 76-year-old census is hopelessly outdated today. The demography changes with time and economic progress. A group of people designated to be backward cannot perpetually remain so. Welfare States call for affirmative action but not at the expense of all those who are left out of its ambit. The ruling is equally significant because the court has voiced its concern about the fate of general category students if quotas are to continue. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshay, Secunderabad

 Sir The stay order has been described as an interim arrangement and there is no doubt that the prescribed quotas will be implemented sometime in the near future. The political community is hopeful that the court will reconsider its order. Besides, given the political pressure that has been generated in favour of reservations, it is doubtful whether the stay order will hold. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir Those who desperately need affirmative action do not really bother about the countrys showcase management and technical schools. They are busy making both ends meet. Only the creamy layers of the backward castes have consistently profited from Indias reverse discrimination. The apex courts stay order is a warning to these opportunists and also to politicians focused on the forthcoming assembly elections. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

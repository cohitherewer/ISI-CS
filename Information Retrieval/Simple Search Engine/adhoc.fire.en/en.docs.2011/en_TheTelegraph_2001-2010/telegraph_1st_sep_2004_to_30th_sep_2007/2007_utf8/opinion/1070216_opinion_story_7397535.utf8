The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FLOWING AGAIN

 Subcontinental river disputes, like the rivers themselves, tend to go on for ever. So it took 16 years, the World Bank, and its neutral expert for India and Pakistan to come very close to settling matters regarding the use of the river Chenab. The building of the Baglihar dam the 450 MW hydel project which India had started constructing on the Chenab was almost halfway through when Pakistan objected to its design, invoking the Indus Water Treaty of 1960. Over the years, as the Kashmir conflict became grimmer, the Baglihar dispute got impossibly politicized at both the Indian and the Pakistani ends. It was Pakistan which initiated the World Banks arbitration, and Mr Raymond Lafitte was appointed by the Bank as a neutral expert. At the end of an eminently civilized process of inquiry and mediation, Mr Lafitte has now awarded a verdict on the issue, which is a model of technologically sensible diplomacy. The award was handed to the two countries in that haven of neutrality, Switzerland, and each country has lauded Mr Lafittes fairness to its own demands. Each thinks that it has won, which is perhaps the best sign of consummate diplomacy. Instead of treating it as a political conflict, Mr Lafitte has focussed on purely technological issues, balancing the various elements of his corrective verdict so that both countries have to accept victory as well as compromise. 

 However, there are still some rumblings in the Pakistani political establishment. But the countrys own media, and the people most directly affected by its water politics, have urged its politicians to overcome their lower riparian alarmism and get on with what Mr Lafittes verdict asks both countries to do. If this happens, then India hopes to finish building the dam in another year, and the greatest beneficiary of the project would be the hapless state of Jammu and Kashmir, rich with the resources of power but hindered by its terrible history to make proper use of them. Mr Lafittes civilized, scrupulous, efficient and prompt dealing of the matter, and its positive outcome, are important milestones in the dialogue between the two countries, and in the fate of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Treaties are also historical documents and must adapt to technological progress, as Mr Lafittes handling of the Indus Water Treaty has shown. Water and power are too basic to human survival for chauvinistic politicking.

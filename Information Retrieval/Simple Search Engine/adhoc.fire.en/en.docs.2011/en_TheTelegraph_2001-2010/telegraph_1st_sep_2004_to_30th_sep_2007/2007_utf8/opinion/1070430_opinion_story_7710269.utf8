The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IN A TRILLION

 It is unlikely to be made, for the current Indian prime minister is less given to grand flourishes. But it is an occasion for another Tryst with Destiny speech. At midnight on August 14, 1947, Jawaharlal Nehru said to the newly awakened nation, We end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future? The children of free India can tell him that they were not always so brave or wise as they should have been, but they did a few things right, and are now on their way to enjoying a few fruits of their freedom. For on April 26, Credit Suisse declared that Indias gross domestic product had crossed a trillion dollars.

 True, it was only about $870 billion only three months ago; since then, the rupee has appreciated by about 15 per cent. The increase is entirely in valuation; it is not as if Indians have got 15 per cent richer in 90 days. Dollars are not the best measure, for one cannot spend dollars here. In rupees, Indias GDP is 41 trillion. And that is at current prices, which are many times higher than those paid by Nehru. In terms of the rupee he knew, our GDP is probably no more than Rs 50 thousand crore. Still, it is about 15 times higher than it was in his time; even after taking out the effect of higher population, it is perhaps five times higher.

 That total includes the tanks being built in Avadi and the 40-story mansion being built for Mukesh Ambani. It encompasses the income of the Bachchan trinity father, son and daughter-in-law. As is usual with incomes, probably a quarter of the people take three-quarters, leaving a quarter for the other three-quarters. The unending dirges about the poor that politicians from the prime minister down sing are not irrelevant; and it is in the politicians interest that the song should never cease. Still, today, most Indians have footwear, most can afford a bicycle, a high proportion have watches, and a surprising number amuse themselves with Bollywoodiana served out on television. These changes may not be everyones idea of enrichment; but it is the consumers, and if they prefer Mallika Sherawat to Ms Brinda Karat, who is one to complain? If democracy has any meaning, it must mean choice not only of rulers, but also of movie moguls. Who knows what Indians will take to heart in the next 60 years? The way the cost of broadband is tumbling, they may well take to finding boyfriends and girlfriends on the internet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 GROW UP

 Apart from proving to be a hard lesson for the Indian team, the World Cup should also make the entire nation reflect on the nature and consequences of its love for the game. Why is it that cricket brings out the most infantile in Indians? And why is it that for an alarmingly large number of adults (mostly male) in this country, absorption in cricket is at the expense of interest in almost everything else apart from, perhaps, sex and the Sensex? A cricket-lover used, once, to be a well-rounded and interesting human being urbane, humorous and with a well-furnished mind whose love for the game was part of an overall interest in books, ideas, people and the world. He is now a cross between a bore and a boor, capable of feeling or talking passionately about almost nothing else, and equally incapable of any balanced and mature expression of this passion. 

 Cricketers houses, or restaurants owned by them, have to be kept well-guarded. Mock funerals in Varanasi, effigy-burning in Delhi, poster-slapping in Ahmedabad, a fatal heart-attack in Hyderabad, wife-beating followed by a double-suicide in Nadia this is a kind of crazy and uncharming excess that should deeply worry law-keepers, psychiatrists, sociologists and patriots, or ordinary, sensible people generally concerned about contemporary Indian society and culture. These same enthusiasts would live through most other forms of human distress and dismay road accidents, fake killings, starvation deaths or genocide with perfect indifference or equanimity. But a single defeat or disappointment in the game, and all hell breaks loose, as if something like a sense of proportion is a humanly unrealizable ideal. The heroes of the Indian team are now being put down as having traded their skills for pelf and popularity. But the culture of endorsements thrives on precisely this collective loss of judgment on the part of the people. If these Indians want to watch mature cricket, they must themselves grow up first.

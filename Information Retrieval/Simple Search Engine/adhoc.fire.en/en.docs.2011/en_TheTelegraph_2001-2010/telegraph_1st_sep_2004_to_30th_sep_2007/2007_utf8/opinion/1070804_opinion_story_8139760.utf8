 Yesterday once more

 Sir Richard Branson may have reasons to feel proud about being a member of the mile-high club (Unfasten your belts, please, July 31). But does he know that the people of my generation had had their share of fun too, inside the coups of the Indian Railways? In our time, the fun of a holiday started much before arriving at the destination. The coups were spacious enough for amorous exchanges as well. It is a pity that the Railways have done away with them. Their reintroduction would certainly help the Railways ward off competition from airlines. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Tapan Pal,

 Playing hard

 Sir The victory over England in the second Test at Trent Bridge would surely lift the morale of the Indian cricket team (Team India survive a mild tremor, Aug 2). After all, the Indians had escaped by the skin of their teeth in the first Test at Lords where play was called off because of inclement weather with England needing one wicket to win. However, in the second Test, the Indians were in command from the first day. The credit for this win should go to a number of individuals Zaheer Khan, for his aggressive bowling, as well as players such as Dinesh Karthik, Wasim Jaffer, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly for their heroics with the bat. 

 There are areas of concern that need to be addressed by the team management before the commencement of the third Test. For instance, the bowling coach, Venkatesh Prasad needs to sit down with S. Sreesanth to mend his wayward bowling. What was encouraging is that India succeeded in winning the match without a coach. Hopefully, the Indian players would be able to retain their intensity and go on to win the series at the Oval.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir England must be blaming their defeat at Trent Bridge on the jelly beans episode. Reportedly, when Zaheer Khan came out to bat during Indias first innings, an English fielder tried to get under Khans skin by throwing jellybeans on to the pitch. The culprit must be regretting his move now. An infuriated Khan bowled fast and furiously and won the match for India. The leftarm bowler should be considered a role model by the countrys youth as well as by young players in the Indian team. It is a pity to note that while senior players such as Khan behave in an impeccable manner, juniors often get carried away and resort to sledging and other forms of intimidating behaviour. Such responses are unacceptable as it exposes the ugly side of cricket. Young players like Sreesanth should realize that they are not merely cricketers but also ambassadors of the country. Hence, they are accountable to the people of India for their conduct. The Indian team has enough talent and grit at its disposal. Hence, it need not indulge in abusive behaviour to win matches anywhere in the world. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Indian players showed remarkable consistency and played as a unit to win the second Test match against England. India were deserved winners as they batted, bowled and fielded well throughout the match. However, it must also be admitted that the match was closely fought and England lost only after putting up a good fight. 

 The only blot on the Indian side seems to be S. Sreesanth who behaved in an abominable manner. Thankfully, he was quick to express his regrets after the match. Sreesanths aggression has been a cause of concern for many matches now. Someone needs to tell the young fast bowler that his antics jeopardize the spirit of the game. 

 Yours faithfully,

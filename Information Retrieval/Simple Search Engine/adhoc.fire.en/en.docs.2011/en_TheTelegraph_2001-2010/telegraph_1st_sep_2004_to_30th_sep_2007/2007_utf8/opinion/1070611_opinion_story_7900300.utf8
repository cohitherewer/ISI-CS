 NEW CONTROLS

 The urban development ministry has proposed legislation to deal with builders. The bill provides for the setting up of a regulator, with whom every builder would have to register every building project of his. At the time of registration, he would have to give a bank guarantee for a certain proportion of the project cost. Should he fail to deliver the promised premises on time, the regulator would cash the bank guarantee and reimburse the builders clients. The proposed solution is typical of the present government in a number of ways. First, it involves the creation of fresh jobs for bureaucracy. Second, it extends licence-permit raj to an area that has always been free of it. Third, it vests discretion in the regulator on whether to cash the bank guarantee or not, which can be sold to builders for a bribe. Finally, it lays down no penalty on the regulator should he not recompense the builders clients adequately or on time. Is this sort of mechanism, so kind on bureaucracy but of doubtful benefit to builders clients, the only possible solution?

 A building project is an enterprise. It can be said to have failed if it does not deliver properties as promised. In that case, it should be possible for the clients to take the enterprise into bankruptcy; the only legal provision required for this to be possible is that every project should be designed as a company, and everyone who has booked premises in it should acquire shares at the outset. Then if the builder fails to deliver, his clients can liquidate the project and share the money.

 The argument against this simple solution is that some builders will collect cash from clients and vanish. This risk does not apply only to real estate; over 1,000 companies in various sectors incorporated in the early Nineties vanished. The department of company affairs spent many enjoyable man-months investigating their disappearance, but in the end, gave the shareholders nothing. This is presumably why the ministry has thought of a bank guarantee. But this case is appropriate not so much for a bank guarantee as for insurance. A builder should be made to give every client an insurance policy assuring him of compensation should the ordered premises not be delivered on time. What would happen in that eventuality is that the insurance company would take over the clients claims and pay him the insured amount. Then, if the builder reneges on promises, clients can cash their policies and the insurance company can proceed against the builder under the law or under a contract. Insurance is better than government regulation because the insurance market is a competitive one. Some builders will deliver habitually on time, some insurance companies will prove to be better compensators, and both will acquire a reputation that will be of use to clients.

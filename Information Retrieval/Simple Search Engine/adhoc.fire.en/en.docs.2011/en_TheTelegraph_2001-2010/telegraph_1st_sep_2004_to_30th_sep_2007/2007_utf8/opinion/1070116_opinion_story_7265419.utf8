 ROAD RAGE

 There is a price to be paid for progress. And, as events in West Bengal have shown lately, those making the payment are not necessarily the ones reaping its benefit. The violence on Rajarhat Expressway following an accident once more pointed to this aberration, as it did to certain others. The expressway, connecting the city proper to the airport and to several dream projects, is part of the modern infrastructure put in place by a reformist government eager to sell the state as a destination for investors. As an exhibit before a target audience, logic demanded that the road be maintained in the best manner possible. Yet, the connector, built at the cost of Rs 70 crore a little over two years ago, was not only allowed to fall into disrepair, but was also put into use without even the basic road signals and signs in place. The result was expected. In the past one year, the road has claimed 15 lives, mostly of residents of the nearby villages. Complaints, both of villagers and city-dwellers, about the serious threat to human life the present state of the road posed, went unheeded. They found an ear only when the rumour of four children having died in the accident set alight powerful emotions in the surrounding villages. Their residents had mostly borne the brunt of the civic administrations incapacities. But if their previous experience with the states authority had been dismal, the subsequent one has proved even more dastardly. The firing and botched-up operation in Rajarhat by a police inept at handling a mob have not only left a bad taste, but also serious doubts in the popular mind about development itself. The doubts are likely to find echoes elsewhere in the state. 

 Public anger is supposed to have been quelled in Rajarhat by the announcement that the accident victims are alive. It may not take too much effort on the part of the administration to restore law and order and enforce normalcy in the area. Despite the buck-passing among the civic authorities, repair and safety measures may even be undertaken on the expressway. But the government need not rest on such laurels. Development necessarily poses a dilemma for the population and even redefines the interface between the urban and the rural world and between the different strata of society. It is imperative on the part of the government to see that no one section of the population pays too heavy a price for a process that is inevitable.

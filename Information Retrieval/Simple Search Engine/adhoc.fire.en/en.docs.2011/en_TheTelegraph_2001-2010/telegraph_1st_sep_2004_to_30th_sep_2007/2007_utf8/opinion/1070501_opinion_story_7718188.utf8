The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BEST ELEVEN

 A gruesome murder and a ridiculous mess with the rules could not stop the juggernaut of the Australian cricket team. It won the World Cup easily and convincingly. The dominance of the green caps is evident not only from the fact that they won every single match they played but also from the fact that they bowled out their opponents in all matches save the curtailed match against Bangladesh. From the first day, it seemed clear to most observers that Australia would emerge as the champions, and the Aussies proved them right. It can be said without undue exaggeration that Ricky Ponting and his men have taken away something from the proverbial uncertainty of cricket. The team was confident without being complacent; disciplined without being mechanical and robot-like. They brought joy to their playing and a considerable amount of style and flair. There was grace in Pontings stroke-making and a awe-inspiring precision in the manner Adam Gilchrist decimated the Sri Lankan bowling in the finals. But what was most memorable in this team performance was the bowling of Glenn McGrath, who was saying farewell to cricket in this championship. In every match, he bowled with uncanny accuracy and penetration. In the field, the Australians made the least number of mistakes: they held the catches and hit the stumps at the most critical moments.

 What is it that the Aussies have that the other teams lack or do not have enough of? There are two aspects, which are obvious: abundance of fitness and stamina; and an unending hunger for winning. These two, together with the outstanding talents of a few players, take the Australian team well beyond even the above-average side. It is a noticeable fact that the Australians on the field never look tired. Their body language and their mood are always buoyant. In a strenuous tournament spread over more than a month, these aspects often make the difference between the better and the best. What appears to many as the typical Australian swagger is nothing more than the gait and appearance of eleven cricketers who refuse to allow their shoulders to droop.

 There is another factor that made possible the overwhelming triumph of the Australians. This is the depth of their cricket. There is a very deep pool of cricketing talent, which supplies good and outstanding batsmen, bowlers and fielders. The source of that pool is a competitive and well-organized domestic tournament and academies that coach and train youngsters. The emphasis is on fitness and professionalism. This is one reason why a bad Australian fielder has become a contradiction in terms. The Australians take their cricket seriously. On the rare occasions they lose, they draw the right lessons from their defeat. And when they win, they do so handsomely.

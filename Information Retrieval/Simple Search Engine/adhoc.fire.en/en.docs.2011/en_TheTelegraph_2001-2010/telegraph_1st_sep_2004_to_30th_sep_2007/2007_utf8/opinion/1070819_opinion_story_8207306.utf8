 DIARY

 Cash, which traditionally comes in two colours, is the Indian politicians best friend. Which is why it is surprising to find that Arun Jaitley strictly goes for cashless transactions. All his staff at his residence and in court are paid by cheque. Jaitley has gone to the trouble of opening accounts for many of them rather than paying them in cash. So used is the BJP leader and high-profile lawyer to not using cash that the ten thousand-rupee notes his wife had put in his wallet last month remained there till the day he had coffee with some friends in the Central Hall of parliament. And then, the coffee vendor refused to accept Rs 1,000 for a bill of Rs 25, so it wasnt exactly Jaitleys treat in the end. He is also known to have started a welfare fund for his staff, in which he deposits 10 per cent of his earnings (which, again, is received strictly in cheque). If Jaitley had his way, some believe, the BJP would receive donations and contributions for election campaigns only in account-payee cheques. That would make Indian politics such a strange and monochromatic picture, wouldnt it?

 Arun Jaitleys good intentions do not seem to be enough to pull the BJP out of its present doldrums. It seems to be the season for gaffes, faux pas, indiscretions and embarrassing disclosures for the party. Last month, at the height of the Goa crisis, journalists received a message from the BJP office that Churchill Alemao would lead a party delegation to meet the president, Pratibha Patil, and brief her about the situation. None of the leaders including Rajiv Pratap Rudy, the BJP gen-sec in charge of Goa in Delhi seemed to have a clue that Alemao was lunching with Congress netas at that precise moment. Yet another embarrassment for the BJP, and so much fuss to cancel the meeting with the Prez.

 How are the new president and vice-president faring? Pratibha Patil has not done anything in the Rashtrapati Bhavan yet for the grapevine to go buzzing (except peopling the house with family). But her deputy, Hamid Ansari, has started making his presence felt so what if he proved hopelessly inadequate in controlling the unruly Rajya Sabha? He has started with cutting down his office staff from 40 to 20. And unlike his predecessor, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who loved to serve sweets and savouries with tea to his guests, Ansari has decided to make do with just biscuits. Now why is everyone looking so glum?

 Cheer up everybody, the parliament is soon to become a children-friendly zone. Thanks to a brainwave of the speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, the parliament library will start stocking up on books, DVDs, and magazines for children. All this is aimed at encouraging children to read and know more. Just one question: whose children are we talking about here? Surely not the children and grandchildren of our MPs, who already have access to the best libraries in the capital. And certainly not underprivileged children? They do not have a hope in hell of breaching Parliament Houses security for the love of reading books.

 Amitabh Bachchan may have given up on the plot of land he had bought in UP. But will the plot let him go so easily? It seems not. Bachchan has recently written to the Maharashtra deputy chief minister, RR Patil, seeking an investigation into one Vijay Shukla, who has apparently cheated the actor. The entire account of how Shukla posed as a fan and then produced a fake certificate of Bachchans land-ownership is all very credible. But Patil and his men are a little baffled as to why the megastar has filed his complaint in Mumbai when the fraudster and the plot of land in question are both in UP.

 As if his existing responsibilities were not enough, Pranab Mukherjee has been saddled with yet another job: to give tuitions to Congressmen on the nuclear deal with the US. This is not private tuition, because it is the public who will be the ultimate beneficiaries of Pranabdas knowledge. 

 After a day of much verbal duel in the Lok Sabha, Sonia Gandhi, breezing past LK Advani to her chamber: Your throat must be sore from all that slogan-shouting.

 Advani: We had nothing to do 

 with that...we sat through quietly.

 Footnote

 The good news first. A tantrik university is about to open shop. Guess where? In Kerala. Surprised? Dont think for a moment that there is a conflict of interests with Marxist ideology. It is only because there were regular reports of irregular business at the Sabarimala temple that the LDF minister, S Sudhakaran, decided that priests were the real problem and a tantrik university to train priests is the need of the hour. 

 In Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, priests are having a field day, conducting havans, mainly against one minister or another. Many a times, the same priest performs rituals for rival leaders. One Baba is known to shower his blessings on leaders from three inimical parties, thus maintaining a very delicate balance of power. If all the praying over ghee, fire, and sometimes even blood and bones of animals had their desired effect, then most of our political class would have been wiped out by now. And then who would hire the priests?

 GETTING THERE SLOWLY

 GWYNNE DYER

 FIFTH COLUMN

 The most extreme diagnosis of Italys problem was offered by journalist Peter Popham in The Independent. He blamed it all on the Vatican: Imagine that Hitler did not die in his bunker in 1945 but instead cut a deal with the new West German government, giving him continued sovereignty over a small patch of Berlin and continued intellectual hegemony over the millions he had brainwashed during the previous decade... Italys Vatican problem is a lot like that, with the difference that the Church has been wielding its mind-control for nearly two millennia.

 The trigger for this extraordinary outburst was the week-long political crisis that nearly brought down Prime Minister Romano Prodis centre-left government, Italys 61st since World War II. Yet, Popham is not anti-Catholic. It is just that, like most people who spend a lot of time in Italy, he has both fallen in love with the country and lost patience with it. He blamed the Vatican this time because the crisis was provoked by a government plan to legalize civil unions even for gays, which greatly annoyed the Catholic Church. But it is more complicated than that.

 The vote that Prodis government lost was actually on a proposal to leave 1,900 Italian troops in Afghanistan until 2011 and to double the size of an American military base outside Vicenza. Both projects are very unpopular in Italy, but they were part of the deal that created the nine-party coalition behind Prodis government, and only two senators from the far-left defected in the key vote on February 21.

 Among the mafia

 The government would still have won the vote if senator-for-life, Giulio Andreotti, had not unexpectedly voted against it. Andreotti is a strong supporter of Nato and the American alliance. So why would he vote against that bill? Because it was going to be so close that his surprise no vote could bring Prodis government down.

 Why would he want to do that? Andreotti has always been close to both the Catholic Church and the mafia, but on this occasion, it was the former tie that mattered. The Vatican wanted to kill the civil union proposal, which required killing Prodis government. Andreotti seized the opportunity that presented itself. It worked, too: a week later, Prodi managed to revive his coalition government, but this time, their agreed programme does not include the civil union project. 

 Most Italians would agree that there is something wrong with their country, but it is not the Church that bothers them. The stagnant economy makes matters worse even Spain will overtake Italy in per capita income in a couple of years. For almost 40 years after 1945, while the rest of Europe was growing and changing very fast, Italy grew but did not change, because politics and all of society were frozen in a deeply conservative and profoundly corrupt pattern. To keep the huge Communist party from winning power and taking Italy out of Nato, the Christian Democratic Party had to be kept in power permanently 

 That system ended 15 years ago when the Christian Democrats imploded in a blizzard of corruption scandals and Communism simultaneously went out of fashion, but Italians have a lot of lost time to make up. Moreover, the decision to swap the lira for the euro was a disaster for Italy because the country lost the ability to remain competitive by continually devaluing its currency. Italian politics is still poisonous, the justice system is a joke, and the efforts at reform are sabotaged by the beneficiaries of the current state of affairs.

 But that is about what you would expect at this stage of the process of modernization, because it is a process, and it takes time. Spain is about 30 years into a similar process, dating from the death of Franco and the end of fascism, and it is thriving at every level. Italy is 15 years in, and feeling the strain. But it will probably get there in the end.

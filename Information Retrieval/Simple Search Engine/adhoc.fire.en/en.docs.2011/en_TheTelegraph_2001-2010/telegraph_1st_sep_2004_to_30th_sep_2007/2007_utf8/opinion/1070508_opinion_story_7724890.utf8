 Letters to Editor

 Four walls a prison make

 Sir The report, Lady locked up for years (April 28), is remarkable for the way in which it brings out two contrary facets of human behaviour. While the attitude of Madhabi Dass closest kin towards her is unbelievable in its inhumanity, the sympathy displayed by Madhabis neighbours in rescuing her from captivity is heartening at the same time. Had it not been for neighbours like Kaveri Chakraborty, who spotted Madhabi in her solitary confinement, or those others who then forced themselves into her home, Madhabi might have had to spend many more years locked up indoors. By keeping a watchful eye on the happenings of the Das household, freeing Madhabi and informing the police, the residents of Umacharan Ray Road in Baruipur have demonstrated true neighbourly feelings. 

 For the misdeeds of Madhabis husband, mother-in-law and 17-year-old daughter, who had conspired to torture and incarcerate her, no word of condemnation can be enough. Harassment of women by their husbands and in-laws is not unheard of in our society, but how could Madhabis daughter participate in the persecution of her mother? The husband, mother-in-law and daughter deserve the strongest possible punishment for what they have done. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir The forced confinement of Madhabi Das makes one feel ashamed of being part of a society that has a battery of gender-sensitive laws, but only on paper. Of what use was the domestic violence bill to Madhabi, who was systematically tortured by her husband for fifteen years because she had failed to bring him enough dowry. Madhabis case proves yet again that legislations cannot help women unless certain practical considerations are taken into account. Madhabi could not have contacted the police or lodged a complaint since she was locked up in the room. It was only because her neighbours happened to catch a glimpse of her face that they felt suspicious and the police were informed. 

 Even if for arguments sake one assumes that Madhabis husband, Madhu Das, was discontented with his wife after marriage, then why did he not get separated from her legally? He took the law into his own hands and chose to punish his wife by imprisoning her. Madhu Das had been arrested seven years ago when his neighbours had complained to the police that he was beating his wife. However, he managed to get out on bail. This easy escape from the law must have encouraged him to torture his wife even more. Thankfully, Madhabi had kind and vigilant neighbours who came to her rescue yet again. But what about those women who have to suffer in silence because they cannot count on either the police or their neighbours for help? 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir Even a prisoner under life sentence enjoys certain basic amenities, such as a toilet in the corner of the cell. But Madhabi Dass torturers including her husband and daughter did not allow her even that. She took her meals which were few and far between from and relieved herself on the same floor of the dinghy room where she was confined for five years. Before and/or during this, she was also physically abused, as is evident from the burn marks on her person. 

 One hopes that Madhabi will get justice after surviving fifteen years of such inhuman treatment. But even if she does, is she in any shape to enjoy a better life? The State should take responsibility for treating her trauma and rehabilitating her in society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir How can human beings stoop so low as to torment and imprison a fellow being who also happens to be their wife, daughter-in-law and mother? Madhabi Dass story reveals the unspeakable wickedness that men are capable of. Madhabis daughter, Ananya, is almost an adult, but she did not stop her father and grandmother from hurting and imprisoning Madhabi. In fact, she colluded with them to prolong the torture.

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir It is ironic that just a day after India became a $1-trillion economy (Billion with a trillion on paper, April 27), came the front-page news of Madhabi Das being imprisoned in a room for five years. This shows that all claims of India having progressed are plain hogwash. Reaching a particular figure in the GDP growth chart cannot make India a modern nation, on a par with its Western counterparts, when the outlook of the majority of its population remains frozen in the Middle Ages. 

 Yours faithfully,

Yagnaseni Roy, Siliguri

 Sir Cases like that of Madhabi Das abound in India, though only a few get exposed. Even Madhabi had to endure fifteen years of partial and total confinement before she was discovered and rescued. And for one Madhabi rescued, there are still hundreds launguishing within abusive domestic spaces.

 Yours faithfully,

Ritesh Banerjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The Calcutta high court has rightly ordered the survey of eight hotels in Mandarmani to assess whether they are too close to the sea and thus violating the norms set by the Coastal Zone Regulation Act (Beach hotel scan, April 28). The hotels, constructed so close to the sea, not only flout environmental norms but also endanger the life of tourists who book themselves there. An unusually high tide might wash away the hotels, along with the lodgers. A similar survey should also be ordered into the hotels crowding the beachfront in Digha. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

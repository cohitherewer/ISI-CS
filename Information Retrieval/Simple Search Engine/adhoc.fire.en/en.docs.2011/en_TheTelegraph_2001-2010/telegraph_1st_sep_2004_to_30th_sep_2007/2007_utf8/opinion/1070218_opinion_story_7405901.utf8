The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 COACH TO THE WORLD CUP

 There are cricketers who play, and there are cricketers who think about the game. The latter become good coaches, if they choose to become one, after they have retired. From the detailed interview that Greg Chappell, the coach of the Indian cricket team, gave to The Telegraph, it is evident if such evidence was at all needed how much thought Chappell actually gives to every aspect of the game. There are two comments of his which need to be highlighted since they are likely to be missed by most common followers of the game who think cricket consists of good batting, and that too of hitting boundaries and sixes. The most important of these is the emphasis Chappell has placed on fielding and on Indias weakness in this sphere. Fielding, as most genuine followers of cricket acknowledge, is the most vital aspect of the game. One reason for this is that at an average, a player spends more time fielding than he does either batting or bowling. The other reason is that a catch taken or dropped or a run out missed or made can completely change the complexion of the match. There is also the point of saving runs. Chappell has admitted that the Indian teams fielding abilities are well below par: there are too many players he and the captain will have to hide on the field. The captain, Rahul Dravid, put it somewhat euphemistically when he said, Weve got to be smart with the placement of certain fielders. In low-scoring matches, the saving of runs might be the key to winning them.

 The other important point that Chappell makes concerns the selection of bowlers. He urges lovers of cricket to look not only at the number of wickets a bowler takes, but also at the opportunities that he creates. This point cannot be overemphasized. It was said of the famous Brian Statham-Fred Trueman combination that many batsmen escaped from Stathams pinpoint accuracy to Truemans end and then gave the latter their wickets because they allowed their concentration to lapse that little bit. No scoreboard, which, as Neville Cardus famously said, is an ass, can ever record this contribution of Statham and other bowlers like him. It is significant that in an era when numbers and statistics seem to determine everything, Chappell takes cognizance of such an ineffable and non-quantifiable ability.

 Chappell has been given a team that is rich in experience but short on youth and fitness. Chappells thrust has been on introducing new talent into the team because that is the path to the future. Without opportunities, no talent can bloom. In his interview, he has tried to put a positive gloss on experience, despite calling the team that he has been given Dads Army. Making a virtue out of a necessity has always been the hallmark of a good strategist, and Chappell wants to make the best use of the team over whose selection he had no choice.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 All for a safe journey

 Sir It is well-known that ministers, MPs and MLAs continue to live in government bungalows even after their tenures run out; high-profile convicts enjoy five-star luxuries in prison; relatives of ministers proudly travel without ticket on trains. So why is there so much fuss if Sanjay Dutt goes to Katra in a government car, with the full knowledge of the state government? What if Dutt happened to be attacked by militants while travelling by private transport? Wouldnt all the blame then be heaped on the government for not providing adequate security to him?

 Yours faithfully,

 Geraldine H., Mumbai

 From ramp to tramp

 Sir Gitanjali Nagpals fate should be an eye-opener for the thousands of young and impressionable women who aspire to become either famous models or actresses and run away from home, finally either landing up in prostitution- and drug-related rackets, or being left emotionally shattered by the fast-paced and competitive life in the glamour business (Model at mercy of mean streets, Sept 4). Not very long ago, Angelin Laha, an upcoming model in Calcutta had committed suicide after her mentors in the modelling circuit tried to pressurize her into granting sexual favours as a short-cut to success. Despite her affluent background and English education, Nagpals case shows up the dark side of the show business. Those who are unable to cope with the unhealthy competition often land up on the sidewalk. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir Gitanjali Nagpal, a one-time model now reduced to destitution, deserves sympathy. She should be saved the ignominy of having her photographs splashed on the front-pages of newspapers, arousing unwanted curiosity among the public. The NGOs taking care of her must ensure that she returns to normal life and is saved from becoming a public exhibit.

 Yours faithfully, 

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir Did Gitanjali Nagpal deserve to be on the front page of The Telegraph? For anyone travelling regularly in Indian cities, beggars and mentally-deranged men and women are a common sight. And many of them are as young and pretty as Nagpal, though they may not have been former models.

 Drug abuse and relationship traumas have almost become occupational hazards of show business. Remember Nafisa Joseph? When you are on the fast lane, the chances of slipping on it are also high, and Nagpal must have stepped on it with this knowledge. She cannot blame her profession now for her plight. From the photograph, she looks far less dishevelled and dirty than the average street-dweller. Could this be an attempt to be back in the limelight?

 Yours faithfully, 

Tapan Pal, Batanagar 

 Sir In the glamour industry, the rate of failure is much greater than that of success. One only has to think of the large number of actors and models who remain strugglers all their lives. Then there are those like Kumar Gaurav and Rahul Roy who get immediate success in their career but do a string of bad films and shows and end up nowhere. Gitanjali Nagpal probably falls in the second category. It is easy for those who have tasted success to turn to alcohol and drugs on finding the going tough.

 The film and fashion industries catch people really young. At such a tender age, most have not developed the skills to deal with failure. Their employers need to recruit counsellors to help those who feel troubled. But a counsellor cannot live their lives for them, and they must find their own way of dealing with lifes many trials and tribulations. As in Nagpals case, those who feel helpless and need a guiding touch must be offered the same. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

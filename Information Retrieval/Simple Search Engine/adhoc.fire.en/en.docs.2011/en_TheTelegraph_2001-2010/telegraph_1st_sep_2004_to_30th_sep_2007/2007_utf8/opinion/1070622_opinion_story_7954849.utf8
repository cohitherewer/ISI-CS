 UNDIVIDED STATE

 Thus far, and no further. The largest minority community of India, which has allowed itself to be shamelessly wooed by politicians during election time with incredible promises, universities and Friday holidays, seems to have suddenly realized that it is looking down a crevice. The plea for reservations for Dalit Muslims, endorsed by the Sachar committee, and more recently by the Ranganath Mishra committee on religious and linguistic minorities, would have allowed a substantial section of the community to partake of the privileges that have made kings of paupers. But leaders of the community are unwilling to be swayed off their feet by such revolutionary prospects. Six seminaries in Andhra Pradesh have come together to issue a fatwa against the classification of the community along caste lines. The order puts paid to the Congresss efforts in the state to specially favour certain segments of the community for their loyalty while allowing itself another opportunity to show off its secular credentials. 

 The argument put forward by the clerics is simple enough. Islam does not allow for caste divides, and to delineate sub-castes among Muslims would be to go against the prescriptions of the shariat. For a community that has worked as a body in deciding where to cast its vote, divisions and thereby divided loyalties are undoubtedly a dangerous development. The clerics could not have spoken more sanely in discouraging fractious politics in the name of positively discriminating in favour of the underdogs. The Gujjar-Meena conflict in Rajasthan, and, even before that, the desperation of Uttar Pradeshs electoral candidates to lay claim to caste loyalties should have made obvious the pernicious results of Indias preoccupation with reservation politics. But perhaps it is more important to draw attention to the solution the clerics have offered to the problem of reaching help to disadvantaged Muslims. Their suggestion that reservations be provided to socially, economically and educationally backward Muslims begs for a more realistic appraisal of the categorizations being made for the bestowing of quotas by the State. This is also what the Supreme Court has been arguing for. The re-evaluation of needs should be done less on religious and caste lines and more on socio-economic backwardness.

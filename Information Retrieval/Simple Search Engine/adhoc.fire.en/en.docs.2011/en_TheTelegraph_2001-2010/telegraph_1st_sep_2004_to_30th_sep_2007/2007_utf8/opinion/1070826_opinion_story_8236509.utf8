 A DIFFERENT 

 FILM 

 - Two geniuses and an Indian virtuoso of the imperfect image 

 The Thin Edge 

 Ruchir Joshi

 Michelangelo Antonioni 

 When Ingmar Bergman died last 

 Month, a friend sent me an sms: Bergman dead. Strange. 

 Thought he had died a long time ago. I was travelling 

 and so not in a position to do my usual trawl through the 

 obituaries, but even as I was thinking about Bergman, I 

 saw the small item in the newspapers the next day which 

 told me Michelangelo Antonioni had passed away. At 89 and 

 94 respectively, neither passing was tragic or unexpected. 

 Both had lived full and rich lives and both had completed 

 their substantial bodies of work; Antonioni was, amazingly, 

 still working till very recently while Bergman was in firm 

 and graceful retirement. Neither may have physically left 

 the film theatre of the world but the fact was that both 

 had had the good fortune to see their major contributions 

 absorbed, and in many ways digested, by the image-alimentary 

 channels of succeeding generations. 

 In that sense, they were comparable 

 to those two other greats, the late Akira Kurosawa and, 

 of course, Jean-Luc Godard, who is still very much with 

 us. Neither Bergman nor Antonioni was cut off tragically, 

 with potential work still simmering inside, like Ritwik 

 Ghatak, Rainer Werner Fassbinder or Andrei Tarkovsky; despite 

 health problems, neither had to face the brutal ambush of 

 age and the quick ebbing away of his great powers as did 

 Satyajit Ray. If there was A Late Style in the sense that 

 Edward Said defines it, then it came early for Antonioni, 

 and Bergman could be argued to have developed his almost 

 in mid-career; both had done their great early work by the 

 early Sixties, and each then proceeded to push his envelope, 

 secure in the knowledge that the place of his oeuvre in 

 the history of cinema was secure. Antonioni had the major 

 works of Red Desert, Blow-up, Zabriskie 

 Point and his crowning achievement in The Passenger, 

 before a steep drop into slightly sad soft-porn ramblings; 

 Bergman, too, re- invented himself from Persona and 

 Scenes from a Marriage onwards, moving on towards 

 the finish with the elegant but comparatively slight Fanny 

 and Alexander, The Rehearsal and so on. 

 What was gripping about each cineaste, 

 gripping in very different ways and yet shared, was the 

 way in which they moved away from the cage of dramatic narrative 

 and plunged deeper and deeper into the pure pleasure and 

 the unadulterated pain of the moving image. The words were 

 always there, of course, and in Bergmans case, always retaining 

 a kind of pride of place, but they no longer ruled in tandem 

 with plot and drama. For a while, roughly between 1962 and 

 1975, these two (arguably along with Bresson), were the 

 ones you went to see when you wanted the pure and complex 

 flicker of image and sound without controlling static from 

 the story-bunker. It was quite edgy stuff then, difficult 

 and definitely an acquired taste, something akin to dhrupad 

 or the music of Stockhausen or Ornette Coleman and it is 

 quite hard to take even now, unless youre really in the 

 mood. But what many young critics dont understand especially 

 Western ones who think cinema began with Quentin Tarantino 

 is that among these two, Bresson, and the choppy and stroppy 

 Godard, they irretrievably altered the DNA of the moving 

 image. They changed the lensing through which we perceive 

 light and architecture, both immobile and that of humans; 

 they shifted our sense of colour, actually even before they 

 began to work with colour film; ultimately they provided 

 the successful experiments which now allow us to break up 

 visual time, much in the same way Picasso and Braque sliced 

 up pictorial space in painting. 

 Naturally, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, 

 aka Dramatic Narrative and Story-Line, werent about to 

 take this lying down. They hit back with the massive, spiteful 

 force of any State or Corporate mega-power thats been stung 

 in a bad place. As these directors weakened or faltered 

 or the situation tugged at the carpet under them, the old 

 criminals re-established themselves under the guise of anti-elitism, 

 of accessibility, of serious entertainment that carries 

 a message, and so on. The result was that, politically, 

 at least, the big art-politik powers seemed to have won 

 hands down: neither Bergmans sparely despairing humanism 

 nor Antonionis elegant anarchism made any major dent. Aesthetically 

 and stylistically though, it was a different matter the 

 missiles did go in and have been imploding quietly over 

 the last two decades. 

 The difference between Picasso 

 and Braque and these guys was that the earlier two brought 

 Modernism into fourth gear, while the two who recently departed 

 were a part of the small gravedigger-crew that buried Modernism 

 even while giving us some of its late supernovas, for 

 example in The Seventh Seal and L Avventura; 

 perceptologically, they helped bring us to where we are 

 today, helping us to deal with whatever shattered post-mo 

 planet we now inhabit.

 Today you can see (and you dont 

 even have to look that carefully) the ghosts, the traces 

 and re-seedings of Antonioni and Bergman everywhere, from 

 the crassest advertising to the most sophisticated commercial 

 cinema: the vast, empty architectural space might be the 

 pregnant site of a gun-battle about to ensue; in the tight 

 close-up of the woman flitting in and out of focus, Liv 

 Ullmans face might have been replaced by some new Hollywood 

 talent doing unmentionable sexual things; the oddly amplified 

 greens and reds of a landscape might just be the setting 

 for a perfume ad; but the traces are there, as is the huge 

 debt owed to the two masters whove, bizarrely, made their 

 exit in tandem.

 As if two geniuses going was not 

 bad enough, I got news the other day of the death of K.K. 

 Mahajan, the brilliant cinematographer who worked with Mani 

 Kaul, Kumar Shahani and so many times with Mrinal Sen. Strange 

 again, the timing, for here was the one Indian cinematographer 

 who understood and absorbed the cine-language of Bergman 

 and especially of Antonioni very early indeed. From the 

 late Sixties, Mahajan was the sometimes difficult and irascible 

 man to whom directors turned when they wanted to move the 

 Image from its Third Class Sleeper to sit in the First Class 

 compartment next to the over-fattened passenger, Mr Story. 

 If Subrata Mitra and his generation 

 of light-masters were the bravura artists of the perfectly 

 formed frame, then Mahajan was perhaps the first one who 

 was the virtuoso of the imperfect image. He was the man 

 who partnered the new generation of Indian Art Film directors 

 as they attempted to construct the images of the India of 

 the Seventies. The country and society that were emerging 

 needed a very different look from the one produced by the 

 mirrors that had been (mostly) turned to the past during 

 the Fifties and the Sixties and K.K. was among the pioneers 

 who embraced the European cinema and film-philosophy thrown 

 up by the violent churn of the Sixties. 

 Unlike Antonioni and Bergman and 

 their cameramen, there was to be not much international 

 fame for Mahajan, no cult status a la Sven Nykvist, 

 Bergmans great collaborator on camera, no jet-setting challenges 

 like the ones received by Vittorio Storaro, who was first 

 Bertoluccis and then Coppolas cinematographer. Increasingly, 

 as his directors (save Mrinal Sen) became more and more 

 frustrated under the tepid but ceaseless onslaught of Indian 

 middle cinema, Mahajans own work and life also took damage. 

 As a new generation of cameramen and women began to occupy 

 the avant-garde ground (such as it was), twinned 

 with their director pals from film-school, assignments reportedly 

 became rarer and rarer for K.K. Though very different in 

 both style and nature from Subrata Mitra, the isolation 

 of his last years was not dissimilar: the double exile of 

 the man who is always behind the scenes, always behind the 

 director, and, increasingly, forced, if not to be behind, 

 then at the side of the times despite having once been a 

 major ground-breaker. 

 But, as we are still in the process 

 of seeing, these things sometimes turn in cycles, and who 

 knows? Perhaps in some pellicular Valhalla, these three 

 men, two quite old and one not quite so old, are nodding 

 to each other in calm recognition and waiting for a different 

 film to begin.

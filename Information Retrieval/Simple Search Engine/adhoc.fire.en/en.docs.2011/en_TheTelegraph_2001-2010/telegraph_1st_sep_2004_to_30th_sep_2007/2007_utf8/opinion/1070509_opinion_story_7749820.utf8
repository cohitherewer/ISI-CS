 WOMEN BEWARE WOMEN

 Somak Ghoshal

 Haseena Nasreen is fearless in her love for M.S. Dhoni. On Sunday, she invaded the security around her Prince Charming and hugged him for a brief while, and, in those few seconds, made national news. Nasreen, also known as Shiuli, became obsessed with Dhoni after watching his spectacular innings against Sri Lanka in October 2005. Her faith in her hero remains unshaken, despite Dhonis dismal performance in the recently concluded World Cup. Shiuli is enamoured of his hard-hitting batting style and his hair. She has streaked her hair like Dhoni. 

 On the face of it, Shiulis actions, which even included throwing her autograph book to Sourav Ganguly from the gallery, are hardly sensational. Streakers, stalkers and other half-crazed fans have frequently embellished the pantheon of cricket-enthusiasts. In the subcontinent, a win or a loss in a cricket match is routinely turned into an occasion for brawls, wife-beating, heart attacks, suicides, and even homicide. So why did Shiuli become the darling of an indulgent media, who seemed to find her ardour rather cute? Was it her bravado, inspired by a love of cricket (and of Dhoni), that appeared amusing? Or, maybe, it was the spectacle of a damsel in desperation that produced a gendered gaze on a female cricket fan. The reactions, from the media and the public, would have certainly been different had the fan been male. 

 The eye on Shiuli is not even exclusively male. It is that of a society which is still unfamiliar with, and awkward about, the relationship between sports and women, particularly if the game happens to be as masculine as cricket. Last month, Mukul Kesavan reported in his Cricinfo column an exchange between two cricket-experts, the Nawab of Pataudi and the sports journalist, Kadambari Murali. Pataudi had allegedly asked Murali if, as a woman, she perceived cricket as a manly game. She had to explain to him that she doesnt approach the game as a woman, but rather reports and comments on it as a professional journalist. 

 Gender benders

 Such a patronizing attitude towards serious female commentators on cricket fails to surprise in India, where cricket is not only perceived as an exclusively male game, but also where all the gender stereotypes are reinforced by women like Mandira Bedi, who are used as brand ambassadors of the game. Bedi was introduced as the X-factor into the Indian cricket scene to enhance the TRP, which would have been a singularly difficult task for her male fellow-anchor, Charu Sharma, alone. That her contribution to the game was humiliatingly nominal seemed not to matter to either Bedi or her audiences. 

 Ever since her arrival on the scene, Bedi has been in the news for all the wrong reasons, (her noodle-straps, and now, that treacherous, Satya-Paul sari). Do women like Bedi represent the nave enthusiasts, who add patriotic value to the game in spite of their nearly total ignorance of cricket? Could such a token inclusion ordinary women being finally made part of a manly game be flattering to women? Men may not be bothered by the limitless idiocy projected by a pretty mascot like Bedi, but surely for many sensitive, cricket-loving women, Bedi is nothing short of a liability someone who overshadows, by her market-value, such cricket-writers of sterling intelligence as Kadambari Murali, Sharda Ugra and Mini Kapoor. 

 Shiulis pampering by the media, too, is a symptom of this crassly gendered perception of sports. It is probable that Shiulis passion for Dhoni far exceeds her interest in the game; at least thats what the stories reported in the media about her seem to suggest. She would probably not have been in the news at all had she just cultivated her passion for the game, rather than for the heroes and the cult of hero-worship associated with it.

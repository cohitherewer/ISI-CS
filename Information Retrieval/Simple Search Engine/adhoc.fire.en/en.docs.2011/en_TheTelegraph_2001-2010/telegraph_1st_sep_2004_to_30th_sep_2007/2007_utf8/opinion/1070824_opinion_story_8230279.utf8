 Searching for usable heroes

A flag, a song and a pinch of salt: Freedom fighters of India (Puffin, Rs 195) by Subhadra Sen Gupta recalls the personalities of Indias freedom fighters, and recounts the exceptional courage and determination they had showed. In her foreword, Sen Gupta hints at the difference between their actions and those of todays agitators, who harass people in the name of protest. From M.K. Gandhi to Subhas Bose, Aurobindo Ghose to Sarojini Naidu, prominent Indians connected with the anti-colonial struggle have separate chapters dedicated to each of them. Meant primarily for young readers, the books diction and syntax are simple and the narratives straightforward and entertaining.

 Up your service! (EastWest, Rs 295) by Ron Kaufman is advertised as a must own book for CEOs and managers eager to improve the quality of service within their organizations. Kaufman has capitalized on the significance of service following the current emphasis on value-added experience. The book offers pragmatic advice with a philosophical and ethical underpinning. Kaufmans counsel ranges from that on legal and business affairs to tips on dress and dining habits.

Kirkbys Changeling (Penguin, Rs 295) by Madeleine Brent is another Peter O Donnell romance classic in the Retro Revival series. Chantal, a young circus artiste touring Hungary, tries to solve the mystery of her life with the help of an amnesiac tramp named Martin. She is running away from an unhappy childhood in England. But, narrative compulsions return her to England and then back again to Eastern Europe for her story to be fully told. The books real value is as a collectors item, given the history of ODonnells pseudonym. 

 Mosquito (Harper Perennial, Rs 295) by Roma Tearne is set in a Sri Lanka that lures with the promise of solace but has mostly blood and violence to offer. The protagonist, Theo, returns to the country after his wifes death and tries to forget his loss in the beauty of the land. But his attempt to reclaim his life is cut short by the civil war. Although the novels virtue is mostly confined to some of its lyrical passages, it is nevertheless a poignant portrayal of a civil war that needlessly wastes human life.

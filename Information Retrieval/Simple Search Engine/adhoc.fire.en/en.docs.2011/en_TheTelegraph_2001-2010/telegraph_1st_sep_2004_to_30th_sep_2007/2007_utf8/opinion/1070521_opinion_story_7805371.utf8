 BETWEEN HOMES

 No custody battle can be painless. But the often bitter struggle over a child between two separated parents is fundamentally different from a situation where the grandparents on both sides have to fight over the child. In such cases, it would seem that the substance of the term, custody, has changed, and the pain in the struggle is darker and far more intense. This is what is happening to the three-year-old Tanisha Mukherjee, who cannot possibly grasp that her mother has committed suicide, allegedly driven to it by her father, who is now in jail. Her mothers parents want to bring her out of the household which, they feel, took their daughters life. Tanishas paternal grandfather, however, says that the little girl has lived with them all her life, and would be uncomfortable elsewhere.

 What is best for the child? The arguments of both sets of grandparents are reasonable. In any case, a court cannot deal with competing emotional needs. Also, the crime has not yet been proven. What does the child need to know, if not now, but when she is older? Which set of grandparents would tell her, and would it change her life? Is it reason, or love, or habit, that must be considered? And, as the courts refusal to intervene at this stage indicates, can a court really decide this? Yet, without a court to decide these matters, there is nowhere else to go. A divorce is a disruption of the married condition, regarded as normal by society. Two people going their own ways is not a crime, hence the laws of custody are fairly clear on these occasions. But when the root of civilized life is torn out, and spouse kills or tortures spouse, what is to happen to the children? Perhaps the law should look at such cases as a separate category. As important would be programmes that could be used in schools, and by special counsellors, to lessen the damage to the children.

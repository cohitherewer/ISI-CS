 PASTORAL PLEASURES

 This Above All - Khushwant Singh

 Picture of happiness

 It is great shikaar country. Wild boar and deer come down from the Shivaliks to the valley to feed on ripening crops. Farmers welcome shikaaris to get rid of them, said my escort as we drove along the countryside. On one side, was the valley thickly covered with mesquite (kabuli keekar) it was a sea of the undulating green of Haryana stretching up to the hills of Himachal Pradesh. On the other, vast stretches of farmland cut neatly into squares, some stubbled with recently harvested wheat and the golden-yellow of sunflowers in full bloom. From one spot, I could hear black partridges calling from the hillsides, lehsen, piyaz, adrak, Khuda teri qudrat, and brown partridges reply, teetu, teetu, teetu. My escort continued: There are quite a few leopards as well. They come prowling at night to pick up village dogs they relish dog meat. And snakes, including pythons. One rainy reason, I ran over a huge black cobra crossing the road, he must have been almost eight feet long. There is a special name for that variety of king cobras.

 I told him, Hamadryad, Ive never seen one.

 Thats right, hamadryad. You can see plenty of them around here. I am told that besides frogs and lizards they eat small varieties of snakes as well.

 I turned my gaze towards the pastoral country of the plains. We passed villages: all built of bricks (lot of brick kilns along the route). A few large mansions of gleaming white. Not one hut. The atmosphere was one of prosperity and harmony. By the road side, I noticed many graves draped in blue cloth signifying significant Muslim presence. It was also dotted with Hindu temples and gurdwaras made of snow-white marble.

 Where does this haven of harmony and well-being exist? Come down the Shimla-Delhi road, go through Kalka, the Mughal gardens at Pinjore, past the road, which leads to Chandigarh, and a few miles further, turn left before you get to NH1. It is a detour to avoid going through Ambala City. It runs along the hills for quite some miles before it meets the main highway to Karnal. Many roads take off from this road to other towns and villages. Like elsewhere in Haryana, there are no signboards to guide travellers. You often lose your way and have to ask people for directions. We met the same fate but with pleasant consequences. We piled on alongside a young couple on a motorcycle facing the opposite direction. They too seemed lost. There was a powerfully built swarthy man. From the bracelet around his wrist, I could make out he was mona Sikh. The girl was a gori chittee, fair-skinned and a full-blossomed lass. From the red bangles on her arms I could make out they were newly-married. As propriety demanded, we asked the man whether we were on the right road to Karnal. Before he could answer, the girl beamed a smile, waving her bangled arms and replied: Assee vee guachey hoi haan we too have lost our way, koi dassan walaa naheen is there no one to guide us where we are? She looked the picture of happiness and fulfilment much like the landscape around us.

 Litigation in his blood

 No one will deny that Baljit Malik has done more to protect the environment of Kasauli from the depredations of property developers than anyone else. He has been the moving spirit of the Kasauli Bachao Andolan. His efforts have the sanction of a supportive chief minister of Himachal Pradesh. He argues his cases himself. However, in his crusade he has crossed swords with a succession of brigade commanders of the Cantonment, citizens, whom he accused of breaking Cantonment regulations, and just about everyone who had once been his friend. He has been expelled from the Kasauli Club, as he had earlier been expelled from Delhis elite clubs for breaching rules of club etiquette. Litigation is in his blood. He is litigating against his brother, cousins and his wife (mother of his two children) and is on bail on charges of assault and battery. Nevertheless he battles on. Recently, when his pet dog died, he celebrated its ascension to heaven by throwing a cocktail-cum-dinner and dance party. He had a jazz band brought up from Delhi. The party went on till the early hours. He publishes a tabloid, Kasauli News, in English and Hindi. He is its editor, printer, publisher, distributor and, I suspect, its sole-subscriber and reader. He has a dig at everyone; I have come in for my share of them.

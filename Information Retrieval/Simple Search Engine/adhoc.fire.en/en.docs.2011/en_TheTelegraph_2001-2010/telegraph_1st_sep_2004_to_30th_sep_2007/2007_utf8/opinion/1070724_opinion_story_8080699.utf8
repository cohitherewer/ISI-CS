 SULKING KNIGHTS, SELFISH DAMSELS

 In the story of a man defending a womans honour, the blame comes to rest on the woman if she does not speak up for him, writes Anchita Ghatak

 Listen to me 

 The morning papers greeted me with an eloquent headline and a news report asking a certain lady to speak up. Accompanying it was the photograph of a sad young man. It was a first-person account of Jagannath De, who had been travelling by bus with a classmate, Subhendu Roy, and had been set upon by half-a-dozen men, also passengers on the same bus. The bullies roughed up Jagannath and left him with serious injuries.

 So where does the lady come in? A young woman was travelling on the same bus. She stood near the ladies seats. Two men sidled close to the young woman and began nudging, pushing and jostling her an everyday activity on Calcuttas buses, normalized by the term eve teasing. 

 As I read about this womans ordeal, I went back more than two decades. Many instances of harassment on buses and roads went flashing past. I will talk about just one. I had boarded a bus for a short ride. As I climbed on, I felt fingers going up my legs. I kicked out and screamed. Very soon some men wanted to know why I was kicking out. I said that people were touching me and I needed to shake them off. Needless to say, I was greeted with the popular Calcutta advice of travelling in taxis or cars if I could not take a little discomfort. All the while, fingers were still running up and down my legs. I got off the bus and walked the rest of the way home. 

 This young womans story differs from mine in that I had no fellow citizen to support me. Jagannath saw these men harassing her and asked the goons to stop. One thing led to another and Jagannath was assaulted by half-a-dozen men. As the violence escalated, two elderly gentlemen apparently asked the conductor to ensure that the fighting men were sent off the bus. 

 In Jagannaths first-person account, narrated to a reporter, there are certain things that have not been talked about. There is a graphic description of the way Jagannath was assaulted, but we dont know what happened afterwards. Did Jagannath go to the police? Were the police supportive? Have any witnesses appeared? 

 Echoing the aftermath of Bapi Sens murder, there is now a fervent appeal to the woman in the bus to come forward. After Bapi Sens death, too, the discussion had shifted from the rogue cops who killed their colleague to the perceived selfishness of the woman, who did not come forward to tell her story and publicly mourn this hero who died to save her. In my view, Bapi Sen did not die because he tried to save a particular woman from harassment. He was killed because he refused to turn a blind eye to the wrongdoings of his colleagues. 

 It is fascinating to see that when men voice concern over violence against women, they are lionized by society, with the media playing a significant role in this glorification. The spotlight shifts from the violence against women to the knight in shining armour. The story of this defender of womens honour is not complete without the adoration of the damsel in distress and so, the pressure on women to speak up for the men. 

 In most cases of violence against women, it is men who are the perpetrators of the violence. They commit the violent acts, support those who commit violence and then are usually complicit in the silence around these acts. Many incidents of violence against women go unreported. Yet, very often, women decide to protest. And what happens then? The incidents are trivialized, as it happened with me all those years ago. Women are often not believed. They are made to feel as though the violation did not occur. Or they are blamed for the violence. The focus shifts from the perpetrator to the victim-survivor. She has to answer whether she led him on, whether she provoked him, and so on. 

 This callous attitude to violence against women is not confined solely to family or community spaces. The justice system, too, is part of this tacit pact of upholding the silence around such violence. The police tell women that they are too busy to waste time on trifling matters. Women are advised to forget about lodging complaints and are often given misleading information about procedural matters. They are subjected to prurient questioning in courts.

 It is difficult to recall media campaigns asking men to confess to their crimes or asking male witnesses to give evidence in cases of violence against women. After all, violence against women is one of those murky areas of life that we would much rather keep quiet about. If we must protest against such violence, let us leave it to individual women or womens groups. 

 Jagannath deserves to be congratulated for raising his voice against the routine violence that most women, young or old, are subjected to in Calcutta. It is shocking that onlookers watched silently, but it is apparent that the assault on him took place in full public view. Obviously, there were many witnesses. 

 The media need their heroes and they have found one in Jagannath. It is unfortunate that Jagannaths protest is being projected as pain that he took on for a woman. Jagannath sees nothing wrong in exhorting the woman to come forward and speak on his behalf. He is contemptuous of the fact that the woman was quiet while the men were fighting in the bus. 

 When the woman was being harassed by her assailants, she did not protest. Like many of us in this city, she too probably thought that keeping quiet might bring an end to the nightmare. Isnt it unrealistic to expect her to become vocal in defence of her self-styled protectors? When onlookers intervene in situations of violence against women, they do it to affirm values of justice and humanity. It is presumptuous to construct this action as an individual favour to the victim. It is a matter of grave concern that violence against women is seen to be outside the civilizing rubric of peace and justice. 

 A small but significant fact seems to have got lost in the rhetoric around these incidents. Jagannath was not within striking distance of the men when he objected to their boorish behaviour. He marched up to them only after they abused him. I dont think it is correct to say that the violence was a consequence of the protest against the womans harassment alone. 

 It is indeed unfortunate that the media have decided to turn a concerned citizen into a disillusioned knight, who is sulking because he didnt get the lady. We have effortlessly ignored the trauma of the woman who was pawed in full public view. As we glorify the actions of this womans supposed rescuer, we join the smug multitude that places the onus of violence against women on women themselves.

 Haunted state 

Dangerous liaisons

 Sir The fact that power corrupts and corrupts absolutely has been proved once again by the Kavita Chaudhary murder case (Tale of sex, blackmail ends in teacher killing, Dec 26). Politicians and other VIPs will first indulge in illicit sex and then eliminate the woman they have been intimate with in order to protect their reputations. There is no dearth of politicians habitually exploiting their power to serve their personal interests. Neither do these leaders feel the pangs of conscience, as they lack ethical and humane values. What is shocking in this particular case is that the victim happens to be a teacher who destroyed her personal reputation and compromised her profession for money. It is unfortunate that the clandestine affair came to light only after Kavitas death. If the perpetrators had been caught earlier, at least the victims life could have been spared. Indian citizens, on their part, must demand an ever-vigilant judiciary to punish the offenders so that such crimes can be curbed. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Kavita Chaudharys murder exposes the dark underbelly of modern Indian society. Politicians in India are notorious for their involvement in sex-rackets. But a lecturers involvement this time round makes this particular case all the more disturbing. One really marvels at the ethical standards of a society in which teachers and politicians, the supposed guardians of social welfare, are neck deep in sleaze and crime. Only an exemplary punishment to the guilty in this case would make our politicians change their ways for the better.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Ravindra Pradhan, one of the accused in the murder of Kavita Chaudhary, may have been arrested. But Pradhans confident body language while facing the media and the fact that the Meerut senior superintendent of police, Navneet Sikera, allowed him to handle the uncomfortable questions hint at the fact that some powerful people are involved in this matter. Several inconsistencies are yet to be addressed though. For instance, Pradhan is believed to have said that after killing Kavita, he tied the corpse to heavy stones and dumped it in a canal. Then how is it that the police has failed to recover the body, especially as the stones would have prevented it from being dragged over a considerable distance? Besides, Kavitas brother claims to have spoken to her on December 7, although the police claim that the teacher had been murdered on October 24. Pradhan has since then gone on record with his claim that the Meerut police forced him to say what he did. His lawyer has said the same and the two of them claim that there are many politicians involved in the affair. In fact, it would make sense to carefully examine what Pradhan is saying now. It would then definitely give a different twist to this sordid case. If Kavitas body remains untraceable, the case would be weakened substantially. Perhaps, it would be a good idea for the Central Bureau of Investigation to take up the matter as the Uttar Pradesh police will function only under the directives of the state government.

 The haunting

 Sir In Who is the exorcist? (Dec 24), Rudrangshu Mukherjee raises some important points about Bengals industrial and economic development. Mukherjee is right when he says that the communists have always used bandhs as an instrument of protest. This, Mukherjee notes, has also contributed immensely to the industrial decline of the state. Things may be turning for the better but only a little. There is little doubt about the fact that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will find it difficult to woo investors unless he manages to win the left unions to his side. Unfortunately, bandhs have been such a success in West Bengal that now the opposition has also started to employ them as a mark of protest. Unless this vicious cycle is broken, Bhattacharjees sincere efforts will not bear fruit. The left unions must realize that they have to stop their disruptive practices. After all, investment provides the key to workers welfare that Citu claims to protect. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjee gives us an authentic history of bandhs in West Bengal in his article. Bandhs have tarnished the image of the state, almost to a point of no return. This weapon of popular protest, in response to some action or failure on the part of the administration, should ideally be used in extreme situations, and only when all other available means are exhausted. However, in West Bengal, politicians call bandhs indiscriminately, without sparing a thought for the suffering people. 

 The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seems to be genuinely interested in industrialization and job-creation. But it is doubtful whether he will be able to achieve his goals, thanks to the double standards in his own part. In fact, it would be a good idea if the chief minister were to now call a bandh against bandhs. Even then, people would stay indoors, thereby helping Bhattacharjee to exorcize the ghost of bandhs once and for all. Unfortunately for him, the policies drafted by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) are decided on the basis of the personal whims of politburo members. These men and their blighted vision are presumably more important than the economic welfare of the state of West Bengal.

 Yours faithfully

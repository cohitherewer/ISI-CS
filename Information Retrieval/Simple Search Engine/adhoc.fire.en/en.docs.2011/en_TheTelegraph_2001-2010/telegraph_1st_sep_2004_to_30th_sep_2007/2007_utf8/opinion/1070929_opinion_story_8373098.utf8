 JUDGES AND DETECTIVES

 It is always a good idea to keep in touch. Especially if the people with whom one keeps in touch are also ones voters and tax-payers. The chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said many things regarding the events surrounding the mysterious death of Rizwanur Rahman that seemed wise and sensitive. Mr Bhattacharjee spoke of the many angles to the tragedy, including a money angle and a communal angle. There may be some questions about the last; if anything, the responses of all citizens since the young mans death have demonstrated an emphatic lack of sectarianism. However, the chief ministers words were reassuring, his visage grim, and his expression determined when he said that no police officer would be protected. Had he been more in touch, he would have realized that words and body language are no longer enough to pacify an angry people, or to blunt the sharp questions being hurled at the police and the government. To make these statements and then ask the Criminal Investigation Department, manned by the state police, to conduct an inquiry into Rizwanurs death and the unlawful intervention in his life by the CIDs colleagues was a dead giveaway. As if this was not bad enough, the chief minister then asked for a judicial inquiry, to be headed by a retired judge, Aloke Chakraborty, who has in August also retired from his position as executive chairman of the West Bengal Legal Aid Services Committee. The derisive popular reaction to the second move may have suggested to him that he is not quite in touch.

 Or is he? Because it would have been so simple to arrange for an independent Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry at the very beginning. There would have been no need of the insistent public demand for CBI presence or a further erosion of credibility for the government and the police if any dregs of credibility are left at all. A judicial inquiry, even if conducted in the prescribed manner, with a request to the chief justice and the chief justices nomination of a sitting judge, takes years to complete and cannot, at its end, arrest the guilty. It can only recommend steps to the government, which is free to accept or reject them. Besides, why should a judge be made to conduct an inquiry in the first place? There are trained people to collect evidence in institutions created for that purpose alone; why encourage a fudging of roles?

 Mr Bhattacharjee, who was home (police) minister long before he became chief minister, cannot be unaware of the meaning of his decisions. None of the policemen whose actions should be inquired into has been suspended during the period of the inquiry. The public is bound to ask, what is there so damning that must be covered up by multiplying useless forms of inquiry while going against every norm and rule of investigation? As chief minister, Mr Bhattacharjee should be willing to answer this question; that is why he is chief minister.

 Hits and misses

 Sir Sonia jet in air-miss (Sept 19) shows how dangerous it is to cross the path of Indias most powerful woman. The special jet carrying Sonia Gandhi to Delhi is supposed to have come close to a Virgin Atlantic flight. However, as the civil aviation ministry has admitted, there was no possibility of a collision. Yet, a probe has been ordered and, worse, an air traffic control officer has been suspended even before the report is out. Wonder if the ministry would have shown the same alacrity had the jet carried ordinary mortals only. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A game in ruin

 Sir In the olden days, cricket was played at a leisurely pace. Matches were held once in a while and, unlike these days, they were not telecast live into our drawing rooms. Test matches were immensely popular, as were domestic ties that lasted three days. In the absence of television, cricket lovers used to throng the grounds to experience the action on the field. Then came one-day cricket, along with coloured clothing, white balls and action replays. It changed the gentlemans game forever. The crowds changed too. So did the cricketers, who now chose to play not for the love of the game but for the sake of money and fame. 

 With the emergence of Twenty20, even one-day cricket has become pass. This new version of the game is nothing but a sophisticated version of galli cricket. Already, with its cheerleaders, loud music and truncated matches, Twenty20 has rid cricket of its original charm. Now all that remains is for the game to lose some of its other charms such as a close contest between a technically sound batsman and an aggressive fast bowler. It is a pity that cricket is now being run purely for commercial gains. Its charms, as well as its reputation of being a game of glorious uncertainties, have been lost. The joy of real cricket can now only be savoured by browsing through the archives.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir I managed to watch a few games in the ongoing Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. On the basis of this experience, I have come to the following conclusion. A Test match is like a classic while a 50-over match is more like a racy story in a Sunday magazine. A Twenty20 match, however, is a different matter altogether. It is more like a shaggy dog story that makes everybody laugh for all the wrong reasons.

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Gupta,

 Sir True lovers of cricket are unlikely to find Twenty20 interesting. There is nothing artistic or aesthetics about this new form of cricket. Worse, the aspects that make Test and ODIs appealing are altogether absent in Twenty20. Whatever it is, Twenty20 is not cricket, call it by any other name you like.

 Yours faithfully,

Anil K. Choudhury,

 Sir India has done rather well in the Twenty20 World Cup. Few would have expected the team to make it to the semifinals. However, the credit for this commendable performance should go to the former coach, Greg Chappell, who had always talked about placing youth over experience. Thankfully, this time around, the Indian selectors took a cue from Chappells policy and decided to send a young team to South Africa. And the results are there for all to see. In fact, one needs to thank Rahul Dravid, the former captain, as well. For it was he who pressed upon the other two senior players not to play in this particular tournament. Had it not been for Dravid and Chappell, India would have certainly made a hasty exit from the Twenty20 World Cup as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

V.S. Giri, 

 Calcutta

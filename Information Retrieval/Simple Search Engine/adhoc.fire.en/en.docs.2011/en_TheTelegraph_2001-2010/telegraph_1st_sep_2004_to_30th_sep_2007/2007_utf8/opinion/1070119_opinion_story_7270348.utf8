 Learn the hard way

 Sir In Access to education (Jan 17), Andr Bteille has persuasively argued for equal opportunity of education. But he did not go into the fundamental causes of illiteracy, the alarming dropout rates in schools, the poor performance in universities or the politics of discrimination. Universal primary education often becomes impossible due to scarcity of schools in certain regions. The introduction of mid-day meals has increased attendance in schools, but there need to be more schools in underdeveloped areas. Parents, particularly in rural India, often discourage their children from attending schools since they do not consider education worthwhile. The poor also push their children into the labour market. The government, to keep to its goal of universal primary education, must deal with this problem.

 The liberalization of the economy and a better job scenario have given a boost to higher education. The bright are finding employment in the private sector. But even here, more needs to be done. Engineering colleges have increased, but there are not enough number of colleges to provide technical education or to teach skills. The number of seats are still higher in BE courses than in diploma courses in engineering. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Incheon, Republic of Korea

 Sir Financial constraints can hardly be an excuse for poor access to education. The main problem is the politicization of education. Like previous governments, the United Progressive Alliance, too, seems to have got busy with quotas. It should have been more concerned with the eradication of illiteracy. For this, schools in underdeveloped and rural areas need to be increased and more teachers trained and recruited.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Poor want kids in private schools (Nov 18, 2006), establishes the fact that the attendance rate may be higher in governmental schools but educational standards are higher in private schools. Besides, it is clear that the standard of education provided by private schools is consistent. It instills in the student a sense of responsibility, self-respect and, most important, the self-confidence to compete. Underprivileged parents, despite the financial strain, naturally feel they are getting value for the money spent in private education of their wards. And they cannot be blamed for dreaming of a better future.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Wish fulfilled

 Sir The University Grants Commission should be thanked for its one-time grant of Rs 86.55 lakh to the Calcutta University for the renovation and maintenance of the latters buildings (Corpus for CU campus upkeep, Jan 9). The University of Calcutta, one of the oldest universities in the country, is a prestigious seat of learning. It has recently been accredited to be a centre of excellence. The UGC also released Rs 30 crore in recognition of this achievement. The vision report, prepared by the university, listing the ways in which it intends to utilize the fund, was examined by a 12-member UGC team, which noted the dismal condition of the campus buildings. Hence this special grant, which the university plans to invest in the renovation of the College Street and Rajabazar campuses. The repair work will certainly benefit the students, faculty and staff members. We would also be looking forward to a day when a cleaner and less congested College Street would be possible. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ranesh Chandra Dey, Melbourne

 Sir By bestowing a special grant on the Calcutta University, the UGC has set a precedence. The amount was much-needed, given that both the College Street and Rajabazar campuses of the university are more than a century old. The fact that Calcutta University was given this privilege shows that this institution is still held in high esteem for the standards of academic excellence it has set along the years. One would expect the authorities to spend the grant judiciously.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The report, Wake-up call in girl child deaths (Dec 25, 2006), is a harsh reminder that despite all claims to the contrary, the primitive mindset of most Indians has not changed much. The appalling imbalance in the male-female ratio in Punjab is indicative of the failure of the administration as well as of the refusal of society to reform itself. While there may be several reasons for the decrease in the number of the girl-child in Punjab, a great deal of the blame rests with the mothers themselves. Having conceded to the demands of society, they consider their daughters a curse. So they either kill them or neglect them. The deputy commissioner of Nawanshar in Punjab, Krishan Kumar, has made a commendable effort in reversing the dismal male-female ratio in the district. More dedicated officers like him are needed to prevent further deaths of girl children in the state. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

LEGAL

 Not for free

 A man complained to the district consumer forum about medical negligence at an ESI hospital. Both the district and the state forum refused to entertain his complaint on the ground that the services rendered by ESI hospitals are ldquo;gratuitous rdquo; and persons receiving services free of cost are not included within the definition of ldquo;consumer rdquo; under the Consumer Protection Act. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that such a complaint could be entertained under the Act. The ESI hospitals treat only those who contribute to the Employees rsquo; State Insurance scheme. So such treatment is not ldquo;gratuitous rdquo; or free, the court held. The court sent the case back to the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum for a fresh trial (Kishore Lal vs ESI Corporation).

 Death by fire

 In a case of bride-burning, the conviction of the mother-in-law and brother-in-law (based on the bride rsquo;s dying declaration) was challenged in the Supreme Court. One of the grounds was that the dying declaration could not be relied upon as the woman did not die immediately after the FIR but about 25 days later. The Supreme Court held that a dying declaration will not cease to be one just because the victim survived for nearly a month after the incident. Any statement made by a person who cannot be found or is dead and is incapable of giving evidence is to be considered a dying declaration, the court ruled, and upheld the conviction (Maniben vs State of Gujarat).

 Power play

 In Kerala, a sales tax of 12.5 per cent was charged on electrical goods as well as home appliances such as pressure cookers, water filters and casseroles. When the sales tax on electrical goods was reduced to 10 per cent, the manufacturers of an appliance that used electricity to filter water applied for reduction of the sales tax. Its application was rejected as the concerned authorities held that since the principal task of the appliance was to filter water, it was a home appliance and not an electrical good. Kerala High Court, however, held that the appliance was an electrical good as the process by which it purified water could not be operated without electricity (Eureka Forbes Ltd vs State of Kerala).

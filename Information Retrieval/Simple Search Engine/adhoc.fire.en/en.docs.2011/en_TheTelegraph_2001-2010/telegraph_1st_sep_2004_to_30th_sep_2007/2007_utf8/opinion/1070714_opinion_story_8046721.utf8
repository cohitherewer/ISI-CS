 EMPTY WORDS FLOW HEAVENWARDS

 THIS ABOVE ALL - 

KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Use your brains

 My grandmother used to say her morning prayer while churning a large earthen pot to make buttermilk. She often paused to examine its contents, to see how it was turning out. I wondered if her mind was more in makkhan and lassi or in prayer.

 My mother said her morning prayer while doing household chores. She often gave orders to servants or told us to hurry up and get ready for school. I wondered if her mind was in her prayer or in mundane affairs. 

 My father said his morning prayer while taking his bath. He was equally devoted to pouring water over his body, soaping and washing off the lather. I wondered what pre-occupied him more cleaning his body or his soul.

 A distant relative who was a keen golfer said his morning prayer while driving to the golf club. I wondered if his mind was on the road, on the traffic signals or on what he was reciting by rote. I felt that this was not the right way to pray and that there was a point in the Hindu tradition of sitting padmaasan, lotus-posed, in complete silence with eyes closed and concentrating on the meaning of the verses one chants. Many Sikhs do the same: they take their prayers seriously and do not treat them as a routine ritual.

 This is more pertinent when it comes to congregational prayers. Islam emphasizes the need for everyone to join namaaz in mosques. Besides blurring individual status, it creates a sense of brotherhood. So also do assemblages in temples and gurudwaras. The sangat becomes a fraternity of the like-minded. Sikh gurus laid great emphasis on sangat and pangat, eating together in the guru-ka-langar. A popular form of prayer is to recite it aloud in a sing-song manner. It has its own charm but the sound often smothers the sense inherent in the words.

 Guru Nanak, although supporting sangat prayers and keertans, was very particular about understanding the meaning of the words of prayers. He wrote: 

 Aklee sahib seveeai aklee paayey

 maan

 Aklee parh kay bujheeay

 Aklee keechey daan

 Nanak aakhai Raah eh

 Hore gallan Shaitaan

 Use your brains while

 worshipping the Lord

 Use your brains and 

 earn merit

 Use your brains while 

 giving the charity

 Thus says Nanak is the real way

 The rest is all the Devils sway

 In another verse Guru Nanak was more downright in condemning those who parroted prayers without trying to understand what the words meant; he called them fools:

 Na Sudh na budh, na akl Sar

 Akkhar ka bheo na lahant

 Nanak, say nar asl khar

 Jo bin gun garab karant

 They have no awareness, no

 knowledge, no brains in their heads

 They do not care not to find the inner secret of words they pray;

 They are real donkeys, 

 does Nanak say.

 Mystic masseur

 I have to periodically visit the beauty parlour of the hotel Le Meridien to have my feet pedicured. I am no longer able to cut my own toenails. With age nails become harder and harder and need to be soaked in warm soapy water to make them soft enough to be clipped by a man with strong hands. I look forward to these visits because besides seeing which trees are in flower at the time, I also get a chance to observe the people in the parlour who come for hair cuts, shaves, facials, manicure and pedicure. What I enjoy most is what follows the clipping of toenails and the scraping of dirty, dead flesh on the feet the oil and cream massage of the soles and legs from ankles to the knees. It is so sensuous and soothing that I have to prevent myself from nodding off to sleep. I do so with the assurance I will sleep soundly during the siesta. It is a most relaxing exercise.

 The last time I was at the parlour, I saw a middle-aged businessman undergoing simultaneous treatments because he evidently wanted to get over them as fast as he could to return to his office. He lay sprawled in a rotating chair. A hairdresser was clipping his hair, a barber giving him a shave, a pedicurist massaging his feet. Every few minutes he would free his right hand from the manicurists grip, pick up his cell phone and ring up his office to give instructions. Then he jotted something on a pad. He interrupted his shaver and manicurist at least four times in the half-hour I was sitting facing him. He was obviously a regular customer who left handsome tips for the men attending him. They kept their mouths shut. I wanted to shout, Silly ass! Dont you know how to relax? Your business will not go to pieces if you take a short break.

 As we grow old and are unable to take the exercise required to keep the body in reasonable shape, a good alternative is to get a massage done regularly. I have it twice a week with oil and cream. I have an expert masseur who knows where tensions build up in those who lead sedentary lives: behind the neck and between the shoulders. A vigorous rub along the spinal cord really tones up the body. When having a massage a person should concentrate on the part of the body being ministered to and not think of anything else. Ideally, it should be done in complete silence. Unfortunately, my masseur, although he does a great job, is a non-stop talker. I have no choice but to let him babble on and on; otherwise he would cut short the exercise and leave me frustrated. The day I have a massage followed by a hot bath with a loofah to scrub off the oil, I sleep like the proverbial log lost to the world.

 Metamorphosis of a politician

 There was this agriculture minister

 Whose inactivity was quite 

 sinister:

 The World Cup loss

 Sent him for a toss,

 And he became an angry culture

 minister.

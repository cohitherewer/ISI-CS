 - Physics in fine print

 William Blake, The Ancient of Days

 THE UNIVERSE: A BIOGRAPHY 

 By John Gribbin,

 Allen Lane, 20 

 Physics, particularly the theoretical branch of it, is getting a bad press these days. Maybe, say some commentators, it is paying the price of its own success. Having explained the weird goings-on within everything from atoms to stars, its foray into the unknown seems to have hit a wall. The Standard Model, an ensemble of great ideas cobbled together for many years, has not yielded any spectacular result for more than a decade now. And string theory, touted for nearly a quarter of a century as the mother of all theories that eluded even Albert Einstein, is being pooh-poohed by its critics as only mind-boggling maths with no relevance to reality. What a let-down!

 In The Universe, which is the British edition of The Origins of the Future: Ten Questions for the Next Ten Years, published in America last year, Gribbin, an old hand at science writing, inadvertently provides more grist to the mill. As is clear from the subtitle of the books American edition, his main goal was to answer some of the most important existential questions: How did the universe begin? What holds the cosmos together? Where did the material particles we are made of come from? How did life begin? How will everything end one day? and so on. A tough call no doubt, and Gribbin realized that he was ending up with only tentative answers. Why? 

 When I started writing books about science, more than thirty years ago, it seemed to me that I was dealing with clear-cut facts, things like Newtons law, the way continents move about the surface of the Earth, how stars release energy and so on, writes Gribbin. But as he increasingly turned his attention to the history of science, he became intrigued by the way in which such investigations are necessarily, to some extent, subjective and open to interpretation. He realized, rather late in the day, that it was impossible to write the history of science, because we do not have all the facts; we have to fill in the gaps with guesswork, even if it is educated guesswork making full use of all the facts we do have. The predicament offered Gribbin an excuse to call the British edition of his book a biography of the cosmos, because, he argues, the fallibility of human memory and paucity of records also make all human biographies incomplete.

 Of all the ten chapters in The Universe, the introductory one is the most revealing. The authors take on How Do We Know the Things We Think We Know? is an extension of Bertrand Russells comment mentioned at the beginning of the book: It is not what the man of science believes that distinguishes him, but how and why he believes it. His beliefs are tentative, not dogmatic; they are based on evidence, not on authority or intuition. According to Gribbin, what scientists mean when they say they know how something works is that they have a mental image a model, if you will of its operation. What makes the model a scientific one is that it matches the results of the experiments involving that object. Also, a model is valid only as long as tests do not fail it.

 So far, so good, but reality is hardly so simple. For example, what to make of light, our most immediate companion in everyday life? Is it a wave or a collection of particles? We are told that it is both. Why? Because it behaves as if it were a wave in all experiments to detect its wavy nature, just as it behaves as if it were composed of particles in those that can identify its graininess. There is no paradox or conflict here, insists Gribbin, the limitations lie in our models and our human imagination, because we are trying to describe something that is, in its entirety, unlike anything we have experienced with our own senses. He quotes the Nobel-laureate physicist, Richard Feynman, who called the bafflement of ordinary mortals with trying to visualize light both as a wave and a bag of grains a reflection of an uncontrolled but vain desire to see it in terms of something familiar.

 Trying to understand what everything in this world, including us, is made of also stretches credulity beyond limits. Smart money is on the idea that the ultimate constituents of all matter are not point-like particles, but extended objects, called strings. They are tiny, incredibly tiny, and measure only a hundred thousand billion billion billionth of a millimetre in length. Thousands of theoretical physicists all over this planet have staked their career on the beauty of these strings, which, they say, dance in 11 or 26 dimensions.

 Believing in their existence, we are told, makes nature utterly simple in that there will be only one formula small enough, some claim, to be inscribed on a beer mug to dictate the behaviour of an electron as well as a galaxy. (Right now there are two separate laws for that.) OK, but any proof that strings exist? Oh, no, there is absolutely no way to detect them directly, the only option is to test the predictions of their effects on the scale of things available around us. It doesnt matter whether or not the world really is made of tiny strings, only whether or not it behaves as if it were made of tiny strings, Gribbin writes in fine print as if to clinch the issue.

 One need not be an Einstein to object to such mind-boggling models of reality, but it certainly helps to know that the great man also did not want to bargain mere models for the truth. True, if science is all about model-making, then why bother?

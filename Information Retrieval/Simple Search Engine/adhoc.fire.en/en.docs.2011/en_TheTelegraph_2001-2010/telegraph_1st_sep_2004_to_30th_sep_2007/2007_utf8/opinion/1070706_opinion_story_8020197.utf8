 LOOKING GOOD IN BORROWED FEATHERS

 Bookwise

 Special deal

For all the hype about Indian writing in English, it is educational books that still provide the bread-and-butter for the Indian book trade. Over 80 per cent of the turnover of leading Indian publishers comes from textbooks that have a captive market with high profit margins.

 Moreover, English language publishing in any subject is still dependent on the acquisition of reprint rights from British and American publishers. We are not, in most cases, the originators of the book. So let us try to dispel some of the myths about English language publishing. 

 First, what does origination mean, because this is the acid test to determine the strengths (and weaknesses) of the publishing industry? Second, is there a way to lessen our dependence on reprint rights, or special deals, that make books available at cheaper prices for the Indian market? It is necessary to ask these questions because after 60 years of independence we are still heavily dependent on imported materials. Could we develop an indigenous programme to cover our overheads and provide for expansion plans?

 Origination (in publishing parlance, the place where the original idea was conceived and the manuscript turned into a printed and bound book), is the statutory information printed on the reverse of the title page of all books which states where the book was first published and the year of its publication. Increasingly, the place of origin is found to be the United States of America, with reprint rights leased out to British publishers, which in turn, services the Indian market by leasing out secondary reprint rights. This sub-leasing is done because of the territorial arrangements that American and British publishers have made between themselves.

 For example, Jhumpa Lahiris The Namesake has just been turned into a film. The book was first published in the US by Houghton Mifflin, and by HarperCollins in Britain, from where it arrived here through a special deal. This means that we need to negotiate with the British publisher, not with the originator.

 On what terms does the Indian publisher negotiate for reprint rights/special deals? What should the down payment or the royalties on sales be, and for what duration can the copyright be retained by the Indian publisher? British publishers are not too sticky about down payments or royalties, but are reluctant to give away rights on a permanent basis or subsidiary rights for films and television. 

 Will we become more self-sufficient in the coming years? Not likely, for two reasons. First, because Indian scholars do not seem to have the intellectual stamina or doggedness of foreign scholars. Second, Indian scholars feel it is infra dig to write texts for the average student. Finally, getting reprint rights is an easy way out for Indian publishers. So, be prepared to see more and more reprints rather than home-grown originals.

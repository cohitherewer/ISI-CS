 FORCING CHANGE

 How much funding does the theory of global warming attract? For global warming is a theory, not a fact, say the scientists who support the thesis behind Michael Crichtons unusual thriller about environmental terrorism, State of Fear, which raises this question. Since 2004, when Crichton wrote the novel, complete with appendices, notes and graphs, more and more scientists are speaking up against the panic created by the greenhouse gases orthodoxy, which the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change has done most to spread. According to many of them, as for Crichton, global warming is the latest end-of-the-world myth, a religion rather than science: mans survival is in his own hands he had better stop emitting greenhouse gases, or else. Yet global warming, says one of Crichtons characters, is the theory that increased levels of carbon dioxide and certain other gases are causing an increase in the average temperature of the earths atmosphere because of the so-called greenhouse effect.

 The contradiction between the IPCCs proposition and the group of scientists who insist that mans actions have very little, if anything at all, to do with climate change, appears to be absolute. The theory of global warming seems to have slipped between the two stools of climatology and meteorology. The study of weather patterns is very different from the study of climate change. The latter has to be looked at in the perspective of a very long past, and must take account of, for example, the Little Ice Age. The warming after that is not fully explained yet, just as the causes for the LIA are not known either. With so many forcing factors still unknown, it is impossible to find sole causes for temperature rise and fall within the context of a few hundred years. Many changes, such as in the directions of ocean currents, are taking place anyway. As for human agency, another simple example will suffice. Most of the warming in the past century occurred before 1940, before CO2 emissions could have been a major factor. Temperatures fell between 1940 and 1970, when CO2 levels were increasing. At best, according to this point of view, human agency is one of 15 known factors related to climate change, and then it is far from being a primary one.

 Even if it is not just a question of the funding that global warming attracts, the issues do come down to big money, now and in the future. The politics between the North and the South being played out around the theory has now become a crucial factor in trade agreements and pressure tactics, especially regarding the two emerging economies of China and India. On the other side, a calm acceptance of natural determinism is not a solution. Preserving natural resources, solving the growing food problem, trying not to worsen conditions, need active and conscious human participation. Science should not provide an alibi for pollution and destruction.

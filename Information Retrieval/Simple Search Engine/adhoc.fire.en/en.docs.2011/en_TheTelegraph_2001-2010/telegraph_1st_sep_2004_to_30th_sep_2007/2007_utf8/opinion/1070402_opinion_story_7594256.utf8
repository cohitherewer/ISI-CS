 BOLD STEPS

 To a world terrorized by violent ideologies, the execution of six Islamist leaders in Bangladesh should be a sign of hope. Terrorists of all hues love to invoke some religious, political or other creed. The executed leaders and their men abused Islam in order to let loose a reign of terror on Bangladesh over the past few years. All modern values and every sort of freedom were these fanatics targets. What was even more worrying, these forces of evil thrived on the connivance of the government of the former prime minister, Begum Khaleda Zia. Between them and her colluding regime, they turned Bangladesh into a failed state. The international community cried foul and grimly warned of Bangladesh becoming the next Afghanistan. But corrupt politicians busied themselves with making money and settling small partisan scores. The executions are one more proof of the army-backed interim governments commitment to rid the country of the forces of evil. It had earlier raised hopes of a genuine clean-up by arresting over 150 corrupt politicians, the most notable of them being Ms Zias son, Tarique Rahman. By ignoring threats of a backlash against the executions, it has set an example for governments everywhere. It is almost certain that no elected government would have dared to take such bold steps. 

 The timing of the executions is significant. They come on the eve of the summit meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in New Delhi. While the world worried about the rise of Islamist militancy in Bangladesh, it had devastating effects on the countrys relationship with India. Bangladesh became the conduit for terrorist attacks inside India. New Delhi should have no problems in dealing with an army-backed regime in Dhaka if the latter sends out positive signals. In fact, relations between the two countries had long been hostage to Bangladeshs domestic politics. A non-political government in Dhaka is free from such compulsions. New Delhi can now hope to do serious business on some bilateral issues. The most important of these is the issue of the camps of militant groups from Indias North-east inside Bangladeshi territory. Trade and transit also need to be re-opened. Before everything else, though, Bangladeshs drift into anarchy must stop.

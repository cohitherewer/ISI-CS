 MEDIEVAL LITTLE 

 INDIAS 

 - Benefits to the creamy layer are essential to the quota 

 plan 

 Ashok Guha

 Consanguinity and community of 

 economic interests are the factors that most effectively 

 bind a group together. Endogamy and a common occupation 

 within each caste were the pillars of our caste system. 

 They consolidated each caste into a rigid and exclusive 

 brotherhood with its own rules and its own leadership, a 

 fraternity that lasted countless generations and gave the 

 caste system a durability that few other social structures 

 have achieved in human history. They also ensured that each 

 caste was so wrapped up in its own concerns and so hostile 

 to others that no sense of Indianness emerged until centuries 

 of racist colonial domination created a shared grievance 

 against a common enemy. 

 The colonial masters have gone. 

 Since their departure the divisive effects of the caste 

 system have been steadily dissipating the sense of nationhood 

 that their rule created despite the existence today of the 

 countervailing forces of economic growth, urbanization and 

 industrialization. The latter have induced occupational 

 and regional mobility and fostered a degree of anonymity 

 that weakens kinship and caste ties. In urban, industrial 

 India, new economic alignments are emerging. Even inter-caste 

 marriage, that ultimate solvent of the system, has made 

 a timid beginning. 

 Two factors have however diluted 

 the impact of growth and helped the preservation and reassertion 

 of caste identities. First, there is the yet-localized and 

 limited nature of economic growth: vast tracts of the Hindi 

 heartland (including all Uttar Pradesh and Bihar), the tribal 

 belts of Rajasthan, central and eastern India as well as 

 the inaccessible North-east remain outside its pale, steeped 

 in essentially agrarian economies with age-old traditions 

 and power-structures. In this huge part of our world, traditional 

 caste roles are still socially enforced and murder of couples 

 who have the temerity to stray outside their castes is routine. 

 This, of course, is a transient factor. As the mainstream 

 of growth broadens and engulfs more of the country and its 

 population, its eroding effect on caste is bound to intensify. 

 Far longer lasting however will 

 be the consequences of deliberate mobilization of caste 

 identities by politicians in search of a power base. All 

 politicians are shrewd enough to realize that merely invoking 

 caste loyalties cuts no ice with the electorate, particularly 

 when the opposition could do likewise. Loaves and fishes, 

 or at least expectations of loaves and fishes, howsoever 

 seldom fulfilled, are needed as well and caste quotas 

 constitute the ideal instrument for the distribution of 

 these goodies. Social justice provides the perfect fig-leaf 

 for this exercise in electoral bribery. And once a politician 

 or a political party begins this game, as V.P. Singh did 

 for the Mandal castes in 1989, Pandoras box is well and 

 truly open: the compulsions of electoral competition ensure 

 that all others must willy-nilly follow suit. 

 For the ideologues of caste-based 

 reservations, quotas are intended to rectify the inequalities 

 implicit in the hierarchic structure of the caste system. 

 The fact that at least 90 per cent of the educational and 

 employment benefits from a caste quota are captured by the 

 microscopic elite within the targeted caste is regarded 

 by them as a deplorable but minor flaw (which can be easily 

 corrected) in a grand egalitarian scheme. 

 Quota politicians know better. 

 They know that benefits for the creamy layer are not unintended 

 and dispensable by-products of the scheme but essential 

 to its very design. One must give credit where credit is 

 due. Quotas were fashioned by politicians, not by ideologues, 

 and their primary purpose was achievement, not of equality, 

 but of caste consolidation. Sixty years of reservations 

 have not improved the relative status of our scheduled castes, 

 but they have produced a Mayavati at the helm of a militant 

 SC movement. The Mandal movement has not reduced inequality 

 anywhere, but it has transformed the politics of UP and 

 Bihar into an open display of caste conflict with shifting 

 patterns of coalitions and alliances among the warring castes. 

 National parties are increasingly irrelevant on this battlefield 

 because they have preoccupations other than caste. Even 

 governance issues matter little in these states, as the 

 long tenure of Lalu Prasad in Bihar demonstrated. As for 

 corruption, the pervasive venality of the Indian politician 

 has long devalued this as an electoral issue: where everyone 

 will surely steal, why shouldnt I vote for the thief of 

 my caste rather than the thief of yours? 

 Quotas, while failing conspicuously 

 in their overt purpose of uplifting the least advantaged, 

 have thus been supremely successful in their hidden agenda, 

 the consolidation of caste identities and the caste vote. 

 And effective caste consolidation requires a strong caste 

 leadership with adequate resources; only such a leadership 

 can direct the manoeuvrings of the caste vote bloc or formulate 

 and enforce a coherent course of action for the whole caste. 

 Exclusion of the creamy layer from quota benefits would 

 not only totally contradict the personal interests of the 

 leadership; it would also drive a palpable wedge between 

 the interests of the leadership and the perceived interests 

 of its flock that would undermine the credibility of the 

 former. Little wonder therefore that, the laments of the 

 quota ideologues notwithstanding, the creamy layer has kept 

 its tight hold over quota benefits intact over the six decades 

 spanned by reservation policy. Indeed, it is now supposed 

 to be a standard argument for the retention of this hold 

 (articulated, for instance, quite openly and unashamedly 

 by Ram Vilas Paswan) that, if the creamy layer is excluded, 

 90 per cent of seats and jobs allotted to the quota castes 

 would remain vacant. Clearly, the protagonists of reservation 

 policy know who are its real beneficiaries and consciously 

 wield it, not as an instrument of equality, but as a rallying 

 cry to unite their castes behind them. 

 Unite for what purpose? At best 

 for savage electoral bouts like those between those accomplished 

 wrestlers, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati. But away from 

 the limelight of these well-refereed electoral dangas, 

 in obscure towns and villages, an undeclared caste war rages 

 between the landed other backward classes and their Thakur 

 allies, and the landless SCs a war that ensures that UP 

 and Bihar remain the most criminalized states in the country. 

 Not that the Hindi belt is unique 

 as a caste battlefield. The clashes between the Vanniyars 

 and the other OBCs in Tamil Nadu, the Lingayats and the 

 Vokkaligas in Karnataka, the Kammas and the Reddys in Andhra 

 Pradesh and between all of these castes and the Dalits in 

 all these states have become endemic. The Naxalite insurgency 

 that now engulfs all of tribal Andhra, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, 

 Jharkhand and Bihar is primarily a war of scheduled tribes 

 against essentially OBC landowners. The North-east is simmering 

 with countless tribal mutinies, demanding autonomy, sometimes 

 for groups that number only a handful. And northern India 

 a mere fortnight ago watched pitched battles over reservations 

 between armed mobs 50,000 strong who had to be separated 

 by the army. 

 In their quest for personal political 

 strongholds, the politicians have indeed fragmented the 

 country into a thousand Little Indias, each in determined 

 and militant pursuit of its narrow interests. And if only 

 they can paralyse the growth process (as Arjun Singh in 

 his determined assault on quality in education and industry 

 threatens to do), they will have succeeded in returning 

 the country to a medieval anarchy in which caste was the 

 only reality. Social justice would then have been well 

 and truly served.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SACRED AND 

 PROFANE 

 BONAFIDE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Lets 

 channel-surf. Breaking news continues to be the same old 

 stale information about Pratibha Patil.

 As the saga of the battle for 

 the presidency unfolds, and as all kinds of charges are 

 exchanged, Karan Singh seems to have been the only candidate 

 with a clean reputation amongst those short-listed. But 

 the Left ruled him out and started this farce that India 

 is witnessing. To have had Karan Singh, the former maharaja 

 of Jammu and Kashmir, as the president of India, while the 

 world is busy disputing whether the state is an integral 

 part of our nation or not, would have made a salutary, silent 

 and strong political statement. But, alas, subtle political 

 symbolism is not something contemporary politicos comprehend. 

 As the heir apparent to the throne of Jammu and Kashmir, 

 Karan Singh was close to Jawaharlal Nehru, who called him 

 Tiger. When India gained independence, Jammu and Kashmir 

 became a part of the federal republic and Karan Singh became 

 the sadr-i-riyasat. Karan Singh earned his doctorate 

 by writing his thesis on Sri Aurobindo. He is not one of 

 those fakes who have had an honourary degree bestowed upon 

 them merely because of their social or political position, 

 rather than because of their intellectual endeavours. Cultured, 

 dignified and erudite, he was the ideal person for the job 

 and would, most certainly, have protected the Constitution, 

 which is the prime responsibility of the president of India. 

 To have disqualified him because he was an erstwhile royal 

 only exposes the petty parameters within which the Left 

 opposition selfishly operates in a modern, open environment.

 Shifting house

 It was remarkable to see the Blair 

 family outside 10 Downing Street, allowing the next incumbent, 

 Gordon Brown, and his family to move into the prime ministers 

 official residence. This never happens in India. Either 

 our leaders hang on to government property indefinitely 

 till they are forcibly evicted, or the residences turn into 

 museums. Three years ago, it took over a month for Atal 

 Bihari Vajpayee to move out of Race Course Road, the official 

 residence of the prime minister, while another government 

 property was being done up for him to occupy as a former 

 prime minister. The whole thing is a bit of a joke. Former 

 prime ministers live off the land till they depart. They 

 sit about with their families in government mansions, where 

 they spend their spare time manipulating and scheming, playing 

 divisive politics all at the cost of the country. Possibly 

 we are the last bastion where the government gives its babus, 

 all members of the upper and lower houses of parliament, 

 and members of all irrelevant commissions, free or subsidized 

 accommodation. Corruption starts here, at home. This freebie 

 must end and with it, government expenditure will fall dramatically. 

 Human face divine

 Finally we have our very own genre 

 of pop art. I cannot, for the life of me, understand the 

 mad frenzy of some people as they protest against those 

 poster wallahs who have produced inventive visuals 

 of our leaders, depicting them as characters from the ancient 

 legends of Bharat. The belief in the divinity of man is 

 a great and ancient philosophic faith, one that has allowed 

 Hindustan to stand apart from other nations over the centuries. 

 Hindu gods and goddesses have a human face, have human characteristics 

 and human follies. The loud rhetorical declamations by the 

 band of conservative, holier-than-thou, self-appointed arbiters 

 of fresh cultural expressions are restrictive and unwarranted. 

 Liberty needs careful nurturing and any assault on it will 

 constrict creativity and thus create an antithesis to the 

 great traditions, past and present, of akhand Bharat.

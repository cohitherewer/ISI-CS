The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Cities within the city

 Shadows, bursts of colour, a city still steeped in traditions, never mind the malls and flyovers. This is the face of Calcutta that Leena Kejriwal chooses to capture in CALCUTTA: REPOSSESSING THE CITY (Om, Price not mentioned), which takes us on a journey of cities within the city. With occasional flashes of brilliance, we catch glimpses of bazaars, dry cleaning stores (left), gritty old railways quarters (middle), pujas, icons, aristocratic houses and ethnic groups. Evidently, Kejriwal loves and knows her city well. She turns Calcuttas two favourite modes of transport into a blur of light and colour as if they were spectral beings. But it is the spectacular birds-eye view of Raj Bhavan, the opulence of interiors be it the Coffee House, a thakurdalan, or a clockmakers shop and the charm of the little old lady buying fritters (bottom) that are unforgettable.

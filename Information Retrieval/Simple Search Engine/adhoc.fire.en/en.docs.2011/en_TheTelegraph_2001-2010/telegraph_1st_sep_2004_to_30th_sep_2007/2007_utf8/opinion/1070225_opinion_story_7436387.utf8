The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Nobodys child

 Sir The photograph of a coffin carrying an unidentified childs body at the Wagah checkpost was deeply disturbing (Feb 23). If it was not possible to establish the identity of the dead child, what could have prompted the Indian government to hand over the body to Pakistan? How did the authorities come to the conclusion that the body belonged to a Pakistani national? What if an Indian passenger proves his claim to the body a few days later? Will the government be able then to retrieve it from Pakistan?

 Yours faithfully,

 On their own

 Sir It was with great dismay that I read the news of a young tribal mother facing harassment be- cause she needed a place to breastfeed her child during the Madhyamik examination (Exam insult to infants mother, Feb 23). The comments made by some teachers to the effect that allowing her to breastfeed would encourage early marriage are ludicrous. This incident has taken place in a state which is still struggling to bring girls to school and keep them there. West Bengal has also lagged behind in effective implementation of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The third National Family Health Survey data recently compiled for the state show clearly that exclusive breast-feeding rates for infants below 6 months of age go up significantly with an increase in the number of years of education of the mother. 

 This incident only brings to the fore the inflexibility and lack of understanding that are the characteristics of the administration when dealing with tribal and other such socially disadvantaged communities. We are wrong in blaming ignorant parents for their daughters not going to school. The problem is largely one of supply and not of demand. The systems that deliver education are not ready in many cases.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Is it ethical to question the safety of women in national capital when adult, mature women voluntarily walk up to the den of their potential rapists (Computer student held for rape, Feb 23)? What do we expect law-enforcers to do? Surely they cannot infringe on ones right to spend the night with the person of ones choice? Every society has its own value systems, however sexist or politically incorrect they may appear to be. If an adult lady expects Indian men to talk through the night with her in a closed room, she does so at her own peril, as did the woman mentioned in the report. The line dividing consensual sex between adults and rape is thin, often blurred. As a parent, I feel worried at the news. Should I advise my son to get the nod of a woman recorded on non-judicial stamp paper before a sexual encounter? Things are perhaps moving in that direction.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Papered over

 Sir A lot of changes have taken place in The Telegraph, not all of which are pleasing. I most certainly miss Pakshi Vasudevas sane talk and the old format of the bullion. Sundays are also not the same without the Quick Crossword. 

 Yours faithfully,

Alo Ray, Calcutta

 Sir I am one of the sincere readers of The Telegraph, particularly its free Monday supplement, Knowhow. I thought it had carved out an identity of its own. But since February 2, when T2 was introduced, Knowhow has become just another section of the main paper. But Telekids is still given separately. Any other change is welcome, but many readers will be pleased if Knowhow goes back to its tabloid format, like Telekids. 

 Yours faithfully,

Manali Roy, Calcutta

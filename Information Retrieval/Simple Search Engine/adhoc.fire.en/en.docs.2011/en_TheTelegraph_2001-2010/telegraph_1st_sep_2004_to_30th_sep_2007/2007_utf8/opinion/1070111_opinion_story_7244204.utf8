 Apologies make for good public relations, but unfortunately do not help in solving problems. The well-meaning chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, would do well to remember this. What he faces today, in the context of the events in Nandigram, is a colossal failure of his administration. The government of West Bengal handled the entire Nandigram episode in a manner that would suggest that it went into the area blindfolded. It had not worked out the implications of setting up a special economic zone in the area. What is worse is that it was unaware of the opposition that was growing in the area, and of the arms pile-up that was taking place. Thus, when the outburst came, the administration was caught totally on the wrong foot. No apology can hide this incompetence of the administration. What the chief minister must ensure and this is far more important and critical than saying sorry is that there should be no recurrence of this kind of administrative failure. This may not be as easy as it sounds.

 The bureaucracy in West Bengal, to judge by its performance, does not exactly inspire confidence. It is slow, hesitant to take decisions, and constantly looking over its shoulders to seek the approval of politicians, especially those belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). It is completely unsuited to handling issues that might arise out of Mr Bhattacharjees grand vision of the state. Yet, without an efficient administration, the chief minister can hardly expect to bring his vision to earth. It is not that West Bengal does not have civil servants, but most of them seem to be struck by ennui. One option that Mr Bhattacharjee has is the creation of a chief ministers office along the lines of the prime ministers office in New Delhi. Such a body of mandarins could be assigned the responsibility of evaluating problems that could follow from a policy decision. It could also be given the task of implementing policy. What Mr Bhattacharjee lacks today is an efficient delivery mechanism and an institutionalized process to look into the details of policy. A CMO could take care of all these aspects of administration. If Mr Bhattacharjee decides to create a CMO, he would be well advised to think of a senior member of the Indian Foreign Service to head the office. Such an office could save him from future apologies, and more.

 Letters to Editor

 Billion does not care

 Sir The newest term in Indian cricket is blue billion, popularized by a soft drink company. Even in interviews, such as the ones by L.P. Sahi, stars like Sachin Tendulkar are asked about the expectations of a billion (A guarantee each of us will put best foot forward, Mar 3). But the fact is, only a fraction of this billion is interested in cricket. In our villages, where more than 70 per cent of Indians live, it is an insect called cricket that is a greater reality than the game. Rural Indians do not have time for the wasteful cricket-euphoria of their urban cousins.

 Yours faithfully,

 Mayajit Mazumdar, Kharagpur

 Count the blessings

 Sir Although I subscribe to two financial papers and another English daily, I am yet to see such a thought-provoking alternative budget as the one Ashok V. Desai has presented in The Telegraph. But I would like to pick a fight with P. Chidambarams budget on one of its many allocations. He has given only Rs 50 crore for diabetes and heart attack awareness programmes. These two account for nearly half a million deaths annually in India (Out of polio shadow, Mar 1). And as much as Rs 969 crore is going to be spent on AIDS programmes and AIDS causes far less deaths. Besides, half a million babies die every year because of the lack of proper sanitation and healthcare services. Woudnt some money from the AIDS programmes have been better utilized on these?

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh K. Rathi, Calcutta

 Sir After giving a patient hearing to the finance minister on Budget Day, I can say only one thing to sum up his budget proposals: Biscuits for doberman, nothing for common man(What a miss, PC! Mar 1). As the United Progressive Alliance must have learnt from the results of the Punjab and Uttarakhand elections, the average Indians existence is becoming more miserable with every passing day. The price of foodgrains is shooting through the roof. Artificial crises are created in the supply of LPG cylinders to encourage black-marketing. The income tax exemption ceiling is still Rs 100,000, which is a drop in the ocean. On top of this, an extra surcharge of 1 per cent has been imposed in the form of education cess. And what can be more ironic than the price of pet food getting cheaper, while one cannot get a kilogram of flour for any less than Rs 18?

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir The finance minister has tried to be socialistic in his approach to the budget this time. Thus he has reduced duty on food for cats and dogs, so that men may change their eating habits and shift to the cheaper options. Tax-cuts on pet-food and paan masala certainly call for champagne-parties in the rich and elite circles. Rich Indian men have an added reason to celebrate now, thanks to Chidambarams proposed tax-cuts on diamonds and semi-precious stone, keeping their wives happy has been made so much easier.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir The Union budget 2007-08 has harped mainly on fiscal consolidation, and on bringing the fiscal deficit down to 3.3 per cent from 3.7 per cent. This is indeed important, given the unprecedented growth India is experiencing at the moment. However, Chidambaram has wasted an opportunity possibly his last one to carry forward the legacy of his 1997 budget and initiate fresh reforms prior to the next general elections. The global equity market meltdown could not have come at a worse time. But it is the go-slow policy on reforms that is primarily responsible for failing to revive the spirits of the bourses.

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Gupta, Bandel

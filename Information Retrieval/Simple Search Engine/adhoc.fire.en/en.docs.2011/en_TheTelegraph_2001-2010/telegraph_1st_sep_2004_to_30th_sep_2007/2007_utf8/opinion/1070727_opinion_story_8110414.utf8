The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SENS SENSE

 Out of the mouth of a sage comes words of common sense. There was a time when Amartya Sen was attacked for propounding theories that were known to everyone, including grandmothers. But there are moments in history when even self-evident truths need to be reiterated by a person of Mr Sens erudition and stature because they help to dispel prejudice made to masquerade as profundity. Mr Sen, in a recent and exclusive interview to this paper, has emphasized the point that industry is always located on heavily fertile land. This pays put to the ideas of those propagandists who have been arguing that Tata Motors could have easily been given land in areas that are less fertile than the land in Singur. Mr Sen also noted that Singurs proximity to Calcutta gives it certain locational advantages. These points are by no means original or unknown. But Mr Sens making them gives them a certain gravitas and credibility.

 Nobody can say that Mr Sen is a blind upholder of the policies of the Left Front. In his interview, he squarely blamed the Left Front, especially the Communist Party of India (Marxist), for aggravating the process of deindustrialization in West Bengal. He acknowledged that Jyoti Basu was aware of this, and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been working to remedy this by trying to build a big industrial base in West Bengal. According to Mr Sen, industrialization is not a matter of choice for the state. If West Bengal is to regain its former glory of being one of the richest regions in the world, industrialization has to happen. The quoted words are Mr Sens. The professor also warned that stopping the use of agricultural land for industries is ultimately self-defeating. In other words, such prohibition would adversely affect the working people of the state peasants and labourers. The warning was clearly directed at political parties opposing the process of industrialization set in motion by Mr Bhattacharjee, and also at certain sections of the Left intelligentsia who have set themselves up as critics of the chief minister.

 In an ambience that is vitiated by irrelevant controversy and not a little violence, Mr Sens arguments come across as the voice of sanity. What he has said needed to be said, and said by him. Some of his intended listeners might be deaf, but common sense has a habit of winning in the end.

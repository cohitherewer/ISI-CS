 CHANGE IS IN THE AIR

 MALVIKA SINGH

 MALA FIDE 

 I often wonder why huge excitement is generated when political players speak the truth. It is strange to hear the voices of a lost generation of politicians screaming murder because Rahul Gandhi referred to the partition of Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh. Was India instrumental in the partition? Didnt India support the call for freedom from west Pakistan? Was Bangladesh liberated? And did the event mark the partition of Pakistan? If the answers to the questions are yes, then all that the oldies can pontificate on are the repercussions of Rahul Gandhis reference to the ongoing process of peace between India and pakistan. However, if the peace process is based on half-truths, then it is bound to fall apart sooner or later. Why is Rahul Gandhis remark causing such agitations in opposing political parties? What is the reason behind the endless coverage in newspapers sans intelligent argument? Maybe generation-next has a different take on past events as well as another way of handling the realities of today. The terms of reference are bound to change, as will the narrative. Those stuck in a time warp will feel threatened as their space shrinks. They will question every statement, and so they should. They will create a ruckus as their comfort levels shake. The contrasts between the two generations will grow sharper as time moves on. This is how the generational shifts always happen. Change is in the air!

 Priorities too will change. Those who see their power base in danger of being taken over will overreact and try to garner support through failed rhetoric and false oratory a way of communication that belongs to the past. The tenor has changed. It is more inclusive now. It tries to draw you in. It is in sharp contrast with the dramatic declamations, interspersed with a long pause here and there, which was the style of the delivery of speeches in older times. I find it interesting to watch the changing scene and recognize that it is in fact beginning its metamorphosis, albeit slowly, but hopefully, steadily. 

 Follow the leader

 The overreaction to anything that is slightly alien to the stagnant narrative of politics, stems from an instinctive understanding that the ground truths are shifting and that, over the next five years, radical changes would be imminent. So, we wave our hands and stretch our vocal chords. Those of us who are over 50 and are using inexperience as an argument against the young, are clearly in a state of denial. This generation is beginning to pass on.

 If we look around us, almost all those in the political arena appear to be comfortable in the failed status quo that they have created and lived off, much like parasites. Politicking, infighting, backbiting, lies and half-truths have been the ingredients in the pudding of Indian democracy, heightened in flavour over the last decade. But there is a glint of light on the otherwise bleak horizon. A majority of people across the country are savouring a heady combination of fresh spices, one that liberates the taste buds of the mind and unchains entrepreneurship from the stranglehold of an exclusive political class propped up by a rusted bureaucracy that has held this country to ransom for much too long.

 Today, the unshackling has begun in the profession of politics, and hopefully, through a process of trial and error, a cleansing will resume that will affect the much required change in the country. The mind, body and soul of our political players need to be put through severe dietary restrictions! High handedness, gunda gardi, threats, bribery and corruption need to be expelled from the body politic. Selflessness and commitment need to be strengthened. The people are changing and politics will have to follow the leader the people of India. That is the real truth of a democracy.

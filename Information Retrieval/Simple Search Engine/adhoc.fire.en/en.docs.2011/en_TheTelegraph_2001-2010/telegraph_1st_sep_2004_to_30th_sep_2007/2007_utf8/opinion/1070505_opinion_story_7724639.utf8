 What age cannot wither

 Nilaksha Gupta

 Music

 Swaramayee organized an evening of music, Amrutprabha, at G.D. Birla Sabhagar on April 28 to felicitate the Kirana Gharana vocalist, Dr Prabha Atrre, on her 75th birth anniversary. Performing in the second half of the programme, the singer proved that age had not affected the crisp and appealing voice she has been known for.

 Atrre did not go in for an elaborate development of raga Bihag in the vilambit khayal she started with. Avoiding the lower pa ni sa segment totally, she opened up the full medial tetrachord in the first 13 minutes and started singing bahalawas from the 18th minute. These were followed by slow vistar with sargams that developed into slow-medium sargam patterns.

 Some of these were used in the brief round of aakar taans that came next. Atrre did not sing the antara. There were mainly duni aakar taans in drut teental khayal. This added up to a fairly pleasing, although not a really laudable, session of khayals in Bihag. She went on to sing a drut ektal khayal in Kalavati, in which the taankari lacked variety towards the end, and a dadra in Bhairavi. The tabla accompanist, Samar Saha, and the harmonium- player, Rupashree Bhattacharya, provided her with good support.

 Senior sarod player, Buddhadev Das Gupta, had opened the evening with an alap in raga Barwa in which the lack of emphasis on the shuddh nishad, and, to a lesser extent, on the gandhar, deprived the raga of its full colour. There was also a noticeable paucity of meends in the quicker-than-usual movement of the alap and of lapets, gamaks and bolkari in the jod. A couple of bol ang passages, however, were heard in the brief round of ladant. Perhaps, as a sort of compensation, the vilambit teental gatkari mainly comprised bolkari, bol ang rhythmic patterns and taan-toda. The gat seemed to be the one played by the late sitar maestro, Vilayat Khan, in one of his LP records.

 Buddhadev Das Gupta went on to play brief dhamar gatkari in Saindhavi, drut teental gatkari in Sindhura and two drut teental compositions in Kafi, and ended with a famous composition of Ustad Mohammed Amir Khan. The tar saptak gandhar was not struck fully in tune at times in the Sindhura drut gatkari in which there were some duni passages, and, finally, jhala. Samar Saha provided good tabla accompaniment and played his own rounds with the usual verve.

 THE END IS 

 IN SIGHT 

 Gwynne Dyer

 FIFTH COLUMN

 Over 

 a thousand years ago, according to ancient English tradition, 

 King Canute set his throne on the shore and ordered the 

 tide to stop rising. Just over a month ago, President Robert 

 Mugabe of Zimbabwe took an equally bold stand, ordering 

 inflation to stop forthwith or else hed send those responsible 

 to jail.

 Canute ended up with the waves 

 sloshing round his knees, but at least he had the satisfaction 

 of teaching his courtiers a lesson on the limits of royal 

 power. Mugabe will end up drowning in the inflation his 

 own policies have created but it will probably come as a 

 great surprise to him, for he doesnt seem to understand 

 that he cant just order it to stop.

 I believe inflation will hit 

 1,500,000 per cent by the end of 2007 if not before, said 

 Christopher Dell, the US ambassador to Zimbabwe, in an interview. 

 By early last month, South Africa was putting together a 

 proposal to stop the hyper-inflation by pegging the Zimbabwean 

 dollar to its own currency, the rand. Its huge foreign currency 

 reserves would enable Zimbabwe to go on importing essential 

 goods, the flow of economic refugees into South Africa would 

 not become a tsunami, and, gradually, the internal situation 

 might stabilize. The price, however, was agreement by Mugabe 

 to key reforms, which would restore democracy in the country.

 But that would ultimately mean 

 surrendering power, something that is inconceivable to the 

 83-year-old autocrat who has ruled Zimbabwe for the past 

 27 years. Indeed, the countrys rapid descent into poverty 

 and chaos only began when Mugabes rule was challenged. 

 For the first two decades after the end of white-minority 

 rule, the Zimbabwean economy grew steadily: children went 

 to school, people ate well, and the future seemed bright. 

 But then, to Mugabes horror, Zimbabweans voted no in 

 a referendum in 2000 that would have given all government 

 and military officials amnesty for crimes committed while 

 in office.

 Getting dark

 He felt threatened, so he came 

 up with a policy that rewarded his closest supporters and 

 kept them loyal. He began confiscating the white-owned farms 

 whose crops earned 80 per cent of the countrys foreign 

 exchange, handing most of them over to his own cronies who 

 had no idea how to run them. Inevitably, the economy went 

 into a decline, so Mugabe started printing money to bridge 

 the gap in state revenues, and inflation took off. The economy 

 has shrunk by half in the past seven years, and by last 

 month the Zimbabwean dollar was trading on the black market 

 at 300,000 to the US dollar.

 Three- and-a-half million of Zimbabwes 

 twelve million people have fled abroad to seek work. The 

 money they send home is the only reason most Zimbabweans 

 eat at all, since unemployment at home is 80 per cent. The 

 average lifespan in the country has halved in fifteen years. 

 But the most urgent problem for Mugabe is that his own security 

 forces cannot feed their families because their huge pay 

 rises still cannot keep up with inflation.

 If the security forces turn against 

 him, he is finished. So early last month, he decreed deep 

 price cuts for all consumer goods and sent the troops out 

 to enforce them. The idea that you cannot simply impose 

 lower prices, he scoffed, is bookish economics. But if 

 it costs more for bakers to make bread than they get for 

 selling it, then they stop baking. 

 A month later, the shelves are 

 bare of staple foods throughout Zimbabwe. Rural people can 

 scrape by somehow, but people in the urban areas are getting 

 desperate. Mugabe has played his last card, and he will 

 probably be gone by the end of the year. The pity is that 

 the prosperous country he built in his first twenty years 

 of power, when he could win the elections more or less honestly, 

 is already gone. It will be hard to bring it back.

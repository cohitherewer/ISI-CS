 DUAL TONE

 Economic reforms, unlike charity, do not begin at home. Many politicians and political parties known to be advocates of economic reforms have suddenly become very strident critics of the West Bengal government because of its policy of acquiring agricultural land for industry. The most surprising has been the statement by the finance minister, Mr P. Chidambaram, who is one of the most vocal proponents of economic reforms. Mr Chidambaram spoke against the snapping of the sacred ties that exist between the land and its tiller. He added that wherever these ties were broken, they would be opposition. The context of these remarks was obviously the violence witnessed in Nandigram in West Bengal. Similarly, Ms Sushma Swarajs heart bled so much for the poor villagers of Nandigram that she visited the affected area to offer sympathy. It is necessary to expose the hypocrisy of these leaders. Mr Chidambarams home state, Tamil Nadu, has made remarkable industrial progress in recent years. This has been possible through the setting up of manufacturing units on land that was previously used for agriculture. Mr Chidambarams conscience did not bother him then. Or does he believe that the ties of farmers with their land in West Bengal are more sacred than those of their counterparts in Tamil Nadu? In states where Ms Swarajs party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is in power Gujarat, for example land has been transferred from peasants to industrial houses. This, in fact, is the basis of Gujarats prosperity and of Mr Narendra Modis success as a chief minister. Neither Ms Swaraj nor her party has ever raised their voices to protest against the process. But when it came to West Bengal, both Ms Swaraj and the president of her party, Mr Rajnath Singh, rushed to show their feelings for the peasants.

 This shameless display of double standards by Mr Chidambaram and the BJP leaders highlights one very important fact: politics in India is not determined by any accepted and consistent principle. Politics is driven by sheer expediency. Politicians are trying to score political points using events in West Bengal. Thus the sympathy for farmers being exhibited by politicians is insincere and opportunistic. It would not be unfair to suggest that some politicians are conspiring to keep West Bengal economically backward.

 HOW TO WAKE THE SLEEPING GIANT

 Is the win in the Nehru Cup a mark of resurgence for Indian football? Probably not, but it could well be used as a stepping stone, writes Jaydeep Basu

 Come together

 In June 2007, when Bob Houghton completed one year as Indias national coach, he made a stunning disclosure in Delhi. We havent progressed at all in the last one year, he said with a tinge of bitterness. It was with sheer desperation that he spoke about Indian footballs appalling structure. Under my coaching, the national team has played only three matches in one year, he pointed out. To everyone here, a match between Mohun Bagan and East Bengal is far more important than a full-fledged international between India and Japan or India and Saudi Arabia. 

 Two months later, on August 29, Indian football witnessed one of its biggest turnarounds when Houghton guided the national team to a dazzling triumph in the Nehru Cup. India beat Syria by a goal in the finals. The conquest was widely described as Indian footballs resurgence and the British coach was hailed as the new messiah. It may be mentioned here, though, that four of the five teams in the competition India, Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh feature in the last page of Fifas ranking. India tops the page at 151, followed by Kyrgyzstan (153), Cambodia (173) and Bangladesh (176). Syria comes in the page before, at No 112.

 This resurgence of Indian football, if one may call it so Houghton termed it a small step forward owes a great deal to the Englishmans astute judgment of the players at his disposal. Houghton had little room to harbour any illusions about his team. In his 30 years as a professional coach, he has tamed enough opposition on the pitch to gain a formidable reputation. But here in India, he had to work tirelessly to evolve a strategy to combat the system that controls the shape of competitive football in the country. 

 Houghton has had six predecessors in the last 25 years. All of them were vanquished by the system. Even the renowned Ciric Milovan had to leave with bitter memories. He struck a great rapport with the players but was helpless against the structural flaws in Indian football. 

 Houghton displayed amazing skills and power to convince the All India Football Federation about the basic requirements for achieving minimum success with the national team. To the envy of the former national coaches, Houghton was able to force the federation to keep the top players in the national camp for two months. He even got the federation to arrange an exposure trip for the national team in Europe. He reportedly handpicked the teams to be invited for the Nehru Cup as well. For the past two months, he worked more like a CEO than the manager of the national team. 

 Houghtons target was to create a feel-good atmosphere that would restore some of the lost self-confidence among players and officials, not to forget the paying spectators. He has tried to make a difference, and left a few hints to those who are responsible for running the game in the country. Can these people spot the hints? And will they make an effort to cash in on the new-found success? Tall promises have been made amidst the revelry at the Ambedkar stadium on August 29, but given the current state of affairs, an actual resurgence is still a distant dream. 

 Indian football missed the bus in the Seventies when most other national federations in Asia were turning professional. This was the time when the powerbase of Asian football shifted from south Asia. Teams like Burma (now Myanmar), Indonesia, Malaysia or India slowly faded away around this time, leaving the stage for countries like the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq and Iran. China emerged a superpower in the Eighties, followed by Japan and South Korea, now considered leaders in Asian football. 

 The Indian football establishment hardly made any effort to keep pace with the changes. Stray successes like the Asian Games bronze in 1970, the Pesta Sukan title in 1971 and the Asian Youth championship victory in 1974 made them keep faith in their own system. It backfired horribly. 

 During the Eighties and Nineties, a few cosmetic changes were applied here and there, but nobody was willing to probe deeper into the problems. There was one solution for all ailments: appointing a foreign coach. 

 The biggest problem, arguably, is the lack of options at the top. Houghton, too, has suffered from it. Since the Youth Development Programme in Indian football is still in its infancy, the national team always has difficulties in looking beyond the bunch of 20-25 players. 

 At the last Asian Games in Doha in December, Houghton did a highly commendable job with a team almost entirely composed of under-23 players. The presence of so many youngsters is deceptive, because the supply line is not strong enough yet to make the national coach hopeful. The lack of a proper junior programme means that suitable replacements for senior players like Bhaichung Bhutia, Mahesh Gawli, Deepak Mondal or Climax Lawrence are few and far between. 

 Indian football bosses have failed to seize the moment, time and again. In 2001, India had a remarkable run in the World Cup qualifiers that included an extraordinary win over UAE, then ranked 66 places higher than India. Sadly, no effort was made by the AIFF then to retain the momentum. The story was repeated next year when India won the LG Cup in Vietnam , their first major international title in 34 years. The coach of that team, Englishman Stephen Constantine, was again hailed as a hero, but little effort was made to sustain the euphoria. Who can say that things will be any different after the Nehru Cup win in 2007?

 One Nehru Cup triumph cannot sculpt the turnaround of Indias fate in world, or even Asian, football. In the world of ruthless professional football, the least that is required is a well-thought-out plan and its sincere execution. The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, has recently been quoted saying that Houghtons biggest contribution has been to take Indian football beyond individuals. Houghton can do that with his bunch of players, but who will do the same with the federation, stuck in its culture of individual-worship for decades. 

 The AIFF, in all its years of existence, has failed to lay down a policy for the selection of the national team. The composition of the team, as also the amenities offered to the players, is entirely dependent on the whims and fancies of a few individuals at the helm of affairs. While most other federations the world over have well-defined policies pertaining to match fees, bonus and other incentives to be paid to the national team, Indian footballers are still dependent on individual contributions. 

 Nothing could illustrate this better than a familiar scene during Indias matches in this Nehru Cup that of the AIFF president, Priyaranjan Das Munshi, watching the game with a bagful of cash kept beside his chair, to be distributed among the players in the event of a victory. The money did not belong to the AIFF. It was raised by Das Munshi in his individual capacity. It was a laudable effort, but not exactly the best way to usher in professionalism in Indian soccer. 

 To give the devil his due, in the last couple of years, the AIFF has taken a few steps to improve the facilities for the national squad and teams playing in the National Football League. The players now stay in good hotels, get the best of training and medical facilities. The same, however, is not offered to those who remain outside this elite zone. 

 Junior players, who need careful nurture, have been the most neglected lot in Indian football. While seniors in the NFL receive a daily allowance of Rs 1,200, teenagers have to make do with a meagre allowance of Rs 170 per day. The AIFF has ambitious plans such as club licensing, permanent venues and introducing professionalism in all aspects of the game. But it has been intelligent enough to give itself four years to fulfil the promises. 

 It would be wrong, however, to blame the AIFF for all that ails Indian football. The major clubs are also a stumbling block. In most countries, clubs and the national associations work together for the development of junior and sub-junior football. In India, clubs are so reluctant to spend their resources on their respective junior teams that the AIFF has not been able to stage the under-19 NFL the last two years. 

 It is imperative to strike a balance between seniors and juniors, professionals and amateurs. In the rush to promote professionalism, amateur football should not be neglected, keeping in mind that 95 per cent of registered footballers in the world are amateurs. The AIFF has to play a guiding role during the transition from amateur to professional game, even if it cannot match the economic might of Japan or Korea. 

 As Houghton pointed out, a small step may have been taken with the Nehru Cup victory. But to call it resurgence would be stretching things too far. It has given Indians an opportunity to take pride in Indian football. The national federation must see to it that the feeling of euphoria is sustained.

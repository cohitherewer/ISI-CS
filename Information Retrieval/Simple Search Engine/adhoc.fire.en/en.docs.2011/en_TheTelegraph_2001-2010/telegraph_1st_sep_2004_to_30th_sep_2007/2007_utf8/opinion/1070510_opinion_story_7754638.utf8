The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SELLERS OF RIBBON, FIGURES OF MAGIC

 I did not think that the slightly pallid-looking turkey was being hawked on the platform of Jadavpur station. But my eyes, and camera, almost missed its chicks, huddled in a net-covered basket. I was at the time rushing from station to station around Calcutta, trying to meet domestic workers who commuted from villages by local trains everyday. After gawping at the turkey, I boarded a cycle-rickshaw for Bagha Jatin station. On the way, we passed a young man driving an empty rickshaw. His legs worked very slowly, almost tenderly, on the pedals, and he glanced smilingly back at the passengers foot-rest, where two tiny turkey chicks had been delicately placed, like an ethereal carving, with a bhaanr of water between them. The turkey lady at the station had had a customer.

 Hawkers wares in trains and on platforms are not always this alluring. But the more ordinary spread of seasonal fruits next to the turkey is often more useful. For domestic workers who fly towards the trains for a ride back home after a breathless round of travel and work, these fruits and vegetables, safety-pins, hair-clips, drawstrings and numerous other everyday things seem to be life-savers. At Dhakuria station, I have watched the women sometimes pick up from the hawkers all they need for that evenings cooking. The journey back may take two hours, or the road from the home station to the village may be too long, or the women may simply be too tired. The wares on the platform equip them for a fresh round of work at home. Sometimes it is they who are starving, having left home at three in the morning and not having had a single employer give them a meal. A toss of a coin and quick grab at the nearest fruit on offer can sustain them on the journey back.

 Undoubtedly, the position of an observer is a comfortable one. But when flattened against a complicated architecture of rods and seat-backs in a compartment on a train to Tribeni instead, I was aware of holding my breath in not only for determined women, heavy-footed men and writhing children, but also for at least twelve hawkers selling a variety of wares. The winking green lights of a toy cellphone were rather attractive and I lusted after sour brown lozenges. Envy overwhelmed me as two moustachioed men and a spacious woman, all in postures more incredible than mine, managed to buy these. 

 I like hawkers best when I am seated in a train and can see out of the window. Then their rhyming assurances of cures for flatulence and headaches, in seemingly extra-terrestrial voices, become the perfect material for a treatise on popular culture or sociology or economics, and the man carrying pens, ribbons, clothes-lines, torches and handkerchiefs becomes a figure of magic.

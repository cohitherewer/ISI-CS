 ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF GLORY

 The golden boy

 Our Alma Mater: Celebrating 

 the 

 Hundredth Anniversary of the Birth of the Theory of Relativity, 

 Edited by A.M. Harun-ar-Rashid, 

 Dhaka Physics Group, $100

 This book collects a variety of articles, including the classic 1905 paper by Albert Einstein on special relativity, Satyendranath Boses revolutionary paper of 1924 on quantum statistics along with its Bengali translation, and an article on the famous Tagore-Einstein dialogue on epistemology. Along with these, there are pieces on how Dhaka University came to be established, the development of physics there, reminiscences on the beautiful Curzon Hall (the building where the physics department is housed), and some recent writings by its alumni on diverse technical subjects such as cosmic strings, collapsing matter and wavelets, as well as popular accounts of Einsteins theories and astrophysics.

 A Bengali translation of Satyen Boses paper on the light-quantum hypothesis is welcome, as it can dispel many misconceptions among common people about the content of this revolutionary paper. Many still believe that Bose made an important correction to Einsteins equations of relativity, which Einstein himself admitted. That it was just not so, but also an outstandingly original and novel contribution to quantum theory of light is hardly known.

 A.M. Harun-ar-Rashids piece on the Tagore-Einstein dialogue is a valuable addition to Bengali scientific literature, although it is not clear why this article has found place in this volume because it has nothing to do with Dhaka University. 

 Ajay Rays article on the Hartog-Satyen Bose letters is historically valuable. It records how Bose came to be appointed by Dhaka University, the difficulties he faced regarding his salary, how he stuck to his principles leading to the formation of the Bose Committee, and eventually, not only were all his demands met by the university, but he was also given a two-year study leave to go to Europe on a loan of Rs 13,800 because of a postcard he had received from Einstein thanking him for his important contribution to the quantum theory of light-quanta. Bose had hit upon this remarkable discovery while going through a period of financial uncertainty and mental strain.

 Other articles of historical value that have found place in the volume are Abdus Salams Nuclear Physics in Pakistan, S.R. Khastgirs Polarization of Ionospherically Propagated Radio Waves, R.C. Majumdars Dhaka Visvavidyalayer Katha, Tagores address at the Dhaka University on The Rule of the Giant and Rathindranath Boses Visvapadartha Vidyavarsha O Vijnanacharya Satyendranath Bose. 

 One learns from other articles how, apart from S. N. Boses outstanding work, important contributions to physics were made in Dhaka by K.S. Krishnan, Kedareshwar Banerjee, S. R. Khastgir, and others. The university had stalwarts like Sir J. C. Ghosh in the chemistry department and R.C. Majumdar in the history department. Later Majumdar became the vice-chancellor of the university. A glorious record indeed.

 Unfortunately, the volume is somewhat marred by the many typographical errors.

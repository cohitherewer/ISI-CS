 A few more steps to heaven 

 Demystifying Kashmir (Pearson, 

 Rs 425) by Navnita Chadha Behera offers a fresh 

 perspective on the Kashmir issue by revaluating the basic 

 assumptions underlying the conflict ravaging the state. 

 The problem over Kashmir has to be seen as more than a territorial 

 dispute between two opposing nations. Behera shows why it 

 is essential to recognize the interests of the diverse ethnic, 

 racial and linguistic groups in the state if there is be 

 a lasting solution to the crisis.

 The last time I saw Tibet (Penguin, 

 Rs 325) by Bimal Dey is about the authors journey 

 to Tibet on foot in 1956, when he was a teenager. In the 

 preface to the original edition, being reprinted here, Dey 

 refuses to call his account a travelogue since his intention 

 was never to visit Tibet in particular. What he wanted 

 the most was to escape from home. Translated from Bengali 

 by Malobika Chaudhuri, the book transports the reader to 

 the breathtaking landscapes of the Himalayas, as he joins 

 the author in his arduous trek at a time when these terrains 

 were more difficult to negotiate than they are at present. 

 Harum-Scarum Saar amp; other 

 stories (Women Unlimited, Rs 150) by Bama 

 has been translated from the Tamil Kisumbukkaran 

 by N. Ravi Shanker. The voice of the marginalized rings 

 out loud and clear in the narratives and that too at many 

 levels. Not only do the ten stories have the suppressed 

 Dalits of Tamil Nadu at their centre, but also in many of 

 them, the women speak. The protagonists subvert the dominant 

 order by their bawdy comments and their peculiar brand of 

 rustic humour. In the eponymous tale, Ponnuthayi has her 

 husband beaten up by the police when he kicks and tortures 

 her. She sets up shop in the town, putting on sale the thali 

 that had lain around her neck for [the] ten years of her 

 married life. 

 Success with Asian Names (Nicholas 

 Brealey, 4.99) by Fiona Swee-Lin Price is said 

 to be A practical guide for business and everyday life. 

 This book is going to be of help to those professionals 

 who have to deal with unfamiliar-sounding Asian names. Now 

 if you hear names like Charoensak and Chokchai, you 

 can be sure that they belong to a Thai male.

 Letters to Editor

 Landed in trouble

 Sir It is unfortunate that the government of West Bengal has failed to learn its lessons from the Singur incident (Naxalite twist with JNU twist Jan 5). In Singur, the governments attempt to take over agricultural land led to public outrage and violence. If the government is confident that the proposed industrialization would bring prosperity to the people, it should be able to convince those who are going to lose their land in the process. Only this can make them surrender their lands voluntarily. However, it is clear that the government had no such plans in place in Nandigram. The villagers there had reasons to believe that their lands could be taken away for a special economic zone and they turned violent to resist such a move on the part of the government. The chief minister cannot expect his grand plans to take shape without the support of the people. Losing the voters goodwill will only shorten his days in power. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir A handful of Naxalites are surely not powerful enough to create trouble in Nandigram all by themselves (CM applies blunder balm, Jan 10). In Singur it was the police, and not the people, who had applied force against the agitating landowners. And, in Nandigram, over-zealous bureaucrats and party strongmen were responsible for the misunderstanding that sparked off the violence. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is now trying to control the damage by saying that the fault lay with his party. However, one cannot really accept the chief ministers explanation. Bhattacharjee had the example of Singur before him. So it was expected that he would tread with caution in Nandigram from the beginning. Bhattacharjee has promised to hold dialogues with every villager, every panchayat samiti and all block-level committees. Had he taken such a step earlier, this unpleasant episode could have been avoided. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir What authority did the Haldia Development Authority, headed by left MP, Lakshman Seth, have to issue the notice identifying the moujas shortlisted for the SEZ? Whatever apology Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee might now put forward, the truth is that it is his party that has allowed men like Seth to prosper by patronizing them. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) might try to distance itself from Seth now, but the fact remains that he cannot have issued this notice without the knowledge of the party.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Vizag

 Sir Bengal is headed for troubled times. Be it Singur or Nandigram, the people who are suffering the most are the poor farmers. The government has made matters worse by taking wrong decisions. At the same time, it needs to be pointed out that the opposition cannot hope to solve the problem by calling bandhs. Politicians must rise above their selfish interests for peace to return in the region.

 Yours faithfully,

Lubna Salim, Calcutta

 Sir Whenever the police or members of the ruling party face public ire, they make it a point to put the blame on outsiders like Naxalites or university students. This peculiar blame game certainly raises some interesting questions. First, how can citizens of India be termed as outsiders in their own country? If the government defines an outsider as someone who does not belong to the village in question, then the policemen on duty there are outsiders as well. Second, why is so much noise being made about students of Jadavpur University and Jawaharlal Nehru University participating in the agitation? Are students expected to stay out of politics, in a democracy? Politics in India has become mired in corruption. It would be a welcome change if students participate in politics to change things for the better. 

 Farmlands are being taken over by the communists to industrialize the state. Most farmers now feel betrayed by the party they have supported for long. The fact that Niranjan Mondal, the secretary of the CPI(M) local committee, had to flee Nandigram bears testimony to the fact that the party is losing its support among villagers. It is only natural that the villagers will now turn to extremist groups like the Naxalites for support. If the CPI(M) does not want to lose further ground, then it should learn to pay attention to the peoples grievances. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir The creation of SEZs seems to be yet another of those half-baked plans that India is famous for. It seems unlikely that the SEZs will create better opportunities of employment since the farmers who will be displaced by these projects do not have the required skills to work in modernized factories. A generous compensation package is also unlikely to solve their difficulties. The farmers will, in all probability, take up begging after exhausting their resources. The government needs to rehabilitate them properly if it wants to avoid the violence in Nandigram. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

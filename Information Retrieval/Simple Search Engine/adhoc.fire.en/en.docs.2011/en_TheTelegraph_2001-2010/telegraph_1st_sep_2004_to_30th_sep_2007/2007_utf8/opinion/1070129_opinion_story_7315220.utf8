 Letters to Editor

 Power play

 Sir Swapan Dasguptas assessment of Indo-British interface (A historic shift, Jan 26) has not come a day too early. Regardless of all the spin-offs of the British empire, the Brits did make cads of themselves as rulers. After they had to leave India, as a result of the inevitable weakening of colonialism, their main intention was to lionize their erstwhile underdogs to save their huckster morality. Otherwise, when a writer like Michael Madhusudan Dutt could not publish a single line of his English writing in Britain, the present intellectual pash with Amitava Ghosh, et al, does not indicate a penchant for excellence but rather a relativized morality. As rulers, their dread of chillies was comic, but their post-colonial taste for pungent Indian cooking is surely a public relations exercise rather than a physiological mutation.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It has been aptly observed in A historic shift that Indias current status in the comity of nations as a nuclear weapons state and a vibrant economy has provided a sort of leverage to highlight the racist attitude of Britons in Celebrity Big Brother. This is further evinced by the fact that Jade Goody, the tormentor of Shilpa Shetty, has expressed her desire to visit India only to apologize to Shettys parents and to Indians in general. But the whole issue of racist attack on Shetty in Big Brother is ridiculous, and undeserving of so much attention. It is known to us, as it should have been to Shetty, that the basic premise of reality TV is a set of unnatural and unreal situations. It thrives on pettiness, conflict and abuse. Certainly, one does not expect anyone to be disciplined and decorous when confined like an animal. Shetty was in the show to make a few quick bucks. Had she been really afflicted by the racist attacks, she would have immediately withdrawn her candidature. To play the victim on such a stage is not merely ridiculous, it is also hypocritical. She has shown good business sense by pre-selling the inside story of Big Brother to a British tabloid for over 100,000. Surely, then, her trauma couldnt have been very serious.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Swapan Dasgupta believes that India is on a roll, and that the wide publicity given to Shilpa Shettys humiliation on the sets of Big Brother and the tremors it created in the corridors of power in Britain are the direct consequences of India spreading its economic clout over Europe and America. It is true that Indians here and abroad have grown bolder as the country has grown economically. They are no longer willing to take racist comments lying down. But this is just one face of the coin. The other may have inspired the working-class loudmouth, Jane Goody, to heap her insolence on the Bollywood starlet. With Rs 87 to a pound, one of the worlds lowest per-capita incomes, regular suicides of hungry farmers, murder of dozens of poor children, the other face of an economically powerful India is very dark. 

 A recent survey of the purchasing power of people in different countries showed that the average Swiss had to work just a day to buy an ipod, while an Indian has to toil for five months to own one. A deeply skewed economic growth and a military that depends heavily on imported weapons and ammunition cannot make India a nation that can hold the awe of developed countries for long.

 Sir Is Swapan Dasgupta too suffering from an inferiority complex? Why does he take such umbrage at the remarks made to Shilpa Shetty by Jade Goody and her friends? None of the comments, though unparliamentary in part, were racial in character, since they never used the address, you Indians. Even if it is accepted, for arguments sake, that the remarks were racial, is it fair to take Jade Goody to represent British society? Dasgupta, too, is guilty of racism, since he has called Goody a polecat. If Greg Chappell had slapped an Indian, it would have been racism, but when an Indian slapped Chappell, it was just an individual act. Indians are in a habit of calling every instance of white rudeness racism.

 Sir Jade Goody may have thrown racist abuses at Shilpa Shetty, but at least, she is trying to make amends by trying to come to India to say sorry. But look at Shilpa Shetty. She is happily making plans of staying on in London post Big Brother. Either she wants to whip up a bigger political storm around the racism issue, or she wishes to curry more favour with Channel 4. If Goodys comments had made Shetty truly upset with the Brits, she would have come back. True, Bollywood thrives on unrealness, but how fake can our stars get?

 Yours faithfully,

Purushottam Shrivastava, Calcutta

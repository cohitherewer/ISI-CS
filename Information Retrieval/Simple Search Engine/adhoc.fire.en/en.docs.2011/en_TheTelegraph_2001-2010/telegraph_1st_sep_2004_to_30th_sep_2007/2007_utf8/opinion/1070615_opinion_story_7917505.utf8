 LIFE IN A 

 CONCRETE JUNGLE 

 BONA FIDE

 Malvika Singh

 I 

 vividly remember, as a child growing up in Delhi, the hot 

 summer winds that smacked you in the face and swept along 

 the streets, entering your shelter through every possible 

 point that allowed it in and leaving behind a fine layer 

 of dust. It was called the loo, and once it had devastated 

 us, relief came in the form of a thundershower. There was 

 never a regular supply of electricity, even in those days, 

 and we would soak a bed sheet in water, wrap ourselves in 

 it and fall asleep on the roof of the house which had been 

 watered down to cool the concrete. Murder and loot were 

 rare and we could sleep outdoors. Trees were abundant in 

 the city, many in full bloom, showing off their vibrant 

 colours, yellow, red and purple, pink, deep mauve and white. 

 Summer had its own special beauty. May and June were months 

 of sheer torture. The city usually emptied out, with families 

 disappearing into the hills.

 Fifty years later, the trees are 

 fewer, electricity virtually non-existent, despite the supposed 

 progress, and April, May, June, July, August and September 

 have become impossible months. The rains are iffy, water 

 scarce, electricity erratic. Tempers naturally run high. 

 Had there been some innovative thinking from town-planners 

 and the various municipalities, as well as on the part of 

 the elected representatives, the people could have combated 

 this horror of contemporary living. 

 Indian traditions knew well how 

 to deal with the intense changes of weather the materials 

 and methods we used to build with, the design of the buildings, 

 havelis with central courtyards, mud floors that 

 would keep cool, narrow lanes, where the facing buildings 

 cast their shadows on the street, creating the much-needed 

 shade. Narrow windows kept out the glare and the heat. Cross 

 ventilation was the key to all constructions. There was 

 some respite during the height of summer. The Mughals and 

 the British understood the need to keep cool and built according 

 to that need.

 Without cohesion

 Modern, metropolitan India has 

 reduced all our inherent strengths to rubble. There is not 

 one modern settlement that can be celebrated. There is nothing 

 built that is of consequence in architectural terms, and 

 when post-1947 India is excavated thousands of years from 

 now, there will be one lesson to learn from the ruins 

 how not to do it! Architects and builders cut corners. They 

 copy styles from colder climes of the Western world that 

 expose their lazy minds and lack of creativity. Commercial 

 criteria rather than the specific needs of the indigenous 

 people or aesthetics guide them. They use reinforced concrete 

 that cannot breathe, sheets of sheer glass that will only 

 radiate heat in the summer and cold in the winter. They 

 lower the height of the ceiling in an effort to squeeze 

 in one more apart- ment to make that extra buck, all of 

 which make living spaces burning hot cases that they then 

 sell at astronomical prices. 

 There is no value whatsoever in 

 the design or construction of these new apartment blocks. 

 Unfortunately, the same substandard aesthetics is being 

 cloned by builders in all our smaller towns. Green areas 

 have not been made mandatory, proportionate to the built 

 area, making for concrete jungles. Soon these highrises, 

 modern colonies, stark, ugly condominiums, will devolve 

 into high value slums without adequate water, electricity 

 and other infrastructure that is essential for civilized 

 life and living.

 Where are the Laurie Bakers and 

 the Revathy Kamaths? Why are they not building the new multi-storied 

 complexes that should not go above 100 feet and four floors? 

 Where are the intelligent men and women who should be laying 

 down sane building norms and regulations? It is time to 

 dispense with the babu, and bring an element of sense, 

 professionalism and coherence into play.

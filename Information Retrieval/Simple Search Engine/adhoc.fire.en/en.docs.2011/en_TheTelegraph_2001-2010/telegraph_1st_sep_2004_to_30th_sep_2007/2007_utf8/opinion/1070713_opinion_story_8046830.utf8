 The pleasure of a vision

He (Shey) (Penguin, Rs 195) by Rabindranath Tagore was conceived as a fantasy for the authors nine-year-old granddaughter, Nandini. For this endless spinning fantastic yarns, Tagore created the figure of Shey, a man constituted entirely of words and with an inexhaustible repertoire of narratives. Though ostensibly intended as a childrens tale, He resonates with caricatures (in the figure of the ganja-addict Patu), social commentary (a misdirected jackal who aspires to be human) and cultural criticism (the New Age poets of the Hoi! Hoi! Polloi Club, dedicated to the cause of tunelessness). This edition has been beautifully translated by Aparna Chaudhuri and comes with an introduction by Sankho Ghosh. It includes the illustrations by Tagore, which accompanied the Bengali original.

 Phosphorus and stone (Penguin, Rs 195) by Susan Visvanathan is an ambitious novel set in a fishing village in South India. It tells the story of a courageous young woman pitted against unforeseen social and political forces. But the novels humanitarian interests go much beyond this. There is a Marxist, an Economic, and even a Christian angle, including an apocryphal reading, from a feminist perspective, of Jesuss resurrection.

PATRIARCHY (Stree, Rs 240) by V. Geetha comes in the Theorizing Feminism series, edited by Maithreyi Krishnaraj. It aspires to be a concise yet comprehensive history of an idea. Beginning with the History of the Term, the other chapters focus on Global Debates, Indian Arguments on Household, Kinship, Caste and the State and Sexuality and Patriarchy. Each section, written lucidly, comes with a useful bibliography.

 The ultimate India quiz book (Penguin, Rs 250) by Derek OBrien is a compilation of 3,000 questions on the 60 years of Independence. The questions are arranged under several themes: Bhasha and Lipi, Handmade Wonders, Hundred Per Cent Literacy, Young Initiatives, Traditional Sports and so on. One will find answers to some intriguing questions here: In the Mizo sport, Kang Shanaba, the kang is an oval object made of lac or lead with a spot of what in the middle? or What name has been given to the six cleaning processes in the Hatha Yoga Pradeepika?

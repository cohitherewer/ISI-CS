The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 KNOWING BEST

 To many, the revelations made by the Central Board of Secondary Education will seem quite unremarkable. The board has publicly declared that it has no system for re-evaluating answer scripts, which are burnt three months after the results are declared. In the existing system, all that can be done by way of a review is checking the total, of course before the papers turn to ashes. This is a perfectly outrageous breach of just practice, and what is equally outrageous is that fee-paying candidates and their guardians, whose lives depend on these results, have been putting up with this gross ineptitude for years. However, both mindsets have been seriously jogged and by none other than the Right to Information Act. The board has been forced to make these facts public because the Central Information Commission wanted to know about the CBSEs re-evaluation system, only to be told that there wasnt any. Every kind of legal, political, academic and popular pressure should be put on the board to rectify this shocking oversight, and the CIC should keep a relentless vigil over the entire process until the board puts its act together.

 It is reassuring to see how the RTI Act is beginning to change attitudes and, in some cases, practices in areas where the notion of transparency was a perfectly alien thing. Public examinations have repeatedly come under the acts scrutiny, and such augustly un-transparent institutions as the Union Public Service Commission and Calcutta University have been forced to mend their ways by allowing their examinees to have a look at their scripts. No modern democracy can afford to let pass these crucial entitlements and obligations. And it is just as important to create a state of awareness in the public regarding the various and wide-ranging applications of the act. West Bengal, it has recently been revealed, is one of the worst offenders against this law, and here too boards and universities are likely to hang on to their ancient and unthinking ways regarding such matters. So public consciousness-raising has to be taken on concertedly, and without depending on the government. Young people, especially students from every section of society, should realize how this act empowers them all to take their future in their own hands and not let it be ruined by institutional or governmental indifference. Asserting their right to know would be the best way to start being democratic citizens.

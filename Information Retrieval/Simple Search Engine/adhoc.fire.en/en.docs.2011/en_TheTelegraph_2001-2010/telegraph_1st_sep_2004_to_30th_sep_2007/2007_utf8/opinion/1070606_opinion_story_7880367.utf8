 BEYOND ENMITY

 It cannot be a good omen for a democracy if the government and the Opposition meet only to squabble. Jyoti Basus initiative to engage Mamata Banerjee in the peace-talks over Nandigram and Singur is a welcome move that might help reduce political conflicts in West Bengal. That the two leaders succeeded in keeping aside their personal dislike of each other for the sake of peace is a rare event for Bengals bickering politicians. But Mr Basus move has its flip side. For all his experiences as a politician, and his long tenure as chief minister of the state, he no longer holds any public office and cannot speak on behalf of the government. The responsibility for the governments actions and moves lies solely with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Well-intentioned though it is, Mr Basus role should not take anything away from that of the chief minister. It is not a question of the importance of any individual; irrespective of who occupies it, the chief ministers office, and its sanctity, must not be sacrificed to political compulsions. Ms Banerjee may have her grievances against Mr Bhattacharjees ways of handling the issues at Singur and Nandigram. Even some partners of the ruling Left Front are unhappy with the chief ministers handling of them. But they cannot make Mr Basu an arbiter over the governments actions or invest him with any provisional powers. 

 What is at stake is of far greater significance than the smiles and the good words exchanged between two old political foes. Unfortunately, both Ms Banerjee and the leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have reduced the larger issue of Bengals industrialization to a game of political one-upmanship. Moves and counter-moves have been planned only with political losses and gains in mind. It is a sad reflection on Bengals political culture that the leaders place the interests of their parties above those of the state. After decades of doubt and even open pessimism, investors are showing an interest in Bengal. The last thing that Bengals politicians should be doing is to act as enemies of that promise. 

 That is not to say, however, that politicians have no role to play in the new economic climate. In fact, their role has never been as important as now. The new opportunities have also posed new problems. If anything, the troubles at Singur and Nandigram show how complex the new challenges can be. That is why the need for engagements between the government and the Opposition has become more important than ever before. But if political parties turn such engagements into turf wars, they would be doing incalculable damage to Bengals economic future. These are also testing times for the states political class. Their actions will show if they are any good at anything other than street fights.

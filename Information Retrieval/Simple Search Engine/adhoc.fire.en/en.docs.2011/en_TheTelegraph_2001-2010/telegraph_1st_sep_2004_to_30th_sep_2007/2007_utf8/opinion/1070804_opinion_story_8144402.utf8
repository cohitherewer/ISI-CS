 PAST GLORIES 

 AND PRESENT GRUDGE 

 THIS ABOVE ALL

 Khushwant Singh

 A culture of equality 

 I have learnt more about Islam 

 and problems facing Muslims in the last 20 years since they 

 have been in confrontation with Western powers than ever 

 before. We need to know more about their religious beliefs 

 and the divisions among them before we can unravel why they 

 react in different ways when issues concerning them crop 

 up in different parts of the world. I keep a handy dictionary 

 by my side to help me out: The A to Z of Islam, by 

 Professor Ludwig W. Adamec. Besides giving a summary of 

 the history of the rise and spread of Islam, it tells you 

 of the Sunni-Shia divide, and later developments; Pan-Islamic 

 movements, Wahabis, Deobandis, Barelvis, Bizbullah, Al Fateh, 

 Al Hamas, Al Qaida, Taliban, Chechens, Kurds, Druzes, drinking, 

 hijab (burqa), polygamy etc. You get a glimpse 

 of the minds of Muslims and why they nurture feelings of 

 being wronged and prefer martyrdom in a jihad (holy 

 war) to life in a world which discriminates against them.

 The rise of Islam as a world religion 

 was as spectacular as its decline. Within a few years of 

 the Prophets death, Muslim armies ran over the whole of 

 the Middle East, swept over northern Africa, conquered Spain 

 and went into the heart of France before they could be halted. 

 They entered Europe from the other end as well and knocked 

 at the gates of Vienna; they captured large territories 

 in eastern Europe and Russia. They also conquered Persia, 

 Afghanistan and northern India. Without having to fire a 

 musket, they converted Malaysia and Indonesia to their faith, 

 which promised brotherly treatment. Western historians have 

 attributed all of this to the sword of Islam. It is only 

 a small part of the story. The truth is that Islamic civilization 

 was superior to its Western counterparts, and what it stood 

 for offered more to the people who embraced Islam than the 

 other religions. Muslims were way ahead of others in arts, 

 literature, sciences, mathematics, astronomy medicine, architecture 

 and the fine arts. They also offered a sense of equality 

 which no other religion did at the time. They shook Europe 

 out of its stupor. While Muslims rested on their laurels, 

 Europeans went ahead to become pioneers in many fields of 

 learning, notably techniques of warfare and soon reduced 

 Muslim nations to subservience. Thats where they are today, 

 and attempts to get out of the morass appear pathetic. They 

 had a great leader in Ataturk Kamal Pasha. With one stroke 

 of his pen, he abolished the Caliphate, forbade the wearing 

 of burqas and polygamy. It is because of him that Turkey 

 is today as advanced as any European country. The Shah of 

 Iran also banned the burqa; he also rightly regarded it 

 as an emblem of jihalat or backwardness; Ayatollah 

 Khomeini brought it back and made it compulsory for women. 

 Religious bigots like the Wahabis, al Qaida, taliban, Deobandis, 

 Barelvis do their best to keep their community backward 

 and get support for it too. Fatwas and calls for 

 jihad and terrorism give Islam a bad name. It is not Israeli 

 or American propaganda; it is tragic reality that Muslims 

 wallow in their past glory, nurture grievances against the 

 Western world, but do little to get back to being world 

 leaders in everything that matters in life. I am reminded 

 of lines by Syed Zameer Jafri:

 Mussalmano kay sar par khwah 

 topee ho na ho, laykin/ Mussalmano kay sar say boo-e-sultanee 

 nahin jaatee (A Muslim may or may not have a cap to 

 cover his head,/ But a Muslim never forgets his royal past, 

 it can be said).

 For better or for verse

 Poetry is unquestionably the highest 

 form of literary expression. You dont have to be very erudite 

 to compose verse because it is based on emotions, not learning. 

 That is why many people try their hands at it while in school 

 or college. Unfortunately it has few takers, and publishers 

 rarely risk their money bringing out works of poetry. Sunday 

 editions of some newspapers use poetry as space fillers; 

 there are also a few magazines devoted to poetry, but with 

 small circulations. A break was made by the late Ravi Dayal 

 when he, as the first general manager of the Oxford University 

 Press, published works of Indian poets. The experiment was 

 successful. Now the Sahitya Akademis Navodaya series has 

 taken up the baton. I have in hand its first collection 

 of poems A Reluctant Survivor, by Sridala Swami, 

 with an introduction by Keki Daruwalla, guru-critic-promoter 

 of English poetry written by Indians. Sridala is a film-magazine 

 editor based in Hyderabad. She also has works of fiction 

 to her credit.

 Sridala Swami writes blank verse 

 but her poems have resonance, rhythm and profound thought 

 content. Daruwalla has quoted some lines to prove it; I 

 quote a short poem which is closer to my ageing bones:

 Age comes, vision goes.

 Hearing, smell, taste all grow dim.

 I have grown accustomed now

 to making up the whole as I go along,

 to guessing what should be there

 because I once knew how it was.

 Certainties exist

 only with the small, the near

 the immediate.

 With these I try,

 sometimes in vain,

 to piece together the world.

 Hullabaloo over H

 I landed at the Los Angeles airport 

 on June 7, 2005 on an Air India flight. I was 82, and though 

 in good shape, I thought my request for a wheelchair would 

 save me carrying my hand-baggage to the immigration desk. 

 My name is Jai Dev Bajaj. I discovered that Mexicans pronounce 

 J as H like San Jose is pronounced San Hosey. A dark and 

 buxom Mexican lady pushed my wheel chair and shouted at 

 the gate: This, Sir, is the wheelchair for Haidev Bahaha!

 To my good luck, a friend of mine 

 from my Lahore Government College days, Jeevan Lal Ahuja, 

 had come to meet me at the airport. He advised me: Dont 

 take the Mexican twisted-tongue pronunciation seriously. 

 They call me Heaven Lal Ahuha.

 GORY TALES OF A PATCH OF GREEN

 Uddalak Mukherjee and Sudeep Paul unearth the details of turf wars on the Maidan which claimed the life of a young cricketer recently

 Hard hitting

 Ab Maidan mein aa ke khelne mein dar lagta hain. With these words, the frail, little boy fell silent. He and his friends were kicking a rubber ball on a patch behind the Mohammedan Sporting ground when we arrived. Seeing us approach, they had stopped playing and busied themselves in gathering up their belongings. They were clearly uncomfortable with our sudden intrusion, their eyes betrayed their nervousness. We asked the boy a few more questions. Was he scared because of what happened to Mohammad Imran the sixteen year old boy who was beaten to death during a brawl over sharing the playground on the Maidan two weeks ago? Are turf battles common on Calcuttas greens? Mohammad Zalaluddin remained silent. But then, someone in the group chose to speak. Shamim (name changed) was wearing an impossibly long trouser, the sides of his face and his bare upper body were splattered with mud. He told us that he has heard stories about older boys fighting for space on the greens with rival groups. Threats are issued, and the players, on some occasions, even come to blows. His mohalla friends had told him about these ugly exchanges. Even as he spoke in a low voice, Shamim continued to look around uneasily. We asked him whether he knew what had happened to Imran. For the first time, Shamim paused before answering. He turned away, stared hard at the distance, and then said that he was Imrans brother.

 The turf-war on the Maidan cannot be divorced from the question of urban development in Calcutta. With open spaces in the city in decline, more and more neighbourhoods are losing their playgrounds. Over the years, the Maidan, too, has been encroached upon. The widening of the Jawaharlal Nehru Road, the holding of fairs and political rallies, and beautification drives that have resulted in the creation of such monstrosities as the Eliot Park have shrunk the Maidan further. Consequently, too many individuals are fighting for control over a receding territory. 

 While strolling across the Maidan in the fading light, we came across Sheikh Soniruddin, a vendor who has been selling cakes and patties on the Maidan for fifteen years. Soniruddin told us that boys come from as far as Phoolbagan to play on these grounds. On Sundays, the Maidan is literally cramped for space, he added. And sometimes, on days like these, boys get into fights over the sharing of space. On April 30, one such brawl turned ugly, and blood was spilled on the greens.

 A second contributor to the turf-war is the fact that there are only a few grounds that remain open for public use. Apart from the Victoria grounds, the stretch adjacent to the Mohammedan Sporting Club and some patches around the race-course, the rest of the space on the Maidan is divided between some seventy-odd clubs. The club grounds are, naturally, out of bounds for non-members. At the most, they get to use the tracts that belong to smaller clubs, but only when the clubs themselves are not using them. This implies that the pressure on the Maidan is not distributed evenly, but is concentrated on a few spots such as the Victoria grounds, where turf-battles are most visible. The grounds near the Eden Gardens are usually trouble-free because of the presence of clubs as well as the police. By contrast, there is little vigilance exercised on the Victoria grounds.

 We caught up with a traffic sergeant near the Eden Gardens. The man, walkie-talkie in hand, was bent over his shining red motorbike, scribbling notes on a writing pad. On hearing our question, he looked up, squinted and put his pen down. Then, in a gruff voice, he said that patrols around the Victoria grounds needed to be increased, before turning away to attend to his cackling wireless. 

 Syed Kamal Haidar and Ashraf Haidar, two members of a group of older boys who were playing cricket on the Victoria grounds, seemed to agree with what the police officer said. The Haidars and their friends have been playing cricket on this ground for years. We are veterans here , quipped one of the players. Perhaps that explains why they have not had to face an untoward incident during their outings. But the boys are not exactly happy with the role of the police either. All that they are interested in is harassing visitors, even for minor offences, said Haidar. Worse, they seldom intervene in the case of a fight.

 But then, the people we spoke to the vendors, players, and even the lone policeman seemed to agree on one point. The trouble-makers, we were told, were mostly Muslim boys who came from poor neighbourhoods such as Hastings, Kidderpore, Ekbalpore and Mominpore. An excitable lot, they were adept at using violence to protect their turf. Mohammed Imran, the boy who was killed, we were reminded on more than one occasion, was a resident of Ekbalpore. Ashraf, who stays on Eliot Road, also claimed that it is difficult to get along with these boys. Hence, he and his friends preferred to keep them at a distance. The sergeant, however, was more blunt in his analysis. Growing up in a household of four members is vastly different from a childhood spent in a house with ten or more members. In the eyes of this law-keeper, the behaviour of the boys from Kidderpore could be explained with the help of such pointers as poverty and its relationship with class and religion.

 After Imrans death, psychologists had expressed concern about the incidents of increased aggression on the cricket field. They also concluded that such violence was a product of impressionable minds trying to emulate the aggression that was on display in international cricket. A game was a matter of life and death, explained an expert, when he was asked about his views on the tragedy. But the people we talked to seemed to discount such a possibility. Although most of them admitted that turf-wars are a reality on the Maidan, Imrans death, they felt, was an aberration. 

 Calcutta, like any other metropolis, will always have its share of poor neighbourhoods. But it is criminal to blame a death on tough boys from poor neighbourhoods when the problem lies elsewhere. As long as the Maidan continues to be encroached upon, pushing more and more people into fighting for their share of space, one cannot discount the possibility of violence, even death. Handing the Victoria turf over to private concerns or clubs for maintenance and vigilance may appear to be a way out. But, this too, would have its share of opposition. 

 Syed and his friends contend that the introduction of private bodies would simply compartmentalize the Maidan further, thereby increasing the possibility of turf wars. Perhaps, the only practical solution is to preserve the existing set-up which will keep the Victoria grounds open to all but increase police patrolling manifold. Provisions should also be made for additional vigilance on Sundays and other holidays when the congestion is at its heaviest. To complement police vigilance, some of the clubs can appoint supervisors to keep a tab on those who come to play on these grounds. Equally important is the role of environmental and civic bodies. These can act as pressure groups to preserve the few remaining playgrounds in Calcuttas neighbourhoods. That would certainly ease the pressure on the Maidan. It could perhaps also reduce the tension and bring an end to the turf-war. 

 But those who frequent the Maidan do not seem to be a hopeful lot. Soniruddin, even as he juggled his crate of snacks, seemed to be resigned to, and almost philosophical about, the problem of encroachment. Erokomi chole asche, he said before walking away towards the Eden Gardens gate. Somehow, that evening, Soniruddins words rang true. Another death on this turf, even an accidental one, appears to be not entirely impossible.

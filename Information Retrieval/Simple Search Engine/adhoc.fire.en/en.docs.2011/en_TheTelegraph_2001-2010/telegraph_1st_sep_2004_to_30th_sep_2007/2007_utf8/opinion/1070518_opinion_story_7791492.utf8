 RAG AND BONE

 If the right people cannot do their job, the courts must do it. This assumption has become so commonplace that even a complaint of ragging can be considered a priority in a courthouse. The Supreme Courts direction that the educational institution in which ragging takes place must report the matter to the police is accompanied by a suggestion to governments that they should consider withdrawing aid to the institutions that fail to check ragging. Institution heads are being made accountable on a number of levels. One, it is implied that they are either unable or unwilling to take firm steps in case of ragging, hence ragging has not stopped. Two, since they have failed so signally in their duty, they would be personally liable if they do not report the matter to the police, that is, let the matter be taken over by the law-enforcing machinery of the State not the most complimentary instruction for the head of a college. And three, the institution might lose government aid if it fails to check ragging. The courts direction, therefore, always comes back to the core point: the right people are not doing their jobs.

 Why is it so difficult to stop ragging? It is true that ragging now is often vicious and violent, unlike the more innocent rite of initiation of older times. In a way, it reflects the intensifying of violence in society. But it also reflects another insidious evil of everyday life: increased politicization. Stronger affiliations with political parties on the part of both teachers and students associations have changed the atmosphere of academic institutions. Extra-academic authorities can dictate equations between teachers and students, thus inflating a question of student discipline into an issue that involves the police and the courts. Neither need be involved if the college authorities take immediate steps, expelling the guilty as soon as the charge of ragging is established. Guardians would not then feel the need to complain to the police or to go to court. The exemplary punishment must be executed by the institution, and not take up the courts time. To have to give priority time to cases of ragging over murders and rapes is a topsy-turvy burden courts should not have to take up. This state of things is a measure of the disorder that is unleashed if the appropriate authorities are incapable of carrying out their duty. It is a pity that the courage to confront students who hurt and damage newcomers is in such short supply in educational institutions.

 TO TALK OR NOT

 The history of modern India and that of Ireland have often run on parallel lines. Both suffered from colonial exploitation and repression, and it was from Ireland that Indian nationalists derived the idea of Home Rule. Both countries have, of course, been torn asunder internally by partition and the resultant sectarian violence. The time has come perhaps for India to learn from Ireland. In Belfast, the seat of decades of violence and terror, Northern Irelands main Protestant party, the Democratic Unionist Party agreed to share power with their principal rival, the Catholic Sinn Fein, from May 8, 2007. Mr Ian Paisley, the Protestant hawk, had in the past always refused to talk to Mr Gerry Adams of the Sinn Fein because of the latters alliance with the Irish Republican Army, the guerrilla group which killed over 3,600 people in the last 30 years. Given this and the history of violence and terror, the fact that the two leaders actually met and agreed on a formula for sharing power is nothing short of historic. What is significant is that both leaders agreed to put the violence of the past behind them. This could well herald a new age of peace and prosperity for Northern Ireland, and for the entire island.

 The lesson for India is that the principal players in Irish politics refused to forsake dialogue despite repeated setbacks. The Good Friday peace agreement of 1998 had not worked out. Paisley had opposed the pact. But the dialogue and the peace process resumed when the IRA pledged to lay down arms and to pursue peacefully its goals of a united Ireland. But what the failed Good Friday agreement achieved was to signal to both the Protestants and the Catholics that the future of Northern Ireland would not be settled on terms set by either of the parties. By failing, the 1998 agreement emphasized to both parties the critical importance of dialogue and the futility of intransigence. Mr Paisley and Mr Adams did not fail to read the signals. The reading of this signal was facilitated by the economic achievements of the Irish Republic. It was clear that Ireland was no longer the poor cousin on the fringes of Europe. Peace promises substantial economic benefits. India cannot afford to ignore the lesson emanating from Ireland. Only dialogue and before that the creation of an atmosphere congenial to dialogue can end sectarian violence and decades of hostility.

 TEST TRICKS

 It is getting easier to link ambitious students (and their parents) in West Bengal with fakery and corruption. But the rot is not confined to Bengal alone. What is beginning to look like a nationwide racket concerning the joint entrance examinations in medicine and engineering is being unravelled in Bengal. Good students in both subjects are being paid thousands of rupees to travel here and sit the entrance tests impersonating registered candidates. There are agents, pretending to run tutorial services, who organize these impersonations, charging each candidate availing himself of these tutorials several lakhs of rupees. Examinees in Bengal have been impersonated by students from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, and the reach of these agencies extends as far as Bangalore. A whole chain of wrongdoers are variously involved in this practice: students, examinees, their parents, middlemen and forgers (of domicile certificates). And there are mysteriously unsuspicious and unobservant board members and invigilators under whose very noses this elaborate wickedness flourishes.

 These are all matters for the police to investigate and punish. But what is the larger picture within which such a system could come into being and sustain itself? It is not enough to put all the blame on the rat race too many people fighting for limited seats. An examination system so absolutely centralized is bound to make itself an easy target for the corrupt and the cunning. If there is just one magic key to the privileged terrain of higher education in the most coveted professions, then it becomes that much more alluring and possible to try to forge that single key. This racket, like the one involving management entrance tests a few years ago, provides another opportunity to question and transform the centralizing mindset in higher education. If different institutions conduct and police their own entrance tests, then the problem of managing an unwieldy system will be minimized. The responsibility of administering the tests as well maintaining standards will immediately become distributed among several authorities rather than a single board, unduly encumbered and empowered. This would automatically weed out most of the undeserving and the unscrupulous. No country deserves wicked doctors and engineers who might justify themselves as victims of an unjust system.

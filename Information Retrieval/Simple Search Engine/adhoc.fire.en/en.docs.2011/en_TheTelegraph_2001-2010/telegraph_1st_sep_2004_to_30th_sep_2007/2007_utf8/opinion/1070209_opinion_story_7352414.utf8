 IN SEARCH OF A LOST CITY

 - Paris from the point of view of the dangerous classes

 By Henri Cartier-Bresson

 Paris, The Secret History By Andrew 

 Hussey, 

 Viking, 

 25

 Despite a dissuasive title, this exploration of the secret history of Paris skilfully avoids the clichd traps of folklore, violence and romance. Andrew Hussey is clearly a card-carrying flneur, at ease with Paris, sympathetic to its people, enthusiastic and curious about the layers beneath the asphalt-covered cobblestones. He is at his best when describing the great poets of the city, Franois Villon, Rimbaud, Baudelaire or Victor Hugo (in whose honour whores worked for free on the day of his funeral). His descriptions give a discerning picture of Paris as an inspiring anthill, where the mundane and the unruly become hallowed. 

 It is true that Parisians, till today, have a reputation for being secretive, wary of authority and suspicious of a foreign gaze. The contemporary eyewitnesses such as the anonymous author of a diary known as the Paris Bourgeois, and Mrs Trollope, whom Hussey draws on, are wonderful sources for giving a lively view of Parisian life. The flow of anecdotes and facts takes us into Paris through the back door. Racing through two millennia of history, we catch glimpses of the plague, the price-tag for rats during a siege (25 cents a piece), torture at the Place de la Grve, slumming in the various cours des Miracles, corpses floating down the Seine and student uprisings (as old and as much an institution as the university itself). 

 It is thanks to its inhabitants ability to overcome the stench, crime and revolts of the city that Paris has been always ahead of its time. But Paris has also led the way because of urban geniuses like Baron Haussmann, whom Hussey describes with a touch of rancour because of the barons destruction of the medieval city, which was reduced to dust by the new avenues. Nostalgia of this kind is a little too sentimental: Haussmanns urban revolution did not just bury a happy-go-lucky lifestyle, but it also dealt with drains and traffic, reeking alleys and the insalubrious quality of life. Paris was thus made into a great model capital. 

 Husseys ambitious and worthy endeavour to tell the history of Paris from the point of view of the dangerous classes whose experiences contradict and oppose official history would have benefited from a rigorous and straightforward explanation of this official history. Husseys contestable, and often gratuitous, analyses of the historical context distract us from his impressive research on Parisian low life. Nicolas Fouquet patron of the arts, brilliant financer and one of the most refined, esteemed and ambitious minds of his time is thus dismissed as a brash and arrogant superintendent of finance, who was imprisoned for life in the Bastille, whereas he actually died in a dark cell in Pignerol, a prison in the Italian Alps. 

 It also seems a little trivial to reduce Louis IX (Saint Louis) to a highly strung asceticfinancing several disastrous and murderous crusades into the Holy Land, which may well have cast him in the present era as a serial killer rather than being appropriate behaviour for the king of France. It was indeed appropriate behaviour for the king of France to conquer land, sacred and profane alike, as the king was also the guardian of the Church. A true historian would have avoided such absurd anachronisms. 

 Husseys passages on famines, wars and sieges are sometimes as confusing as the chaos he portrays. He describes the Resistance barricades during the German occupation as conspicuously absent from the richer neighbourhoods. It is a commonly held, but erroneous, belief that the French Resistance was split along class lines, when, in fact, it cut across social divides, and indeed that was one of its strengths. With the exception of the one on Algeria, the chapters about the second half of the 20th century barely scrape the surface, offering little in-depth analysis of decades still sensitively close (May 68, De Gaulle, Malraux, terrorism, Mitterrand, immigration), and, regrettably, avoid an individual take on todays Paris. The worlds Hussey describes are, for the most part, long gone, and Paris has been toned down to a relatively quiet, expensive and clean European capital. 

 Parisians have lost their belief in the myth of the city, and real-estate prices keep students, artists and the Paris Canaille out of the heart of the labyrinth itself. One enduring parallel, from Lutetia to today, is life on the streets: the cafs on broad and sunny terraces, picnics on bridges, protests pouring into Haussmanns main arteries and homeless people camping out in emergency tents erected above hot-air vents. Hussey concludes with unwarranted optimism that Paris still remains the great laboratory for artists, poets and intellectuals. But in reality, disenchantment and trying to keep afloat are closer to the Parisian mood today. 

 The dangerous classes now live outside the highway belt that encircles Paris, in drab, soulless and pathetic housing estates. As we saw in the autumn of 2005, their angry despair clashes violently with the sheltered and beautiful city hiding within its walls. Given the Parisian taste for revolutions, who knows how brutal the explosion would be if the powder keg were torched?

 THREE POETS

 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES

 Fifty years ago, when I was an aspiring writer, nay poet, at Oxford, my path briefly crossed those of two real poets. Three indeed, if you count a convivial evening at the New College Poetry Society, when the universitys newly arrived professor of poetry, W.H. Auden, no less, was rash enough to bet 5 that none of us could drink a rose bowl of sherry straight off, and I was stupid enough to accept. 

 I won, by the way, even if I did vomit the muck promptly down the nearest plughole, and got my fiver. Next morning the societys secretary suggested I should give it back; it was hardly gentlemanly to send ones invited guest home minus what was in those days a serious sum of money. Oh no? Five pounds was a sight more serious to me than it could be to Auden; and if you make a bet and lose it, you pay up, as Auden promptly had. I kept the money.

 But back with the two poets. One was Dom Moraes. In the Oxford of the Fifties, aspiring poets were ten a penny. Some were talented; most tried hard; some were fakes. Moraes, to my eyes, was a genius; a master of his craft, even no, especially at that age. It was thanks to him that I first set eyes on my other hero, Allen Ginsberg. I had met his work in 1957, at the City Lights bookshop in San Francisco, where I borrowed a copy of his masterpiece, Howl. It had just been published, and banned. It knocked me down, a cry of anguish and rage from a world that I had not even imagined.

 Moraes later invited Ginsberg and his then sidekick, Gregory Corso, to Oxford. Ginsberg went down well. Corso, in after years, became a poet; at the time he struck most of us as a self-absorbed show-off. Hence my own first and last intrusion into literary history. At some gathering, he read his poem, Bomb, a tolerable minor piece, but it struck us, young haters of nuclear weapons, as a hymn of praise to them.

 Any biography of either American will tell you the result: an enraged mob, led by myself, pelted Corso with shoes. Really? Id be happy enough if it were true. In fact, it is pure fiction. Corso was jeered; shoed he was not. Yet it is in Ved Mehtas autobiography, too, and he was in the room. How come? 

 My guess is: Dom Moraes. Mehta was blind. Youd think even a blind man could tell whether shoes were being hurled. But the fact is, throwing ones shoes to show disapproval is not a British habit. In contrast, throwing ones chappals is a familiar Indian turn of speech, if not habit. Mehta was a good friend of Dom; Dom, however Goan and anglicized, was Indian and a superb and habitual fabulist. 

 I met Ginsberg again when I worked for The Indian Express in Bombay. To be exact, he was upside-down; at least, trying to be so, while beside him Pupul Jayakar, a future biographer of Indira Gandhi, was demonstrating that anyone can stand on her head if she knows how. Ginsberg didnt.

 One of my duties at the Express was the books section of its Sunday Standard. We printed half a page of Ginsbergs poems. To go with them, he offered some photos he or his companions had taken: a severed hand by a railway track, or himself naked washing with a lota. Either, he thought, would do to shock the bourgeois. I had to tell him that Indias press might never show a kiss, but would (and did) happily show a man who had just cut off his childs head offering it on a thali to Nehru; or the Rajasthan police with their bag of dead dacoits laid out before them. As for a naked man in a photo, one had only to go to the Gateway of India, and one would find a real one, albeit ash-covered. Indian ways and taboos, I told him, were not Western ones. We settled for Ginsberg and his lota, albeit retouched.

 The last I saw of him was, as he movingly recited, on a Bombay rooftop, a poem entitled Kaddish the Jewish prayers for the dead for his mother. There was a poet. To think that in his later years he was once to be seen pictured in a well-cut suit in an advertisement for a noted firm of American tailors.

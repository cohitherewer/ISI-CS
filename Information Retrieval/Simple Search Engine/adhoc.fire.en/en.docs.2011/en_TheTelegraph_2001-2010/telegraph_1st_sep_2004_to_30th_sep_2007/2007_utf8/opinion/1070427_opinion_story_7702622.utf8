 Those days in the sun 

 CRICKET: THE GOLDEN AGE (Cassell, 30) by Duncan Steer takes the modern cricket-follower to the time when the game was more about characters and less about statistics. As Graham Gooch points out, there are no antics today in the final session of a dying test. But not so long ago, after a nail-biting day in the field (bottom middle), cricketers would slip into fancy dress and let their hair down (bottom left Geoff Boycott as Ranji, and Ian Botham as Boycott). And ladies would puff their faces before going in to bat (top middle). In this largely anglocentric universe, a sari-clad Sharmila Tagore (spelt Shamile here) in 1967, the fiance of the Nawab of Pataudi Jr. comes as a pleasant surprise (right). But the truly unforgettable photograph is that of the fearsome Harold Larwood (top left) delivering cola in Sydney, 23 years after last appearing for England.

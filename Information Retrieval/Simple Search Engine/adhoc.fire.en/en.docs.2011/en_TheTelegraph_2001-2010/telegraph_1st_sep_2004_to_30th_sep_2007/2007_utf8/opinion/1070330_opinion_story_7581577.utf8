The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THINK AGAIN

 The Supreme Court, quite obviously, sees the issue of social justice from a wider perspective than the government in power. After having repeatedly voiced its concerns about the impracticality of using a 75-year-old document as the basis of a policy initiative, the apex court has stayed the implementation of the Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admission) Act, 2006. The interim arrangement will be of immense inconvenience to a state like Uttar Pradesh, whose substantial vote-bank of other backward classes could have swayed the assembly poll verdict favourably for some of the contesting parties. They have pursued the case for reservations for the OBCs most doggedly. The court order, in fact, takes the wind out of their sails by substituting political expediency with genuine social concern as the plinth for social justice. The apex court does this, not by questioning the policy of reservations or by negating the States right to affirmative action, but by egging the State on towards a more realistic appraisal of the situation. It categorically mentions that the law for OBC reservations cannot be implemented unless and until the government is able to determine which sections of the population truly need the benefits of the policy of positive discrimination. Contrary to the governments assumption, the judiciary does not seek another caste-based survey by insisting on a re-evaluation of the statistics. It wants backwardness to be determined as much by the economic as by the social indices. In fact, the courts emphasis on the consideration of economic factors is borne out by its insistence on the exclusion of the creamy layers of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes from reservations. The same policy of exclusion might be extended to the OBCs later.

 The postponement of the legislation gives the State an opportunity to think through the policy more clear-headedly. Apart from the legal hurdles that the government has to cross, there are insurmountable logistical problems that need to be overcome. To match the sudden increase in the number of students entering institutions of higher education with sustained excellence, and to do this without promoting disparities, could be a more difficult job than pushing through the legislation. The judiciary has a lot of doubts about the States preparedness in taking on the challenge.

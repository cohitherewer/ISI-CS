 BLACKED OUT IN BANGLA

 - The cricket fan is cheated by Doordarshans double standards

 I was in Bangalore around the the time the first Test between India and Bangladesh was being played and the only channel I could watch the match telecast live had commentary in Tamil. I like to think that Im an old-fashioned fan, committed to Test cricket, but I couldnt watch Test cricket in Tamil for more than fifteen minutes. I tried turning the sound off but that was even worse. Mute meant no crowd noise and no cricket sounds: no appeals, no edges, no satisfying thhunk when the ball hit the middle of the bat. Cricket as a dumbshow is infuriating; it feels like pantomime bloodless and perverse. 

 At the time I felt sorry for my hosts but not especially worried because I assumed that this was a provincial problem. Once I got home to Delhi, a proper metropolis, the capital of this great republic, normal service would be restored. Except it wasnt, because the dispute between Neo Sports and Doordarshan on the one hand and Neo Sports and cable and satellite operators on the other made sure that the only Indians watching were the Tamil-speaking audiences of Raj TV. 

 How has it come to this? How can there be a Test series being played that features the Indian team with no television coverage and no radio commentary? You might say that a contest with Bangladesh is unlikely to make pulses race, but youd be wrong. Bangladesh helped boot India out of the World Cup, they nearly got the better of a Test match against a full-strength Australian touring side recently, so theyre worthy opponents. I think theres a substantial audience for Indo-Bangla Test cricket; not as large as the audience for one-day cricket, of course, but large enough. 

 Whats happening here is that Doordarshan isnt willing to settle for the modest profits that a low-profile Test series with Bangladesh might have brought in. It telecast the one-day matches because the advertisement revenues are higher for those, but refused to agree terms with Nimbus (which has bought the television rights from the Bangladesh board) for the Test series. Amazingly, Doordarshan was telecasting the one-day series being played between Sri Lanka and Pakistan at the same time as it was conspicuously not doing live coverage of the Indian Test match. This wouldnt be amazing if Doordarshan was a private television station. ESPN/Star Sports as private channels are responsible to their shareholders. If they find that theres more money to be made telecasting ODIs played between Sri Lanka and Pakistan than Test matches featuring India, thats their business. 

 But Doordarshan, as it never tires of telling us when it suits its purpose, is the national carrier. Its paid for by the tax-payers money. Its happy to use its special relationship with the state to strong-arm other television channels into sharing the cricket that it wants to telecast. When the Board of Control for Cricket in India sells the rights to international matches played in India, it makes it clear to the purchaser that the live feed and the revenues accruing from the telecast will have to be shared with Doordarshan. So private broadcasters pay vast sums of money for television rights, and when Doordarshan thinks theres enough money to be made, it piggybacks on them to get its snout into the trough. 

 Now I happen to think that the fans urge to watch cricket matches live and for free doesnt amount to a fundamental right. Im devoted to cricket and I think anything that helps reach the game to Indian fans is a good thing, but that doesnt mean that free-to-air telecasts of live cricket on state television should be mandatory. Cricket for its audiences is a form of entertainment: covering it doesnt qualify as public-service broadcasting. Theres no large public good being served here: telecast cricket is a commodity and theres no reason for the State to intervene to make sure that its available for free. If Doordarshan wants to subsidize its consumption by the general public, it should be willing to buy the rights or pay top dollar for sharing the feed. 

 But Doordarshan, supported by the Indian State, argues that telecasting international cricket featuring India is a form of public service broadcasting. The only justification for its claim that it has a mandatory right to share live pictures is its invocation of the Indian poor who love the game but cant afford to watch it on cable. Given the fact that more and more people receive Doordarshan not directly through their aerials but via cable, this isnt, even on its own terms, a watertight argument. But let us, for the sake of argument, allow that Doordarshan has a legitimate case, that DD National is a unique vehicle for carrying the exploits of the Indian cricket team to the plebeian fan. In which case, how is this purpose served by covering Sri Lankas matches with Pakistan when India is playing Bangladesh? 

 If the public good, defined as the Indian fans right to watch his heroes play, trumps private profit when it comes to the World Cup or a Test series between India and Australia played in India, how come this logic doesnt apply to the India-Bangladesh series? By Doordarshans own logic, its willingness to telecast ODIs featuring two foreign nations while ignoring Indias champions as they labour in the heat of Chittagong, besides being inconsistent, amounts to a kind of treachery. If DDs invocation of the straitened Indian fan helps it muscle its way into vast revenues, surely it should use those revenues to subsidize the telecast of series that might be less profitable. If it doesnt (as it hasnt with the Bangladesh series), it should forfeit its right to share telecast rights to matches featuring India that have been bought at a huge cost by others. 

 Doordarshans greed and callousness apart, the blackout of the Bangladesh Tests is a symptom not so much of Test crickets decline in the subcontinent as the BCCIs deliberate orphaning of Test cricket. The boards greed for ODI revenues has led to the overloading of the Indian teams calendar with stand-alone ODI contests. This has gone hand-in-hand with the boards unwillingness to build a cricket season around a major Test series (as the Australian board has done with its end-of-year Test matches), its failure to make tickets for Test matches available in advance and the failure of provincial boards to build decent facilities in their stadiums. Stadiums like Chepauk and Mohali that have attended to these things have large Test match attendances. Television revenues from ODIs have so debauched the BCCI and its affiliated boards that they have no interest in the hard work necessary to keep Test cricket viable and popular in the modern media marketplace. Despite the amount of Test cricket played the world over, between the BCCI and Doordarshan, it wont be long before live Test cricket on Indian TV becomes an occasional treat, not a constant pleasure.

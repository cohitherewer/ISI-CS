 FROM THE AUTHORS POCKET

 Bookwise 

 Pulp as the future? 

 Two basic facts determine the nature of Indian publishing. First, only two titles out of ten are successful, that is, the edition is sold out within a year of publication and gets reprinted. Ideally, titles should be periodically reprinted and become part of the backlist. It is the backlist where the money is because there are no fixed plant costs. The remaining eight titles just break even, which means they recover the costs of production and overhead expenses. But that is not enough to provide the surplus for further investment in new titles. 

 Secondly, the notion that publishers should improve public taste and knowledge has been discarded as too antiquated and absurd in the past decade. Success is what matters, and success means profit. 

 But how do some publishers, especially the university presses, support publications that do not have a chance in the market place? The answer is cross-subsidizing, that is, 20 per cent of the successful titles should help finance the rest of the list. 

 But how long can cross-subsidizing last? Most university presses are cash-strapped and will soon cut back on specialized scholarly books that have a small market. This is already happening and cuts are bound to increase as the funds continue to dry up. 

 Yet, this does not mean the end to scholarly monographs. Alternatives are being explored and finances are being sought outside the house, rather than inside, as was the practice some decades ago. It is the author who is expected to provide the money required for publication. Part of his research grants can be diverted to publishing along with some of his own resources. Or some organization may be approached to support the publication. 

 Publishers know that authors anxious to progress in their careers will go to any length to have a published work to their credit. They will approach individuals and institutions for monetary support. As long as the money is there, publishers will go along and publish the book.

 Whether one likes it or not, subsidies are necessary for the publication of works that have a small market. Most publishers no longer have the resources to support slow- moving titles; authors must arrange for the resources if they want to be published. 

 This situation has an upside and a downside. Some very good scholarship can be rescued from obscurity and made available to readers. However, given Indian societys materialistic notion of success as something measured by sales, awards and fame, a lot of shoddy work will get published simply because of the availability of money to print copies. Hence, to sum up, subsidies are necessary but they are not always for the good of the common reader.

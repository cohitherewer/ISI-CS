 AFTER CRICKET

 - Why is Arsenal more compelling than Team India?

 Yesterday, my son, who is fifteen, said: Last year we had a great team. I was about to set him right, to say that it was nearly three years ago, in 2004, that we had had something approaching a great team when Gangulys Goers had nearly beaten Waughs Invincibles in Oz, when he resumed his sentence: then Bergkamp and Viera left. I felt a goose walk over Indian crickets grave.

 Most of my sons classmates find greater pleasure in watching Thierry Henry, a Frenchman who captains a London club, Arsenal, than in watching Rahul Dravid turn out for India. The boys in his class who arent fixated on Arsenal are obsessed with Manchester United and someone called Rooney who looks worryingly like an Eighties model skinhead. I could be wrong, my sample could be too small, but I think were seeing a shift in the sporting culture of metropolitan Indian schoolboys of a particular class. Theyre seceding from international cricket and offering their enthusiasm and loyalty to English league football.

 Before you go off thinking that my sons school is some deracinated, air-conditioned NRI heaven, let me assure you that its not. Sardar Patel Vidyalaya is an austere, emphatically desi school, with a great cricket tradition. It has produced Indian internationals (Ajay Jadeja, Murali Karthik) and it has one of the most powerful cricket teams amongst Delhis schools. Lots of sensible kids in the school aspire to play competitive cricket. So far, so good. But ask any parent with a boy in middle-school and hell tell you the same thing: crickets reasonably popular, but it isnt cool.

 No, watching Arsenal play Chelsea with your friends is cool. Watching Arsenal play Chelsea wearing the red, obscenely priced Arsenal jersey, is cooler. To fold yourself into Arsenals global fan base with a casual we is coolest of all, because thats the very acme of cosmopolitan belonging.

 That we wouldnt have been possible till a few years ago, before Star/ESPN began telecasting fixtures live. Recorded matches can seem second-hand because others have watched or used them already. With live telecasts beamed in by satellite, a schoolboy in Delhi can own the action of the match, its suspense, its exhilaration, its heartbreak, in the same way as someone in South Harrow can, because both of them see it happen in real time. Paradoxically, supporting league football is easy because it doesnt involve treason. Its not England youre supporting at football where once you supported India at cricket. No, in cheering for Arsenal, youre supporting a club-side whose captain is French, and whose players are as likely to come from Cote dIvoire as Camden Town.

 And why is Arsenal more compelling than India? Two reasons. One, the Indian team isnt successful enough at cricket to be glamorous. The last ten years of Australian dominance have left the other cricketing nations looking like pygmies squabbling for second place. Two, with the decline of the West Indies and the less-than-competitive presence of Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, international cricket sometimes seems like a small, tawdry, colonial sport, too small and tarnished a mirror to reflect the growing self-consequence of contemporary Indias globalizing elite.

 Crickets current monopoly of the airwaves is owed to two things. One, its historical popularity in the sub-continent, and two, the fact that it was in better shape than its rival, hockey, when commercial television came calling in the early Nineties. Kapils Indians had won the cricket World Cup less than ten years before the sports channels began operating and Indian cricket had in Kapil Dev, Azharuddin and above all, in Tendulkar, champions who could be used to sell anything. Unfortunately for hockey, the introduction of cable television occurred at a time of secular decline, a decline that never plateaued out. Dhanraj Pillay, Indian hockeys most famous player in the recent past, was a few miles short of being a household name.

 Ironically, in the light of the English premier leagues subsequent popularity, Indias domestic football leagues had so little purchase on televisions pan-Indian audience that the sports channels never showed local football on prime-time. Despite the eventful histories of clubs like Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, Leaders Club or Dempo, Arsenals ardent young Indian fans wouldnt know Chuni Goswami from a hole in the ground. This is partly because the standard of football in India is so conspicuously awful compared to televisions non-stop diet of European League games that no one not born into, say, Mohun Bagans fan base, would voluntarily join it and learn its lore and partly because the babalog in Indias English-medium schools think of Indian football as a chi-chi game, a lower-class sport manned by plebeian players.

 The fact that football in Europe has traditionally been a working-class sport, that Zinedine Zidane represents an immigrant working class for whom soccer represents a way out of Frances urban slums, makes no difference to middle-class Indian schoolboys who watch their stars on television screens without social context or history. The extraordinary celebration of Bhaichung Bhutia, an Indian footballer who was recruited to play for a third division English club, is a forewarning of the enormous enthusiasm thats likely to be stirred up if one or two Indian players manage to make their way into the upper reaches of European football.

 I tell myself that even if my sons class is representative of Indias great cities, it represents a numerically insignificant demographic. As television-aided cricket reaches more deeply and widely into Indian society, as talent begins to be produced in provincial places (think of Virender Sehwag, Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel, and Mohammad Kaif), metropolitan towns like Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai become less important as nurseries of talent, and middle-class, urban, English-flaunting children become an insignificant sliver of Indian crickets enormous installed fan base.

 But Im not consoled. Our cricketing genes need to reproduce themselves. When our children defect, an unbroken sequence of cricketing generations is severed, a familial cricketing tradition, a silsila, becomes defunct. Less sentimentally, no Indian game can afford to lose the children of the haute salariat, the class of people who buy fridges and washing machines. Once upon a time, Test cricket was one of the white goods that this class consumed reflexively: but for how much longer?

 In a fix

 Sir The fact that the Nagpur police are suspecting the West Indian cricketer, Marlon Samuels, of exchanging match-related information with a well-known bookie has come as a shock (Rs 500 crores off 100 overs, Feb 12). This incident has, once again, brought the focus back on match-fixing. Although the International Cricket Council has constituted a separate body to prevent the fixing of cricket matches, it has failed to free the game of this menace completely. Cricket boards should be aware that bookies always try and extract important information by befriending players. Therefore, cricket administrators should make it a point to regulate the access cricketers have to such men. Perhaps, a strict enforcement of rules would ensure that the bookies are kept away from the players when they are on tour.

 Yours faithfully,

 Barun Kumar Mahapatro, 

Berhampur, Orissa

 Sir Modern-day cricket has become riddled with match-fixing controversies. This is disappointing, to say the least. If the allegations against Marlon Samuels are proven to be true, it would be yet another instance of a cricketer indulging in corrupt practices. The Board of Control for Cricket in India and the ICC must jointly investigate the scandal featuring Samuels, since it involves an Indian bookie and has taken place in India. Further, the Indian team should be kept under surveillance to ensure that our players are not lured into fixing matches by the huge sums that are on offer. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta,

 Sir We may never know the truth behind the match-fixing allegations against Marlon Samuels. The allegations have become even more confusing following the polices admission that the recorded conversation between Samuels and the bookie, Mukesh Kochchar, carries no evidence of financial deals or commitments. The cricketers mother has reportedly stated that her son has known Kochchar for the last six years. This may well be true, but such an admission can hardly be interpreted as clinching evidence of Samuels having passed on information to Kochchar. The ICC should investigate this incident carefully, seeking cooperation from the West Indies Cricket Board whenever needed, to clear the match-fixing allegation against a promising all-rounder. The Indian government should also strengthen the drive against bookies who have given India a bad name. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir With the World Cup in the West Indies just a few days away, the controversy surrounding Marlon Samuels may hamper the preparations of the West Indian side for this prestigious tournament. The West Indies Cricket Board must exercise extreme caution while handling this affair. The BCCI will also do well to adopt a similar approach, as the name of a former Indian player, Robin Singh, has also been dragged into the controversy. But first, the board should ask the police to make it clear whether it was Singhs name they heard. Could it have been Robinson? Such a clarification should not only give this case a direction, but also clear Singhs name from the allegations.

 Yours faithfully,

 No ticket to ride

 Sir It seems that the members of Lalu Prasads extended family have a penchant for breaking rules (Lalu is in-laws ticket to train ride, Feb 14). Lalu Prasads brother-in-law is never far away from controversy. The railways minister and his wife, Rabri Devi, have also been accused of numerous misdeeds. This time, it was the turn of Rabri Devis parents to travel without tickets. It is really shameful that the railway officials allowed them to continue their journey even after the couple admitted that they were travelling without tickets. If an ordinary man had been found in similar circumstances, he would have never been treated with the same courtesy.

 Yours faithfully,

Arunima Mishra,

 Sir Lalu Prasad should not be blamed for a fault that was committed by his parents-in-law. In fact, one should not criticize his in-laws too harshly either. This was nothing but a case of ignorance on the part of two elderly people. Perhaps Lalu Prasads in-laws thought that they were entitled to free travel, as they were related to the railways minister. After all, it is not uncommon to find family members of politicians expecting preferential treatment. Sometimes, this has led to the unfolding of tragedies. Only last year, Pramod Mahajan was shot dead by his brother because he was denied certain favours that he was expecting from the BJP leader. Going by the culture of nepotism prevailing in India, there are much bigger issues that need to be addressed. Harassing two elderly people is not fair. 

 Yours faithfully,

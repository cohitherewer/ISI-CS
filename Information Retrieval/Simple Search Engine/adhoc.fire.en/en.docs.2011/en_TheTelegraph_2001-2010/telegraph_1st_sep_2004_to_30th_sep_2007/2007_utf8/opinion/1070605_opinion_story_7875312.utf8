 ACT WITH CAUTION

 The use of force is not the best way for a state to win the peoples confidence. If large sections of the people of Manipur are unhappy about yet another extension of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, they have good reasons to feel that way. Even the governments in New Delhi and Imphal know that it is an unpopular measure. The act has been in force in the state and in Nagaland for as long as most people can remember. It would be untrue to say that the act has served no purpose. It has helped the administration tackle the many ethnic mutinies that threaten the states peace and stability. But the act itself has also become something of a threat. The extraordinary powers that it gives the army negate almost all civic liberties. The result is a situation in which the common people suffer more than the insurgents because of the act. It is not just a question of some jawans committing excesses during anti-insurgency operations. Far worse is the constant threat it poses to the lives of the common people. While extending the act in the state for another six months, the chief minister, Okram Ibobi Singh, must have thought of the good uses of the act in maintaining law and order. It is not clear if he had also considered its abuses. 

 However, the real responsibility for repealing the act lies with New Delhi. During his last visit to the state, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, promised to review the governments position on the act. He kept part of his promise by setting up a committee to look into the issue. But a year after the Justice Jeevan Reddy Committee submitted its recommendations to the Centre, nothing has changed. The people of Manipur simply do not know what the recommendations are. If the Centre has its reasons for not withdrawing the act immediately, it has made no attempt at explaining them to the people. This is no way to win the hearts and minds of the Manipuris, as the prime minister hoped to do. At the same time, the non-government organizations which have criticized the extension of the act would be unfair to the army if they fail to acknowledge its role in combating the insurgents. Manipurs wish to live without the fear of the armys excesses is unexceptionable. But it would be a worse disaster if the repeal of the act leads to the rebels running riot again. The best course seems to be to use the act with caution and sensitivity, while it is in force.

 Played like a champion

 After hard work, its time to play

Sir Australia have not only made a hat-trick of World Cup victories, but they have also done it in great style. It may be purely coincidental, but Australians will perhaps acknowledge the contribution of the Indian subcontinent to their victories: in 1999 they beat Pakistan by 8 wickets, in 2003, India by 125 runs, and in 2007, they decimated Sri Lanka by 53 runs. Before this World Cup began, Australia lost a string of one-dayers to England, New Zealand and others, while a few of their star players retired from one-day and test cricket. Only a professional team like Australia could put these things in the past and go on to win the World Cup. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir Glenn McGraths decision to retire from cricket is an example of how to exit gracefully from the game. With Australia winning the World Cup for a record fourth time, McGrath could not have found a better platform to announce his retirement. Indian cricketers should learn the art of saying goodbye from him. This is also a moment when we should pause and think of his genius which made him successful in an era when pitches all across the world have virtually been transformed into bowlers nightmares. Fortunately, the Australians have a bench strength which will help them fill the void left by McGrath.

 Yours faithfully,

Arnab Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir Australia have shown why teams fear to be up against them in final matches of tournaments. No word of praise is enough for the Aussies. Will the Indians learn from the champions?

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Jha, Bangalore

 Sir Clinical is the word to describe the Australian teams performance in the World Cup finals. Coming into this World Cup with a five-match losing streak on their back, the Aussies lifted their game admirably and proved yet again that they can never be written off. 

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampore, Orissa

 Sir The inevitable has happened; the Australians have won the World Cup 2007, and for the third time in a row, after 28 undefeated matches in the World Cup since May 27, 1999. The phenomenal power of the team was on display from the first match they played in the tournament. And they went on to become stronger and more ruthless as the tournament advanced. It has been confirmed once more that there is a considerable gap between the Aussies and the next best team. Those who have some idea of Australian cricket will know that a pool of skilled and fit cricketers are created by Cricket Australia through a systematic process of talent identification, training and exposure. Every Australian cricketer on the field wears on his sleeve the pride to play for his country. Unlike in India, regional interest, favouritism and such ills do not come in the way of 11 players performing as a single, cohesive unit. Only the best get a chance to play for the country. Our cricket administrators have much to learn from the Aussie system. 

 Here are a few suggestions to improve Indian cricket, along the Australian line. First, talent must be identified early, preferably at the school level. Facilities, including scholarships for the poorer students, should be provided by the government and the cricket board. A pool of at least 200 boys must be identified and trained, and the most promising dozen sent to the Australian Cricket Academy every year to hone their talent further. Of course, it goes without saying that the domestic tournaments have to be made more competitive and performance in them the most important criterion for selection to the national team. Finally, sporting wickets of international standard must be available all over the country so that Team India does not bite the dust abroad after winning a series at home.

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir The end of the World Cup spells doom for most coaches. Look at how many coaches are being changed. And so many captains too! With so many greats retiring, one can only hope that the next World Cup will witness a higher level of competition. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir The victory of Australia in the 2007 edition of the cricket World Cup is a victory of professionalism, grit and determination. Amidst bizarre twists, murders and tragedies, the wonderful cricket played by the Australians provided a few moments of joy and satisfaction to cricket-lovers across the globe.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K.Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir By winning the World Cup, and that too utterly convincingly, the Australian team has proved that age is not a factor in determining a teams success. Only fitness and skill count.

 Yours faithfully,

Sarbajit Halder, Calcutta

 The United States of America wants 

 India to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Developed countries 

 are and will remain the worlds major polluters. The US 

 accounts for 24 per cent of global carbon emissions, China 

 24 per cent, Russia 6 per cent, Japan 5 per cent, while 

 India is only 5 per cent. India and China must use less 

 coal to produce energy. If economic growth is not to suffer, 

 they must find other ways to cut carbon emissions. Our self-interest 

 requires it to improve the health of our population. Beijings 

 polluted black skies are a warning to us. But our low per 

 capita energy consumption levels (in 2003, 512.4 kg per 

 person in India, 1138.3 in China, 1674.4 for the world as 

 a whole, versus 7794.8 in the US), means energy consumption 

 will rise sharply in India and in China as their economies 

 grow. Further, energy must be available and affordable for 

 the poor. 

 Both demand and supply must be 

 managed. Setting standards for all energy-using equipment, 

 monitoring them and penalizing those who cross maximum levels 

 can improve energy efficiencies. Thailand has an energy 

 to gross domestic product growth ratio of 1.2:1, and aims 

 by 2011 to reduce it to 0.85:1. Indias primary energy to 

 GDP ratio in 1991-2000 was 0.907, for electricity it was 

 1.213. It must improve. 

 An efficient operation of generation 

 and distribution by modernizing old and small plants is 

 a quick and low-cost method. The average plant load factor 

 for Indian plants in 2003-04 was 68.4 per cent but in Bihar 

 it was 37.6, Jharkhand 23.1 and the North-east 14.0. China 

 is shutting down all thermal plants below 100 MW capacity 

 to improve overall plant efficiency. The National Thermal 

 Power Corporation has demonstrated its ability in improving 

 efficiencies in old plants and this expertise must be exploited. 

 There are technical as well as commercial losses (theft) 

 of electricity. Reducing technical losses to international 

 levels from the present 10 per cent will free more energy 

 for consumption with no additional emissions. 

 India is not using 75 per cent 

 of its hydroelectric potential. This can add over 60,000 

 MW of generating capacity. Similarly, nuclear power accounts 

 for hardly 3 per cent of our present total electricity-generating 

 capacity of around 120,000 MW. But even if the world gives 

 us better technology and uranium fuel, nuclear power will 

 not exceed 5 per cent of demand in 20 years. There remain 

 problems of disposal of nuclear waste and the possibility 

 that terrorists could get hold of enriched uranium and blackmail 

 society. But we must pursue all avenues of reducing coal 

 usage. 

 There is potential for generating 

 non-polluting power through windmills, solar panels and 

 solar cells, harnessing geothermal energy, using biomass 

 and agricultural products. Wind speeds vary; hence wind 

 power generation varies, and must be supported by more certain 

 base load power from coal or gas or nuclear. (Base load 

 power demand is power that is constantly needed). Solar 

 panels and cells are still high-cost and useful for remote 

 areas or households. Geothermal energy is a technology still 

 under experimentation. Biomass can help in small-scale generation 

 and is useful for village-level generation and distribution 

 without using the grid. Cost reduction, and institutions 

 to manage it commercially, must be developed. Agricultural 

 products like ethanol could, in a land-short country like 

 India, adversely affect availability of sugar, food and 

 other commercial crops. Further, all these sources are likely 

 to produce more expensive power less than our needs. This 

 bunch of technologies has limited value for us. 

 Only coal, of which we have large 

 reserves, and gas, which is being found in increasing quantities 

 in India, can meet the explosion in our energy demand, even 

 if all other sources are exploited fully. But Indian coal 

 has a high ash content (though low in sulphur that causes 

 acid rain in parts of China). Carbon emissions cause global 

 warming and climate change. New technologies are required 

 to get more energy out of the same quantity of coal and 

 also reduce carbon emissions. 

 Some ways to use less energy without 

 lessening comforts: improve efficiency of lighting appliances, 

 tax inefficient appliances, make rules for buildings and 

 factories to make them more energy efficient, set standards 

 for energy using equipment such as our inefficient agricultural 

 pump sets. 

 Available technologies or those 

 under development for reducing carbon emissions in generation 

 are gasifying coal, pulverizing coal before use, washing 

 coal, sequestering carbon emissions in underground caves 

 or under the oceans, and using efficient combustion to get 

 more electricity from the same coal. 

 Pulverizing coal before use is 

 perhaps the quickest method, with technology already in 

 use on which further cost reduction is possible. Coal washing 

 is also a known technology, but at present adds to the cost. 

 Research to reduce costs is essential. Sequestering carbon 

 emissions is a new technology still being tried in some 

 developed countries. It may not offer much benefit,but we 

 need to develop expertise in it. 

 Advanced coal combustion technologies, 

 with the use of supercritical steam cycle technologies and 

 integrated gasification combined cycle plants, reduce carbon 

 emissions for the same amount of energy. Ultra mega power 

 projects are to use supercritical technology. There is little 

 Indian research and development on these technologies and 

 to reduce their costs. Investment is especially important 

 because our coal is of a different quality from that in 

 most of Europe and the US. It is thought that IGCC is a 

 good possibility though, even in developed countries, the 

 technology is 20 years away from actuality. Another problem 

 with these technologies is their high capital costs.

 India, China, Japan and South 

 Korea together have high foreign exchange reserves and are 

 energy-short, importing an increasing proportion of global 

 oil and gas. Using our combined clout to create a buyer 

 cartel for oil, gas, uranium, and so on, collaborating in 

 manufacturing equipment for our countries, and negotiating 

 to get international prices down, must be priorities. Asian 

 countries could optimize on power usage through a regional 

 grid. We could set common standards for generation and energy 

 using equipment and share our experiences in renovation 

 and modernization to get more out of old plants. Most important, 

 we could set up collaborative research and development in 

 a network of laboratories over the region. 

 Fiscal measures can redirect demand 

 to energy-efficient equipment. Increased taxes can shift 

 consumers from polluting to non-polluting fuels, for example, 

 from diesel or petrol to CNG. Banks could lend on long tenures 

 for energy-efficient technologies so that repayment can 

 be spread over more years. A shorter tenure puts a greater 

 burden on the immediate tariff that the consumer has to 

 pay. 

 An alternative to coal is gas 

 used for generating power. The cost of imported gas, whether 

 by sea or by land from Iran, Burma or Bangladesh, will be 

 far higher in cost than coal and result in non-affordable 

 power tariffs. However, the substantial gas discoveries 

 in recent years enable us to greatly increase the use of 

 gas for generating power. Gas does not have the pollution 

 and emission problems associated with coal. But it must 

 be priced at levels that the Indian power consumer can afford. 

 The government should take its royalties from gas fields 

 in kind and use them for the central power and fertilizer 

 plants. 

 For private generators, independent 

 tariff regulation of gas must be introduced. This must allow 

 the gas producer adequate margins to cover his exploration 

 and production risks, but not the windfall profits that 

 arise because of the wildly rising international gas prices 

 because of war and cartels. Domestic gas must be reserved 

 for power (and possibly fertilizer). It must also be priced 

 at levels affordable for the power user. This will be helped 

 if we had a common independent energy regulator to determine 

 tariffs for power, coal and gas.

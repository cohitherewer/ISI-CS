 MATTER OF COURSE

 For the state and Central governments, certain natural disasters have become a matter of course. They happen every year, and they happen to the poor. Thousands of people in Malda and Murshidabad lose their homes and agricultural land to the Ganga, Phulhar and Mahananda rivers. The rivers run well above their extreme danger levels at this time of the year, flood their banks and devour the cultivated land and villages on their banks. This has given rise to a rapidly growing number of internally displaced people in the area, whose lives are led in a state of poverty, danger and radical uncertainty. In the last couple of months, at least three villages have been entirely gobbled up by the rivers, depriving several thousands of people of their homes and livelihood. A woman died of enteric disease because she could not be taken to the nearest health centre. And with the water-level still dangerously high, the situation is likely to get worse. This has been happening annually ever since people have started living and farming here. It is the same, richly alluvial rivers that ensure a high degree of fertility along their banks and in the chars (islands formed by silt deposit) that appear and disappear in their midst.

 Calling such an annual disaster natural is not entirely accurate. The Farakka Barrage has a crucial role to play in the behaviour of the rivers in this region, and there is scope for a more fundamental approach to the problem beyond the routine relief and rehabilitation that it moves the government to every year. The entire situation is now impossibly mired in a kind of inhuman politics. Flood management, including river erosion, being a State subject, there is a constant passing of the buck between the state and Central governments, and a tussle over who is to fund the strengthening of the embankments. The Farakka Barrage Authority, a Central agency, declares itself perpetually short of funds and puts the ball in the district administrations court. And this has been going on as annually as the bhangan itself.

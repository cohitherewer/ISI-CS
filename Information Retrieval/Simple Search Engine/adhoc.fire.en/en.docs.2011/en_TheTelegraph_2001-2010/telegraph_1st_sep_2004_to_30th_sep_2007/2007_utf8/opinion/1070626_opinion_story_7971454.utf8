 REGAIN LOST 

 PRIDE 

 MALAFIDE

 Malvika Singh

 Away 

 from Delhi, away from newspapers and television, life in 

 Maheshwar, on the banks of the Narmada river, is languid 

 and seemingly effortless despite the scorching heat and 

 intense humidity in Madhya Pradesh. It makes no difference 

 to the pace of life here, to the patience of the people 

 who are compelled to live a dismal life without the basic 

 infrastructure in place, whether A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, or 

 Bhairon Singh Shekhawat are going to fight Pratibha Patil 

 to live in a palace that was built for the viceroy of India. 

 They understand well that a native viceroy has replaced 

 the colonial representative and that this election will 

 make no difference to the quality of their life. They know 

 that no one cares.

 India is developing and getting 

 on despite the failure of governance, and in spite of the 

 endless leaders who have betrayed their constituents. People 

 have to survive in order to pass the baton to their next 

 generation and, having lost faith in governments that have 

 stalled rather than encouraged entrepreneurship, they have 

 evolved their own strategies to move ahead. This has led 

 to chaos and anarchy in growth patterns that have destroyed 

 the environment. 

 Indore is an urban mess where 

 the roads are potholed, where road rules are never adhered 

 to, where wealth is being generated but there is no reflection 

 of it in the public space. What is this terrible malady 

 that afflicts our towns and cities? Why has the governance 

 of India, over the last sixty years, been so utterly abysmal? 

 And why is no one made accountable? To destroy this ancient 

 civilization must be deemed a criminal act. 

 Need of the day

 The success stories that reflect 

 the energy of India, that manifest the diverse skills, the 

 new and positive realities of an India breaking loose from 

 its historical shackles, are all in the private domain, 

 initiated and nurtured by those who do not belong to the 

 government but have a commitment to Bharat. In Maheshwar, 

 a traditional weaving centre which had lost its special 

 skill over the years, Richard Holkar had orchestrated a 

 revival of its artistic skills over two decades ago. It 

 began as a small enterprise. With its gradual but systematic 

 success, and the larger village, influenced by this private 

 endeavour, also began to renew its old connection with weaving. 

 Today there are at least 1,000 functioning looms, operated 

 by men and women whose ancestors had been weavers. This 

 sleepy village I had first visited in 1988 has, over the 

 years, grown into a small but prosperous town.

 It is this pride that needs 

 to be kindled and nurtured. It is this that will change 

 Bharat and take India into another time and space without 

 losing the countless strengths that drew the world to our 

 feet a long, long time ago. This is not nostalgia, nor is 

 it a way to romanticize our country. It is a truth that 

 began to disappear, sometime in the Sixties, when those 

 who ruled us began to clone what they believed was a first 

 world because it was dollar-rich. Priorities changed rather 

 rapidly as the best of the sophisticated East was replaced 

 by a mass market oriented to the middle-class West. And, 

 we lost it. We lost our centre and our pride. 

 Governments, consisting of bureaucrats 

 and politicians, cannot give us our sense of pride in what 

 we do, in what we excel at, in what we are. They are merely 

 tools that should provide the infrastructure for us to work 

 and generate wealth wealth of ideas, of philosophies, 

 of products and more. Successive governments have failed 

 to preserve the dignity of civil society. If one aspect 

 worked and grew well, the other, equally important, aspect 

 failed and let us down. The left hand was not in sync with 

 the right and it continues to be that way. Governance today 

 is a charade that is being enacted for us. But Indians are 

 angry. Urgent remedial actions are the need of the day.

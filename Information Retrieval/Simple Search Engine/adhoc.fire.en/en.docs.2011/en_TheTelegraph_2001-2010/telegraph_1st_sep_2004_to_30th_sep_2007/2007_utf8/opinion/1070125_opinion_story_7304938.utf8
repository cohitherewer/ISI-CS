 TRIAL COURSE

 It was Ms Zahira Sheikh, with her infamous retractions in the Best Bakery trial, who came to represent the problem of, and the problem with, witnesses in India. On the one hand, there was the irrefutable evidence of their vulnerability to machinations by their adversaries, and on the other, their formidable ability to confound the course of justice by turning hostile in court. Innumerable cases, particularly the recent trials of Jessica Lal and Nitish Katara, have reinforced this contrary image. Yet, both these images result from the witnesses powerlessness before people and parties who command enormous social and political clout and are capable of buying them out with the help of money or force. If it is fear which discourages one from deposing in court, it is also fear which prompts many to seek a leeway through perjury. It has been some time since the law commission, several committees and concerned public bodies have been asking for a comprehensive witness protection programme. However, the Supreme Court has been a little more pragmatic in its approach to the problem. It has ruled out as physically impossible any effort to guarantee protection to the countless witnesses who appear before the court. And in pursuance of its commitment to the constitutional provision of equality, it has further emphasized that it is unlikely to change its mind even in cases that are considered in the public arena as deserving. 

 The apex courts wisdom cannot be faulted. No individual can be regarded as more deserving than any other for protection from a democratic state. The law and the law-enforcing agencies are required to make no such distinction. The reality might be different, but that cannot be reason for deflecting from an ideal. The practicality of this approach, in fact, shows up the system for what it is not. It is for the law-enforcers to ensure that no one is discriminated against in his fight for justice. Unfortunately, they are equally to blame for the play of money and muscle that weakens the witnesss resolve. When the bungling police, partial investigative agencies and public prosecutors of questionable integrity mislead the courts, is there any way the incorruptibility of the witness alone can assure justice for the victim? If there has to be fair play, no one should be allowed to influence the dispensation of justice.

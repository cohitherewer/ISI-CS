The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 COMMON FACTOR

 There seem to be no patterns, no typical terrorist profile, but only ever-widening connections. Yet, an intriguing common factor links the eight people arrested after the three car-bomb episodes in London and Glasgow. All of them have links with the National Health Service in Britain: seven are doctors or medical students and one worked as a laboratory technician. Their geographical spread is also truly international: Australia, India, Iraq and Jordan. The 7/7 bombings in London seemed to throw up a different kind of man the radicalized British Islamist who seemed to ask for a different kind of watchfulness and introspection from his country. Now the surveillance and intelligence will have to shed this home-grown approach and look wider. Already, Britains new prime minister has asked the new terrorism minister to conduct an immediate review as to what arrangements we must make in relation to recruitment to the NHS. The shadow health secretary has also questioned why his country was recruiting doctors from developing countries in the prohibited list (prohibited in order to prevent brain drain). It must be remembered, though, that none of the arrested has been charged with any offence, and the police have 28 days to interrogate them. But a narrative is already beginning to form around the NHS angle of a few jihadists, manipulated by a distant guiding hand, infiltrating the NHS and indoctrinating other brilliant, apparently innocuous-looking good Muslims who have come in to work in the United Kingdom from west Asia or Asia.

 This sinister convergence of two forms of globalization, of work and of terror, could help combine the forces of two seemingly distinct kinds of racist anxiety. For foreign doctors and medical students trying to make it within the NHS, this could not have happened at a worse time. Just a few months ago, they were fighting a court case regarding their employment status against a current of professional and political opinion favouring the recruitment of doctors and trainees from Britain and the European Union. Hence, when the anxiety of foreigners taking away all the work dovetails into the fear of imported terror, a rather dangerous form of multiculturalism could be the result. Word is already going round that a British Anglican cleric in Baghdad had received a warning from an al Qaida leader that people who cure you would kill you.

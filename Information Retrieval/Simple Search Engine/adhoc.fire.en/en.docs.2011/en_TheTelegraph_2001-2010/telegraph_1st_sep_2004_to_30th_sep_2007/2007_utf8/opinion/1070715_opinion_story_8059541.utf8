 THE NEW AND THE OLD

 There is something mind-numbingly boring about uniformity. Yet much of what goes by the name of mass culture is based on uniformity. Such is the reach and influence of this culture that it has begun to affect many would argue adversely what were once exclusive preserves. Take an example from the wine industry of Europe. Traditionally, Europe, and more specifically France, has produced the best wines in the world. For many years, French wines dominated the world market the top end and wines for mass consumption. This dominance has been challenged by wines made in the New World in California and Chile particularly. The hallmark of these wines is their uniformity. These wines are not too expensive, and drinkable. They please every palate, such is their uniformity. It is difficult to complain about wines from the New World. This challenge is having an odd impact on the wine industry in Europe.

 The EU has asked wine-growers to uproot excess vines and replace them by planting grapes of a more popular variety. It is true that Europe has an enormous amount of excess wine, hence the phrase wine lake. But that does not explain why grapes of a more popular variety need to be planted. This is clearly an attempt to keep up and compete with the wines from the New World. In other words, Europe, to maintain its dominance over the global wine market, is trying to encounter the New World by becoming more like the New World. One way of seeing this is to see the European wine-making tradition as being flexible and adaptable to changing conditions. Another way of looking at the same development is to see Europe surrendering its own exclusivity which was its strength, or, to use the marketing jargon, its unique selling point. The old world meets the new by becoming more like the new.

 This is one of the more threatening aspects of mass culture. It has behind it the strength of numbers and thus swamps exclusivity. One of the worst affected areas by this tendency is the book trade in the western world. There was a time when most of the old cities of Europe had charming and small bookshops that were individually owned and served a small but loyal set of customers. The owner was often an eccentric who loved books first and profits after that. London was dotted with such bookshops, some of which, like Heywood Hills bookshop in Mayfair and John Sandos in Chelsea, have become the stuff of London lore. But many of these shops have now gone yielding place to chain bookstores, and have thus lost their individual characters. The idea of chain comes from across the pond, and is obviously geared towards mass consumption. There is cause for lament here and also to ponder about the absence of choice.

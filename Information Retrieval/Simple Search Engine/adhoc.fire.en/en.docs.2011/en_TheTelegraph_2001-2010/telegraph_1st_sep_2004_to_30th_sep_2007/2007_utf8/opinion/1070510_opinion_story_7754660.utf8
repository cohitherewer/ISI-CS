 Letters to Editor

 Divided practice

 Sir An enviable education does not necessarily come with the promise of humane conduct. The deplorable behaviour of upper caste students, attending one of the premier medical colleges in the country, towards fellow lower caste candidates has revealed this truth clearly (AIIMS apartheid, cricket to class, May 7). Ever since the issue of reservations was initiated by the human resource development minister, Arjun Singh, last year, much has been written and said about other backward classes. From the antagonism of the students at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences , it appears, that the debate has been sidelined in favour of the usual prejudices against the lower castes. 

 It would not be wrong to claim that the discrimination against underprivileged people would not have escalated to this extent without the political drama that had unfolded around the question of caste. Earlier, students were less sensitive to such questions. Caste was never uppermost on their minds. However, with the increasing role of caste and religious identity in electoral politics, discrimination in educational institutions was bound to happen sooner or later.

 Yours faithfully,

Monika Pathak, B.S. City, Jharkhand

 Sir It is shocking to learn about the humiliation meted out by the AIIMS administration and some upper caste students towards scheduled caste and scheduled tribe students. This incident shows, yet again, that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination of the United Nations was right in reprimanding India in the matter of Dalit oppression. The committee felt that Indias record of social justice towards lower castes indicated nothing less than an apartheid. If such practices can prevail at the AIIMS, which is considered to be one of the most reputed medical institutions in India, it is not difficult to imagine how bad the picture might be at lesser-known centres. In a way, this incident exposes the failure of higher education in that it has not enlightened the young sufficiently. It is also frightening to imagine what the fate of the lower caste patients might turn out to be at the hands of upper caste doctors. The government should immediately implement the recommendations of the committee headed by Sukhdeo Thorat. The students and members of the administrative body who were responsible for the humiliation of the lower castes should be identified and exemplary punishment handed out to them.

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Barasat

 Sir The harassment faced by lower caste students at the AIIMS is hardly surprising. Indian society has always been divided on the lines of caste and community. Hence, there are stereotypes about the Marwaris, Bengalis, Sardarjis and so on. These identities are often used pejoratively by the members of one community against those of another, whom they clearly consider to be inferior. Such inter-community feelings find a more vicious parallel in caste sentiments. If the predominant attitude to caste is to change in this country, then the reforms must happen at a more fundamental level. 

 Yours faithfully,

V.S. Giri, Calcutta

 Sir The continued bickering between the Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, and the director of AIIMS, P. Venugopal, is going from bad to worse. Ever since Venugopals peremptory dismissal as the AIIMS director by Ramadoss, which was subsequently stayed by the Delhi High Court, the relations between the two men have been worsening. Apparently, the health minister wants to teach Venugopal a lesson for his leniency towards students protesting against the Centres plan for 27 per cent reservation for other backward classes. 

 The revelations made by the Thorat Committee report on caste bias among students at the AIIMS are hard to believe. It seems unlikely that students attending such elite institutions would behave so appallingly against members of their peer group. It is also strange that an injustice of this order left the students union relatively unmoved.

 Yours faithfully, 

J. Akshay, Secunderabad 

 Sickness and recovery

 Sir I could not believe my eyes when I saw the news report, Neglect kills baby (May 3). It said that the authorities of a nursing home on Southern Avenue admitted negligence by its doctor, after a newborn died following an overdose of anaesthesia to the mother. The mother is still in a critical condition. But if it is really true that the hospital authorities admitted negligence on the part of their doctor, then this piece of news deserved a place of prominence on Page 1. While stories of medical negligence have become regular features in newspapers these days, a hospital accepting its doctors fault is almost unheard of in medical practice in West Bengal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir The mob violence at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute on May 1 after the death of an infant allegedly because of medical negligence is yet another example of how, with any handy pretext, a group of people can go on a rampage, causing damage to public utilities. The entire incident was extensively beamed by several leading television channels. One look at the footage, and any sensible person would be horrified that the civil society has accommodated such rogues in its fold. 

 I have had the experience of working in various parts of the country. Nowhere have I seen such indifference of the law-enforcing authorities against such social terrorists. Such mindless violence and destructive mode of protests need to be put down with an iron hand. 

 Yours faithfully,

Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir Did the bloody nose of a failed Indian captain deserve so much space on the front page on a Sunday morning (May 6)? Surely The Telegraph readers have better things to do than contemplate what Rahul Dravid should have done to protect his nose?

 Yours faithfully,

Balbir Singh, Jamshedpur

 FOGGY PAST

 Indians have a strange sense of history. As long as a document reposes in a private collection, it is as if it never existed. The moment it is up for auction, Indians discover its invaluable importance in their history, their sense of nation, their contemporary conflicts. Mahatma Gandhis draft article for the Urdu Harijan had existed from 19 days before his death in 1948, and had become part of the collection of great mens letters and articles owned by Albin Schram, an Austrian in Switzerland. But the moment it became an item for an auction by Christies, Indians felt they could not do without it. Whether it is an illusionary idea of national prestige or the excitement of a historical find that prompts this grabbing is not clear. India is quite unable to look after its own past, but it will not let others keep its mementos either. Apparently Gandhi had willed the copyright of all such materials to the Navjivan Trust in Ahmedabad.

 The word copyright is pure magic. Indians feel possessive about their greats, and the copyright-holders of these greats feel possessive about their copyrights. No international code is followed. There is always a mad scramble to extend copyright when its expiry approaches Rabindranath Tagores is a typical example. While this can be perceived as fear of losing a golden goose on the part of a copyright-holder, it is also part of a general possessiveness: a secretiveness and denial of transparency that has serious effects on an Indians sense of the past. It is almost as if the publics access to old letters, papers, even pictures, will taint the documents in some way, and encourage people to think independently about their history. Both, possibly, are equally worrying. Even the CIA makes its documents public after a fixed period. But Indians, even when they apply for access through the Right to Information Act, are fobbed off with the bogey of danger to national security. This is determined by the State, and with the Official Secrets Act as a dark immovable screen, there is no way to access documents that would help India understand its own history, even if it is fifty years old. Declassification is a concept carefully kept at bay by the establishment. The fuss over the Gandhi document and the celebration of its contents are in ridiculous contrast to the caginess regarding documents the Indian government does have in its possession. It is a pity that these double standards are exhibited without the least finesse.

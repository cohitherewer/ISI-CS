 TALKING POINT

 All negotiations begin as hard bargains. But compromises and conciliations alone can make them successful. If the Naga peace talks have eluded a happy ending so far, the reason lies in the two complex issues of Naga nationality and the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas. Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, general secretary of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, has been involved in the peace process for far too long not to know this. He should, therefore, know that New Delhi cannot ignore the sentiments of the people of Manipur when it deals with the NSCNs demand for the integration of Naga-inhabited places in the North-east. The Naga-dominated districts of Manipur constitute a large part of the state. If the Centre decides to carve out that part from Manipur and join it to Nagaland, it would be seen as a great betrayal in the former state. How dangerous such a course can be was demonstrated by the violence in the Imphal valley four years ago. Mr Muivah is right when he argues that the coming elections in Manipur should not be a condition for the Naga peace talks. A peaceful resolution of the five decade-old Naga conflict is far more important than the elections in a particular state. No responsible government should sacrifice the larger interest of peace to the exigencies of local politics. But, Manipurs interest, as distinct from the states electoral context, has its relevance to the Naga peace talks.

 However, Mr Muivah can justifiably feel upset that he failed to meet Mr Manmohan Singh during his visit to New Delhi last week. The men in the prime ministers office should have known better. Even if such a meeting failed to break any new ground, it would have served as a positive gesture. Such gestures go a long way in creating the right atmosphere for peace negotiations. The record of the NSCN, led by Mr Muivah and Mr Isak Chishi Swu, in prolonging the ceasefire in Nagaland has been generally unexceptionable. The Centre should do nothing to spoil the spirit of accommodation that is so vital for the success of the talks. It must not let the divisions in the Naga society colour the peace talks. Governments in New Delhi and Kohima had made this mistake in the past, thereby complicating matters. There is no doubt that the NSCN, led by Mr Muivah and Mr Swu, has the largest mandate from the people of Nagaland to talk to New Delhi on their behalf.

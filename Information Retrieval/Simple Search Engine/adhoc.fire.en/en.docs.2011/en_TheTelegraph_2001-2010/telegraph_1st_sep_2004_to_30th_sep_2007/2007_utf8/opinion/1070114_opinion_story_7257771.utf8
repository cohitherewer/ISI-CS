 DIARY

 Moninder Singh Pandher, the alleged mastermind of the horror at Nithari, has scalped an unexpected victim the Congress party. At a time when Congressmen were busy chalking out strategies to corner CM Mulayam Singh Yadav over police inaction in the disappearance of children, skeletons came tumbling out of the Congresss own cupboard. The killer has been widely reported to be a relative of a Congress MP from Punjab. The recent discovery of four more bodies of small children from a warehouse owned by Congressman, Jagmeet Singh Brar, in Punjabs Muktsar has undoubtedly made matters worse. Brars supporters, however, claim that this was a dirty trick pulled on him by his long-term opponent, Amarinder Singh, to put him on the backfoot before the distribution of party tickets. As is their wont, politicians are busy politicizing the tragedy, while parents of the murdered children wait for justice. A sordid saga indeed.

 The Bachchans seem to be running on faith. Their visit the Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai is now history. It was, ostensibly, to pray for a decent opening for Guru, a flick starring small B. But if Bachchan-watchers are to be believed, the trio visit the temple regularly, almost once in every month. This, apart from their trips to Varanasi, Ajmer and the dargah at Mahim. However, not all the visits have to do with warding off the manglik curse. The chips seem to be down for Bollywoods first family. Big B was replaced by Shah Rukh Khan for the upcoming KBC series. The son has not fared much better either. Abhishek, reportedly, did not get to shake a leg during the Filmfare awards for demanding an exorbitant fee. He also lost out on Rakeysh Mehras new project, besides getting a rather tepid response for his performance in Umrao Jaan, which also featured his lady love. The temple-hopping must have surely taken a toll on Abhishek. Otherwise, why would he sleep-walk through his roles in his last few films? 

 Narendra Modis a born orator. Put him in front of any large crowd and the Gujarat CM, an accomplished public speaker, will start working his charm. Modis oratory skills were on display again at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in New Delhi. Modi received a standing ovation from the delegates after he extolled the virtues of his government. This proved too much for the Haryana CM, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who too tried to hardsell his state. But Modi was quick to nip Hoodas sales pitch by pointing out Gujarats superior growth curve and resources. Modi may have won pravasi hearts, but will that help him win desi votes in the next elections?

 Pranab Mukherjee may not be the defence minister anymore but that has not stopped him from raising war cries occasionally. At a core committee meeting, Mukherjee, covered in woollens from head to toe, announced that he had declared war with immediate effect. When a worried PM asked who the adversary was, the external affairs minister replied that he had declared war on the cold! That certainly helped raise the temperature, even it was only inside the room.

 Does anyone in the Congress remember Sitaram Kesri? Going by the experience of, Amarnath, Sitarams son, the answer must be a no. Amarnath has been doing the rounds of 24 Akbar Road and 10 Janpath, but he does not have much to show for all the hard work. Neither Sonia Gandhi nor Manmohan Singh has had time to listen to the old mans plea. Kesri Jr wants his son, Santosh, to join the Congress, but there seems to be no takers for the idea. A desperate Amarnath, a heart patient, declared that he had no political ambition and that he wanted his son to take Sitarams legacy forward. Given the Cong- resss present attitude towards the former party chief, it seems that Amarnath is heading for another heart break. 

 India may have turned into a technology hub, but then there are certain things in the country that have managed to retain the old world charm. Consider this. A journalist recently went to withdraw some money from an ATM of a renowned private bank. He pushed the card in, punched in his pin number and waited for the money to appear. Out popped the receipt, showing that the sum had been debited from his account. But there was no sign of the money. The distraught man then did what most Indians would do at such a critical moment he began to bang the sides of the machine. But there was still no sign of the promised notes. Finally, he managed to get in touch with the branch manager and recounted his experience with the machine. The bleary-eyed manager asked our man not to lose sleep on the matter. He said that the bank will correct the entry in the account and promised that our man will get his money back the next day.

 VOTE FOR INDUSTRY

 It is never easy, especially in India, to make sense of the peoples electoral choices. But one thing about this weeks civic and rural polls in Bengal seems to be beyond doubt. Local issues notwithstanding, it was essentially a vote on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees agenda for industrial development. Months of street battles and political debates over the issue formed the backdrop to the poll. In fact, the unrest that followed the governments botched attempts at acquiring land for a chemical hub in Nandigram, and the subsequent police firing there, gave the local polls a rare political significance. The results indicate, however, that the states biggest political storm in recent years made little difference to the peoples voting behaviour. Mr Bhattacharjee may be justified in claiming that it was one more mandate, like the one in last years assembly elections, for his agenda for Bengals industrial rejuvenation. Even in Panskura, where the Left lost the control of the municipality, the vote was not necessarily against the governments industrialization policy. Even Mamata Banerjee attributed the oppositions victory there not to the peoples anti-industrialization sentiments, but to the success of the mahajot or grand alliance of anti-Left parties. This is a clear and honest admission of the fact that political arithmetic, rather than any Nandigram effect, led to the Lefts fall in Panskura. 

 However, the larger question is whether electoral politics should be allowed to stand in the way of economic development. Politicians may have their vested interests in spreading confusions and even inciting trouble over economic issues. But Mr Bhattacharjee cannot afford to be swayed by small-time politics. After decades of industrial decline, Bengal is at the crossroads of a recovery. History will be made when the Tata groups small car rolls out of the Singur factory. It will be the cheapest car ever made and will park itself in history alongside Fords Model T, Volkswagens Beetle and the British Motor Corporations Mini. The proposed chemical hub, which sparked the unending violence in Nandigram, could unleash a wave of new economic activities in Bengal. More important, the new projects together symbolize the coming of a new era. Even the most obstructive of politicians cannot keep a good idea down. But Bengals politicians are not known for taking the right lessons from history.

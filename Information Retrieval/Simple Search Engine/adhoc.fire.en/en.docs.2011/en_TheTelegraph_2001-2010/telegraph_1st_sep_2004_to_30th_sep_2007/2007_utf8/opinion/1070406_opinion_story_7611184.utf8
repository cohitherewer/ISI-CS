The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WITHOUT CARE

 The rescue and resuscitation of an elderly woman in posh south Calcutta reinforces a stereotype a progressive societys progressive lack of sensitivity towards the old and the vulnerable. There can be no doubting Ms Chhabi Guptas helplessness, notwithstanding her social or financial status. Like many of her age, she has been left to take care of herself in a phase of life when she needs assistance the most. In the West, with a welfare system in place (in most countries) that assures the elderly basic services like healthcare or help in an emergency, survival would have been less of a problem. Not so in India, where a rapidly developing society is yet to replace the older social structure of familial care with a workable alternative. The result is quite disastrous. The elderly find themselves victims of unspeakable cruelties not only from strangers they have to recruit as domestic help, but also from family members who sometimes fleece them or turn them out of their own house. The depredations have got both Central and state governments thinking hard. The Andhra Pradesh government has passed a bill that enables the elderly to claim maintenance and shelter from their children. The parliament too has recently admitted a bill, which makes it mandatory for citizens to provide sustenance and help for parents and grandparents, the failure of which is expected to invite severe penalties. 

 One wonders if legal threats can ensure compliance, or whether they are at all an admirable option for the aged. How many elderly people could be coaxed to file cases against their children, blaming them for a situation which is often beyond their control? Would Ms Gupta have done so? The elderly are entitled to a life of dignity as also to their freedom to choose a life they want to live. It is for society to ensure them these choices. A quality life for the geriatric population can be guaranteed by greater vigilance on the part of the State. Much of this is a responsibility that has to be discharged by the police force, which should be sensitized to its role as provider of such care. But it is impossible for the State to monitor matters thoroughly or to give the aged the mental succour they need. The latter has to be provided by the community, which will play its deemed role only when it learns to value senior members of society as its integral and irreplaceable part.

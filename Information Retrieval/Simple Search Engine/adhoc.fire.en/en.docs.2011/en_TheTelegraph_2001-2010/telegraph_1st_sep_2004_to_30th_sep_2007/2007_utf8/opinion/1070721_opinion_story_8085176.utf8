 TALES FROM 

 A FORGOTTEN WORLD 

 THIS ABOVE ALL

 Khushwant Singh

 The inner eye 

 It is not surprising that many 

 of our top writers of English fiction prefer to live abroad 

 rather than in their own homeland. Raja Rao and Govind Desani 

 lived most of their later years in Austin, Texas. Ruth Prawer 

 Jhabvala, Ved Mehta, Salman Rushdie, Anita Desai, her daughter 

 Kiran, Jhumpa Lahiri and Richard Crasta live in New York, 

 M.G. Vassanji and Anita Rau Badami live in Canada. V.S. 

 Naipaul, Vikram Seth and Jaishree Misra live in England. 

 This is understandable because New York and London are capitals 

 of the English literary world, where publishers offer millions 

 in advance royalties that Indian publishers cannot afford. 

 India gets the left-overs and gratuity.

 A new star has risen in world 

 of English fiction by Indians not in the Indian firmament 

 but in a non-English-speaking country, in Denmark. He is 

 Tabish Khair, a Bihari teaching English at Aarhus University 

 in Copenhagen. His first novel, The Bus Stopped, 

 published in England, was set entirely in India. His second, 

 Filming: A Love Story, was again released first in 

 England and will be available in India shortly. I have little 

 doubt that it will establish Tabish Khair in the top rung 

 of Indian authors writing in English.

 Filming is a poor title 

 for a beautifully-crafted novel. The only justification 

 for this is the chief characters obsession with making 

 a film, Aakhri Raat, and making a name for himself 

 in the film world.

 The principal character of the 

 novel is a Bengali Brahmin named Hari, who is a clerk in 

 a post-office in Calcutta. He spends his days sorting out 

 letters and dreaming of making a film. He is a bachelor 

 who frequents a brothel run by a Muslim lady. Hari gets 

 attached to the brothel-keepers daughter. With her he shares 

 his dreams. She dreams of becoming a respectable housewife 

 with a home of her own. Hari quits his job, hires a projector, 

 a few old films, a bullock-cart and a couple of assistants 

 to show his films in towns and villages in Bengal and Bihar. 

 His prostitute lady-friend quits the brothel to join him, 

 takes on the Hindu name, Durga, to help him with his peripatetic 

 cinema shows by singing and dancing during intervals. They 

 have a son, Ashok. He grows up into a handsome, grey-eyed 

 lad, and enjoys running behind his parents bullock-cart 

 as it moves from village to village.

 There is a dramatic change in 

 their lives when they arrive at Anjangarh, owned by a well-to-do 

 family of Thakurs who live in a sprawling haveli, 

 divided into parts to house different kinsmen. The head 

 lives by himself and is rarely seen. His wife, the malkin, 

 presides over feeding arrangements and childrens welfare, 

 and is know to them as Badi Ma. She lost her only 

 son, Ashok, when he was only seven. Her husbands younger 

 brother, the only one who went to college briefly, is more 

 interested in singing and dancing and is probably gay. He 

 allows the bioscopewallahs to set up their show. 

 He visits it and invites Durga to the haveli not to make 

 love to her but to practice dancing. The bioscopewallahs 

 are asked to move into the haveli. Badi Ma persuades them 

 to give their Ashok to her in adoption for a tidy sum of 

 money. Hari and Durga move to the film-capital, Bombay. 

 She takes on a new name, Bhuvaneshwari. They run into another 

 pair of would-be film-makers: Salim Lahori, son of a Muslim 

 prostitute in Lahori Gate, Delhi, and her husband, a Maulvi 

 Sahib. They acquire a studio, a few hours drive from Bombay, 

 and get down to filming Aakhri Raat.

 India begins to come to a boiling 

 point as the day of transfer of power from the British comes 

 closer. Hindu-Muslim riots break out all over the country. 

 Trains full of dead bodies cross over from nascent Pakistan 

 to India and from India into the nascent Pakistan. Bhuvaneshwari 

 adopts two little children, who have narrowly escaped being 

 massacred. Salim Lahori and a few other Muslims refuse to 

 leave India. Right-wing Hindu militant groups led by the 

 RSS want to drive Muslims out of India. They would like 

 Mahatma Gandhi to be killed by a Muslim so that their task 

 should become easier. They run out of patience and a day 

 before the Gandhis assassination they attack the studio 

 and set it on fire, killing everyone inside, Hindu, Muslim, 

 adults and children. The news barely gets any mention because 

 of the murder of Gandhi.

 It is as powerful a tale of love, 

 and a heart-rending tragedy, as I have read, on the partition 

 of India. The spirit of Saadat Hassan Manto haunts every 

 page. Manto did not want to leave Bombay, until his Hindu 

 friends persuaded him to do so to save his life. He ended 

 up in the Lahore lunatic asylum, which is the background 

 of his immortal story, Toba Tek Singh. It is to Manto 

 that Tabish Khair has dedicated his novel.

 Last years troubles

 A college student challenged a 

 senior citizen saying it was impossible for their generation 

 to understand his.

 You grew up in a different world, 

 the student said, Today we have television, jet planes, 

 space travel, man has walked on the moon, our spaceships 

 have visited Mars. We even have nuclear energy, electric 

 and hydrogen cars, computers with light-speed processing 

 and...

 The old man replied: Youre right. 

 We did not have those things when we were young; so we invented 

 them. Now what on earth are you doing for the next generation?

 A college student introduced his 

 girlfriend to his pal: Meet Miss so-and-so, my cousin. 

 His friend replied, How nice! 

 Last year she was my cousin.

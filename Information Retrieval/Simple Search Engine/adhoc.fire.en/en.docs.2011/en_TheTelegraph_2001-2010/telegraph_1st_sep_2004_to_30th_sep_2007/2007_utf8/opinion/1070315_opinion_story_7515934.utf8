 NEXT CHAPTER

 It would be wrong to reduce the battle for the Maidan to one between the farmers and the golfers. A great deal more is at stake in what the Maidan is coming to mean in the history of Calcuttas civic and environmental consciousness. Who owns the citys commons and what is the most civilized way of enjoying that ownership? A long and revealing struggle finally proved to be not in vain when this years Book Fair was shifted out of the Maidan. This entirely good thing became, by some bizarre definition of culture and tradition, a moment of bereavement for some of the citys intellectuals, expressed in appropriately lugubrious terms. But the sad story is not over yet. The rally held by the farmers wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has left the Maidan ravaged again. The entire stretch between the Victoria Memorial and Eden Gardens, including the premises of the two, was invaded by rallyists who built, cooked, ate, bought, sold, relieved themselves, littered and then left (in huge busfuls, disobeying most traffic rules). Then the partys district committee virtuously sent in their cadre. Its largely cosmetic cleaning-up has not been able to undo the damage that such savaging does to the Maidans. The Calcutta Ladies Golf Club is particularly in despair over their devastated greens, with a couple of tournaments coming up. It will probably be told by the citys political guardians to rectify its lopsided priorities. The secretary of the CPI(M)s peasant wing is indifferent to what his men have not been able to clean up. 

 The state government is yet to build an alternative venue for the fairs, which have been outlawed on the Maidan. It is far from clear whether it is intending to do such a thing at all, having equivocated shamelessly over it for years, before taking resort to breaking the law and talking about culture, infuriating the court and people who rightly mind such callousness. So, suggesting to political parties, and to the government, that heads must be put together to think up another venue for rallies and related arrangements, might appear to be a hopeless exercise to most people who value their time and energy. Yet this will have to be done. Citizens activism is always a better force than judicial activism, especially when the latter invariably leaves the courts ignored and disobeyed by the very people who ought to be maintaining the rule of law.

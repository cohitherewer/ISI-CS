The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IN MANY ACCENTS 

 Stephen Hugh-Jones

 What a difference accent makes 

 to language. Some years ago, an Irish judge died, of sufficient 

 distinction to get an obituary in the London Times. 

 But its most striking point was not his judicial ability, 

 but his detestation of Britain.

 That was no rarity among the elite 

 of the Irish republic. Its iconic leader, amon de Valera, 

 hated the Brits so much that in 1945 he went in person 

 to the German legation to commiserate on the death of Hitler 

 a courtesy he did not parallel even for the United States 

 when Roosevelt died. Later, Irish courts at times went through 

 legal hoops to save IRA gunmen from extradition. What was 

 unusual was this judges way of showing his dislike. At 

 European conferences, wrote his obituarist, he would speak 

 in French rather than English, to avoid being taken for 

 a Brit. 

 To any Briton, that seems ludicrous: 

 merely open your mouth in the accent of southern Ireland, 

 and you proclaim your origins. Yet maybe the late judge 

 was right. Whats obvious to us is not so to many outsiders, 

 however fluent in English. I cant tell the English of a 

 Tamil from that of a Bengali; let alone, despite four years 

 spent in France, the French of Bordeaux from that of Brittany. 

 Would a Frenchman, even one fluent in English, necessarily 

 know the Dublin accent from that of London or Birmingham? 

 Yet distinct enough they are. 

 Any Irishman indeed would query the notion of the accent 

 of his country. There are many, as there are within Britain 

 or America or India. And just as a tone of voice can alter 

 the significance of words, so can accent. 

 I was lately on the phone to what 

 turned out to be a BT call-centre in Delhi. A calm young 

 woman listened patiently to my rage against that shambolic 

 oligopoly; and her replies, in faultless and barely Indian-accented 

 English, persuaded me that someone at BT might actually 

 care.

 Ive had many similar conversations 

 if youve ever met British phone companies or banks youll 

 know why and the replies may have been phrased in English 

 just as faultless. But their accent was at times impenetrable 

 enough to make any over-excited Briton think well of Peter 

 Sellers; and they did not calm this one in the least. Only 

 my realization of my own absurdity did that.

 The issue of accent is today alive 

 within Britain itself. Many British call-centres are located 

 in Scotland. Not only is that cheap, but the accent (in 

 fact, there are several) is also widely thought to sound 

 trustworthy. So it does. But it also sounds very Scottish, 

 and we English me included, for all my Scottish childhood 

 have begun to wonder if we do trust it after all.

 That is not just because of the 

 recent vote in Scotland, amid rising anti-English communalism, 

 that made a secessionist party top dog in the Scottish parliament. 

 Its more to do with who runs England. Scotsmen played a 

 big part in running the British Empire, and, not least, 

 the East India Company. Today, all three of our main party 

 leaders have Scottish surnames, and one is a genuine Scot. 

 Tony Blair is, and sounds, essentially English, despite 

 his Scottish name, descent and education. But his cabinet 

 and party are overweight with Scots, as Labour usually has 

 been. And when shortly he steps down, his assured successor, 

 his long-time chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, 

 is thoroughly Scottish, accent and all.

 The lying about Iraq long ago 

 destroyed faith in Blair. But Brown sounded dependable, 

 and quite often was. And his accent helped one to think 

 so. Now, however, as he gets ready to take Blairs place, 

 it has become counterproductive. The words are the same. 

 But increasingly, in England, they arouse a reflex of hostility. 

 His accent gives them resonances that he does not intend 

 and may not even be aware of: another self-righteous lecture 

 from that goddamned Scot. And resonance is a large part 

 of language.

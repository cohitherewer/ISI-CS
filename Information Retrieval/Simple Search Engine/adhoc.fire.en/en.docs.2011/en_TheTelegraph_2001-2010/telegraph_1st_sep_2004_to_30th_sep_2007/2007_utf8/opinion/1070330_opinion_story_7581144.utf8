 Letters to Editor

 Separate ways

 Sir Danger and Opportunity (March 24) by Sunanda K. Datta-Ray was interesting in many ways. It seems that Datta-Ray takes great pride in the fact that the Chinese authorities were not prevented by the 90,000 land protests in China... from decanting a million people to create the glittering new township of Pudong across the Huangpu river. Datta-Ray also points out that its steel and glass towers and globes proclaim Chinas rapidly growing wealth, hectic financial activity and robust confidence in the globalized future. Coincidentally, I have just finished reading a book titled China Shakes the World, by James Kynge. The author makes no mention of Pudong or the Huangpu river. But Kynge has narrated the stories of other glittering cities and towns coming up in China through similar dictates of the authorities. Kynges book also narrates the environmental and human costs of these projects. For instance, Kynge describes how the once great Yellow River has been reduced to a trickle, or how the Huai river has turned black, and the polluted river basin has become a toxic hazard for the people living there. 

 These facts may not be of any interest to Datta-Ray. But they point to a rather dismal picture. Therefore, it pains me to see a veteran journalist like Datta-Ray making a somewhat dishonest reference to Chinas rapid growth to champion the cause of industrialization in West Bengal. It is true that Bengal has suffered neglect, and has been carrying an ideological baggage for decades. But there can be no cure to the states plight overnight. If the government is serious about taking lessons from the violence in Nandigram, then it should avoid the path taken by China. We have to work out a more humane and participatory method when it comes to economic development. This requires patience and introspection, but, unfortunately, neither of the two happens to be the forte of the government that is supposedly run by bhadralok Bengalis. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Sunanda K. Datta-Ray writes that Bengal desperately needs jobs that can only come from extensive manufacturing industries. There is nothing new in this advice. As far as Nandigram is concerned, the government needs to answer a couple of questions. First, is it necessary to grab farmers lands by force to industrialize a state? Why dont the Marxist leaders take lessons from the history of industrial development in Bengal? B.C. Roy, the former chief minister, is considered to be the primary architect of industrial development in the state. But Roy made use of only non-agricultural land in his bid to set up industries, thereby showing that one does not need to take over farmland by force to develop a state. An industry can come up anywhere on dry land, in arid areas, even on fallow patches. This cannot be said of agriculture, which requires fertile tracts. Only Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his acolytes seem not to have understood this so far. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Getting the facts correct

 Sir The article, The Rani General Files (March 27), by Ashok V. Desai contains some glaring inaccuracies. Suraiya did not emigrate to Pakistan. She never married, and she reportedly had an affair with Dev Anand, not Dilip Kumar. Suraiya died at the age of 75 in Mumbai in 2004. Noor Jehan, known as mallika-e-tarannum or the melody queen in Pakistan, was more or less a contemporary of Suraiya and was well-known as a singer-actress in Bombay around the same time. She migrated to Pakistan and reigned as the leading lady for a number of years. It is therefore not correct to say in the Sixties, emerged another actress who stole Pakistani hearts Noor Jehan. She was already established and famous well before that time.

 Yours faithfully,

G.M. Kapur, Calcutta

 Sir Dilip Kumar, probably the greatest living actor of Indian cinema, never got to be paired with Suraiya. Neither was she ever in love with Dilip Kumar, contrary to what Ashok V. Desai thinks. And Suraiya did not leave for Lahore in 1947. If she was in love with anybody, it was Dev Anand, but she did not marry him, although the reasons may never be known. She lived an isolated and secluded life and died a few years ago in Mumbai. For Desais further information, it was Noor Jehan who was paired with Dilip Kumar in the film Jugnu in 1947 which was directed by Noor Jehans former husband, Syed Shaukat Hussain Rizvi. And it was Noor Jehan who migrated to Pakistan in 1947, only to find that there was no established film industry in Pakistan to make use of her talent. Although it took her a few years, she did become Pakistans most popular singing-acting sensation finally. Therefore, the question of Suraiya breaking the heart of Dilip Kumar, as well as millions of Indian hearts, does not arise.

 Yours faithfully,

 Saghir Asad, Calcutta

 Sir Ashok V. Desai should refrain from writing about matters of which he has no knowledge. He needed to be informed that Suraiya did not make Pakistan her home nor was she ever married. She lived in India and acted in numerous Indian films Dillagi, Anmol Ghadi, Mirza Galib, Rustam Sohrab and so on and died unmarried a couple of years ago. Desai should have looked up the several obituaries of Suraiya that had appeared in most major newspapers in 2004.

 Yours faithfully,

 Farhat Khan, Calcutta

 The author regrets the errors.

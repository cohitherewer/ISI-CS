 FIELDS OF DISTRESS

 There are some firsts that are screaming advertisements of failure. When West Bengal does manage to get a first in the country, it is of this kind. It has beaten all states to excel in the number of suicides a year. The numbers are of 2005, but even in 2004, West Bengal was not too far behind the first and second states in suicide records: Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. It is pointless to ask whether the fact that 13,424 people had committed suicide in one year had worried anyone in the administration in 2004. If the administration did notice, its members must have merely felt a pang of pity for Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. West Bengal was better off. It is no wonder that West Bengal outran them all in the following year.

 To concentrate on the pure psychology of suicide as an impulsive act of extreme emotional distress in order to explain why 15,015 human beings killed themselves in 2005 is to duck the truth. No emotion arises out of the rootless depths of the soul. The horrifying count of suicides in closed tea gardens for the last 15 months points to a harsh truth. Similar counts for closed factories and mills would yield interesting results. In agriculture, under-production can be as lethal as over-production. Suicides among the potato farmers in Burdwan, for example, were a result of overproduction. The potatoes could be neither stored nor sold at reasonable prices. Nor is there always a direct relationship between apparent causes. The price of chemical fertilizers, bought from middlemen, with money borrowed at killing rates of interest from moneylenders, together destroys farmers when they produce too much for the infrastructure to accommodate. Inescapable socio-economic circumstances are exacerbated by powerful vested interests the government seems to have many reasons to leave moneylenders, middlemen and lobbyists for chemical fertilizers alone.

 The debt trap is a socio-economic phenomenon, just as starvation is. A man killed himself recently because he had mortgaged his crop to pay his daughters dowry hardly an emotion and his crop failed. A teenage girl killed herself because her siblings ate up the little rice the family had got after weeks when she had gone for a bath. Usually though, women cope better with issues of this sort. Their suicides usually have a direct sexual or marital cause. The number driven to suicide by domestic torture is enough to shame any state. Add to this the women who kill themselves out of shame, because they have been raped or sexually exploited. Is it possible to delink the number of suicides from dowry, rape and starvation? Or from the fact that West Bengal also heads the country in trafficking in women? The homeless widow who was trying to sell her baby daughters at Rs 3,000 each could stand as a symbol of all that the government has achieved for the poor so far.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SILENCE IS 

 NOT GOLDEN 

 Mala Fide

 Malvika Singh

 Soon 

 after the shameful M.F. Husain saga, we have been staggered 

 by the madness of a bunch of people who had the gall to 

 trespass, attack and vandalize property that did not belong 

 to them. For this they were celebrated instead of being 

 severely punished. The tragedy is that the people who were 

 attacked and assaulted were arrested by the police, and 

 the ones who had indulged openly in the illegal action went 

 scot-free. How can the authorities mandated to enforce law 

 and order get away without being made accountable and duly 

 punished? Something has gone radically wrong in our country. 

 No one in the seat of power, no national leader has risen 

 to denounce this particular action, and endless other similar 

 acts, that breach the freedoms enshrined in our Constitution. 

 Yet, these freedoms must be actively defended and protected 

 by the political and civil administration of India if we 

 are to remain civilized.

 Where are the great jurists? Where 

 are our cabinet ministers? Where are the senior secretaries 

 to the government of India? Why this ominous silence? Does 

 this silence stem from a sense of fear? Does it symbolize 

 an acceptance of the action? Or, is it a its-not-my-department 

 syndrome? If the child of a minister, prime minister or 

 president had been a victim of this vandalism, would the 

 response have been more forthright and damning? Would the 

 guilty have been arrested? Would the attackers have 

 gotten away? Are we all losing the plot? Are we abdicating 

 our responsibility, integrity and dignity by allowing the 

 public domain to be usurped by a parallel, illegal force 

 that does what it pleases?

 Forced occupation

 With the corrupt having overwhelmed 

 and contaminated our polity, to watch the lower courts function 

 in peculiar ways, as in the case of the Richard Gere/Shilpa 

 Shetty incident and the M.F. Husain case, is frightening. 

 Many questions arise. Are we on the verge of slipping backwards 

 in time? Are we permitting reactionary and polarized groups 

 who operate at the fringes of civil society to occupy the 

 liberal space of our multicultural, plural and modern democracy? 

 And if so, why are we succumbing to such pressures? 

 Yes, these are troubling questions 

 that seem to have no sane answers. Where then do we pin 

 down the responsibility for this breakdown? Fortunately, 

 there are two appeals before a final judgment. But in the 

 process, the lives of innocent professionals are destroyed, 

 emotions damaged, and futures blurred.

 Imagine, for a moment, that the 

 Supreme Court unanimously decrees that all Indians must 

 become vegetarians! It would require a two-third majority 

 vote in parliament to overturn that law. Absurd as this 

 may sound, there are countless issues that the court could 

 rule on, primarily because the executive has ceased to govern 

 as it should, which could damage our democracy, leading 

 us into the dark depths of anarchy. 

 The judiciary is the last straw. 

 If it dilutes its sacrosanct role by cloning the many essential 

 institutions of governance and the pillars of our democracy 

 that have, in recent times, degraded themselves by operating 

 outside the confines of the laws and freedoms the judiciary 

 is mandated to protect and enforce, India will witness a 

 terrible revolt. Growth will cease, partnerships will end, 

 polarization will lead to bloodshed. Surely, our leaders 

 can see the regressive writing on the wall. Why then this 

 unbecoming silence?

 The good news was Mayavatis victory. 

 Her romping home to power without being seen on any television 

 channel proved beyond doubt that political reportage on 

 the little box has been much too superficial. Mayavati happens 

 to be a Dalit with an all-caste support. She has won and 

 occupied the plural ground that once belonged to the Indian 

 National Congress. Will the Congress reclaim that political 

 space?

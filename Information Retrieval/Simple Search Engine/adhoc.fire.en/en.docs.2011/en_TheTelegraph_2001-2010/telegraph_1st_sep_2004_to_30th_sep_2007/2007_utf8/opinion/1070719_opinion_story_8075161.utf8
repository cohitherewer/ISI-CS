 HARDLY A FORCE 

 TO RECKON WITH 

 - What does it take to catch a few street hooligans? 

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 July 15, Sunday, was when Jagannath 

 De, a 22-year-old hotel management student, was mercilessly 

 beaten up by six hoodlums when he tried to stop them from 

 harassing a young girl in a state transport bus. Till Tuesday, 

 July 17, Calcuttas police had made no breakthrough in 

 tracking down the six youths. And all because the girl 

 in question has not yet spoken up.

 How credible is this? Of course, 

 it will be of great help if the girl came forward, but for 

 the media they will get some more gory details rather 

 than for the police. What if the girl says she cannot identify 

 the miscreants? After all, she must have been trying to 

 look the other way and ignore their advances inside the 

 bus. Jagannath and his companion, Subhendu Roy, who first 

 had a verbal and then a physical exchange with them, stand 

 a far better chance of identifying the culprits.

 And yet, we are told repeatedly 

 that if only the girl came forward, the hooligans would 

 be put behind bars in no time. If the girl is one hurdle, 

 the other, apparently, is the law, since the accused in 

 such cases mostly get bail. It probably escaped the police 

 bosses when they said this that people need to be caught 

 first for them to get bail.

 And this is where the police seem 

 to have run into a dead end. But could the tracking of the 

 six men be so nerve-wrackingly difficult? One can think 

 of quite a few ways of zeroing in on them. After waiting 

 for two days, I think that the police need to be told about 

 these so that they can make some headway. 

 From what we know so far, the 

 conductor of the S9 bus played an active role, along with 

 at least two middle-aged male passengers, in pushing Jagannath 

 out of the vehicle on the E.M. Bypass. If the police are 

 to be believed, then all the drivers and conductors interviewed 

 have claimed that there was no untoward incident on the 

 buses that they were managing on July 15. But Jagannath 

 has already said that he boarded the bus at around 5.30 

 pm from the Karunamoyee stop. Surely there couldnt have 

 been a dozen S9 buses stopping at Karunamoyee around 5.30 

 on July 15? And from the approximate time it takes an S9 

 bus to reach Karunamoyee from its originating terminus, 

 it cannot be difficult to find out which vehicle provided 

 the stage for the unfortunate incident. And given that log-books 

 are maintained at state transport depots, the driver and 

 conductor of that particular bus can be easily identified. 

 The conductor, having intervened and thrown out Jagannath 

 and the six hooligans from his bus, should be able to remember 

 their features more clearly than the bullied girl can be 

 expected to.

 Since a few passengers were very 

 eager to purge the bus of Jagannath and his friend (also 

 the miscreants) strange, since the two boys were fighting 

 for a cause these gentlemen may be willing to give a different 

 account of the incident. The police do not seem to have 

 looked hard enough for them either.

 But most important, they do not 

 seem interested in tapping the most important witness, and 

 one who is willing to help the police in identifying the 

 miscreants that is, Jagannath. On July 16, the brave young 

 man, in a delicate state of health, was summoned to the 

 police headquarters the cops could easily have gone to 

 him and his statement recorded. Since then, the police 

 have prepared a few sketches, all the while cursing the 

 girl for not having the courage to speak up. 

 The same police force has also 

 failed to produce conclusive evidence against the gangster-criminal, 

 Tapas Das (Bulton), and let him get away scot-free. Is it 

 mere incompetence, or is there a pattern?

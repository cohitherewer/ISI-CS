 RHYTHM IN RAINDROPS

 Sreyashi Dastidar

 Music

 On August 6, the birthday of the untimely-departed Roma Mondal, Roma Ramyabina put together a programme at Uttam Mancha, around the rhythmic versatility of Tagore, the composer. Before the singers and musicians came on stage, there was a small ceremony in memory of the late singer. The best part of it were the two songs from one of her live performances, and the worst the useless though implied exchange between a singer and a mentor over the insincere and wily nature of the current crop of Rabindrasangeet singers. 

 Although it began on this slightly awkward note, the evening had a number of good performances to offer. Under the guidance of Biplab Mondal and Pramita Mallick, the students Roma Mondal had groomed tried to do justice to their training. Although the conceptualization of the programme had the feel of a diploma-course curriculum of Rabindrasangeet, it nonetheless drew attention to the genius of the man who, at the same time that he was writing, painting, travelling and teaching, was also experimenting with the received rhythmic patterns of Hindustani classical music and creating ones of his own. 

 Jete jete ekla pathey, the first (choral) song of the evening, happened to be in jhampak, a taal created by Tagore (its two divisions with the galloping 3/2 beats explain the name). Nibiro ghana andhare was performed in a rather slow tempo, as if to convey the full impact of the Tagorean nabataal. Chitrita Ganguly and Somnath Raychaudhuri coordinated well with each other in Keno sharadin dheerey dheerey, set in rupakda (with 3/2/3 divisions), yet another Tagore creation. Chitrita also sang Nibiro megher chhayay mon diyechhi mele (set in shashthi taal, with 2/4 divisions) and Rajanir shesh tara in kaharba. Though she had problems holding her breath in the latter, her pleasant, well-modulated voice and nuanced singing held much promise. Anwesha Sen (Chokkhe amar trishna, ardha-jhanptaal) had arguably the most unusual voice of the lot, with a dry, grainy quality that suited the song to a T. Koyel Adhikaris bold throwing was adequate for Himagiri phele neechey neme ele, but she must pay more attention to the lower octave. 

 Sreedhara Guptas command over the notes was evident in Rakho rakho re jibane (teentaal) and in Megh bolechhe jabo jabo which she sang with Aveek Kumar Mallick. Aveek got four songs and his sincere efforts notwithstanding, he needs some more time to mature. Of the three songs sung by trios, Janani tomar karun charankhani (Sanjukta Ray, Sanjukta Das and Alakananda Ghosh) was well-executed, while Duare dao more rakhiya (Suparna Majumdar, Alakananda Ghosh and Chandrabali Bhattacharya) suffered from weak singing and a lack of coordination. 

 The second, shorter section was for Mohan Singh (picture, right), who stayed committed to Tagores meditative, melancholy and inward-looking songs, such as Ashim kaalsagarey, Andhar sakali dekhi tomare dekhi na jabe and Natha hey, prempathey shob badha. But his most moving performances of the evening were Kakhan je basanta gelo (the first song composed by Tagore after Kadambari Debis suicide) and the akhar-embellished, keertan-anga Ohey jibanballabha. 

 The mood of the monsoons presided over Bhowanipore Baikali Associations programme at Sisir Mancha on August 13 (picture, left). The role of Pramita Mallick, whose students did all the singing, was confined to stringing the songs through a narrative. The singing group comprised Aniruddha (Sasha) Ghoshal, Debisree Dutta, Maitreyee Bandopadhyay, Shuma Saha, Sounak Chattopadhyay and Srinwanti Dutta. Each of the six are gifted singers, but, with the exception of Debisree, Sounak and Aniruddha, none could realize their full potentials. And even with an enviable vocal range, Aniruddha appeared to have overreached his grasp in prefixing his songs with a quick alaap and bandish. Sounak, though, sang Andhare ambare prachanda dambaru as competently as he elaborated the ragas Megh and Gour Malhar. Maitreyees problems were the microphone and hitting the first note of a song correctly (Chokkhe amar trishna, Keno pantha e chanchalata). Srinwantis singing was unsteady at best, with inaudible base notes, but perhaps the occasion had overwhelmed her. Shuma sang with more confidence, capturing well the drama of Amar Nishith raater badaldhara and the pathos of Asrubhara bedana. 

 But Debisree was a picture of tranquillity and sang with an understated perfection that made up for the shortcomings of the rest. Her Aj akasher moner kotha, Aji tomay abar and Megher pore megh jomechhe were like excellent soliloquies, and Meghachhaye sajalbaye had the right tinge of rainy-day blues. 

 Debanjan Bhattacharyas sarod deserved the importance it got a welcome change from playing along with songs and filling up empty spaces. But it was Shubhayu Sen Majumdar on the esraj who, with his exquisite and nuanced pieces (particularly in Sakhi andhare, Asrubhara bedana and Aj akasher moner kotha), showed just how much can be done with preludes and interludes without either straying into the garish or upsetting the conservative Tagoreans who would have accompanists stick to strictly echoing first lines.

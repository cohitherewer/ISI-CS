 WEAPONS WITHOUT TEETH

 Fifth Column - N.K. Pant

 The successful launch of the Agni III missile is being seen by many as a feather on the cap of the Defence Research and Development Organisation. However, the DRDOs overall performance in this project has been uninspiring, to say the least. During first test firing of this 3000-km-range missile in July last year, the nuclear warhead carrier crashed into the sea after developing a technical snag. Moreover, it may take another decade before this powerful intermediate range ballistic missile is made available to the armed forces for deployment. Hence, the DRDOs post-launch claim that the country has now achieved a major milestone in missile technology sounds a bit too optimistic. 

 This is not all. According to reports, the worlds leading aircraft manufacturing companies have started courting New Delhi as the government is expected to place a multi-billion-dollar order for the acquisition of multi-role combat planes to replace the Indian Air Forces ageing fleet. Had Indias defence research organization possessed the requisite capabilities to develop and deliver modern weaponry to our armed forces, it would have saved the government from entering into such a costly and time-consuming bureaucratic exercise.

 In this contest, one needs to mention a report that was submitted by a parliamentary standing committee in March. The report stated that the time and cost overruns associated with projects undertaken by the DRDO have been responsible for the delay in military modernization. For instance, the development of the Kaveri engine for the Light Combat Aircraft was sanctioned way back in 1989 with an outlay of Rs 283 crore. The DRDO was to complete the prestigious project in 1996 but it was extended to 2009 with a revised budget of Rs 2,839 crore. Some other crucial projects, such as the airborne surveillance platform, were also abandoned after spending large sums of money.

 Joining forces

 The DRDO was formed in 1958 by amalgamating various splinter directorates functioning in the sphere of defence science, technical development and production. It was then a compact organization with only ten laboratories. Over the years, the DRDO has seen phenomenal growth, having transformed itself into a large organization with 50 laboratories that are manned by more than 5000 scientists and nearly 25,000 support staff. 

 The defence research bodys vision was to make the nation independent of foreign technology in critical spheres. Unfortunately, it has become a techno-bureaucratic trap, stifling inventiveness and placing obstacles on the path of achieving its coveted goals. This has resulted in India increasing its arms purchase, making New Delhi one of the worlds leading buyers of arms.

 Presently, the DRDO has its hands full with projects to develop missiles, armament, the LCA, radars, electronic warfare system and so on. The few successes notwithstanding, most of the other programmes are running behind schedule. Some, like the indigenously developed Main Battle Tank, Arjun, fell short of the expectations of the military personnel.The military establishment decided to acquire the T-90 battle tanks from Russia. 

 If the DRDO has failed to meet targets by itself, it must enter into collaborations with foreign firms. The BrahMos, a cruise missile designed with the help of a team of Russians, is a step in the right direction. Moreover, there exists a large pool of scientific talent in Indian universities and technological institutes and the DRDO must make use of this while outsourcing defence projects. 

 The parliaments standing committee on defence rightly wants the government to appoint an independent panel for an appraisal of the DRDOs present organizational set up and functions. This may help it deliver the goods in the sphere of defence technology.

 MIND THE GAFFE

 GWYNNE DYER

 For over two years, all the big Western powers have insisted that Irans nuclear power programme is secretly intended to produce nuclear weapons, that the minute it gets them, it will launch them at Israel. But recently, the French president, Jacques Chirac, said something very different. I would say that what is dangerous about this situation is not the fact of [Iran] having a nuclear bomb, Chirac said in reply to a journalists question during an interview that was originally meant to be about climate change. [Iran] having one [bomb], or perhaps a second bomb a little later, well, thats not very dangerous.

 Where will [Iran] drop it, this bomb? Chirac asked scornfully. On Israel? [The missile] would not have gone 200 metres into the air before Tehran would be razed to the ground. He spoke as if deterrence would work even against Iran. As if the country were run by sane human beings who dont want their children to be burned, crushed and vaporized by Israeli and American nuclear weapons. Hes not supposed to talk like that in public.

 In Chiracs view, the danger is not that Iran would be irresponsible with its nuclear weapons, but that they would lead to a general proliferation of such weapons in the Middle East. Why wouldnt Saudi Arabia do it? he asked. Why wouldnt it help Egypt to do it as well? That is the real danger. But hes not supposed to say that either. Those are the Wests allies, the very countries that the United States of America is currently trying to mobilize as the leaders of an anti-Iranian alliance of Sunni-Arab countries. Chirac was simply stating the truth as he sees it, but his comments completely undermined the joint Western position, so the following day he was forced to retract them. He still didnt say that he was wrong, however, just that he had thought he was off the record when discussing Iran, as the interview was originally about climate change.

 Fear factor

 France is clearly worried by the drumbeat of anti-Iranian propaganda in Washington, which sounds alarmingly similar to the campaign of misinformation waged by the Bush administration before it attacked Iraq. Last month, Chirac was forced to cancel a planned visit to Tehran by the French foreign minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, because his allies did not trust France to stick to the party line. They were right in their suspicions but France is right, too. France is right to argue that Iranian nuclear weapons, if they existed, would be primarily defensive in nature and would not be used to attack Israel, because nuclear deterrence still works, and Iranians do not want their country to commit suicide. It is also right to worry that an Iranian bomb would create pressures for further proliferation. 

 France is utterly hypocritical in worrying about Middle-Eastern countries owning nuclear weapons when it has had them itself for a long time. And it is jumping to conclusions when it assumes that Irans stated (and quite legal) desire to enrich uranium for nuclear power generation conceals a drive to get an actual nuclear weapon as soon as possible.

 The truth may be that Iran is, for the moment, seeking a threshold nuclear weapons capacity: a level of technological expertise from which it could, in an emergency, develop actual nuclear weapons in about six months. Such a position is entirely legal, and some 40 countries currently occupy it. 

 The truth may also be that the nuclear-armed neighbour Iran really worries about is not Israel but Pakistan, whose 1998 nuclear tests scared Iranian strategists half to death. They dont worry about the intentions of General Pervez Musharraf, but they know that his is a one-bullet regime. Rather, they worry about what kind of fanatics might succeed him.

 So maybe, Chiracs gaffe was not as accidental as it seemed. Maybe he wanted people to re-examine all the lies and half-truths we are told about Iran, as Washington seems to be gearing up for another attack. And maybe we should.

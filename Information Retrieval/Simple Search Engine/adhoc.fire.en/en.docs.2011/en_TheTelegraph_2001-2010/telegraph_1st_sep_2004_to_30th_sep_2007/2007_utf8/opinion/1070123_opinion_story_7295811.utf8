 CITY BLIGHTS

 Indias most renowned cybercity seems to be continually fighting over the dead. Only last year, inconsolable fans of filmstar and cultural icon, Rajkumar, turned violent while imposing a state of mourning and brought Bangalore to a standstill for days. Two more departed souls have sparked off mass fury in the city. They are Saddam Hussein, who is fast turning into a crowd- puller to the delight of politicians in both north and south India, and M.S. Golwalkar, whose utility to politicians of the saffron variety can never be fully assessed. While a meeting to condemn the death of the Iraqi dictator provided the occasion for the outbreak of violence in Bangalore, another to commemorate the birth centenary of the Maratha stalwart gave troublemakers the opportunity to intensify the unrest. The mob not only ransacked property, but also turned against the law-enforcers themselves. As during the Gujarat riots and the more recent violence in Mumbai, the marauders quiet confidence in gaining the sympathy of the ruling government appears to have encouraged them into perpetrating greater cruelty. Their belief may not be entirely misplaced either. If the state government, a Janata Dal (S) and Bharatiya Janata Party combine, had been committed to maintaining law and order, it is doubtful if there would have been such a sudden spurt of communal violence in the state. The BJPs rise to power and its mobilization, based on temple politics and the imposition of the ban on cow-slaughter, have further polarized Karnataka. Sharpening conflicts in coastal areas of the state are evidence of this trend.

 The fallout of such divisive politics, dangerous as it is, is bound to have a more devastating effect in a city that finds itself torn by conflicting emotions caused by unequal economic growth. The heightened regional chauvinism, spiralling crime rates and the increase in urban poverty are all results of this discriminatory development. The politics of opportunism practised by Karnatakas leaders, quite evidently, does nothing to help matters.

 FUSING BODY AND SOUL

 Dance

 On March 31 and April 8, lovers of Indian classical dance and music in Calcutta saw a wonderful festival organized by Kalamandalam, Calcutta. The programmes were held at Madhusudan Manch and Rabindra Sadan. Kalamandalam dedicated the programme to the late Govindan Kutty. The festival gave as much importance to the various dance forms from the south as to those from east and north India. 

 The inaugural programme kicked off with Jayeeta Banerjees Bharatnatyam recital. Her first offering, Ganesha Keertanam, was set in raga Hansadhwani and taalam adi. The song was composed by M. Balamurali Krishna. In this mythological tale, the devotee prays to Ganesha to bless her with eternal happiness. The dancers smiling countenance, excellent execution of the rhythmic permutations and admirable gait enhanced the performance. The keertanam was followed by Dakshinamurthy, in praise of Shiva.

 The two presentations in Bharatnatyam were followed by Mohiniyattam by Chandreyee Basu Thakur. This dance form from Kerala portrays feminine love in its many forms carnal, devotional and maternal, with the accent more on lasya and bhava. The language of the lyrics, called Manipravalam, is a pleasant mixture of Malayalam and Sanskrit. Basu Thakur staged Sri Ganapati Tuyilunam ( Wake up, Oh! Ganesha). When Parvati goes for a bath, she leaves her elephant-headed son behind at home to keep a watch on her unfaithful husband, Shiva. But Shiva manages to keep Ganesha away from him, and Parvati returns to see her husband enjoying the company of Ganga. Gifted with an attractive demeanour, eminently suited for Mohiniyattam, Basu Thakur gave a sparkling recital. The contrasting emotions were perfectly executed by the dancer.

 Arpita Sen staged Madhurashtakam, set to Ragamalika and taalam adi. Despite Thankamani Kuttys wonderful choreography, Sen somehow failed to leave any impression on the minds of her audience.

 Under the tutelage of Thankamani Kutty, Malabika Sen (picture) has gained expertise in both Bharatnatyam and Kuchipudi.The first day of the festival concluded with her Kuchipudi recital. Kuchipudi originated in Andhra Pradesh.The lyrics are usually in Telugu though Sanskrit verses are also not uncommon. Earlier, this dance style was not a solo affair. It required a number of performers. Today Kuchipudi is considerably different from what it once used to be. In most of cases, it is performed solo by female dancers. Kauthuvam is performed in praise of Ganesha in front of the dhwaja stambha of a temple on the commencement of a festival. Sen performed with a lot of gusto. The extravagant body movements and exaggerated facial expressions were part theatre, part dance.

 The second day was mainly composed of Sens Bharatnatyam. She began with a keertanam, followed by a varnam and tillana. She was graceful in each of the presentations. Her control over her nritya was evident.

 Enakshi Das, an Odissi dancer and a disciple of Kelucharan Mahapatra, took over from Sen with a Shivastuti. She presented three numbers. Her supple body movements blended with dexterous footwork to make her performance evocative. The contrasting emotions her face delineated were eloquent enough to demonstrate her virtuosity in abhinaya.

 Kirti Ramgopal, a student of Padmini Ramachandran, is a promising artiste. The classic beauty of Odissi found a new expression in her body language, the balance of verve and grace adding an extra dimension.

 The two-day festival concluded with the performance of Sadanand Biswas, a Kathak dancer from Delhi. He is a disciple of Rajendra Kumar Gangani. His presentation began with the usual guruvandana. The taal was beautifully intercepted through the laaya or tempo. The evening culminated in the dancers rendering of a Kabir bhajan. Here he transcended the ornate court conventions of the Kathak style and entered the very dynamism of life itself.

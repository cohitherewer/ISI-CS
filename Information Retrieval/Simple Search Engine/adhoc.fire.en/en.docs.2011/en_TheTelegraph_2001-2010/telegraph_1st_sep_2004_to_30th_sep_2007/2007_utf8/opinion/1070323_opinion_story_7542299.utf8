 A TIME OF QUIET DESPERATION

 Poor stock

 March-end marks the end of the financial year. For Indian publishers, this is the last opportunity to clear stock that has accumulated over time to libraries that are as keen to exhaust their budgets in case they are penalized for non-utilization. There is, then, an air of quiet desperation all around: publishers want to maximize sales because what happens in March determines their future plans; libraries too try and spend their budgets by any means. So, in the hurly-burly, anything goes: cart-loads of books are taken physically for on-the-spot selection.

 But this practice raises a few questions. Why is the selection of books done in the last minute? Can anything be done to change the system to spread out the acquisition of books over the whole year? How does the selection process affect the consumer for whom the library has been created?

 Most of the problems of last-minute selection arise because of the ineptitude of those who run the system: teachers and librarians in the case of educational institutions; elsewhere, in public libraries, the library committee, which also includes the librarian.

 In both cases, the selection is done by a committee, never by a librarian or an academic. Committee decisions always take time because of conflicting priorities that are exacerbated by a perennial shortage of funds. So decisions on what to select or reject get postponed till March comes around. Publishers and distributors should also take the rap for the mess in library selections. They often fail to stock the kind of books their clients are looking for. Of course, it is quite impossible to cater to the sundry demands of niche markets, but no publisher can afford to do so indefinitely. 

 So what happens is that the distributor places orders only against firm orders or gets fast-moving titles that can be turned around in a couple of months. Academics looking for serious literature should consider themselves lucky if they get hold of even a fraction of their reading lists.

 March comes with the shopping basket empty. The readers fill it up mainly through forced substitutions. What also needs to be stressed is that it is not just a question of adequate funding. If selections are made judiciously, there will be enough for everyone. Can this be changed and the rigidities of the committee system softened somewhat? Should the librarian be given greater powers? This is unlikely because the librarian and the academic often do not trust each other. So, the status quo will remain, until something drastic takes place.

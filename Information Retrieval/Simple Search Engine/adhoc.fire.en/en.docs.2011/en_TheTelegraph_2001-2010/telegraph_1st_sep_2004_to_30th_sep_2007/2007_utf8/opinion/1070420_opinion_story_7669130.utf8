 ITS SO EASY

 The Virginia Tech killer owned two legally-purchased guns. The state he studied in is one of the easiest places in the United States of America for buying guns. The window-dressing at the gun-shop, which sold the 23-year-old student one of his weapons, is a huge portrait of Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden has two guns pointing at him and a target imposed over his head. Gun-owners are defending not only themselves, but also their nation. The right to bear arms is therefore fundamental to establishment notions of citizenship and liberty. A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, says the Bill of Rights in the Second Amendment to the American Constitution, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. The killer, in this case, is far from well-regulated. His academic work, together with the confessional videotapes he made between his killing sprees and mailed to a news channel, shows clear signs of derangement expressed in violent abusive terms. Yet access to guns was the least of his problems. The Columbine High School killers were minors and could not buy their own guns. They got an adult friend to acquire the weapons for them from a gun show, where background checks are not conducted.

 Republicans have traditionally been against any kind of gun control, continuing and politically endorsing an ethos that goes back, through the Civil War, to the War of Independence. A hangover from the frontier culture also feeds into this history. Powerful gun lobbies like the National Rifle Association and the electoral system hold the political leadership in hostage. Two arguments are doing the rounds, post-Blacksburg. First, it is in bad taste to politicize the tragedy by using it to push for gun-control reforms. Second, had the campus not been made a gun-free zone by law, the students would have been carrying their own weapons and would thus have been able to defend themselves. Both Britain, after the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, and Australia, following the shootings in Tasmania in the same year, had immediately sought to restrict access to guns. But most leaders, including the president, are being guarded on this issue. Meanwhile, it is still easy, in America, to have a gun in your pocket even if you are not at all pleased to see anybody.

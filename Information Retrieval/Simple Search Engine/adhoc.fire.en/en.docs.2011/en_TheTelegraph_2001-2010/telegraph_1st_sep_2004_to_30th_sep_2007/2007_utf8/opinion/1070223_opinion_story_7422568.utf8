 Helping hand

 Hand in hand

Sir Ashok Ganguly in An end to poverty (Feb 14), does a great service by recalling Mohammad Yunuss hypothesis about the reasons behind lending institutions incapability to service the poor. Yunuss Grameen Bank fills the lacunae. Under its self-help-group system, individuals are assembled into a team and are given loans to undertake remunerative businesses of their choice. Most of these loans are essentially meant for acquiring basic raw materials. No further loan is granted in case of a default. 

 It is this joint liability that contributes to a fascinating loan recovery rate of 99 per cent unheard of event in conventional banking. Yunus has also intelligently used women as his mainstay to spread the credit network. He persuaded them to use the opportunity to improve their lives on a sustainable basis. Unlike conventional banks, the Grameen Bank looks at the latent potential of an individual rather than his or her material assets. Further, Yunuss bank never subjects its borrowers to external pressure to recover the loans. Therefore, the whole concept of lending money has helped create a vast social network to empower the poor. Yunus has indeed found light shining at the end of the poverty tunnel. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sohail Md, Calcutta

 Sir While talking about poverty, Ashok Ganguly says, It exists for the benefit of those who succeed and prosper in society and is therefore a product of vested interests. Would he care to explain how the successful people of, say, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden or Japan have managed to do without poverty-stricken people and still flourish? No country can prosper by impoverishing its people. Later in the article, Ganguly rephrases one of Mohammed Yunuss comment made in a lecture in Mumbai and says that Every human being is born with equal abilities. I beg to disagree. Each man is born unequal where intelligence and capability are concerned. In a classroom, all students are taught from the same books by the same teachers, and during the examinations, students of a class are asked the same questions. Yet some score high marks while some fail to qualify. The chief reason for poverty is mans innate inequality. How else can one explain the stupendous progress made by some people and the failure of others to advance? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir Mohammad Yunuss micro-credit theory, its practical application through the Grameen Bank and its revolutionary results are put in the right perspective by Ashok Ganguly. Ganguly alludes to the possibility of putting in place a similar system in India to alleviate poverty. However, one doubts if India will have a committed individual like Yunus to assure the success of such a scheme here.

 Yours faithfully,

 Welcome move

 Sir The decision of the University of Calcutta to treat all students on a par during admission for undergraduate courses is a welcome relief for those taking examinations conducted by the Indian School Certificate and the Central Board of Secondary Education (Varsity parity for all students, Feb 17). The state colleges and universities have long discriminated against pupils of other boards. The recent introduction of the grade system for higher secondary students will help bring parity among all boards. Perhaps the council realized that its own stinginess with marks is telling negatively on its students as well as those from other boards. The university should have a common test for college admission. Minimal importance should be ascribed to the marks acquired in the board examinations.

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Gupta, Hooghly 

 Sir It is heartening to note that students of the central boards will no longer have to submit a migration certificate during the time of admission to colleges affiliated to the Calcutta University. Such a measure should have been adopted long ago. This will save students undue delay and harassment. The benefit should be extended to students from any other board anywhere in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rita Sinha, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir From the report, From CPM, with love (Feb 20), it appears that the senior leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have at last realized that hooliganism does not help. Hence the recourse to Gandhigiri. The party has been criticizing Mamata Banerjee without trying to address the basic cause of her recurrent agitations. One hopes that the flowers will soften Banerjees heart and she will agree to sit and iron out her differences with the chief minister.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

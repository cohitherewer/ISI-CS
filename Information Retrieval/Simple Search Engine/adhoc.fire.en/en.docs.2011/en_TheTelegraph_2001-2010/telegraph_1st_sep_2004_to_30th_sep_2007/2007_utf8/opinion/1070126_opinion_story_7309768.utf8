The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RICH AND POOR

 There is a distinction, not often recognized, between a poor nation and a nation of poor people. The distinction is not otiose, on the contrary it is a significant one. On Republic Day, the 57th one, it can be said that with economic growth hovering close to the double-digit mark, India is no longer a poor nation. The stranglehold of the Hindu rate of growth has been decisively broken, and a proud republic can now proclaim its pride without any shame to pull it back. Yet this achievement cannot take away from the fact that there are many poor people in India today. They are poor not in relative terms but in absolute terms. So the biggest challenge before a robust and a proud republic is the accomplishment of prosperity with the uplift of those who are poor. Growth with equity may be an elusive ideal but in a country like India it is the only one worth striving for.

 The most convenient definition of poverty is the one that links it to the absence of the basic amenities of life food, shelter, education and health. It is possible to expand this definition to include the world of emotions and the intellect. It is here that the contrast between wealth and poverty presents a paradox in India. There are people in India who are rich in the material sense of the word and have access to more than the basic amenities, but they display an appalling emotional and intellectual impoverishment. This poverty is manifest in their immaturity. One recent example of this is the extreme prickliness that was voiced by many affluent and educated Indians when an Indian actress was racially abused by a participant in a silly television show in Britain. It did not strike such people that to a proud and self-confident nation, as well as to its citizens, such comments should be irrelevant and treated as beneath contempt. There are many such instances when Indians have needlessly got hot under their collars because they felt their country had been slighted. Such reactions ill befit a republic poised to enter the select enclave of the most powerful nations in the world.

 Nobody any longer sees India as a third-world country. The size of Indias market, its potential as a destination for investment, the role it plays in a world threatened by terror and the responsibility it has shown as a nuclear power have all made India abandon the image of a poor third-world nation and turn into a competitor for a place among the nations belonging to the so-called first world. India has shown that the boundaries separating nations into the first, second and third worlds are easily transgressed. This year, when at the end of the ceremonies designed to mark the end of the Republic Day celebrations the bells chime to the tune of Abide with Me, the retreat should be sounded for poverty. Only then will the republics flag flutter in pride.

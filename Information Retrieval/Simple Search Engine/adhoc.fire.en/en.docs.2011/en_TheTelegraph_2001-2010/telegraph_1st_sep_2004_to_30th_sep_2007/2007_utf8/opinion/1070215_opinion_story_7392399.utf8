 VISITORS AT THE DOOR

 Foreign Affairs -JYOTI MALHOTRA

 The world is coming to India this week, and so is the Italian prime minister, Romano Prodi, whose country clearly occupies a special place in Indias heart. We are, of course, talking about Sonia Gandhi here, whose journey from home to hearth, from Orbassano to New Delhi, is worthy of a Grecian story. However, its one thing for Indians to continue to obsess about Sonia and her family, and quite another for visiting Romans to get a rise out of her in Italian.

 So when Prodi, in Calcutta a few days ago, was quoted as saying that Sonia Gandhi is Indian, not Italian, a minor wave of irritation ran across the Congress party. And if you thought the Congress was over-reacting to a simple-enough remark, hear this. When the Italian deputy prime minister, Francesco Rutelli, met Sonia during the satyagraha conference in Delhi earlier in January, he tried his best to get her into the convivial, hum-sab-Italian-hain mode and speak the language. But Sonia, who knew better, simply refused to oblige. The frustrated gentleman, waving his arms expansively as he rose to leave, remarked, Not even two words! The lady pursed her lips, smiled vaguely and said pointedly, in English, Goodbye.

 Meet the president

 The hectic pace of life in the South Block never ceases, but last week clearly belonged to 50 Saudi girls who met the president in Rashtrapati Bhawan. Now, it may be that the Saudis are seeking to portray that their women are modern in their own way. More and more, they seem to be wanting to tell the world that the hijab is an integral part of Saudi culture, and beneath it lie both beauty and brains. 

 Still, this is not a debate about the virtues or demerits of Saudi patriarchy. This is a story about 50 spunky Saudi girls, in the age group of 18-21, who spent quality time with the Prez last week. What do you fear the most? one asked, while another followed up with what do you hope about? Kalam answered every question with utmost gravity, telling them about the time when he was in charge of Indias missile programme and the first rocket they sent up failed. He took responsibility. When the second mission succeeded, he gave all the credit to space hero, Satish Dhawan. Mark of a leader, he told the Saudi girls, was to take personal responsibility for failure, but share the credit for success.

 Leading the way

 Nitish Kumar may yet go down in the history of Bihar as a benevolent ruler, who, at least for the time being, is managing to keep all those money-making human wolves at bay, while he dispenses both justice and development with an iron hand. And since luck also favours the bold and the imaginative, Nitishs good karma was given a boost or two by none other than the visiting Chinese foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, on Monday. You see, Comrade Li had flown in straight from Beijing to Patna late at night, braving storm and wind, taking the route that Hieun Tsang had taken via road, of course in the 7th century AD, to the famous Nalanda university. He lived here for six years and took Buddhism back with him to China. 

 The modern Chinaman, meanwhile, who had just finished a 15-day gruelling trip to Africa before his Indian journey, thought nothing of waking up Monday morning and flying to Nalanda. But the journey back to Patna was by road, albeit in a Mercedes Benz, since Comrade Li wanted to see the Nalanda ruins and Rajgir.

 It seems that the Bihar bureaucracy has not stopped buzzing since. Just look at the Chinese foreign minister, he actually went by road! If you ask an Indian foreign minister to travel by road, he would turn his nose up at the thought. But the Chinese, Patna cant stop saying, so powerful and successful, simply continue to show us the way.

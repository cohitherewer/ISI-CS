The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AT OTHERS COST

 The prime minister does not generally waste words. He tries to say something significant even if it is a ceremonial speech as on Independence Day. Although few people go to listen to him at Red Fort, he does not pack them off with a 15-minute speech. This year he spoke for nearly 45 minutes, and gave some new messages. He claimed that his government has tripled expenditure on education and doubled expenditure on health, agriculture and rural development. These increases are far ahead of inflation, and signify a considerable increase in real expenditure. They do not signify equally large increases in total expenditure. For the social sectors are primarily the responsibility of states, and the Centre only supplements the resources that the states put into them. The prime minister appealed to the states to do more in a number of fields, such as education and power. And as the finance minister, P. Chidambaram, would ask: all this expenditure is fine, but what was the outcome? How many more teachers and doctors have been employed? How many turn up at work? How many just put up their feet on their tables and knit? But the prime minister is quite proud of what he has done, and maybe he has some cause to be. 

 Less admirable was his boast that his government had substantially raised support prices for wheat and rice. This is only money from the consumers pocket into the farmers. That may be good politics; maybe the prime minister thinks that the farmer is more likely to vote for his party than the urban consumer. Besides, the money is given out only by Food Corporation of India, and thus nourishes all the corruption that this government enterprise sponsors. The foodgrains would have reached the consumer even if the government had done nothing. If the government had not supported prices of wheat and rice, the secondary grains jowar, bajra, ragi and others which enriched our cuisine sixty years ago would not have died out. 

 Mr Chidambaram had promised three years ago to double credit supply to farmers; the prime minister announced that the government has done it. He did not refer to the farmers who killed themselves, but announced that loans to farmers had been written off. Write-offs turn loans into gifts; if they knew loans would be written off, all farmers would want to take loans for unlimited amounts. Banks would then have to ration credit; they would give it to their political masters favourites. Just as agricultural price support is buying votes at the consumers cost, agricultural credit is buying votes at the bank customers cost. It is odd that the prime minister should be proud of such things. Indians are proud to be Indians, but it is doubtful whether their government is a matter of pride despite being headed by such a distinguished prime minister.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TOTAL CHANGE

 Glimmerings of hope should not lead to euphoria alone. It should also induce some reflection. As the violent political battle over Nandigram enters the endgame phase, there needs to be analysis that looks beyond the immediate events and transcends the blame-game, which is the politicians stock-in-trade. That the violence in Nandigram is rooted in a conflict over turf and political dominance has been evident over a long time. But that cannot take away from the fact that the trigger for the violence was the news that land was to be acquired in the area to build a chemical hub in a special economic zone. A similar outbreak of violence had been narrowly averted in Singur where Tata Motors had been given agricultural land, which the government acquired after paying compensation. Violence in Nandigram and even in Singur (where the scale of the violence was less) had erupted as a protest against industrialization or, to be precise, against the taking away of agricultural land for setting up industrial units. The protest was certainly not confined to only those who were losing their land. Urban intellectuals, known for being fond of their armchairs, joined the protest. It did not strike anybody that when capital had fled West Bengal in the Sixties and Seventies, no one had ever come out on the streets to protest. It would not be unwarranted to conclude that the people of West Bengal are congenitally anti-industry.

 It is somewhat axiomatic that economic development is unavoidably linked to industrialization and that land for industrial units must come from agricultural land. Some people in West Bengal decided that they would defy this logic of history. The result was conflict, bloodshed and the loss of lives. The violence that the meaningless show of protest perpetrated only served to project West Bengal as a state that is hostile to industrialization and to diminish the faith of industrialists to invest in the state. If capitalists begin to perceive West Bengal once again as being unfriendly to investment, the people of West Bengal have no one else to blame save themselves. They may have ensured that their home state remains industrially stagnant and economically backward.

 There is no point blaming this or that political party for West Bengals plight. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), which today has positioned itself as being capital-friendly, at one time frightened away investments by promoting violence and irresponsible trade unionism. Mamata Banerjee has only taken lessons in protest and violence from her left rivals. The people of West Bengal have got the political parties they deserve. What West Bengal needs in order to rejuvenate itself is a total transformation in the attitude of its people. Priorities must move from poetry and protest to pelf and profit.

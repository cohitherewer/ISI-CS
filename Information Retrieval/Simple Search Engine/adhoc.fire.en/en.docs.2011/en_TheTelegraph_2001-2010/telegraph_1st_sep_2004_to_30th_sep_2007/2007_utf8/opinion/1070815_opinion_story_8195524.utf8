 What if India had not become 

 independent

 How a person lavishes adulation and articulates abuse is more often than not a commentary on both the individual and his social milieu. An English friend with a perverse sense of humour, who spends his leisure hours watching robust adventure films from another age unfashionable offerings such as Zulu, Northwest Frontier and Bhowani Junction has the ridiculous habit of complimenting people with the words: Youre a white man. Fortunately, he doesnt invoke the flip side of the colour divide while hurling abuse that would be too common. 

 Just in case the custodians of politically correct speech imagine that reactionary and racist old codgers are only to be found in the erstwhile imperial centres, I am reminded of a well-known subaltern historians recollections of his elderly father who lived in Allahabad. The gentleman in question was, quite naturally, in a permanent anxiety while negotiating Indian traffic. In moments of intense exasperation like when the scooter darted in unexpectedly from the left or the cow decided to block traffic he would exclaim, This country should never have been given Independence. 

 In the 60th year of independence when, apart from the crumbling gravestones, ersatz public schools and insensitively restored mansions, the British Raj seems well and truly history, it seems lunacy to hark back to the good old days when the burra khana was accompanied by the loyal toast to the King-Emperor. Yet, only 10 years ago, on the occasion of 50 years of independence, a national survey by India Today found, among other things, that more than half the respondents believed India was better governed by the Viceroys. Since more than half of those interviewed hadnt personally experienced British rule in any meaningful way, it may safely be assumed that the Raj nostalgia was actually an indictment of the political dispensation in 1997. 

 Since then, India has been on an almighty roll. The three decades between the Himalayan humiliation of the 1962 Sino-Indian war and the mortgaging of the gold reserves in 1991 were the dark ages when India seemed a good place to get away from. The despondency of that period has been replaced by a mood of unbridled optimism and a belief that the 21st century belongs to India. Generations of post-Midnights Children have learnt to take genuine pride in Jawaharlal Nehrus tryst with destiny. From cricket matches to Bollywood extravaganzas, the Indian flag has finally become a symbol of pride and determination. It took more than 50 years, but Independence has finally come of age. 

 Would Indias progress have followed a different trajectory and time-table if Indian independence had been delayed? 

 To answer the question, it is necessary to gauge what independence really implied in 1947. At one level, it meant the termination of the India Offices right to veto any decision taken in New Delhi Whitehall had long lost the ability and, for that matter, will to initiate policy. It meant the seamless transition from the Government of India Act of 1935 to the Constitution of 1950, and the integration of the native princely states into the republic. Above all, it meant substituting the Union Jack with the tricolour and replacing the symbol of the King-Emperor with the Asokan lions. Only Winston Churchill and a minusculity of old colonels in Cheltenham feared civil war if the district officer was replaced by a Bengali babu; the rest of Britain was singularly unmoved. 

 Deeply symbolic as these changes were, they were also peripheral. By the mid-Thirties, after the conclusion of the bitter debate over the 1935 Act, there was no real doubt in anyones mind that India was heading towards a form of self-government that was already in vogue in the Old Commonwealth, namely, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. The war with Germany and Japan derailed the time-table but also reinforced the popular determination in Britain to eschew over-involvement in the governance of the colonies, particularly India. The Indianization of institutions such as the ICS, the officer corps of the Indian army, the judiciary and the police began in the Thirties, acquired momentum during the War and would have been fully accomplished by the late Fifties. Even if the Union Jack had continued flying over Raisina Hill or been relegated to the top corner of the tricolour a reminder of the imperial connection la Australia and New Zealand Macaulays prophecy of enlightened Indians taking control of their own destiny would have been accomplished. 

 The King-Emperor or the Queen-Empress would doubtless have appointed a Governor-General in consultation with the cabinet in Delhi. In the initial years, the successor to Lord Mountbatten may have been English or even a New Zealander. In due course, the Indianization of the Raj Bhavans would have been complete, each occupant blessed with a knighthood. In time, especially during the socializing and polo matches that accompanied each royal visit, there would have been demands as in Australia from the outlanders to sever the imperial connection altogether. Yet, given the Indian elites penchant for knighthoods, titles and decorations, the Indian elite would have jealously guarded every last vestige of ornamentalism. It is not inconceivable that a desi version of peerages would have found its way into the Indian honours system. The Raj pandered to the innate Indian penchant for pomp and tamasha in a way the successor republic has never managed. Given half a chance, nationalist India would never have allowed this facet of eternal India to slip out of the states list of responsibilities. 

 In retrospect, there is a compelling case for the belief that the transfer of power in 1947 need not have been accompanied by the dismantling of the entire imperial connection. To my mind, there were two fundamental distortions that the Indian Independence Act ushered. 

 First, it is undeniable that it was the imminence of independence which gave additional momentum to Muslim separatism and ultimately made Pakistan a reality. Although the two-nation theory was born of the conviction that Hindu and Islamic ways of life were irreconcilable, the political provocation was the Muslim Leagues belief that majority rule involved the exclusion of minorities from the power structure. This belief was bolstered by the socialist insistence on a Constitution that conferred overriding powers to the Centre to facilitate industrialization and land reforms. Had the transfer of power in India been delayed or shelved in favour of real self-governance, it is more than likely that the 1935 Act would have been strengthened to accommodate federalist impulses. 

 The devolution of substantive power to the provinces would have led to internal competition between the different regions of India for more targeted and culturally sensitive development. Since resource mobilization would have been the responsibility of the provinces, India would have been spared the intrusive distortions of a redistributive Centre. In other words, economic activity would have been left to private initiative. Entrepreneurship would have been the engine of development right from the late Forties, when the Indian economy was blessed with mammoth sterling reserves and an industrial class rearing to make fresh conquests. The checks and balances of a federal structure would have ensured that the flowering of India, triggered by P.V. Narasimha Raos break from Nehruvian economics in 1991, would have been begun much earlier. More important, with power vested in the provinces, India would have persisted uninterruptedly with its commitment to free trade instead of falling back on self-destructive protectionism. 

 Indian independence delayed Indias re-emergence as a great power by at least 50 years. In the natural course, India would have had a formidable economic presence in south-east Asia, the Persian Gulf states and Europe. Instead, it is just about shedding its dismal image as the supplier of coolies and cheap labour. 

 Finally, independence killed off the princely states, which at one time controlled more than a third of British India. The Maharajas and the lesser chiefs were guilty of many lifestyle follies but, as a class, they symbolized Indias link with a pre-colonial heritage. Rooted in their own distinctive cultures, they provided the best guarantees against mindless deracination and cosmopolitanism. They were Indias home-grown aristocracy, tied to the land and socially connected with the old ruling classes of Europe. It was not democracy per se that reduced them to page three decorations and tourist attractions; it was the assault on deference, perceived as the inevitable accompaniment of independence that undermined social stability. Combined with the enforced austerity, which followed socialist mismanagement, the weakening of the traditional structures of power and influence deprived India of a clutch of people groomed in the ethos of leadership. 

 In 1947, India already possessed the human potential to make the transition from subordination to self-confidence. Independence was meant to create the environment for this post-War leap to the global stage. Overwhelmed by a mixture of bad ideology and infuriating social complexes, our leadership blew it all. It took India more than 50 years to recover from and come to terms with independence. The process is still incomplete. 

 Of course it could have been far worse. But the world always assumed India was a cut above the Matabeleland and Zanzibar.

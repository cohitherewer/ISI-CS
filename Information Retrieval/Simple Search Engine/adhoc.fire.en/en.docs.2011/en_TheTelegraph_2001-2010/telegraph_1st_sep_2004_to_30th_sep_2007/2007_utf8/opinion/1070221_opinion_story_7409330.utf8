 NEARLY ALWAYS WRONG

 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES

 Its tiny, but essential. Without it wed sometimes misread written English. Yet, of its three common uses today, one is nearly always wrong. Im talking of the apostrophe. This useful punctuation mark is not ancient. Youll find it at times in Chaucer in one use, to mark an omitted letter. He writes once of th estat, tharaie, the nombre of his Canterbury pilgrims; and, more often, n, representing ne not or nor as in nolde, meaning nor would, or nis, meaning there isnt.

 But the commonest modern use is missing: the genitive s. To Chaucer, he was not writing the millers or the knights tale, but the milleres and the knightes, the spelling of his time and long after. 

 Todays usage is in fact quite recent. When Francis Bacon dedicated his famous essays, soon after 1600, to the Duke of Buckingham, he wrote a good name is like a precious oyntment...such will your graces name bee. The modern your graces was in use but not entrenched until around a century later.

 It has its problems. For euphonys sake, plurals ending in -s get only an apostrophe, not s. And we extend this to some singular names ending in -s, as with Xerxes army or in Jesus name. Yet we write the ugly Mr Joness house. Why? The traditional rule is that modern s-ending names get s, classical ones an apostrophe only. But (even if one knows which is which: what about Erasmus?) this now sounds old-fashioned; these days, I would write Socratess disciples.

 Modern myth

 The usage has also grown a modern myth: that you can add the s only to names or nouns denoting people, but for others must write of such-and-such. Nonsense. Wordsworth wrote of a primrose by a rivers brim; Shakespeare of a pins fee and the laws delays. The myth holds a grain of truth: for people, we do prefer s to of. But that is no rule, merely a preference. 

 In contrast to this usage, another one is tending to die out: the apostrophe to replace an omitted letter.

 The 18th century loved (or lovd?) such usages as this from Pope: Rejoicd of all the numrous Greeks to see... A century ago, writers regularly used an apostrophe for the missing H of Cockney speech. A famous cartoon caption in Punch read: Eave arf a brick at im. But changes of taste have driven this out.

 We can still write focsle of a ship, but may equally write focsle. Capn is dying out of boys stories. Even such a newborn usage as rock n roll, I suspect, will soon be a newly dead one: text-messagers dont use apostrophes.

 Weird plurals

 In one area, however, the missing-letter apostrophe flourishes as never before: in words like Im, hes, youre, Ill, weve, Id and their like. And in the negative: cant, maynt, oughtnt, wont, couldnt, didnt, havent and others. Indeed there can be two in one word: he shouldntve done that.

 In such uses, the apostrophe does what no other punctuation mark can: it alters pronunciation. I wouldnt recommend these usages for all purposes. But they represent the real speech of real people; writing a column like this, I employ them regularly. And so to the third use. In my local market, stallholders habitually mark their wares apples, onions and the like. Well, stallholders OK, you think? My wifes grand-niece is choosing which of several universitys to apply to and some of their staff wouldnt spot the mistake.

 Why this weird plural sprang up, no one knows. Theres no logic in it, as there is in some misuses. Yet it has far-off precedents: MPs, MiGs, FAQs; and the 1750s. In all such cases, you can omit the apostrophe, and I do. But even I try to dot my is, cross my ts and mind my ps and qs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ENDS AND MEANS

 Reforms, economic or political, can be risky business. To the army-backed interim administration in Dhaka, the arrest of Sheikh Hasina Wajed is part of the plan to reform Bangladeshi politics. No matter what they say in public, even her accusers know that the charges of corruption against Ms Wajed are extremely thin. They have made no secret of what they actually intend to do with her. Dhakas new rulers want to keep her and also her political rival, Begum Khaleda Zia out of politics. But, as it happens so often with rulers everywhere, the new regime in Bangladesh may have overreached itself by arresting Ms Wajed. Not only the ends but also the means of Fakhruddin Ahmeds administration will henceforth look increasingly suspect. And this impression may not be corrected even if Ms Zia too is sent to prison on corruption or some other charges. Yet, the interim administration had initially raised hopes of a cleaner political culture in Bangladesh. Its bold steps against corrupt politicians and businessmen, and especially against religious zealots, earned it much goodwill at home and abroad. Even when it deferred the elections indefinitely, Bangladeshis were prepared to give it the benefit of doubt. Endless street fights, hartals and the senseless politics of confrontation had made the people sceptical of the parties ability to govern the country. It is now the peoples turn to be sceptical of the intentions of Mr Ahmeds government. 

 The world has good reasons to be concerned about what happens in Bangladesh. The rise of Islamist extremism in the country is one of them. True, the interim administration has shown its determination to fight the evil. But it is doubtful if a political vacuum is the best antidote to religious and other kinds of extremism. It is one thing to cleanse politics of corruption and other vices and quite another to replace democracy with an autocratic system. While it supports the new regimes attempts to clean up Bangladeshs politics, the international community cannot afford to help the creation of another political vacuum in the country. How New Delhi views the situation in Dhaka is of particular importance both to India and to its neighbour. True, India cannot do anything that would be seen as interfering in its neighbours affairs. But it would be worse if India is perceived to be helping anti-democracy forces.

 FLOOD REPLAY

 Floods in West Bengal are sometimes bad, sometimes not so bad, and sometimes particularly bad. But they do occur with unfailing regularity. This year the flooding could be put, even with bureaucratic evenness of expression, in the particularly bad category. Natures excess is in no ones control. Nor can the swelling of rivers be prevented. What is amazing is the scale of loss and disruption each time the floods come. These happen with a regularity that matches the floods, yet no one is willing to learn from history. That lesson seems particularly inaccessible to political leaders and bureaucrats. The allied geography lesson seems much easier: much of West Bengal is a deltaic plain lying in the monsoon belt. This lesson is never forgotten, because geography provides an incompetent, indifferent administration with the alibi for disaster.

 Weak and broken embankments have had a big role to play in this years flooding. Even the chief minister has had to acknowledge that the repair of embankments has not progressed as planned. How many more floods will the administration need to finish the repairs? This failure is only one of many. The administrations in the more flood-prone areas appear always to lack the readiness, the expertise and the material for protection, rescue and relief. Even the inevitable aftermath of widespread diseases catches them unaware every time. Yet floods are, in a way, the least unpredictable of natural disasters. Even more predictable is the release of water from the dam reservoirs as soon as rivers begin to rise. West Bengal is supposed to be producing hundreds of brilliant students of the applied sciences. Yet no science, no advanced technology, is being applied to relieve people of a regular form of suffering and loss, a routine way of plunging the poor into progressively greater poverty after every spell of heavy rains. The Dutch began their struggle against the encroaching sea not just a seasonal rainfall 2,000 years ago, and have struggled and learnt and bettered their methods till they completed their Delta Project recently. This is considered one of the wonders of the modern world by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Dutch have not solved all the problems; no one can solve every problem that has its roots in nature. But a start has to be made somewhere. Why has West Bengal never even tried?

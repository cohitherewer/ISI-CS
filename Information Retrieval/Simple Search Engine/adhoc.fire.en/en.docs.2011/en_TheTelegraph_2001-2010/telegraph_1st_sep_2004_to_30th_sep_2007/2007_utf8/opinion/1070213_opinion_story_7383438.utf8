 TOP GEAR

 If there were any lingering doubts whether India Inc. has become a force to reckon with at the global level, the last fortnight should have got rid of them completely. Indian companies have already made overseas acquisitions worth around $20 billion this year, half of the $40 billion worth of mergers and acquisition deals sewn up by Indian companies abroad last year, and more than the $16.6 billion notched up for all of 2005. Indian companies now have the confidence to go out and aggressively bid for companies several times their size, and a billion dollars has become small change. At the same time, while Indian companies are snapping up firms abroad, foreign corporates are buying into Indian growth. The sky-high valuation put by Vodafone on Hutchison Essar is an indication of the potential of the Indian market and the kind of returns it expects to generate from it.

 There are many reasons for Indian companies buying assets abroad. One of them, as in the Hindalco-Novelis deal, is to access markets and technology abroad and to utilize cheap raw materials available at home. Scale is very important in many industries and some deals, like the Tata Steel acquisition of Corus, fit in that category. Then there are some buys that are for raw materials, such as the acquisitions by Indian companies of coal mines in Australia. In some instances, such as Tata Teas acquisition of Tetley, brand acquisition is the driving force. Vertical integration is another reason for acquisitions. Exploiting the arbitrage opportunity provided by low-cost Indian labour is a factor that looms large in IT deals. Of course, the fact that valuations in India are much higher than valuations in these countries make such acquisitions attractive. The abundance of liquidity is another factor, because many Indian companies are under-leveraged and this is a good time for borrowing funds, as spreads on emerging market and Indian debt are at historical lows.

 The strange thing, however, is that while corporate India and the media have been gung-ho about the rash of deals, the markets reaction has been decidedly negative. One reason is that the market takes a short-term view of the deals, with an eye on the impact it will have on the next quarters earnings. Secondly, while corporate chieftains pay a premium for control, ordinary investors have no reason to pay such a premium. Hence the disconnect in perceptions. There is also the fact that the Indian firms are buying into saturated markets, while foreign companies are buying into growth. That difference was underlined on Monday, when the market hammered the Hindalco stock, but sent the Vodafone scrip up. In short, while Indian companies have proved capable of defending their turf and of taking the battle into their competitors territory, they would be wise to remember the historical fact that only a third of M amp;A deals create value.

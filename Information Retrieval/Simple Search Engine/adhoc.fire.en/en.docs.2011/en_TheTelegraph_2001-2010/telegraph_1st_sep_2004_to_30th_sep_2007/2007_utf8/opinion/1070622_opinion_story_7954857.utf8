The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HIGH OFFICE

 What A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is doing to his own dignity is his own business. But by saying that he will run for a second term provided there was certainty of his winning, he is also demeaning the office he occupies. The least that he owes to the people of India is to depart without making himself look ridiculous. What is sad is that certain vested interests are leading him on, and he, it seems, is none the wiser. The Congress has already announced its own candidate for the post of president. The Bharatiya Janata Party has also decided that it will support the present vice-president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, as the presidential candidate. Mr Shekhawat will have the backing of the National Democratic Alliance. But the BJP cannot ensure that all those who are opposed to the Congress will support Mr Shekhawat. Even within the sangh parivar, the Shiv Sena has come out in support of Pratibha Patil, who it sees as the first person from Maharashtra to become the head of State. To the Shiv Sena, its Marathi identity is much more important than its loyalty to Hindutva. Even within the BJP, there are rumblings of dissent regarding Mr Shekhawats candidacy.

 The Third Fronts position is much worse since it finds itself in a quandary. It cannot support a BJP-sponsored candidate. Nor can it vote for Ms Patil, whose name has been put forward by the Congress. It is thus lobbying Mr Kalam to run the presidential race a second time. The Left parties did not support Mr Kalam the first time round so the question of their supporting him now does not arise. This leaves the Third Front on no-mans- land. To give that land some identity and sense of belonging, it is trying to get Mr Kalam to be its candidate. Mr Kalam seems to be a reluctant starter. He would like another stint in the house on Raisina Hill but is too coy to come out and say it openly. Hence the provisions: first about consensus and then about certainty. The change in terms is something of a quibble since a consensus will make it a certainty. Mr Kalam must realize that as the president of India, he cannot stoop to bargaining. If he wanted a second term, he should have announced his willingness a long time ago. The office of the president, as it was originally visualized by the founding fathers, was seen to be above the shoddiness of politics. That original image is taking a beating, although not for the first time.

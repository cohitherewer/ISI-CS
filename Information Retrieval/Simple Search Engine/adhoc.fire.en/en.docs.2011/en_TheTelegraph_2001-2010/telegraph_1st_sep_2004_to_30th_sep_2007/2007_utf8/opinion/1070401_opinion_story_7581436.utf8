 Lure of the air

 Sir Indian, the national carrier, has every right to ground overweight air-hostesses (Pay for hostesses in weight tussle, March 28). Passengers do not pay through their noses to be attended upon by obese air-hostesses, especially when those in the private airlines are young and obliging. Most passengers consider the pleasure of being served by beautiful women aboard as one of the luxuries of air travel. Indian will only lose its passengers to the private flyers if it continues with air-hostesses who huff and puff down the aisles.

 Yours faithfully,

 Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Hate thy neighbour

 Sir The barbaric behaviour of the local train passengers towards Dilip Mondal, priest and English teacher in Don Bosco School, comes as no surprise to those who have the misfortune of travelling daily by these trains (Train card players slap priest for seat, March 28). Passengers on long-distance trains also fall victim to ruffians, who forcibly occupy reserved seats to sit and chat or play cards. The railway protection force remain mute spectators. The Union railway minister, Lalu Prasad, who boasts of having improved the condition of the Indian Railways, should take note of this incident and ensure the safety of the travellers.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir The menace posed by daily passengers, such as those who abused Dilip Mondal, is a cause for concern. Most travellers are afraid of registering complaints and choose to suffer silently. They also refuse to intervene when they see others being manhandled. Mondal should be praised for holding his ground resolutely throughout the journey, and later registering his complaint with the police. However, it is doubtful if witnesses will come forward to testify against the miscreants. As long as the RPF personnel remain lackadaisical about their duty, more cases like Mondals will continue to occur. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

 Sir The resilience displayed by Dilip Mondal against the hooligans who ill-treated him are exemplary. He did not hit back at the men but did not give up his seat either. Even after the harrowing incident, Mondal did not shirk work and returned to Calcutta only after having completed his assignment. Had the card-players had some decency, they would not have insulted the respectable priest and teacher. The apparent moral decline in society is alarming. Now people do not think before misbehaving even with a man in a cassock. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The reasons put forward by the Union minister for culture, Ambika Soni, for the disappearance of 35 centrally-protected monuments /sites do not sound convincing (Monuments go missing, March 28). It is difficult to conjecture how the monuments could vanish from the map after being centrally-protected. The causes sited by Soni, such as rapid urbanization, construction of multi-storeyed residential and commercial buildings, implementation of development projectsand so on, cannot be reason enough for the loss of the heritage sites. 

 Urbanization does not necessarily entail the destruction of monuments. If the construction of multi-storeyed buildings has resulted in the disappearance of heritage sites then the municipal authorities concerned should be held entirely responsible for the loss. It is ironic that when crores of rupees are being drained out of the public exchequer to provide protection to the VIPs, nothing is being done to preserve the heritage monuments, which, once lost, can never be replaced. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

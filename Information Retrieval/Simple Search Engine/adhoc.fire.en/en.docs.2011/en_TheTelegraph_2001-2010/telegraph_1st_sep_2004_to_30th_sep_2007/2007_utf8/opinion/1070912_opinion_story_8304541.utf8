The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LIGHT HEARTED

 There is no point in seeing red. The West Bengal government has little misgivings about its self-importance or that of its minions. So it was only expected that the possibility of being denied the privilege of carrying aloft the most distinguishing marker of power should have agitated it no end. Ever since the high court, prompted by a public interest litigation, came down on the state government heavily for not doing enough to stop the misuse of beacons on cars, and threatened to disallow their use across the board except for specific emergency services, it has laboured hard to avoid such an eventuality. While it kept afoot its half-hearted attempts to restrict the indiscriminate use of red lights through police raids on the streets, it plied the court with a Central government notification that supported the use of beacons for select public servants and granted the state the authority to draw up its own list of users. The state government enthusiastically seized upon the chance. It now accords the right of use to 40 categories of VIPs, and reserves the privilege of using the flasher for a select list of 13. An exalted category of VVIPs has automatically been created, with full State sanction and authority bearing upon it, within the set of VIPs. For a country stifled by the VIP culture, this can hardly be seen as a welcome development. 

 The trouble for the administration is more immediate. The court wants the licences for the use of beacons, particularly for the flashers, to be prominently displayed in front of the vehicles. But a police force, which habitually gives as much respect to terrorists using the beacon to escape the law as to the chief minister, can hardly be trusted to use its discretion in hauling up VIPs and affirming their credentials any more confidently than before. The presence of red lights, whether they flash or not, on top of cars will continue to remain the inviolable property right of not merely 40 categories of VIPs, but also an army of people who live off their association with them. Beacons are supposed to communicate a sense of urgency or importance. There can be no denying the necessity of red lights fitted to pilot cars of dignitaries for security reasons or to ambulances and fire engines. But they cannot be allowed to multiply and become omnipresent only because they suit the purposes of the power-hungry and their stragglers.

 THE FUNNY 

 HUMAN MIND 

 - How often we deviate from rationality 

 Writing 

 on the wall

 Ashok V. Desai

 In the May 5 issue of the New 

 Scientist, Kate Douglas and Dan Jones laid down ten 

 rules on how to make better decisions. Since I am not enthusiastic 

 about taking decisions, most of the hints went past me. 

 But I picked up some nice psychological jargon; and what 

 I found interesting was how often the human mind deviates 

 from rationality. Take a game, for instance, in which one 

 would double ones money if a coin landed heads up, and 

 nothing if it landed tails up. In a long series of such 

 bets, one would come out neither losing nor gaining anything; 

 one would come out even. In a single spin of the coin, one 

 may come out twice as rich, or may lose whatever one has 

 bet. But apparently, most humans refuse to take this bet. 

 On the average, people refuse to take a 50:50 bet unless 

 the amount they would win is twice as high as the amount 

 they would lose, or higher. Psychologists call this loss 

 aversion. 

 One would have thought that the 

 more complicated a problem, the more one should think about 

 it. No, say psychologists, just the opposite. People reason 

 out simple problems and come up with solutions fairly quickly. 

 But the more they think about a complex problem, the more 

 confused they become, and the less capable they become of 

 deciding. Psychologists call this information overload. 

 When one is in danger of being overwhelmed by information, 

 the best thing to do, apparently, is to take a quick decision 

 on the basis of partial analysis. In other words, it is 

 better to find solutions in terms of a reasoning mechanism 

 a mind can handle, not in terms of the volume of the reasoning 

 a problem requires. 

 One illustration of this is to 

 be found in investment decisions. The larger the number 

 of investment choices people are presented with, the less 

 likely they are to invest. The Telegraph gives prices 

 of a thousand shares; financial newspapers give prices of 

 seven times as many shares. How many people make investment 

 decisions after reading these pages? I was an active investor 

 at certain points in my life; but I never read the financial 

 pages of newspapers. Most people who invest follow simple 

 rules or theories to make a choice; the choices open to 

 them hardly matter. Some people exchange hints with friends 

 or follow advisers whom their friends recommend. This is 

 called peer pressure. It can be very dangerous. It is behind 

 most mass atrocities.

 However, one must not act on too 

 little information. Suppose you are asked to spin a wheel 

 and, on the basis of the number where it stops, to guess 

 the number of countries in Africa. Suppose the wheel is 

 rigged so as to stop only at 10 and 65. The average number 

 of countries estimated by people whose spin led the wheel 

 to stop at 10 was 25; for people whose spin led the wheel 

 to stop at 65, the average number of countries came to 45. 

 The higher the number at which the wheel stopped after their 

 spin, the higher the number of African countries the participants 

 assumed. This is called the anchoring effect.

 But whether you go for a quick 

 and simple solution or prefer to argue things out with yourself 

 in detail, you must not do it if you are feeling cheerful. 

 For people make better decisions when they are sad. Psychologists 

 call this depressive realism. 

 How often we have an argument 

 with someone who simply refuses to see our point of view, 

 and who instead keeps repeating arguments in favour of his 

 position! We would not admit it, but he thinks precisely 

 the same thing about us. Everyone draws on evidence by preference 

 that supports his case, and tends to underplay evidence 

 that goes against what he believes. This is called confirmation 

 bias. A striking way to prove confirmation bias is to take 

 a statement like If there is a D on one side, there is 

 a 5 on the other. Suppose you are given four cards bearing 

 D, A, 2 and 5, which cards would you turn over to test this 

 statement? Most people would turn over the D and the 5, 

 thinking that the statement would be confirmed if the two 

 cards had 5 and D respectively on the obverse. But the card 

 with the 5 is irrelevant, for the statement says nothing 

 about what would be behind it. Only the card with the D 

 provides a test of the proposition, which would be dis,proved 

 if that card did not have a 5 behind it. 

 Open your wardrobe. How many clothes 

 do you find there that you have not worn in a month, a year, 

 ten years? Some no longer fit you; you do not like the colour 

 of some, and some well, you just ignore them somehow. 

 If so, why do you not throw away all those clothes you never 

 wear? You may be stuck for an answer; in that case, say 

 it is the sunk cost effect. Just because you have already 

 spent on those clothes, you will hesitate to throw them 

 away. And the more expensive they were, the less likely 

 you are to throw them away. This operates in other spheres 

 as well. If you find you have tickets for two performances 

 on the same evening, you will go to the one that cost you 

 more, not to the one that you think you will enjoy most. 

 One rule appealed to me. There 

 are many decisions which one does not enjoy making, or where 

 there is no unique or happy choice. According to Douglas 

 and Jones, these are decisions that are best left to others. 

 Choosing wine over a dinner, for instance. Some people study 

 the list of a hundred wines long and seriously, interrogate 

 the waiter, make a tedious show of expertise and wisdom, 

 and finally choose a wine that is hardly distinguishable 

 from another. When I have a fellow-diner who betrays the 

 slightest interest, I leave the choice of wine to him. And 

 if I have to choose, I have a list of good wines in my mind, 

 accumulated over a lifetime; I order from that list.

 Finally, a word about two decision 

 rules familiar to economists, called maximizing and satisficing. 

 A maximizer chooses what is best under the prevalent constraints 

 and circumstances; a satisficer chooses what would give 

 a certain minimum level of satisfaction. The more complex 

 a choice, the less satisfied are maximizers with theirs, 

 and the bet- ter off are satisficers. In one study of job 

 seekers, maximizers ended up earning 20 per cent more than 

 satisficers; but they were much less satisfied with their 

 choice. 

 Who knows what heights of wit 

 I would reach if I went on with this column? Maybe I would, 

 at some point, make my readers swoon with delight; all Calcutta 

 would be littered with swooners. Readers would be so affected 

 by the experience that they would wait for me to send them 

 into swoons every other Tuesday. But I have learnt the wisdom 

 of satisficing; I am perfectly happy to end at this point.

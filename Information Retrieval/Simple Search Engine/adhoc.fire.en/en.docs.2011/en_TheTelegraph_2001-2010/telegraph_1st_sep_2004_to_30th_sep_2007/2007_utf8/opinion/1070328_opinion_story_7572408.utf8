The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 EXIT SHAKIRA

 Why was Shakira rather a non-event in Mumbai? She came, she swayed, but she did not exactly conquer. Perhaps what she has finally lost out to in a city like Mumbai is something so obvious that the significance of the phenomenon almost fails to strike those who are actually in the thick of it. This is the triumph of Bollywood. Spectacle and entertainment, together with the human interest that makes up real popularity, are now catered to almost entirely by the singers, dancers, choreographers, directors and, of course, the mega- and not-so-megastars of Bollywood. This combination of spectacle, music and celebrity is both sprung from the cinema and has a vitality of its own. Its magic works not only within the country, but also on Indians abroad. Immensely popular playback singers, like Himesh Reshammiya, Sonu Nigam, Sukhwinder Singh and Alka Yagnik, deliver to live Indian audiences all over the world what is sought less and less from foreign performers, no matter how big the latter may be internationally. What people come to watch, whether it be a concert, an award ceremony or some NRI sammelan, is a live version of what Bollywood pulls off with increasing panache on the silver screen these days. This panache is a combination of technology, the mastery of winning formulae and iconhood, all taken up in forms of locally fabricated contemporaneity which are becoming increasingly difficult to substitute with imported glamour. The global element in this everything that is unabashedly derived from Hollywood or foreign pop music is all perfectly brought over and made part of this winning, home-grown formula.

 It is perhaps bootless to lament the death of taste, or of cosmopolitanism, in the wake of such a phenomenon. None of the names mentioned above can ever, in itself, claim to rise above the flotsam and jetsam of the film and entertainment industries in India. Yet, they command a kind of popularity that even the biggest names from abroad would not be able to match. A Sting concert in Mumbai would be, therefore, the same sort of limited, connoisseurs event as, say, a performance by the Vienna Philharmonic. It would hardly arouse the sort of general frenzy associated with events like Madonna at Wembley in the early Nineties. As with their coffee, Indians now prefer their local instants to real Colombian.

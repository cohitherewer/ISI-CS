 DIARY

 The party is elsewhere

 In the season of iftaar parties, the biggest draws for politicians and journalists alike are those thrown by the president, vice-president, prime minister and the lady from 10 Janpath. Vice-president Hamid Ansari had thrown his bash last Monday, but to the disappointment of the host and the photographers who were waiting to click our netas at their chomping-networking best, the attendance was a mere trickle. Even those who had cared to turn up, bound by protocol or politics, seemed to be in a mad rush to leave. The reason and Sonia Gandhi was heard explaining it to Ansari in terms of her own love of cricket was the Twenty20 final between India and Pakistan. Monday also happened to be the day when the Congress had hoped to launch Rahul Gandhi with great fanfare. When the papers came out the next morning, however, it was clear that Dhonis boys had pushed the new Congress gen-sec into a corner of the front page. So, did the vice-presidents men and the Congresss party-planners commit a gaffe? Ansaris staff were ready with their excuse: they had never thought India would progress as far as the finals. The young Gandhis launchers had a more complicated reason to offer. After Monday, the next auspicious day would not come until October 11. And good old tradition dictated that the prince must be crowned on a shubh mahurat. The Boys in Blue had no business being such spoilsports!

 With Rahul Gandhi as a gen-sec now, will anything change in the Congress? In particular, the functioning of its grossly incompetent and ignorant media department? Consider this: the department in question was completely unaware that the party had produced a booklet on the Indo-US nuclear deal to counter the vigorous Left propaganda against it. When a news agency ran the story, and journos asked the partys media secretary, Tom Vadakkan, for a copy of the booklet, Vadakkan flatly denied its existence that is, until one questioner silently produced it from her bag. Soon enough, a postman arrived and delivered a packet to Vadakkan. And guess what it contained? The booklet, of course despatched by ordinary post (worth a 15-rupee stamp) from the office of Mukul Wasnik, next door to Vadakkans. Perhaps Wasnik and he are not the best of friends. But what about the dozens of peons, supposedly there to ferry files and papers from one room to another? They were probably busy photocopying confidential letters and circulating (or selling) them. But thats another story, for another day.

 If you thought it was just the Congress that was in a bit of a mess, hold on. The BJPs affairs are messier. The national executive in Bhopal was a damp squib, and the day Rahul Gandhi was anointed as Congress gen-sec, BJP spokesperson Prakash Jawdekar blasted the Congresss cult of sons of daughters and rattled off names of Congress leaders whose relatives are ensconced in positions of profit. Of course, we know what happened after that. Rajnath Singhs son, Pankaj, was made chief of the BJPs youth wing in UP. But this dynasty was not destined to last. Pankaj has had to resign following criticism within the party.

 True, Dhoni and his boys have been invited to 10 Janpath, but meeting Madam is a difficult proposition. Some people find it easy though. The two Indian Idol finalists, Prashant Tamang and Amit Paul, happened to be among the lucky few. But this had less to do with their singing skills and more to do with the fact that the show was produced by Medi-Tech, a company owned by Niret Alva, son of the AICC gen-sec, Margaret Alva. Alva even sent a note to Lalu Prasad, requesting him to attend her sons show. Lalu Prasad may have misread the note, because he went and attended a rival show. Or could there have been some other reason behind it?

 What is worse Amar Singh with Amitabh Bachchan, or Rajiv Shukla with Shah Rukh Khan? Just as people were beginning to feel thankful for being spared the daily dose of the double-alpha pair, comes the equally disturbing sight of a ponytailed SRK with Shukla whose girth is almost symbolic of the BCCIs wide reach. Shukla was the man who arranged for Shah Rukh, son in tow, to fly to Joburg. He also escorted SRK on to the field after India won which resulted in the memorable scene of Harbhajan Singh hoisting him up. The superstar is known to have invested in Congressman Shuklas BAG films, which will soon launch news and entertainment channels.

 Sonia Gandhi shuffled the AICC pack and Janardhan Dwivedi came out as the big loser. Dwivedi was removed from two key posts chairman of the AICCs media cell and observer for Punjab and Haryana. Worse, Dwivedi, who had also written speeches for Sonia, found that he had lost his room along with the posts. His room, right next to Sonias, went to Rahul Gandhi, newly appointed gen-sec. Poor Dwivedi has been asked to shift to Ambika Sonis chamber. Dwivedis displacement has to do mainly with the Congress losing Punjab. The former Punjab CM, Amarinder Singh put all the blame for the poll debacle on Dwivedi. In Haryana, he was accused of being inaccessible to party workers. The media department, too, became something of a malfunctioning organ under him, with briefings reduced to a trickle. The tidings have not robbed Dwivedi of his smile though. Our man is quite convinced that the speeches he penned for Madam would help him get a plum posting soon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PLAYING PRESIDENT

 It is important for India that its President does not take himself too seriously. In a modern democracy, he ought not to have much to do, apart from being symbolic and nice, and not too much in the way of important things. Being a figurehead might be fun after all, for the President himself and for the country in general. So one would have to be rather a killjoy to object to the idea of having Mr Amitabh Bachchan as the nations First Citizen. Some of Mr Bachchans friends in politics have floated the idea of his candidature for presidency and it does not seem to be a bad one at all.

 The only way to infuse some life into an essentially redundant job is to perform it with aplomb not in the earnest and dutiful sense of perform, but in the more extravagant, histrionic sense of the word. And who better than Mr Bachchan to bring to the Rashtrapati Bhavan that quality of tongue-in-cheek gravitas, which that great house, with its unreal gardens and glittering banquets, would be absolutely perfect for? Perhaps the secret to a successful presidency lies in not being completely earnest about the role, to think not so much about the politics or ethics of it as of its aesthetics. The President is all about being seen and occasionally heard, and if a referendum were to be taken on the issue today, then most of India would agree, perhaps, that Mr Bachchan fares better on both counts than the incumbent. Ronald Reagan had done it years ago. Before he became president of the United States of America, he was president of the Screen Actors Guild, the labour union that represented most Hollywood actors. In between, he had been the governor of California, a post that is now filled by Arnold Schwarzenegger another actor, though with more muscle than Reagan. In a country where governors and presidents wield real power and are not just decorative figures, a body-builders machismo or the current presidents (largely unwitting) goofiness have become expressions of that power in all its terror-inspiring comicality. Mr Bachchans role would be far less dire than his American counterparts, and would require of him nothing that is very different from the qualities which helped him pull off the KBC host and Sexy Sam so consummately even if Nishabd posed a slight problem.

 Mr Chandrababu Naidu has expressed his solemn confidence in Mr Bachchan as a great motivator, and in his being able to fill the nation, as its President, with the we-can-do-it feeling. Mr Naidu is, indeed, more right than he realizes. The last thing Mr Bachchan should do as President is shed his comic genius. He is already a natural orator, and can recite his fathers poetry if the occasion demands, since a versifying President seems to be the order of the day. Besides, it is time the nations symbolic head had a better hairdo.

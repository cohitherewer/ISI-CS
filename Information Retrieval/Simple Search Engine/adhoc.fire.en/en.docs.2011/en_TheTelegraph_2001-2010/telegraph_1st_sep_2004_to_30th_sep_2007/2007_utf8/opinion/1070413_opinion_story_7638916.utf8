 Stare at the idiot screen 

 Bonafide - Malvika Singh

 The news these days on our television screens is about cricket and nothing else. It is as though India has no other concern or problem except the status of this game. It is strange how sports and Bollywood, fashion and gossip have begun to dominate and overwhelm the media, both print and television, resulting in the dilution of other specialized professions. Wherever you look, there is the face of some model, actor or sportsperson endorsing things they know little about. As a result, they have managed to reduce dialogue, and everything else that goes with intellectual growth, to a static and comparatively superficial plane. 

 This development has been welcomed by those who manage the media because it is far easier to churn out programmes with minimal research and planning. Extempore, rather glib interventions that stem from limited experience, irritate the discerning viewer, dumbing down the debate on small screen. Advertisers, over the decades, have argued that the bulk of audiences is not particularly smart and needs limited intellectual sustenance and, therefore, have never sponsored intelligent programmes that raise issues without any hype.

 The lowest common denominator is what they address because they wrongly assume ordinary Indians to be foolish. In fact, if one looks around and observes the reality on the streets and public spaces of urban India, it becomes clear that the educated and semi-educated Indians are the ones who break the law, drive wildly, park in the wrong place, pee in public, bribe the authorities to get their way, demand dowry, beat their wives, are intolerant to other castes, amuse themselves by scratching their names on the surface of ancient monuments and generally commit acts that go against the rules of a dignified existence. 

 The losing game

 This new species defines the urban, mobile Indian but, unfortunately, the media is increasingly catering to this breed and its demands. It would make more sense to introduce, through the small screen, this burgeoning class to energetic intellectual, cultural and economic debates and programmes which would equip them better to deal with a changing world, giving them the confidence that will help in checking the social anarchy that India is battling.

 The programmes are structured in a similar fashion on all channels. The people invited are pretty much the same, and often, when you switch channels, you feel that you are still watching the show you had wanted to move away from. That is how similar and dull it all is. Rajiv Masand and Karan Thapar bring us lively moments that are thought through and provocative, as do citizen journalists. The rest needs creative reordering and an infusion of vitality that will trigger the viewers imagination and their minds. To think that ordinary Indians want dumbed down programming is insane, to say the least. Maybe, it is the well-to-do and the educated who are happy with superficial content. 

 Enough of cricket. We should be ashamed of the poor and erratic performance of the Indian team when it comes to cricket. It is clear that the essential discipline required to be on top of the game, whether in terms of physical health and strategic thinking, is virtually non-existent. Money seems to be on top of the priority list and the obsession to move up the social ladder and indulge in competitive consumerism appears to have blurred the real goal. 

 The issue is not about losing a game. It is the poor performance of players that makes the people angry. Brand managers will have to change the faces that they recruit to sell their successful products. Why would anyone want to spend their hard-earned money on products endorsed by a bunch of losers?

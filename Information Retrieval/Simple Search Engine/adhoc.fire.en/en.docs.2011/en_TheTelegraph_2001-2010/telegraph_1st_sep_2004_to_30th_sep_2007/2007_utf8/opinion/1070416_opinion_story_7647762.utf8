The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LINE OF FIRE

 Indias ministry of personnel has a bloodied nose. Its latest appraisal form for the countrys bureaucrats inquired into women officers menstrual history, the date of their last monthly discharge and medical confinement on account of maternity leave. The queries, allegedly inspired by health concerns, created such a furore among the female respondents that the ministry has decided to withdraw the questionnaire. But hackles have been raised, and not merely within the white-collared bureaucracy. Women professionals throughout the country feel outraged at the raising of such irrelevant questions, and justifiably so. The answers were supposed to have helped the ministry assess the women employees fitness. However, there is no reason to suppose that menstruating women are either unfit to work or encumbered in any way to perform in the workplace. The physical discomfort or temporary hormone-induced changes in temperament, if any, have little bearing on work. Women learn to cope with these problems from a very early age. This learning forms an intrinsic part of their personal grooming. Besides, there is no reason to believe that men do not undergo similar mood swings or experience no such unease caused by their metabolism or other biological functions of their bodies. Menstruation management, in fact, is no different from the management of other bodily discharges. Even in active combat, the menstrual cycle has not been held against women in the evaluation of their performance. 

 But apart from the questions irrelevance, what has seemingly affected the women bureaucrats more are the queries perceived intrusion into the personal space. The reaction is, in a way, typical. The reproductive functions of a womans body are not a subject that easily lends itself to discussion, particularly in the public sphere. They invariably evoke embarrassed silences or outrage, as in this case. However, if the government is indeed concerned about its women officers health, it could make the queries more age- or case-specific, and show more confidence in the abilities of its women employees.

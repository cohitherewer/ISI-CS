 Letters to Editor

 Too much concern

Much ado about nothing

 Sir It is possible for reasonably intelligent people to understand why Mehak Ahuja had sent a text message to her father fearing a terrorist attack on the Delhi-bound flight she was travelling in (SMS terrorises plane, March 12). For a young girl flying on her own for the first time, she must have been nervous and agitated. However, the lack of maturity in those who are prosecuting her is positively frightening. The matter has been blown completely out of proportion and a false gravitas has been imposed on it. As a precedent, this incident is going to discourage the public from reporting any suspicious activity around them.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Ananda Goswami,Coventry, UK 

 Sir It seems that Mehak Ahuja had given little thought to the SMS she had sent to her father on the flight to Delhi. The young seem to be misusing mobile phones a lot. They need to be reminded of the purpose of mobile telephony and made more responsible for what they do with their gizmos. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kushal Kumar Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir Mehak Ahuja appears to be an innocent young girl who intended to save the lives of her co-passengers on the flight. Her only crime was her misinterpretation of a few stray remarks she had overheard. Most people in her place would have been disturbed and raised an alarm. Judging from the consequences of her action, it seems that people will now never come up to report suspicious activities. The way the matter has been handled will have severe repercussions on both the professional and personal life of Mehak. Even though she has now been released on bail, reparations in some form must be made to undo the damage done by the over-zealousness of a few officials. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Sir The text message sent by Mehak Ahuja reflected an error of judgment on her part. Admittedly, Mehak had acted rashly, causing a lot of anxiety and financial loss subsequently. Her case has set a precedent. In the future, people will think twice before making such a faux pas. However, one still feels that Mehak should have been given the benefit of doubt. After all, it was a panic reaction. By putting her behind bars, the authorities reacted excessively. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.C. Tibrewala, Calcutta

 Sir By trying to prepare a strong case against Mehak Ahuja, the police have made the situation ridiculous and also shown their arrogance. Instead of sympathizing with the girl, they have come down upon her like a ton of bricks. The government has spent a lot of money in order to make people aware of the necessity to alert the authorities about a potential terror attack. When this is done, they go about trying to frame cases against the complainant. What message does this kind of extreme response send out to the public? That people should not report anything unless they are confident that they have spotted real terrorists? Mehaks case, following close to the terrorist attack on the Samjhauta Express, should have been dealt with in a more sensitive manner. After all, security measures across the country have not been flawless, if the chain of blasts and terror attacks in India are any indication.

 Yours faithfully,

Shikhar Ray, Berhampur, Murshidabad

 Sir It is unfortunate that people like Mehak Ahuja seem to have little clue as to who should be informed in case of any suspicious activity that is witnessed. Instead of confiding in her father, Mehak should have directly got in touch with the airport security. Her message naturally alarmed her father, who set off a chain of events which inconvenienced passengers and caused a huge financial loss to the airlines. The police should have let Mehak off after slapping a fine instead of putting her in jail with undertrials and criminals. The case shows that the police and the airlines are not prepared to deal with the situation. They should realize that members of the public, who are regularly exposed to horrific images of terror attacks on television, travel with a lot of apprehension and are prone to panic responses such as this.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumit Ghosal, Calcutta

 Sir The authorities seem intent on exploiting any folly committed by citizens. They are almost nonchalant to the failings on their part. Passengers who travel by air are expected to go through exhaustive, even invasive, security checks at airports. This is never considered harassment. In fact, these are considered mandatory, and passengers are supposed to cooperate with the security personnel. Despite such stringent measures, terror attacks have not been eliminated. Rather, recent incidents have shown that passengers have lost their valuables, including laptops and mobile phones, after security checks. 

 Yours faithfully,

Angana Roy Chowdhury, Calcutta

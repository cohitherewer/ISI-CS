 Letters to Editor

 Which is a greater offence?

 Sir The Bharatiya Janata Party seems to believe that offence is the best defence. It is thereby trying to counter the anti-Muslim CD controversy by staging protests and courting arrests (Jaitley thrust into heat of CD battle, April 10). But how can the BJP wash its hands of the matter by claiming to have no knowledge of the CD when party leaders themselves released it in the presence of the media? The BJP has consciously tried to incite communal passions for its political gain. Now it cannot question the authority of the Election Commission to issue it a show-cause notice. Whether the EC has the power to cancel the BJPs registration is immaterial. What is important is that some members of the party have indulged in communalism, and the party has not done anything to curb this. Instead, the party top brass is vehemently denying its responsibility. The BJPs anti-minority worldview, which is so deeply ingrained in the partys psyche, might have prompted some of its members to think that their act was legitimate. The party should do some honest soul-searching. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir First information reports were filed on April 5 against some of the BJP leaders, including Lalji Tandon and Rajnath Singh, on the instructions of EC for the circulation of a CD containing inflammatory material. This CDs content is believed to be dangerous enough to cause communal riots in India. The local leadership obviously believes that the party had lost power in UP and the Centre for not following its staunch Hindutva agenda. Which is why they have taken the initiative to whip up communal sentiments against Muslims again. The communal politics of the BJP poses threat to the life and property of Muslims in India. Events during the National Democratic Alliance rule sufficiently prove this. Let us hope that the EC will not allow the party get away with its anti-minorityism.

 Yours faithfully,

Hem Raj Jain, New Delhi

 Sir Following the FIR lodged against some of the BJP leaders in UP, the party president, Rajnath Singh, marched to the Hazratgunj police station to surrender. However, the polices refusal to arrest him put paid to the partys plans. In case of a non-bailable offence, the police necessarily have to produce the accused in court after the arrest. Had this happened, the EC would perhaps have been unable to take immediate action against the party. Since it would be difficult to prove the partys complicity in the production and distribution of the CDs, the case might even have been dismissed by the court. The party is now projecting the polices refusal to arrest Singh as a moral victory on its part and proof of its innocence. The EC should conduct a thorough investigation and punish the culprits.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir The BJP, which has disowned the release of the controversial CD, would go to any lengths to fetch votes. Even during the previous general elections, Lalji Tandon had distributed saris to poor women folk in the parliamentary constituency of A.B. Vajpayee. It led to a stampede which killed many, including children. Tandon was recently absolved by the court on the grounds that he had left the venue by the time things went out of control. L.K. Advani too has nothing but deep regrets for the fall of the Babri Masjid. The BJP has no qualms in changing its stand to save its skin. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.N. Bhagavan, Bangalore

 Sir It is preposterous to seek the derecognition of the main opposition party on the basis of a CD controversy. The move might be counter-productive in the long run. The ruckus over the FIR and the arrests that never took place have already garnered much support for both the BJP and the Samajwadi Party. In India, sympathy votes have won elections for parties and politicians. Negative publicity may work wonders for the BJP as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Parting shot

 Sir Chepuri Sri Krishnas stint at the A.K. Gopalan Bhavan, in close proximity with the red brigade, might prove beneficial both for the student of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and the Left, which is clearly confused about its current policies (IIMs Che in Red cubicle, April 8). Krishna is supposed to have been greatly influenced by Sitaram Yechurys lectures at the campus. So it is not the railway minister, Lalu Prasad, alone who is turning heads in the academia. One hopes young researchers are not discouraged by Krishnas experience with the communists.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

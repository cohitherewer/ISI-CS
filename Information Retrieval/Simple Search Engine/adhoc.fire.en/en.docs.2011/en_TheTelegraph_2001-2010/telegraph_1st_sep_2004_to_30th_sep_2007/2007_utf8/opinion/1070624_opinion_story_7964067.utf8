 DIARY

 What happens when the railways minister visits a railway station? The travellers and commuters have a tough time, of course, but they are not the only people who were cursing their luck when Lalu Prasad descended on the Patna station recently. The minister had got too used to airports, evidently, and found the standards of hygiene at the station of his hometown abominable. He called the sanitation officials and put the fear of god in them. They could see that the minister was angry, very angry. In fact, the filth around him had made Lalu Prasad so angry that he spat. And a loud, angry, forceful act it was. Obviously, the dirty Patna station makes a lot of people angry, and a lot of peoples anger makes the Patna station dirty.

 One wishes the president was named a little sooner, the whole act is getting a tad boring now. If even one candidate had a criminal record to his credit, it would have made the mediamen busy and happy. Madan Lal Khurana may have given them something to dig into. The saffron leader, whose relationship with his party is not at its sweetest at the moment, dropped a bombshell when he said not in public, of course that he is the reason why Pratibha Patil is on her way to Rashtrapati Bhavan. Khuranas argument goes thus: had he not resigned as Rajasthan governor in October, 2004, the Congress would not have pulled Patil out of political wilderness and installed her in the post. By the way, Khurana himself is in a bit of political wilderness now. Theres nothing wrong with living in hope.

 How do you know that the government of India takes its science and technology ministry seriously? By the simple fact that the scientific adviser to the government of India will now have his own scientific adviser. The appointment letter has gone out to the recently retired secretary to the ministry of environment, Prodipto Ghosh. Isnt it time the national security adviser had a security adviser of his own?

 Is Sonia Gandhi in love with the Netherlands? This is the second year in a row that she has gone on lecture trips to this country and that too at the Nexus Institute. (Wake up, all ye Indians, who have hitherto thought that nexus can only be unholy.) Those in the know of things have traced back the Dutch link to an Indian foreign service official who was once an integral part of Rajiv Gandhis famed coterie as a close friend of Satish Sharma. Dont be surprised to see Madam disclosing the details of her Indian political career to other European audiences soon.

 The nation watched and read about the fracas between the cardiac surgeon, Naresh Trehan, and the management of Escorts Hospitals. But few know the gory saga that lay behind. The newly-appointed lieutenant-governor of Delhi, Tejinder Khanna, had a vital role to play in it. It was within days of his appointment that the bosses of Fortis, which owns Escorts, decided to act against Trehan. And it was Khanna himself who instructed the police to arrest Trehan should he try to enter the hospital after his sacking. There is another little piece to the story. Khanna is also the ex-officio chairman of the Delhi Development Authority, which has pending before it several cases of unlawful allotment of land for charitable hospitals. At least two such hospitals have recently been taken over by Fortis. What happens to their pending cases will make the picture clear. In the meantime, Khanna is known to have received a piece of Sonia Gandhis mind for his suspected role in the Escorts imbroglio.

 A 15-member parliamentary committee was in Mumbai the other day to inspect the under-construction home of an industrialist which they believed was coming up on Waqf land on Altamount Road. A legal detail cropped up, and the MPs some of them with families in tow did not enter the property, but, after 10 seconds or so outside its gate, left for a tour of the city. It was later heard that the group had run up a bill of Rs 25 lakh, settled for the time being by the Maharashtra government, but to be passed on to the state Waqf board. Who cares that the board has been struggling for some time to pay its employees?

 Congressmen beware! Idolizing the first family comes with heavy penalties, as the Moradabad district chief found to his cost (someone should have told him that the angular European face of Sonia Gandhi does not go with the style of Indian calendar art). However, Madams wrath hadnt singed her kingdom yet when the Congressmen decided to celebrate Rahul Gandhis 37th birthday on June 19. In Patna, a 37-pound cake was cut and distributed among the poor to show, surely, that in India, those who do not get bread may still eat cake. Outside 10 Janpath, there was a virtual carnival, with songs and dance and cakes and sweets. The birthday boy was conspicuous by his absence though, causing a bit of embarrassment at 24 Akbar Road, where scribes wanted to know when Rahul would go back to pick up the pieces in UP. However, partymen are advised to go light on adulation for a while.

 Faltering steps

 Sir The measures taken by the Board of Control for Cricket in India to address the causes of Team Indias humiliation in the World Cup are riddled with ambivalence (Chappells Chuckle, April 8). This could have been a perfect opportunity for the top cricketing body to penalize the players more harshly in order to remind them that stardom and endorsements are secondary when it comes to representing the country at the highest level. It is also evident that the board is inclined to preserve the senior-junior divide in the team. What else can explain its decision to not scrap the existing endorsement contracts of three senior players? It is imperative that every star player in the team be asked to improve the quality of his performance and devote less time to grooming himself. If the board is really meant to control cricketers and bring up the standards of the game in India, it had better start living up to its name.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir From the steps taken by the BCCI to improve the state of Indian cricket, it seems that guru Greg has had the last laugh. Soon after his recruitment as the coach, Chappell had insisted on including younger players in the team. However, the coterie of senior players prevented him from executing his vision, most of which, ironically, seems to have been adopted by the board after his resignation. The BCCI has done the right thing by requesting Chappell to take up the job of a consultant. Chappells acceptance of the offer will do wonders to Indian cricket. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The decision of the selection committee to retain Rahul Dravid as the captain at the behest of Sharad Pawar, the BCCI president, is surprising. It was widely, and not unreasonably, expected that after his uninspiring show as the leader of the team, Dravid would relinquish his position and the mantle would go to someone younger like Yuvraj Singh. It is no longer a secret that captaincy is a burden for Dravid. This has been proved beyond doubt in the many matches that India played under him. The boards decision to showcause Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh is equally ridiculous. While the formers statement to the media was an emotional outburst, the latter merely said that the entire team supported Tendulkar. It is rather presumptuous of the BCCI to curb players rights to freedom of speech in this manner.

 Sir The BCCIs only solution to the abiding problems of Indian cricket seems to be the recruitment of a handful of coaches one for the bowlers, another for fielders, and a manager for the entire team. Now, how about a coach for the 12th man and another for disaster management? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir After considerable brainstorming in Mumbai, the BCCI think-tank has diagnosed the factors that led to Indias early exit from the World Cup: senior players with a questionable attitude and their endorsement deals. It is widely known that the board earns a lot of money through telecast rights and sponsorship. Only a fraction of this is distributed among the players. Moreover, the argument that a players performance is affected because of the time he spends in endorsing products is debatable. Sportsmen like Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Roger Federer, Ronaldinho and so on make a lot of money from endorsement deals but that has not made a difference to their showing on the field. Moreover, not all players get lucrative offers. Only those who perform consistently become marketable entities. The moment there is a dip in their performance, the endorsement offers dry up. So the BCCIs diktat to cut down on endorsements cannot be a pragmatic solution to the problems that plague Indian cricket. After all, Sachin Tendulkar was in top form only a few years back, although he was endorsing as many products then as he does these days. The BCCI has no right to deny players their right to make money, more so because it is taxable income and not wealth that goes unaccounted for. Now, on the vexed question of accountability. To whom are the players accountable? To the board and to the nation. To whom are the board officials accountable? To themselves!

 One must also question the boards decision to retain Rahul Dravid as the captain for the upcoming Bangladesh series. It is widely accepted that Dravids record as skipper has been miserable. It seems that Dravids reappointment is the result of the BCCI president succumbing to the pressure exerted by the southern lobby. The bowling and fielding coaches were also recruited from the South due to the same reason. Finally, it was ridiculous to showcause Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh for speaking to the press, when Greg Chappell got away with all the emails and SMSs that he had sent to journalists from time to time. It is shocking to note the board rewarding Chappell with a consultants role after bringing Indian cricket to disrepute. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir Indian cricketers are interested only in two things: setting individual records and earning money. Greg Chappell tried to bring some order into Indian cricket but it was a lost cause from the very beginning, thanks to the parochial attitude of those who run cricket in the country. Indian cricket is now controlled by a few powerful brands that decide which players are glamorous enough to become their ambassadors, and by extension, ensure their places in the team. It does not matter if they have played for a long time; they need not retire so long as they are able to sell the products that they endorse. A player should be judged on the basis of his present form, age and fitness, and not by the runs he made and the records that he set during his heyday. The BCCI and the players have become playthings in the hands of the corporate houses. Chappell was a stumbling block in this enterprise which is why he had to go. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

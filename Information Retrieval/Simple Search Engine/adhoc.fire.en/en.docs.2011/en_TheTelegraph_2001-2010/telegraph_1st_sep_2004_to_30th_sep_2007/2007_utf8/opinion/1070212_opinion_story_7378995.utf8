 DOCTORS AWAY

 This is, yet again, a case of Europe closing its ranks: globalization may be allowed, but only as one-way traffic. A change in British immigration laws last April had made it mandatory for non-European doctors to have work permits in order to train with the British National Health Service. The catch lies in the fact that to get this work permit, the trainee doctors employer will now have to establish that the vacancy cannot be filled by a homegrown candidate. This affects thousands of doctors from the Indian subcontinent, who are now left rather horribly in the lurch without a prospect of jobs or renewal of contracts. Most of these doctors come to Britain to sit for various qualifying examinations, the more advanced levels of which require them to go through this sort of training. The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (which includes doctors from Pakistan and Nigeria) had moved court against such a ruling, and has now lost the case. The matter had acquired an edge after a young doctor from Pakistan, stranded by this new law with immense debts back home, killed himself in Britain for not being able to find any employment.

 Asian doctors, who have been the prop of the NHS for decades, feel betrayed by the very forces of globalization that brought them to Britain in the first place. (Ironically, the NHS is planning to outsource some of its clerical work to India.) The desperation with which young doctors invest all their resources to go to Britain and find employment there also speaks of the situation in their own countries. One of the justifications that the British Home Office gives for such a law is that it would benefit the home countries by ensuring that their doctors do not leave. There might be some truth in this, although that does not take away the disingenuousness of such an argument.

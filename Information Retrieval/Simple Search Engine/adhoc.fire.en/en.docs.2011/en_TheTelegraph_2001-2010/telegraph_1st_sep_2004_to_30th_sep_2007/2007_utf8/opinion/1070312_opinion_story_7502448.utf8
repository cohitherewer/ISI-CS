 NEVER EQUAL

 Equality is difficult to achieve and sustain even in legitimate sexual relationships. But an affair between a teacher and a student is understandably taboo, given that the formal relationship between the two is defined by a sort of institutionalized inequality. So when the Supreme Court acquits a schoolteacher for having sex with his Class VII student because the sex took place outside school, then certain disturbing questions regarding the mechanisms of power within this particular relationship are unavoidable. The man was first charged with rape, but was acquitted when a trial court established that the student was older than 18 and had given consent. But this court still convicted him under Section 376B of the Indian Penal Code, which regards a public servant taking advantage of his official position with a woman who is in his custody as a sexual offence, even if there had been no rape. In this case, the apex court agreed that the teacher was a public servant, but acquitted him because the sex had not taken place within the precincts of the school but outside.

 Such a literal and limited interpretation of the responsibilities of power ignores the ubiquitous nature of such forms of power. (In fact, this teacher had allegedly threatened to fail his student if she did not consent to having sex with him.) To regard their relationship as love the moment they step out of the classroom amounts to a rather nave view of how gendered and institutionalized inequalities actually operate within human lives. Although patriarchy is a crucial context to the possibilities of such abuse, such a form of sexual coercion should be perceived and judged in gender-neutral terms. Sex between a female teacher and her male student, or the same-sex equivalent of such a situation, would be just as abusive, and the teacher does not have to be older. Simply being the teacher would make him or her more powerful even if there are no blackboards and benches anywhere in the vicinity.

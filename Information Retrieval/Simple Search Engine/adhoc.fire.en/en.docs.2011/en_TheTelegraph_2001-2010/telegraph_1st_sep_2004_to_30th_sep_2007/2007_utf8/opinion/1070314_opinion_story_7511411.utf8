The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 CRICKET FEVER

 The bonanza for cricket fans has begun. Sixteen teams will play cricket for 47 days in nine different countries spread over the Caribbean. These bewildering statistics need to be brought down to reality. Of the sixteen teams, only ten are full members of the International Cricket Council, and are considered to be serious contenders; of the nine countries playing host, only four are considered to be venues with an international reputation; of the 47 days of cricket, only a handful will produce hard-fought competitive cricket. Many matches will be little more than walkovers: this is only to be expected in a cricket tournament in which Scotland, Ireland, Holland, Canada and Bermuda are participating. These five countries have no tradition of playing top class competitive cricket. Thus there is no guarantee that all 47 days of the World Cup are going to provide unalloyed enjoyment to the lover of one- day internationals.

 The absence of continuous enjoyment over all 47 days will be compensated by the fact that as far as the top teams are concerned, this is arguably the most open World Cup. Any of the top teams could emerge triumphant. A few weeks ago, most observers would have said that nothing short of a miracle could stop Ricky Ponting and his men from doing the victory lap at the end of the finals on April 28. But today only a brave man or a blind supporter of the green caps will hazard such a prediction. The only safe prophecy is that the glorious uncertainty associated with cricket will be on display when the top teams play. The one-day variety of the game is, as all genuine cricket lovers admit, heavily tilted in favour of batsmen. This has added to the popularity of cricket because nothing excites the ordinary lover of cricket more than a flurry of fours and sixes. But one- day cricket is also an exercise in the strategy of containment. Coaches and captains will be busy devising ways to stop batsmen like Ponting, Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar to name only the three best from scoring runs and scoring them very fast. This exercise will depend on how fields are placed and the way bowling resources are used. The real cricket lover, while enjoying the exhibition of batsmanship, will also note and appreciate these finer points of the game. The World Cup thus has something to offer to lovers of cricket at various levels. The cup of joy does runneth over.

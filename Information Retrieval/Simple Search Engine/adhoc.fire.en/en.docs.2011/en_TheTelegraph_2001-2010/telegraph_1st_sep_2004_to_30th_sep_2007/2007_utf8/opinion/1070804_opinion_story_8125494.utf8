 A TURN IN 

 THE SOUTH 

 - Two geniuses and several centuries in a day 

 Ramachandra Guha

 Politics and Play

 Although I am not religious, I 

 do greatly enjoy spending time in old temples and churches 

 and mosques. When I was in Tiruchirapalli (Trichy) recently, 

 and my hosts asked what they could do for me, I asked that 

 I be taken to the Srirangam temple. This is the grandest 

 (and I think oldest) of three temples located on islands 

 in the river Cauvery. I had previously been to the other 

 two (located at Srirangapatnam and Madhyarangam respectively); 

 now I wanted to complete a hat-trick. Since I had an afternoon 

 flight back to Bangalore, I was picked up after breakfast 

 and driven to the temple. Its gopuram painted in 

 vivid colours of blue, pink and green was visible from 

 miles around. My wife, after a visit to Madurai, had come 

 back complaining of the painting of the Meenakshi temple 

 there; clearly, the epidemic was spreading.

 My escort told me that it was 

 M.G. Ramachandran who, as chief minister of Tamil Nadu, 

 had sanctioned the funds for the painting of temple gopurams 

 across the state. When we reached Srirangam we found a sign 

 put up by the Sthapathi (temple architect) who had undertaken 

 the decorations it said that these had been done according 

 to the traditional designs and specifications. This, surely, 

 was not entirely true. The original architects must have 

 used vegetable dyes, while now the stone had been washed 

 with tins and tins of enamel paint. The net result was that 

 one could not really appreciate the beauty of the sculptures 

 on the gopuram. The contrast with the lower walls, which 

 were unpainted, was striking there, the animals and deities 

 stood out in bold relief.

 However, most of the time one 

 is in a temple one looks not upwards but straight or to 

 the left and right. Srirangam is a town unto itself, with 

 several gates to go through and walls to cross before one 

 comes anywhere near the sanctum sanctorum. Although 

 it was a weekday, there were hundreds of worshippers around. 

 Flower-sellers and fruit merchants were doing brisk business. 

 Before we went to the main shrine which had a sign saying, 

 Only Hindus are Allowed we stopped at the samadhi 

 of the great thinker-reformer, Ramanuja. Here, a group of 

 Iyengar Brahmins were chanting Sanskrit verses, quite beautifully. 

 One hoped that somewhere in the complex there were also 

 the Dalits whom Ramanuja had urged to come and worship there.

 My guide had a friend who lived 

 just outside the temple walls. In his home we had some well-made 

 filter coffee, and proceeded to the airport. When we reached 

 we found that the flight I was supposed to take had been 

 cancelled. Since I was due to leave for Jaipur the next 

 day, there was nothing to do but hire a taxi to drive me 

 to Bangalore. It was a hot day (40 degrees, and climbing) 

 and I was told it would take upwards of nine hours to cover 

 the 350 kilometres to my destination.

 Resolutely, I settled into my 

 seat and commanded the driver to make a move on. Fortunately, 

 however, this was a part of India I had never seen on the 

 ground. We drove close to the Cauvery, the river to our 

 right, now visible clearly, now hidden by a clump of banana 

 or coconut trees. It was a charming country road, with neem 

 and ficus trees planted along its sides.

 At one stage, we passed a large 

 mango orchard. I had been told that it was along the banks 

 of the Cauvery, near Trichy, that one found the best specimens 

 of the mango named Himampasand. This was generally reckoned 

 to be the finest mango in the South, to our region what 

 the Alphonso is to the Konkan coast or the Langra to the 

 Indo-Gangetic plain. But judging by the name a corruption 

 of Imam-ki-pasand the fruit must originally have 

 come from the North.

 As we left the river behind us, 

 the countryside grew less lush. The fact that this was a 

 land home to many faiths was manifest all around a small 

 temple on a hill, a prayer wall in an open field, a church 

 at the end of a village street. At least in this part of 

 Tamil Nadu, the different religions co-existed more or less 

 harmoniously. One did not read of Hindu-Muslim riots here, 

 or of Christian priests being set upon by young men wielding 

 trishuls.

 Tamil Nadu appeared different 

 and distinctive in another respect the disperal of modern 

 industry. In my home state of Karnataka, factories and warehouses 

 are generally found only in or about large towns such as 

 Bangalore, Hubli and Mangalore. In parts of North India, 

 there are no factories and warehouses at all. But here, 

 in interior Tamil Nadu, industrial enterprises were spread 

 across the landscape. I passed many textile factories, some 

 units manufacturing automotive components, and one poultry 

 farm, which would more appropriately be termed a factory 

 it had thousands of chickens cooped up in a single enclosure 

 the size of a basketball stadium.

 As in some other parts of India, 

 in the middle reaches of the Cauvery watershed, the 21st 

 century co-exists with the 12th and the 13th. Signs of the 

 former were the factories along the road, as also the plentiful 

 (and massive) posters of the Tamil Nadu chief minister, 

 M. Karunanidhi, alongside his son and political heir, M.K. 

 Stalin. The most striking sign of earlier times was the 

 Namakkal fort, which we passed about two hours out of Trichy. 

 While admiring the fort, I phoned my wife, who said that 

 she remembered reading that, as a boy, Srinivasa Ramanujan 

 had liked wandering along its walls. So, in a single day, 

 I had passed through places associated with two geniuses 

 separated by several centuries, but joined by adherence 

 to a common sect (Vaishnavism) and by an (almost) common 

 name Ramanuja, the medieval preacher, and Ramanujan, the 

 modern mathematician.

 One of the joys of driving through 

 the Indian countryside is that signs of history and culture 

 are everywhere. One of the joys of doing this in middle-age 

 is that one can afford to drive or rent a car, thus to look 

 out of the window when one wishes, to stop and look more 

 closely when one wishes that too. (I am not nostalgic for 

 the many long bus journeys I made when I was a boy, when 

 I was confined to an inner seat or to standing, and when 

 I got out only when the bus driver allowed me to.)

 I arrived home in Bangalore hot 

 and tired, but happy. The arbitrariness of an airline company 

 had permitted me a privileged peep into a part of India 

 I had never really seen before. The next day I flew on to 

 Jaipur, where, after my talk was done, I hired a car to 

 take me through a very different landscape: arid, treeless, 

 magnificent forts atop hills, temples aplenty but few mosques 

 and absolutely no churches. Nor any factories either. Among 

 the compensations were the clothes on display what gorgeous 

 colours the Rajasthani men and women wear! (In Srirangam, 

 the saris the women had on were undistinguished, 

 whereas the men wore white dhotis and had their chests 

 bare.) That such different terrains and architectures and 

 cultures and languages and cuisines and cosmologies can 

 yet be part of a single country is, of course, the wonder 

 that is India.

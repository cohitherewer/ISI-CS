The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SENSE OF HISTORY

 Times of transition have always been times of conflict as well. Britain had its swing riots over the mechanization of agriculture in the 19th century. Industrialization in todays China is accompanied by a rising number of peasants revolts. But the pains of modernization are no reason to stop the inevitable process of change. The tragedy at Nandigram cast a shadow over the new initiatives for Bengals industrialization. Doubts were raised about the tragedy signalling the end of hope for Bengal. In his first public speech since the events at Nandigram, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has done well to clear the air on this. Even those who have condemned his governments messy handling of the situation at Nandigram cannot deny the importance of keeping the industrialization process alive. The chief ministers reiteration of his commitment to a chemical hub is also reassuring. There are instances elsewhere in the country, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, where new chemical hubs have transformed the economies of the areas and generated jobs for a new generation of skilled workers. Especially in times of conflict, it is important not to lose the sense of history.

 However, Mr Bhattacharjees appeal for peace and an end to political violence is another matter. There can be no doubt that violence and political instability will harm the cause of Bengals industrialization. But the first steps to peace are to be taken by his own party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Given its record of using force and violence as a political strategy, the party has to reform itself in order to win the oppositions confidence. The chief ministers admission of his own responsibility for the police brutalities at Nandigram serves this purpose only partially. The tragedy was not only an administrative failure; it was also a result of the CPI(M)s policy of forcing its will on the people. Wherever it faces opposition, resistance or defeat, the partys cadre responds with a show of force. Mr Bhattacharjee has talked since of learning some lessons from Nandigram. The most important lesson that he needs to learn is that an overreaching party machine is his worst enemy. He needs to learn to separate this machine from his administration. Bengals industrialization does not have to happen at the expense of democratic politics.

 Letters to Editor

 Shrewd calculation

 Sir India isnt Delhi(May 23) rightly points to the governments limited vision in projecting India. But behind this short-sightedness is shrewd calculation. It is financially viable to restrict major events to Delhi. These events bring in a lot of investment to the city, something Mumbai or Calcutta can only dream of. If the Asian or Commonwealth Games were held in other cities, the Centre would lose out on precious revenue. Hence Delhi continues to receive endless bounties, and has the highest per capita growth in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

 Dipankar Das, New Delhi

 Natural disaster

 Sir The dwindling population of tigers (Shed a tear for the tiger, May 24) reveals an alarming lack of awareness across India about the importance of protecting this species. To save the tiger and other wild animals is to preserve the balance of the ecosystem of which man, too, is a part. The government should prevent deforestation and unauthorized human settlement in and around the tiger reserves. Moreover, adequate number of forest guards and officers, with not just proper training but also genuine love for animals, should be deployed immediately. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Barasat

 Sir What is the point of having a reserve forest if it cannot protect the animals it is intended for? Despite the existence of such reserves all over the country, the population of the big cats has gone down drastically. Policy-makers have been too busy sorting out the environmental challenges faced by tigers. They forgot to take into account the threats posed by the human society. Moreover, policy-making cannot be based entirely upon statistics, especially given that census records have hardly made for noticeable changes. Proactive steps, not more red-tapism, would save this majestic animal.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir India was once known as the land of tigers and snakes. The rate at which the tiger population is decreasing, it would not be surprising if tigers vanished altogether in India after five years or so. The scientific reason behind preservation the importance of the ecological chain is known to every school-goer. Activists and environmentalists must act decisively rather than continue showing concern for the national animal.

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Failing health

 Sir The unfortunate death of 80-year-old Phanindranath Mandal, owing to medical negligence at the sub-divisional hospital in Uluberia, appears to be nothing short of a cold-blooded murder (Double shock in hospital, May 23). Why was an outsider asked to administer the injection when a qualified doctor and a nurse were present? Mandal was then put on oxygen support from an empty cylinder. Today, the reputation of government hospitals is such that it is thought to be a miracle if a patient survives the ordeal there and returns home cured. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir The health ministers total lack of concern for the dereliction of duty in state-run hospitals is amazing. The public is not blameless either, given their indifference to the situation. The doctor-on-duty at the Uluberia hospital, Jagannath Das, should be suspended, firstly, for allowing an outsider into the emergency ward, and secondly, for letting him give an injection to a critically-ill man. The hospital superintendent must be made answerable to the patients family and the health ministry. 

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Gupta, Bandel, Hooghly

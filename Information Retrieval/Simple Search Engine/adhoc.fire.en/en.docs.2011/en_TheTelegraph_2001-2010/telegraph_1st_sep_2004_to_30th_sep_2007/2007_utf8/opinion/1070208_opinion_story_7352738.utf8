 Letters to Editor

 Marriage and morals

 Sir In the article, Sailing on a slow boat to nowhere (Feb 1), Sumanta Sen arrives at some hasty conclusions, which do not necessarily reflect contemporary social reality. It is not correct to assume that matrimonial advertisements in vernacular dailies represent the attitude of the entire society. Many of the so-called love marriages, as opposed to arranged marriages, are inter-caste. Those who fail to meet their match in the course of their daily lives, usually advertize in vernacular newspapers. Their faith in the printed matrimonial column, rather than in similar websites and chat rooms, shows up their fundamentally orthodox character. For such conservative persons or their parents, it is only natural not to want to rock the boat. Denouncing casteism has almost become a fashion. But the fact that it persists points out that it may still be socially relevant. With the communist-backed United Progressive Alliance government going out of its way to re-inforce caste-quotas in academic institutions, casteism seems to have attained renewed importance in our society. In a democracy, we need to respect the beliefs and convictions of everyone as long as they do not hurt others. Sens vilification of middle-class Bengalis for their caste consciousness is thus uncalled for. Finally, the changes in marriage patterns in a dynamic society is too complex an issue to be dealt with in casual writings, especially in the absence of long-term demographic data.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir The institution of marriage has become a shaky one. Men are increasingly facing the rough end of it. Laws created in the name of ending violence on women have often been turned into means for harassing men. It is not easy for men to get a divorce any more. Naturally, he has to be very careful while choosing his bride. Since people from similar socio-cultural backgrounds get along with one another, choosing someone from the same community at least reduces the chances of conflict. And it is no ones business to judge what kind of partner a person may choose. Sumanta Sen has insulted divorced men who want to remarry by suggesting that they might be looking for fresh dowry. What about those women looking for a well-established groom? 

 Yours faithfully,

Soumendra Datta, Calcutta

 Sir Sumanta Sens article on Bengali matrimonial preferences tempts me to relate a personal incident. As a Bengali army officer eagerly looking for a bride in the early Seventies, I met a number of Bengali families who were as keen on finding suitable grooms. In most cases, I was asked two specific questions after the usual round of refreshments: Do you drink? and Will there be a war? On replying in the affirmative to both questions, I used to be politely shown the door. Ultimately, I did the most pragmatic thing I married a Bengali army officers daughter.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir While I agree with most of the things Sumanta Sen says, I find his jibe at Rabindranath Tagore unacceptable. Tagore did ensure that his sons-in-law came from the Brahmo Samaj. But this decision was influenced to a large extent by the fact that in those days, the relations between the Brahmo Samaj and the mainstream Hindu community was severely strained. The Brahmos were regarded as heretics for their monotheism and opposition to idol- worship. Tagores affiliation with the Brahmo Samaj, along with his Pirali background, might have exposed his daughters to the risk of ill-treatment and humiliation by their in-laws if they had been married outside the Samaj. The decisions and activities of great men should not be judged as they are but in the context of the time they lived in. Tagore was undoubtedly much more progressive and liberal than most of his contemporaries, even if the social strictures of his time did not always let him practice what he preached. To equate him with the superstitious, shallow Bengali middle class of today is both foolish and infuriating.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhirup Mascharak, Durgapur

 Sir To denigrate ones own community is seen as a way of expressing ones liberalism these days. People like Sumanta Sen, armed with Western ideas of social and political correctness, look at social behaviour in a narrow, reductionist way. No other race feels so good about pulling down their bre- thren as Bengalis do. Sen could learn a few things from the Japanese or the Europeans.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir Ones preferences in affinal relationships hardly indicate ones attitude towards casteism, just as matrimonial advertisements in newspapers cannot be representative of an entire societys view on matrimony. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Calcutta

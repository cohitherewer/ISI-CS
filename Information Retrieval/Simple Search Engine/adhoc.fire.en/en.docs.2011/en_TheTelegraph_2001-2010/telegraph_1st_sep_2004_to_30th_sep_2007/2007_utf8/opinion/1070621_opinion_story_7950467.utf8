The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A SHINY, HAPPY NATION

 PEOPLE LIKE US

 That the Japanese are boring is only a myth

 Even as the bus winded its way to Tokyo city from the airport, I was struck by what I saw on the streets. It was a Monday evening, Tokyo was bathed in a strange grey light, and the people men in their dour suits and women in equally dull shades hurried home, their faces serious and grim. Had someone died, I wondered? An actor, a sumo star, or even the prime minister? But the Japanese are like this only, a fellow Indian journalist whispered. They never laugh, wear a single expression and commit suicide in droves, he added knowingly.

 But first impressions are seldom right. In the course of our two-week stay, we found out that the Japanese, apart from being charming, also had a sense of humour and were not entirely expressionless.

 At the government office in rainy, bitterly cold Osaka, the mayor apologized profusely for his offices failure to control the weather. It dawned on us that he had cracked a joke. It wasnt spectacularly funny, but he was at least trying to be cheerful.

 A Japanese face is no longer deadpan during a game of soccer or sumo. At the Saitama stadium, my Japanese colleague, efficient and business-like throughout the metro ride, was suddenly transformed into a muttering, fist-clenching football fan. Similarly, the crowd at the Kokugikan in Ryogoku went ecstatic and threw red cushions on to the ring when Asashoryu, the reigning sumo champion, lost a match. 

 And then, there are robots. Or lobots, as our interpreter pronounced it. At Vstone, a robotics factory, a banshee-like wail rose from the women visitors everytime a robot made an appearance. Okay, perhaps it wasnt a wail. But it was certainly an expression of adulation. There could be no doubt about that.

 I also saw anger, only once. This happened after two of us nearly missed a our train to Hiroshima because we had spent a long time chatting in the smoking room. We hurried to the station where we met our contact. She didnt say a word but her face had a dangerous, red tint. 

 There were tears as well. The day our host families came to see us off before we left for Hamamatsu, they was a lot of laughter, but I also saw this little girl, all of six, wiping her eyes even as her parents led her to their car.

 At the Suzuki factory in Shizuoka, I asked the manager whether he expected sales to dip after the Tatas launched their one-lakh car. He only raised his nearly-nonexistent brows but said nothing. Then, in a low voice, with his eyebrows still raised, he said, A one-lakh car? Is that possible? Thats when I realized that the Japanese could be surprised as well.

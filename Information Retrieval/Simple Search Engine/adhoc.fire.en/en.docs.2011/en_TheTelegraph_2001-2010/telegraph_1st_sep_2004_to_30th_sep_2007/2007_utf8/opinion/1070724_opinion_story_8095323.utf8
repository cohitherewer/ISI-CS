 RUPEE ON THE RISE 

 - Two ways of bailing out exporters 

 Bhaskar Dutta

 A couple of months ago, one could 

 not open a newspaper or magazine without coming across some 

 reference to the raging inflation. The Central government 

 and the Reserve Bank of India tried to control the price 

 rise with a variety of policy instruments, including some, 

 which were potentially inimical to growth. However, the 

 rate of inflation continued to persist above 6 per cent. 

 Fortunately, seasonal factors came to the rescue in the 

 form of an increased supply of agricultural commodities. 

 Prices of several food items fell and helped to bring down 

 the rate of inflation to more tolerable levels. This brought 

 much-needed relief to the finance ministry and the RBI bigwigs.

 Unfortunately, the relief has 

 been short-lived. The steady appreciation in the external 

 value of the rupee is now threatening to cause sleepless 

 nights to the same set of officials as well as to exporters. 

 The rupee has been rising against all the major currencies 

 the dollar, pound sterling and the euro. The global weakness 

 of the dollar has meant that the appreciation of the rupee 

 against the dollar has been particularly alarming with the 

 rupee recording an 8 per cent appreciation vis--vis 

 the dollar. 

 Indian exporters earn their revenues 

 in foreign exchange. And unless an industry is highly import-intensive, 

 the bulk of its costs are incurred in rupees. So, every 

 increase in the external value of the rupee means a corresponding 

 drop in their net revenues. The sharp setback to the export 

 industry comes just when the industry was being talked about 

 as one of the leading engines of growth for the overall 

 Indian economy. Not surprisingly, both the finance and commerce 

 ministers have been talking about the need for remedial 

 measures to restore profitability of the export sector. 

 The government has two broad sets 

 of options available. It, or more correctly the RBI, can 

 refrain from intervention in the foreign exchange market, 

 but use micro policies specifically directed to boost 

 profitability of the export industries. Alternatively, it 

 can take the macro route namely, tackle the problem 

 at its source by reversing or at least controlling the appreciation 

 of the rupee through intervention in the foreign exchange 

 market. Of course, it can avoid either extreme by adopting 

 a mix of the two sets of policies. 

 The micro route has its attractions. 

 A mix of duty drawbacks and export subsidies in some form 

 or the other will counteract the fall in net revenues due 

 to the rupee appreciation. At the same time, the appreciating 

 rupee reduces the price of imported goods and so has a beneficial 

 impact on the level of prices. However, as economists are 

 fond of pointing out, there is no free lunch. Of course, 

 the government has to finance the duty drawbacks and export 

 subsidies, and this acts as a direct cost. 

 There is also a more subtle indirect 

 cost. The duty drawbacks and subsidies distort relative 

 prices firms may be tempted to enter the export sector 

 simply in order to take advantage of the package of incentives 

 even if their comparative advantage lies elsewhere. This 

 tendency can have deleterious effects on the overall efficiency 

 of the economy. That is why it is important to ensure that 

 such schemes are only of short duration. 

 What about macroeconomic policies? 

 At the risk of gross oversimplification, the scope for appropriate 

 macroeconomic policies in this context is heavily influenced 

 by the relative priority that the government gives to three 

 related objectives. There is first the need to ensure some 

 degree of price stability. The second objective is to maintain 

 conditions in the domestic economy that are conducive to 

 growth. Finally, there is also the need to maintain stable 

 exchange rates. Macroeconomic policy-making would be considerably 

 simpler if these three objectives were mutually compatible. 

 Unfortunately, they are not at least, not always.

 The proximate cause for the appreciating 

 rupee is the steep and continuing rise in the inflow of 

 foreign exchange into the country. Until recently, the performance 

 of Indian exporters was exemplary, with the rate of growth 

 touching almost 30 per cent. Indeed, the economy actually 

 achieved a current account surplus a rare event for the 

 Indian economy. This was complemented by large inflows of 

 foreign exchange for investment in the stock market. 

 Despite several attempts by the 

 government to encourage the outflow of foreign exchange, 

 there has been a large and steadily increasing net inflow 

 of foreign exchange. This translates into an excess demand 

 for rupees. Like any other good or service, the excess demand 

 for rupees results in an increase in the price of the rupee. 

 Of course, monetary authorities 

 need not be silent spectators the RBI can and often does 

 intervene in the foreign-exchange market. It can reduce 

 the excess demand for rupees by buying up foreign exchange. 

 The cost of RBI intervention is an increase in domestic 

 money supply. If the scale of intervention is large, then 

 this could mean a significant increase in liquidity. Unless 

 the RBI takes any further steps, the excess liquidity can 

 result in a substantial increase in inflationary pressures.

 That is why the Central bank typically 

 adopts simultaneous steps to reduce money supply. It can 

 try to put a lid on inflationary pressures by following 

 tight money policies. For instance, the RBI can sell government 

 securities in its portfolio in the domestic market. The 

 RBI can withdraw the proceeds obtained from such sales from 

 circulation, so as to contract the supply of money in the 

 economy. However, there are limits to the volume of government 

 securities that the public is willing to buy. Also, tight 

 money policies, if pursued too vigorously, may constrain 

 credit expansion so much that industry can be starved of 

 funds. Thus, the Central bank and the government are faced 

 with a trade-off between growth and inflation. 

 The RBI has also been incurring 

 a loss whenever it undertakes these open-market operations. 

 This is because the interest cost of the securities that 

 it sells to the public far exceeds the returns that it gets 

 on the foreign exchange deposits held by it. But perhaps 

 the RBI has been too conservative and risk-averse in its 

 investment decisions. It goes in for absolutely safe investments 

 that promise very low rates of return.

 The Chinese government has accumulated 

 huge stocks of foreign exchange because its economy has 

 been running up very large surpluses in its current account 

 over several years. Newspapers report that the Chinese have 

 struck a deal with a big US financial house, which will 

 buy foreign assets on behalf of the Chinese government. 

 China has adopted this strategy in order to increase earnings 

 on its foreign-exchange deposits. Perhaps, the RBI can follow 

 the same strategy. 

 What weights should the RBI attach 

 to the different priorities? The current relatively low 

 rate of inflation has given it a degree of freedom that 

 it did not have even a few weeks ago. Perhaps, the time 

 is appropriate for the RBI to intervene in the foreign-exchange 

 market, but not attempt to control the increase in domestic 

 liquidity completely. This may help exporters and promote 

 growth, but possibly at the cost of a slight increase in 

 inflation.

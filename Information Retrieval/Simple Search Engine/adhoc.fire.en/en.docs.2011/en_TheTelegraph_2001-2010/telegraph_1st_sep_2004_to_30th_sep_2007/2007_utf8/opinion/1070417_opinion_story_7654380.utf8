 MISSING LINK

 Form is always more important than content in mass politics. The sooner a politician understands this, the faster he finds his role in politics. It happened to Mahatma Gandhi, who realized that he needed to project an image of himself in order to lead Indias freedom movement. The image of the leader as the fakir eminently suited his purpose. Mr Rahul Gandhi seems to be attempting something similar for himself during the campaign for the elections in Uttar Pradesh. His statements on the demolition of the Babri Masjid and on the Gandhi familys role in dividing Pakistan are remarkable more for the form than for the content. The important thing for him is not the factual truth or the lack of it in these statements. What matters is that the strategy seems to have worked well for Mr Gandhi. It has helped him and the Congress bounce back to the centrestage of the campaign. It would be nave to think that he or his party did not anticipate the possible reaction to his statements. If the otherwise mild-mannered, soft-spoken young man has sparked controversies with his loaded remarks, it can only be part of a calibrated strategy. This impression is strengthened by the fact that the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, too has done his bit for the making of Mr Gandhis image. 

 How much the strategy helps Mr Gandhi or the Congress in the elections in UP is another matter, though. The Congress is so far behind the other contenders for power in UP that Mr Gandhi alone cannot dramatically change things. But the elections are not merely about winning the seat of power in Lucknow. The aftermath of the polls may see interesting realignments of political forces at the national level. These will go a long way in deciding the positions of the parties in the run-up to the election of a new president. That is why success or failure in UP is not half as important to the Congress as the launching of Mr Gandhi as the leader-in-waiting. Mr Gandhis statement on the Babri Masjid is apparently aimed at regaining the Muslim vote for his party. His remark on the Bangladesh war of 1971 is clearly directed at Hindu voters. But the ultimate aim that his spin doctors probably have in mind is much larger. They are using the UP polls to try and re-link Indias political destiny with the Gandhi family.

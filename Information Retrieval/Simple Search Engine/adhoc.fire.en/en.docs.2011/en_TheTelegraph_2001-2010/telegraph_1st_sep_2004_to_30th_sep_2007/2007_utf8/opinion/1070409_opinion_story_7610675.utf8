 Another one bites the dust

 The departed 

Sir The uncertainty surrounding Greg Chappells future as the coach of the Indian team has finally been resolved (Chappell chucks it, April 5). Under the circumstances, Chappell did the right thing by quitting. In all probability, the Board of Control for Cricket in India would not have extended his contract. Therefore, Chappell has done what any self-respecting individual would do in his position. Some of the senior members in the Indian team should also follow Chappells lead in the interest of Indian cricket, but all of us know that this is not going to happen. Chappell has, indeed, achieved some miraculous results during his brief tenure as coach. For instance, under him, India won a test series in the West Indies after ages. However, the most important message that he conveyed to the players was that no one is indispensable and that performance alone should merit selection. This, incidentally, is one of the reasons why some of the players are upset with him. 

 The ideas presented by Chappell are unheard of in India, where players are put before the team. The results are there for all to see. Chappell has gone and the board will be deliberating over the choice of a new coach soon. It is being reported that the BCCI is thinking of people like John Buchanan, Steve Waugh, and Dav Whatmore as possible successors. But before it decides to hand over the reins to a new coach, the board should ask itself whether it is prepared to go through another round of player discontent. It is well-known that foreign coaches, especially Australians, give more importance to performance than seniority. This is one of the reasons for Australias success in world cricket. One can immediately recall the axing of Steve Waugh from the Australian one-day squad. How many of us in India can think of an Indian team without Sachin Tendulkar, even though he has not been in the best of form over the past couple of years? 

 The board must be honest with itself before it decides on who will succeed Chappell. It would do Indian cricket a service if the board decides to take remedial action on the basis of the suggestions made by Chappell in his final report. 

 Yours faithfully,

Golokbehari Munda, Melbourne, Australia

 Sir Greg Chappell, the most controversial coach India has ever had, has called it quits. Some say that Chappell was a great cricketer but a poor manager. This, however, is not entirely true. During his stint in India, Chappell has managed to use players and the media alike to his advantage. The tables were turned when Sachin Tendulkar expressed his disappointment with the coach, forcing Chappell to step down. However, it must be said that Chappell planned his exit to perfection. In his resignation letter, he thanked the players, the support staff and the board members for their cooperation, perhaps hoping that it will help him part on good terms. 

 On its part, the BCCI should also do its bit and organize a farewell for this controversial coach. He had tried his best to improve things but things did not quite work out for him. One hopes he will be successful as a coach with some other team later in his career. 

 Yours faithfully

 Sir More often than not, Indian players, when asked to explain their poor showing in a tournament, start looking for scapegoats. Greg Chappell, who recently gave up his job as the coach of the Indian team, seems to have mastered this art from the players. His comments on the senior players are in very bad taste and were intended to create divisions in the team. Chappell should not have acted in this manner, even though he may have made up his mind to resign. One also fails to understand why Sharad Pawar decided to offer the Australian a post in the National Cricket Academy. Does Pawar not know that this man had caused irreparable damage to Indian cricket? 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat,Bardez, Goa 

 Sir The resignation of Greg Chappell was not surprising, considering his strained relationship with some of the players in the Indian team. In fact, what is surprising is that the BCCI president, the selection committee as well as Rahul Dravid and the players have not followed in Chappells footsteps and put in their papers. Indian cricket is certainly in trouble, and inept politicians and administrators must take the blame. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and K.P.S. Gill ruined football and hockey. Now, Sharad Pawar has decided to do the same to cricket. Indias revival in cricket depends on the following factors: Pawar should resign from his post; the entire team, including the captain, should be selected afresh, based on the performance of players in domestic tournaments. Moreover, there is no real need for a foreign coach. At the most, the team requires a technical director who is also a shrewd strategist.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Truth to tell

 Sir Your editorial, The importance of restraint (Mar17), on the governors reaction to the police firing in Nandigram was not quite fair. He has not blotted his copybook, nor does he suffer from the burden of impotence. The governor should act as the keeper of the states conscience and when the need arises, as in the present case, he does not have to be a spectator and can speak his mind and express his anguish. He is the constitutional head of the State and though he is guided by the advice of the council of ministers, he is not precluded from voicing his disapproval. Should he not speak when brutal police killings take place? 

 You say he should have acted like Krishna but chances are that if he didnt do anything, he would have been accused of being a Nero or, since you refer to the Mahabharata, like Dhritarashtra. And the analogy with the British monarch in The Queen doesnt hold in this instance it is not a question of Queen Elizabeths behaviour as depicted in the film, which needed remedying according to the prime minister its the state administration in West Bengal, which has erred and that failure needs to be indicted. And who better than a concerned governor to do it?

 On the other relevant point you have raised about judicial activism and suo motu pronouncements, it would be appropriate for the legislature and the executive to ponder their failure it is this which compels the judiciary to become activist. If the legislature and the executive conducted themselves well and with dignity, there wouldnt be an issue of encroachment and the judiciary would not need to be proactive.

 Yours faithfully,

Manoj Mohanka, Calcutta

 Sir The chiding of the governor, Gopal Krishna Gandhi, cannot be supported. His reaction came after he visited the large number of seriously-injured villagers in Nandigram. He was shocked by the barbarity and vengefulness of the police force which had gone berserk. How can we so easily judge the spontaneous reactions of a sensitive and civilized man? Had he uttered a few of the platitudes that are usually said on such occasions, ascribing more value to the form than the content, surely he would have been considered a good governor with a clean record book. But, no doubt, he would be less of a human being in our eyes then. Let us hope we have more such humane, cultured and apolitical governors in this country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shyamal K. Sinha, Calcutta

 Sir With reference to Gandhis Gandhigiri to woo Halim (Mar 24), I would like to point out that the governor was constitutionally correct in expressing cold horror at the police firing in Nandigram. He also expressed anguish over the starvation deaths in the North Bengal tea gardens.The governor is a man of letters and a good administrator and does no politics, unlike the governors of some other states who are politicians of some colour or the other. It is high time the Communist Party of India (Marxist) realizes that its blunders have dented the partys popularity. Perhaps, a bit of soul-searching is necessary so that Left leaders do not behave like dictators furthering the cause of capitalists. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir I have been following the Nandigram saga in four Bengali TV channels and three newspapers, including your online edition. Two of the channels have lost all pretence of being independent news channels and their reportage is best ignored. However, amidst all the blood-curdling statements flying all over and around Nandigram, your March 17 editorial did well to draw attention to the constitutional proprieties of the governor. Gopal Krishna Gandhi should have remembered that he is the constitutional head of the state and therefore above party politics. No matter what his personal feelings were, shouldnt he have asked for a report from the chief minister before echoing, unwittingly, the statements of the opposition parties? 

 The governor committed another error during this particular episode. He chose to overlook the fact that the government has the sole jurisdiction over and is responsibility for the whole of the state, and, so, has the right to use force to bring a disturbed area back under constitutional administration. Arguably, the police action in Nandigram was excessive, but surely, the governor could have ordered the government to conduct a judicial inquiry as suggested by you. However, the government must be careful not to use a judicial platform to bolster a particular political view. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asim Majumdar, Mumbai

 Sir I am a reader of The Telegraph for a couple of decades and had hardly anything to complain about its journalistic standards. But recently, I am feeling a little confused by some of your reports and editorials with respect to the incidents in Nandigram. Your special correspondent lauded the actions of Gopal Krishna Gandhi unequivocally (Model governor deals blow without parallel, Mar 16). He writes, Gandhi became the first governor in 30 years of the Left Front rule to indict the government within the constitutional norms. The very next day, your editorial condemned the governor for his unconstitutional behaviour. If you disagree with your correspondent and think he is wrong, then you should express regret and withdraw the report as it contradicts your editorial policy. But if you think that both of you are right, then you leave readers utterly confused.

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 VALUING LIFE

 Sunday mornings accident on Park Street shows that ensuring physical safety in public places requires something like an art of the possible, at its most grimly challenging. The word, accident, is absurdly inadequate as a description of 24-year-old Aftab Hussain Ansaris death. It is a coincidence that was unspeakably tragic. But could it not have been prevented? And that is where McDonalds Indias stringent global safety standards and fire safety norms have to be questioned and re-examined. After all, the fixing of standards and norms assumes a possible, though not always imaginable, gap between the prescribed and the practised. But could the air-conditioning not have been maintained better? And could the injured not have been given better emergency treatment than what SSKM Hospital offers? In a deeply unequal society, those whose lives are valued least often do the most physically demanding, risky and unpleasant jobs. These are also the people who are least aware of their rights and entitlements with regard to compensation and safety standards in the workplace. An independent inquiry would have to determine the extent to which this is applicable to the McDonalds set-up in Calcutta.

 Ensuring safety is ultimately about valuing human lives. With this in mind, it might yield disturbing results if one were to ask how safe Calcutta actually is, and who are responsible for keeping it safe. Think of any of its frequently used public places: the Metro, malls, restaurants, multiplexes, busy street-crossings, markets, factories, office buildings. How well equipped and prepared are these places to tackle accidents and unpredictable turns of event? To what extent should the public be aware of, and alert to, what they could demand by way of standards? This is both a question of knowledge and technology and of attitude and principle. Indian cities are developing rapidly. The freeing of the market will create different kinds of spaces, urban structures combining architecture and technology that will elicit different technical, legal and civic standards to be fixed and maintained. A country of more than a billion people is bound to have a whole range of attitudes to risk and danger and to the value of human life. To be responsible and accountable becomes that much more challenging in such a scenario.

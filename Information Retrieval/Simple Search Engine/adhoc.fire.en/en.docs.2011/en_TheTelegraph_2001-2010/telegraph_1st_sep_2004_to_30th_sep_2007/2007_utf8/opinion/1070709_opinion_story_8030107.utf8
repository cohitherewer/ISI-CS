 GANDHIS LETTER 

 - A whole history of the making of Gandhi-in-India awaits 

 retrieval 

 Shahid Amin

 The successful exertion by the 

 government of India to stymie the auction in London of a 

 letter written by Mahatma Gandhi has created quite a stir. 

 The facts of the case are of great intrinsic interest: the 

 letter was written by Gandhi in the pre-dawn hours as 

 was his wont just two weeks before his assassination. 

 As with much else that he did in the last months of his 

 life, this letter was apiece with his strenuous efforts 

 to maintain sanity in the capital city, witnessing a haemorrhaging 

 of its Muslim population by death and flight; it was simultaneously 

 a plea for linguistic and orthographic tolerance a faint 

 voice, but rising above the din, against the malice and 

 intoleranceof the opponents of the Urdu script. 

 The Collected Works of Mahatma 

 Gandhi reproduce a full paraphrase, but not an actual 

 translation of the letter. Six hours later, at 11.30 am 

 on January 18, 1948, a motley delegation led by the president 

 of the Congress, and comprising the representatives of the 

 Hindu Mahasabha, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Jamiat-ul-Ulema, 

 prominent Muslims of Delhi along with the citys adminstrative 

 officers, and the high commissioner of Pakistan, read out 

 a seven-point declaration, written in Urdu and Devanagari 

 scripts at Gandhijis insistence, to the fasting 

 Mahatma at Birla House. Muslims will be able to move about 

 in Subzimandi, Karol Bagh, Paharganj and other localities 

 just as they could in the past, the signatories averred, 

 bloodying the contours of the mohallas I drive through 

 en route my sons school. We shall not object to 

 the return to Delhi of Muslims who have migrated from here, 

 the pledge-takers solemnly affirmed, ending with an artless 

 plea to Mahatmaji to believe us and to give up his fast. 

 Gandhi believed them and accepted a glass of juice from 

 Maulana Azad: he was so weak that what he told this small 

 delegation had to be repeated aloud by Pyrelal and Sushila 

 Nayyar. 

 There is then a heightened poignancy 

 to everything that Gandhi said or wrote in the last month 

 of his life, which seems to have been lost in laying claim 

 to each and every piece of memorabilia associated with the 

 Father of the Nation. Interesting facts have come to light: 

 that Gandhis typist walked away with a box-full of his 

 last-days letters, that this trove was spirited out of 

 India, and some of the effects reclaimed by diligent diplomats 

 in the recent past. Extracts from the letter have appeared 

 in the press, with the news of its expected auction-price 

 dwarfing the significance of its contents. Its newsworthiness 

 seems to lie in the successful diplomatic pressure exerted 

 by our high commission in London, and the willingness of 

 the ministry of culture to rewrite the rules about government 

 making bids at auctions, in the interest of national self-esteem: 

 a reminder, that we have not forgotten Mahatma Gandhi 

 the greatest brand-ambassador for India (in the admens 

 language) that ever walked this earth, in the words of 

 Albert Einstein. The point, however, is not that we have 

 forgotten the greatest Indian teacher of all times, as 

 Professor Mohammad Habib called him in his presidential 

 address to the Indian History Congress a month before the 

 tees janvari assassination. It is that we no longer 

 routinely commemorate him, as we did in the past. 

 For Indias midnight children, 

 those born in a freshly-partitioned and free Hindustan, 

 Gandhi and Nehru represented the two facets of adolescent, 

 post-colonial pride. We knew from our text books that the 

 young Gandhi had refused to cheat at school as his teacher 

 had nudged-and-winked him to copy the correct spelling of 

 kettle, so as to present the visiting inspector with a 

 class of word-perfect spellers. We could almost hear the 

 goat which kid Mohandas had consumed with a friend (to be 

 like the mighty Englishman/Because being a meat-eater/ 

 He is five cubits tall), bleating normatively inside young 

 Gandhi. We awaited with solemn, juvenile eagerness the two 

 minute break from all scholarly activity at 11 am on Martyrs 

 Day 30th January, when Gandhi was gunned down that evening 

 at Tees-Janvari Marg in Lutyens Delhi. 

 But every subsequent national 

 commemoration of the Father of the Nation rightly required 

 that we remembered the Mahatma outside the disaggregated 

 space of families huddled over an evening cup of tea. It 

 must have been Nehrus idea, that even if mildly anachronistic, 

 individual Indians stand up in non-familial groups, wherever 

 they were at offices, schools, colleges, factories, not 

 at 5.17 pm but at 11 am in silent tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. 

 A siren used to go off in the city to mark the duration 

 of that two-minute commemoration, the only time that our 

 individual watches were overtaken by the national time that 

 the assassinated Bapu had forged into being. This routinized 

 memorialization seems to have fallen through the empty time 

 of our recent past: perhaps there is a file, signed by a 

 relevant joint secretary, authorizing this lapse (with appropriate 

 reasoning), but unlikely, as with so much of official paper, 

 to be made available to a future historian. 

 Which brings me to the question 

 of the updating of the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi, 

 the CWMG as it is known to historians in the trade. 

 The 100 volumes of the Collected Works, published 

 between 1956 and 1994, are a mammoth product of post-independence 

 historical scholarship. Between 1998 and 2001, unknown editors 

 recast the original volumes, deleting a whole lot of speeches, 

 even letters, which did not seem to be authentic; a new 

 set and a CD were hurriedly pushed through by the National 

 Democratic Alliance government. The gratuitous violence 

 of this exercise by anonymous vandal-editors was highlighted 

 by scholars like Tridip Suhrud, and it appears that the 

 original set of volumes is being reprinted. 

 But that still calls for additions 

 to the corpus of newly-discovered material, mostly in the 

 shape of Gandhis speeches delivered in small towns, or 

 at railway stations, specially during his triumphant tour 

 in the winter of 1920-21. These were reported either in 

 local newspapers, or scribbled in CID scrapbooks and printed 

 in police reports. By what touchstone of authenticity are 

 we going to exclude forever Gandhis speeches delivered 

 in end-1920-early 1921 at centres of a powerful peasant 

 movement in central Uttar Pradesh, or at the Chauri Chaura 

 railway station, a year before that violent confrontation 

 of February 4, 1922? 

 And would it not make sense for 

 the State to spend some of the 150 crores of rupees earmarked 

 for official commemoration of the Freedom Struggle, on 

 publishing the 4000-odd depositions made by peasants to 

 Gandhis lieutenants, including Babu Rajendra Prasad, detailing 

 the oppression suffered in the dehats of indigo planters 

 in Champaran district of north Bihar? For just as his deftly 

 defiant letters to the Champaran officials allow us to study 

 up close the very making of Gandhi-in-India, it is the peasants 

 eagerness in deposing before his unofficial inquiry that 

 went into the making of both that famous satyagraha 

 and of Mahatma Gandhi himself. 

 In this gala year of anniversaries, 

 the peasants of 1917 North Bihar need not remain forever 

 the anonymous masses who also ran for Our Freedom. True, 

 their humble petitions, were these to reach Christies, 

 would not create an auctioners stir, as did recently that 

 letter of Gandhi. But Champaran, April 1917 and Delhi, January 

 1948 are not that far apart in space and time, as the auction 

 market in London may suggest at first sight.

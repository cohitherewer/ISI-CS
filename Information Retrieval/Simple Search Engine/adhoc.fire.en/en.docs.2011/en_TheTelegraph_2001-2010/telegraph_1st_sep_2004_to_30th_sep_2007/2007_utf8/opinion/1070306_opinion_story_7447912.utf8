 Unwelcome attention

 Sir It is difficult to understand why members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) became unduly agitated at the visit of the US consul-general, Henry V. Jardine, to the office of the general-secretary of the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind, Siddiqullah Chowdhury (US steps on land mine, Feb 25). It is not unusual for diplomats to visit the offices of political organizations. The sovereignty of the state can hardly be said to have been attacked by the visit, as claimed by a member of the CPI(M) central committee. Such a reaction from party members only reveals their discomfort about the way in which their party is handling the issue of land acquisition. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir The ruling party has responded to the US consul-generals meeting with Siddiqullah Chowdhury in a most unseemly manner. The real cause of the outburst is not so much the alleged interference of the United States of America in the internal affairs of Bengal, but the fact that the Jamait had supported the Trinamool Congress against the forcible eviction of farmers in Singur and Nandigram. Had the Jamait toed the CPI(M) line instead, Jardines visit would perhaps have been welcomed by the party. The party cadre should do some honest soul-searching. That will help them realize the double standards they are adopting on the problem of industrialization. If the CPI(M) is so wary of US intervention, why is it permitting multinational companies to set up industrial units in the state? 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir The CPI(M) was justifiably troubled over Henry V. Jardines trip to the Jamait Ulema-i-Hinds office, especially since the latter has been accused of heightening communal tension over the question of industrialization. As it is, the state government is trying its best to settle the matter as soon as possible. It can do without the US consul-generals unwelcome attention. The US already stands accused of worsening the situation in Iraq by its interference. It deserves to be squarely snubbed before it does anything that will add fuel to the fire already raging in West Bengal. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Though the US consulate claims that the consul-generals meeting with Chowdhury is a part of its Muslim outreach programme, one cannot but be suspicious of the move. The turmoil will intensify if the US colludes with the Jamait to hit out at the state. Since the US is forever ready to exploit any weakness of developing nations to its advantage, the CPI(M) has every reason to be distrustful of the visit. However, the protesters could have shown their disapproval in a more civilized manner than besieging the Jamaits office when Jardine was there. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Kumar, Calcutta 

 Question of answers

 Difficult question 

Sir After the Madhyamik question papers were found riddled with mistakes, the president of the West Bengal board of secondary education, Ujwal Basu, said that the board will ensure that students do not suffer (Blunders again in Madhyamik papers, Feb 25). His statement is symptomatic of the apathy that has crippled the states education system. Basus assurance cannot be any apology for the errors in the questions. More so, because this is not the first time that such errors have crept into questions set for the examination. The continued appearance of mistakes raises doubts about the competence of the men in charge. One feels pity for the students whose future is decided by men who cannot even set a question right. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Ujwal Basu has tried to deflect attention from the blunders in the Madhyamik question papers by commenting that the students will not be adversely affected by them. There cannot be any question of the students suffering since the fault lies entirely with the board. It is strange that people who cannot differentiate between hormones and vitamins, or between artery and vein, are given the task of setting question papers. One feels alarmed at the thought that these men impart education as teachers. The education system in West Bengal has become thoroughly corrupt because of the nepotism among ministers in charge. In most cases, only those professing allegiance to the ruling party bag the job of a teacher, irrespective of the requisite qualifications. One despairs for the children under their care.

 Yours faithfully,

Bappaditya Pal, Calcutta 

 Parting shot

 Sir One wonders how the ministry of urban development could declare that the performance of Bengal in the urban renewal mission is better than that of all other states (Delhi pat for Buddha drive, Feb 21). Though Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has been found to be most prompt, most rigorous and most sincere in its attempts to urbanize Calcutta, the citys residents would beg to differ. Housing, drinking water, sewage and traffic the areas in which Calcutta is supposed to have excelled are precisely those which are most mismanaged. Despite appeals, the government has failed to make autorickshaws run on LPG or control air pollution. Not a single flyover constructed in the last few decades has been successful in reducing traffic congestion. Hawkers continue to encroach the footpaths, with due encouragement from the mayor of Calcutta. As for drainage, a drizzle invariably floods the city. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Striking hard

 Sir In Patchwork solutions (Feb 21), K.P. Nayar mentions that for the Pakistani establishment, Kashmir is not the disease, it is only a symptom. For them, the disease is India itself. He goes on to surmise that this is because of the Pakistanis continuing belief in the two-nation theory. However, rather than the two-nation theory, it is still Kashmir, particularly Pakistans belated realization of the fallacy of having demanded it in the first place, that skews its relations with India. Faced with an ominous future, given the sudden cooling off of relations with America, Pakistans effort has been to inflict as much damage as possible on India. The nation-state founded on the basis of religion is on its way to self-destruction. A similar fate befell the former Soviet Union. Perhaps it is time Pakistan made up its mind on whether to persist with its folly or rebuild itself on a more solid foundation.

 Yours faithfully,

V.P. Singha, Calcutta

 Sir What the bomb blasts on the Samjhauta Express intended to achieve by killing civilians will remain a mystery. If the aim was to sow discord and derail the peace process, both the Indian and Pakistan governments have made it clear that such dastardly deeds will not be allowed to stand in the way of a process to which they are committed. In fact, even the train service continues to run on schedule. Unlike what happened after the Mumbai train blasts in July last year, no responsible person in the Indian government has accused Pakistan for the crime. Since a majority of the casualties are Pakistanis, it is unfair to imagine that Islamabad had a hand in it. Besides, there is also a joint anti-terrorism mechanism in place. Both New Delhi and Islamabad must realize that the scourge of terrorism is severely threatening the peace process. The Kashmir issue cannot be solved by Pervez Musharraf and Manmohan Singh alone. The leaders need to have the support of the opposition, the media and the people of both the countries. So it is necessary for them to shed all prejudices.

 Yours faithfully,

Pronab Kumar Haldar, Calcutta

 Sir The report, Bus rolls, despite bombs (Feb 21), symbolizes the triumph of love and empathy over fear and suspicion. The sweet taste of kheer is just as enduring for Pakistanis as it is for Indians. Those who have travelled by the next Samjhauta Express to Pakistan have truly demonstrated that the love for a fellow human being outweighs the fear of death. However, despite the camaraderie, the immediate need is to strengthen the security apparatus. Since the threat to life is now equal for citizens of both the nations, they should fight together against terrorism. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir The political agenda of both India and Pakistan sustains global terrorism. Those at the helm in the countries do not want to put an end to it. Pakistan wants terror to be alive so that the people have no time to evaluate the dictatorship. That would save Pakistans president from a lot of uncomfortable questions. Similarly, Indian politicians want this issue to evoke fear in the minds of people. The administration can then earn political mileage by promoting bilateral talks and by trying hard to combat terrorism without having to explain its failures in governance. Terrorism could have been countered successfully decades ago had both the nations been more sincere in their efforts. 

 Yours faithfully,

Avinash Gupta, Hooghly 

 Sir After the Mumbai train blasts last year, which had claimed 182 lives, India witnessed a similar tragedy in the Samjhauta Express. However, this time, Pakistan has suffered more losses than India (Off track, Feb 20). Kashmir has been a contentious issue since independence. Nevertheless, one had begun to see a ray of hope in the concerted efforts by both the countries to expedite people-to-people contact through the opening up of train and bus routes. Greater contact between the countries at the popular level might have thwarted the designs of the terrorists. Which is why, by killing people of both nationalities, the terrorists keep reminding us of their ominous power and presence. If we fail to contain armed militancy now, the peace efforts are bound to get mired in mistrust. Foolproof security arrangements have to be made for inter-country bus and train communication. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir Hundreds of innocents have died because of the inefficiency of the administration in both India and Pakistan. The Samjhauta Express blasts just show that despite the Mumbai train tragedy, the Indian government remains indifferent to the safety and security of its railway passengers. There should have been stricter vigilance, especially in the case of trains running through the two countries. Merely conducting diplomatic meetings from time to time will not help unless other ground realities are addressed. One hopes that this calamity will make both the nations hasten the peace process. The first task will be to destroy the terrorists camps situated within Pakistani territory. Such a step on the part of Pakistan will earn it Indias trust.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

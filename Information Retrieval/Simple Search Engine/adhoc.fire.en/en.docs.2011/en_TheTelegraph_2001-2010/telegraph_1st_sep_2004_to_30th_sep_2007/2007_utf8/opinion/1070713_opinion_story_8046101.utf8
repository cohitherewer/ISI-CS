 STAY BACK HOME

 BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh

 In the last few weeks, two true sons of Delhi passed away. Their innings were of much substance and their legacy will live on through the institutions they, and their families, created. That generation of business people embraced all that came their way. They were not insular, and they did not isolate themselves from the activity of the city. They built institutions, gave their support to entrepreneurial ventures, endorsed fresh, untested ideas and were an intrinsic part of life and living. Many of us have personal memories that come together with those of countless others to form a mosaic that reveals a Delhi that was civilized, gracious and cultured. I consider myself privileged to have been a part of that special Dilli.

 Today, the city has deteriorated, developed ugly scars and gaping wounds. Rather ironically, the citys intellectual and cultural energy has made it an exciting metropolis despite the overriding presence of the government and all the trappings of a careless, exploitative and exclusive administration. This ghastly VIP syndrome, where the VIPs live off the earnings and wealth of enterprising citizens either directly or indirectly, is shameful. 

 At the cremation of Lala Bharatram this unpleasant reality was overpowering. The security personnel, cleansing the space for the arrival of the prime minister (who came for precisely two minutes), took over the streets leading to the crematorium and the crematorium itself, and exposed Indias primitive ways in a technologically-advanced world. It was abrasive and disconnected with the mood of a large community of people, who were there to bid farewell to a stalwart Dilliwallah and a friend.

 Strange animals

 Old, venerable, retired civil servants, comrades and friends were put through metal detectors, their bags and bodies were searched, and they were made to stand behind barricades in that unrelenting heat and humidity. I thought some would faint or die as they waited patiently for a brief visit. It was, for me, a truly sad moment that spoke volumes about the degradation of our sense of appropriate behaviour at times such as this. It was the new ethos of the new Dilli, one which suffocated with all that was considered wrong and insensitive when we were growing up. The values of living have changed. The political class, assisted by babus, have brought another standard into play one that demeans ordinary, honest, law-abiding citizens, all those who were on the other side of the barricade!

 Prime ministers, who need protection of this kind, should refrain from appearing at such public occasions with their security paraphernalia till such time that their security becomes unobtrusive and invisible, like elsewhere in the world. To block a main artery of the city for over half-an-hour, creating dreadful traffic snarls for working men and women, is unwarranted. Then, to take over the parking lot and force bereaved friends, many over eighty-years-old, to leave their cars parked illegally along the edge of a busy flyover is just not on. Till this kind of security mechanism has been corrected, all those who need protective cover must stay in their protected homes and offices and not venture into the realm of the ordinary. Visit friends at home and traverse the streets after rush hours that should be made mandatory.

 Imagine, if these protected citizens of democratic India moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan, which is maintained at a huge cost, lived together within its walls, walked under cover to Parliament House and used a chopper to get to the airport, what joy it would be for us lesser mortals. We would belong once again to a city we once loved. Dilli would be restored and its special ethos, renewed. Dilliwallahs would be respected for their mind and intellect and their other attributes, and not for being that strange animal the VIP.

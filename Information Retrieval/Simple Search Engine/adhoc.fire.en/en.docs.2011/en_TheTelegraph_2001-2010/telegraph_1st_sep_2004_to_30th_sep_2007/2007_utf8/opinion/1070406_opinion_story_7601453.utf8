 Advice to the master

 Difficult moments

Sir Although Team Indias World Cup dreams have ended, and the fans have more or less come to terms with the disappointment, the analysts are still not done with their player-bashing (Sachin still has good cricket left: Wright, April 1). While it is important to investigate the causes of Indias humiliating performance in the tournament, it should also be borne in our minds that such debacles do happen in sports, where success or failure is largely a matter of chance. So this is hardly the time for ad-hoc statements or blame-games. Moreover, it is not as if a few players in the team are passing through a lean patch. Rather, the entire team has performed appallingly. Instead of pointing fingers at individual players, one should think constructively in order to assess the problems faced by the entire team. If the team was good enough to make it to the finals in 2003, why has the present squad failed so miserably, not even managing to make it to the Super Eight stage? And this, despite having quite a few veteran players who had played in the last World Cup? 

 It is legitimate that players would be criticized for under-performing, but then, that criticism cannot be excessive or inspired by frenzy or just a few thoughtless comments. Ian Chappells unwarranted advice to Sachin Tendulkar about his retirement is the latest instance of such brashness. Such off-hand remarks convey the idea that the team management or the players are not worried enough about their collective failure. Greg Chappell too had to send an SMS to a journalist discussing his grievances against the team. Predictably, the message made it to the newspapers, just as Chappells earlier e-mail against Sourav Ganguly had been leaked out to the media. One wonders why Chappell chooses such sensational ways to discuss the teams problems when everything could have been done far more openly, and in a more dignified manner, through press conferences. Instead of standing by the team and taking responsibility for the mishap, Chappell is busy diverting attention from himself, thereby underplaying his own drawbacks. India does not need such shirkers. There are enough indigenous experts who can guide the team on to success without having rude foreigners telling us how to change the fate of cricket in the subcontinent.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is obvious to anyone watching Indian cricket over the past two years that Sachin Tendulkar should retire. The only point of interest about the current debate is that in contrast to sycophantic pundits who pander to local fantasies, a foreigner with a no-nonsense approach has shown that the emperor has no clothes.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Sachin Tendulkar is perhaps the only mature and successful cricketer who does not react easily to provocative statements made about him by cricket gurus. It is a matter of concern that he was demoted in the batting order during the World Cup, even though there was plenty of evidence pointing to the fact that Tendulkar has been most successful as an opener. It was rather odd, to put it mildly, that the skipper, Rahul Dravid, decided to replace Tendulkar with Virender Sehwag, who opened the innings against Bangladesh. During the Multan Test against Pakistan, Dravid had declared the innings when Tendulkar was a few runs short of his double-century. Earlier, he even gave up his captaincy quietly, when he realized that the burden of leading the team had started to affect his performance. The flip side of his stardom has been Tendulkars involvement in product endorsement. But that cannot possibly negate his many outstanding performances.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Madhu Agrawal,Dariba, Delhi 

 Sir In the sequel to Indias sorry predicament in World Cup 2007, the so-called experts have been generous with their advice to the players. Ian Chappell is the latest among these know-it-alls, who feel that Sachin Tendulkar should retire from international cricket. Coming from the former Australian skipper, this remark might have been a retaliation against Sunil Gavaskars recent censure of the on-field behaviour of the Aussies. One can hardly deny the fact that Tendulkar is passed his prime. In his heyday, he dominated opponent bowlers. But today, he is found struggling against minnows such as Bangladesh. It is not desirable that Tendulkar leaves the cricket world in such an ignominious manner. He was considered a genius and an even-headed player; he would know when to stop himself and can do without the advice of others. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rantidev Sarkar, Durgapur

 Sir Indias early exit from the World Cup has understandably upset the fans. However, we must accept that India lost to a better team, Sri Lanka, in the final league game and played poorly against Bangladesh. However, it would be quite unfair to expect Sachin Tendulkar and other senior players to retire, now that India are out of the World Cup. Tendulkar batted brilliantly against Bermuda. His dismissal against Sri Lanka was to a brilliant delivery. A lot of people are unhappy with the huge sums of money Indian cricketers make. But the fact remains that compared to European footballers and international tennis players, our cricketers are underpaid. The amount of hard work that is required to make it to the national squad should entitle the players to handsome remunerations. There is no need to sack anybody from the team because of a dismal performance in one World Cup. It is time we learn to look at things in a more holistic manner and be less hasty in our conclusions.

 Yours faithfully,

Manmath Deshpande, Nagpur

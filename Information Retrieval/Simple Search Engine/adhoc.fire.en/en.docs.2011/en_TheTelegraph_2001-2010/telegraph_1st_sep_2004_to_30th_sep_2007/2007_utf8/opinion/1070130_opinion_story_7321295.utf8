 Letters to Editor

 Fitting tribute

 Sir Teachers do not die (Jan 25) is a rare homage to a teacher by another. Teaching is certainly one of the noblest professions in the world. The story of Dipak Banerjee is the story of a man who quietly made his savings even with modest earnings. In these days, when teaching has become just another mechanical profession, it feels good to read about a teacher who took pride not only in his profession, but also in his students. Institutions like Presidency College should try to carry forward the legacy of such legendary teachers as Dipak Banerjee.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Tapas Majumdar has been successful in bringing out the brilliance, depth and erudition of Dipak Banerjee. I had the privilege of being taught by Banerjee at Presidency College. This was when he had just taken over as the head of the economics department from Amiya Bagchi. DBs it is customary to refer to teachers by their initials in Calcutta colleges discourses on macroeconomics in impeccable English, and his emphasis on the grasp of concepts, developed in his pupils a love for the subject. He was a welcome departure from the intimidating, unapproachable academic. He was full of fun and anecdotes, and was interested in a host of activities outside of the class from classical music to fishing. He was, in many ways, much ahead of his time. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Tapas Majumdars obituary essay on Dipak Banerjee was timely and satisfying. Dipakda was a fine gentleman, unassuming and kind. I had the good fortune of playing bridge with him once or twice a week at a local club for a few years. While he was an excellent player, he always kept a low profile. But he could not suffer fools gladly. Over these sessions, I have learnt a lot from him, though not necessarily in economics. Anyone who had come across him would find it difficult to forget his ways. I would certainly miss him. May his soul rest in peace.

 Yours faithfully,

Ramakrishnan Srinivasan, Calcutta

 Sir As a student of economics at Presidency College between 2003 and 2006, I have had Dipak Banerjee as my teacher. However, during this time he had already retired officially he used to come to college only once a week. He was already a legend in Calcuttas academic circles and a model teacher to his students. He, along with a few others, worked to transform a small college department into a nursery of great social and economic research. 

 Dipakbabu devoted most of his time to his students and his department, which he headed for close to two decades. Even after he had retired, he continued for around ten years to take classes voluntarily in Presidency College without hoping for any remuneration. It was only at the fag end that the faculty members, after much running around, managed to secure a token guest-teacher grant for Banerjee. It is deeply unfortunate that the government of West Bengal, which boasts several educated and intellectual ministers many of them with Presidency College connections has failed completely to give this great teacher his due.

 Yours faithfully,

Kaustav Das, Calcutta

 Sordid turf wars

 Sir The sudden decision to change the venue of the India-Sri Lanka one-day international on February 8 from Pune to Calcutta proves again that Indian cricket is now totally controlled by grimy politics (Eden may get Pune one-dayer, Jan 26). One only has to follow the sequence of events. First, Jagmohan Dalmiya was removed from the Cricket Association of Bengal. Then, the states communist leadership, in collusion with the anti-Dalmiya forces in Bengal cricket, got the police commissioner, Prasun Mukherjee, elected as the CAB chief. As soon as Mukherjee was installed, an ODI was gifted to Eden Gardens, as if to thank the current CAB bosses for getting rid of Dalmiya. Such are the workings of Pawar politics. 

 Yours faithfully,

Somnath Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias decision to shift the limited-overs match between India and Sri Lanka from Pune to Calcutta may be a welcome news for many, but it has another face that is ugly. The Eden Gardens and the cricket lovers of Bengal have been deprived of international cricket for almost a year for petty political reasons. It is crystal clear that the BCCI had a score to settle with the CAB under Jagmohan Dalmiya. The game and its enthusiasts were made pawns in this sordid turf war. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Ghosh, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The unofficial ban on the film, Parzania, in Gujarat is a severe blow to the liberal democratic values of Indian society. One recalls that just a year ago, Fanaa, a film starring Aamir Khan, had to be withdrawn from theatres in Gujarat, because Khan had expressed support for the Narmada Bachao Andolan. Stalling the screening of Parzania, a film set in the background of the Gujarat pogrom of 2002, reflects the deeper rot in this right-wing state. In the state where over 50,000 families have been displaced following the riots, justice has been slow in coming, and the minorities have been ghettoized repeatedly, the slogan of vibrant Gujarat rings hollow. Forget vibrancy, can Narendra Modis dream state even be called a democratic one? 

 Yours faithfully,

Ram Puniyani, Mumbai

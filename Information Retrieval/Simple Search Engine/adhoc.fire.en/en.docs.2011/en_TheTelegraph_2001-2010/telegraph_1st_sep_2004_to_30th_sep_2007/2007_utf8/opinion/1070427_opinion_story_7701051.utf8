 ROTTEN TO THE CORE 

 MALVIKA SINGH

 BONA FIDE

 Reading about south Asian politics 

 leaves one feeling a trifle sick. The countries in this 

 region were once home to a vibrant, ancient culture, seeped 

 in philosophies of all manner, and followed a tradition 

 that prioritized societal security despite the exploitation 

 and poverty of the people. However, the manner in which 

 politics is unfolding in the region today is disappointing, 

 to say the least. We are allowing ourselves to be deemed 

 a fourth world, so to speak, with governments and regimes 

 alienating themselves from the reality.

 A perfect example of this was 

 the interim governments decision to prevent Sheikh Hasina 

 Wajed from entering Bangladesh. What an absolutely absurd 

 and wholly undemocratic demand. Fortunately, the authorities 

 have had second thoughts and permitted her to return. Little 

 wonder then that we are considered a volatile area for 

 any real partnership, making international interventions 

 appear temporary and noncommittal. 

 The kind of petty politics that 

 dominates the subcontinent makes us inconsequential in the 

 larger scheme of influences and geo politics. We seem to 

 be the last backward region in Asia (and maybe in the world). 

 More than a quarter of the population of this planet are 

 inhabitants of south Asia. If we could play the game correctly, 

 with an open mind and as a team of nations, we could have 

 been vital in global politics.

 But this great undivided family 

 spends its time regressing. Distrust and infighting are 

 encouraged by rich nations to dominate the region. These 

 powers, much like the colonial intruders before them, make 

 us poorer by buying policies that suit their motives of 

 domination. The weakness of the regional leaders in south 

 Asia is manipulated by the rich nations by offering goodies 

 on their terms and not ours. We have been known to fall 

 prey to such lollipops. 

 Strike back

 The British drew the borders that 

 divided this family of nations, causing inexplicable damage 

 to the fabric of an ancient culture and civilization. For 

 them, military might was an assertion of power, regardless 

 of societal and cultural needs. Their wealth and education 

 have not been able to instil in them the culture of tolerance 

 or a belief in consensus. They have created modern political 

 myths and puppet leaders that suited their pedestrian understanding 

 of finer, rooted cultures. They were also responsible for 

 pursuing a policy of elimination of everything that stood 

 in their way. 

 Money, not the mind, became the 

 tool with which civilizations were ruthlessly destructed. 

 Consequently, battlegrounds sprouted across the globe. Brother 

 was made to fight brother as the unipolar power and its 

 allies watched from a safe distance till the horror they 

 had created entered their safe haven.

 Again, the real world, with all 

 its disparities, was forced to bend and take the blows both 

 politically and economically. We all know this. The year, 

 2007, is an important year in the subcontinents calendar. 

 India was liberated from the British six decades ago. Our 

 country is now on the verge of working out a peace settlement 

 with Pakistan. Both the countries have managed to achieve 

 this without having to seek external help. 

 The lone superpower of the world 

 will not be able to swallow this bitter truth. It has not 

 been a part of this settlement. Worse, it has not been 

 successful in altering the course. Will it then try and 

 create mayhem in Pakistan to stall the peace process? Is 

 it threatened by the potential power of south Asia, a region 

 which would cease to be what it is if the countries in this 

 part of the world trusted and genuinely partnered each other? 

 The time has come to take on the international powers. This 

 can only be achieved by a nonviolent movement, similar to 

 the one that gave us our freedom.

 UNCOVER THE TRUTH 

 MALVIKA SINGH

 MALA 

 FIDE

 The extraordinary praise that 

 the prime minister showered recently on the former prime 

 minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, and for no apparent reason, 

 surprised many who have been watching the political scene 

 over the last few decades and who, like countless other 

 citizens, are affected deeply by negative politics. Here 

 are two instances of the divisive politics of Rao. First, 

 he was the Union home minister when Indira Gandhi was brutally 

 shot down by her security guards. That was his first failure. 

 And then, Delhi broke into angry rioting and he was unable 

 to control the escalation of violence. He could not stop 

 the mad killing of innocents Sikhs. The blame game continues 

 till today but if one were to look at Raos report card, 

 he failed miserably at his job. If the argument is that 

 Congress party workers led the assault on the Sikh community 

 in Delhi, I would like to ask why this mentor of Manmohan 

 Singh did not assert himself, or resign? Surely, that is 

 what an honourable political leader in power should have 

 done.

 The second horror that Rao presided 

 over (the whisper was that many expected him to turn a blind 

 eye) was the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Whether it 

 functioned as a place of worship or not is a separate issue. 

 The mosque was an intrinsic part of our heritage and it 

 is unacceptable that a prime minister should have allowed 

 it to be reduced to rubble. 

 Failed hero

 If the argument on the Babri Masjid 

 issue is that its demolition was inevitable because of the 

 mistake Rajiv Gandhi committed by opening the locks, surely, 

 Rao should have reversed that wrong as a secular leader 

 and held his head up high. In both instances, this mentor 

 of the incumbent prime minister should have called in the 

 army, first for a flag march to bring about shanti, 

 and if he failed to ensure that his orders to quell the 

 rioting were carried out, he should have put in his papers. 

 By doing so, Rao would have stood 

 apart. Instead, he played bad politics in a pluralist society 

 against the Muslims and the Sikhs and alienated both from 

 the Congress. An unacceptable act from a prime minister. 

 Maybe this is the reason Manmohan Singhs devotion to 

 Narasimha Rao which compelled the Sikhs in Delhi to vote 

 against Manmohan Singh when he stood for elections from 

 this city. Many of us worked voluntarily for him during 

 that campaign and I recall being bewildered by the Sikh 

 backlash.

 Heal the wounds

 The economic reforms that Rao 

 is constantly credited with he is seen as the prime mover 

 in the restructuring of the economy is another half-truth. 

 He had no option, with the fiscal situation being what it 

 was and with the World Bank breathing heavily down his throat. 

 Left to himself, heaven knows what he would have done! He 

 had his day in the sun, and he made hay till it shone. He 

 played a kind of politics that damaged some very treasured 

 aspects of this country and its intrinsic strengths. 

 The healing process that ensued 

 after those wounds were inflicted on the society continues. 

 Therefore, for a truly honest and honourable prime minister 

 like Manmohan Singh, to salute Narasimha Rao as a great 

 statesman only shows how far removed he is from realpolitik 

 as the leader of over a billion people, half of whom do 

 not have access to the simple dignities of life.

 Nave political intervention, 

 limited sight, an inability to absorb ideas, processes and 

 advice do not make stalwart leaders. To understand and appreciate 

 the many Indias is a complex and unending learning process. 

 It is bound to be tough for politicians who have not had 

 the privilege of working consistently in a constituency, 

 of being out there where the truth lies.

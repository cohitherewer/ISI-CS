 WORKING FOR A PITTANCE 

 CHINA DIARY

 Neha Sahay

 Imagine a nationwide chain of 

 upmarket coffee shops in India building their fortune on 

 slave labour or almost. Well, much to her dismay and anger, 

 that is what a starry-eyed twenty-year-old discovered in 

 China last month. 

 Tired of working nights as a waitress 

 and as a beer-seller in bars, Xiao Ying had decided to put 

 her life in order. Her erratic hours and diet had changed 

 a plump, scrubbed-clean, ponytailed teenager into an emaciated-looking 

 girl with an unhealthy pallor, damaged skin and hair grown 

 straggly with frequent dyeing and curling. Worse, she revealed 

 that even her monthly periods had stopped. 

 Flitting from dormitory to dormitory, 

 then from one rented room to another, sometimes alone, sometimes 

 sharing it with a friend; going back and forth from her 

 village to the city where she worked, Ying was now determined 

 to hold a steady day job. She wanted her old unblemished 

 skin and her health back. So she jumped at the waitresses 

 needed notice outside this well-known chain of coffee shops. 

 It seemed a godsend she had just moved into the very building 

 where the coffee shop was located; and, with her advantage 

 of being able to speak English, even if with a strong rural 

 accent, she was sure she would soon realize her dream of 

 becoming Captain in a West caf. 

 Long nights

 The first hurdle was crossed easily 

 the shop wanted girls with a minimum height of 165 centimetres. 

 Her first visit to the caf revealed that hardly any of 

 the waitresses fitted that requirement a pretty unreasonable 

 one for Chinese girls in the South specially. But the visit 

 also blew her hopes of a day job the caf closed at 1 

 a.m. and she would have to do night shifts every two weeks. 

 But tempted by the convenience of just going upstairs to 

 sleep after a night on her feet, she decided to try it anyway. 

 A week after having joined, Ying 

 left. It was not just the contemptible salary 500 yuan. 

 That is what she had been getting when she was managing 

 a tiny grocery store three years back. There, in addition, 

 she got two meals and a bed; here, dormitory accommodation, 

 normally provided for free by Chinese employers, cost an 

 additional 200 yuan. Fortunately, she did not need it. Also 

 for a change, here she could eat all she wanted but within 

 15 minutes. 

 The salary, she was told by the 

 others in the caf, would go up within three months if she 

 worked well. But to do so, she would have to spend most 

 of it. Since Ying was from another province, her employers 

 decided she would have to have a local work permit. That 

 would cost her 150 yuan. They also wanted her to do a complete 

 health check up costing 80 yuan. 

 Bonded labour

 While they gave her a uniform, 

 she was expected to buy her own stockings and shoes. They 

 cost 15 yuan a recurring expenditure because the shoes 

 were so flimsy, they would barely last a month. Finally 

 and this she hated the most they insisted on make-up: 

 lipstick, rouge, eyeshadow, all of which she had never worn. 

 Failure to do so would result in forfeiting half a days 

 leave. And all she would get by way of leave for the first 

 three months was precisely one day a month. 

 Without earning anything, I have 

 already spent 45 yuan on this stupid job. And at the end 

 of the month, I will get not even 300 yuan! wailed Ying. 

 As it happened, Ying got nothing. The cafs rule said that 

 anyone who left within two weeks would get no salary. Thats 

 the way it is, wherever you may work, the employer told 

 her when she protested. Ive worked at many places; yours 

 has to be the worst, yelled Ying. 

 But even as she was shouting at 

 him, Ying knew, in her communist party-ruled country, there 

 was nobody who would get her her rightful dues.

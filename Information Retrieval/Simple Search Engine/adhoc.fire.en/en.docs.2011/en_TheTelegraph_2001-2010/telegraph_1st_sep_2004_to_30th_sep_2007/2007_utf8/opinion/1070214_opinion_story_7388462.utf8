The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 INTO THE SUNSET

 The coach of the Indian cricket team, Greg Chappell, has good reasons to be unhappy with the squad that has been given to him for the World Cup next month. The most important of the reasons is the clear preference for experience articulated by the selection committee. The selection quietly announces the burial of the phase of experimentation championed by Chappell. Nine out of the 15 selected players have played in a World Cup before. This is indicative of their age and their experience. It will not be unfair to infer that the selection committee has fallen back on the past to make a bid to win the World Cup. This dependence on experience has led to the inclusion of players who are not in good form currently. The two names that spring immediately to mind are those of Virender Sehwag and Irfan Pathan. The preference for the past is evident in the choice of the old warhorse, Anil Kumble, who has been around in international cricket from a time when some of the younger players were appearing for their school teams. At the heart of Chappells plans for the Indian cricket team was the effort to build a team for the future. He was looking at the sunrise, the selection committee has decided to look at the sunset.

 There is an issue that goes well beyond the debate between experience and experiment. This refers to the overall role of the coach. In present day competitive cricket, the coach is no longer the man who arranges for and conducts net practice. He is the man in command. The coach decides strategy and tactics, he plans ahead, he is responsible for the fitness of the players and he acts as teacher and guide for the players and their various technical lacunae and requirements. His success is, of course, determined by the performance of the players, which, in turn, is partially a function of the trust he enjoys of the players, and more importantly, that of the captain. Under these circumstances, it is valid to argue that the coach of the team should be a one-man selection committee. He can, if he so wants, take the assistance and opinion of others, but he should be allowed to select the team that will play under him. Cricket, alas, has not accepted this radical argument. Cricket has accepted the enhanced role of the coach but the latter is allowed to play this role only with a team that is given to him. Greg Chappell is thus expected to perform at his best with a team that is perhaps not his first choice.

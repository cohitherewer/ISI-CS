 Death be proud

 Sir The data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau reveals West Bengal as the state with the highest number of suicides in the country (Suicides give state crown of shame, June 7). This is surely a blot on the thirty-year rule by the Left Front in West Bengal. Though one might argue that suicides depend on individual and psychological factors, it is impossible to deny that socio-economic causes play a considerable part in propelling this desperate act. Besides, the higher incidence of suicides in the rural areas of West Bengal indicates that penury and deprivation have a direct bearing on many of the deaths. The bureau report does say that 20.9 per cent of the victims from rural Bengal were either involved in farming or used to work as daily labourers.

 To those eager to point to the land acquisition drive as the obvious factor behind some of the suicides, the government might retort that the collected data deal with deaths in 2005, when the acquisition had not started. But the ruling Left cannot absolve itself of responsibility by stating this. This is because the culture of trade unionism fostered by the Left Front government has precipitated the closure of a number of flourishing industries. Many displaced workers have chosen death when suddenly deprived of their means of livelihood. And now that the government has started grabbing the land of farmers without providing them with adequate recompense, the suicide rate might just go up in the state. The peoples representatives sympathize with the starving multitudes once in five years for the sake of getting votes. The latter are conveniently forgotten as soon as the leftists are re-elected to power. 

 As far as the suicides by women are concerned, the government could have prevented most of these as well. The report says that among the 6,401 women who committed suicide in rural Bengal, 4,155 were tortured by their husbands and in-laws. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has a strong network in the rural areas, with their nagarik samity and para committees. Had these bodies taken up the right causes, they could have prevented a lot of suicides by women. But nearly all of these organizations have become dens of corruption and even a murderer or a arapist can get away by bribing the comrades who preside over the shalishi courts. The number of suicides will easily go down once the government and its organs cease to be corrupt. Unless the government ensures the well-being of the poor, building shopping malls for the rich cannot come to any good. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The rate of suicide in rural Bengal is shocking. While the country celebrates the rise in GDP growth, thousands of farmers are choosing death over destitution. This is a matter of shame, not just for the government but for all of us. Instead of blaming one another, we should all try to alleviate the misery of our farmers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Lubna Salim, Calcutta

 Sir One has to be terribly prejudiced to blame the state government for the rising cases of suicide in Bengals villages. True, the political impinges on the personal, but it would be presumptuous to say that every suicide has direct links with issues of the state. The decision to end ones life is purely personal, which can have little to do with governmental policies. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Kumar, Calcutta 

 Tortoise post

 Sir Sending letters by Speed Post might have become cheaper, but I wonder whether anybody would risk taking the help of this service, given the speed with which postal authorities discharge their duties (Just come by courier: cheaper Speed Post, June 12). I had gone to the General Post Office, Calcutta, two months back to post a parcel to be delivered to my brother-in-law in Kuwait. The parcel has not been delivered till date. Repeated complaints to the GPO have fallen on deaf ears. Moreover, the postal authorities have failed to provide any information regarding the current status of the parcel. If immediate action is not taken against the lackadaisical personnel, no one will ever get their parcels on time. 

 Yours faithfully,

Fouzia Shaikh, Calcutta

 Sir The Speed Post should be renamed the Tortoise Post. A letter relating to a job opportunity was issued in my favour by the Institute of Development Studies, Calcutta. Usually a letter dispatched from Calcutta takes about seven days to reach my place in southern Tripura. However, this particular letter was delivered to me after 16 days, when it was of no use to me anymore. I have missed the oppurtunity of a rewarding career because of the postal delay. 

 Yours faithfully,

Niranjan Sahoo, Belonia, Tripura

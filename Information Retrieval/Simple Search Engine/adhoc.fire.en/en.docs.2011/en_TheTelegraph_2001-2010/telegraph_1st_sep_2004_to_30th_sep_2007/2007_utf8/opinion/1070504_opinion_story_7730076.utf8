The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STILL BURNING

 Professional culture in India is marked by its singular lack of shame. Most politicians, bureaucrats, officials and others in positions of responsibility are tireless in honing their skills at passing the buck on the one hand, and skipping out of the way of accountability on the other. It could have been hoped that the repeated appearance of the courts in the role of high school prefect in every sphere of public life might have shamed them into action. But once again, the Supreme Court has had to ask the Centre to declare within two months what action is being taken to fight fire and subsidence in the coalfields of Jharia and Raniganj. This is a painful comment on the neglect of safety measures in a high-risk job when the first committee on mine safety was convened in 1922. The number of persons killed in mine accidents since then suggests that there has been no significant change in conditions, in spite of an increasing array of laws, recommendations, advanced technologies and action plans. In four mining disasters in the Fifties, the death toll was 278. There have been numberless other accidents. In 1975, 375 miners drowned in the Chasnala mine. The Gugnani committees report of 1979 was meant to be a masterplan for controlling fire and subsidence. The accidents since then, even as recently as 2004, 2005 and 2006, attest to the governments and mining companies callousness towards the safety of workers and of the environment.

 The Supreme Courts instruction is part of its response to a public interest litigation in 1997 that the government was ignoring the rights of the people in Raniganj, Jharia, Asansol and Dhanbad. The government is supposed to be tackling the old fires in the mines, but a visiting panel has reported that very little has been done in accordance with the approved action plan. The safety measures are inadequate and provisions for the economic rehabilitation of affected families non-existent. It is still not quite clear who is responsible for what, as the companies express sadness after every disaster, and the Centre, irrespective of which party or group is in power, spouts grave promises and immediately plunges into blissful amnesia. This long history of negligence is an indication of the miserable poverty and powerlessness of mine workers. But this kind of myopia is ultimately foolish. The deaths of poor people may not count, but an economic and environmental disaster is now becoming inevitable.

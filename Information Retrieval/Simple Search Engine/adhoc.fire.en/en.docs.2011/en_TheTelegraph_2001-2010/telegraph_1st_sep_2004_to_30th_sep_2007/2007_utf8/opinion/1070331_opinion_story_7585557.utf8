 A MADNESS CALLED CRICKET

 THIS ABOVE ALL- KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Code of dots and dashes

 I confess I got a certain amount of malicious pleasure watching our cricket team being humiliated by the Bangladeshis. It would have been different if the Pakistanis had given our boys a drubbing. We fight on equal terms. Though the Pakis have got the better of us more often than we have of them, we have often hammered them on their own soil. Our rivalry is as ancient as our existence as separate nations. But Bangladesh beating us was something beyond our imagination. It is only yesterday they learnt to play the game and today they dare to beat us! As they say, pride goeth before a fall. And we were full of vainglory till the Bongs rubbed our noses in the Jamaican dirt.

 We tend to go overboard in our enthusiasm for cricket. The adoration we gave to Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag, Irfan Pathan, Mohammed Kaif, Anil Kumble and their playmates defies belief. Prayers were offered in temples, mosques and gurudwaras for their victory. It ceased to be a game and became a kind of dharamyudha. All said and done, cricket is little more than sophisticated gulli-danda. Nobody gives a fake naya paisa to a gulli-danda champion, but the day a boy makes it to the Indian cricket side, he becomes a minor deity, and a crorepati. He makes lakhs more selling fizzy drinks, soaps, toothpastes, cell-phones, cycles, motor cars etc., and cricket becomes a pastime. It is as sickening as it is laughable. If we showed more restraint in our hero-worship and our media, both print and electronic, not waste their paper and time, we might get a more balanced attitude to the game. Defeat at the hands of Bangladesh would not make us suicidal, nor making a record score against Bermuda elevate our spirits to nirvanic heights. Remember, it is only a game, not a matter of life or death.

 Be not obsessed with death

 Renuka is the daughter of Bhapa Pritam Singh, the most prominent Punjabi publisher of his time who died over a year ago. She was brought up as a Sikh, but has become an ardent disciple of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. She rang me up to ask whether she could drop in for a minute to deliver an urgent message. I invited her over to join my evening mehfil. By the time she arrived, the bazm (assemblage) was chiraaghaan (fully lit) by josh-e-kada (wine). She refused to partake of the libation I offered her: she is a strict teetotaller. I asked her what message she had come to deliver. She took a bright red string and proceeded to tie it like a rakhi on my left wrist. This is from the Dalai Lama, she said, it is to bless you for a peaceful death.

 To say I was taken aback would be a gross understatement. Most people wish me long life and good health; this one sounded like wishing me a speedy departure. Thats an odd kind of blessing, I stuttered: What better can you or anyone of your age wish for? she asked. And left.

 Later at night, I pondered over the blessing. I was reminded of Keatss immortal opening lines of Ode to the Nightingale. He was sitting under a tree on a full-moon night when the bird began its mournful melody:

 My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains / My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,/ Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains/ One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk: 

 In the second verse, Keats asks for more wine so that I might drink, and leave the world unseen/ And with thee fade away into the forest dim:

 Why envy the Nightingale? Keats answers in his third verse:

 Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget/ What thou among the leaves hast never known,/ The weariness, the fever, and the fret/ Here, where men sit and hear each other groan.

 The more I pondered over the holy message, the more I realized how profound it was. When a person is in his seventies or eighties, it is foolish to nurture worldly ambitions of any kind. His elders, including his parents, who gave assurance of continuity, are gone. So are many contemporaries and many younger than oneself. That itself should be a reminder that your turn to go is drawing nearer and nearer. A more telling reminder is the gradual decaying of ones bodily functions: teeth gone, vision and hearing impaired, movements getting slower by the day, memory fading and so on, it could be worse with the onset of diseases that cause pain to the body. Thats what Keats meant by men hearing each other groan. Bodily aches and pains are real and make living insufferable. Much as you might hate to think of your own death, you cant put it completely out of your mind. Dont brood over it, dont let it become a morbid obsession, continue to enjoy food, drink, jovial company and cheerfulness and pray or if you dont believe in prayer, wish you fade out peacefully into eternal sleep.

 Ode to the bindi

 All said and done, at fifty,

 dear bindi, you brighten up 

 the day

 Each morning, Ive something

 to look forward to in the mirror,

 and a game to play

 Which one of you 

 shall I use today?

 A full-stop of red

 to keep the ardent lover at bay?

 An asterisk of gold 

 for the one I wish to amuse?

 The black exclamation mark

 for those curious to learn 

 how I juggle

 fidelity with occasional flings?

 Mark of the Hindu, fashion-

 statement

 ever since Madonna took to you;

 symbol of wedlock or mere

 facial embellishment, dumb bindi,

 eloquent in your shapes

 My Morse code of dots and dashes

 bindi, that flashes

 the one I wish to invite.

 N.B. Occasioned by Aishwarya Rais visits, with the Bachchan family, to various temples in UP, and the dot of vermillion on her forehead.

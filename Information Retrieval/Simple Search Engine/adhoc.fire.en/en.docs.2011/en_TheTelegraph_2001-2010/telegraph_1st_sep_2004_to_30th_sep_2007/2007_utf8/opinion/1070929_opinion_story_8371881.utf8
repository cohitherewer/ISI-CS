 IN A NOWHERE LAND

 Visual Arts

 The recently concluded exhibition, Young Contemporaries 2007, curated by Jogen Chowdhury at the Aakriti Art Gallery, brought together works by 20 artists. Most of them were born in the Seventies and the Eighties, and are, or have been, students of Visva-Bharati University. Having received institutional training in Bengal, all of them, it could be claimed, have come out of the Bengal school. But such a description would belie their complex and strikingly original creations. 

 Many of the works are intensely self-aware as well as keenly conscious of major movements in modern art and the masterpieces that have come out of these aesthetic revolutions. Even more spectacularly, many of the images are cleverly self-referential and experiment with indigenous traditions. Some of these qualities would have tempted viewers to spot the influences on these works. But a visit to this show did not turn out to be the usual intellectual guessing game. On the contrary, the overall effect was emotionally enriching.

 Amiya Nimai Dharas sprawling installation, Tsunami, using painted fibreglass and terracotta, occupied a corner of the room. The idea of scattering miniature boats over an imagined ocean of nothingness was arresting. The fact that the boats also looked like lost pairs of shoes added to the novelty (one recalls Robinson Crusoes discovery of a pair of shoes, also after a marine deluge, that were not fellows). However, the supine body in the middle of this assembly of boats/shoes appeared superfluous, inimical to the poetic moment so carefully crafted. Nantu Behari Das uses plastic bottles, packets and resin ingeniously to create human and animal figures. The most amusing among these is the life-size cow made with empty plastic packets of Amul milk.

 Sabir Alis oils capture the enigma of the ethnic world, the conflicts and coincidences between spirituality, cultural history and identities. The presence of Bollywood is also palpable. Aankhen bandh karo, which depicts a man from behind, holding a bunch of flowers, is moving. Sweta Chandra uses decorative plywood with startling effect, opening out unseen spaces on the board to suggest vistas, depths and ghostly furniture. Sajal Kaity, Sanjay Patra and Tapati Chowdhury choose elliptical, but rather bland, subjects.

 Without being too mannered, Sudeshna Mitra Battig succeeded with her series on windows. Salvador Dal had used an open window as a frame in his early portrait of a girl gazing out at the sea. Although the casements in Mitra Battigs canvases are neither magical nor open out on perilous seas, yet they are animated structures, with their curtains fluttering in a slow breeze. Sumitava Maity is also engaging, courtesy his little human figures gradually fading away against the horizon. There are disturbing black canopies over these tiny people that look like the hand of Evil poised to embrace them.

 Reji Arackal and Sekhar Baran Karmakar twist and turn human beings into grotesque creatures of fantasy. The former blows them up, distorting body parts beyond recognition, and ends up with comic monsters. Drawn with that clear line which Jogen Chowdhury made his signature style, Arackals figures sometimes resemble the contorted faces blowing the winds in a medieval mappa mundi or in early cartographic documents.

 Soumya Samantas urban couples embody a mysterious and ineffable truth. They sit silently, semi-transformed into bizarre creatures, on a luminous red bedspread. Unspoken words lie in heaps around them as they fix the viewer with their one-eyed stare. The mystery of their lives is externalized through a fantastic world of geometric shapes and pure colours.

 Another version of emotional economy comes across in Sharmi Chowdhurys brilliant tempera on silk, Dissident Dreams (picture). Chowdhury, whose formative years were spent in Santiniketan, went on to do an MFA from the M.S. University in Baroda. The presiding genius of her work is Bhupen Khakhar, the great master of the Baroda school, whose colourful canvases teeming with people stand behind Chowdhurys vision. 

 However, the vibrant eroticism of Khakhars world is sublimated into gleeful comedy by Chowdhury. She dresses up frolicking pigs and smiling, elusive elephants in printed underwears. Men and beasts engage in strange acts of intimacy. People point to the distance, craning their necks to decipher something outside the frame of the canvas, their lips puckered into amazement. It seems as if they have discovered the source of such topsy-turvy man-animal magic and are willing the viewer to enjoy the fun with them. But their mischievous creator would rather have her viewers wondering instead of revealing the secret.

 In the name of the mother

Standing Alone In Mecca: A Pilgrimage Into The Heart Of Islam (HarperCollins, Rs 395) by Asra Q. Nomani is a self-discovery effected through a personal search, and retrieval, of the liberal roots of a tradition, commonly perceived to have taken a decisive turn towards conservatism and fundamentalism in our own times. Nomani is a former Wall Street Journal correspondent and an Indian-American Muslim feminist who, in 2003, had insisted on praying in the hall meant for men alone, in her local West Virginia mosque. Against the backdrop of the Iraq War, she travelled to Mecca, as a single mother with her son, to advertise that she was guilty of zina or illicit sex. This book narrates how the haj taught her to relate the lives of contemporary Muslim women to those of the past. It shows how the gender liberalism of yore has been steadily usurped by the conservative Islam of today. Nomani exposes the two-fold marginalization of both women and liberals by the Wahhabism that produced, in the long-run, an Osama bin Laden. This engaging book is also her attempt at salvaging what she believes is the real Islam, and implement its lessons in countering the gender discrimination at her local mosque and in the Muslim world as a whole.

 Naked in the Wind (Penguin, Rs 250) by Brinda Charry captures an India mutating into a new identity, defined by communal tension and violence. The predicament of a family leads the residents of Campbell Street to confront the disturbing reality. Vasu returns to his family after an unexplained absence of fifteen years with another man, supposedly his caretaker. The community suspects that the two men are evading the law and that they will eventually return to their recent past a past mixed up with religious insanity and violence. Charry has an eye for detail and is more successful in exploiting the over-used technique of multiple first-person narratives than she is with her prose, which often fails to get both sentence-structure and the sound of words right at the same time. A typical blot is a phrase like the afternoon rain is the side effect [reviewers emphasis] of cyclones.

 365 Ways to Change the World (MapinLit, Rs 395) by Michael Norton 

 comes with a foreword by Mark Tully and suggests an action every day of the year that can make a difference to ones immediate neighbourhood and the world at large. Aimed at converting the cynic and encouraging the do-gooder, this book is a manual of easy charity. Any individual fact or story can motivate the reader and trigger a chain reaction through his social intercourse. For example, Agnes Lennox sets up a wig bank to help others after she lost her hair due to chemotherapy and found the prescribed wigs expensive. Nortons illustrations show the beauty of thinking small.

Picture of India (Ajanta, Rs 195) by Chris Boyes is subtitled Journey through the Eyes of a British Tourist, and is an account of contemporary India meant for lay tourists. Boyes uses the word picture to denote a film that might construct an India for the viewer. He also uses the term to connote a landscape that would thematically connect cinema with train travel. His India, thus, emerges from films and extensive rail travel. Boyess unpretentious and lucid prose hints at authorial and observational honesty. However, this enthusiast of Indian culture ought to be reminded that Hindi cinema is not synonymous with Indian cinema, nor does it educate one about the larger half of the country.

 Letters to Editor

 Like Father, not like son

 Sir Alright, so Sanjay Dutt has acted in a film with a Gandhi connection. But does that mean that all reports on his prison sentence must bring the father of the nation into the picture? If Dutt uses foreign-made toiletries in prison or smokes Marlboro Lights, then we must note how un-Gandhian that is (ignoring completely the fact that an ordinary prisoner would not be allowed these liberties). If he scribbles, we are told that Gandhi too wrote behind bars. Arent readers mature enough to know the difference between film and reality?

 Yours faithfully,

 Pushpa De Sarkar, Calcutta

 Wear and tear

 Sir Today, there is a very thin line differentiating what is indecent from what is not (Brief on briefs, July 30). Exposure of the flesh, promiscuity and lust by either of the sexes no longer raise storms in the teacup. Attitudes are changing fast. Hence it was a bit immature on the part of the government to ban an advertisement for a male undergarment brand that showed women fantasizing over mens sizes. Why is it so difficult to believe that women too can freely express their sexual desires? The modern man too is more confident about his body. When both men and women no longer have qualms about speaking about their sexual desires, what is the point of banning advertisements which merely portray this truth? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudeep Roy, Bangalore

 Sir It has been correctly pointed out in Brief on briefs that, with greater openness in society, we have to accept how perfectly normal it is for women to get aroused by men in briefs. If men ogling at skimply-dressed men is acceptable, there is no reason why we should squirm at women gazing at men flaunting their sexuality. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Too much fuss is being made these days about what men and women are wearing. Take the fracas over teachers wearing salwar-kameez in a girls school in Bankrahat (Tight wrapping, July 29). The law states that teachers should wear decent dresses to school. Neither the school authorities nor guardians of the students have any business interfering with how teachers should dress, as long as what they wear is decent. It is true that not all teachers are today inspired by the Gandhian principle of simple attire. It is possible to make both sari and salwar-kameez look indecent on the wearer. 

 But the point is that if a dress code is to be imposed, then it should apply to both men and women. Just as there are uniforms for students, there can be one for teachers as well. Many hospitals have made it mandatory for their attending doctors to wear ties. A uniform would straightaway solve the problem of deciding which dress is decent and which is not. All schools should be encouraged to introduce uniforms for their teachers to instil a sense of discipline and equality among them.

 Yours faithfully,

Unmesh Ganguly, Calcutta

 Sir Why ban some television commercials for mens innerwear after these have been aired for months? People have got used to watching these advertisements, and do not seem to mind them either. To ban them now would be to give them some publicity for free. 

 The Union government should set up a censor board for screening ad-films. It could also instruct the film censor board to do the job. And why only advertisements for underwear brands, there are many others which need to be banned. Take for instance the liquor brands, which resort to surrogate advertising and indirectly publicize their alcoholic products. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

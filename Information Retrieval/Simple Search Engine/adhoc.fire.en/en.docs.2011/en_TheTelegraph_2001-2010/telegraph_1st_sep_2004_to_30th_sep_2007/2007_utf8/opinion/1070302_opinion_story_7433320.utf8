 Something for all

 Sir The railway budget announced by the Union railways minister, Lalu Prasad, should make most Indians happy (Cattle class to comfort zone, Feb 27). He has not only reduced the fares for the first class while keeping that of the second class unchanged, but also launched a few new trains. Under his ministership, the Indian Railways has been doing good business, and Lalu Prasad has been able to introduce the changes largely on the strength of the Rs 20,000 crore cash-surplus before dividend reaped by the railways.

 However, a budget cannot be termed well-planned merely if it slashes existing rates. Indian Railways has not been able to ensure the security of its passengers, a fact proved yet again by the recent blasts in the Samjhauta Express. Besides, trains continue to run late, inconveniencing commuters. These problems faced by the regular users of the service continue to be neglected by the ministry in spite of repeated promises to guarantee the punctuality of trains and security of the passengers.

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir Lalu Prasad clearly knows how to please people across classes. First-class travellers would be happy with the 3 per cent reduction in fares which could go up to 6 per cent in the lean season. And the passengers of the cattle class, who make up the largest chunk of the ministers vote bank, have been appeased, too, with the comfort of cushioned seats instead of the existing wooden benches. 

 Yours faithfully,

Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai 

 Sir The railway budget can be called a success only if Lalu Prasad makes sure that his words are followed up by appropriate action. If the railway officers remain their usual inactive self while carrying out their duties, then the budget is very likely to fall flat on its face. 

 There must be strict regulations to prohibit passengers in particular the VIPs from travelling without ticket. And it is not enough to declare 2007 as the cleanliness year. The railways should be transformed into a sanitary mode of travelling. The waiting-rooms in most stations also need to be maintained well. Their numbers too should be increased to benefit transit passengers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir It is thoughtful of Lalu Prasad to introduce special couches for the physically challenged in Indian trains. It would be better still if one or two wheelchairs are kept ready for use in all reserved compartments.

 Yours faithfully,

Amitava Banerjee, Chennai

 Sir If Indian Railways is to compete with the airlines, then the first fares that need to be reduced are that of the Rajdhani trains. This can be done by abolishing the charge for food, which is included in the ticket fare now. This will also stop the wastage of money on passengers who prefer to bring their own provisions.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Lalu Prasads performance as the railways minister is quite in contrast with his track record as the chief minister of Bihar. In his budget, he has not been biased in favour of his own state, as our railways ministers are traditionally wont to do. Ten years from now, Lalu Prasads contribution to the growth of the railways will have to be acknowledged. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir The railway budget for 2007-08 deserves whole-hearted praise, not criticism (Rich but poor, Feb 26). It is difficult to imagine how Lalu Prasad can be considered selfish after presenting a budget that enhances the existing facilities and serves the interests of both the rich and the poor. It may be true that his predecessor, Nitish Kumar, tried to bring commercial sense to the railways, but even Kumar had to adopt certain selfish means in preparing and executing his budget. 

 Yours faithfully,

D.N. Singh, Bokaro

 Sir It is heartening to know that closed-circuit televisions and video cameras would be installed at sensitive stations for the safety of rail travellers. But would these gadgets serve their purpose? After all, they are going to be run by the personnel of the railway protection force, most of whom are hopelessly corrupt. It is common knowledge that anti-social elements collude with the RPF to pilfer the goods which are loaded and unloaded in the railway yards. Small wonder then that railway journeys are getting more unsafe every day, given that the security of the passengers are in the hands of thoroughly dishonest men. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rajkumar Jain, Kharagpur

 Sir Notwithstanding Lalu Prasads tall claims, the truth remains that most of our railway coaches are dirty and cockroach-infested, the toilets are filthy, and the food served unpalatable. Unauthorized vendors have a free run on the trains and platforms, and accidents are forever on the rise. The railways minister is welcome to travel incognito and see these for himself. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

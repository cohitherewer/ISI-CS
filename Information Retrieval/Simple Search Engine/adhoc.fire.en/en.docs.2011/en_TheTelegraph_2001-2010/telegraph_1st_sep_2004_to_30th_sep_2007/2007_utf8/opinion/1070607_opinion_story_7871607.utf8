 A VISIT TO LITTLE INDIA 

 D.B.N. MURTHY

 Fifth Column

 Little India? the young manager 

 at the Phnom Penh Sapphire hotel desk was foxed looking 

 at the city map. We tried another line. Can you please 

 suggest an Indian vegetarian restaurant? His face lit up. 

 Sure, I can take you there by my taxi. Only US $10, he 

 gushed. Being three-day-old in Cambodia, I knew that the 

 price quoted would be in American dollars, the favoured 

 currency of that country. By then, I had become wise too. 

 A bit of bargaining brought the price down to a reasonable 

 seven dollars.

 Soon, we were speeding in an air-conditioned 

 Toyota to Shiv Sakthi near the Independence Square. A polite 

 and smiling Cambodian boy ushered in and made us comfortable. 

 I came to know later that it is mandatory to employ local 

 boys and girls if you wish to run your own restaurant. The 

 ambience was typically Indian gaddi, incense sticks, 

 brass lamps and soft sitar music. Soon, a person 

 came bustling in with a pad in his hand. It didnt take 

 much time to figure out that he was an Indian. From Dehra 

 Dun, he smiled after hearing the query in my smattering 

 Hindi.

 The menu card brought us smiles. 

 We could order veg thalis for the price of four dollars 

 each. My wife wanted curd and raita. For starters, 

 we had the local Angkor beer, which tasted good. There were 

 gulab jamuns and hot jalebis as well; authentic 

 stuff, we admitted. The meal was rounded off with a glass 

 of Australian wine, which tasted heavenly.

 A Cambodian boy approached us 

 and enquired which type of beeda we would like to 

 have. We settled for a sada variety. Sir, shall 

 light your beedi? he asked me solicitously. I burst 

 out laughing, No, thanks, I dont smoke. That was one 

 of the best evenings we spent in our month-long sojourn 

 in southeast Asia.

 Change is in the air

 During the trip, we discovered 

 that Cambodia has progressed in several fields over the 

 years. For example, I found there were many more lodges 

 and guesthouses that have mushroomed, thanks to the interest 

 in Cambodias ruined temples and its cultural heritage. 

 Traffic has increased at least two-fold and the motorbike 

 is the symbol of power as both men and women use it to commute. 

 I also discovered that it was cheaper and faster to hitch 

 a ride on the pillion of a freelance motorbike rider who 

 could be spotted at road corners looking for his prey. 

 A word of warning be prepared for a rough ride. The riders 

 drive their bikes at breakneck speed to make money quickly.

 Phnom Penh lies at the confluence 

 of three rivers Mekong, Bassac and Tonle Sap. No Sir, 

 I havent seen the river bursting the banks ever since I 

 was born, assured our young hotel manager. Maybe I will 

 ask my father, he said. I sat on the banks gazing at the 

 gentle river, and the boats and barges plying on the placid 

 waters. 

 The hotel manager volunteered 

 to drive us round the city for the whole day with an outing 

 to the Killing Fields of Pol Pot, all for twenty five 

 dollars. He told us that his grandfather was one of the 

 victims of the brutal killing of thousands of innocent people 

 by the Khmer Rouge. A commemorative stupa at the 

 Killing Fields of Choeung Ek contains skulls of about 8000 

 victims, exhumed from mass graves, arranged as per age and 

 sex. It brought back those painful memories of my trip to 

 Auschwitz five years ago. Driven by poverty, some villagers 

 dig these mass graves in search of jewellery.

 No visit to Phnom Penh is complete 

 without a visit to the National Museum and the Royal Palace 

 complex that contains the Silver Pagoda and the Jade Buddha. 

 In front of the museum is the idol of Ganesh and inside 

 it lies the statues of Hindu gods and goddesses. King Jayavarman 

 VII, one of the greatest Khmer rulers, had once declared 

 that the pain of the people...makes the pain of the king. 

 How we wish that some of our leaders followed in the steps 

 of this wise king.

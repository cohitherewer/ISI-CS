 BATTLE FOR THE HIGH SEAS

 - Joint naval exercises in the Bay of Bengal are a step 

 in the right direction

 WATER POWER

 Although a maritime nation on 

 the map, India had lacked a naval tradition for ages. Indian 

 states confined themselves to mostly land skirmishes throughout 

 history till the Europeans arrived by sea. It was the British 

 who built a united army, as well as a modern navy, for the 

 country. However, credit must be given to Indira Gandhi 

 for a navy that is respected for its operational preparedness 

 and professionalism today. Against this backdrop, the Indian 

 governments decision to hold joint naval exercises with 

 friendly navies deserves praise. 

 The naval forces of the United 

 States of America, Japan, Australia, Singapore and India 

 are all set for joint exercises off the eastern coast of 

 India. Australia, Japan, Singapore and the US are wary of 

 the Chinese navy and of the threat posed by maritime piracy 

 and terrorism to sea routes. Interestingly, all four nations 

 have recently undertaken massive naval modernization projects. 

 The transformation of the Australian 

 Navy into an expeditionary force sped up in 2006 with the 

 commissioning of the three Air Warfare Destroyers programme. 

 Besides, all its six Collins class submarines are new and 

 have a long range of 9,000 nautical miles. Its eight Meko 

 class frigates were built between 1996 and 2006 and have 

 a range of 6,000 nautical miles at 18 knot. 

 A traditional naval power with 

 the rare glory of sinking both Russian and American ships, 

 Japans maritime legacy still haunts the world. In 2005, 

 Japan signalled a shift from a purely defensive military 

 stance to one capable of handling the threats of ballistic 

 missiles, terrorism and guerrilla warfare. And understandably, 

 Japan looks with concern at the rise of the Chinese navy. 

 Hence, Japan is likely to base its navy on aircraft carriers. 

 With five submarines and four destroyers in the production 

 pipeline, the Japanese fleet consists of a variety of powerful 

 submarines, destroyers and frigates.

 One of the tiniest naval states, 

 Singapore, nevertheless, has a coastline of 104 nautical 

 miles. The Singapore Strait is the most important shipping 

 channel linking the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea 

 through which pass Australian and Japanese ships. Not surprisingly, 

 the one-city, one-airport and one-port state has a navy 

 of six modern submarines of Swedish origin and six German-designed 

 corvettes and has now gone for six French-made frigates 

 with a range of 4,000 nautical miles.

 Little, of course, needs to be 

 said about the US navy. The Indian navy will soon be using 

 the US-built Austin class amphibious transport dock ship 

 Trenton. In fact, India may also go for a second ship named 

 Nashville of the same class.

 Thus, the Indian move to go for 

 joint exercises in the Bay of Bengal with modern and powerful 

 navies does not appear to be either unwise or myopic. The 

 threat to sea lanes and lines of communication, commerce 

 and crude oil is more real than ever before. What the Royal 

 Navy alone could have done in the 20th century can no longer 

 be resorted to by even the American navy. Todays navies 

 need to pool their expertise and resources to deal with 

 the common threat from terrorists and fundamentalists. The 

 Indian navy is on the right track, politically motivated 

 protests notwithstanding. A land-fixated elephant can never 

 understand the depth and the dangers of the sheet of water 

 that constitutes two-thirds of the earths surface.

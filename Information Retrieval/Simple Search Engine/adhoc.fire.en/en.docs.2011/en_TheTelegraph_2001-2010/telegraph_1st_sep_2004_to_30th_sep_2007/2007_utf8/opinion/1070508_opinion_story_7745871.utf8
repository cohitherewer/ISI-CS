 BEYOND LAW

 The meaningfulness of law resides in the appropriateness of its application. But this set of rules founded on ideals of reason and fairness that is intended to protect the innocent and the powerless, can be turned on its head in a jiffy if the wielder of law so wishes. Applied in areas that do not fall strictly within its purview, or applied in anger, the process of law appears trivial, while delaying the delivery of justice in urgent cases by distracting attention from the main work of the courts. The justice system is hardly dignified, for example, by its unremitting pursuit of Maqbool Fida Husain, an artist who has brought honour to India, and who now, at over ninety, is unable to return to his country because he drew Hindu goddesses without clothes. His failure to respond to court summons has culminated in an order from a Hardwar court to attach his property in Mumbai. 

 It is not just a question of confusing aesthetics with morality or religion. What is disconcerting is the repeated reflection of Indian societys most retrogressive and divisive sentiments in some of the decisions of the courts. Artistic freedom is not the only ideal that is in danger, but all kinds of behaviour perceived as non-conformist can and do become legally vulnerable. At these moments, it would seem that there is no distinction between disapproval from certain sections of society and the law. There are warrants against Richard Gere and Shilpa Shetty for a public kiss, because a magistrate in Jaipur decided that the kiss was sexually erotic. Nothing can better represent the institutional articulation of the countrys nervously eager muddle-headedness regarding sex and the evil Western influence. A plural society which is out of its depth in its own plurality is a sorry sight, but the law going beyond its purview by presupposing rules of conduct argues a graver lack of balance. That lack is visible not just among aggressive culture police, or hyper-sensitive community leaders, or fire-breathing nationalists, but elsewhere as well. The driver and guard of a local train can now be penalized for having asked for the credentials of a magistrate who decided to ride in the drivers cabin. It is not reason or fairness, but the hurt sensibilities of an individual or group, that can prick the law into action. Perhaps it is time the chief justice of India put in a word to remind everyone what the law represents.

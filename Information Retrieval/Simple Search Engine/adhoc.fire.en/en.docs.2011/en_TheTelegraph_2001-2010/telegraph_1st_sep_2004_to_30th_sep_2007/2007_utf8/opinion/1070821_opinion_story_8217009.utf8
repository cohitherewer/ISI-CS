The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LEAP BEFORE YOU LOOK

 Aveek Sen

 How terrifying Calcutta must be for those good people who are genetically programmed to keep an eye on the green man when crossing roads! In Britain, and in the Continent, as you move further away from the hot-blooded South towards the chilly North, you will see pedestrians, even in the dead hours of the night, when there isnt a single vehicle on the streets, standing patiently with their dogs, waiting for the green man to light up before they cross the road. I often found the sight comical and slightly pathetic especially that look of automatic and unquestioning obedience as they stand in the drizzle or fog being safe and civic. 

 Imagine those people coming out of their Sudder-Street hotels to taste the Calcutta night, confronting the crazily uncoordinated pedestrian lights on the Flurys-McDonalds end of Park Street. That hazardous art of not doing what the green man is asking you to do, but looking at the red lights instead in order to figure out when to cross the street, needs years of practice, of learning to take death in your stride and somehow come out unscathed. Calcutta is full of these dangerously out-of-sync green men who ask you to cross when it is most dangerous to do so. Think of the Ballygunge Phari, Hazra Road and Ballygunge Circular Road tangle (with a temple on the tramlines as witness to your peril), or the busy crossings all along Rashbehari Avenue. Is the technology for coordinating green men and red lights, so that pedestrians are not run over, impossibly complicated to handle? Is it beyond the grasp of even the Sector-V whizkids?

 While youre figuring this out, think of the taxi-driver who drove you to work yesterday. How, when he spotted a policeman, he quickly slipped over his head, like a sacred thread, his tattered joke of a dysfunctional seatbelt and then felt clever for the rest of the ride. The laws are all in place. But still, seatbelts in Calcutta are seen as protecting drivers from policemen and not from accidents, or from heads, faces and torsos getting smashed beyond repair.

 But the sweetest sight of all is the Happy Indian Family, nuclear but burgeoning, festively hitting the road on its two-wheeler. The father is in a magnificent helmet, looking invulnerable and futuristic. The mother is in lesser headgear one of those cherry-coloured, felt polo-caps with tiny holes along the sides and a little, add-on sun-shade. But the children are all bare-headed, one placed in the riskiest position in front of the father, another perhaps the favourite squashed between its parents, and yet another seated behind the mother, sharing the pillion and trying hard to keep awake, swaying drowsily, and menacingly, from side to side. Yet the parents are absolutely impervious to any sense of danger. They look like the blissed-out couples in life-insurance ads. How does one describe this state of being? A cow-like freedom from anxiety? Criminal idiocy?

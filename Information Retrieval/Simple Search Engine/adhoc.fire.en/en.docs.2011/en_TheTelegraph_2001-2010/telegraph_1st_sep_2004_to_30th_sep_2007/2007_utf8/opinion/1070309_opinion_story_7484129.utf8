 ANIMALS AND THEIR HABITAT

 Malvika Singh

 Ever since the prime minister set up a tiger task force, the depletion of the cats in the wild have increased phenomenally. It is now the turn of the lion to be poached mercilessly in its one and only habitat in India the Gir forest in Gujarat. The chairperson of the special group, which was to work out a way to save the king of the jungle from disappearing forever from India, has not been as vocal today as she had been when fiercely propagating her methodology for conserving the forests. The schemes have failed completely and the task forces recommendations remain on paper.

 With the new tribal bill having passed muster in parliament a bill that was the outcome of much lobbying by the Left the little that remain of Indias natural treasures will rapidly pass into oblivion. It is a reality that stares us in the face and nothing can restore the damaged and to-be-damaged environment. Politicians participated in the voice vote without having been through the additions and amendments that were made at the cost of the future of Indias forests. This is yet another glaring example of manipulation for short term political gain. 

 Without care

 Many parliamentarians believed, when they voted without having read the fine print, that six per cent of the land mass, the reserved forests, parks and sanctuaries would be outside the purview and jurisdiction of the bill. They were wrong and they should be held responsible for the land- and timber-grabbing that will follow. It is unfortunate that our representatives are unthinking. It speaks volumes about why we are in the throes of a serious social upheaval that could go out of control.

 It is time the national board for wildlife, chaired by the prime minister, the ministry of environment and forests, Project Tiger and the famed tiger task force told us why they have failed so miserably, why they are unable to do what they are paid to do and why they keep getting away with their failures. How come other countries across the world have been successful in dealing with poachers? How come those countries do not find solutions in closures of wildlife destinations? How come their task forces have been able to think and restructure carefully and creatively? Why do our schemes always fall apart? Is it because our leaders merely pay lip service to the concerns? Is it not better to come clean?

 Will to live

 Concerns that are not genuine or those that contradict the ones being voiced in the public domain, criticism of inaction, lack of understanding and so on, all invite the worst kind of assault on those who question failure. Threats and false charges are brought against those who cannot be either silenced or co-opted. Public authorities in India cannot, for some strange reason, agree to disagree after a debate and be appropriate in their behaviour thereafter. This is the sad truth of an authority that is fast losing its credibility and becoming insular by the moment. 

 This is another pointer to the anarchy that will soon prevail as people take laws and their lives into their own hands. Why do those who are in power become so disconnected, so selfish, such status- quoists? Why do they retreat from intellectual challenge? Why do they become so passionless? Is it just age and the exhaustion of a tired and failed generation devoid of fresh ideas and motivation to break new ground?

 The contrast between the authority that rules and the people who are victims of that malfunction is striking. One kills all initiative, degrades the space with its backward methodology while the other is full of vitality and energy, and finds ways to rise above the despair and live.

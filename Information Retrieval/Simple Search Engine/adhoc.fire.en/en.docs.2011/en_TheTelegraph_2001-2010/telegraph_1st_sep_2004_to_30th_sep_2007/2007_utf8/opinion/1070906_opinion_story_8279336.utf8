 SURVIVAL TACTICS

 Pakistan has perhaps never seen so much daredevilry in such a short spate. Only two months ago, pro-taliban militants in the heart of Islamabad openly challenged the authority of the Musharraf government through their siege of the Lal Masjid. The counter-offensive bloodied the presidents hands and set off a trail of suicide-bombings throughout the country, aimed mostly at the military that half-heartedly tried to combat a scourge the General had himself helped spread. And now, with the twin blasts so close to the defence headquarters in Rawalpindi, the militants seem intent on carrying their battle against the president right into his backroom, which, incidentally, has had a large part to play in their metamorphosis from pliant tools to a veritable threat to the presidency. Apart from further compromising Pervez Musharrafs position, particularly within the army itself, and making him feel even more unwanted as the political head of the country it is doubtful the bombings will send leaders scurrying into each others arms. Although the need for a political solution will be more keenly felt than ever, both within and without the countrys borders, it is unlikely that Pakistan will have it on a platter anytime soon. 

 It is actually time for some derring-do in Pakistan, and anyone who has a stake in the countrys political future seems to be trying out his luck. There is the president himself, willing to risk further alienation from the Islamist right in order to strike a deal with Benazir Bhutto and get another lease for his presidency. Then there are the two exiled leaders themselves, who think nothing about risking imprisonment or worse, losing their political colour, in order to seize the day. Take Ms Bhutto, who has already been branded a traitor to the cause of democracy by her rival, Nawaz Sharif, for responding to the dictators overtures. Be it the mismatched leadership of the Musharraf-Bhutto duo (if it at all comes about) or the right-supported dependency of Mr Sharif, continuing political instability, the opportunism of the army and the compulsions of the ruling elite will give enough chance for extremism to flourish and strike deeper roots. It is unfortunate that when the struggle for democracy has gathered its strongest momentum, the political leadership of the nation should seem hellbent on waylaying it.

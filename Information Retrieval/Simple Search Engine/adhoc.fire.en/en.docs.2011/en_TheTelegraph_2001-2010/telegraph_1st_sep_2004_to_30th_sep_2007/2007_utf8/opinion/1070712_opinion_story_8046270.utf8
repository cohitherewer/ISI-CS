 INTO A TRAP

 Armed rebellions create their own mystique. Dantewada in Chhattisgarh can today claim to have become what Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh had been in the Fifties and Naxalbari in Bengal in the Sixties the Hunan of India. But the sagas of these so-called Maoist uprisings in India have one thing in common they show the futility of the politics of violence. Like the Maoists of Chhattisgarh, their compatriots of other times had their successes in killing policemen and class enemies. But there the Maoists successes ended. Instead of helping their revolutionary cause, they ended up posing law-and-order challenges to the authorities. Demystifying the rebellion must, therefore, be the most important element in any strategy to combat the Maoists. A campaign to expose the absurdity of the Maoist movement can serve two important functions. It can keep the poor and mostly tribal people away from the rebels lure. Also, such a campaign can give the counter-offensive by the state greater clarity.

 However, Tuesdays carnage at Dantewada also shows how pitifully unprepared the Chhattisgarh government is to face the challenge. It is tragic that over two dozen policemen were killed. What is even sadder is that they seemed to have walked into a trap laid by the rebels. This could have happened only because of inadequate information, a wrong strategy, or both. This particular area in Chhattisgarh has seen several Maoist offensives in recent months. Clearly, the government and its law-enforcement agencies have failed to take the right lessons from these encounters. Unfortunately, an element of fatalism seems to cloud the governments view of the Maoist menace. The authorities appear to be resigned to the inevitability of such loss of lives from time to time. All that follows such killings are routine, knee-jerk responses. Nothing helps political rebels more than a defeatist approach by the state.

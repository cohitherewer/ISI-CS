The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HOLD ON FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER

 The CPI(M)s future strategy may depend on the success or failure of Jyoti Basus pragmatic line in the forthcoming conclave, says Ashis Chakrabarti

 Different take

 It was a couple of days after the central committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) rejected another of Jyoti Basus wishes this time of joining the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government. Basu had wanted the party to join the government and not just support it from outside. 

 I was returning to Calcutta from New Delhi after reporting on the deliberations at the central committee. On the flight was Basu, seated, as always, by the window on the left in the first row of the economy class. I scribbled a few questions related to the partys decision on a piece of paper and handed it to Joykrishna Ghosh, his comrade-cum-personal assistant, for Basus answers to them. I was told that Basu was not willing to talk about the partys decision. 

 Unwilling to leave it at that, I walked up to him. Before I had even put my first question to him, a grim-faced Basu looked up at me and said, Minority, minority, his tone betraying a mixed sense of resignation and indignation at the party overruling him yet again. He was obviously not in a mood to say more. The majority in the partys central committee did not support his argument for joining the government. 

 He had fought and lost another important battle within the party in 1996, when the central committee had to meet twice in two days to decide whether Basu should be allowed to become the prime minister of the United Front government. Basu and the then general secretary of the CPI(M), Harkishen Singh Surjeet argued that joining the United Front government would be the right strategy for the party, but failed to get the support of the majority of the central committee members. A historic blunder was how Basu later described the partys decision. No ordinary response this from a veteran communist who had an impeccable record of sticking to party discipline and to a Leninist partys seminal mantra of democratic centralism. 

 The reason why I recall the two most celebrated failures of the tallest man of Indian communism is that Basu, at 93, may have yet another tough battle on hand when the politburo and the central committee of the CPI(M) meet in Calcutta this weekend to take a final call on the Lefts stand-off with the UPA on the nuclear deal. An earlier meeting of the central committee in New Delhi had authorized the politburo to decide on what to do on the issue. But Basu was not present at the meeting. The meetings in Calcutta have been arranged so that Basu can speak directly to the politburo and the central committee members. 

 It is not as if Basu has a big difference with Prakash Karat on the issue of imperialism. The CPI(M)s political line has imperialism and communalism as the two greatest dangers on the international and the domestic fronts respectively. There are also no two opinions in the party that imperialism today means American imperialism. The party is also unanimous that the nuclear deal between India and the United States of America goes beyond nuclear energy and could signal an end to New Delhis independent foreign policy. 

 The question is whether the party should allow its position on the nuclear deal to overshadow its domestic political agenda and to dramatically change it. That is where Basu seems to have a different view from Karats or of those who agree with the latter. It is primarily a question of a tactical line. But then, tactical compulsions, rather than ideologies, are the real thing for Basu, who has always argued that what matters in politics is what works. And he would draw on the partys stated position to try and plead his case. 

 It is no secret that Basu does not want the current stand-off between the Left and the UPA to lead to a complete breach in the Congress-communist understanding. This is so not because he thinks that Congress-rule is the best thing that can happen to India. His case is based on the partys accepted line that the Congress is the best bet against the danger of communalism. The Lefts near-total absence from the political scene outside West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, according to him, shows how important the Congress is in the fight against communalism. 

 Just imagine the consequences, he would argue, of the Left parting ways with the Congress on the issue of the nuclear deal. In such a scenario, which party or parties would the Left support in the next Lok Sabha polls in the states in which it has no presence? Karat and his fellow-travellers in the party have their answer to the question the Left should align with the parties which could make up the so-called Third Front. That would be a repeat of the United Front experiment of 1996. Those in the CPI(M) who think like Karat would argue that the failure of that experiment does not mean that it cannot be tried again. They also say that the party would end up being permanently tied to the Congresss apron strings if it does not try the Third Front experiment ever again. Basu is not hugely enamoured of the Third Front idea, not because he thinks it is bad in theory, but because he believes that the present political context makes it unrealistic. 

 But what if such an experiment ends up helping the Bharatiya Janata Party and its partners in the National Democratic Alliance come to power once again? What if such a tactical line drastically reduces the Lefts own strength? Even the CPI(M) leaders admit that the Left would have to struggle hard to retain even half its present strength in the Lok Sabha in the next general elections. What if, even after the Lefts opposition, the UPA government goes ahead with the nuclear deal? And, finally, what if the next polls return the UPA to power in New Delhi and the Left is reduced to a ginger group largely irrelevant in national politics? 

 The politburo and the central committee meetings in Calcutta and Basus role in them could be important for yet another reason. The CPI(M)s real strength is in Bengal. Everybody knows of the intense factional feud in the partys Kerala unit between the supporters of the chief minister, V.S. Achuthanandan, and the state secretary, Pinarayi Vijayan. 

 The partys Bengal unit now thinks that its future is inextricably linked to its strategy for the states economic development in general and the current industrialization drive in particular. It is not merely Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees policy; the Bengal unit of the party had identified the states industrialization as its main political task. Discussions in the last three state conferences of the party centred mainly on the political and economic challenges to Bengals industrialization. The chief ministers passion for new investments derives directly from the party line. 

 If the chief minister had taken pains to build new equations with L.K. Advani during the NDA rule, it was because he wanted an easy relationship with New Delhi to facilitate Bengals industrialization. He has done the same with the UPA government. The results have shown in the investments that have come to Bengal in recent years. All that can go for a toss if the confrontation with the Congress over the nuclear deal takes centre stage in the CPI(M)s political strategy. 

 In 1996 and in 2004, the leading lights of the Bengal unit opposed Basu on the question of joining the government at the Centre. The political compulsions of Bengals economic development have brought most of them closer to Basu today. This could be reflected in the politburo and the central committee meetings in Calcutta. 

 Most CPI(M) leaders I have spoken to in Calcutta over the past few weeks have given me the impression that the party is trapped by its own position on the nuclear deal. They have no choice but to oppose the deal. At the same time, they know that it would not be easy for them to force the government to put the deal on hold for long. And, most important, they do not want to be pushed into a situation in which the party would have no option but to withdraw its support from the government. 

 For all Karats belligerence, the CPI(M) is hoping that the Congress will come up with a face-saver on the deal. On their part, the leaders from Bengal may try and persuade the politburo and the central committee to hold back from the endgame, at least for the time being. In this, Basu is their best bet. Which way the CPI(M) will go in post-nuclear deal politics may have much to do with the success or failure of Basus pragmatic line at the Calcutta conclave.

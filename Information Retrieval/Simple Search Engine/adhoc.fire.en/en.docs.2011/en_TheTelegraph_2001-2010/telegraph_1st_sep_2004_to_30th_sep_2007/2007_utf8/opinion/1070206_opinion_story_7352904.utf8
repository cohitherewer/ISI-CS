 RIFTS WITHIN

 There are endless debates on how to make democracy truly representative of the people. The trouble in Nepals Terai region is not merely about an ethnic divide between the people from the hills and those from the plains. The real issue is one of the peoples representation at different levels of the government. The madhesis, or the Nepalis of Indian origin, have some justification for claiming a greater share of jobs and administrative positions for themselves. But, the violence that erupted in the Terai can only harm their cause. The madhesis had marched in step with other sections of the people during the democracy movement last year. Understandably, they would like the interim government in Kathmandu to take care of their aspirations. But the gains of the democracy movement could be negated if self-seeking politicians are allowed to exploit ethnic passions. Ironically, the Maoists, who are now partners in Mr G.P. Koiralas government, had once fomented such feelings. They had raised the expectations of janjatis, or ethnic minorities, in a new Nepal. They had even been in favour of a federal administrative structure, comprising several autonomous governments. They may now face the fact that running a government could be more difficult than waging a guerrilla war. Their contradictory responses to the Terai agitation show how yesterdays rebels can fail as todays rulers. 

 For New Delhi, the situation calls for a cautious approach. The Terai region has a long border with the Indian states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. And, it is a porous border. While the economies of places on both sides of the border are closely linked, so are the peoples lives. It was tragically symbolized when two young boys in a town in Bihar were killed accidentally by bullets fired by the Nepalese police. New Delhi and Kathmandu must work together to ensure that the violence in the Terai does not cross the border. Also, some Nepalese politicians have complained of Indian hands in the Terai violence. They may have their own agenda in doing so, but the so-called anti-India card has long been a favourite ploy for some of Nepals politicians. New Delhis role in the recent agreements between the Maoists and the democratic parties had also been resented by pro-monarchy forces in Nepal. Instability in the Terai or anywhere else in Nepal would only help such elements.

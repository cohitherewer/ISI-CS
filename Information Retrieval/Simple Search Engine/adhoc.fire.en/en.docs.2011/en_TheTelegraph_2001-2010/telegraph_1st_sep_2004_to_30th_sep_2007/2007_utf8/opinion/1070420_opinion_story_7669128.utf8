The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SAME TRACK

 Exceptions have become the rule in West Bengal. It is not for the judiciary to look after the proper running of public utility services or assure a healthy environment for citizens. But precisely these make up the unenviable task of the court now. Days after the Calcutta high court enquired with the government about what measures it had taken to control air pollution, it asked the Eastern Railway to implement Section 144 of the Railways Act 1989, and regulate the free-run of hawkers on railway property. Both the orders follow from public interest litigations, which now appear to have become the sole weapon in the hands of the public against an uncaring government. The courts directive to the railway authorities would wrest for the passengers what is rightfully theirs the comfort of rail travel for which they have paid. Confronting a gaggle of vendors who furiously vie with each other to attract the attention of the buyer, crowd and dirty the platform and rail compartments, and often rob passengers is one part of the journey most travellers could do without. A ban on hawkers, quite obviously, would deprive a sizeable section associated with the profession of a wherewithal. But civic rights cannot forever remain captive to an illegality that has been allowed to prosper for the convenience of a few. If a substantial bunch of people now finds themselves at the wrong end of the stick, it is not the fault of the passengers. It is a failure on the part of the government, which could not provide these men with an alternative source of livelihood. And worse, it failed in its responsibility to provide them with proper licences, which would have legalized their enterprise. 

 The removal of hawkers from the platform has evoked the same reaction from their Left-affiliated unions as witnessed during the prolonged drama that followed Operation Sunshine. Political leaders and their respective parties are beside themselves with sympathy for the displaced vendors. The same gush of feeling for the dispossessed had forced the mayor of Calcutta to welcome back hawkers to the citys roads on the basis of an inscrutable regulation, and the ruling party to keep postponing action against hawkers, errant bus-drivers and polluting auto-rickshaws. Political opportunism could once again defeat judicial activism in case of the railway hawkers, and enable them to return to the tracks under the benevolent eyes of the state-managed railway police.

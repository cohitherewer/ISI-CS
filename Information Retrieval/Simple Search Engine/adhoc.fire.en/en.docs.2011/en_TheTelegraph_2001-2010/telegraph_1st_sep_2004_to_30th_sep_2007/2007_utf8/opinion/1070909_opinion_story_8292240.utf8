The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 GROUNDED FOR A WHILE

 Trust the Left to raise a political din that keeps investments in Bengal at bay. The denial of a second airport in Calcutta seems to be the first fallout of the tiff between the Congress and the Left on the nuclear deal between India and the United States of America. Neither side will publicly link the two. But Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would know this to be a consequence of the current political tension between Manmohan Singhs government and the Left. Over the past three years, the chief minister has known the benefits of having the right equations with the government in New Delhi, and especially with the prime minister. Such equations have helped him get past bureaucratic and procedural hurdles. It was not only the Lefts support to the United Progressive Alliance government but also the mutual understanding between Mr Bhattacharjee and Mr Singh that helped Bengal secure several development projects that had been long overdue. The understanding had derived its strength from both leaders commitment to economic reforms. But for such vibes between the two, the long-delayed modernization of the Indian Iron and Steel Company may not have been taken up by the Steel Authority of India. It was the prime ministers intervention that prompted Praful Patel, the civil aviation minister, to grudgingly accept Mr Bhattacharjees demand for modernization of the airport in Calcutta by the public sector company, the Airports Authority of India. The mutual trust between the two saw many other development projects in Bengal take shape. The tension over the nuclear deal threatens to undo much of that.

 Bengal paid a heavy price in the past for the politics of confrontation with New Delhi. The Marxists cries against a step-motherly Centre may have helped them come to power in 1977, but these did little to help Bengals economy. It would be a pity if Bengal were to pay again for the Lefts political battles against the Centre. In the Eighties, the Centre-state spats over the allocation of Central funds and over economic policies made the rulers in New Delhi hesitant to invest in Bengal. There is some truth in the Lefts complaint that the Centre took twelve years to clear Bengals proposal for the petro-chemical complex at Haldia. But, if New Delhi was somewhat obstructionist, the fault lay with the political antagonism that the Left nurtured. 

 In the changed political and economic contexts, it is unlikely that the prime minister will take a vindictive attitude towards Bengal. His government may not deny Bengal what is due to it. But Mr Singh may not go out of his way to favour Bengal or use his influence to ensure speedy clearance for the states development proposals. It is uncertain what the Left will gain by its new-fangled fight, but Bengals losses could be pretty obvious.

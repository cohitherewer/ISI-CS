The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MORE FOR THE BIG SHOPPER

 Why are the biggest retail outlets multiplying in the suburbs of the city, although their success is still uncertain? asks Sudeep Paul

 All that money can buy

 As you climb Sukanta Setu towards Santoshpur, a vertical oddity suddenly pierces the view to the right from underneath as it raises itself over the rooftops in the distance. It hasnt been there for long, but now, this giant residential complex is an intimation of the approximate location of Big Bazar. From Ruby General Hospital through Ajoy Nagar and beyond, the land adjacent to the E.M. Bypass is rapidly morphing into supermarkets, big and medium retail outlets and high-income-group apartment blocks. Yet, one look at the expanse beyond the intermittent high-rises reminds you that these fringes of Calcutta still remain middle and lower-middle class.

 Thus, as I passed by Spencers Super in the Avishar complex recently, I wondered why retail outlets are exploding in such gigantic splendour in the middle of the yet-to-be. While the Bypass gets a Super, historically up-market Ballygunge Circular Road makes do with a Spencers Express a fraction of the formers size. And Spencers does not offer a hang-out ambience like Big Bazar or City Centre for those with limited purchasing power.

 Confronted with these questions, S.S. Sekhawat, the marketing vice-president of Spencers Retail, asked me for 60,000 square feet on the ground floor in Park Street, along with a commercial licence and a landlord accepting cheque payment. And, oh yes, a 24-hour parking facility too. Apparently, the problem is not just space but also the terms of availability of that space. Park Street or Theatre Road cannot provide plots for a hyper market. Besides, a retail outlet dominated by food products will not make the money an Armani or a Versace store can. Economics too, therefore, is forcing large retail stores to be set up in the suburbs. Bengals land laws too are less clear than, say, Delhis, where there would be only one person to deal with and no problem of oversold land. 

 Retail officials I spoke to were unanimous that regulation was a political issue, not an economic one. Nevertheless, the politics of the matter is not merely the fear of agitation a la Forward Bloc versus Reliance Retail. The idea behind such regulation, as US courts have observed, is controlled growth and local development. Sekhawat told me that, given the right conditions, big outlets would not have to go to the suburbs (a point he seemingly contradicted later). Faced with a similar query from a journalist at the Confederation of Indian Industrys interactive session on September 17 in Calcutta, Bhartis Sunil Mittal had replied that small and medium formats should remain within the city while hyper markets needed to be located outside. 

 Armed with space, economics and government regulation on the list of determinants of the location of retail outlets, I set out for the Spencers Super on the Bypass. The next possible determinant called for a little exploration of a big store and its neighbourhood. This was the customer profile. To go by Sekhawats claim (and one that seemed to dilute the compulsion angle), big retail outlets should look to the suburbs given their growing affluence. High-income families are choosing to live there owing to low congestion and pollution as well as their access to private modes of conveyance. Well, the Spencers Super offered a split customer profile: the obviously upper-middle class residents of the neighbouring apartment complexes and others who had driven some distance up or down the Bypass to shop, as against humbler-looking lads from farther down the Anwar Shah Road connector. (I tried to see if the split was also reflected in the shopping trolley versus shopping bag duel, but that did not work out.)

 As a matter of fact, consumption figures released by the National Sample Survey Organisation in 2006, which showed that about five per cent Indians had a monthly per capita consumption expenditure above Rs 2,540, seemed to belie retail giants investments and their faith in the Indian middle class. Still rooted in the third world, with a GDP (PPP) mocking its economic-growth story, India is not anywhere close to the car-owning shoppers of the developed world who would drive miles to pick up their monthly or weekly groceries. Instead, we have the highest retail density in the world (approximately 15 outlets per 1,000 inhabitants) and a few big retailers depending on bulk-purchasing, low-frequency, high-income consumers. On the Spencers Super shop floor, apart from the affluent regulars, many customers were merely checking out the bargain offers and special discounts.

 It is perhaps too soon to credit the smaller Spencers or Arambaghs outlets inside the city over their bigger brothers outside. (Reliance Fresh stores have typically urban locations, but their Calcutta chapter is still on hold.) For the moment, all that is visible on the horizon is the dichotomy of Indias income/geography divide and the fact of big retail stores coming up in the suburbs in what is essentially still a gamble, and one that corporate retailers are not too happy about. Unless, of course, the curious middle-class shopper finally tires of the stench and filth of his local market. He would lose a vendor he may have known for decades and could banter or pick a fight with. He would gain hygiene, easy access to goods, ease of movement and peace of mind. But for his fruits and vegetables, there would be no rounding off 210 gram would not be 200, nor 240 gram become 250.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 On the verge of committing its fourth blunder, the CPI(M) seems to be at its obscurantist best. But there are subtle indications that things might not be so bad, and that the party could be changing after all. In its entire history, the party has never shown much fondness for the press. Scribes were never paid more than cursory attention, and biscuits never accompanied the tea served at press conferences. At the crucial politburo meeting, things were different. For the first time, a shamiana was put up for journalists and cameramen waiting in the heat outside AK Gopalan Bhavan. Fans were hung up to make life comfortable and even mineral water bottles were provided. Unthinkable really! A befuddled visitor to AKG Bhavan from the CPI office could hardly keep his surprise. He asked Nilotpal Basu what the matter was, only to hear this answer from an equally surprised Basu Our party is changing. For the meeting itself, the Tripura CM brought along sacks full of the best quality pineapples. These were not only distributed among the comrades (perhaps to sweeten their outpourings) but also among the journalists present. Wonder how long this particular honeymoon will last?

 Munnabhais release from Yerwada prison might have got stalled repeatedly because of administrative goof-ups, but the delay was less unsettling to Sanju baba than news of the bail being granted. If the stars close friends are to be believed, Dutt showed little interest in the undying efforts of his sister, Priya, to get him out. The logic was simple: he had prepared himself to spend time in jail after a lot of mental pain and anguish. The prospect of going out for a fortnight and then having to return agitated him no end. The sisters apparently had to rope in Manyata, Dutts girlfriend, to put some sense into him. But it is Dutts daughter, Trishala, who seems to have managed to convince Dad finally.

 It could be pure coincidence. But private channels in Bhopal are said to have started playing the Salman Khan-Sanjay Dutt starrer, Chal Mere Bhai, only moments after the Jodhpur court sentenced Sallu for a five-year jail term in the black buck poaching case. 

 Rajiv Shukla has been stumped. A newspaper columnist, member of the Rajya Sabha, board director of a film company all rolled into one, Shukla is also the vice-president of the BCCI and, in that capacity, is now touring England as manager for the ODI series. The other day, when the matter of his leave of absence from the upper house was taken up by the chairman, Hamid Ansari, everyone assumed it to be a mere formality. However, to everyones surprise, there was shrill opposition from some MPs, who protested against Shukla always choosing to neglect his duties as a parliamentarian for the sake of a sport. Earlier too, Shukla had absented himself from the house when he became manager for another England tour. The required leave was granted of course, but not before a protest had been registered. Was it loud enough, Shukla?

 Talking of Hamid Ansari, he definitely seems to lack the firmness of the former chairman of Rajya Sabha, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. Members are reported to have privately complained about Ansari behaving more like a stern schoolmaster than a self-assured presiding officer, sensitive to the concerns of the house on any given day. In fact, on seeing the bedlam on the first day, Ansari had apparently stood up in his chair and pleaded repeatedly with the MPs, who were happily engaged in a ruckus, to sit down in their respective chairs. Predictably, his requests went unheeded. Sitaram Yechury then is supposed to have sent him a piece of paper advising him to sit down. Ansari, suddenly made aware of his position, is said to have immediately obeyed the orders.

 AR Rahmans music is truly moving. 

 It has sufficiently moved a sub-inspector in Chennai to 

 move the Chennai court against the composers latest adaptation 

 of the national anthem. The PIL was rejected by the court, 

 but the cop still nurses a grudge against Rahman for commercializing 

 the anthem. Besides, the anthem, supposedly, could not be 

 extended beyond 52 seconds, while Rahmans stretched to 

 110 seconds. Finally, when the remix was aired, there was 

 every possibility that viewers would disrespect it by either 

 sitting down or not paying attention. The court seems to 

 have taken a dim view of the looming dangers. 

 Footnote

 If the Left is re-inventing itself, there is no reason why Didi should not. After having made up with Jyoti Basu with a smile and roses, Mamata Banerjee seems intent on patching up with Somnath Chatterjee. It is no secret that the two have been scarcely on speaking terms for a while now. There has been high drama in the Lok Sabha, resignation letters and suspension threats. So it was a bit of a surprise when Mamata stuck her head into the Lok Sabha speakers chamber one of these days and asked to see him. Somnathda appears to have called her in. Didi politely asked to be allowed to speak on the farmers issue and was, of course, granted the chance. Mamata spoke without making or inviting trouble. Even when Chatterjees proposal of no work, no pay for MPs was severely criticized and shot down recently, Didi, despite being opposed to the suggestion in principle, spoke no strong words against it. Now all that is missing are the roses.

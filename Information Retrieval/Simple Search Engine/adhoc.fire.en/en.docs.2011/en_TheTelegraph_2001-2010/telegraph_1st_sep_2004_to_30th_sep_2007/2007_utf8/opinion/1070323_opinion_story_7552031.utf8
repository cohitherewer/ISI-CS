The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LEARN TO VALUE

 Looking after monuments and antiques is more than a question of laws, money and bureaucracy. Central ministers and their secretaries might suddenly wake up to the unnatural ravaging of Indias cultural heritage (human beings are worse than Time in this matter), but making long lists (documentation, in bureaucratic jargon) and hefty and self-important budgeting (Rs 90 crore for a five-year project) will hardly make any substantial difference. Governmental thinking on cultural conservation, if at all it can be called thinking, is more antiquated than the antiques it seeks to preserve. So, apart from allocating money, the Central and state governments are most likely to be as clueless and ineffectually controlling as they have always been regarding these matters. Conservation from identification, documentation and curating to restoration, museology and marketing is a matter of very specialized and constantly updated knowledge, adapted to the conditions and requirements of a particular society and culture. Apart from the question of expertise and organization, the entire question of valuing artistic and architectural heritage is also a question of public or civic attitude.

 Paintings, sculptures and other kinds of valued objects, together with old buildings and monuments, become part of a societys historical and material culture because of a whole set of shared attitudes, awarenesses and sensitivities. These values cannot be created overnight with money and governmental or legal edicts. It requires a complex and efficient combination of education, technology, knowledge, management and political facilitation (without undue interference) that is best left to real experts, a whole range of them, in the field. Why restoring Rammohun Roys house, now in ruins in Calcutta, is as vital for the sake of the citys modernity and well-being as building a state-of-the-art foodmart has to be understood by most people who live in and are democratically invested with the guardianship of the city. No less important are those who have high commercial stakes in the modernization of a city. Indias often-unthinking infatuation with a certain notion of globalized urban modernity is bound to have an effect on attitudes towards the past and its material traces. Preventing this will have to involve considerably more than an erratic and arbitrary political will.

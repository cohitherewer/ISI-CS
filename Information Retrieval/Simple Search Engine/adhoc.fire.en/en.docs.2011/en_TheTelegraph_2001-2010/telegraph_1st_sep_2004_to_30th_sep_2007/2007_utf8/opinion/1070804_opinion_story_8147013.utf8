 LIGHT AND 

 SHADE 

 Anikendra 

 Sekhar Ghoshs maiden exhibition of photographs, titled 

 Colours of Solitude (till August 5), brings together a 

 collection of black-and-white images that dwell on still 

 life and its silence. There is a sombre, brooding quality 

 about Ghoshs work, and the prevalent mood seems to be one 

 of melancholy. But even sadness has its own beauty and depth. 

 Unfortunately, Ghoshs lens is not adequately sensitive 

 towards these qualities. There is a clever interplay of 

 light and shade in the pictures, but Ghoshs lack of versatility 

 injects a certain degree of monotony into the stills. Mercifully, 

 two photographs appear to have broken this frightening uniformity 

 the first is that of a row of hand-pulled carts on a Calcutta 

 street next to a couple of grimy, old buildings. One can 

 see a man in front of a cart, his face half-turned towards 

 the single file of stationery vehicles. Another image is 

 that of an old woman sitting on the floor of a room, possibly 

 a kitchen. A stack of utensils lies in front of her, while 

 an upturned water container rests in a corner. Light is 

 streaming in from two large windows, but, curiously, the 

 room is cloaked in transparent darkness. A word about the 

 venue. Rows of sofa had been placed in front of the walls 

 bearing the frames, which made viewing a difficult proposition. 

 One had to be careful, so as not to step on the toes of 

 celebrities, who sat chatting merrily on the settees.

 Talent hunt

 Apart from vigorous practice and 

 training under the guidance of able guru, it is very important 

 for a dancer to get the right platform to showcase her talent. 

 Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre deserves credit for patronizing 

 two young dancers Aparupa Chatterjee (Odissi) and Arupa 

 Lahiry (Bharatnatyam) on July 20 at Bharatiyam. However, 

 the organizer cannot afford to be insensitive and irresponsible 

 towards the performers. Lack of a proper music system, poor 

 time-management and light design marred the presentation. 

 Aparupa, disciple of Ratikanta Mahapatra, began her recital 

 with Ganesh vandana followed by pallavi, based 

 on raga Bagesree. With a pleasing stage presence, she explored 

 intricate rhythmic patterns with her clear tribhangi, 

 neat bhramari and crisp footwork. She proved her 

 mettle in abhinaya with an Oriya song Ahe neela 

 shaila. Intensive training and dedication were reflected 

 in her repertoire. However, her obsession with maintaining 

 the grammatical perfection affected the rasanishpatti 

 of the art form. Arupa Lahiry, a talented disciple of Chitra 

 Visweswaran, performed in the second half. She offered Vishnu 

 kavutam, ananda tandavam of Nataraja, the 

 conventional items of Bharatnatyam repertoire, with much 

 confidence. Sharmila Basu

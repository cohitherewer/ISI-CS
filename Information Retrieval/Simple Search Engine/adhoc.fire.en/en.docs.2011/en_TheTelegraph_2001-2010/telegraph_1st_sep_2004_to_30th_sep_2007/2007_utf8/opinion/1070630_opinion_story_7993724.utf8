The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SILLY MISTAKE

 All religions, it is politically correct to say, oppress women. That is true, but some religions are unrelentingly harsh on men too. A faith that forbids alcohol may turn a blind eye when men drink. But if the sin is compounded by the pronouncement of the word talaq three times, there is no escape. Jahiruddin Mollah knows that to his cost. In a drunken squabble with his wife, he pronounced the magic word three times. He did not mean it, nor did his wife bother. But the god-fearing young man confessed his slip to the priest, who stated that he and his wife, Sakina Bibi, were divorced and must live separately. If their divorce was unintended, then Ms Sakina Bibi must marry another man, consummate the marriage, obtain a talaq from him, and remarry her first husband. While this direction bears within it the principle of a freer life for the divorced woman than is granted in many other faiths, it is punishing for two men in two different ways. Besides, which woman would like to marry and divorce another man just to go back to her first husband? A principle of freedom becomes a violation of emotional and physical dignity when it is coercively applied. 

 This happened in Maheshtala, near Calcutta, in 2004. The couple, refusing to separate, were hounded out of their village and spent two years elsewhere. Now they are back, and their community and clergy have neither forgotten nor forgiven. In 2006, another such couple from Bhadrak, Orissa could continue their life together only after the Supreme Court intervened. In that case, the couples neighbours had complained against them. 

 The violence that underlies the responses of the clergy and the community in each case is nourished by contradictions. The verbal triple talaq is no longer accepted in many Islamic societies. Elsewhere, it is hedged about with safety devices, so no divorce happens without due thought. Also, many clerics in India consider a drunken call for talaq worthless. In Bhadrak, the first cleric the neighbours went to had been of this mind. So the neighbours appealed to another priest who forced the couple to separate. Beyond these immediate issues, there is also the bigger question of the functioning of the personal law. In the case of Mr Jahiruddin Mollah and Ms Sakina Bibi, local politicians of every party, of every faith, insisted that the laws of the community or community religion must be followed. The fear of angering the minority and losing their vote is dominant. Individuals become unimportant in this function of the personal law; their private choices and lives are violated at the communitys behest. This is only possible where the couple and their neighbours are economically and educationally underprivileged. The desire to control becomes all the more fierce when the sense of power springs from half-understood religious laws endorsed by local religious heads. But where should the larger, if notional, community, which believes in choices and freedoms, place itself when such a thing happens?

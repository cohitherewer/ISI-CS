The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ROUND AND ROUND IN VAIN

 Indian football has too many ailments for Sepp Blatter to cure, but there is still a market waiting to be exploited, writes Sreyashi Dastidar

 It still stinks

 Sepp Blatter and Mohammed bin Hammam could easily be more clued in to Indian football than some of the men who run the game in India. Most of these men are ministers or businessmen, or both. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, a Union minister who has been the chief of the All India Football Federation for as long as one can remember, had unveiled in June 2006 a grand plan which would take India to the final round of the 2010 World Cup. Less than a year later, on April 15, 2007, the president of the Asian Football Confederation, Hammam, looked down a hundred years from now and failed to see India making a mark on the global football scene even then. 

 The Fifa and AFC chiefs visited the three biggest Calcutta clubs, and watched an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match on Sunday. The dossier prepared by their research team had probably given them the low-down on Indian football well ahead of the trip, if not earlier (hence the meetings with the prime minister and president in Delhi). While in Calcutta amidst garlandings, dance performances and presentation ceremonies the controller of world soccer met those who are responsible for Indian footballs current shape, or the lack of it. Some of them have bribed and fought their way to official positions in clubs and associations. Unfortunately, once there, their political or business engagements have not left them with much time to think about the game. Those who spare a thought coaches, trainers and talent-spotters, particularly from villages and small towns did not get an audience with Messrs Blatter and Hammam.

 If the Fifa research machinery is indeed as competent as it appears, then it will have informed Blatter that association football in India is all about such conundrums. It has produced more sentimental literature some of it is in the form of newspaper reports than games worth talking about. The official website of the AIFF shows Indias descent from 157 to 165 in the Fifa rankings with a red arrow, as if it were a thing to be proud of. The talk about developing the game in a land where some of the clubs and tournaments are older than Fifa generates no irony whatsoever. The 30-minute power cut brought on by an electrocuted rat in the floodlit World Cup qualifier match between India and Japan in Calcutta in September 2004 is more symbolic of Indian football than the qualification for the 1950 World Cup. 

 But make no mistake about it, India in 2007 shines brightly in Fifas radar. When Blatter talks of Vision Asia and the Win in India with India programme, it is more than mere rhetoric. He does mean business. Literally. Which is why the most important appointment in the Blatter itinerary was undoubtedly the lunch meeting with the CII yesterday. The Indian subcontinent is too big a market for Fifa to ignore, particularly given its mediocre success in the other huge Asian market, namely China. It is not just Fifas global sponsors like MacDonalds or Gillette that is on Blatters mind. History of the sport must have taught him to strike the iron when the economic temperature is just right and in India it is the closest that it has come in decades. 

 The American economic boom of the Sixties did wonders for Latin American football. But is the Indian industry interested in investing in football, or shifting allegiance from cricket? The acutely perceptive man that he is, Blatter will have gathered the answer between kebabs and coffee at the CII meeting. He has all along been aware of the conflict of interests here, announcing in Calcutta that he has not come to India to take any wickets. But his timing of the visit might tell a somewhat different story. Fifa can spot a saturated market when it sees one the president himself claimed that looking to Asia was a natural consequence of the European market getting overloaded. There has been almost a decade of cricket overkill in India, and the national teams first-round exit from the World Cup set a near-perfect stage for Blatters visit. Add to it the fact that domestic football already has a wider base than domestic cricket, and Blatters smile might not seem inscrutable at all.

 There is a small catch, though: cricket is not quite footballs greatest enemy in India. The greater enemies lie within. The umbrella organizations in charge of the game in the country can never be accused of trying to change things for the better be it in introducing professionalism in club football, or identifying and promoting talent from the grassroots level. Old tournaments have been left to fizzle out when they needed to be revived, and new ones introduced whimsically without much impact. The AIFF rushed to announce the launch of Indias first professional league to time it with Blatters visit as if it takes no more than that to professionalize soccer in the country. Most clubs call themselves professional when they have no business using the term. Poorer countries have spent more on soccer infrastructure.

 Football is by no means a poor sport in India. It may not be flush with money like cricket, but it is still the second richest. Like most things in India, including cricket, soccer is also a case of money ill spent. It was not without reason that Blatter talked of Papua New Guinea he could just as well have said Faroe Islands or Guam begging Fifa for constructive help, not money. In the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match that Blatter and Hammam witnessed at the Salt Lake stadium on Sunday, all three goalscorers happened to be foreigners. It wasnt the best of advertisements for Indian football, but it also showed that there is enough money for clubs here to hire foreign players, even if many of them are African or Latin American rejects. But, deprived of the services of these stars, the national team ends up being an embarrassment. 

 Blatter repeatedly talked of promoting football in India as a game to bridge social, cultural, political and economic divides. The hint was, obviously, towards a Latin American model. But would such a model work in India? Probably not. Simply because no two regions in India would offer the same social-cultural-political-economic picture, which could then be beautifully unified with a spherical leather object. More important, Indians are not naturals at playing football in the way Brazilians and Argentinians are. But in a country of one billion and a few more, talent is never too difficult to find, although not even Sepp Blatter can ensure that such talent will start being nurtured now.

 Indian football, after all, is a microcosm of the Indian way of life, whose nature is to fly in the face of all attempts at organization and orderliness. But with the English, Spanish and Italian league football catching the fancy of young urban Indians, there might be something in it for Fifa to bring the likes of Manchester United, Real Madrid or AC Milan to play exhibition matches to sellout crowds in India. Since there is little chance of an Indian team evolving in the near future to put up a fight against international clubs, such a matches will have to involve two foreign sides. More stars, greater publicity, more revenue for Fifa and its sponsors all for a little work on the grounds and training facilities. If, in the process, a few home-grown players manage to develop their skills, then Fifa and AIFF can always share the credit.

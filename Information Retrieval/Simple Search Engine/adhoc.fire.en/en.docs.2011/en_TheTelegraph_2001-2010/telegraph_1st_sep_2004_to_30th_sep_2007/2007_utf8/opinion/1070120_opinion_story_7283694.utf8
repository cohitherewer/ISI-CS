 OPPRESSION SANS BORDERS

 THIS ABOVE ALL 

 KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Phoolan Devi: vengeance will follow

 Mukhtaran Bi is a beautiful woman living in a small village in Pakistan. Though uneducated, she knew the Quran by heart and taught it to little children to make a living. She is a Gujar. Most of the village land is owned by Mastois, who look down upon Gujars as low caste. Mukhtarans 12-year-old brother was suspected of responding to overtures made to him by an older Mastoi girl. Mastois caste panchayat hauled up Mukhtarans family and decided that for her brothers misdemeanour, she deserved to be raped by four Mastois. And so she was. 

 She lodged a report with the police. No notice was taken of her complaint. She complained to the press. The news was underplayed but appeared in some American and European papers. A foreign press-woman came to interview her. Her book, In the Name of Honour, became a bestseller. The royalties from the book and the money sent by admirers gave Mukhtaran enough to build a high school for girls in her village. She was invited to tour the United States of America and Europe. She has become a world celebrity.

 Many Indians who read Mukhtarans biography said, Such things do not happen in India. Unfortunately, such things have been happening in India for ages and are happening today. A parallel case with a different ending is that of the dacoit queen, Phoolan Devi. She was a Malhar (caste of boatmen). Whenever she passed by the village, Behmai, inhabited largely by Thakurs, young men would make lewd remarks at her. Then she was kidnapped, marched naked in the streets of Behmai and gangraped by Thakur men. She escaped and joined a gang of dacoits. She returned to Behmai with her gang, hauled two dozen Thakurs, stood them in front of a wall and shot them dead. Years later, after she surrendered, she was acclaimed as a heroine of the down-trodden. A book on her life was published. Shekhar Kapur made an excellent film, Bandit Queen, on her. She was elected to the Lok Sabha. One day, as she was coming out of her house in New Delhi, she was shot dead by a Thakur.

 If you are under the delusion that such things dont happen any more, take a look at the recently published book, Contentious Marriages, Eloping Couples, Gender, Caste and Patriarch, in Northern India, by Prem Chowdhry. Although her field of study is Haryana, she cites instances from other parts of India to prove that arranged marriages based on caste remain the norm while inter-caste and inter-religious marriages continue to be looked upon with disapproval. The term, love marriage is a misnomer and arranged love marriage a contradiction in terms. 

 Agricultural communities, be they Hindu, Muslim or Sikh, continue to stick to caste rules. Male elders reign supreme. They and their wives decide who their sons and daughters will marry. Defiance leads to ostracism and often murder. The buzzwords are izzat (honour) of the family, sharm (shame) of nubile girls. If a daughter elopes with her lover, her familys nose has been cut (naak kat gaee) and can only be put together by shedding the blood of the delinquent daughter and her lover. Prem Chowdhry cites cases of Jats, Rajputs, Sikhs, Meos (Muslims) to substantiate her thesis.

 The general perception shared by all communities is of women being like the earth in which a man sows his seed. He is the life-giver, she the receptacle in which the seed grows and becomes a plant. He always remains the boss. Defiance of authority entitles him to chastize his woman. It is the manly thing to do. Customs like forcing a widow to cohabit with her late husbands brother (chaddar) are born of this perception. 

 The folk hero of Haryana is Herphool Jat. He was a brigand who thought nothing of killing anyone who stood in his way. Herphool is the role model for Haryanvi Jats, just as much as the respected uncle or taoo.

 Inter-caste marriages are rare enough, inter-religious marriage almost unknown. Only those degraded by college education descend to such depths. A Haryanvi folk song deals with them: 

 He Brahman ki chhoree, kalij mein

 padhan bithaaee

 Hey Mussla ka chhora dono aankh

 ladaaee

 He kaagaz pe mitthaee dono nay

 ral-mil khaaee

 Hey uskey baap aur bhaee dono kee

 laaj mitaaee

 (A Brahmin girl was put in college/ She exchanged glances with a Muslim boy./ Together they ate sweets wrapped in paper/ Dishonouring both her brother and her pater.)

 Prem Chowdhurys book is well- researched, well-written and informative. The only lacunae I could detect was the absence of reference to the Bishnois (Bhajan Lal, the ex-chief minister of Haryana, is one), who are sizeable in number and have matrimonial customs of their own.

 Justice at last

 I salute the high court bench

 That restored faith in the majesty

 of law

 And turned acquittal into firm 

 conviction

 By denuding a judgment of its flaw.

 I salute the ordinary, agitated citizens

 Who demonstrated, shrieked and 

 cried

 Held candle vigils and organized 

 campaigns

 Against what they felt was justice 

 denied

 I salute Bina Ramani (who unlike 

 some witnesses)

 Did not resile from her narration

 Whose courage to chase the killer

 Won even the courts admiration.

 But start with me.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DADS ARMY

 Defeat produces irrationality. This is ironic since a post-mortem, which should follow a setback, is by definition a rational process. A spurt of emotional and illogical reactions has followed Indias exit from the World Cup. In this outburst the coach of the Indian cricket team, Greg Chappell, has been made the convenient fall guy. Nobody seems to remember that Chappell was not given the kind of team he wanted. In an interview to The Telegraph, immediately after the team for the World Cup was announced, Chappell had suggested that he had been given an old team in which there were players who were liabilities on the field. He had added that an observer could easily think of the Indian team as Dads Army. It has now been revealed that in an SMS sent to a journalist after Indias debacle, Chappell has confirmed that he had fought for a younger team but had been overruled by the senior players and the chairman of the selection committee, Dilip Vengsarkar. It is impossible to argue that a younger Indian team would have performed better than what an ageing one has done. But with a younger team, there would have been the opportunity to prepare for the future. Now the Indian cricket team is left with a handful of fading and disgraced stars and a bunch of demoralized youngsters. Add to that a frustrated coach under the threat of dismissal and the picture of gloom is complete.

 This pathetic situation grows out of a collective myopia that has adversely affected vital areas. One is that no one in the cricket administration, including the chairman of the selection committee, is concerned about building a team for the future. One condition for building such a team is the willingness to make immediate sacrifices for future harvests. This calls for a certain amount of fearlessness. But our senior players and their patrons in the selection committee cower when faced with criticism that any defeat inevitably brings. The second problem is the refusal to accept that the role of the coach in cricket is much more enhanced than it ever was in the history of the game. The coachs role is critical from the selection of the team to planning and strategy to implementation. Till this is realized and accepted the best that will be achieved is breast beating and looking for scapegoats. Selectors and cricket administrators must abandon their Dads Army mentality.

 Letters to Editor

 High return

 Sir With hard work and dedication, Sourav Ganguly has made a spectacular return to the Indian cricket team (Sultan of series, Feb 18). He made a significant difference to the team in South Africa and has now been one of the architects of the victory in the one-day international series against Sri Lanka. It is difficult to imagine that this same person was stripped of his captaincy and considered unfit to play for India. Indias youth, especially students and budding professionals, should draw a lesson from Gangulys comeback. Teachers in Indian schools might also consider using it as an example to motivate weaker students. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir The Indian team has returned to form and rediscovered how it feels to win a series. This victory will do the infamous Indian confidence a world of good going into the World Cup. The greatest story to have emerged out of the last two series is that of how Sourav Ganguly handled his professional crisis and recaptured his place in the team. His batting has always been a treat for cricket-lovers, and it was good to see him play some of his trademark shots again. Gangulys partnership with Yuvraj Singh in the last one-dayer against Sri Lanka in Vishakhapatnam reflected their perfect understanding and command over the opposition. This spirit must permeate Indias batting, bowling and fielding if the World Cup is to be brought home after 24 years. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir Indias two consecutive victories over Sri Lanka and the series win should be a great morale-booster for the team. While it is important that doubts over Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh have been laid to rest by their performance at Vishakhapatnam, it is equally significant that Sourav Ganguly emerged the most consistent batsman, winning the man of the series award. However, Irfan Pathans form continues to be a worry for the coach and the captain even as the rest of the team seems to have peaked. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partha S. Chatterjee, Andul

 Sir The headline, Sultan of series (Feb 18), in praise of Sourav Ganguly, must have pleased every fan of the former skipper. Ganguly had been humiliated and unfairly treated by the previous team management and the selection committee headed by Kiran More. Thankfully, Ganguly and his fans had not lost hope. His dramatic return proves that will and tenacity pave the path to success. One only hopes that Ganguly will hold on to his current form and take India to victory in the West Indies. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashis K. Bhowmick, Calcutta

 Sir Sourav Gangulys return to the Indian team is indeed something to be happy about. It is also great that he became the man of the series against Sri Lanka. But is this news important enough to be put before all other local, national and international news in The Telegraph? The infatuation of the Bengalis with Ganguly has already made them a laughing stock for the rest of the country. Why, Chandigarh did not go berserk in welcoming Kapil Dev on his return from the 1983 World Cup.

 Yours faithfully,

Mayajit Mazumdar, Kharagpur

 Sir Sourav Gangulys match- and series-winning performance proves that his killer instinct is still intact. Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell the duo believed to have been instrumental in keeping Ganguly out of the team had no option but to praise Dadas efforts. But Ganguly must make sure that he retires from international cricket after the World Cup. There is nothing better than to go out on a high note. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir After a successful stint in South Africa, Sourav Gangulys man-of-the-series performance against Sri Lanka in the just-concluded one-day series has conclusively proved that he is still a champion in both forms of the game. It is interesting that Ganguly was dropped from the team before a series against Sri Lanka, and it is providence that his one-day comback was fashioned against the same team (Windies wind in Sourav sails, Feb 18). Are the pundits who wrote him off willing to eat their words?

 Yours faithfully,

Debasish Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The verdict on political vandalism by a Tamil Nadu court comes at a time when West Bengal needed it most (Death-row message to political vandals, Feb 17). Political vandalism and the attendant mayhem happen at the drop of a hat in this country. A judges remark that the political masters should be made to pay the price of such misdemeanour is welcome. Leaders should be made to compensate the victims and the state, especially if such incidents involve loss of lives and destruction of property. Unfortunately, Indian courts are yet to come down heavily on the perpetrators and sponsors of such extra-constitutional action. The death sentence to those responsible for the loss of three young lives in Tamil Nadu in 2000 sends a clear message to politicians and their ilk. It would be interesting to watch what the ruling party in Chennai which has opposed capital punishment in the parliament attack case says about the death sentence given to members of their political opposition. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

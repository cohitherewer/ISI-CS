The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A QUESTION OF FAITH

 At the end of another black Friday in India, 13 people lay dead in Hyderabad. Of these, reportedly four were killed by police bullets when the police failed to control enraged mobs in the city. The others died in Mecca Masjid in a bomb blast that came towards the end of Friday prayers. Need any of this have happened? In spite of the acknowledged difficulty of policing a country as vast as India that is vulnerable to terrorist attacks of many kinds, the answer should still be no. There is something almost predictable about the timing. It may be too early to say whether the blast was planned to coincide with the day that the sentencing of the accused in the Mumbai blasts case was due to begin. But there has surely been more than enough blood spilt in Indias recent past to arrange for particular care to be taken on that day, especially in such important mosques as Mecca Masjid, in a city communally as delicately poised as Hyderabad. This would not have been new. After the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, holy places in Hyderabad had been placed under special guard during prayer time. The militant presence there is not in doubt and there have been a series of explosions in the past few years.

 It is no use musing on the similarity of the Mecca Masjid blast with those in Malegaon last year. Malegaons Kabaristan on the eve of a major religious feast and Delhis Jumma Masjid were both attacked on two Fridays last year. The absence of the police near Mecca Masjid during prayer time and, once again, the failure of intelligence are shocking. But perhaps not unexpected. While the mob fury that also exploded in Hyderabad cannot be condoned, it is time that the insecurity of the minority community was addressed. The States responsibility does not end with a recitation of a list of militant groups with links to Pakistan which could be guilty. It has to protect its law-abiding subjects. Minority communities might well suspect the State of indifference towards them, and feel that it refuses to see them as victims too.

 The quality of their insecurity is most movingly illustrated by the reaction of a Malegaon survivor: how is it possible to pray in gods house when one is fearing for ones own safety every moment? The Delhi Minority Commission chairman has suggested that all angles be looked at to determine whether the militants who killed and maimed people in Mecca Masjid are Muslim or Hindu extremists. It may be remembered that a little episode of explosives bursting accidentally in a den of Hindutva followers sometime before the Malegaon blasts was carefully glossed over later. Forensic smartness the knowledge of precisely how the bombs are made is useless without a single suspicion being proven true, especially on the part of those who never seem to have any intelligence prior to a major blast. The only sign of hope is the apparent maturity of ordinary people: communal hostility does not always automatically follow an incident such as the one in Mecca Masjid.

 Images on water

It is difficult to comprehend the quality in Manu Parekh rsquo;s paintings on Benaras that inspired seven essayists to wax eloquent on the series. Most of canvases reproduced in BANARAS: ETERNITY WATCHES TIME (Mapin, Rs 2,000), look like garbled blotches of blue, black and red with sudden splatterings of yellow and white. The tottering domed structures that dot the landscapes are supposed to evoke the temples of Benaras. Unfortunately, they look more like lighted wigwams being pulled down, against their will, by the force of gravity. The preponderance of the primary colours and their arrangement sometimes recall the paintings of Marc Chagall. But the suggestion is lost in the random swirls of colour almost as soon as it presents itself. One despairs of the lsquo;spirit rsquo; of Benaras which is claimed to be manifested in Parekh rsquo;s paintings. This is a detail from Evening at Banaras.

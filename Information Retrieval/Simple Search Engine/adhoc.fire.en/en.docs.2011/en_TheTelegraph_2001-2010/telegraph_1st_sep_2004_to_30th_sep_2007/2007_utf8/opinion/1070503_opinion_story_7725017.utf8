 KILLING SPREE

 Even in a democracy, there is nothing more fearful than State power. The people of terrorized Kashmir and Manipur have lived with this truth for some time now. The sordid details of the fake encounter deaths in Gujarat, which have led to the arrest of three senior police officers, merely reaffirm it. There is, seemingly, nothing extraordinary about policemen putting their heads together to plan, and neatly execute, the murder of a suspected criminal. In fact, the abduction and killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh, his wife, Kauser Bi, and a friend (the last two were eliminated to remove the evidence), turned out to be an inter-state affair, with the alleged collaboration of the Andhra Pradesh and the Rajasthan police officials. Ever since the Punjab police demonstrated the effectiveness of encounter killings in bringing down the number of crimes and criminals in the Eighties, this has become a much-favoured mode of police action throughout India. A proven success in Kerala and Bengal even before that, it is now used methodically in dealing with the Naxal threat in Andhra Pradesh or against the less-organized criminals in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and elsewhere. It is thus only natural that the hoopla over a perfectly mundane State affair has mightily upset the chief minister of Gujarat, who has directed more substantial police operations against the enemies of his state and come up trumps. 

 The concern, however, is not with Narendra Modis future. There is already proof that the controversy, far from being the cause of his undoing, could further bolster his public image prior to the assembly elections by turning the matter into a colourful state-versus-Centre conflict. The concern is with the future of the Indian State itself. What assurance of safety can it give to its citizens when such safe-keeping is entrusted to a personnel, which is given the power to undermine the most basic human right the right to life? The police are there to provide security, to nab criminals and to hasten the process of justice. In India, they have been turned into a killing machine to further the vested interests of the incumbent power. Be it the National Security Act, the Prevention of Terrorist Act or the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, each bestows on the men in uniform the power to disregard with impunity the rights of the people. No wonder extra-judicial killings, custodial death and torture are such accepted truths.

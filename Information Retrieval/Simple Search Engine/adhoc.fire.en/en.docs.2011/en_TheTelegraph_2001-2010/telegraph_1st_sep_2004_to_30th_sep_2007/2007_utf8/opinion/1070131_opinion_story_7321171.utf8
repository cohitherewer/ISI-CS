 THE CHOSEN ONE

 Moscow is determined to remain Indias biggest arms supplier so as not to surrender old spheres of influence to the US, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Three is not a crowd

 Hours before his passage to India to attend the anniversary celebrations of the founding of the Indian republic, the Russian presidents hand-picked parliament in Moscow passed a law banning casino gambling in the capital.

 For Russias oligarchs, fattened by the landslide transformation of the economy over the last decade, it was a case of both shock and awe. Clearly, the president, Vladimir Putin, used to playing poker since his days in the KGB, was sending the message that despite this being his last year as president, he was still willing to risk cleaning up the landscape.

 The ability to smell out a good wager Middle Russia will, no doubt, welcome the casino ban was on full display during his two-day visit to India. The Russian president announced that Moscow would help New Delhi set up four more nuclear power plants at Kudankulam in south India. He also announced that Russia would build a multi-role transport aircraft and jointly produce a fifth-generation fighter aircraft. The two days when Putin was in town, the smile on Indias face kept getting bigger and better.

 Still, what boggled the mind was that it was Russia, Americas Cold War rival, that was first off the block despite the fact that it had been America that had, single-mindedly, broken through the international nuclear order so as to give India the implicit status of a world nuclear power. The American president, George W. Bush, had personally underwritten the transformation of India by persuading the non-proliferation lobby to change the laws so as to allow US companies to sell nuclear equipment and nuclear fuel to India.

 The president even allowed India to keep 8 of the 22 nuclear power plants in a secret, military programme. The remaining 14 nuclear plants would be open to international inspection, so that other nations could also compete to sell fuel and nuclear equipment to India. After Bush let India have its cake and eat it too, it was Russia which walked away with the first contract Putins country would help India build four nuclear plants.

 Moreover, Russias deputy prime minister, and a Putin loyalist from St Petersburg, had also announced that India and Russia would not only jointly produce a fifth generation fighter aircraft reportedly to take on a US-European joint venture but that Moscow would also participate in an international tender put up by the Indian air force to buy 126 fighter aircraft.

 Russias ambassador to India, Vyacheslav Trubnikov, pointed out that, for this contract, the Russian MiG-35 would compete with the US-made F/18-A Super Hornet fighter planes, besides the French Rafaele and the Swedish Jas-31 Gripen jets. The Russian fighters, he informed, were at least half as cheap as the American planes. Just over a month ago, in the run-up to the US Congress amending its own decades-old law that allowed the sale of nuclear fuel and high-technology to India, it had been widely speculated that the tender for the 126 fighter jets, worth $6 billion, would be a political quid pro quo from India to America. It was to be a thank you present from the Indian establishment to the Bush administration, one defence analyst had informed. But with the Russians openly bringing their MiG-35s to the fray, the return gift to America becomes that much more difficult now, he added.

 Moscows determination to maintain its position as Indias number one arms-supplier means that it is no longer willing to surrender its old spheres of influence to the United States of America, its arch-competitor. Considering the fact that 75 per cent of Indias military hardware is still Soviet in origin, the Russians say they want to capitalize on this advantage.

 At a time when India and the US are celebrating their newly-minted friendship, Russias decision to revive old ties with India has added a sparkle to the new great game in Delhi.

 Political observers point out that Americas interest in an India growing at more than 8 per cent annually is aimed at capturing her large and booming market. Besides, from the US point of view, India would then have the potential to become a competitor of China.

 Russias renewed interest in India, as well as in Iran, central Asia and the Middle East, is a function of its willingness to flex its muscle as it rides on a resurgent economy boosted by its enormous oil-and-gas revenues. It is this willingness to compete with its erstwhile rival in new pastures like India that is creating a flicker of irritation in Washington.

 However, if truth be told, a new Russia, supported by its oil-and-gas revenues rather than by earnings from gambling, is aware that its desire to sell India nuclear power plants can only come true if and when the Nuclear Suppliers Group amends its guidelines for India. India has so far been on the NSG prohibitory list for all nuclear-related aid, because it had refused to sign the non-proliferation treaty. Moreover, it is also clear that the NSG will only amend its guidelines in favour of India if the all-powerful Americans allow it to take such a step. Clearly, the key to the Russian sale of nuclear goods to India still lies in American hands.

 Nevertheless, Putins Russia has other aces up her sleeve, including the sale of oil from the Sakhalin-1 gas field on the Russian pacific coast to India, besides pushing for the construction of a gas pipeline from Iran to India via Pakistan, in which the Russian gas company, Gazprom, has a stake.With India hardly possessing any energy sources of its own, its economy needs large amounts of energy to maintain its growth rate.

 Putins decision to roll the strategic dice in the Indian capital has attracted quite a few raised eyebrows. Back home, Putin is not alone. Gambling is both a Russian pastime as well as a national passion. Both Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky apparently knew what they were talking about.

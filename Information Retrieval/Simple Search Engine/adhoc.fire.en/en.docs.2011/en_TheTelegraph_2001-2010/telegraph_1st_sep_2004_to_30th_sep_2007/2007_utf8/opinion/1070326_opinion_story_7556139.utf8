 HOT AND STICKY

 The economic man has reason to be befuddled. Last July, the Reserve Bank of India issued a warning about inflation, and raised its prime interest rates. Since then, it has taken steps four times to restrain growth of money supply as well as to raise the cost of money. The finance minister was nonchalant about inflation and intent on high growth. But by early this year, even he could not ignore the inexorable rise in prices. He reduced a few import duties; but he carefully omitted from the list agricultural commodities, although a rise in food prices is what concerns the common man most. His action was patently inadequate; inflation actually went up after his measures. It would have looked strange if he had ignored it while making the budget. So the Economic Survey took the view that the inflation was due to a shortfall in the supply of a few agricultural commodities, notably wheat and pulses; and Mr P. Chidambaram said that the remedy was to increase their supply. However, since their supply came in a single annual crop, one could only wait for the next crop. The prices might go through the roof in the meantime; but if the finance minister was right, they would come down when the crop came in. In the budget, he chose products like pet foods, diamonds and watch dials to reduce import duties on; it suggested pork-barrel politics rather than combating of inflation.

 Now Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, has declared that there are signs of the economy overheating; Mr C. Rangarajan, one of the prime ministers advisers, echoed him. Thus economists close to the prime minister are clearly taking the view that inflation was an urgent problem, and that its primary cause was excessive demand. The most effective instrument to curb demand would have been the budget. Mr Chidambaram has just let go of a chance to use it as such. It has been argued that the budget was deflationary because it projected lower expenditure growth than revenue growth. This was not the result of deliberate policy, but of the fact that the budget adhered to the relaxed programme of deficit reduction that Chidambaram laid down for himself two years ago. He could still revise his stance, for the budget has not yet been passed by parliament. It would be unprecedented if he were now to raise taxes; but he still has the chance to cut expenditure. But given his laid-back position on inflation, it is unlikely that he will do anything. 

 On this question, there is a distinct cleavage between the prime ministers office and the finance ministry. Inflation is more a political problem in this country than an economic one. So the prime minister should be asking whether he can afford the finance ministers expansionism when the economy requires tucking in. He must curb the latters exuberance, sooner rather than later.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 OMINOUS SOUNDS

 Operation Silence, that ended the weeklong siege on Lal Masjid, does not symbolize a resounding victory for the Pakistan president. The order, which took time in coming, was nothing exceptional under the circumstances. The religious fanatics and militants inside the mosque had undermined the authority of the government, openly challenged it and, in contravention of all norms of humanity, had sought to use women and children as shields against military action. The Pakistan government could no longer afford to delay a purge of the mosque and be ridiculed further. The inevitable bloodbath, which Pervez Musharraf could not prevent despite trying so hard, quite expectedly, has brought its own set of problems. In the days to come, Mr Musharraf will find himself trying hard to answer difficult questions about his own governments role in fomenting the crisis. But the more pertinent reason why the fall of the mosque will add no feathers to the generals cap is that he will continue to be perceived both as the friend of militants as well as that of the West. Neither role is best suited to his interests. 

 The operation against the mosque, which had emerged as a major cog in the wheel of terror, is likely to establish the general more firmly in the radical imagination as a puppet in the hands of Western powers. The backlash could be severe, particularly if Mr Musharraf continues to indulge the mullahs in order to minimize the threat from pro-democracy liberals. Already, his political opponents, Nawaz Sharif among them, are said to be regrouping with fundamentalist political forces. However, it is his perceived role as the friend of militants which could be more damaging for the president. The publicity surrounding the activities of the mosque, and his own moderation towards militants before that, had proved beyond doubt that his government was downplaying its role in the war on terror. A lone operation against a militant stronghold is unlikely to change that perception completely. Perhaps Mr Musharraf understands this problem. Which is why Operation Silence in Islamabad is being quickly followed up by military deployment in distant Swat and the re-occupation of check-posts along the Afghanistan border, where the Pakistani-taliban is supposed to be active.

 However, the general ought to realize that it is not merely his war on terror that is the central concern of the world. Pakistans stability is of utmost importance, and that can be ensured by greater democracy. It would assuage the generals liberal dissenters, promote development and keep talibanization, and religious and sectarian violence on hold. Unfortunately, that would be the least of Mr Musharrafs concerns as he gears himself up to wrest another mandate soon.

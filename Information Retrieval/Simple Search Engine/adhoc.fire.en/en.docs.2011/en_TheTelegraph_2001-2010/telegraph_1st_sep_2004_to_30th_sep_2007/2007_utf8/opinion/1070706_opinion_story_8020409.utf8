 WRONG DUTY

 Before a toast is raised, the fine print should be read and the implications considered. Initially, it is natural to rejoice at the fact that the government of India has reduced duties on foreign wines and spirits in compliance with the World Trade Organization commitments. Such a reaction may be based on the reduction of actual duty from about 550 per cent at the highest level to 150 per cent flat for wines or from 230 per cent to 100 per cent for spirits. But these reductions will not reflect actual reduction in prices since they do not take into consideration state excise duties which will still be levied. This factor is important since the government of India has advised state governments to levy excise on foreign liquor at the same level as domestic spirits to protect the domestic liquor industry. In other words, foreign liquor will not enjoy a level playing field with its domestic competition since it will be subject to customs duties as well as state excise levies. Which means, the swadeshi lobby, despite appearances to the contrary, has triumphed, and the government of Indias promise to abide by the WTO commitments is no more than an empty gesture. Indeed, what the Central government has given with its right hand, it has taken away with its left by advising the states to levy excise duties on foreign liquor at the same level as domestic liquor.

 The only advantage to come out of the governments gesture to the WTO will be greater and easier access to international brands and labels. But these brands will not be available, alas, at international prices. This, in fact, violates one of the fundamental premises of the WTO regime. There is no reason why an Indian, fond of his single malt whisky or of French wine, should not be able to enjoy his favourite tipple at the same prices as his counterparts in London, Paris and New York. In terms of overall policy orientation, Manmohan Singhs government is an upholder of a globalized economy and a liberalized trade regime. But on specific issues foreign spirits and wines being a telling example it refuses to comply with the basic conditions of globalization despite being party to fora like the WTO. This doublespeak is difficult to fathom. It would be understandable if the government fell back on Gandhian principles and believed that imbibing alcohol is immoral. But its preference for domestic liquor over foreign liquor can only be seen as a throwback to an antiquated mindset that privileged Indian-made over foreign-made.

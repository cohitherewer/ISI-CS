 Street Legal 

 Minor matter

 A man challenged a high court order directing him to pay maintenance for his children. He contended that at the time of the divorce, he and his ex-wife had signed an agreement according to which the children would stay with their mother. They had decided that the mother would look after the children and not ask the father for any maintenance. Punjab and Haryana High Court held that parents could not take away, even by agreement, the statutory right of minors to claim maintenance. The court ruled that the law could not enforce an agreement that is adverse to the interest of minors (Mohender Singh vs Ravneet Kaur and another).

 Getting the goods

 An insurance company refused to pay compensation to the family of a labourer who died in a truck accident. It claimed that the condition of the policy had been violated because the man was travelling as a passenger in a goods vehicle, which is not allowed. The widow pointed out that he was travelling as a coolie with the truck, a point that the company did not deny. Bombay High Court ruled that since it had been established that he was travelling as a coolie mdash; not as a passenger mdash; in the goods vehicle, there had been no breach of conditions. Therefore, the insurance company could not refuse compensation to his heirs (New India Assurance Company Ltd vs Bijalabai Maruti Dharange and others).

 Marriage annulled

 When a woman started behaving abnormally from the wedding night itself, her husband grew suspicious. Later, he found out that she had undergone treatment for recurrent attacks of schizophrenia. So he filed a case, asking for annulment of the marriage as his wife was not normal. Bombay High Court ruled that as schizophrenia is a continuous and incurable disease, the marriage could be annulled, under Sections 5 and 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act (which state that if consent for marriage is obtained by fraud, the marriage can be annulled), as the man had been kept in the dark about her illness (Vandana J. Kasliwal vs Jitendra N. Kasliwal).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT WORTH IT

 Indefinite deferral is the least honourable form of evasion. This is possibly the fourth time that the meeting of the group of ministers entrusted with working out the modalities of a television licensing fee has been postponed. Obviously, the ministers feel mixed up about the whole thing. Their knee-jerk response is to want to levy the tax, but they know that times have changed since the Fifties and it is difficult to pull off these measures nowadays without looking regressive, dour and clueless. Hence, the information and broadcasting minister has emphatically and categorically denied any plan of levying a tax on TV and radio, yet the talk of such a possibility somehow remains in the air. The idea of financially restructuring Prasar Bharati from what such a cess might fetch the government should be laid to rest without further delay. And if this proves to be fatal for Prasar Bharati too, then most TV-watching Indians would agree that the nation would not be losing an invaluable cultural institution.

 Few would disagree that, as an autonomous public broadcaster, Prasar Bharati has increasingly proved itself to be a rudderless ship trapped in the most dismal of commercial, political, cultural and technological backwaters. So why should the taxpayers money go towards funding an institution that has little profit and even less delight to offer them beyond anodyne propaganda and outmoded entertainment? When private TV channels have managed to keep most audiences to them through every kind of enterprise and ingenuity, then it is doubly unfair of the government to expect to be funded by viewers (and manufacturers). First, Doordarshan must rectify its standards in order to justify asking to be paid for what it is providing. Second, the kitty, if there is to be one, has to be proportionately shared by all service-providers, instead of being hogged by the governments channel. When it comes to cricket telecasting contracts, parliamentary coverage, terrestrial television and short-wave radio, Indias broadcasting policy is yet to reflect critically on its Neanderthal ways. Add to that the I amp;B ministrys prudish and high-handed attitude to programme content, and what the country is looking at is a government that needs to rethink its monopolist paternalism. Dropping the habit of sporadically dredging up the license-fee idea would be a sensible start.

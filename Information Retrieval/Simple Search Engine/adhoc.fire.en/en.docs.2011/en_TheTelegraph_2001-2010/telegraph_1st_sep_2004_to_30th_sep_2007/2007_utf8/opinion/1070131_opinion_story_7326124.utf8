 CLEANING UP

 A political crisis can also be an opportunity to re-examine ideas and issues. The postponement of the elections may have stalled the democratic process in Bangladesh. But it has also given the administration, the political class and society in general an opportunity to take a fresh look at the electoral system. Democracy may not be only about the people using their franchise once in five years. A free vote is the basic requirement of democratic politics. The high court in Dhaka may have, therefore, wanted to help the cause of democracy in the country by deferring the elections by at least three more months. The court wanted the time to be used to clean up the electoral rolls. Clearly, the Election Commission had failed on this score when it announced a poll schedule earlier. It is not easy for any administration in Bangladesh to reach a political consensus on any issue because of the sharply polarized politics in the country. The clean-up of the electoral system is, however, more important than partisan politics. Unfortunately, the past five years of Begum Khaleda Zias rule saw politicization of the administration on an unprecedented scale. Not just bogus voters, a politically biased administration too could reduce the polls to a farce. 

 However, the big question is: who will clean up the mess? For all practical purposes, the army has been running the administration since a state of emergency was declared in Bangladesh earlier this month. Tired of months of political turmoil and violence in the streets, sections of the people welcomed the armys intervention. This public sentiment was reflected by Mr Mohammed Yunus, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, during his visit to New Delhi this week. But it could be simplistic to over-emphasize the armys role in restoring a democracy. It would be more so in a country which has unhappy memories of army takeovers of civilian governments. As soon as it has ensured the end of street violence, the army should return to the barracks. The restoration of democracy should then be the responsibility of the civilian administration and the political parties. The emergency has robbed Bangladeshis of most of their basic rights. The restoration of the political process will mean nothing until the people get back these rights. Before they can vote, the people must be free to speak.

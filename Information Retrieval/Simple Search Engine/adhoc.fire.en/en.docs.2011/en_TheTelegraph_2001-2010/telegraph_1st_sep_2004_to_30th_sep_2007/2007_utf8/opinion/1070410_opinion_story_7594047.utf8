 Letters to Editor

 Untying the knot

 Sir The ruling by the Supreme Court that a unilateral decision by a husband or a wife not to have children is reason enough to grant a divorce, leaves many questions unanswered (Thou shalt not abstain nor refuse to have children, March 29). First, can there be any policing on what goes on within the conjugal space? Subterranean tears in the relationship might be taking concrete shape in the refusal of a spouse to have a child. A divorce, by putting an end to the relationship, does not redress the problem. Besides, a vital aspect of the case that led to the judgment seems to have escaped notice. Jaya Ghosh, the wife of the appellant, Samar Ghosh, was a divorcee with a daughter when she married for the second time. The presence of her daughter could have influenced Jaya Ghoshs refusal to have another child. These are two important aspects of the case which should be borne in mind while implementing the judgment. Judicial intervention in marriages should bring succour to distraught couples and their children instead of fuelling the gossip mills. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Men, for their own benefit, should not encourage the verdict of the Supreme Court. It is they who will lose out in the long run if they choose to have more than one child with spouses who are working. If women (their reproductive rights severely compromised by the judicial ruling) are to have children against their choice, they will need to take frequent maternity leaves. That would leave the men working twice as hard to compensate for the scarcity of staff. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir In an age when women are expected to work shoulder-to-shoulder with men, child-bearing often works as a constraint to a womans career. Men have to suffer no such discomforts. It is expected that a working womans husband will understand her stand, if she chooses not to have a child, rather than file for a divorce. The apex courts decision will further weaken womens position in society, since more men than women are likely to sue for divorce on the ground mentioned by the court. Women will be disempowered to a great degree if they are not allowed to take the vital decision concerning their body and reproductive functions on their own.

 Yours faithfully,

Sunanda Sen, Calcutta

 Sir To be divorced is quite fashionable these days. Bickering couples file for a separation at the drop of a hat, often on insubstantial grounds. However, if one partner denies a child to the other, then the couple deserves to be separated. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Procreation is the basis of marriage as a social institution. A marriage will remain incomplete if the husband or the wife decides not to have a child. This will also cause either of the partners to seek gratification, even parenthood, from an alternative relationship. This will ultimately break the marital bond. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Forbidden truth

 True to life 

Sir The decision of the government of Maharashtra to put on hold sex education in schools is a welcome move (Dangerous habits, April 1). There is no need to give children lessons on sex since everybody becomes conscious of the sexual organs and their functions quite naturally in the course of time. Making sex education a part of the syllabi in schools would only result in killing the innocence of childhood prematurely. 

 Yours faithfully,

Moumita Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir Doing away with sex education in schools once again proves the hypocrisy of Indian politicians. Their sense of morality is not outraged when movies, in which sex and violence abound, are churned out by the dozen by the film industry. They are themselves often caught in the act on camera but they will not allow students to acquire a healthy knowledge of sex. It is the lack of proper understanding, coupled with the dangerous images viewed on films and television, that have resulted in the rise of teenage crime. But ministers would rather turn a blind eye to the reality than confront it.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Datta, Calcutta

 Sir In order to contain the AIDS menace, many state governments are contemplating the introduction of sex education in schools. But it would be wrong to assume that awareness of the dangers of unprotected sex, communicated in the classroom alone, will ensure safety. On the other hand, too much information on the subject before children are ready for it may corrupt them. In such a situation, the Maharashtra governments decision to ban sex education seems to be a practical one. 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir Cultural contact with other countries, in these days of globalization, does not necessarily entail the erasure of one culture by another. Teenagers in the West might display their affections openly or engage in pre-marital sex. But this does not mean that their Indian counterparts will act likewise. By the same logic, sex education cannot become a part of the school syllabi. Adolescents in India will not emerge wiser for being taught about sex in schools, whatever educationists in the West say.

 Yours faithfully,

M.K. Anwar, Calcutta

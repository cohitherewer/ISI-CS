 THE NAMING GAME

 WORDCAGE

 Can language alter geography? 

 Given the old-fashioned notion of geography, you might 

 think so: most languages have their own names for foreign 

 places, regardless of what the foreigners who actually live 

 there may think. Certainly, so used, language can reflect 

 politics; many a government has tried it. But lets reverse 

 the question: can, and should, geography alter language?

 English, the leading tongue of 

 Western imperialism, was naturally happy to tell other people 

 where they lived, witness any map of the United States of 

 America or Canada, Australia or New Zealand. Even my modest 

 atlas lists some 25 geographical entities worldwide named 

 after Queen Victoria. Rhodesia owed its name to that arch 

 empire-builder, Cecil Rhodes; its capital, Salisbury, not 

 to the British city but to Lord Salisbury, a British prime 

 minister of the time.

 Yet the British did not rush into 

 the linguistic takeover of more advanced bits of their Empire. 

 In India, indeed, as Clive once impudently claimed of his 

 depredations there, they could stand astonished at their 

 own moderation.

 The Western name for India long 

 predates the British: 1,900 years ago, a Roman poet wrote 

 of psittacus eois imitatrix alis ab Indis the 

 parrot, the imitative bird from the eastern Indies. The 

 British gave the subcontinent tiny Macleodganj and grander 

 Campbellpore, reminders of the countless Scots who largely 

 ran their Empire. And Coxs Bazar, Everest, and the McMahon 

 Line. Yet little else, whatever recent name-changes might 

 suggest. Fort St George was a typical 18th-century colonial 

 name; not so Madras, which it grew into. Linguistically, 

 theres nothing English about Bombay or Calcutta, Benares 

 or Bangalore.

 Natural right?

 Most often, the British simply 

 anglicized Indian names in the spelling of the day. At times, 

 oddly: Ganga became Ganges (Ganjeez), the HimaLAYas were 

 so pronounced and stressed. But Poona is as good as Pune, 

 Oudh as Awadh, even if most of todays Britons would rhyme 

 it with loud. Likewise, Punjab (and a lot better than the 

 Poonjab of some broadcasters more familiar with the sound-values 

 of modern transliteration than with India).

 English names these days are everywhere 

 on the retreat, mainly for political reasons; Rhodesia is 

 now Zambia and Zimbabwe, Salisbury is Harare. Even Nyasaland, 

 only half-English, became Malawi. (Soweto remains, however. 

 Naturally, you might think a typically African name. Not 

 so: it began life as South-West Township).

 Its happening even in the British 

 Isles a name itself contested by the southern Irish. They 

 long since turned Queenstown into Cobh; now in the north, 

 the Protestants Londonderry is losing ground to the Catholics 

 plain Derry. Drive west from London to Newport, and as you 

 cross the Welsh border, the road-signs suddenly talk also 

 of Cas Newydd the citys name in a tongue not used by 

 two Newport citizens in a hundred.

 Europe has seen plenty of this 

 linguistic politicking, especially after 1945. Ancient Danzig, 

 a hot spot in 1939, reappeared as the Gdansk of Polands 

 future Solidarity trade union, and umpteen other once German-named 

 places now have Polish ones. The break-up of the Soviet 

 Union had a like effect, as Ukraine and other new countries 

 paraded their independence. In Asia, Saigon became Ho Chi 

 Minh City, and Yerushalayim is challenged by al-Quds.

 Yet all that is indeed politics. 

 The real oddity is different: the way one nation or language 

 gives its own names to the geography of others for no evident 

 reason at all. Is this linguistic arrogance, or merely exercise 

 of a natural right? Ill be back to these issues in two 

 weeks time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 If intelligence sleuths are trying to take a look at the guest list for a party, surely a Gandhi must be on it. And so it was, at the birthday party of a Delhi socialite, where not one, but two Gandhis Rahul and Priyanka were invited, apart from the usual Page 3 suspects. A few guests had taken the liberty to bring along some firangs, one of whom happened to answer to the name of Massimo Quattrocchi. The hostess was as much in the dark as the Gandhi siblings about how Quattrocchi Jr landed in her lawn. The young man who is known to have been buddies with Rahul and Priyanka once upon a forgotten time had no malicious intent evidently. Or else, why would he go up to Rahul and Priyanka and offer his greetings, as if his surname didnt matter? But the siblings were not impressed, and made sure their displeasure reached the hostess. Intelligence officials later traced Mr Qs presence to a businessman guest. But, having been made to feel squarely unwelcome,the guest revealed that he had left soon after with his Italian acquaintance in tow. And missed the dinner? Too bad!

 The BJP seems to be in no hurry to capitalize on its sudden stroke of luck in Punjab and Uttarakhand. Factionalism continues unfazed, and the party president carries as little weight as before. Thus, it seems to have taken little effort on the part of Arun Jaitley to decline the offer to head the partys front in election-bound UP and station himself in Meerut. It would have meant a demotion of sorts for Jaitley since Rajnath Singh has divided UP into two segments, and already given eastern UP to Anant Kumar to oversee. The legal eagle is said to have opted to take charge of the Delhi municipal polls instead. Unlike UP, the Delhi civic polls are bound to be a cakewalk for him. Good thinking, Jaitley!

 A proven failure as party president, Rajnath Singh is as good a father as most of his political colleagues, cutting across party lines. He seems all set to launch his son, Pankaj Singh, in politics. That is the reason being cited for the pact between the BJP and Apna Dal, the Kurmi party of Sonelal Patel. It would give Pankaj the chance to be fielded from Chirai Gaon, a Kurmi- dominated assembly segment in Varanasi.

 A picture tells its own story. Take for example, the picture of Maulana Azad on the wall of Shahnawaz Hussains room in the BJP party office. Azad may be turning in his grave at his appropriation by the saffron glam-boy, but Hussain is not easily dissuaded. If Sardar Patel, despite being a Congressman, could become the BJPs posterboy, so can the Maulana. After all, was it not Azad who prevented the mass exodus of Delhis Muslims to Pakistan? Hussains colleagues are mightily amused at the developments. They say that perhaps Najma Heptullah (who never fails to flaunt her associations with Maulana) has finally met her match. The picture on the wall of Priya Ranjan Das Munshis room again tells its own tale. It is one of the Congress party president, smiling down from the wall on all visitors to Das Munshis room. Madams presence, so close to the Bangali babu, is bound to take his name in the sycophancy register several notches high. But one cannot be sure if protocol allows a Union minister to put up the picture of his party president in his office.

 Murli Deora is a Gandhi in the making. He is one of that rare breed of politicians who do not lay claims to a bungalow on the assumption of political office. Even the simple-minded S Jaipal Reddy shifted to a swanky bungalow the moment he was made the urban development minister. Deora continues to occupy the same house he has been living in for the past two decades. Even if one were to dismiss his tyag as an indication of his prejudice, one cannot explain his reluctance to claim an office in the Parliament House complex. Many junior ministers, holding charge of insignificant ministries, have appropriated office space. But not Deora, who seems unconcerned about such worldly matters.

 The budget postmortem continues. Questions are being raised about why the finance minister suddenly increased taxes on the purchase of private jets. Is it because his ministerial colleagues-cum-rivals Dayanidhi Maran and Kamal Nath were contemplating on buying them?

 Is it that parliamentarians take interest only when they are paid to ask questions in the house? Why then do they go missing after having filed their questions, particularly when a query is listed as starred, a status which only a few select questions are accorded? The high-flier liquor baron, Vijay Mallya, had extremely relevant questions to ask about the upcoming new international airport in Bangalore. It was starred for a verbal response. Strangely, Mallya went missing when his name was called to take up the question from the minister concerned. One cannot say if the sudden ebbing of enthusiasm had anything to do with his realization that a query about civil aviation from the owner of an airliner could provoke ridicule. A few years ago, Jaswant Singh, as finance minister, had refused to answer a query about the hotel industry from hotelier Lalit Suri. But if Lata Mangeshkar had regularly attended parliament and asked questions about the music industry, would her question have been as misconstrued?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HOT UNDER THE COLLAR, AND LOVING IT?

 MERCURY RISING

 Why should cricketers have to sweat it out in subcontinental summers?

 Conditioning camps are not things to remember, but what would the just-concluded one in Calcutta be remembered for, if at all? The ordinary newspaper-reading man would perhaps recall Rahul Dravids bloodied nose and Sachin Tendulkars twisted ankle. But for those who sweated it out for five days (particularly the ones who fell sick), the heat will surely be the dominant memory of the camp. Which brings into question the prudence of holding such camps in such conditions. Of course, the matches India will play in Bangladesh will take place under similar heat and humidity. The camp in Calcutta, thus, seemed to make perfect sense.

 But to see it in these terms would be to lose sight of the larger question: should there be any cricket under such taxing circumstances? In which other sport are players made to stand, run, jump under a blazing sun and humidity touching 100 per cent, for close to eight hours? The only other sporting activity where the players are expected to be out in the open for as long is golf. But obviously, a golfer gets long breathers between shots, and most of the worlds important golf tournaments are played at that time of the year when the weather of a particular venue is kind to the players.

 Any cricket follower will know that cricket began in the subcontinent as a winter sport, and old loyalists of the Eden Gardens still find it difficult to disentangle the smell of orange peels from their memories of watching cricket at the ground. It is another story that oranges have long been replaced by plastic bottles and missiles which can be hurled into the field whenever the going becomes unpleasant for the home team.

 To come back to the question of playing cricket in subcontinental summers, it would be no exaggeration to say that the phenomenon is inseparably tied up with the economics of the game. Cricket administrators in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have found out that spectators will flock to the grounds in rain or scorching shine, if the superstars are playing. This rather skewed pattern of global market economics makes an insoluble problem of one which could have had a simple enough solution.

 Most readers may have already guessed what is being hinted at. During the months that the heat and humidity are unbearable in the subcontinent, teams from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka could go on tours of England (where cricket has always been for the summers), Australia, New Zealand or South Africa (being in the southern hemisphere and hence enjoying winter). Once the rains get over around late September in large parts of the subcontinent, cricket could resume again with home series against overseas teams. Easy and doable as all this may sound, there isnt enough profit in it for our Asian cricket boards. And so, the players must be flogged into agreeing to play five- and one-dayers so what if they fall sick in the camps, have to install ice-packs under their helmets, and generally have a near-death experience?

 There is an even simpler solution. The players can put their foot down, and make their boards come round to seeing the absurdity of things. But if youve watched the Indian cricketers through the contracts controversy following the World Cup exit, abandon such thoughts. It will take no less than a death from dehydration (on-field) for anything to change in a hurry. God forbid!

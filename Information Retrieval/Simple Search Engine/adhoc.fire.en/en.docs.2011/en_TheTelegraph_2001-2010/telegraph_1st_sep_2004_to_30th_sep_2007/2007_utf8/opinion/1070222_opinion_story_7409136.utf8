 ITS COOL TO SPEAK LIKE EM

 WHOS CALLING?

 How Young India is unlearning the English it learnt at school

 It took three wannabe starlets and a sniffling Bollywood diva to make Indians feel proud of their accents. In Big Brothers house, Jo OMeara, Jade Goody and Danielle Lloyd drew tears from Shilpa Shetty, and blood from native and non-residential Indians, when they mocked, among other things, the latters Indian accent. After bouts of apology and righteous anger, the girls hugged and kissed each other, and Shetty came home with the 12 crore that her wrong accent had earned her. 

 Ironically, back home, its the right accent that helps young Indians graduates, students on correspondence courses, college dropouts, young people idling after college, and the unemployed earn some money. And certainly, there are many who turn this into a career. 

 Business process outsourcing and call centres across the country have become shining testimonies to a Shining India touched by the magic of globalization. As more foreign investors and companies decide to transfer their clerical work to India the National Health Service of Britain is the most recent example Young India becomes increasingly enamoured by the money and glamour involved in call centre jobs. The foreigners get cheap labour, the natives go home purse-proud, with a reassuring sense of belonging to the New India of shopping malls, i-Pods and swanky gizmos. The bonus is, of course, the American or British or even the Australian accent they pick up at work.

 But just picking up isnt good enough a word to describe this phenomenon. Before Young India starts impersonating a First World accent to earn the trust of foreign customers, it has to undergo accent training for a few months. Its like a paid holiday, explains Tania Bhattacharjee, who has worked as an accent-trainer for a Gurgaon-based firm. The trainees attend practice sessions five days a week, where they are taught grammar and usage, introduced to phonetics, and asked to memorize hundreds of sound patterns. The latter is the most crucial element in accent-training, determined by the customer-country. A slip could be costly; if you sound like an Indian pretending to be White (thats what Goody and Co. accused Shetty of), you lose the trust of the customer. With a fake accent you could be considered incompetent, or worse, an impostor. This training can either polish or distort a persons English-speaking abilities, Bhattacharjee concedes, We try to make the trainees unlearn whatever English they have learnt in schools. How, then, do these lessons in mimicry affect the personality of a young trainee? If you are Young India, hooked on to the latest gizmos, want to be cool, look like a fashion model on a billboard, then this is your dream come true. Trainees, particularly those from socially deprived backgrounds, might enjoy the glamour and the money in the job. They dont mind the odd hours (even though they might need sedatives to sleep after nightshifts), and they dont care if India signs the nuclear proliferation treaty or if Shilpa Shetty is called a Paki.

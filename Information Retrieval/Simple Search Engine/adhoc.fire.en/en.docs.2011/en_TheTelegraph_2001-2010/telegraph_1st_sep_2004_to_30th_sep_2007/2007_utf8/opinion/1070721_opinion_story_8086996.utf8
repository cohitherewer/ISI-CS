The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ON A LOW BUT 

 STEADY NOTE 

 Nilaksha Gupta

 Music

 Impressive performance 

 Sangeet Ashram presented Manilal 

 Nag, possibly the seniormost performing sitar player of 

 Calcutta, in an evening recital at G.D. Birla Sabhagar on 

 July 13. He was supported on the sitar by his well-known 

 daughter, Mita Nag, and accompanied on the tabla by Samar 

 Saha.

 The main item was alap, 

 jod, jhala and gatkari in raga Jaijawanti. 

 Manilal Nag opened up the raga by playing two of its three 

 main phrases right at the beginning. His daughter, Mita, 

 however, reining in the tempo a bit in her first foray, 

 brought in a little slower and more detailed melodic development. 

 Nag seemed to respond and the mode, more or less set by 

 the daughter, tended to prevail throughout the 18-minute 

 alap. His pitch wavered a bit at times in the tar saptak. 

 Mita Nag, playing accurately, 

 more than compensated for this first sign of ageing shown 

 by her father in the recital. Still, since the volume of 

 her microphone was kept low for unknown reasons throughout 

 the evening, she did not sound as impressive as she does 

 in her solo recitals.

 The microphone factor became more 

 apparent during the rhythmic taan-toda played by 

 the duo in the jod. Manilal Nag played with vigour throughout, 

 with occasional, slightly rough edges being the only reminders 

 that he was well into his late sixties. The full impact 

 of Mita Nags taan-toda, on the other hand, did not reach 

 the listener because of the low volume of her microphone, 

 but it was clear that she was playing very well. The duo 

 went on to play ulat or reverse jhala and rounded 

 off with some more taan-toda.

 The vilambit teental gatkari 

 went on to a vigorous development of rhythmic patterns 

 after the initial melodic forays. Both the artistes played 

 impressively, the father with his occasional roughness and 

 the daughter with her lower volume. The patterns were rounded 

 off with a variety of tihais. Samar Saha, playing 

 the tabla with his usual skill, did not seriously try to 

 repeat or reply to the rhythms or tihais of the sitars, 

 but played patterns of his own with impressive bayan 

 work.

 The vilambit gatkari ended with 

 another round of taan-toda. There was no saath-sangat. 

 This used to be a regular feature of Manilal Nags recitals 

 in his heyday. The drut gatkari, also in teental, 

 settled down to clear, four-stroke sulat jhala, the 

 hallmark of the final part of Manilal Nags recitals. Here 

 he again had some problems with the pitch of the high sadaj. 

 The final piece of the recital 

 was a Pilu dhun and ragamalika, starting with 

 an aochar and going on to rupak tal gatkari that 

 had to be ended rather abruptly as time was running out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WHERE HAS 

 ALL THE KINDNESS GONE?

 While Tina Mukherjee, a model, was molested and assaulted on a busy city street recently, none from the crowd stepped forward to help. Can we still think of Calcutta as the most caring and benevolent of Indian cities?

 Too many people in Calcutta lack 

 employment or occupation. And on this rests the reputation 

 of Calcutta being a helpful city. At any given point of 

 time, you will find men dangling their legs from the Maidan 

 balustrade and gazing at the couples canoodling on the greens 

 or at women bathing in the Manohar Das Tarag. Such men almost 

 invisibly frequent the streets and bylanes of Calcutta, 

 and seem to appear out of the woodwork when an accident 

 or a brawl takes place, or any form of human misbehaviour 

 is noticed. They are called the public in Bengali. 

 If there is a major accident, one half of the public helps remove the injured to hospital, while the other half collects crude implements like iron rods and bricks and goes about damaging as many public vehicles as it can. If the accident is a minor one, the public forms an impromptu court to pronounce judgment and even award penalties. No one is supposed to question its locus standi. But the public has been going missing of late. Tina Mukherjee realized this recently. An elderly man collapsed on busy Bentinck Street some months ago, but with no public to help him, he passed away on the pavement. Has there been a significant rise in the employment rate among Calcuttans recently?

 It has been argued that if the 

 individuals entrusted with enforcing law and order did their 

 job, the public could go back to their idling. There is 

 much truth in this. But must we always assume that the publics 

 intentions are noble? In the small huddles that form every 

 time there is an incident on the streets, there is sometimes 

 a more sinister game being played than we can imagine. Caught 

 at a traffic signal at the Minto Park crossing recently, 

 I saw a brand-new Swift being overtaken and stopped by a 

 motorcycle-rider right in the middle of the line of moving 

 traffic. The motorcyclist got down, and without a word, 

 pulled out the owner-driver of the car and started hitting 

 him. A dozen-strong crowd gathered in no time, and some 

 of them joined the motorcyclist in his act of violence. 

 The traffic policeman remained steadfastly aloof. It was 

 difficult to see what the Swift-owners fault was, but he 

 could not have hit the motorcycle because its rider betrayed 

 no signs of injury. But the crowd had already decided that 

 the affluent owner of the Swift was in the wrong. When 

 the lights turned green for my line of traffic, blows were 

 still raining on him, but, surprise of surprises, the motorcyclist 

 was already pretending to make a move. I could not stay 

 back to watch money being extorted from the car-owner and 

 divided among the members of the public.

 CREATURE DISCOMFORTS 

 I find fascinating the way 

 people watch captivated when dogs copulate on the streets 

 of Calcutta. Living up to their reputation of being good 

 Samaritans, people will generously vacate a respectable 

 amount of space even on a busy street for the dogs to perform. 

 Once the spectacle is over, they will shake their heads 

 in pity for the hapless animals, who are such unashamed 

 slaves to their desires, and then disperse reluctantly. 

 The gleam in their eyes and the stupid smile on their faces 

 say that they have savoured every moment of the opportunity 

 to watch something akin to a blue film for free.

 The attitude changes drastically when a dog, or any other animal, lies injured on the street. Insofar as the spectacle of an animal writhing in agony is concerned, people tend to take pleasure in it in the same way that they enjoy the scene of two lustily panting dogs. The crowd that collects around a wounded creature will generously offer advice on the best methods of treating it, but will refrain from actually doing anything to help it. I, along with a friend of mine, was once witness to a puppy being knocked over by a running rickshaw. As the rickshaw sailed away, the pup collapsed in a heap on the road with blood streaming from its nose. The bystanders launched into a discussion about the menace posed by reckless rickshaw-pullers while the pup languished before them. The hysterical cries of my friend for help were met with the cold counsel that the mangy stray is best left to its fate.

 But for every insensitive Calcuttan, there is perhaps a concerned one. Another friend of mine nursed a dog hit by a taxi back to health. The blithe indifference of the average Calcuttan to wounded animals is not surprising. We, after all, walk with a straight face past meat shops where skinned and bloodied carcasses hang in display. It might be my imagination, but I seem to detect a savage glint in the eyes of men who stand with folded palms around an animal being sacrificed. It is similar to the perverse flicker in the eyes of men who gather to applaud dogs making love.

 ON THE MOVE

 The people of this city almost 

 lose their character when they step into the precincts of 

 the Metro. The gutka or paan is surreptitiously 

 spat out into the narrow channels of water running beside 

 the steps leading to the counter. Used coffee cups are thrown 

 into large bins, where they are supposed to lie. The queues 

 before the counters are always orderly, although much bile 

 is spent on their slow progress. And there is almost no 

 contest for the seats on the platforms allocated for women, 

 the elderly and the handicapped. The men manage to wrest 

 them. 

 The seeming order remains undisturbed till one can sense the approaching train. Then all hell breaks loose. The women, denied their platform seats, now wait for their chance to grab the double rows in each bogie that are reserved for them. As for the elderly, they never had a chance anyway. They are at a definite disadvantage when the automatic doors of the train open and the wild crowd surges in, flitting right or left in search of a seat. Calcuttans, famed for their civility and kindness of heart, feel little remorse in pushing aside a slow-moving Auntyji or Dadu when they are so determined. The little gap between seats, towards which the Dadus and Didas often move with hope, is quickly filled up. The push from seat-seekers at either end is too much to bear for the tender-hearted, who may try to make space for the old hips to squeeze in. If old bones find rest, but in the wrong seat, then it cannot be helped. The urge of a college-going teenager to rest her legs is often stronger than that of a granddad. So he heaves himself up apologetically, and the sprightly figure in jeans quickly takes his place. 

 There is not much consideration shown for children either, especially those who do not quite make the cut. So children in sequinned salwars, with smudged kohl and wonder in their eyes, never have a place offered to them, no matter how difficult it is for them to keep their balance and desist from clutching at the dress of the primly-dressed office-goer. Parents, heading back to the mofussil after a trip to Kalighat, with infants on their laps often get a hollering for allowing their childs little shoes to brush against the clothes of the person seated in front. No one is willing to let go of a seat. City-bred toddlers returning from school have a little more luck. All of them are expected to fit into one seat that might be vacated at times. But they are often too busy with themselves to care, letting matronly figures take full advantage of their obduracy.

 A PREMATURE METROPOLIS

 In 1965, social scientist Nirmal 

 Bose described Calcutta as a premature metropolis, a city 

 struggling to combine the ethos of a pre-agrarian society 

 with that of an industralized economy. That ethical disjunction 

 is still alive more than four decades later, in the way 

 different classes of Calcuttans engage with social justice. 

 Two recent incidents in the city made me think of Boses 

 phrase and the limitations in the image of Calcutta as the 

 kindest, most benevolent and caring among Indian metropolises. 

 The week before last, Tina Mukherjee, a model, and her friend were attacked by a couple of drunken men at a busy crossing. As they cried out for help, Calcuttans around them stood watching. Perhaps because the incident took place in Calcutta a city known to possess a conscience it created a considerable stir. So, is the reputation of Calcutta being a humane city just a myth? Or have Calcuttans become progressively desensitized to violence in the public sphere?

 The answers are anything but evident, Calcutta being a city of contradictions. A few days before Tina Mukherjees harassment, in Chetla, a mob, consisting mainly of women, had lynched Dom Pradip, a notorious extortionist, who had returned to the area after spending six years in jail. In the heyday of Pradips career, when he went about plundering businessmen, raping local women and murdering innocents, the police had routinely failed to do anything to stop his misrule. So dreading his return, the locals got together to ensure justice that has been delayed and denied them so long. Legal considerations had to be overridden by public interest; people stood by each other in a memorable show of solidarity.

 So, its not as if the city doesnt come together in times of trouble. Of course, there was a difference between the Chetla incident and Tina Mukherjees experience. At the heart of the first was a public interest cause. It was the pro bono publico aspect of the murder of Pradip that justified the action of the women who killed him. Faced with an individual in distress, people clearly lack the courage of conviction to protest. Of course, there is the very real danger of putting your life at risk for the sake of protecting someone elses dignity. Very often, this fear of getting physically harmed delays, or even impedes, public reaction.

 The other factor, of course, is class. Middle-class sensibility prefers the ready and the easy way of escape to confronting injustice, laced as it is with danger. The women of Chetla were from the poorest sections of society, which is why they did not hesitate to resort to such an extreme form of collective action in order to safeguard the fundamentals of their lives. As it is, only women, across various classes, and those with little claims to social and legal justice, have the courage to stand up to injustice. The rest are either selectively blind or afraid, and that leaves Calcutta as only a premature metropolis.

 TAKE A CAB INSTEAD

 Does Calcutta care? Even a decade 

 back, the question was redundant. From former governors 

 of West Bengal and sometime residents to lay visitors, many 

 Indians swore by the warmth and goodwill of Calcuttans. 

 Today, the question prompts an introspection of sorts in 

 this city of an elusive joy. 

 Take the millions who commute by that epitome in our memories of underdevelopment the Calcutta private bus. That a fundamental callousness and a defeatism characterize the Calcuttan today is nowhere more evident. Whether the Calcuttans gripes on a bus find a voice or not and whether he lends a voice to someone elses depend on his mood and energy levels at the beginning or the end of each of his self-same days. Perhaps his historic discontent has finally turned into hopelessness or made way for mere self-interest.

 Of course, concern and helpfulness persist. But the city is undergoing a psychological transmogrification under new economic and demographic imperatives. Hence the merely sporadic protests when women are regularly molested or harassed on city buses. One could also thus account for one half of the passengers remaining silent with the other shouting itself hoarse, urging the driver to pull faster or slower, depending on whether the bus is dragging in order to pick up that one extra passenger or whether it is madly racing with a route-brother. 

 Many commuters still protest when they see a woman being deliberately given a tough time. But it is a matter of no small import that many others sit silent while a few also remark, Bhir bus-e uthhechhen jokhon tokhon erokomi hobeoto ashubidha hole taxi-te jaben. A city that has spent the greater part of its life after independence protesting against everything under the sun appears, at times, to have lost its sense of right and wrong. 

 Calcutta buses are not kind to the old and the disabled either. Passengers who usually occupy seats meant for the disabled often need to be prodded into giving them up on the rare occasions when the handicapped do get on board. As for the bus conductors who would rather drag all pedestrians onto their buses one evening last month a man on crutches tried to board the minibus I was on at the Mayo Road intersection. At the sound of the conductors irritated voice, I turned to see him raise his leg to prevent the poor fellow from getting on the footboard. His final retort was a sharp Hobe na bolchhi tai hobe na as the bus sped off.

 Masking murder

 Sir The Gujarat governments failure to detect the fake encounters that caused the deaths of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife, Kauser Bi, is deplorable (Gujarats burning secret out, May 1). In fact, the government rewarded the guilty policemen with promotions. However, it should be remembered that most states in India have witnessed encounter killings staged by the police. Therefore, it would be better to carefully examine the list of encounters killings all over India to find out how many innocent lives have been lost in this manner. The Gujarat tragedy proves the failure of the federal set-up in India since the Centre should have detected what was going on in the state a long time ago. Leaving every crime in the country to a pro-active judiciary is proof of poor governance. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir Fake-encounter killings increase when the police force in a state gets politicized. As a result of such politicization, policemen come to believe that they can get away with murder. Fake encounters also allow the police to avoid the tedious process of having to prove the charges against the accused in a court of law. After justice is delivered on the Gujarat killings, India should ensure checks and balances in every government department to prevent them from acquiring undue power. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The anti-terrorist squads of three states would target one man only if he were a notorious criminal or if they had been paid to get rid of him. Perhaps, the accused, D.J. Vanzara, pocketed the proceeds from killing Sohrabuddin and shared the booty with his ATS buddies from the two other states. Then he must have gone on to concoct the story of encounters after branding Sheikh as a hard-core terrorist. The victim, according to Vanzara, had come to Gujarat to kill Modi.Vanzara has had other fake-encounter killings to his name. But the shrewd man usually chose a Muslim (except on one occasion) with a criminal background as a target in a state where the government has been notorious in its treatment of the minority community. It is in Narendra Modis interests to punish the man who is guilty of sullying the chief ministers reputation. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Gujarat police could kill Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife, Kausar Bi, because there is no law that would have ensured a mandatory second investigation by the Central agencies in the case of each and every encounter and custodial death. Even the investigations by the National Human Rights Commission into such incidents lack teeth since the NHRC is devoid of statutory penal powers. The Centre should make a second investigation mandatory, thereby emulating the practice which is in place in many developed countries in such matters. A scrutiny by a Central agency, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, may help in winning the confidence of the people as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Since the perpetrators of the crime in Gujarat were all law-enforcement officers, the only plausible reason for their criminal indulgence is the absence of any fear of retribution. If Narendra Modis government is involved in this case, and has tried to protect the killers, it is because of the lack of supervision from the Centre. The Central government seems to have abdicated its constitutional responsibility of protecting citizens and of monitoring the administrative functioning of different states.

 Yours faithfully,

Sachin Kurmi, Ghaziabad

 Sir The encounter killings in Gujarat are getting wide publicity owing to the fact that the Bharatiya Janata Party is in power in that state. However, the party should welcome a CBI probe in Gujarat as such a step would enable it to make similar investigations in other states that have also witnessed encounter killings. Perhaps, the only way to stop such murders is by ensuring that the police remain independent of political influence.

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir It is ironical that the Centre has finally asked for a CBI enquiry into the killings of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife. For so long, the Congress-led coalition government did not find it necessary to investigate the over two-dozen encounters that have taken place in Gujarat. One wonders whether the elections in Uttar Pradesh caused a sudden change in the Centres stand. If it is so, then it has to be said that political considerations, rather than peoples right to a safe life, always shape the governments actions in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.A. Mohideen, Chennai

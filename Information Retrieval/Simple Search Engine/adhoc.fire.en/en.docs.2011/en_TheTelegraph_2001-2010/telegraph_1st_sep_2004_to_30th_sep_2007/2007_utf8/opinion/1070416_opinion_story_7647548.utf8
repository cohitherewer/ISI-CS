 It is natural that Indian bosoms should swell with pride as Indias foreign exchange reserves cross $200 billion. All adults remember the queues at petrol pumps in early 1991: the prime minister, Mr Chandra Shekhar, had mismanaged the economy so badly that he did not have the money to pay for oil imports. There was so little foreign exchange that factories were closing down and industrial production was falling. Inflation was running at 14 per cent. By the standards set by Mr Chandra Shekhar, the present prime minister must appear a genius. Far from falling, industrial production is growing at 11 per cent per annum. Not only have the reserves been boosted to $200 billion, but inflation too has been brought down. Admittedly, it is still higher than what we have got used to in the last ten years, but it is less than half of Mr Chandra Shekhars rate. It was heartwarming to see the finance minister twist the arms of steel-makers and cement-producers to bring down their prices. Farmers in Punjab may complain about the Rs 850 a quintal they are paid for wheat when market prices are twice as high; but someone has to make sacrifices for the nation, and who better than the farmers? Nowadays, they have become too rich. They even have money to hoard wheat. The government can teach them a lesson by importing wheat, which is cheaper as long as the government does not charge duty on it: and it always recuses itself from paying import duty. In any case, the duty would be money going from one pocket of the government to another. 

 Some may say that the bulging reserves are a sign of too low imports, not too high. The balance of trade gives them the lie: the trade deficit, which was $40.1 billion in April-December 2005, shot up to $52.3 billion in 2006. If reserves continue to skyrocket nevertheless, it is because of the worlds confidence in India: in the same nine months, its investment in India more than doubled from $13.8 billion to $28 billion. But that is a rise of only $14.2 billion; reserves went up by $29.9 billion in the same period. Where did the rest of the money come from? From sheer official ingenuity: the Reserve Bank of India raised the dollar value of its foreign exchange reserves by that much. It called the rise valuation changes. If it were a bit more energetic about such changes, there would be a trillion dollars of reserves before the crowing had stopped about the $200 billion. Meanwhile, the government ought to use those billions to import food. It should end its own monopoly of foodgrain import and let everyone import them, so that domestic prices have no chance of rising if cheaper imports are available. And it should let everyones imports in, free of duty, not just its own.

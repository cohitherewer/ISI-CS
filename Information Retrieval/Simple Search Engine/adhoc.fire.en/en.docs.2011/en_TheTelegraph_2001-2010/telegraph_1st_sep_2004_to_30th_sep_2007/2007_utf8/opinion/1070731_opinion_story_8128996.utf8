 GREY AREAS

 Big causes often have small and unfortunate victims. The sufferings that Mohammed Haneef had to undergo because he was suspected of being a terrorist will not be wiped off his memory merely by the fact of his release and the admission of error by the Australian government. His predicament and suffering carry the marks of a very serious social malaise that afflicts the modern State. The states of many countries have now been made easy targets of terrorist attacks. Terrorist organizations do not hesitate to pit the life of an individual or the lives of a group of individuals against the might of the modern State. The battle is apparently unequal, what with the military might of the State on one side and the wits of a brainwashed individual on the other. Terrorism has aptly been described as asymmetrical warfare. This type of warfare obviously does not create too many dilemmas for a totalitarian regime since the latter does not recognize the rule of law. A totalitarian regime can thus use its repressive apparatus without any qualms. But for a liberal-democratic State, the problems posed by terrorism are enormous.

 A liberal-democratic State is premised on the rule of law and on the rights of individuals. In fact, the State has to guarantee the liberty of the individual as well as his safety. What happens, though, when one individual exercises his liberty to kill many or to endanger their lives? In a democracy, every individual has the right to show dissent and terrorism takes advantage of this right. The liberal State in such conditions is forced to protect the lives and properties of the many against the violence of one individual or group of individuals. The liberal State can do this only by being more repressive than its theorists would like it to be. There is no point in bleeding ones heart over this, since the alternative is to risk the lives of many. By definition, anti-terrorist laws and measures are stringent, some might even say oppressive. When those laws and measures are executed, often innocent people are harassed, arrested and even killed. The laws even allow prejudices to surface and influence decision-making. This is the most unfortunate part of the global attempts to curb terrorism. Mr Haneef is a living victim of the process which may at times be unfair, but is without an alternative, at least within the framework of the liberal-democratic State.

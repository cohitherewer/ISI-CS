 FROM WAR TO WAR

 Nothing seems to have changed for Somalia, used to not having a proper government for about 16 years now. The incessant civil wars since Somalias dictator, General Mohamed Siad Barre, was overthrown, seem to have turned now, into the African chapter of President Bushs War on Terror. And the martial law, declared by the interim government for three months, keeps it going in the same vein for this ravaged little nation in the Horn of Africa. Paradoxically, for ordinary Somalians, the only period of relative peace and stability were those six months when the Islamists had taken over from the warlords and ruled from Mogadishu. Their Union of Islamic Courts set up initially by local businessmen to sort out their law-and-order problems is now divided between moderates and hardliners, the latter embodying some of the repressive excesses of the Sharia law. But moderate Somalian Muslims dislike its extreme puritanism and parochialism, in spite of its efforts to win recognition from the United Nations, the European Union and the United States of America.

 That favour is now beyond its hopes since the US has decided that these are Islamists who are harbouring al Qaida terrorists. The UIC has denied this, but the rage of the US has already sought out its targets through air raids in southern Somalia. So, east Africa is on the map of terror with west Asia. Somalias northern neighbour, Ethiopia, which has been helping with troops for a while because of its dislike of the Islamists, finds itself identified with the Americans as occupiers in Somalia. Its other neighbour, Eritrea, on the other hand, is allegedly funding the Islamists. The question is, what will happen now? The Ethiopians, who have helped set up the interim government, are generally resented, and will have to clear out as soon as they can. But a country battening on anarchy for years is hardly in a position to maintain its own peace in the absence of externally marshalled troops. So the UN would have to get together a peace-keeping force to help the prime minister, Mr Ali Mohamad Ghedi, carry out his plans for restoration. But is this the end of war, or the beginning of another kind of guerrilla warfare carried on by the smoked-out Islamists? And to what extent will the quelled warlords, with their own history of conflicting ambitions, remain subdued in the absence of neighbourly, and American, intervention?

 Letters to Editor

 Too many words

 Sir Stephen Hugh-Jones is right. Despite the campaign for simplifying the English language, unnecessary verbosity persists (Short is best, Sept 5). For instance, the application form for a driving licence issued by the Regional Transport Authority in Calcutta reads: Are you able to distinguish with each eye [or if you have a licence to drive a motor vehicle for a period of not less than five years and if you have lost sight of one eye after the said period of five years and if the application is for driving a light motor vehicle fitted with an outside mirror on the steering wheel side, with one eye], at a distance of 25 metres in good day light [with glasses, if worn], a motor car number plate containing seven letters and figures?

 Yours faithfully,

 Asoke C. Banerjee,

 Extreme measures

 Sir It is a sad commentary on our economy that a couple has had to sell off their child because they could not afford its upkeep (Three too many to feed, Sept 3). This goes to show that family planning has failed in India. The trend of population growth in the economically backward sections of our society corroborates this fact. Extreme poverty forced Tamluks Raju Singh to sell his 21-day-old son to a couple for just Rs 10,000. Raju will be lucky if the child finds a good home. In several cases, children given up for adoption to unreliable sources are trafficked overseas. Panchayats must conduct door-to-door campaigns about family planning and the efficacy of birth control. Contraceptives should be made readily available. Development will remain a distant dream unless population is controlled.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, 

 Burdwan

 Sir It is shameful that our lopsided economic policies cannot protect either the health or the welfare of our children. While poverty leads one father in Tamluk to sell his son, another in Midnapore contemplates selling a kidney and an eye to pay for his sons medical expenses. While some earn salaries in lakhs, others die of starvation, that too in a state that takes pride in its socialist ideals. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta,

 Animal love

 Sir I enjoyed reading about the latest escapade by an elephant (Tusker on the run with love, Sept 5). One tends to get jaded by the depressing news that cover the front pages of newspapers these days. The news about the pachyderm elopement was a refreshing change. While I feel pleased that Sabitri, a female elephant, has enjoyed her romp, I also feel sorry for the other females who were left behind in the circus. There are reports about these love-lorn ladies moping and fretting and going off food. Although I am no expert on elephants, I believe that these animals too should be allowed to move around a bit. The consequences of not allowing them freedom once in a while may not be desirable. 

 On the one hand, there is a very real possibility that they may get seriously malnourished. On the other, it is equally probable that they may turn violent. Implementing this suggestion could pose a lot of problems for forest officers and those running the circus. But I am sure these men are well capable of handling such situations without unnecessarily jeopardizing the lives of the animals and the humans who might come in their way. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kamalini Mazumder, 

 Calcutta

 Erratum

 In Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article, Ancient Indian logic (Sept 8), Arthur Hassall has been wrongly called a Cambridge historian. Hassall was, in fact, a tutor at Christ Church College, Oxford. The error is regretted.

 Sir Amartya Sens views on land-acquisition for industries has rekindled the debate on the subject (Prohibiting the use of agricultural land for industries is ultimately self-defeating, July 23). Admittedly, land is required for industries, and industries generate employment. However, Sen seems to have ignored the fact that land was acquired in Singur and elsewhere at gunpoint, and not by fair means. The right to property is a fundamental right; therefore, unwilling landowners should not be coerced to part with their land. Moreover, it is not as if nearness to a big city is essential for industrial development. Sen should know that many industries from Mumbai and Delhi have shifted to neighbouring areas to lessen pollution in the big cities. And cultivation is impossible on barren land, while industries can be set up on any kind of land reason enough to oppose the governments move to turn arable land into SEZs.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir One hopes that Amartya Sens wise counsel would end the debate on industrialization. The problem of land acquisition in India emerges from the lack of any uniform policy or law on land use across the country. Which is why investors get different treatment from different states when they wish to set up industries. It is true that the people of Bengal would be losing a great deal if they antagonize potential industrialists. However, the government should emphasize industrialization of remote areas, particularly backward districts with vast barren lands rather than agriculturally rich areas such as Singur. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Calcutta

 Sir Amartya Sens interview left me with a couple of questions. It is true, as Sen points out, that indigo trade flourished during the time of the East India Company in Bengal. But was there anything glorious about the torture that was unleashed upon farmers unwilling to cultivate indigo? Does Sen think that the present votaries of capitalism in West Bengal have initiated aggressive industrialization with an enlightened sense of the past?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Amartya Sen has pointed out that fertile land was used for industries in Manchester with great success. True as this might be, he has ignored the man-land ratio or the rate of population growth in these places. He seems to have little idea about the sordid living conditions in rural West Bengal. Mohammed Yunus, also a Nobel laureate, who has worked with the poor all his life, would have a clearer perception of poverty than the Harvard economist. The Left Front government is persisting on building a chemical hub in Haldia but has no plans of reviving the existing chemical industries around Rishra. Since the establishment of Hindustan Motors and Dunlop, the project of modernization has fallen through owing to vicious trade unionism in the factories. Sen is hopeful that the establishment of industries would arrest migration of poor people to other states. Has he any idea of the huge number of unskilled labourers who have to be employed if their lands are taken away? In practical terms, why would industries employ these untrained people, and in any event, how many would eventually manage to get employed? Drawing parallels with Italy or Pittsburgh would be of little help to the farmers of Singur and Nandigram. What Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has attempted in the name of industrialization is damage control after the state was ruined by the Left Fronts thirty-year rule. Ironically, he is causing more damage than he is undoing. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir Amartya Sen has wisely pointed out that the government has not explored the possibility of maximizing the price of fertile agricultural land. The government rate has remained far below the competitive rate offered by the industries. This has led to the mixing of economic and political issues, to the disadvantage of both the government and the farmers. Both the ruling party and the Opposition should heed Sens advice and stop indulging in self-defeating activities.

 Yours faithfully, 

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir As a professional working on rural development in West Bengal for several years, and a former student of economic history, I was shocked to read Amartya Sens interview. Sen seems to have given a rather simplistic interpretation of a very complex and crucial situation. In his recounting of the history of Bengals flourishing trade and commerce, the concept of colonialism and colonial capital has been totally left out. In England, the Industrial Revolution led to jobs for the British as free flow of labour was not possible at that time. However, it cannot be concluded that a similar industrial revolution in Bengal would result in jobs for the poor and unskilled villagers. If anything, it is likely to attract skilled workers from all over India. Sen has also endorsed the nearness to Calcutta as an important factor for industrial development. Being one of the greatest theorists of poverty, he surely knows that this is likely to increase the gulf between the urban and rural sectors. Small industries in the state are in a terrible condition. They need to be revived before more ambitious plans are executed. Amul, for instance, is more likely to generate income for the poor than Tata. Industrialization is important, but more important is to complete the modernization of agriculture. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debraj Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir Amartya Sen is perhaps not aware of the real picture of Indian farmers, which is why he can compare them so easily with their Western counterparts. In most of the West, cultivation is a largely mechanized process, unlike in India. Indian farmers depend heavily on rains, while those in the West have advanced irrigation facilities. In America, farmers are well-protected by the government, which is why they are not forced to commit suicide for crop failure or inability to repay loans. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir Were industries in Manchester or Lancashire ever reduced to the state of negligence that those in gangetic West Bengal have been over the last 40 years? Does Amartya Sen know about the thousands who have lost their livelihood to these failed industries? Maybe not, or he would have been more severe on the governments latest drive for industrialization. 

 Yours faithfully,

Basudeb Moulick, Calcutta

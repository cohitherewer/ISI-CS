 Follow the rules 

 China Diary -Neha Sahay

 Another week-long national holiday began on Tuesday the Labour Day holidays. Once more, the country shut down to rest, travel, make merry and spend. After it is over, the papers will gleefully publish how much was spent. Thats the raison dtre of these Golden Weeks to generate consumption and boost the economy.

 Just before the celebrations began, the central government came out with new guidelines for its officials which would surely dampen the holiday spirit. However, it thoughtfully laid down June 1 as the date from which these regulations will be effective. So officials can have one last orgy this week.

 China has an estimated 6.5 million civil servants, all of whom must be members of the communist party. Maos Red Book had extensive guidelines for communists, some almost impossible to follow. His exhortations against liberalism, for example, made it mandatory for a true communist never to overlook the failings even of close friends. 

 The current government has no time for all this. Its solutions, aimed at persuading officials to adopt a clean, honest and down-to-earth work style to better serve the people, are routine, but its list of lapses makes for interesting reading.

 Arrogance, looking away while wrong ideas are spread, reluctance to explain things to the people, being ahead of or lagging behind the masses all these were considered serious failings by Mao. Today, these are history. Now, having a mistress, using influence to benefit a lover, organizing superstitious gatherings, using drugs, gambling and engaging in the sex-trade can get officials the sack.

 Little effect

 Theres more not what would ordinarily pass off as criminal acts, but serious derelictions from a Confucian point of view. Incidentally, the ancient philosopher, discredited during Maos time, is now making a huge comeback. Just how important his value system is considered can be seen from these regulations: government officials who abuse or abandon family members or refuse to support their elderly relations can also be fired.

 Surprisingly, other acts which would normally be looked upon very seriously indeed, may count only for a grave demerit, or may result in sacking. These include leaving the country without permission, staying overseas longer than permitted and secretly obtaining foreign citizenship. Apart from personal corruption, the regulations stipulate acts that can harm society. 

 The real aim of these regulations can be gauged from the remark made by a minister to the media: these rules are important for consolidating the Communist Partys ruling position and safeguarding state power. Hence, acts leading to mass protests have also been included. That explains the inclusion of acts such as embezzlement or loss of public funds meant for disaster or poverty relief, resident resettlement, social security and land appropriation compensation.

 Public employees who physically abuse and illegally detain citizens will also be punished, the regulations say. So also those who repress criticism or retaliate against whistle-blowers. The last regulation is rich, because the central government has been less than generous with the man who went public with the SARS outbreak, and the blind lawyer who took up cases of women forced into abortions, to name just two.

 Will all this make officials more conscientious? Everyday, the official media carries reports about suspensions, demotions, sackings and even executions of civil servants for corruption and criminal laxity. But few among the people are convinced. The big fish get away, they say, and those that get convicted, manage to flee the country before serving their entire sentence.

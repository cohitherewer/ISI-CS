 TEN COMMANDMENTS

 This prime minister is fond of homilies; but perhaps none of his dozen-odd addresses to the captains of industry hitherto has been so carping, hectoring and gruelling as his address to the Confederation of Indian Industry last week. Why did he choose this tone, so inappropriate for what was essentially a harmless celebration? It has been alleged that Manmohan Singh was concerned about the attacks from the demoted and disaffected Mani Shankar Aiyar, and sought in this speech to buttress his left bastion. Political manoeuvring is not foreign to him. But to write off this speech would be to attribute more calculation and opportunism to him than he deserves. Reading between the lines for instance, from the repetition of his favourite slogans and clichs it is clear that this speech came straight from the prime ministers heart, and for that reason must be taken seriously.

 A closer look at the prime ministers admonitions shows that in virtually all the areas where he asked industry to take initiative, the government has acknowledged duties and longstanding legislation or programmes. Whether it is workers welfare, uplift of the backward, employment, training, action against monopolies, environment, enterprise, innovation, prevention of corruption, or disciplining of the media, the government has a long acknowledged role. So when the prime minister urged industry to take the lead in these areas, its implications were ambiguous: did he want it to take on functions that have traditionally been the governments, was he thinking of a wider private-public partnership, was he accusing industry of failing to cooperate, or was he just letting off his prejudices against private industry?

 A peeved industrialist would also want to ask the prime minister just how effective his government has been in these areas. How well has it used its enormous expenditure financed at least partly by taxation of industry and how much of it has the government wasted? He would also want to say: give us the money you spend on education, health and assistance of selected castes, and we would show you how far it can be made to go. If the enormous resources the government has spent on these worthy objectives since independence had been used purposefully and efficiently, we would already have gone a long way in addressing the needs and concerns of all sections of our society, especially the poorest among us. But if poverty had been abolished, politicians and their protgs would have been much poorer.

 The prime ministers admonitions are all appropriate, and no one can dispute his right to deliver them. But they would have been taken more seriously if he had used his high post to reform the government in the directions in which he is urging industry to tra- vel. Unless he improves the government he is in charge of in the short time left to him, further sermons from him will evoke only disdain, and not just from industrialists.

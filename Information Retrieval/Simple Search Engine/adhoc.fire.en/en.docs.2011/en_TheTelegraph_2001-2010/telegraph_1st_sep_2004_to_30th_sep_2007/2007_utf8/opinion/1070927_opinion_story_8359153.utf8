 Sealed justice

 Sir The sealing drive in Delhi, once advocated so relentlessly by Y.K. Sabharwal while he was the chief justice of the Supreme Court, was supposed to be in the interest of the public. However, the excellent investigations by reporters of Mid Day have revealed a distinctly personal interest behind Sabharwals actions (Journalists get jail and bail, Sept 22). The former chief justice went so far as to question the wisdom of the legislature, which had passed an ordinance granting a years time for the shifting of the small businesses from certain areas of the city, which would be turned into multiplexes and malls. The nation is indebted to the fearless journalists who chose to expose the narrow self-interest of Sabharwal. It is a pity that their valiant efforts might get them imprisoned and fined.

 Yours faithfully,

Kattari Ananda Naidu, Chennai

 Sir It is true that the journalists of Mid Day are guilty of contempt of court after insinuating that the former chief justice, Y.K. Sabharwal, had personal designs when he ordered the sealing drive around Delhi. However, now that the can of worms has been opened by challenging the law or otherwise would there be any proper inquiry into Sabharwals involvement in the matter, as alleged? Apart from the charges of corruption, it must be admitted that the demolition drive ordered by Sabharwal small industrial units were uprooted and replaced by huge shopping malls lacked the slightest trace of humanity. It is now being suspected that his sons might have had a stake in the building of the malls and therefore, in the demolitions. Unless this suspicion is proved untrue, this incident would continue to make the people of India question the degree of impartiality of the judiciary. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sheriff Ashik Mohideen, Chennai

 Sir A few months back, it had been suggested that the judiciary be reviewed by an independent committee, and not allowed to remain above the strictures of the Rule of Law. Since this was found to be unacceptable, and by none other than the judiciary itself, there is now such a great controversy around Justice Sabharwals verdict on the Delhi sealing drive. The confusion is understandable, there being no arbiter overseeing the course of justice in this case. The journalists from Mid Day could only add fuel to the fire of discontent in the minds of all those small businessmen who have been hastily and cruelly removed from parts of Delhi to make way for wealthier and more ambitious projects. Admittedly, contempt of court is a sensitive issue. However, in a democracy, people must be allowed to at least raise questions about, if not directly criticize, possible corruption in the judiciary.

 Yours faithfully,

 Idol worship

 Sir Prashant Tamang may have been crowned the Indian Idol, but there was no doubt that his rivals, Emon Chatterjee and Amit Paul, were equally brilliant singers (All night frenzy, Sept 25). However, Tamangs victory was predictable. His entry into the final round, by ousting the immensely talented Emon, showed that much was being done to win the hearts of the hill people just as Amit, a finalist too, had to bury his Bengali antecedents and become an icon of Meghalaya. The most revealing aspect of the Indian Idol show was the role regional sentiments played in the making of a national icon, pushing aside more important questions of talent and charisma.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir With due respect to all communities, it must be conceded that a show like Indian Idol has been responsible for inciting divisive feelings among people from various parts of the country. On the eve of the final between Amit Paul and Prashant Tamang, the two hill towns, Shillong and Darjeeling, were almost on the verge of a battle. Instead of provoking such extreme hostility, would it not have been better if the voting were not left to the public but the outcome decided by the judges alone? After all, the very existence of the voting option called out for regional sentiments to be stirred. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ankita Chakrovarty and Anita Tamang, Darjeeling

 Sir The crowning of Prashant Tamang as the new Indian Idol shows once more that when public voting is used to select professional singers, the choice is mostly wrong. In this edition of the contest, Amit Paul was a far better singer than Prashant who won only by the massive public voting by the Nepali/ Gorkha community. In fact, singers far more talented than Tamang lost out to him in the earlier rounds again because of the mass voting. There needs to be a rethink about the use of public voting to find the winner in contests of this kind. It also cannot be mere coincidence that girls are always voted out early Indians are largely biased against women. There should be separate titles for boys and girls, and the final winner must be chosen by a panel of experts.

 Yours faithfully, 

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir Prashant Tamangs win has raised serious doubts regarding the basic purpose of talent-hunt shows in India. Tamang is Darjeelings choice, not Indias. The people of Darjeeling, along with a large chunk of the Nepalese population and a section of the Calcutta police, have voted blindly and indiscriminately in his favour. Can the producers or judges of Indian Idol put their hands on their hearts and say that they have really discovered an outstanding talent through the show? However, the high TRPs generated by the show will make them wish away such uncomfortable questions. But the one question that needs to be asked today is: are talent-hunt shows on Indian television primarily for the benefit of TV channels and mobile companies or do they really mean to discover and promote genuine talent? If it is the latter, then the brains behind such shows should devise ways to restrict the tsunami of unethical audience voting. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Kisholoy Roy, Calcutta

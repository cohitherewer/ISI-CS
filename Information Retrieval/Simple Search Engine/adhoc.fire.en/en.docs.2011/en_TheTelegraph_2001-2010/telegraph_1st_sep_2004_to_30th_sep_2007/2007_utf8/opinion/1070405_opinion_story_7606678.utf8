 WINDS OF CHANGE

 The Indian cricket world is poised to explode. This is not because the senior Indian cricketers are threatening to for Greg Chappells jugular but because for the first time in its history, the monopoly of the Board of Control for Cricket in India is in danger of being broken. Mr Subhas Chandra, owner of Zee television, has announced that he will launch a cricket league by the end of 2007. Mr Chandra is following a very successful model: Kerry Packer, another television magnate, had broken the monopoly of the Australian Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council in the Seventies. Mr Chandras venture might appear to some people as the end of Indian cricket as they have known it, but once they abandon their prejudices, they will realize that Mr Chandras move can only benefit Indian cricket and cricketers. The benefits will come because an Indian cricket league outside the aegis of the BCCI will usher in greater competition and thus open up the world of Indian cricket. Indian cricketers will have greater opportunities and the cricket fans of the country will have greater variety. One has only to recall the impact that Packer had on international cricket and Jack Kramer had on tennis to realize the full impact of the benefits that can accrue.

 International cricketers today, including Indian ones, are no longer amateurs. They are professionals. In other words, like professionals in other spheres, they should be allowed to be mobile and be able to offer their services in a manner that maximizes their own interest. It should be a matter of individual choice based on the individuals assessment of his own skills, the opportunities available and his own sense of dignity. It is only certain preconceived notions and prejudices that produce the expectation that a cricketer born in India should only play for India or the idea that all Indian cricketers should be affiliated to the BCCI. If the BCCI sees itself as an employer of the cricketers and in a sense it is, since it ties down cricketers with contracts and so on it should be prepared to meet challenges from other potential employers. This happens on a regular basis in other professional fields. The BCCI cannot see itself as being sacrosanct, and loyalty to it cannot be a surrogate for patriotism. Mr Chandra may have his own business interests in promoting an cricket league but in the process he may free Indian cricket.

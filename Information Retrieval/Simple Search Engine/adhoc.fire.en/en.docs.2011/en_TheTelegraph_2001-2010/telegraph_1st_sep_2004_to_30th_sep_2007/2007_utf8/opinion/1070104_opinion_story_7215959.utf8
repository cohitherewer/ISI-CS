The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 KEEP TALKING

 The opposition is an indispensable presence for the successful functioning of a democracy. Governance in a democracy proceeds from difference and opposition to agreement and consensus. The process is invariably informed by discussion and debate. In an ideal situation, the differences and the debate are both articulated on the basis of certain principles or ideology. But the functioning of democracy in India is far away from the ideal situation. The opposition to a policy announced by a government does not follow from any principles. A very good example of this is the entire debate on economic reforms. The Bharatiya Janata Party, when it was in opposition in the Nineties, was a stern critic of economic reforms and liberalization. It opposed the privatization of sectors like insurance. But when it assumed office, it pushed forward economic reforms and policies, which it had opposed before it had come to power. The National Democratic Alliance government took some of the first steps to bring India and the United States of America closer. It is not unreasonable to suggest that if it had continued in power, the NDA would have also worked to establish the current Indo-US nuclear deal. But today, because it is in opposition, the BJP is vocal in its criticism of the deal. However, the BJP is by no means the only political party to behave in this kind of unprincipled manner. The first and immediate victim of such behaviour is debate, since no debate is possible unless it is based on certain consistent ideological principles.

 The other victim is the second critical aspect of democratic governance the attempt to build a consensus on any given issue. Mr Manmohan Singh, perhaps because he is a man of principles, was so appalled by the absence of principles all around him that he despaired of building a consensus on policies of national importance. This was certainly not the best reaction on his part. He is trying to make amends, if the lunch he gave for the BJP leaders on Monday is an indication. In a democracy there is only the trying. However adverse the situation and however discordant the opposition, discussion should not be abandoned. The opposition in a democracy must be taken seriously, even if it does not take itself seriously.

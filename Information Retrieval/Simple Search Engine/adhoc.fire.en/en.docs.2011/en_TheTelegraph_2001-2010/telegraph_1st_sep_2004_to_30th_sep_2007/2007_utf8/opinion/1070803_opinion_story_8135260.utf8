 BIG IS NOT ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL

 Bookwise 

 Tyranny of length 

 Anton Chekhov, the famous short-story writer, often lamented that he had a mania for shortness: Whatever I read my own or other peoples works it all seems to me not short enough. So, in his memory, an international competition for the greatest short story was organized some years ago and the prize went to a one-line story by Augusto Monterroso, a Guatemalan writer: When I woke up, the dinosaur was still there. It says so much about the harsh realities of central America in so little! You are reminded of this when you see some books that would have been twice as good at half their size. How can we get some respite from this tyranny of length? But, first, why does it happen at all? 

 Because we have an oral and not a written tradition, we make no distinction between speaking and writing; we write as loosely as most of us speak and, therefore, end up writing too much.

 No one really wants to read more than is required. Worse, our attention-span gets shorter and shorter as it is targetted, to use the latest lingo, by powerful forces television, the entertainment industry and so on. So we need to make our copy tighter, even if it means having to leave out matter that a writer may feel is essential to the main body of the argument. 

 But all this has been said ad nauseam. Yet we find general books written for the common reader running into 300-plus pages, when at least 50 pages could have been safely lopped off without any damage to the book; in fact, it would have been twice as good: the books would have been cheaper and more accessible. 

 There are two reasons for this looseness of approach. First, there is a lack of in-house editorial expertise. Editing requires sensitivity to language and style, as well as to the subject matter. Taste, literary discrimination and a grand passion for the work undertaken is not something that can be taught; it has to come from within. Since this is not easy to come by, what editing amounts to today is fact-checking and making the typescript consistent in relation to spellings, dates and other details. Sadly, another pernicious idea has taken root in recent years: all editorial flaws can be covered up if the packaging is good. That is, if the design and the layout are attractive and sufficient colour is thrown in, all would be forgiven. Of course, these are important factors but they cannot replace editorial tightness. 

 Authors, with a few exceptions, do not take editorial changes gladly. They believe that they know best about how much to put in without realizing that the game is not just about publishing the book but selling it as well. The bigger the book, the higher the price, which makes it more difficult to sell. Small, in that sense, is beautiful.

 Letters to Editor

 An affair not to remember

 Sir Tony Blair does not have to croon, in the manner of Eva Peron, Dont cry for me, Britain, because it is unlikely that the British will miss him. Except for some degree of prosperity during his regime, which many, with good reason, attribute to Gordon Browns clever management of the economy, Blairs premiership will be remembered for the illegal war in Iraq that caused suffering to millions, the rumours about his government selling baronetcy for money, the manipulation of the press and the endless stories of corruption.

 Yours faithfully,

 Family business

 Out of business

 Sir Dayanidhi Maran, starting 

 from his attire to his way of functioning, was obviously 

 not in tune with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams traditional 

 ideology and culture. He shunned his partymens practice 

 of wearing a dhoti with the partys black-and-red 

 border. Maran brought in a modern and business-like outlook 

 to Tamil politics. If M. Karunanidhi dips into his current 

 reserve of MPs, he will find it hard to get a replacement 

 for Maran whom he has unjustly recalled from New Delhi (DMK 

 disconnects Daya from Delhi, May 14). 

 Yours faithfully, 

 J. Akshay, 

 Secunderabad

 Sir It is unfortunate that the 

 worlds largest democracy is run like a family business. 

 Dayanidhi Maran is the latest victim of family politics. 

 His penchant for innovation gave India perfumed postal stamps. 

 The United Progressive Alliance chairperson, Sonia Gandhi, 

 should take personal initiative to make the Indian democracy 

 prioritize quality over favouritism. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Madhu Agrawal, 

 Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Dayanidhi Maran, one of 

 the most qualified, dynamic and upright ministers in the 

 UPA cabinet, had to resign to cater to the whims of his 

 party boss. His departure is sure to slow down the progress 

 of the telecom department. After the frayed temper of the 

 DMK patriarch, M. Karunanidhi, cools down, the prime minister, 

 Manmohan Singh, ought to request him, in the interest of 

 the country, to permit Maran to get back to his ministry. 

 After all, the recall and resignation drama originates in 

 the DMK bosss belief that Maran had something to do with 

 the Dinakaran fire of which there is no proof.

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 Calcutta

 Sir M. Karunanidhi may not want to wash dirty family linen in public. But he owes an explanation on why he chose to recall Dayanidhi Maran from Delhi, while going out of his way to protect his eldest son, M. K. Azhagiri, whose supporters engineered the attack on the Madurai office of the Dinakaran newspaper, owned by Kalanidhi Maran. We have seen family feuds and intrigues elsewhere too in the Shiv Sena for instance. And craven submission by loyalists to the supremacy of the dynasty as in the Congress is something we have to live with till our political parties evolve into truly democratic institutions.

 Yours faithfully, 

 J. Akshobhya, 

 Mysore

 Sir Although Dayanidhi Maran has collected a lot of public sympathy in the wake of his resignation-under-compulsion, he is no babe in the woods. He wouldnt be in the sordid game of Tamil politics with his professional qualifications if he were a simple man. Also, how can the minister who frames the governments satellite and cable policies have stakes in a cable television channel, Sun TV?

 Yours faithfully, 

 G.S. Hemant, 

 Calcutta

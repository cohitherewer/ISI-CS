 THE WOMAN QUESTION

 Mother fixation

 Specters of Mother India: 

 The Global Restructuring of an Empire By Mrinalini 

 Sinha,

 Rs 395

 The iconic image of the nation as a mother goddess was 

 used to garner patriotic sentiments as the Indian nationalist 

 struggle gained impetus. In order to inspire the people 

 of the nascent Indian State to fight for its freedom, it 

 was imperative that the nation be identified not merely 

 with a woman, but with the woman as mother. Her unproblematic 

 identity, defined by the virtues of self-denial, sacrifice, 

 righteousness and chastity, made it easy for her sons 

 to dedicate themselves to her cause. But the ecstatic paeans 

 to Mother India had little connection with the way the real 

 Indian woman was treated in the country. Katherine Mayos 

 Mother India (1927) professed to hold up the mirror 

 to this reality. While Mayo was soon revealed to be far 

 from the uncommitted chronicler she was involved with 

 British officials in favour of colonial rule in India 

 her book did stir up a hornets nest. Meetings and protests 

 against the book took place all over India, as political 

 figures, social reformers, activists, artists and writers 

 joined hands to denounce the facts that Mayo had presented.

 However, Mayo had hardly aimed to alter the fate of the woman through her book. In describing the poor health of the child-wives of India or the unhygienic practices of the native midwife, Mayo tried to prove that the social backwardness of the Indians made them unfit for self-government. It was easy to argue against and refute this contention. What was less easy was to deny the truth of at least some of the points made by Mayo about the sexual beliefs of the Hindus, and the way it affected women. Mrinalini Sinha quotes Gandhis verdict on Mother India: We may repudiate the charge as it has been framed by her, but we may not repudiate the substance underlying the many allegations she has made. 

 It was the recognition of the veracity in some of Mayos remarks that partially led to the formation of a social movement, which culminated in the passing of the Child Marriage Restraint Act in 1929. And, as Sinha shows, the most remarkable development following the controversy over lowering the age of consent for marriage was the unprecedented participation of women in the debate. Instead of being passive objects of male domination or veneration, women now became both the subjects and the objects of social reform in India. Activists like Sarojini Naidu, Vijayalakshmi Pandit, Muthulakshmi Reddi or Uma Nehru, while rebutting Mayos claims, fought to transform the way womanhood was constructed in India. For the first time, Indian women had their demands attended to. 

 Although Mayo was guilty of twisting facts, Mother India was, at least, a provocative work something that cannot be said of Sinhas book. It is evident that Sinha has worked hard in putting together the details of the controversy Mother India generated. But her documentation is too dry to interest anyone but the researcher. Sinhas language is dreadfully turgid at times. Sample this: The worldwide social processes and the manifold discursive fields of the first half of the twentieth century produced the ideological vulnerability of Mayos intervention to reappropriations whose sheer multiplicity illustrates the working of a global dynamics, and so on. Is Sinha trying to compensate for the paucity of original ideas by presenting the simplest of concepts in a deliberately convoluted way?

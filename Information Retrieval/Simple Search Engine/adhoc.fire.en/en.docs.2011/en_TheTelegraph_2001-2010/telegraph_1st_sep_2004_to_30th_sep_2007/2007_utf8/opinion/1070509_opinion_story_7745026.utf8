The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Officers are not gentlemen

 Sir The conduct of the railway magistrate, Mintu Mallick, shows that the sanctity of the judicial system is under threat from within (Do job, get VIP stick, May 6). Mallick is supposed to have insisted on boarding the drivers cabin of a local train in order to avoid the crowd. He also, allegedly, questioned the slow speed of the train, something which went beyond his jurisdiction. Government servants, particularly senior officials, are prone to abuse their power. A drivers cabin, after all, is forbidden territory, and the driver, in this case, was within his rights to question Mallicks authority. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Surajit Das, Calcutta 

 Sir It is unfortunate if the railway magistrate of Sealdah has compelled the driver and the guards of a Sealdah-bound local train from Budge Budge to apologize for allegedly misbehaving with him and for proceeding at slow speed. Mallick took exception when he was asked for proof of his identity. However, railway regulations stipulate that no one can be allowed into the drivers cabin, except those with the right credentials. It is only in a corrupt third world country like India that a custodian of the law would take offence rather than appreciate a proper discharge of duty. It is even more unfortunate that the ego tussle between the railway employees triggered chaos that held up train service for five hours, much to the inconvenience of the passengers.

 Yours faithfully,

Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge 

 Sir The dispensers of justice are not above the law. The Calcutta high courts initiative to enquire into the incident at Sealdah will put an end to the speculation about who is truly guilty. However, one cannot but admire the tremendous sense of responsibility on the part of the train driver. Perhaps it is because of men like him that terrorists find it more difficult to strike in Calcutta than in Mumbai. 

 The clash, however, wasted manpower and damaged railway property. If Mintu Mallick is proven guilty, then he must be seen to have committed a grave error of judgment. Power and stature often go to the heads of important government officials. It is his shameless abuse of power that caused D.G. Vanzaras downfall. The Gujarat government is now in serious trouble for letting him do so. That is why the judiciary also needs to take steps to curb highhandedness on the part of its officials.

 Yours faithfully,

Bappaditya Pal, Calcutta

 Sir The charges against the railway magistrate, Mintu Mallick, are indeed serious. If the drivers and guards version of the incident is true, then Mallick seems to have flouted one rule after another. First, he is supposed to have identified himself verbally, without producing his identity card and pass. In fact, the driver should never have allowed Mallick to board the cabin without a pass. What if a terrorist were to board the cabin by identifying himself as a high-ranking government official? 

 Second, Mallick is alleged to have pestered the driver for speed throughout the journey. Certainly, the driver would know better about these matters. Unwarranted speed would have not only endangered the lives of passengers on the train but also those of the people in the vicinity of the railway tracks. If Mallick has forced his juniors to apologize for doing their duty, then his act is reprehensible. Measures should also be adopted to ensure that no VIP (Mallick, of course, was not one) ever causes disruption at railway stations and airports again.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir It is difficult to believe that a fracas among the railway staff cost the commuters so dearly. Perhaps a high court inquiry should also be instituted to investigate into the lathicharge on them.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir The claim of the former Pakistan foreign minister, Gohar Ayub Khan, that Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw had sold Pakistan Indias battle plans in the Fifties is illogical and unconvincing (Gohar Khan kicks up traitor dust again, May 8). Khan altogether lacks credibility and has indulged in this insinuation to boost the sale of the just-published diaries of his father, Ayub Khan. Gohar Khans aim can only be to cause discomfort to the Indian establishment and sullying the name of a reputed military officer. He does not realize that his attempt to tarnish Manekshaws image has failed miserably since even on his earlier attempt, he had got his facts horribly wrong. Gohar Khan has brought disgrace to the Pakistan army since, with or without the intelligence bought from Manekshaw, it could not win the 1965 war. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

 TACT AND AID

 Hard-nosed diplomacy often works better than mindless bombing. The six-party talks between the United States of America, China, Japan, Russia, North Korea and South Korea have yielded unexpected results. North Korea, often considered the naughty boy of the global nuclear regime, has agreed to freeze its nuclear programme. In return, the US and the other countries agreed to provide North Korea energy-aid and other concessions. North Korea had always maintained that its nuclear programme was aimed at generating energy. This need will be met immediately as it will receive gratis 50,000 tons of heavy fuel oil. To get this gift, North Korea will shut down and seal, within 60 days, its principal nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, and will also allow international nuclear inspectors back into the country. This is only the first phase of the terms that have been negotiated. If North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear facilities, it will receive 950,000 tons of oil valued at $300 million. This should, it is estimated, take care of North Koreas fuel scarcity, which hits the country especially hard during winter.

 While the freezing of the nuclear programme is the most important of the negotiations, the latter had another significant aspect. The talks marked the first thawing of relations between the US and North Korea, with the former making a promise to normalize diplomatic ties with the latter. When this takes place, another relic of the Cold War will be buried. It is often forgotten, in the euphoria that accompanied the collapse of the Iron Curtain, that the US and North Korea have technically been at war since 1953, when an armistice ended the Korean War. The context of US-North Korea relations have now completely altered. North Korea, in strategic terms, would like to counterbalance the influence of Russia and China with a new era of friendship with the US. The latter is obviously open to such overtures since it has accepted terms in 2007 that are not substantially different from the ones it had rejected in 2002.

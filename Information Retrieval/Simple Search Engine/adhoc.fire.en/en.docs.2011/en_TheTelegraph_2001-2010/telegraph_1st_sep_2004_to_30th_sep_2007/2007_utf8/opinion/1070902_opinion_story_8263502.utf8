 CHINESE CHECKERS

 A political partys past has many ways of complicating its present. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) suddenly finds itself in a similar mess, thanks to none other than its general secretary. When he launched his crusade against the civilian nuclear deal between India and the United States of America, Prakash Karat obviously had not thought of one consequence of his action. Mr Karats anti-American rhetoric has forced him and his party to face some ghosts from its past. The way Mr Karat has railed against the media for dubbing his party pro-China suggests that he has been stung by the criticism. His is the kind of discomfort one has in facing unpleasant truths. Yet, while defending his party against the charge of being pro-Chinese, he argued that the US wanted New Delhi to act as a counterweight against Beijing. Only two days earlier, Peoples Daily, the organ of the Chinese communist party, had exactly the same thing to say about the Indo-US deal. It said that the deal would bolster the USs efforts to contain China. The Chinese party thus confirms what Mr Karat denies the fact that he is really Chinas voice. 

 It is not that this was a secret in Indian politics. Mr Karat has only revived old political memories that his party likes people to forget. The people would now remember that the CPI(M) had always been pro-Beijing, just as the Communist Party of India had been pro-Moscow. They would recall that Indian communists had refused to condemn the Chinese aggression in the Himalaya in 1962. The Soviet aggression on former Czechoslovakia in 1968 rattled even the CPI. At its national council meeting, a fiercely debated resolution in support of Moscows action passed with a majority of only one vote. But the CPI(M) never condemned that aggression, just as it saw nothing wrong with the Soviet armys tanks rolling into Afghanistan or the Chinese annexing Vietnamese territory. Mr Karat sees the Indo-US nuclear deal as part of Washingtons imperialist designs. Obviously, he has no problems with communist imperialism. 

 However, Mr Karat has another chance to redeem his partys past. He can answer the charge against his party by simply doing a few things. Let him and his party condemn the former Soviet Union for its aggressions in erstwhile Czechoslovakia, in Hungary in 1956, and in Afghanistan in 1979. He could also condemn China for the Himalayan aggression of 1962. China has occupied large chunks of Indian territory on the Himalayan border. Let the CPI(M) organize protests against it outside the Chinese embassy in New Delhi. Better still, it could give a new meaning to bandhs by calling a Bangla bandh to support Indias claim on the annexed lands. Mr Karat has unwittingly forced a nationalism test on his party that it might find difficult to pass.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SLOWER BALL

 Kerry Packer caused a revolution in the world of cricket. In India, a country that accepts change only very very slowly, a revolution is difficult to think of. But, there is no doubt that like many other institutions in India, the Board of Control for Cricket in India is beginning to feel the winds of change. Given BCCIs monopoly position, and given the fact that India has opened up to market forces more than a decade ago, it is surprising that the challenge has taken so long to come. The Indian Cricket League has emerged as a rival to BCCI. This was predictable because BCCI makes huge profits, and there is more money to be made in Indian cricket. The ICL, the brainchild of Subhash Chandra of Zee, has challenged the monopoly of BCCI. What remains to be seen is whether ICL will have the kind of impact that Packer had, first on Australian cricket and then on cricket in general. This impact, in retrospect, was completely beneficial even though Packer had not been driven by his love of cricket, but by business motives. Mr Chandra also wants to earn profits through cricket, but the implications of his venture for cricket remain unknown except in the most general terms.

 These general terms cannot be ignored. Indian cricketers will now have a choice instead of being tied down by contracts written up by BCCI. But the attractiveness of choice and the lure of greater lucre may not be enough to draw cricketers, especially the more successful ones in India. The ICL may have already begun on the wrong foot by inviting cricketers from abroad who are well past their prime. Packer succeeded because he got the best players of the time. The most important problem that Mr Chandra faces is the peculiar nexus that exists between cricket and patriotism. Most cricketers want to play for their country. Packer managed to break this nexus, but only partially. There is also the problem of venues: almost all existing cricket grounds, where cricket of some standing can be played, are under the control of BCCI or of state associations subservient to it. Despite these problems and the resultant uncertainties, a breakthrough has been made and that bizarre ambience of amateur sports that surrounds Indian cricket has been removed. The BCCI will now have to learn to survive in a competitive environment, something Indian cricketers learnt to do a long time ago.

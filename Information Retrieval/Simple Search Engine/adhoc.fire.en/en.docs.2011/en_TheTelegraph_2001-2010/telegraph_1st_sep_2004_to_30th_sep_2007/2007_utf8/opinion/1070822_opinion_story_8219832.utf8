 BABIES FOR A PRICE

 It is possible to get rich killing unborn girls. It also seems possible to make a lot of money dealing in unwanted babies of either sex, though boys fetch more. The police have possibly come upon a trafficking racket based in a private nursing home in Dum Dum. The owners allegedly get unmarried parents to write off their babies, delivered in the nursing home, to be sold to childless couples for a few lakhs. The nexus is fairly wide, although its full extent is still not known; the police may have only got the tip of the iceberg nursing-home owners, doctors, attendants, unmarried parents, fertility clinics and couples looking to buy babies. And diverse social realities converge to sustain such a nexus.

 There is greed, of course, and a private health sector that is still relatively unpoliced and hence able to get away with all kinds of irregularity. But there is also the combination of social stigma and sexual disempowerment. What kind of control do unwed mothers have over their own sexuality, social existence and the destiny of their illegitimate child? And why can traffickers force young, unwed parents to abandon their babies so easily? A recent survey in Maharashtra has shown that only 33 per cent of unmarried women are aware that they can get pregnant after their first sexual encounter. Only 55.4 per cent unmarried women have heard about condoms; only 18 per cent of unmarried women and 39.3 per cent of married women know about the proper use of condoms. (In all cases, the equivalent figures for men are much higher.) The survey will move to other states as well, but the figures in Maharashtra (where the HIV/AIDS situation is grim) reveal the extent to which a young, unmarried mother in India would be lacking in control over her own sexual decisions and choices and their consequences. The vicious circle of social taboo and ignorance within larger structures of inequality and corruption is exactly right for such a form of trafficking to thrive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HORSE SENSE AND NAMING NONSENSE 

 - Being a race correspondent is a lot of hard work, but 

 choosing pseudonyms is fun

 AGAINST ALL ODDS

 There was a time, not so long 

 back, when children, considered worthless, were forced into 

 the sea, to become khalasis in the merchant navy. 

 Job opportunities then, for those with moderate academic 

 achievements, were very limited. Even a university degree 

 was not much of a help, when scores of engineers and doctors 

 scoured the vacancy columns of newspapers for a job, any 

 job. It was hardly surprising that those who failed to produce 

 shining proof of academic excellence were left to make a 

 living from odd jobs, as commission agents or small traders. 

 To put it very bluntly, for most, it was a beggars cant 

 be choosers situation. 

 That was exactly how it was with 

 me, though I did have all good intentions of becoming an 

 engineer. Lets say fate pushed me towards horse racing, 

 a British legacy. In the prime of my youth, I simply hated 

 it. I had no reasons to love it, since some of my close 

 relatives had squandered away their fortune gambling on 

 horses. Friends, and friends of friends everyone seemed 

 to have an uncle or a great grandparent whose love of horses 

 had turned him from a prince to a pauper. 

 The stories made me resolve not 

 to seek an easy path to doom. I had been, otherwise, getting 

 along in life trading re-refined burnt lubricants. However, 

 always preferring to see before believing, I accompanied 

 friends to the racecourse on a Derby Day, and fell in love 

 with the graceful, galloping creatures.

 The love remained, and even grew, 

 but it was unaccompanied by any desire to visit the racecourse 

 again, leave alone an urge to gamble. I would occasionally 

 buy race books and study the arithmetic of handicaps and 

 weights, and follow the daily results in the newspapers. 

 My equine passion also prompted me to make visits to Free 

 School Street in search of old books on the subject by reputed 

 authors. 

 Then I was down with paratyphoid.

 The long recovery period after 

 the illness changed it all. One fine day, I was at the racecourse, 

 and all on my own. The wisdom I had earned paid dividends 

 that day in the Calcutta Gold Cup. I won pots of money, 

 thanks to Mr Mauritius, a grey horse ridden by a raw apprentice 

 jockey, Nelson Reuben, who would go on to become a champion 

 rider.

 That was when I decided to devote 

 more time to my favourite animals. It took a long time for 

 another Mauritius to happen, but I was irrevocably hooked, 

 making regular visits to the course early in the morning 

 for the track trials. My popularity as a tipster also grew, 

 and I started dreaming about writing a newspaper column. 

 The break, as they say in filmdom, 

 came in the early Eighties. In the first week, I struggled 

 for hours to write a short intro for the selection copy. 

 However, the pleasure of seeing my name in print was incentive 

 enough. By name, I mean my nom de plume, of course. 

 I called myself The Sniper that was the angry young man 

 in me, fighting against the system.

 As the anger subsided, choosing 

 the name became fun. Race correspondents were once fond 

 of using horsy names such as Ashwaraj, Ashwamitra, Chetak, 

 Pegasus or Early Bird. These days, the idea is to go one 

 up on rival correspondents. At least, names like Supermax, 

 Rustam, Star Racer and Srimax, suggest so. But what about 

 Honky Dory? This I chose at the advice of a sports editor 

 who wanted a funny pseudonym.

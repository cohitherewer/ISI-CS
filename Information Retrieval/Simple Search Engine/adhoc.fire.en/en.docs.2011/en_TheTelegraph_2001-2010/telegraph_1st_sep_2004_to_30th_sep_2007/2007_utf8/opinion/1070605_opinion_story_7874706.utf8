 Extracts from the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement

 These Guiding Principles address 

 the specific needs of internally displaced persons worldwide....

 For the purposes of these Principles, 

 internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons 

 who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their 

 homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as 

 a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, 

 situations of generalized violence, violations of human 

 rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have 

 not crossed an internationally recognized State border. 

 Internally displaced persons shall enjoy, in full equality, 

 the same rights and freedoms under international and domestic 

 law as do other persons in their country. They shall not 

 be discriminated against in the enjoyment of any rights 

 and freedoms on the ground that they are internally displaced. 

 These principles are without prejudice to individual criminal 

 responsibility under international law, in particular relating 

 to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 

 National authorities have the primary duty and responsibility 

 to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to internally 

 displaced persons within their jurisdiction. 

 Internally displaced persons have the right to request and 

 to receive protection and humanitarian assistance from these 

 authorities. They shall not be persecuted or punished for 

 making such a request. 

 These principles shall be applied without discrimination 

 of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion 

 or belief, political or other opinion, national, ethnic 

 or social origin, legal or social status, age, disability, 

 property, birth, or on any other. 

 Certain internally displaced persons, such as children, 

 especially unaccompanied minors, expectant mothers, mothers 

 with young children, female heads of household, persons 

 with disabilities and elderly persons, shall be entitled 

 to protection and assistance required by their condition 

 and to treatment which takes into account their special 

 needs. 

 Internally displaced persons, whether or not their liberty 

 has been restricted, shall be protected in particular against: 

 (a) Rape, mutilation, torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading 

 treatment or punishment, and other outrages upon personal 

 dignity, such as acts of gender-specific violence, forced 

 prostitution and any form of indecent assault; 

 (b) Slavery or any contemporary form of slavery, such 

 as sale into marriage, sexual exploitation, or forced 

 labour of children; 

 (c) Acts of violence intended to spread terror... 

 Internally displaced persons have: 

 (a) The right to seek safety in another part of the 

 country; 

 (b) The right to leave their country; 

 (c) The right to seek asylum in another country; and 

 (d) The right to be protected against forcible return 

 to or resettlement in any place where their life, safety, 

 liberty and/or health would be at risk. 

 All internally displaced persons have the right to know 

 the fate and whereabouts of missing relatives. 

 The authorities concerned shall endeavour to establish the 

 fate and whereabouts of internally displaced persons reported 

 missing, and cooperate with relevant international organizations 

 engaged in this task. They shall inform the next of kin 

 on the progress of the investigation and notify them of 

 any result. 

 The authorities concerned shall endeavour to collect and 

 identify the mortal remains of those deceased, prevent their 

 despoliation or mutilation, and facilitate the return of 

 those remains to the next of kin or dispose of them respectfully... 

 All internally displaced persons have the right to an adequate 

 standard of living. 

 At the minimum, regardless of the circumstances, and without 

 discrimination, competent authorities shall provide internally 

 displaced persons with and ensure safe access to: essential 

 food and potable water; basic shelter and housing; appropriate 

 clothing; and essential medical services and sanitation. 

 Special efforts should be made to ensure the full participation 

 of women in the planning and distribution of these basic 

 supplies. 

 All wounded and sick internally displaced persons as well 

 as those with disabilities shall receive to the fullest 

 extent practicable and with the least possible delay, the 

 medical care and attention they require, without distinction 

 on any grounds other than medical ones. When necessary, 

 internally displaced persons shall have access to psychological 

 and social services. 

 Special attention should be paid to the health needs of 

 women, including access to female health care providers 

 and services, such as reproductive health care, as well 

 as appropriate counselling for victims of sexual and other 

 abuses. 

 CONCLUDED

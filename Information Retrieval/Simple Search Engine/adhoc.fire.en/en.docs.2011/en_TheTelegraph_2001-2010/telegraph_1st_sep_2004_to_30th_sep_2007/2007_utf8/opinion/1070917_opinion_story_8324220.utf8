 JUST VIOLENCE

 It takes only a moment for everyday spaces in Indian cities, towns and villages, full of ordinary people, to turn into sites of collective violence. And the violence is usually of extraordinary proportions. Sixteen lorries torched and the police stoned for an hour in Durgapur; a Nainital schoolboy clobbered to death by his classmates while the other students and teachers look on; ten alleged thieves lynched, three have their eyes gouged out and one dragged behind a police bike in Bihar while the mob watches or actively participates. These are just a few recent instances of extreme mob violence in India. Cutting across the entire social spectrum and the urban-rural divide, and occurring with increasing frequency in places of learning and care (schools, universities, hospitals), such incidents show how frighteningly volatile civic life has become. Yet there is always a brutal and irrational logic behind each such eruption of violence. There seems to be a shared feeling, which might randomly crystallize just about anywhere in the country, that a cumulative sense of grievous and continued injustice and powerlessness justifies unified violent action. This action may be unspeakably cruel or irrational in its disproportion with regard to the original offence. But the letter or spirit of the law, as civilized society understands and practises it, fails to provide the proper framework for understanding this form of human behaviour.

 Two factors contribute to the extreme roughness of such a sense of injustice born out of injustice. First, the actual and repeated failure of the State particularly its law and order or civic machinery as a set of public institutions guaranteeing protection and redress to ordinary citizens. Second, brutal inequalities in the distribution of both power and resources, reinforced by systemic feudalism, corruption or lack of accountability. Collective violence exists, therefore, in the dangerously unstable interface between power and powerlessness where disempowerment suddenly turns into bizarrely self-destructive forms of power within a chronically unequal society.

 Letters to Editor

 Turning green

 Sir The report, Maidan saved (Jan 30), comes as a breath of fresh air to nature-lovers. It is unfortunate that the courts have to step in whenever the government and the administrative authorities collude with the business lobby to defile the environment. The Calcutta high courts verdict on the book fair is a well-deserved lesson for those who flout environmental laws. It is evident that the West Bengal state government lacks the will to keep its promises the chief minister had promised that the 2006 book fair would be the last one to be held in Maidan or to implement laws. The same attitude botches attempts to enforce the norms of vehicular emission. 

 The book fair in Maidan may have been banned, but various political parties and religious organizations will continue to use its grounds, and litter it, by holding their congregations there. These must be banned too.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Brahmo, Calcutta

 Sir The Calcutta high courts ruling on the book fair has come as bad news for thousands of book lovers across the state and outside. But the controversy does not show the Publishers and Booksellers Guild in a very favourable light. The guild should have looked for another venue for the fair in advance instead of cajoling the chief minister to get the necessary permissions from the army and the pollution board. In fact, the chief minister has placed himself in a spot by championing its cause. Such blatant lobbying, in spite of being aware of the environmental fallout, cuts a sorry picture of the man. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asad Rauf, Calcutta

 Sir The Publishers and Booksellers Guild is an organization of businessmen, and all businessmen work for profit. Profit-making is allowed by law. To those who cannot afford to buy books from expensive bookshops, the guild has been offering books at a discount at the annual fair. This year, these buyers will be deprived of the opportunity. There is no denying that our environment should be made pollution-free. But why should it be done at such a heavy cost? Several fairs are organized during festivals. International cricket matches are played at Eden Gardens, where large numbers assemble. Clubs have football matches, which attract a huge crowd. All these events cause air and sound pollution. Should we ban all of them? 

 Efforts should be made to find an alternative site for book fairs, but can one be sure that lovers of a pollution-free environment will not raise a hue and cry about the suitability of that site too? 

 Yours faithfully,

M.K. Anwar, Calcutta

 Sir Legislators are mightily upset at the growing stature of the judiciary in India. They complain that they are equally important in a democratic set up and should have a greater say in matters concerning the public. But it is because the peoples representatives are unable to perform their duties and are corrupt to the core that the people are left with no alternative but to turn to the judiciary for help. 

 The high court judgment on the book fair is undoubtedly a setback for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has had to face a slew of them of late. The first was the defeat of the police chief, Prasun Mukherjee, in the first round of the elections for the Cricket Association of Bengal. Then came the lost battle for a special economic zone in Nandigram, and now the snub for playing mentor to a group of dishonest booksellers. Bhattacharjee should come back to his senses. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir Human beings are generally averse to change. But alterations have to be made, keeping in mind the greater needs of the society. To protect the environment, it has become necessary to shift the book fair from the Maidan, which serves as the lungs for Calcutta. The change, quite naturally, is being resisted. But with time, the attitude will change. Smoking in public places has become restricted since people are now more health- conscious. A similar change in perspective will help the shifting of the book fair possible. All book- lovers must put pressure on the government to create an alternative permanent site for fairs of all kinds. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir The chief minister has met his match in the Calcutta high court. This time, the judges have managed to expose the state governments chicanery. Ordinary citizens of this state now know that, despite the lapses in the judicial system, the long arm of the law reaches out far.

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir Has the Maidan been really saved from pollution? The Calcutta Book Fair is the most important public event in this city. Undoubtedly, it is the responsibility of the organizers to clean up the site, a task which they have failed to do every time. But will the pollution level in Maidan and the entire city be reduced considerably by deporting the book fair? The ban on the book fair in the Maidan is certainly a great loss for every Calcuttan. 

 Yours faithfully,

Moumita Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir One should not interpret the high court ruling as anyones victory or defeat. The judiciary has merely acted the protector of citizens rights (Clear the green, Jan 30). The verdict is a message to law-breakers that no compromise will be made on matters concerning the environment. Relocating the book fair will not dampen the spirit of book-lovers. Now that the people have woken up to the need for conservation of the greens, all rallies and assemblies should be banished from the heart of the city to save it from marauders. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

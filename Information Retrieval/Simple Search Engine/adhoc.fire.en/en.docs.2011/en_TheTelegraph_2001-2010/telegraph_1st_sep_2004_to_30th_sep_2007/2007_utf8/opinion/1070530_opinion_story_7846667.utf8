 MOCK HAPPINESS

 It must be a very unique country that judges progress by what its ruler calls Gross National Happiness. Bhutans first-ever experiment with democracy is also suitably unprecedented. The two rounds of mock elections that the country has had, as dress rehearsals for next years real polls, demonstrate a curious people power. Mondays vote, as much as the one held earlier, is a confirmation, if one were needed, of the peoples complete trust in the monarchy and the countrys Buddhist tradition. But it has ano- ther serious message. Of the 48 constituencies which went to the polls, the modernists won in only one. They wanted industrialization as a major means of the countrys economic development. Every country may have its own ways to come to terms with a modern political concept like democracy. Even the conventional ideas of industrialization may not help the economy of a small, mountainous country like Bhutan. But it would be a pity if some cruel facts of Bhutanese life are ignored in an attempt to perpetuate the myth of the Shangri-la. The majority of the Bhutanese may love their king, but they live in grinding poverty and without many of the basic freedoms that make democracy meaningful. 

 However, the worst aspect of Bhutans transition is the denial of all rights to large numbers of its people of Nepalese origin. About 100,000 such people have been forced to live in refugee camps in Nepal for more than 15 years. The clashes between groups of these people and the security forces on the India-Nepal border highlight their desperate conditions as well as Thimphus total abrogation of its responsibility for them. The protests by these people also point to a major flaw in the Bhutanese experiments with democracy. Democratic exercises in Bhutan will lack legitimacy if such large numbers of people are denied their citizenship and other political rights. Also, the Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin will continue to be a source of diplomatic tensions between Thimphu and Kathmandu. If several rounds of talks between the two have failed to resolve the issue, the blame lies mostly with Bhutan. Thimphus refusal to accept most of the refugees as its citizens is historically and ethically untenable. Perhaps the international community should do more than it has done all these years to help the refugees return home.

 LOOK BACK IN DESPAIR 

 Sudeep Paul

 Fifth Column

 Beginning June 5, forty years 

 ago, what ensued for the next six days would put the most 

 imaginative in Hollywood to shame. In those six days of 

 June 1967, Israel had demolished the military might of Egypt, 

 Syria and Jordan in 20th centurys most famous pre-emptive 

 strikes. At the end of the war, Israel had seized the Sinai 

 Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, East Jerusalem 

 and the West Bank from Jordan and the Golan Heights from 

 Syria. 

 The genesis of half-a-centurys 

 Middle Eastern mess lies in this brief but immensely significant 

 conflict. The war immediately produced about 250,000 Palestinian 

 refugees a humanitarian disaster with adverse consequences 

 for peace. The war also emasculated the secular Arab nationalism 

 symbolized by Gamal Abdel-Nassers Egypt, paving the way 

 for Islamic fundamentalism to fill the ideological vacuum 

 in the Arab world. 

 For Israel, the irony remains 

 that the war that secured its boundaries (by extending them 

 beyond the borders determined by the 1948 UN resolution), 

 and established its undisputed military superiority in the 

 region, also made it more insecure than ever. Israel will 

 not, and cannot, undo 1967. Yet, nothing less will allow 

 it to exist in peace. Because nothing less will restore 

 dignity and a sense of justice to Palestinians. 

 Soon after the war, Dean Rusk, 

 Lyndon B. Johnsons secretary of state, warned that if Israel 

 did not vacate the West Bank, Palestinians would never cease 

 their efforts to regain it. Forty years on, there are about 

 450,000 Jews in the occupied territories, and Israel is 

 still unwilling to return the whole of the occupied West 

 Bank to Palestinians for a state of their own. While Israel 

 justifies the occupation on grounds of security against 

 Palestinian fidayeen attacks, in reality, it protects 

 Jewish settlements with state resources and makes the Palestinians 

 feel that terrorist strikes are the only weapon against 

 subjugation. The chances of the adversaries breaking out 

 of this circular logic are still slim.

 The dead road

 While the Arab-Israeli conflict 

 has always been about land and living space, Israels intransigence 

 also reveals the significance of the River of Jordan and 

 the Sea of Galilee that supplement its water resources. 

 In 1965, the Arabs had embarked on the Headwater Diversion 

 Plan that would have deprived Israel (and the Sea of Galilee) 

 of the Jordans water. The Israeli Defense Forces had attacked 

 the project site in August, 1965. But Israel realized that 

 its water security depended on its ability to control this 

 supply line and, for that, it needed the West Bank. In 2006, 

 Israels cumulative deficit in renewable water resources 

 was about two billion cubic meters a volume matching its 

 annual consumption. In the near future, the regions fate 

 might be increasingly determined by water wars.

 Against the backdrop of the failure 

 of the Camp David and the Oslo Accords, the Fatahs disappointing 

 record and the deadlock between Israel and Hamas, the geopolitics 

 of the region has acquired new dimensions, while the old 

 ones remain intact. The road to peace is clear Israel should 

 withdraw to its pre-1967 boundaries by vacating the West 

 Bank and the Golan Heights. The Palestinians, especially 

 Hamas, should recognize Israels legitimacy and stop terrorist 

 attacks against civilians. But four decades after Israel 

 acquired the status of occupier, this simple formula is 

 as useless as always.

 In 1967, the Jews made their aliyah 

 to the ancient homelands of Judaea and Samaria and the Old 

 City. In the Israeli subconscious, June 1967 remains a messianic 

 moment. Israel will continue to believe that its claim to 

 the occupied territories is legitimate since the land once 

 belonged to the Jews. The Arabs will continue to despair 

 at the Jews in what was their home for centuries till the 

 other day.

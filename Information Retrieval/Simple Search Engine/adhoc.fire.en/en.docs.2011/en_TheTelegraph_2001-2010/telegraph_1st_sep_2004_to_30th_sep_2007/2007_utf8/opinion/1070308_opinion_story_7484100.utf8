 PAST MASTERS LESSONS

 NEHA SAHAY

 Learn from Comrade Lei Feng! The air is full of this hoary revolutionary slogan. March 5, Learning from Comrade Lei Feng Day is actually being observed in post-Mao China. Lei Feng was a soldier who died at the age of 22 in 1962, when New China was still being built. Orphaned at seven and adopted by the Peoples Liberation Army, his selflessness and devotion to the country as well as to Mao became legendary in 1963, when Mao declared March 5 as the day to commemorate him. Schoolchildren would go out of their way to do good deeds on March 5. A 70-year-old recalls, All your old household appliances could be repaired on that day!

 During the Cultural Revolution, Lei Feng became a cult figure. He came to be known as Chairman Maos Good Soldier, and posters, stories, films, and textbooks on him, based on his diary, became part of a Learn from Lei Feng campaign. Apparently, people are still learning. Today, March 5 activities are organized on a scale far bigger than Maos birth and death anniversaries, and not just for students. They include blood-donation drives, cleaning public phones, doing charity... Last year, in one city, foreigners drove shoppers home from a mall, as part of learning from Lei Feng, and university students offered to be interpreters for the foreigners (they often do so anyway).

 A recent survey revealed that while 22 per cent Chinese have never heard of Lei, 40 per cent regard him as an ideal. Even the official media is surprised at the continued admiration for someone so outdated. In his spare time, Lei taught primary-school children. One of them recalled that he had asked them what they wanted to do when they grew up. When they replied scientist, artist, a disappointed Lei asked, Why not a farmer or worker?

 Deeds and donts

 This episode may not be part of the textbook lesson on Lei Feng taught currently to Chinas little emperors (as children of Chinas one-child families are known). Farmers and workers figure on the fringes of the new, competitive, glittering China. In fact, about 10 years back, when youngsters were still capable of Lei Feng deeds, such as giving free haircuts to the poor, and voluntarily repairing their cycles and shoes, hairdressers and mechanics would rage at them! Todays Chinas urban kids no longer have those skills!

 Lei Feng has been successfully commercialized. A restaurateur has put his photograph on the door, stories about his love for leather jackets and motorbikes circulate on the Net, and theres even a condom named after him, with the well-known picture of him holding a gun on the pack. A mother found the pack in her sons backpack and raised a furore.

 The company was fined for erotic content, but not for using Lei Fengs name and picture. (They even had condoms with the slogan, Chairman Mao Leads us Forward, with Maos picture.) More interesting is the online game called Learn from Lei Feng. Here, the player must perform good deeds and battle with secret agents to reach higher levels and finally win the treasure: Chairman Maos Red Book, autographed by the Leader himself for the winner! Beginners to the game can darn socks (even in those frugal days, Lei was ridiculed by other soldiers for his darned socks). As their scores increase, the players clothes get plainer, and their good deeds tougher, extending to volunteering on construction sites. A Guangzhou teenager said, Sometimes the enemy was very strong. The fight almost exhausted me, so I would go to talk with the Party secretary to replenish my vitality at once. He hoped he would soon get to meet the Chairman. This game is the first in a series called Register of Chinese Heroes, commissioned by the government to counter the popular sex-and-violence video games. It would be ironic indeed if the series ends up popularizing Mao Zedong!

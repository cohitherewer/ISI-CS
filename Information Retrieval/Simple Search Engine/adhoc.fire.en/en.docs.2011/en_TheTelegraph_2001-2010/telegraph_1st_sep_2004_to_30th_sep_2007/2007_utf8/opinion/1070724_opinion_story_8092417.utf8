 Mean streets

Costume drama

 Sir Political correctness can often turn a light-hearted event into a solemn affair. This is proved by the hue and cry over Prashant Tamangs latest performance at the Indian Idol (Idol faces stereotype music, July 21). The Gorkhas, who have found Tamangs costume of a chowkidar so offensive, seem to have forgotten what a brilliant singer he is, and how perfectly he impersonated the role played by Pran in Kasauti in 1974. Dressing up in a particular way often adds charm and novelty to a performance, and Tamangs decision to don the uniform of a police constable should not be loaded with political meanings. The Gorkha community should try to overcome their regional sentiments and stop assuming victimhood on behalf of Tamang.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad

 Sir Recently, the Delhi police imposed certain rules and regulation on people from the Northeast regarding what they should eat, how they should dress and conduct themselves in public so as not to provoke attacks on them. The assumption behind this kind of stereotyping is that these people are uncivilized. However, when people from North Bengal decided to react strongly to Prashant Tamangs being dressed up as a chowkidar for the Indian Idol show, the rest of the country found their response excessive. They do not find this kind of stereotyping that people from the hills are only fit to be constables uncivilized. India is supposed to be a multicultural haven. Yet we have this special category of people from the Northeast (that is, those with Mongoloid features), but not similar divisions for people from the Southwest or Northwest. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Prashant Tamang has made people from North Bengal proud after making it to the last ten of Indian Idol. Tamangs rendition of Bolega to bologe ki bolta hai in the recent episode of the show was amazing. Yet his fans have got furious with the organizers for making him dress like a chowkidar. It appears that these people are either ignorant of the original picturization of the song, or they wish to create a controversy out of nothing. If Tamang goes on to win, would it be any less great for his wearing the chowkidars dress?

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Being an Indian-Nepali, I was thrilled when Prashant Tamang got through the auditions of Indian Idol. My friends and I unfailingly tuned in to the programme, and voted regularly for him through SMS. However, when the organizers made Tamang wear a chowkidars uniform, they defamed the entire Nepali community. Had they any sense of the traditional Nepali dress, they would perhaps have made a more judicious choice. I wonder if it was at all necessary to make the contestants of a music talent hunt dress up as sahib, memsahib and chowkidar? It is not as if Indian Idol is the only show of its kind. There are others like Sa Re Ga Ma Pa and The Voice of India. But Indian Idol seems to be based entirely on ideas imported from abroad and on cultural assumptions that would put any self-respecting Indian to shame. It was also astonishing to hear that the spokesperson for the channel did not find the garb of a chowkidar insulting because some weeks back, another contestant had dressed as a Tamilian. Will someone please tell him that the uniform of a chowkidar is not the national costume of the Gorkhas?

 Yours faithfully,

Pushpalata Rai, Darjeeling

 Sir In Hindi films, Bengalis have long been portrayed as clownish or cowardly. But far from protesting, Bengalis throng to the theatres to watch these films. They should take a lesson from the Gorkha community.

 Yours faithfully,

 Killer behind the wheels

 Sir The untimely demise of little Kaustav Bhattacharya has left Calcuttans shocked (Schoolboy dies in illegal but inescapable pool van, July 20). The accident was clearly caused by reckless driving. It is amazing how people behind the wheels tend to forget that several other lives within and outside the vehicle are dependent on the way they drive. But surprisingly, in India, this job, which comes with a lot of responsibility, is mostly handled by people with very little education and patience. Obtaining a driving licence is very easy here, with a few hundred rupees as bribe. This system needs to stop immediately. Drivers need to be examined more thoroughly before they are allowed to take the wheels. The government should also amend the laws related to driving on Indian streets so that reckless and negligent drivers are severely punished.

 Yours faithfully,

G.C. Biswas, Barasat

 Sir Road accidents have now become a daily affair in Calcutta. Our killer roads have most recently claimed the nine-year-old Kaustav Bhattacharya. It was only after this incident that the everyone, including the media, seems to have woken up to the way people violate traffic rules in the city. One keeps seeing little children without helmets travelling on two-wheelers with their protected parents. There are buses racing with each other to go ahead, pedestrians scurrying down crowded streets with little regard to zebra-crossings, traffic signals or other safety rules. If educated citizens keep flouting road-safety measures, how on earth can accidents be avoided? 

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

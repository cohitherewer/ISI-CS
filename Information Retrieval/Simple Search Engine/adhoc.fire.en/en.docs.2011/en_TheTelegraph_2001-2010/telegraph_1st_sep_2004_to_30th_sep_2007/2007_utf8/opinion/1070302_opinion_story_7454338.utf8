 MOHANDAS: THE TRUE STORY OF A MAN, HIS PEOPLE AND THE EMPIRE 

 By Rajmohan Gandhi, Viking, Rs 650

 The prerogative comes from a sense of belonging; a grandson writes a book on his grandfather, one of the greatest figures in our epoch, and dares to name it Mohandas. That is, however, the only liberty Rajmohan Gandhi takes. Mohandas, running into 700-odd pages, is an impeccable exercise in objectivity. Personal equations and non-equations are not allowed to cloud the narrative. Rajmohan Gandhi acknowledges what needs to be acknowledged as being borrowed from other biographies on Mahatma Gandhi. He quotes extensively from Gandhis writings in small-time journals during both his student days in London and his first experiments with satyagraha in South Africa. And, of course, while covering events from the Twenties onwards, Rajmohan relies a great deal on Gandhis writings in Harijan and Young India; at the same time, he refers to observations of other people on matters even tangentially related to affairs Gandhi was involved in. 

 In structure, the opus sticks to a strict chronological sequence. Beginning with the nascent years in Porbander and Rajkot, Rajmohan travels with his grandfather to London, is back in Rajkot and Bombay, proceeds to South Africa and, from then on, there is the constant shuffling between India and the dark continent, until it is the second decade of the last century. From then on, the Gandhi saga assumes a kind of unilinearity. He has already been acclaimed by overwhelming sections of the nation as the Mahatma. Rajmohan, though, does not forsake the vow of total dispassion. He states facts, arranges received comments on the facts, appends additional material he has himself gathered, the impression is still one of riding a boat on an even keel. It is, all told, a remarkable performance. This biography ought to be read over and over again if not at one gulp, in instalments to fully appreciate the magnitude of the authors achievement. 

 To the present reader, the most appealing chapters of the book are those dealing with the emergence of the persona of the Mahatma as Mahatma his intense soul-searchings on arrival in South Africa and his conversion to the philosophy of turning-the-other-cheek, the rock on which the doctrine of non-violence was founded. The depiction of Gandhis forlorn days, Noakhali and after August 1947, with his dream of Indo-Muslim unity lying shattered, has a similar magnetic attraction. The bareness of Rajmohans recital of moods and events heightens the poignancy. 

 Rajmohans reluctance to assume the role of a commentator leaves the reviewer with no choice but to pick, on his own, some episodes from Gandhis sojourn through life that should command the attention of an argumentative critic. The forced company of machine politicians over a continuously long stretch, in any case, could not but lead, now and then, to a certain cramping of the mind. That apart, this man, the Mahatma, greatness notwithstanding, was not immune to committing errors of judgment. Perhaps the most crucial of such errors, which cast a permanent shadow on the Indian polity, was when, during his early days in Transvaal, inspired by his friend Sheth Tyeb, Gandhi decided to stump the imprimatur of religiosity on overtly political issues. From there, the transition to the pledge to usher in Ramrajya in independent India was an inevitability. The mixing of religion with the struggle for freedom was horrid chemistry. The Gandhian dream of Ramrajya did not, at the end, unite the Indian people, it divided them further, and partition was the dnouement.

 Or consider his reluctance to endorse Subhas Chandra Bose as Congress president for a second term. One major reason, according to Rajmohan, was the Mahatmas anxiety to install Abul Kalam Azad as party chief to counter M.A. Jinnahs spreading influence. Superstructure does not constitute the base though; Azad lived in Calcutta, but he had no base amongst the Muslim masses in Bengal. The man with such a base, A.K. Fazlul Huq, was rudely turned away by the Congress in 1937 with the concurrence of Gandhi. That changed qualitatively the contours of Indias destiny. 

 Does not Rajmohan dwell somewhat excessively on Gandhis being smitten by the charm of Sarala Devi Chaudhurani? Such chance encounters are only natural in public life. It was conceivably Gandhis sense of guilt, stemming from an awareness of how unfairly he had in the past treated his wife, Kasturba, that was at work. He was evidently not embarrassed when another equally eminent lady, again Bengali by birth, Sarojini Naidu, would flirtatiously address him as her mickey mouse. On the other hand, Gandhis idiosyncratic experiments with brahmacharya can certainly raise a few eyebrows. His seeming insensitivity to the strain caused to the two young damsels he chose as his partners in these experiments one of them his own grand-niece is, to say the least, bemusing. 

 But a great man is a great man for all that; the greatness lies in the fact that the person concerned can, when the occasion demands, soar above mundane considerations. Perhaps the most heart-rending incident which finds mention in the book is the last meeting between Gandhi and his dissolute eldest son, Harilal Abdulla Hiralal Gandhi, the latter showering cruel invectives on his father, the father maintaining his impassivity. Equally touching, at another level, is Gandhis making gentle fun of his youngest son, Devadas, who would invite all and sundry for a meal at his New Delhi home, but never once his father, the Mahatma.

 Despite Rajmohans guard, a streak of passion manages to infiltrate at the very end of the book: it is the fading of a long day at Birla House, the Mahatma, leaning on the shoulders of his two young companions, slowly advances towards the site of the prayer meeting, the assassins bullet finds its target

 The author nonetheless should have no qualms. Mahatma Gandhi was a votary of restraint; this book exemplifies, magnificently such restraint. The grandfather would have approved of Rajmohans Mohandas.

 SMOOTH DESIRES, SMOOTHER OPERATORS

 ROVING EYE

 The sights and sounds of a land where elections are just another event on the festive calendar

 Local colour

 Election time in Uttar Pradesh and the campaign catches on fast. 

 A bizarre assortment of images confront you. A mentally deranged person, painted in alternate shades of red and green, the colours of the Samajwadi Party, strolls down the streets, shouting into his paper-horn. Around him, other, equally amazing forms of life lumber through the scorching heat. 

 Who would have imagined, for instance, a herd of elephants earnestly campaigning for behen Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party, increasing the traffic confusion in Deoria (a small district town close to Gorakhpur in eastern UP)? The pachyderms slowly cruise in the summer heat, flies buzzing around them. The look in their eyes is drowsy, as if they have just made a long, tiring tour of the neighbouring villages and towns. Even more strikingly, each of them has an elephant painted in white on its flanks!

 Apart from this jumbled world of human and animal forms, there are inanimate presences posters, billboards, graffitis drawing your eye towards them. In the capital city, Lucknow, you dont have the characteristic wall-writings that you witness in abundance in Bengal. There are, however, the usual, ubiquitous two liners in white lime, covered up by sensational announcements of the sex-clinic of the famous Hakim Imran: the man who has a cure for AIDS.

 Rahulji ki baat par, button dabegi haath par, says a small Congress graffiti in Aminabad, scribbled on an ancient building dating back to the times of the nawabs. Some other billboards have pictures of the young Gandhi, replacing his ever-smiling mother. 

 And its hard to miss the enormous billboard when you are speeding towards Faizabad, down the Nishatganj flyover. A measly, nonchalant farmer has a sugarcane stalk sticking out of his mouth. The mouth is full and the words that string the header runs: Mulayam meri man ki kwahish (My hearts desires run smooth, with a pun on Mulayam, the smooth one). A self-explanatory offering from Mulayam Singhs Samajwadi Party. 

 The BJP billboards have Vajpayee, and alternately Advani, beaming. Often an enormous hoarding shoots out with provocative caption: Desh bikawa nahin hai (The country is not for sale). The locals believe this to be the fallout of the shooting at Nandigram. The Indian Justice Party has the best message of all: Vote in justice for justice party.

 If this is not entertainment enough, there are other, more earthy forms of merry-making. Most mohallas will have programmes organized by the parties, where the nachaniyas will draw the hooters by dancing to popular Hindi numbers in true filmi style. For the religious-minded, there will be sangkirtans throughout the night, while yajnas are performed for the candidates.

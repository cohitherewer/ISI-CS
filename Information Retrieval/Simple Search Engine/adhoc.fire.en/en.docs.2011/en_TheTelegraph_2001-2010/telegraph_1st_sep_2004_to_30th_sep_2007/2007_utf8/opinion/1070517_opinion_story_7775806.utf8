 Spectre of violence

 Sir Posterity is bound to question the wisdom of officially celebrating the First War of Independence at the cost of the public exchequer. Irrespective of whether this incident was a grand revolt or a spontaneous uprising, Rudrangshu Mukherjee is right in arguing that State celebrations of this violent event goes against the age-old ethos of Indian society (Kill the white man, May 10). What are we celebrating, after all, but the violence that killed thousands? The rebellion was guided more by thoughts of revenge than by reason or any properly thought-out strategy. Certainly, the historical legacy of 1857 is not the most glorious moment in Indias struggle against colonial oppression. By celebrating the mutiny, we are not only setting an ominous precedence for future generations but also flaunting our ignorance of history. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjees article raises important issues that need to be studied from a fresh perspective. Mukherjee has shown persuasively how the element of uncontained violence against the English was crucial to the revolt of 1857. This history of violence should deter Indians from celebrating the event with such pomp and grandeur. The relationship between violence and freedom from political oppression makes one think of another commemoration last year that of Mahatma Gandhis launching of the non-violent movement or satyagraha. But how far was Gandhi, the so-called apostle of non-violence, responsible for freeing India from colonial rule? Has his role in the freedom struggle not been overestimated by historians? There were other political leaders Subhas Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh and Bal Gangadhar Tilak to name a few who did not follow Gandhis recommendations unqualifiedly. They were more inclined towards armed resistance against the colonizers. We choose to celebrate Gandhis satyagraha for showing India the path of truth and non-violence. How can we then eschew that path and seek to cover ourselves with glory for the massacres of 1857? We seem to be blindly trusting the myths perpetuated by historians over the last six decades.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir I concur with Rudrangshu Mukherjee about why we ought to forget 1857 and move on. But as a student of statecraft and military history, I strongly feel that the event requires a more incisive research into the reasons behind its failings. The sepoys had succeeded in securing an extremely important principle of war seizing the initiative at the commencement of the operations. But the action fizzled out altogether as they could not maintain the momentum. Three factors seem to have been behind this failure of leadership, treachery, and poor war-strategies. Historians have mainly concentrated on the sequence of events tabulated by British writers. Perhaps, and notwithstanding William Dalrymple, there are still accounts in Urdu, Devnagari and other local scripts that need to be ferreted out so that a more comprehensive picture of 1857 can emerge.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is not certain to what extent the British historian, Peter Liddle, would be successful in bringing alive a 150-year-old historical event in his guided tour of the Revolt of 1857 (Mutiny guided tour, for Rs 2 lakh, May 14). It all depends on how one perceives a controversial event such as this one. It is easy to dredge up bitter memories of the bloody encounter between Indians and their rulers. But, perhaps, William Dalrymples The Last Mughal could provide a better guide to 1857. This is a work of consummate scholarship, based on numerous facts which were hidden away in archives in various parts of the subcontinent. The narrative neither privileges the patriotic fervour of the Indian soldiers, nor is it informed by an arrogance that could distort perceptions. It can only be hoped that Liddles efforts too are justified by a sense of justice and historical accuracy.

 Yours faithfully,

Probal Ghosh, Calgary, Canada

 Sir Not everyone has been enthusiastic about the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the revolt of 1857. Our non-Hindi-speaking president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, may have valiantly given vent to emotions by attempting to speak in Hindi at the programme organized in Delhi. But the empty seats in the front rows, intended for ministers and parliamentarians, revealed how little such an occasion meant to some people. Also, did the celebrations make a mark on the public imagination?

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Members of parliament have been critcized, time and again, for their poor attendance at parliamentary sessions. Recently, their thin attendance at the commemoration of the Revolt of 1857 at the Red Fort proved again their lack of interest in matters that do not concern them directly. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir As Dipankar Dasgupta points out in Road to efficiency (May 15), the delay in profit, and the consequent lack of incentive, is a major reason behind the inefficiency of state-led projects. But even without State meddling, there could be other problems. For instance, the lack of transparency in the process of issuing tenders despite the matter being handled by private companies. This happens in the other countries too. Take the recent multi-billion pound scandal involving Saudi Arabias purchase of Eurofighter jets. 

 Despite privatization, the State has to employ independent auditors to oversee the bidding process. It should also allow regulators in each industry to function independently. The State cannot absolve itself of its responsibility in infrastructure-building and delivering public services.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Mukherjee, Warwickshire

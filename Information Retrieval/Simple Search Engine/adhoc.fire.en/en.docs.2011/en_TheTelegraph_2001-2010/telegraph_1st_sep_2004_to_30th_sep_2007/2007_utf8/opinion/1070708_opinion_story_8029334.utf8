The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THE SIEGE WITHIN

 It did not need a volley from an anti-aircraft gun to confirm that President Pervez Musharraf had become a soft target for both liberals and radicals in his country. Mr Musharraf seems to be aware of the fact himself. It is proved by the extreme caution with which his governments siege on the Lal Masjid or the Red Mosque in Islamabad was laid. He knew what message would be conveyed to the radical establishment if the mosque were stormed. Which is why despite repeated provocations that came in the form of physical threats and abductions of citizens and foreigners by students in the name of moral policing, the operation was delayed by over six months. When it had to be ordered finally, Mr Musharraf made sure that the bloodshed was kept to a minimum. There were express instructions to the army to hold fire so that militant students could be wooed out. If any blood was spilt, it was because the hardliners inside the mosque, given their dogged intransigence and refusal to surrender unconditionally, had forced his hand. 

 There was another reason for the apparent hardening of the presidents stand. The warrior on terror, in his self-imposed role, could not be seen by the West to be constantly forgetting his lines. He had already given too much concession by failing to act either against the Pakistani taliban training camps in Waziristan and other areas or against the recruitment of insurgents to go on unhindered along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Also, the opposition (namely the secularist Benazir Bhutto), clamouring for an end to the talibanization of Pakistan, had to be kept at bay. So the Lal Masjid, allowed to prosper, sermonize and issue its writs under successive military dictators, had to be cut down to size.

 Mr Musharrafs tempered reaction to the radical challenge is very different from his nervous, hurried response to the pro-democracy movement in summer. The lawyers protests that followed his summary sacking of the countrys chief justice and the subsequent popular agitation in support of the wronged judge were quelled by swift police action and the revival of ethnic divides that plunged the country into a prolonged spate of rioting and violence. Mr Musharraf may have learnt from that episode. But his obvious moderation this time is also prompted by the fact that he finds the radical element in the polity more useful to him than the liberal sections, whose clamour for greater democracy is ill-suited to his plans of wresting the mandate again this November. Mr Musharraf has consistently used minorities like the mohajirs and religious groups to maintain his grip on power. The political stability in the country may have allowed him to rejuvenate its economy, but the dalliance with the clerics is proving to be dangerous, both for him and for the nation. Far from realizing hopes of enlightened moderation, the mullah-military nexus is taking Pakistan deeper and deeper into an abyss. The repeated attempts on his life and the Lal Masjid are only reflections of this undeniable truth. The General can no longer remain blind to it.

 Letters to Editor

 Friendly gesture

 Sir It is commendable that a retired senior politician like Jyoti Basu has come forth to initiate peace in Nandigram. (Bengal bonhomie, June 5). Basu has shown good leadership qualities and proved that political duties do not end with the end of ones political career. Hopefully, his meeting with Mamata Banerjee will help the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamool Congress reach a consensus and hasten the peace process in Nandigram. Basu deserves to be remembered by posterity for this noble gesture.

 Yours faithfully,

Lubna Salim, Calcutta

 Sir Jyoti Basus abrupt invitation to Mamata Banerjee for an informal meeting at his place must have suddenly increased the ladys political credentials. Considering her disruptive politics, she does not deserve such attention, particularly from someone as exalted as Basu. She must have had huge stakes in this exclusive meeting with the senior leader, given her penchant for drawing attention to herself. Calcuttans can now hope that after this chat with Basu, Banerjee will reach some kind of an arrangement with the Left and spare the city from her endless bandhs, protest marches and hunger strikes.

 Yours faithfully,

Sankardas Mukherjee,

 Calcutta

 Sir The invitation to Indira Bhavan displayed Jyoti Basus political acumen. This diplomatic move might help reduce the enmity between the Trinamool Congress and the CPI(M) and herald change in violence-ridden Nandigram. Other parties too should resolve their differences for the sake of public good.

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 Sir Courtesy and rivalry have co-existed in Mamata Banerjee and Jyoti Basus political relationship. Banerjee had a tough time with the left during her tenure as a Congress Union minister. She was sent to lock-up for agitating in the Writers Buildings, Youth Congress workers were killed in police firing, and Basu ridiculed her claims to higher education. However, Banerjee touched Basus feet when she was inducted into P.V. Narasimha Raos cabinet. She even sent roses to Basu when he was ill, and expressed condolences after his wifes death. Basu also sent flowers to Banerjee when she was hospitalized after her fast protesting against farmland acquisition. 

 This time, the two met on agreeable terms. If two seasoned political rivals can change their attitude towards each other over time, we can hope that the worst crisis can also be resolved through dialogue. Basu has made history with his initiative to end the Nandigram impasse despite his advanced age and his retirement from active politics. Credit should also go to Ashok Ghosh for initiating the peace process to which Banerjee responded promptly.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir The impromptu invitation from Jyoti Basu to the Trinamool chief, Mamata Banerjee, for talks once again showed that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is not in command of either his government or the situation in his state.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Sen, Calcutta

 Unfair deals

 Sir Mayavati is understandably happy with the governor of Uttar Pradesh, T.V. Rajeswar, who has withheld permission to the CBI to conduct a probe into the Taj corridor scandal (Governor grants Mayavati immunity, June 6). The decision makes a mockery of Indian democracy as well as the judiciary. The law of the land is not supposed to discriminate among citizens. The chief justice has declared that there is no need to seek sanction in corruption cases.The special privileges granted to Mayavati overrides the law.

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

 Sir The UP governors denial of the sanction to prosecute Mayavati and her cabinet colleague, Nasimuddin Siddiqui, in the Taj corridor case is in itself an evidence of the deep-seated corruption in the Indian polity. There should be judicial review of the governors action by the appropriate court and the CBI enquiry allowed to continue.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Narayan, Chembur 

 Sir The apex court had earlier asked the CBI to complete the investigation and file chargesheets in the Taj corridor case. How is it then that the governor, who is surely not above the apex court, has found that there is no prima facie case against Mayavati? 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir It is not for the UP governor to decide if evidence against Mayavati is insufficient. If she is innocent, she has nothing to fear about appearing in the court. It is also totally absurd that she considers her electoral victory as evidence of the peoples faith in her innocence.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir When Mayavati initiated the arrest of her own BSP MP, Umakant Yadav, in front of her house in Lucknow, she set an example of fairness that is quite rare. The UP governor has now blighted her image.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

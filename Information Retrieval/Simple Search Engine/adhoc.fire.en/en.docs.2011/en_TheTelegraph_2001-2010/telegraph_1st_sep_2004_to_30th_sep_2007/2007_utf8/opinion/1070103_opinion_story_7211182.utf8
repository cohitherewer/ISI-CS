 PROBLEM WITHOUT A NAME

 SOMAK GHOSHAL

 The National Commission for Women feels that the law needs to be amended to reflect the realities of today. But human beings cannot cope quite as well with reality (or at least too much of it) as they do with the rhetoric of welfare. This is betrayed by the NCWs recommendation that adultery should be treated as a civil, and not a criminal, offence because it is an act between consenting individuals, as also a breach of trust between adults. Given the private nature of this offence, the State should not arbitrate in this matter.

 Girija Vyas, chairperson of the NCW, has also opposed the amendment of Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with sexual offences like adultery, because women, she believes, are always victims, however consensual their participation in an adulterous relationship. The logic of her demand had rested on the fact that women are generally in a disempowered position, therefore laws to protect them must be strengthened. Her contention was strongly contested, and the NCW has asked for a national consensus on this issue.

 The practical difficulties of arriving at a national consensus in India are obvious. There is the difficulty of figures, and figures is one area in which India can offer serious competition. With a staggering population spread across diverse geographical, socio-cultural and educational backgrounds, the absurdity of a consensus on womens sexual behaviour is self-evident. The bathos deepens because this is not even a question of womens sexuality in marriage, something that can at least be acknowledged, but one of adultery, an unspeakable, widely condemned transgression. But attitudes to adultery vary immensely, depending on class (both economic and social) and education.

 Justice awaited

 By making women victims by default, Vyas has reinforced the stereotype of women having no agency in or authority over their lives. They might be in a legally disempowered position, but that certainly does not mean they do not want to live out their sexuality. The perpetuation of victimhood entails transferring a burden of self-righteousness onto many who might be perfectly at ease with confronting their desire, or at least be willing to do so. 

 Women might be victims of social injustice but they dont necessarily become victims of their desire. Remember Swapna, the young woman claiming to be the second wife of the Hyderabadi engineer, Kasula Suryanarayana, who was executed by taliban last April? Within hours of Suryanarayanas death, Swapna had visited his bereaved family with a baby girl wailing in her arms (whom she claimed as her child with Suryanarayana). She claimed a portion of the compensation for the child, never denying all along her knowledge of Suryanarayanas first wife or his children from his legal marriage. Suryanarayanas death had put her in a strangely paradoxical situation. While her extra-legal marriage, with nothing but photographs to speak for it, was invalid, the dead man also saved her from being socially ostracized. Despite her repeated admission of being complicit in Suryanarayanas bigamy, the tide of sympathy flowed towards her, the victim of not only one mans false promises but also the entire social justice system. Victimhood was thrust upon Swapna even as she resisted it from the outset. 

 Presently, only the rights of the illegitimate child is protected by Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code. There is no provision for women like Swapna, who are not legally married. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act has redefined domestic relationships to protect not only wives but also women living in relationships in the nature of marriage. The NCWs demand for ensuring alimony for women in live-in relationships can perhaps change the way women like Swapna are forced to face the consequences of their sexuality.

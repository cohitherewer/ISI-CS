 RATHER SUSPECT

 For communists, there never is an end of history or ideology. But the way the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has proposed to espouse the cause of the Muslims can only be described as an end to class struggle. It is a rejection of the ideological basis of a Marxist-Leninist party that can have far-reaching consequences for Indian politics and also for the CPI(M) itself. For a party that has always refused to accept any divisions in society other than the class division, this is almost a tectonic shift. The Marxists seem to have discovered India at last and accepted that religion, caste and other factors are more important to Indian politics than the class division. An indication of this was available at the last congress of the CPI(M) in 2005, when it decided to mobilize the people belonging to tribal and Dalit communities. The campaign for the Muslims is thus in line with the tactics adopted at the party congress. 

 Yet, the partys move on the Muslims smacks of political opportunism of the most blatant kind. Two recent developments seem to have pushed the party to put up a pro-Muslim face. While it mirrors the low socio-economic and educational status of the Muslims in the country, the Sachar committee also blows the lid off the Marxists myth of a Muslim-friendly Bengal. The committees finding that the Muslims lot is the worst in Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh nails many a Left lie. The other event that must have unnerved the CPI(M) is the rise of the Jamait Ulema-i-Hind in Bengal in the wake of the controversy over the acquisition of land for new industries at Nandigram. The challenge of a new political mobilization by the Muslims has even forced the party to shed all pretences and join hands with a predominantly religious organization of the community. That is the measure of the about-turn for a party that swore by Marxs denunciation of religion as the opium of the masses. The CPI(M)s new-found love for the Muslims is thus a matter of political expediency. The challenge in Bengal has given the tactical move an air of urgency.

 The report of the Sachar committee may prompt other parties also to redraw their strategies, especially on the eve of the forthcoming elections in UP. It can have an impact similar to the one that the Mandal Commissions recommendations on caste-based reservations had in the late Eighties. The CPI(M) would surely mount pressure on the United Progressive Alliance government to introduce a sub-plan for the economic development of the Muslims and try to make political capital out of it. But charity, even for a Marxist party, must begin at home. In its 43-year history, the party never had a Muslim or Dalit in its politburo. With credentials such as these, the CPI(M)s minority report must be more than a little suspect.

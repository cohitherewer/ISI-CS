 SICK BED

 There is no point in shying away from the ugly specimen of life revealed at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The Thorat committee, formed to look into allegations of discrimination against students belonging to the reserved categories in the institution, has not come upon a prehistoric monster. Caste, thanks to all (particularly a range of people dressed in white), is alive and well in India. Since the corridors of AIIMS are an extension of the society from which the institution draws its doctors and patients, the predominant notions of caste, gender and community continue to inform, bolster and incapacitate human interactions. If the committee members have been alarmed by the aggressive functioning of caste within the premises and within an enlightened academic community, it is because the social imbalance has been magnified many times over by the strange circumstances that persist in this institution. The passion with which lower caste students are driven out of classrooms, dining rooms and playgrounds or ghettoized in their hostels has been cultivated to serve the ends of politics by those who have a vested interest in keeping social equations as fractured as possible within the confines of the institution. It is their tool to fight the perceived injustice of centralized control. For the students, the majority of whom belong to the general category, it is their own selfish way of fighting for their time-tested privileges, which the reservation policy has been steadily eating into. It is the convergence of interests that made AIIMS the storm centre during the anti-reservation protests last year.

 The discrimination against students who belong to the reserved categories is heinous. Even if the failed lower caste students in AIIMS are given their degrees or welcomed back to dining rooms, there is no guarantee that this sordid pattern will not replicate itself in any other institution in India. There will always be narrow interests to protect. The goings-on in AIIMs are just a reflection of how diligently the politicization of caste and the skewed science of social justice in India are setting the clock back. Instead of removing disparities and inequities in Indian society, the reservation policy, especially its politically-motivated use, is creating new rifts and deeper divides. Perhaps it is time to heed the Supreme Courts advice, and rethink the policy of positive discrimination along more constructive lines.

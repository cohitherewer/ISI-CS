 NAMELESS IMAGES

 Aveek Sen

 Visual Arts 

 Changing Images (Chitrakoot Gallery, until March 31) exhibits works by artists teaching in the faculty of visual arts at Rabindra Bharati University. A show that describes itself as a calendrical event meant to inspire students should be more substantial, better curated, and the exhibits should have been properly captioned. Most of the works are skilled, but tend to be easy on the eye, making the show look like a rather well-decorated drawing room.

 Sreyashi Chatterjees pair of drawings are beautifully intricate, but may appear slight outside the context of her larger works. Parag Roys grotesque animals with pencil stubs and cigarette butts gently shock, but then become predictable. Dolanchanpa Gangulys paper collages are arresting, especially the one of the tree with the goats. But the shadow of Shakila falls on her work. Nikhil Ranjan Pals drawing, Natorer Banalata Sen (picture) is pretty, but a tad too Bikashian. Anindya Pandits series in mixed media with letters and numbers marks an original departure in visual language, especially the larger Aaya na balama, with its mysterious, tensely waiting figures. 

 The whole show is like a pleasant English drizzle nice and easy at first, but one longs to get properly drenched after a while.

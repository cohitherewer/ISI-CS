 Letters to Editor

 Small favour

 Sir The case Rudrangshu Mukherjee makes for granting autonomy to Presidency College is not convincing (Why autonomy?, July 22). To begin with, frenetic efforts to get the college an exclusive status are decidedly in bad taste. Falling standards in Presidency is a reflection of the overall decline in educational standards in the state. It is not clear how the workload of Calcutta University could contribute to Presidencys downfall. However, the other reason that Mukherjee cites, namely, political interference, is surely an important factor. But this factor is also at play in other colleges affiliated to the Calcutta University. Why single out Presidency for the rescue act? Certainly, the fate of other colleges also matters. As a former student of English literature who spent five years earning his bachelors and masters degrees at Calcutta university, I can testify to the fact that the best teachers and students I came in contact with were not exclusively from Presidency. 

 I mention this because there is a need to improve the other colleges to ensure that students get quality education, irrespective of where they study. Instead of singling out just one college, a cluster of, say, five to seven colleges could be formed to nurture and promote academic excellence. This would be beneficial for students who are often required to seek admission in colleges other than Presidency owing to the limited number of seats Presidency has to offer in any discipline. 

 As for the burden of the affiliated colleges on Calcutta University, it could be lessened if the state government arranged for other state universities to assume responsibility for an average of ten colleges each. In any case, political interference has to stop if Bengal is to achieve excellence in higher education. Merit alone should decide who gets to teach and who gets to be taught. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjee makes obvious that political reasons stand in the way of granting autonomy to Presidency College even after 35 years of the publication of Dipak Banerjees treatise on the matter. The initiatives suggested by the seven-member committee to improve the situation in Presidency are weak. There are many instances where institutions of excellence have been granted autonomy for sustaining high standards of education. Most of these institutions have lived up to expectations. Ravenshaw College in Cuttack is a good example. In India, and more so in Bengal, higher education remains a domain of political interference. Decentralization of the Calcutta University is a necessity. Presidency should also get autonomy, at least on a trial-basis for a decade.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir The present generation of students in Presidency College does not relate to the college or value it the way we used to. As a former student (1939 to 1941), I remember Prafulla Ghosh, whose tenure was extended by six months as no one was found suitable to replace him. Students from other colleges used to attend his lectures on Shakespeare. There were other giants like Tarak Sen, Srikumar Bandopadhyay and Subodh Sen Gupta. The history department had Susobhan Sarkar, philosophy had Mahendra Nath Sarkar, Sanskrit G.N. Shastri, physics P.C. Mahalanobis and chemistry Khudrat-e-Khode. 

 The charge of elitism against the college is a red herring. In our time, there were a few students from the Paikpara rajbari and some whose fathers were barristers and advocates. But most, like me, came from an ordinary middle-class background. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.M. Das, Calcutta

 Sir Today, if a student were given a choice to study either in St Xaviers College and Presidency, he is likely to choose the former. The choice of subjects on offer in St Xaviers is more varied than in Presidency. But that is not the only reason. Presidency is way past its prime. Much of its decline is owing to politicization of education. This, in turn, is the handiwork of the Marxists who still dream of controlling every aspect of public life, beginning with ideas.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das Sharma, Calcutta

 Sir Presidency College is the most pampered institution under Calcutta University. Its departments enjoy privileges that are only a pipe dream for other colleges. Suffice it to say that even without the autonomous tag, Presidency would retain its elitist credentials, although its use of financial support from the state has ensured that the college remains accessible to meritorious students from poorer backgrounds. Granting more financial benefits to the college would merely prolong the status quo. Also, much has been made of St Xaviers Colleges autonomy. St Xaviers has largely been an elitist institution for students from affluent backgrounds. Only time will tell if distancing St Xaviers from Calcutta University has done anything to improve its academic standards.

 Yours faithfully,

Amitava Ray, New York

 SMALL PRICE

 Compulsory registration of marriage is one of those feel-good myths that sporadically find place on the agenda of the administration. Womens rights activists and lawyers have repeatedly recommended that registration be made compulsory. If properly implemented, it would help reduce many forms of exploitation and cruelty minor marriage and bigamy being two examples. Or at least, such is the hope. So it is politically correct to express, from time to time, intentions to reform the laws associated with marriage. This time, West Bengals law department appears to have done so, following the directions given by the Supreme Court to the Centre last year. All marriages have to be registered, failing which the parties would have to pay a fine. The court had also directed the state governments to reform their marriage laws in accordance with the changes made by the Centre. But nobody is really in a hurry about these things. West Bengal may have made its changes, but the Centre has apparently not done so. So, conveniently enough, the law department does not know whether the reformed laws can be applied even after the cabinets approval if the Centre does not act soon.

 There is an understandable reluctance among all governments regarding registration. Anything that might touch on religious customs is a deterrent to governments eager to appease vote banks. In the new law about marriage registration, the state law department has proposed a Rs 25 fine as penalty for breaking it. The economics tells the story. Where the cost of registering a marriage is Rs 400 and of not registering it is Rs 25, the outcome need not be left to speculation. There has been some talk of reducing the fee, which is required in marriages under the Hindu Marriage Act and the Special Marriage Act. Should not there be a standard, affordable registration fee across the board, especially since it has been proposed that below-the-poverty-line couples can register without a fee? And whatever the reason for the absurdly low penalty, it should be changed to make it pinch. Implementation comes after that.

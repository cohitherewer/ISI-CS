 The way of delayed justice

 Sir The report, Sacked soldier calls judges donkeys in Delhi court (July 27), is an index of the length of judicial procedures in India. It must have been the sheer frustration of appearing in court for nearly a decade that made the jawan lose his cool and called the judges names. Justice delayed is justice denied is a proverb which holds little meaning for the Indian justice system. The government must amend the relevant laws and ensure that cases are decided within a year. Else, the judiciary and its officers are going to descend further in the eyes of the public. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Caught napping

 Sir Origin of the Kolkata Police, a book written by P. Thankappan Nair, was recently launched during the inauguration of a police museum. In his book, Nair writes that minutes from a meeting, dated September 8, 1929, attended by Lord William Bentinck, indicated the creation of the post of the police commissioner in Calcutta. Significantly, the minutes also included the following statement The great inefficiency of the Police of this large City is the subject of universal remark. It seems that things have not changed a lot since the days of the raj. Even today, there are complaints about police apathy, inefficiency and corruption in Calcutta. Murders, dacoity, road accidents, eve-teasing and other crimes take place every day in this oasis of peace. Unfortunately, on most occasions, the police prefer to look the other way. Worse, to lodge a complaint, citizens often have to run from pillar to post, thanks to the lack of cooperation and rude behaviour from the police. 

 The chief minister who lords over this oasis is indifferent to the citizens plight as well. Instead of asking the police commissioner to rid the city of crime, he directed his loyal minion to contest the post of president of the CAB. The commissioner won, on the second attempt. But if Calcuttas police commissioner keeps himself busy in managing the affairs of a sporting body, then who is going to look after the safety of citizens? In the past, the Cricket Association of Bengal had been run by sports administrators, and not by a police commissioner. It is shocking to note that the police commissioner can be spared for work that has nothing to do with maintaining law and order in the city. Does the Indian Police Service rules permit such extra-curricular activities? Or is this just another proof of Calcuttas colonial heritage?

 Yours faithfully,

Susanta Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir Just a few days back, The Telegraph had published the news of a model being molested and her male escort assaulted on a Calcutta street. A British tourist couple was assaulted a few days later. In the second incident, the police were unwilling to file a complaint at first. At the time of the attack on the model, the people of Calcutta were blamed for not coming forward to help the woman. The real reason behind the peoples unwillingness to and help the victim was their fear of harassment from the police. It is well-known that criminals enjoy political patronage which helps them to manipulate the police. This has forced citizens to believe that when it comes to confronting hoodlums, discretion is the better part of valour. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

 Sir The other day, I saw a boy crashing his vehicle into two cars. Fortunately, no one was hurt on this occasion. The police caught the culprit but released him quickly. It is a pity that the cops consider drunken driving as a mild offence. The police should run frequent breath-analysing tests and take serious action against the perpetrators. Only that can deter culprits from driving in an inebriated state. 

 Yours faithfully,

Panchali Singh Anand, Calcutta

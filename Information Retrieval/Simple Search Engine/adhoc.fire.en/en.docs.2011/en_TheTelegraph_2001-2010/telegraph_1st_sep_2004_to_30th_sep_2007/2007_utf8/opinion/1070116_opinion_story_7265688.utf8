 BUILDING PEACE AND KEEPING IT

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the report of the UN secretary-general, August, 2006

 Over the past year I have been grateful to the Security Council for strengthening the mandates of our missions in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Haiti and for permitting the transfer of personnel from Liberia to Cte dIvoire and from Burundi to the Democratic Republic of the Congo....Fulfilling complex mandates requires the highest-calibre civilian staff, drawn from across the United Nations system, other multilateral organizations and Member States. This year, we made important progress in approving and staffing the initial operating capability for a standing police capacity. We must continue to work to get the best professionals, civilian and uniformed, in the field on the shortest...notice.

 But building peace takes not only strong personnel but time....While the concerns of the Organizations financial and personnel contributors must always be taken into account, it is important that the international community does not withdraw too hastily from conflict-scarred countries. I am hopeful that the new Peacebuilding Commission...will play an important role in coordinating the rebuilding of post-conflict societies.

 We also need strong partners....I welcome the European Unions decision to provide a standby force to support the United Nations Operation in the Congo during national elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and am grateful to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for their continued collaboration in ensuring stability and political progress in Kosovo....The United Nations has made marked progress in cooperating with the African Union, as demonstrated by the joint United Nations-African Union assessment mission to Darfur, Sudan, in June. This allowed the two organizations to develop a consolidated plan for strengthening the current African Union Mission in the Sudan and to provide recommendations for the transfer from that mission to a United Nations peacekeeping operation in the region.

 Yet we must also recognize that...the government of the Sudan has yet to approve a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Darfur. Alongside the constraints placed on the operations of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea by the government of Eritrea and the request of the government of Burundi that the United Nations Operation in Burundi withdraw, this is a potent reminder that we can build peace and stability only where there is sustained local political support and raises very hard questions about why we sometimes fail to win that support from parties when we need it most....The parties to a conflict may not always perceive an effective peacekeeping operation as being in their interest. There are also...misperceptions about the agenda of our peacekeeping operations. However, once the parties have recognized that United Nations peacekeeping has no other goal than that of promoting international peace and security, we must ensure that our peacekeepers meet the highest standards and that the necessary resources are made available.

 We have recognized that we sometimes lose local support because of our operational failings, most obviously in the case of sexual exploitation and abuse, which we have worked hard to eradicate in recent years.... We lose credibility when we lack the full range of resources necessary to add- ress multiple challenges ....Too often, our stature is eroded by disenchantment with the often slow processes of development or institution-building. Our own morale also suffers badly in these circumstances.

 But we must understand...that the deployment of peacekeepers, under direct United Nations command or otherwise, will bring real peace only where the international community maintains close involvement in finding political solutions with local actors and in creating conditions for effective reconstruction and development. At a time when our peacekeeping forces are so overextended, and often taking significant risks, it must be remembered that their presence can ease dialogue and succeed only where there is political will....

 As we...continue to search for a settlement to the great crises of our time, such as those in the Middle East and the Sudan, it is crucial that we continue to muster the political will that can translate our investment of financial and human resources into peace.

 In the course of the past decade...more focus...has been devoted to post-conflict peacebuilding that is, in the aftermath of conflict, the restoration of State authority, the revitalization of State-society relations and of civil society and the reconstruction of the institutional foundations of economic and social development.

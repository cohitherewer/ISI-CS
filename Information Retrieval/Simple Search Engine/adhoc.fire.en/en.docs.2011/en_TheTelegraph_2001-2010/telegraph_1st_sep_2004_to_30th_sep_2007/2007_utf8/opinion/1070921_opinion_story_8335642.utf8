 THE STORY INSIDE

 In a new light

 Interpreting homes in South Asian literature Edited by Malashri Lal and Sukrita Paul Kumar, Pearson, Rs 560

 Homes are not empty spaces. The relations of gender, caste and class that frame the home enter it like invisible spirits and condition the psychological, emotional and social expectations as well as responses of the inhabitants. This quote, from one of the essays in the book under review, looks at home in a particular way. While turning these pages, the reader would come to know of the many changes in the interpretation of the term, home, that have come about in postcolonial societies as more and more people travel to distant places in search of better career prospects or for other reasons.

 The eighteen essays in the book have been classified into six sections: Partition: Questioning Borders, Home as Social Text, Language: Writing the Difference, Gender, Family/Memory, and Identity and Nation. The first section is an important marker and the three essays in it look at the way in which the term has been interpreted in literary texts. An interesting point raised by Anjali Gera in her essay concerns the role of food vis--vis the refugee. The nostalgic dimension of food is reflected in the following excerpt written by Gera The refugee suffers a displacement from traditional food...being uprooted from its geography as well as history. Gera also mentions certain other factors such as the retention of local cuisine and the maintenance of local taboos about the preservation and storage of food in the face of altered geographies and histories. Those in exile go through similar experiences as well, trying to connect with home through food. 

 The second section deals with the diasporas attempts to negotiate between the country of adoption and the country of origin. Whether the children of first-generation immigrants, born in the country of adoption, severe ties with the mother country or not depends on numerous variables. The position they take determines the location of their homes, whether real or imagined. A question likely to occur at this juncture is that why does English still hold the pride of place in a social set up and literary world marked by so many languages? Mridula Nath Chakraborty answers this question by referring to the prevalent colonial hangover in India. Even Jawaharlal Nehrus famous tryst with destiny speech that ushered in Independence was composed in English.

 A feminist perception that problematizes home as the site of womens oppression as against romanticized notions of it being a site offering protection has been taken up in the section subtitled Gender. The impact of such adverse conditions has been discussed in the following section, titled Family/Memory. Rosinka Chaudhuris essay traces the transformation in the material manifestations of home, which came about as a result of colonial contact. The concluding section comprises presentations on the theme, Identity and Nation. Of the essays in this section, Muneeza Shamsies paper is an eye opener as it reveals startling similarities and differences between the Indian and Pakistani perspectives.

 The essays in this book dwell on the major shifts in the conceptualization of home. The term has been stripped of associated notions such as safety and comfort. Home, according to the contributors, is primarily a patriarchal structure that fuels a degree of uncertainty, which is reflected in the modern subcontinental psyche.

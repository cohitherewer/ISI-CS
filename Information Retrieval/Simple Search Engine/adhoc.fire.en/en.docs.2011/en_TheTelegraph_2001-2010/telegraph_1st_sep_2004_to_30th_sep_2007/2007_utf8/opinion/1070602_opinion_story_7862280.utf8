 Letters to Editor

 Young and responsible

 Sir I am 59 years old, but I fully support Malvika Singhs views in Old is not gold (May 25). Why are all our political and governmental institutions filled with old (and senile, infirm and compromised) people? Youngsters today are not an ignorant lot, they are more capable than ever before, and should be given greater responsibilities. One should not have to witness a repeat of the case of Dayanidhi Maran, a young and able leader who had to bow to the whims of an old and weak man. We should have political parties composed exclusively of young, aspiring, intelligent and fearless people. No man above 50 should be allowed to retain a political post. Needless to say, the progress of our country will go up by leaps and bounds.

 Yours faithfully,

 Arun Kumar Agarwal, Calcutta

 Mountain morals

 Sir The editorial, Upon that mountain (May 27), raises fundamental questions about morality and ethics in the so-called death-zone on the higher reaches of Everest. It is difficult to accept the generalized conclusion that radically different codes of behaviour can be accepted and even condoned at those high altitudes, where survival itself is a struggle. The contrast between the rescue of Usha Bista this year and the death of David Sharp last year is a telling one. Sharp was reportedly left to die on the Everest by no less than 40 persons who passed him by, both on their way up as well as down. Rescue has better chances of success by climbers on their way up, as they are fresher and better equipped to help. 

 The dilemma is that helping out at those heights nearly always entails giving up ones own chances to summit. There have been rescues even on the comparatively difficult north face, as in the case of Lincoln Hall last year, where the rescuers had to abandon their own mission. The ethical questions are: is the summit too big a prize to forego in attempting to save a fellow climbers life? And can one summit, leaving a colleague to die and live with that for the rest of his life? Each case throws up different circumstances, which shape the ethics of the players. Many believe that Kevin Carter, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his photograph of a starving girl in Sudan and a stalking vulture, took his life because he could not live with the fact that he had walked away without trying to save the girl. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Singh, Doha

 Sir Everest and ethics (May 27) did not mention the late Major Harsh Vardhan Bahuguna, who was left to die near the summit during an international expedition to Eve- rest in 1970. He was the only Indian mountaineer in that team. A subsequent inquiry found that a German climber of this team, who could have saved him, opted to abandon him instead. It was after this incident that the government passed an order that, in future, every Indian component of such an expedition must have at least two climbers who will act as buddies, specifically to ensure that a similar tragedy does not occur again. Sadly, Bahugunas younger brother Jai also a strapping young army officer who wanted to complete his brothers dream of peaking Everest, expired short of achieving his target while on an Indian army expedition.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The comment by the Citu president, M.K. Pandhe, that Medha (Patkar) and others who run foreign-funded NGOs are opposed to development, is almost childish (Citu backs CMs chemical hub plan, May 30). Are only the foreign-funded NGOs opposed to forcible acquisition of farmlands? If foreign funds are welcome for industry in West Bengal, then why should NGOs be vilified for accepting such funds? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LIMITED HAND 

 It took Mr Rajnath Singh, the Bharatiya Janata Party president, nearly 13 months after his initial appointment to make a decision about his team. When he finally did, after carefully avoiding various inauspicious phases of the stars and planets, he exposed himself as a politician of extraordinary limitations. The office-bearers and members of the BJPs top decision-making bodies are, of course, reflective of the various pulls and pressures that define the party. Nominees of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh are, for example, by convention accommodated in the all-important post of organizing secretary. At the same time, the BJP constitution allows generous elbow room to the party president to leave his signature on the group that should, ideally, function as the opposition shadow cabinet. Tragically for the BJP, Mr Singhs choice of the team to lead the BJP and, by implication, the National Democratic Alliance, into battle against the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, is not an accurate reflection of the talent available to the party. On the contrary, it is a mirror to the personal angularities and narrow mindset of the man chosen by the RSS to succeed Mr L.K. Advani and bring stability to a disoriented party. Mr Singh is a product of the disagreeable politics of Uttar Pradesh and, despite being catapulted to the all-India stage, has not been able to rise above it. He has shown himself to be only at ease with either faceless apparatchiks or those permanently beholden for having been raised to positions well above their station.

 Interest in the BJP presidents team-building has naturally focussed on the exclusion of the Gujarat chief minister, Mr Narendra Modi, from the apex parliamentary board and the attempted marginalization of the general secretary, Mr Arun Jaitley. Mr Modi is unquestionably a controversial politician who invokes extreme reactions. He is, however, the BJPs most successful chief minister and the darling of the party faithfuls. Likewise Mr Jaitley, apart from being an articulate exponent of the BJP, has proved an excellent election manager. Along with Ms Sushma Swaraj, Messers Modi and Jaitley are the brightest stars of the BJPs second generation. They combine their unquestioned loyalty to the party with fiercely independent views, which they are not afraid to air. 

 By signalling his unease with them and devaluing their importance in party committees, Mr Singh has not succeeded in undermining them. He has merely revealed his profound personal insecurities, his innate suspicion of talent and his natural penchant for mediocrities. Having been appointed as an interim head to steady the ship before the real successor to Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mr Advani is identified, Mr Singh has now convinced himself as he admitted in Lucknow during the national council session that he is the designated bridegroom. So far he has done nothing, either by way of direction or mass mobilization, to justify his astounding faith in himself. Now, by overplaying his limited hand, he may trigger speculation over what he is doing occupying the presidents chair in the first place.

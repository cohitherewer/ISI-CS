The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 In the olden days, princes often fought wars of succession. Leaders in the Bharatiya Janata Party, inspired by such royal antics, are now battling one another to decide on Ataljis successor. Yashwant Sinha recently declared on TV that the race for the partys prime ministerial candidate was still open. Murli Manohar Joshi chipped in too, with his own take on LK Advanis claim to the post, while Rajnath Singhs supporters pressed the gen-secs case in earnest. At the national executive meet in Bhopal, a chirpy senior party member even stated that the Indian cricket team had done well in the Twenty20 World Cup in the absence of senior players. If Team India could do it, so can the BJP. But Vajpayee, it is clear, is not thinking about sanyas just yet. He may not have made it to Bhopal because of ill health, but, Terminator like, he sent a note declaring that he would be back soon. One wonders whether that will be enough to silence the chatter about succession though.

 Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy has been going through a rough patch. First came the tragic bomb blasts in Hyderabad. Then a flyover collapsed in the capital. This was followed by the news that the son of the state party secretary, Keshav Rao, was involved in a murder. A desperate YSR sought counsel from the AICC gen-sec, Digvijay Singh, in charge of Andhra. Singh, characteristically, found fault with the stars and advised YSR to organize a yajna. He also asked him to find a suitable brahmin who could perform the ritual. YSR, who has a dim view of such things, then enquired whether he could use the services of the newly-appointed governor, Narain Dutt Tiwari. On hearing this, Singh had a hearty laugh and reportedly told the CM that Dutt, though a reputable brahmin, specialized only in material, rather than spiritual, affairs.

 Visiting dignitaries invariably greet ministers with expensive bouquets. So, the other day, when Manpreet Badal, the finance minister of Punjab, came calling on Murli Deora, the petroleum minister, Deora must have expected another bunch of roses and gladioli. What he got instead was a book, and a Pulitzer winning one at that; Daniel Yergins The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money amp; Power. This 900-page tome delves into the origin of oil, its impact on the world economy as well as other topics such as politics and ecology. Badal, a product of the Ivy league, told Deora that despite his onerous ministerial responsibilities, he had kept up with his reading habits and often spent time browsing through titles in book shops. Deora must have been mightily pleased with the gift. As the petroleum minister, he needed to have facts on his finger tips. The book would tell him all he needed to know about oil. Not just that, Badals present must have also saved him the trouble of watering yet another flower pot in his chamber.

 Senior officials in the information and broadcasting ministry were in a tizzy when the president, Pratibha Patil, came to present the national film awards at Vigyan Bhavan recently. They had expected a member of the jury, opposed to Amitabh Bachchans nomination for the best actor award, to create a scene. Not wanting a repetition of last years performance when some guests stood up on their seats and shouted slogans against the ministry, the men took up positions to quell the first signs of trouble. In the end, trouble came, but from unexpected quarters. Three filmmakers, while receiving their awards, quietly handed over a petition to Patil, protesting the unhelpful ways of the ministry as its alert officials kept an eye on their quarry.

 India, at 60, is a generous country. Or so thought Vayalar Ravi. In an unprecedented gesture, the minister for NRIs asked a planeload of scribes to be flown to the US for four weeks so that they could talk about the countrys achievements. Those who had failed to make the cut were not pleased, naturally. And soon, there were angry whispers that the passenger list included quite a few guests from the ministers home state, Kerala. Poor Ravi! He must now be convinced that the more things change, the more they remain the same.

 When in trouble, turn to books. Thats exactly what Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is doing reading everything he can on the N-subject. Helping him is his Presidency College mate, Bikash Sinha, director of the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics. Can the Bengal CM gather enough information to turn the Left right?

 FOOTNOTE

 A good turn in politics seldom counts. Ambika Soni had once played saviour to Jairam Ramesh. The same man is now demanding her resignation after the Ram setu controversy befell the Congress. Seven years ago, Ramesh, had, in an interview, stated, people who saw her [Sonia] as a ticket to nirvana now see her as a ticket to narak. He had also predicted that the Congress would not come back to power for another 50 years, if things stood as they were. Soon enough, word got around and there were attempts to throw Ramesh out of the party. In desperation, he turned to fellow economist, Manmohan Singh, who declined to help. In this dark hour, Soni came to Rameshs rescue, taking him to 10 Janpath where he explained to Madam how he had been quoted out of context. In circa 2007, there has been a reversal of fortunes. Soni now finds herself pushed to a corner, but Ramesh has decided to return favours in a very different manner.

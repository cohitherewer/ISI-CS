 LIFE BEFORE THE WICKET

 DEAD BALL

 A random selection of cases of death and violence where cricket played the catalyst

 Whatever Bill Shankly may have thought, football, or any other sport for that matter, is not more important than life and death. In fact, a sport, by definition, should not even be a matter of life and death. But who would explain this to the hundreds of Indians who have killed, themselves or others, over a cricket match? 

 There is a whole body of jokes about marital discord, even violence, arising out of football and cricket matches, rugby games and so on. But all traces of homour turn jet black or disappear when a man decides to hang himself after a tiff with his wife over the watching of a cricket match on TV. In Bajitpur in West Bengal, a 25-year-old farmer, Mahadeb Sarkar, and his wife, Sadhana, had a fight because Mahadeb wanted to go and watch an India-Sri Lanka match at his neighbours house. Sadhana wanted him to watch the game with her at home. 

 Mahadeb went ahead with his plan, and then, India lost the match. Upset with both the match result and the argument with his wife, Mahadeb came back home and promptly hanged himself. Sadhana tried the same, but her rope snapped.

 After the same match, another young man had a heart attack and died in a suburb of Hyderabad.

 These were in 1999. More recently, after Indias loss to Bangladesh and the resultant inglorious exit from the World Cup, a seventeen-year-old boy died of a heart attack. Another shaved off his head. 

 In Pune in March this year, an eight-year-old boy, Abhijit Hinge, died after a boy from his own team allegedly hit him on the head with a bat. According to police reports, Abhijit had failed to stop a ball while fielding. The ball disappeared. This led to a quarrel. Abhijit spent some time looking for the lost ball, but failed to recover it. When he returned empty-handed, he was hit on the head by the bowler, which eventually led to the death. Incidentally, the dead boys parents work as labourers. 

 In an article aptly titled, Is it safe to play cricket in India? in the website, www.countercurrents.org, Raja Swamy narrates the following incidents:

 On December 21st, 2003, two Dalit youths in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh were murdered by Rajputs in the village. PUCL concludes that the main cause seems to be the defeat in successive cricket matches that was considered an insult to Rajputs who considered themselves invincible, and the least to be beaten by the subjugated and good for nothing Dalits. The village pradhan is suspected of being involved in these murders, and the local police are suspected of being complicit in obscuring the investigation by failing to act against the real culprits and tampering with the FIR. For Dalits who dare to use cricket as a way to achieve empowerment, these are the responses of dominant caste elites and their institutionally entrenched cohorts. Would Vikas Singh and Vikram Singh, a brickworker and a carpenter, whose lives were cut short by these vile men, have opinions on whether India and Pakistan should play? 

 In the same article, Swamy talks of another gruesome instance of cricket equipment becoming the agents of violence, as had happened with Mohammed Imran in April 2007 in Calcutta. When Lingaraj Azad, an adivasi leader in Orissa was arrested in April 2003, at least 250 people, including women and children, peacefully walked towards the police station to demand an explanation. Before they could reach, a mob of about a hundred men armed with cricket bats and stumps badly beat them up. The mob was apparently sent by the owners of Sterlite, who had recently taken over state-owned BALCO, and had plans to take away lands from the tribals. Lingaraj later said that he had overheard the officer-in-charge at the police station telephoning instructions to pro-Sterlite youth club members to beat up men and women with cricket bats and stumps. 

 Life and death, like other things, are all in the game.

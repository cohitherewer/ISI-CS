The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DO NOT RUSH

 Rushing in where the wiser fear to tread is, in most cases, regarded as the opposite of wisdom. This kind of wise caution is what the Supreme Court now expects the Centre to exercise in the case of reserving 27 per cent of seats in elite educational institutions for the other backward classes. The apex court has rightly urged the Centre to clarify and review the latters fundamental claims and assumptions regarding the OBCs. Who constitute the OBCs, how do they live now in terms of economic and educational parameters, and what are their numbers now? The answers to these questions are far from clear to the judiciary and to the various organizations that filed petitions seeking a stay on the Central Educational Institutions (Reservations in Admission) Act, 2006. To the court, what is perhaps most dubious is the creation of such an upheaval in the countrys higher education system being founded on data gathered in a census done in 1931. The Centre, therefore, needs to base its stand on the issue on a far more up-to-date and methodologically sound reappraisal of the whole situation, and this cannot be done in a great hurry.

 Yet, a hurry is precisely what the Centre seems to be in, and the reasons are perhaps not entirely inscrutable. With the Uttar Pradesh elections coming up, the OBC vote-bank becomes an important factor. But apart from the basics of the situation, the modalities of how exactly institutions of excellence are going to transform themselves into reservationist institutions, without seriously upsetting their academic standards and organizational equilibrium, have to be worked out properly without being rushed into blunders. What is to be done, for instance, with the creamy layer within the OBCs an area that the act does not clarify. The court has also made it clear that it was not seeking the setting aside of the act, but a deferment of its implementation. Nor does this mean that the court would be laying down the parameters by which the Centre is to revaluate the socio-economic status of the OBCs. Thus the question of time seems to have been made crucial for the sake of both understanding clearly the actual situation and determining how to deal with it legally and constitutionally. To go ahead with an entirely new, and potentially chaotic and divisive, admissions system without properly knowing about and thinking through all these elements would be very unwise indeed.

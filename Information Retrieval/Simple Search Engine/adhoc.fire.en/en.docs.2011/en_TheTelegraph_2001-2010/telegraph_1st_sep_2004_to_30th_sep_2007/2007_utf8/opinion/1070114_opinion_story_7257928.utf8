The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 UNFAIR ON ENVIRONMENT

 The high court of Calcutta, for all practical purposes, has put an end to the Calcutta Book Fair being held on the Maidan. Many Bengalis will be disappointed by this ruling. For them it will mean one less fair in the winter season, one less place to go to and one less place to be seen at. The Calcutta Book Fair has been praised as a cultural event unique to Calcutta, and its popularity is taken as an index of Calcuttas love for books. This pride is totally misplaced. There are also people who compare the Calcutta Book Fair to the one in Frankfurt. This is like comparing oranges to bananas. The book fair in Frankfurt is a trade fair where rights of books, rather than books, are bought and sold. The Calcutta Book Fair is a retail fair. In other words, under the auspices of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, bookshops and publishing houses sell their books at heavily subsidized ground rent. It is also important to remember that books are not the only commodities sold in the book fair in Calcutta. Food and drink stalls abound. Nor is it true that only book lovers and book buyers visit the fair. The Calcutta Book Fair has become a part of Calcuttas winter social calendar. It is visited by a number of people who are not even remotely connected with books. For them, the book fair is a carnival. For years on end, this fair, where money is made by booksellers and publishers, has devastated a large part of the Maidan, an area that is environmentally critical to the city.

 There has been a very belated recognition of the damage the book fair does to the Maidan and therefore to the environment. The people of Calcutta and book fair enthusiasts need to be made aware of this damage. This is too high a social cost to pay for subsidizing a group of people who come here for the purposes of making profit. The subsidy comes in many forms. There is the direct and indirect support the fair receives from the West Bengal government. There is also the fact that booksellers in the fair pay a pittance as rent to the guild that organizes the fair on land which it does not own. The entire process is full of anomalies and bereft of any economic logic. It will not be an exaggeration to say that the Calcutta Book Fair performs no social function. There is no evidence to suggest that it has encouraged reading. It may not even have promoted the habit of book buying. The large majority of people who buy books at the fair do not buy books during the rest of the year. In fact, if there had existed a pervasive habit of reading and book buying, it would not have been necessary for booksellers and publishers to throng to a fair to display their ware.

 The Calcutta Book Fair has acquired a larger-than-life importance because of the involvement of the state government and the overt support it receives from the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. It is significant that immediately after the high court gave its ruling on Friday, the organizers of the book fair rushed to have a meeting with the chief minister. This involvement is unfortunate. The state government has or should have more important things on its plate than helping the Publishers and Booksellers Guild despoil the Maidan.

 Loss of focus

 Sir It is perhaps time the Indian selectors started thinking of selecting two separate teams for one-day matches and test cricket (Proteas pack a fatal punch, Dec 31). It is quite evident that Indian cricketers lack the most critical attribute required for test cricket patience. Too much of one-day cricket has made them lose their focus. They cannot last on the pitch for long hours. The lack of focus was obvious in Indias second innings against South Africa in the Durban test. The Indian team, henceforth, will be under more pressure to perform. Incidentally, Andre Nel seems to be getting away with his sledging and verbal ballast. Are match referees predisposed to take action only when it concerns free-wheeling cricketers from the subcontinent?

 Yours faithfully,

N.G. Gokarn, Mumbai 

 Sir Since fortune favours the brave, there can be no questions about why it left the side of the Indian cricket team in Durban. Instead of preparing themselves for all adversities, the Indians relied on poor light and the rain to rescue them. There wasnt too much solace to be found, however. So the Indian batsmen came to the pitch and left at the earliest opportunity, as if responding to an attendance call. The Indian team seems to have forgotten that test cricket is not only about winning, but also about surviving and saving a match. Although India won the Johannesburg test, in both innings of the first and the second matches, they failed to score even 250. Batting is definitely a cause of concern for India. Despite the series being evenly poised, the South Africans will be difficult to beat in the final test. The Indian teams high spirits may have disappeared after the Durban defeat. But it could still make an attempt to win the series.

 Yours faithfully,

P.S. Chatterjee, Andul

 Sir Cricketers and politicians in India are birds of the same feather. Neither have any accountability or a sense of responsibility. For both, performance is not linked to pay and they waste tax-payers money. Moreover, they also earn more from avenues which are not, strictly speaking, part of their respective professions. Typically, the ageing politician and the failing cricketer refuse to quit. A politician now heads the Board of Control for Cricket in India and politics continues to determine the selection of the Indian team. The system, both in politics and cricket, is corrupt to the core. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Vasudeva R., Bangalore

 Sir The cricket fan in India will soon tire of the fluctuating patterns of victory and defeat that characterize the performance of the Indian cricket team. A supporter of Team India cannot hope to savour the taste of victory for long defeats seem to have become the norm for the team. The sequence of losses is interrupted only by the occasional victory. One thus feels impatient with and disdainful of the euphoria that grips the country every time Rahul Dravid and his men manage to win a game. 

 Yours faithfully,

D.K. Nag, Burdwan

 Road to development

 Sir Rudrangshu Mukherjee must be thanked for highlighting the fact that Josef Stalins socialist industrialization shed more blood and caused more suffering than its capitalist counterpart (Historys play, Dec 31). The observation is relevant to West Bengal, where the communist chief minister has started his brand of industrialization. But he is following the same course of action as Stalins. Bhattacharjees acquisition of agricultural land has not been devoid of force. The administrations powers have also been used to suppress protests against the Singur small-car project. The farmers were not allowed to negotiate and bargain with the Tatas directly. Will the state machinery be as Stalinist when it is time to implement the Salim Groups projects as well? In order to stop farmers from being shortchanged, they should be allowed to deal with the industrialists directly. They should also be given the option of refusing to sell their land if the price offered does not compensate their loss in real terms. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir It is true that agricultural land is often required for industry, and West Bengal cannot turn a blind eye to its economic needs. Nevertheless, farmers should not be deprived of their livelihood to make way for industries. Bidhan Chandra Roy radically industrialized West Bengal without displacing farmers. Many industries came up in West Bengal in his time, but they were built on dry and non-agricultural areas such as Durgapur, Chittaranjan and so on. The township of Kalyani was developed on non-agricultural land and Salt Lake, todays information technology hub, on marshy land. In a state where a lot of land is non-agricultural, is it necessary to prey on farmland? Agricultural land may be taken for building public utility services such as roads and railways. 

 The boom in the American economy was propelled by the growth of agriculture that demanded ancillary facilities like packaging and infrastructure such as roads and railways. There is no clash between industry and agriculture. There is no reason why it should be different in the case of West Bengal.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

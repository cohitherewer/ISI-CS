 NO RED LIGHT

 The word trafficking sounds particularly ugly. What it signifies, however, is far more hideous. The word was not part of common parlance even a few years ago. The first international treaty to suppress trafficking in human beings that referred to white slave traffic came into being in 1904. But trafficking as a common, everyday matter, as neighbourhood rumour, as fearful speculation and guilty knowledge in the villages and towns of West Bengal is a far more recent phenomenon. For at least the last 10 to 15 years, non-governmental organizations have been warning the state government of the spread of the trafficking racket in rising scales of urgency. Trafficking is a worldwide issue this year the United Nations office on drugs and crime has launched the global initiative to curb trafficking in human beings. But that too comes as the latest stage in a series of international awareness programmes, projects, treaties and protocols that the UN has undertaken in the last few years. The government of West Bengal has been peculiarly slow to acknowledge the problem. Now, the findings of its first report are staggering. They demonstrate what NGOs have been crying hoarse over all these years: West Bengal is a major source, destination as well as passageway for trafficked persons, chiefly women. The problem has grown, unchecked, since the alarms first started ringing.

 There are some kinds of spilt milk that should not only be cried over, but also be scraped up as much as possible. It is not enough to quote figures to make a point. If there are registered cases of 15,750 girls and women as having been abducted and kidnapped as late as 2005, then there is a chance and that not too slim either of tracing some of them. It is impossible to believe that organized gangs of traffickers leave no trace. The fact is exactly the opposite. Recently, members of an NGO trying to raise awareness about trafficking were beaten up and some pushed out of a train for daring to go against the major vested interests in the area. If the state government is serious, then it must be prepared to fight a battle against extremely rich, powerful and dangerous criminal gangs that operate across borders. The question is: is the government ready to put in the necessary resources of planning, manpower, diplomacy and money into these operations? Are the women and children being sold off for sex and slavery important enough?

 Letters to Editor

 Slap with a reason

 Sir Some of the laws in our country have become outdated and require immediate changes to keep pace with the times. For example, if a person slaps or abuses a government servant on duty, he or she is arrested and taken into custody. The maximum punishment for this offence is three years of imprisonment hardly commensurate with the nature of the offence. Quite often, the arrest is made without studying the details of the case. In most of the cases, people are forced to take the law into their own hands when government servants prove negligent in their duty. Punishment in such cases should only be given if the public servant is found to be completely blameless. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Power of lies

 Sir George W. Bush and Manmohan Singh have a lot in common the former has gone down in history books for embedding journalists and security experts in strategic areas to promote his governments policies. The Indian prime minister has gone a step forward. He has embedded scientists and technologists to promote the discredited nuclear deal. 

 Take the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Anil Kakodkar. In his statement of September 4 at Kalpakkam, he refuted the charge that nuclear energy was five times costlier than coal. But non-political energy analysts are united in saying that nuclear energy will cost about twice that of coal-based energy.

 Singh then made the outlandish claim that by 2050, nuclear reactors will contribute 20-25 per cent of the total energy produced in the country. The Planning Commissions projection of an optimistic scenario for nuclear energy is 5.5 per cent at most in 2006-07 and 10.3 per cent in 2031-32. Finally, he said that the country would import four reactors of 1,000 MW each. Why 1,000 MW and not any other rating? He must have in mind the Westinghouse AP 1000 reactors, which have remained unsold for a long time with the US. Why not French Arevas 1,600 MW or Canadian 700-1,200 MW reactors?

 S.K. Jain, the chairman of the Nuclear Power Corporation, on the occasion of Tarapur Unit 3 going critical in May 2006, claimed that NPC expected to sell energy produced from this unit at Rs 2.50 per unit although the original cost was estimated to be Rs 4.30 per unit. 

 Indians should keep their ears and eyes open for such disinformation, half truths, and downright lies. 

 One last question. Is something that will contribute 10 per cent or less to our total energy needs worth losing our sovereignty for?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Indian communists are not so bereft of common sense as not to know what is in the interest of the nation. But this unfortunate lot has been brought up on a diet of strict anti-Americanism. The sooner the 123 agreement is finalized, the better for India, which stands to gain a lot through nuclear power production. It is unfortunate that the United Progressive Alliance government has to depend on the support of the Left for survival. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Bharatiya Janata Party will probably come round to accepting the 123 agreement in some form, but its love of all things American has waned a bit. So long as the economy was controlled, the BJP joined forces with the US in championing the cause of free trade. That was when its own corporate supporters expected to be favoured with collaboration on their own terms, and not competition, from US businesses in our domestic market. Once the threat of competition became a reality, the BJP became increasingly ambivalent about the role of the US. And that is how things stand today.

 Yours faithfully,

Protip Ghosh, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A sane and human politics

 BONA FIDE / MALVIKA SINGH

 It was a sane and dignified, humane and appropriate comment that came from the governor of West Bengal as he reacted to the horrors of police action in Nandigram. One immediately felt secure in the fact that there are people up there in their exalted positions who see the reality and truth for what it is. Governor Gopal Gandhi stood apart from all the political rhetoric on one side and ominous silence on the other. Where were Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh? Non-partisan, measured reactions, shared with the public, are what we expect from those in power, and it was the quiet despair and firm tone of Gandhis statement that was reassuring to us. The ordinary people, who are appalled by the degradation of our polity, need this kind of public reassurance that there are people up there who, like us, can be disturbed by the high-handed and uncouth behaviour of the authorities that govern us. He did not order any corrective action because as Governor he is not the constitutional authority with executive power, but he is at liberty to voice his concern. If humane responses such as this one are going to isolate him from most of his political contemporaries, so be it. Probity and integrity should come first.

 Human beings react to brutality in the same way, they are collectively disgusted by the visuals that confront them on television screens. When will the political class realize this?

 Sorry state of affair

 The Left has always strongly proclaimed that their leaders and cadres work for the people. Yet, they have always ruled as any dictatorial regime would, abiding by strict ideological norms, allowing for no public debate, dissension or deviation, no new thinking or attitudinal shifts, and this even as societies undergo radical changes. Their mentors, Mao and Stalin, were not very different from Hitler and Mussolini. Left or Right, such regimes and governments are merely different faces of the same coin. The exploitation is different. In these times, freedom from such insular ideologies is as important as the fight for freedom from poverty, misrule, unethical governance, rampant corruption and much else. No government, Left, Centre or Right, has been able to deliver the necessary minimal infrastructure of water, roads, electricity, education and health, in the past 60 years. Forget all else, governments have not been able to collect and dispose the every day garbage from our villages, towns and cities, allowing thereby cleanliness and dignity in public places!

 Odd man out

 When one person in search of change, growth and development tries to break out of the archaic ideological straitjacket, his party orchestrates the attack on him. In this particular instance the tight-lipped and silent high command are being perceived as the quiet supporters, allowing an agitated party cadre on the ground to lead the assault, thereby keeping their options open. Ironically, this strategy is creating a kind of class divide! That is what comes across the footlights each day as the drama continues. No alternatives to deal with the problem seem to be emerging from the party think tank. The top leadership, members of the politburo, may, in the near future, compel Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to exit. And, Ratan Tata should pull out and take his business to another state that would like to better the lot of its inhabitants. The Left should be left alone.

 While women were being assaulted by the police, I missed the images we are so used to seeing, of Rajya Sabha MP, Brinda Karat, putting herself in front of the line, ready to take the blows. Where were the great protectors of exploited women ? Or, do women who oppose the policies of the CPI(M), who are victims of the horrific antics of the police, not have a right to dignity?

 Stinging deal

 Sir The recent incident of a teacher shooting pornographic video clips of her students is profoundly disturbing (Teacher clicks, parents riot, Aug 31). It is disgraceful that people who are supposed to be the custodians of righteous behaviour and moral uprightness are indulging in such nefarious activities. A few weeks ago, there was a huge outcry after students of a reputed school in Delhi were subjected to an indecent medical examination. Just because teachers are in a position of authority, it does not imply that they can misuse their power in whatever way they like. Uma Khurana should be given exemplary punishment so that no one can dare to follow in her footsteps. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Pranab Hazra, Asansol

 Sir The electronic media are doing a commendable job, exposing some of the shocking criminal activities that go on unnoticed in the most innocuous places. What Uma Khurana had been doing to a number of girls in her school may never have been discovered unless a TV channel was alerted and a sting operation carried out. However, sometimes people are influenced rather adversely by the sensational revelations of such undercover operations. That is what happened in Delhi when the mob protesting against the pernicious activities of the teacher went berserk and burnt two vehicles, damaged property and injured people. While the wrath of the public is understandable in this case, the eruption of violence was entirely unwarranted. Perhaps the media should be cautious about the outcome of their investigative journalism in future and take care not to incite public emotions so strongly.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir One could only watch with shock the sting operation exposing Uma Khurana, a mathematics teacher of Delhis Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, drugging and abusing her students. It is true that much of the ethical and moral values in our society have been eroded over the years. Even so, this kind of failure of conscience and absence of moral compunctions still leave one deeply agitated. 

 The situation starts appearing irredeemably grim if one considers that the rate of literacy in India, especially among girls, is abysmal. And such incidents are not going to encourage many parents to send their daughters to school or for higher education. Of course, Uma Khurana should be given a fair trial, but if found guilty, she deserves the strongest of punishment.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir Sting operations by TV news-channels are useful in exposing misdeeds by public servants. But most often, there is a gross economic motive behind the seemingly noble intentions. Such operations earn TV channels high TRP ratings, and thus increase their revenues. There also remains a possibility of the channels, armed with the sting-videotape, trying to blackmail the culprits. But the most unfortunate consequence is the damage of public property by mobs moved to mad rage by such operations. Therefore, what Uma Khurana did could have been simply stated in the media, instead of it being shown as a sensational videoclip. That would perhaps have prevented a lot of unwarranted destruction. Isnt it a far better idea to call in the police instead of TV channels when potential suspects are being punished?

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

 Squalor and the city

 Sir As shown by Surendra Munshi in his perceptive article, Decline of a city (Aug 30), the character of Calcutta has become steadily tainted through the ages, and now perhaps quite irreparably so. While it might be the case that the city still has a large number of people living beneath the poverty-line, there is no reason why it should become more and more squalid each day. Compared to the other metropolitan cities, Calcutta suffers from the poor sense of hygiene of its residents, which is exhibited in the filth scattered around the city streets. The people of the city take no responsibility for the public amenities, nor do they have a sense of rights and duties. And the inefficient and corrupt ways of the reigning leftist government do not help matters either. It is hardly possible to project the image of a resurgent Bengal with a capital city that is wilting away gradually.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Surendra Munshi makes a compelling point about womens safety in public places in his article. It is likely that the roadside Romeos would care little for a strong comment in the newspapers about their behaviour. But young hoodlums are not always the culprits. Middle-class office-goers are often found making lewd comments and gestures at women. Dealing with hardcore criminals is easier than handling these respectable villains. Which is why most eve-teasing cases go unpunished.

 Yours faithfully,

Anirban Bhattacharyya, Santiniketan

 Parting shot

 Sir One wonders what message the Left Front wants to give out to the nation by celebrating the Indo-Vietnam Friendship Festival (Left realism, Aug 4). If this is its way of showing solidarity with Vietnam, and thus proving its anti-Americanism, it should be reminded that Vietnam itself is trying to look beyond its scarred history and its former political tensions with the United States of America. It is silly that the communist party should instead try and revive those painful memories gratuitously, just for the sake of enhancing its own ideology of aggressive anti-Americanism. Vietnam has given the US trading rights and both the countries in the process are benefiting from such initiatives. American capital now is more welcome to Vietnam than the pretended camaraderie of our comrades. Indian communists are not averse to gaining such economic power as well. Only they would rather send their children to study in the US secretly (certainly not to Vietnam), and then criticize the power of American dollars.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

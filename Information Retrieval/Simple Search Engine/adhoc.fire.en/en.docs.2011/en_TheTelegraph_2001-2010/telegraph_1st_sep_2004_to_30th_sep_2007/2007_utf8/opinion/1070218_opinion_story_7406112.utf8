 DIARY

 It may be difficult to establish that the monkeys of India are law-abiding citizens of the land. But there is no doubt that some of them do love the law. One of them paid a visit to a court in east Delhi the other day. Landing on the judges desk, he opened the law books and tore a few pages from them perhaps they contained legal provisions which did not serve the Simian cause. The judge, by this time scared into a corner, still managed to ask the prosecution counsel if he had listed the monkey as a witness. The prosecution denied having any hand in the presence of the monkey in the courtroom. Whereupon the defence counsel hazarded a guess: could it be that the Simian population of the capital was angered by the Delhi high court ruling, which not only barred their presence in the land of their ancestors, but also ordered their repatriation to a secluded part of Madhya Pradesh. In the din and bustle, one police constable seemed to know exactly what works in most official institutions in India rishwat (bribe). A few bananas and an apple did the trick, and the court returned to its solemn business.

 Feroze Varun Gandhis track record remains impeccable. He has again been denied an election ticket by the BJP this time for the Gwalior byelection. This is the n-th snub he has suffered, and at this rate, he may only reach the parliament quite old and grey. After being rejected for Vidisha and Bhagalpur, Varun and his friends were hoping that the party leadership would get tired of overlooking him, and give him the Gwalior ticket. And so, while the other branch of the family has two representatives in the Lok Sabha, this one is still stuck with one, that is, Varuns mother, Maneka Gandhi. 

 Blame it on the media, because these days, they are the easiest scapegoats. But Madhya Pradesh Congressmen are no less culpable. They repeated the programmes of a condolence meeting for the former chief minister, Shyama Charan Shukla, so that a television crew which arrived late could get its bite. The meeting was actually over when a new set of cameras and men arrived. Anything for some screen space, thought the white-clad Congressmen, and striking grave poses again, proceeded to read out the tributes they had read only minutes ago.

 The election results are not out yet in Punjab, but the BJP is already looking for scapegoats for an imminent debacle. And quite a few fingers are being pointed at Arun Jaitley for getting his poll arithmetic wrong. Sukhbir Singh Badal, son of the Akali chief, has already filed a complaint with the BJP president, blaming Jaitley for giving tickets to weak candidates. He described the BJP as a murda (dead) party, and alleged that Jaitley had no clue about Punjab. But Jaitley need not feel left out, he has Ravi Shankar Prasad, the party spokesman, for company. Prasad is facing the heat for his no-show as the election manager for Uttaranchal. Two, Jaitley and Prasad will agree, is always company.

 Who leaked the letter the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, wrote to the prime minister, asking him to review the governments policy on SEZs and FDI in the retail sector? Most party insiders have no doubts about who penned the missive, and that is Jairam Ramesh, former chief of the partys economic cell and now junior commerce minister. Those who have followed the career of Ramesh as a cabinet minister, have immediately done their mental calculations and come up with the name of Kamal Nath, the commerce minister, as the leaker. There is one question here, though. If Madam was really keen on a re-look at the SEZ and FDI policies, why didnt she just pick up the phone and have a chat with the PM over it? Surely there wasnt any need to go all formal over the matter. And a leak-proof way it would have been too.

 The relationship between soothsayers and politicians goes back a very long time in this country. While many old things have been discarded, this one has refashioned itself with new vigour. But not all soothsayers are willing to make flattering predictions for politicians. Take the famous fortune-teller in Hassan, Karnataka. The Maharashtra CM, Vilasrao Deshmukh, and the governor, SM Krishna went to him, but he painted a future that was not at all encouraging for either. Last heard, Deshmukh and Krishna were seeking a second opinion.

 Nearly every Indian woman has had her share of in-law troubles. It now seems that even the mighty Lalu Prasad is not quite free of such sticky problems. Recently, Rabri Devis parents boarded a train without buying a ticket. When a ticket examiner asked them for one, they could not show any. So they did the next best thing. They told him who they were. This, one hears, left their famous son-in-law seething with rage. Raua hamara ke satyanash kardini. Hamara ke sara image ke pani pher dini (You have destroyed me. You have destroyed my image), he chided them. Just when Harvard and Oxford were queueing up at Lalu Prasads door to learn management skills, his in-laws seems to have taken the wind out of his sails. The elderly couple reportedly offered an ingenious explanation for their conduct. With a railways minister in the family, they did not quite imagine it was necessary to buy a ticket!

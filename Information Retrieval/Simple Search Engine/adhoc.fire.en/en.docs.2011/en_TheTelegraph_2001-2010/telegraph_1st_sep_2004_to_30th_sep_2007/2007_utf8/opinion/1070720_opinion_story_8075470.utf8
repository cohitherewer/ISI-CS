 STEALING FIRE FROM HEAVEN

 The poet as a rebel 

 The Dissent of Nazrul Islam: Poetry and 

History

By Priti Kumar Mitra, 

Oxford, Rs 695

 The discursive formation of any grand narrative of history usually regards pluralistic voices as mere variations of an integrative thematic pattern. It refuses to acknowledge that the history of a specific time and place is basically a conglomerate of many histories, which are not necessarily unilinear or convergent. Any study of the dialectics of dissent of a given historical time segment opposes this bland homogenizing trend. It does so by suggesting that the Hegelian synthesis, which is a logical culmination of the conflict between thesis and anti-thesis, often survives in an unstable equilibrium, only to erupt into further conflicts.

 Priti Kumar Mitras book on the dissent of Nazrul Islam is well-researched and well-timed from this point of view. But it cannot be considered well-written. It suffers from a distinct lack of critical balance. The lapses notwithstanding, there are grounds on which the book has to be considered important. 

 The significance of The Dissent of Nazrul Islam lies firstly in the fact that it purportedly repudiates the Euro-Christian model of south Asian history. It explores the subtle shifts in the asymmetric power relations between organized orthodoxy and the individual dissenter, with social support getting polarized towards the latter. Mitras discussion of Nazruls poetic expression of political dissent concurs with that of the public space created by the publication of journals and periodicals in early 20th century Bengal. 

 Mitra systematically categorizes Nazruls rebellion in four major spheres. In the field of politics, against British imperialism and against the Gandhian principle of non-violence. In the social domain, against casteism and communalism, and in the religious sphere, against Islamic fundamentalism. Nazruls opposition in the cultural field was directed towards Hindu cultural chauvinism, represented primarily by the Tagorean school of poetry and by the conservative literary circle contributing to the periodical, Shanibarer Chithi.

 Mitras analysis effectively demonstrates how the turbulent national and international politics of the period had a strong bearing on Nazruls political vision and poetic credo. Mitra also charts the swiftly changing phases of Nazruls poetic and musical career, which did not necessarily remain consistent with each other.

 Mitras estimate of the historicity of the Nazrul phenomenon remains inconclusive because he does not care to examine how far the radical inconsistencies of the poets persona are symptomatic of his age. Mitras critical insights very often become subordinate to his celebration of Nazruls rebellious self. Projecting Nazrul as an incarnation of Camus rebel and as a modern-day Prometheus, Mitra is unable to recognize that Nazruls iconoclasm was at best passionate and at worst impetuous, being intellectually shallow and ideologically superficial at the same time.

 Mitra uneasily points out Nazruls preposterous faith in the Islamic base of the Bolshevik Revolution, but does not elaborate on this. Similar other idiosyncrasies of the poet are also mysteriously glossed over. Mitra cannot provide any explanation as to why Nazrul, in spite of being so staunchly opposed to cultural chauvinism, himself failed to establish a new trend in modern Bengali poetry.

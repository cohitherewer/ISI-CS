The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A PERFECT VACCINE FOR WANNABES

 Ananda Lal

 Theatre

 One thing the Mumbai theatre community has done that their counterparts here should emulate is to exploit the promotional power of the internet for publicizing their productions outside. The website mumbaitheatreguide.com exemplifies how a portal can educate, review, provide information on shows in all languages, as well as advertise and entertain. Consequently, theatre in that city has taken off like never before, some of it can even be classified as self-financed. Calcutta sites need to learn such lessons in attracting visitors to our stages. 

 Mumbais commercialized theatre remains glitzy in the artificial sense, but it has also undergone certain chastening changes. I never thought Id see the day when Bharat Dabholkar turned sentimental and even somewhat critical, but maturity does strange things to people. After countless Bottoms Ups that plumbed the bottom of vulgarity, Why Not? Productions Got to Be Aishwarya (picture), written and directed by him, actually had bright moments. 

 Tom Alter plays a two-bit scenarist in the film industry who finds that his long-lost daughter (Ananya Dutta), whom his wife had taken with her when she walked out on him twenty years ago, has arrived out of the blue and intends to stay. He hates the disruption in his routine while she tries to use his contacts to clamber on to the silver screen. They both lose out but, no surprises, gain each other at the conclusion. 

 Dabholkars open attacks on the dirty business in the industry strike us as quite unusual and a perfect vaccine for starry-eyed wannabes. Unfortunately, after all that good work he has to compromise in the end by making the girl receive a call of interest from none other than the Big B. The discovery in the play is Dutta as the daughter, a sprightly ingnue, whereas Alter himself hardly acts and often fumbles. Mona Ambegaonkar, gives a natural performance as his girlfriend. 

 Sanskriti Sagars next import, Dhoom Macha De, came from that serial offender, Dinyar Contractor, so I went with no expectations. Although Suresh Jairams script merely rehashes the bedroom-farce formula of husband inviting mistress over while wifes away but wife returns unexpectedly, the normally sex-obsessed Contractor does not indulge in the abysmally coarse jokes that made him infamous. The husband-wife combo of Bakhtyaar Irani and Tanaaz Lal may have cramped his style with their better comic taste as actors, Irani in particular as the wifes lover enjoyably as a goofy guy with a ludicrous guffaw. But despite their participation as dancers, the pneumatically-choreographed film songs that open and close the show have nothing to do with the plot.

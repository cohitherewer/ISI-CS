 Rough and tumble

 Sir Throwing all parliamentary norms to the wind, Left MPs came close to assaulting the Union shipping minister, T.R. Baalu, in their bid to prevent him from tabling the Indian maritime university bill in the Lok Sabha (Left varsity war on southern Santa, March 14). Such an incident required a sterner response from the speaker, Somnath Chatterjee. He has always sermonized rival party MPs on parliamentary behaviour. Did the political colour of the troublemakers soften his stand this time?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshay, Secunderabad

 Sir The scuffle between members of parliament belonging to Left parties and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam over the maritime university bill is shameful. These politicians have not been elected to the House to indulge in hooliganism. The MPs should have realized that their action was being telecast live and exercised some restraint. Even senior members of the political parties were involved in the tussle. What example are they setting before their junior colleagues? They should take greater responsibility in maintaining the dignity of the House. The opposition, too, should have helped put an end to the fisticuffs instead of enjoying the show. 

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

 Sir Parliaments marshals had to step in to stop the rioting MPs in the Lok Sabha on March 13. Such outbursts are unseemly, more so because the warring MPs are allies and, therefore, part of the United Progressive Alliance government. The UPA is an alliance of several parties, professing diverse ideologies. Although not initially apparent, now it seems that each ally has nothing but its own regional agenda to push through. There can be little doubting the fact that the DMK has blackmailed the government and bagged projects for Tamil Nadu. The Left response thus does not come as a surprise. The Marine Engineering and Research Institute in Taratala, Calcutta, is a prestigious institution and has the necessary infrastructure required of a marine university. It will be unfair if it has to play a subsidiary role to the university in Tamil Nadu. This will thoroughly undermine the status of the college and sap its potential. However, the way the Left leaders expressed their outrage cannot be condoned.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir The Left is right in opposing the Indian maritime university bill, which is more about catering to regional than national interests. After all, the Marine Engineering and Research Institute in Calcutta is the oldest marine college in India and has the right to be upgraded to a full-fledged university first. Coalition politics was better practised by the National Democratic Alliance. The UPA seems more and more unable to keep its allies together. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir The behaviour of the Left MPs in parliament cannot be supported, no matter how valid their argument. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) recently condemned the Trinamool Congress for disrupting the assembly proceedings. Now they have lost their high moral ground.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir A strict code of conduct should be imposed during proceedings in the legislature, be it at the Centre or in the states. If peoples representatives fail to follow the norms, strict penalties should be imposed. In case reprimands fail to be productive, legislators should be suspended for sometime, and even expelled, if their misdemeanour is serious enough. A standing committee should be formed to keep a tab on the conduct of MPs and MLAs in the House. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Parting shot

 Sir I am an old, ailing and handicapped lady without the right arm. I, and my son, Samrat Mandal, were invited by Santa Fe International Folk Art Market, New Mexico to sell kantha work done by me and my group of workers in Suri, Birbhum. I was expected to demonstrate my skill of embroidering kantha saris and other textile products with my left arm and feet. While travelling to New Mexico, the callousness of the British Airways authorities at New Delhi, London and Chicago airports appalled me.

 We boarded flight number 0142 at New Delhi and flight number 0295 at Heathrow on July 5, 2006. We had direct tickets to Chicago but my luggage was booked up to London. Samrat brought it to the notice of the airline at New Delhi. We were assured that a fresh luggage tag will be given to us at Heathrow while boarding the Chicago flight. At Heathrow, boarding passes were given to us but not the luggage tags. We were promised that the luggage would arrive at Chicago by the next flight, that is in a couple of hours. At the Chicago airport, we waited for three hours but there were no signs of the luggage. It arrived on July 11, in Santa Fe (after our six-night stay) on the eve of our departure, that too, after numerous complaints were lodged with the authorities in Santa Fe, Albuquerque, Chicago and Heathrow airports. The authorities did not show any sympathy or tender any apology or offer any help. They did not even send a positive response to my notice claiming reimbursement of the expenses and loss sustained by me. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sadhana Mandal, Suri, Birbhum

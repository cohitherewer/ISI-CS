 After the fall

 Sir Graham Fords refusal to coach the Indian team has created a dent in the image of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (Ford flipper foxes Pawar amp; Co, June 12) . Surely, his refusal is more a calculated decision than an impulsive one. Probably controversies, which seem to have become part and parcel of this high-profile post, have dimmed the halo surrounding the post in the eyes of foreign coaches . But Ford should not have made his presentation if he had no real interest in coaching the Indian team. It is surprising that he did not take into consideration his prior commitments before applying for the job.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir After a miserable performance in the World Cup comes the kick from Graham Ford (Ford flees, board bawls, June 12). Ford has quite rightly spurned the offer to coach the Indian team. He must have heard enough about the dirty politics within the BCCI and about the criticism from former players to have decided to give the job a miss. Much of the present muddle has been caused by the politicking of Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri and the self-serving members of the cricket board. The BCCI chief, Sharad Pawar, ought to step down after this. But it is unlikely, since he did not do so even after he was shoved off the presentation podium by the Australian cricketers during a photo session last year. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir When an able and experienced coach like Greg Chappell could not deliver the expected results even after two years, then how can one expect better results from cricketers with much less playing and coaching experience, like Graham Ford or John Emburey? And that too, only after a year? The BCCIs muddle-headedness is plain from the fact that it has decided to offer a one-year contract to the selected coach? Will anyone in his right mind take up such an offer? Even if the terms of service suited them, I think Ford and Emburey would still have withdrawn, seeing how cricket in India has to follow the diktat of administrators who have no cricket behind them, and that of high-profile senior players, and present stars. As professionals, Ford and Emburey know that a coach can only be as good as his team. A coach therefore needs to be given a free hand in the selection of the team. But under the present dispensation of the BCCI, this is an impossibility. Indians should thank Ford and Emburey for unveiling the real face of the BCCI. We should also remember that when India won the World Cup in 1983, it did not need a coach.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The BCCI, headed by a politician, now has egg on its face. It is clear that it jumped the gun in announcing Graham Fords name before he had formally accepted its offer. As Sunil Gavaskar has pointed out, a strange fascination for phoren coaches has afflicted Indian cricket. While it is good to keep all windows open, we should first explore our own wealth of talent. It appears that the players themselves wanted a foreigner as coach, with the captain, Rahul Dravid, specifically mentioning Fords name. This too is a cause for concern. Among the other problems are factionalism and regionalism, which have left their mark on the teams performance in recent tournaments. Reports of seniors influencing the selection process and blocking the entry of talented juniors are also disturbing.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is amazing to see how silly the BCCI can get. After having been dealt a slap on its face by Graham Fords decision to turn down the offer of coaching Team India, it should have put some thought into choosing an interim coach or manager. By appointing Chandu Borde as the manager for the forthcoming tour to Ireland and England, the BCCI and all those party to the decision have shown how uninterested they are about the game in India. Without questioning Bordes credentials, it hardly makes sense to bring him into the confused state of things. The appointment of Ravi Shastri for the Bangladesh tour turned out to be a pretty successful short-term arrangement. Somebody of a similar stature should have been chosen for the job. One wonders how many more tamashas the country has to endure till someone finally agrees to be part of the unprofessional and money-minded system that rules cricket in India.

 Yours faithfully,

Isha Shah, Calcutta

 Sir Graham Ford had prior commitments, and had once been sacked by his own national side. Why was he invited in the first place? He may still have taken up the offer, but the BCCIs insistence, after its experience with Greg Chappell, that Ford could not bring along his own support staff, must have put him off. One can only hope that the BCCI will learn its lessons from this episode.

 Yours faithfully,

Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

 UGLY KID GADDAFI 

 FIFTH COLUMN

 GWYNNE DYER

 Libya 

 is the land of make-believe, and from a safe distance it 

 can seem comical. The 65-year-old teenager who runs the 

 place, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, has an even stronger commitment 

 to fashion than my 15-year-old daughter (although she has 

 much better taste): his outfits are to die for. But its 

 a very ugly regime close up.

 After eight years in a Libyan 

 jail, Kristiana Valcheva was woken at four in the morning 

 on Tuesday and told that she would be freed. Two hours later 

 she was on her way home to Bulgaria, where President Georgi 

 Parvanov pardoned her, four other Bulgarian nurses and 

 a Palestinian doctor for the crimes that they had never 

 committed. 

 Over a period of several years 

 in the late-Nineties, 438 children in a Benghazi hospital, 

 in eastern Libya, were infected by HIV-contaminated blood 

 transfusions. By now, 56 of the children have died of AIDS. 

 Similar tragedies have happened in other countries, and 

 those who made the mistakes have been disciplined but 

 this was Libya, where its always the fault of foreign enemies 

 if things go wrong.

 The HIV infections, which began 

 before the six scapegoats arrived in Libya, were probably 

 due to poor hygiene in the hospital. But the foreigners 

 were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Early this 

 month, however, as part of a deal with the European Union, 

 the Libyan high court commuted their sentence to life imprisonment 

 and allowed them to go to Bulgaria to serve out their terms. 

 On arrival in Sofia, they were immediately pardoned, and 

 the case was closed.

 Nobody admitted any blame, nobody 

 lost face, and no blackmail was paid. The fact that each 

 of the 438 Libyan families involved will get $1 million 

 from EU sources is purely coincidental. Gaddafi may be a 

 head case, but Libya still has some oil, so his peccadilloes 

 are overlooked. And before people in other places start 

 feeling superior, let us recall another case involving Libya 

 in which some shifting of blame may have occurred.

 The devils due

 On December 21, 1988, Pan American 

 flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 

 people. Most were Americans, and it was initially suspected 

 that Iran carried out the operation in revenge for the killing 

 of 290 Iranians, six months earlier, aboard a civilian Iran 

 Air flight that was shot down by a US warship in the Gulf. 

 US and British investigators started 

 building a case against Iran and Syria. But a year-and-a-half 

 later Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, turning overnight from 

 an ally to an enemy of America. In the US-led war to liberate 

 Kuwait, the cooperation of Iran and Syria was vital so, 

 suddenly, the Lockerbie investigation shifted focus to Libya, 

 and in due course (about ten years) two Libyan intelligence 

 agents were brought to trial for the crime.

 In 2001, one of them, Abdel Basset 

 al-Megrahi, was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment 

 in Scotland. Libya paid $2.7 billion in compensation to 

 the victims families, without ever admitting guilt, but 

 the verdict always smelled fishy. Jim Swire, father of one 

 of the victims on Pan Am 103, said, I went into that court 

 thinking I was going to see the trial of those who were 

 responsible for the murder of my daughter. I came out thinking 

 [al-Megrahi] had been framed.

 Late last month, the Scottish 

 Criminal Cases Review Commission declared al-Megrahis conviction 

 unsafe and granted him the right to appeal the verdict 

 because the applicant may have suffered a miscarriage of 

 justice. That may well be true, and it may not have been 

 an accident either. But, as former British ambassador to 

 Libya, Oliver Miles, told the BBC recently, No court is 

 likely get to the truth, now that various intelligence agencies 

 have had the opportunity to corrupt the evidence.

 And so it goes.

 REHEARSING THE STEPS

 Dance

 To organize dance workshops under the guidance of renowned dancers and gurus has become a rage these days. How much the participants can master within this short span of time is questionable. Nevertheless these workshops enable dancers to be associated with great gurus and stalwarts. Interaction with them enriches the young minds and allows them to visualize the art of dance in the proper perspective.

 Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre offered a stimulating dance performance on June 13 at the Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex. A Kuchipudi dance recital was presented by Srimayi Vempati and Vempati Ravi of the Kuchipudi Dance Academy, Chennai, along with the participants of a recently-concluded workshop under their guidance. They had chosen traditional items in which Srimayi established herself as an authentic classical dancer. 

 The evening began with bhumipranam, adavus and jatis by the participants of the workshop. This was followed by poorvaragam, an invocatory number where the dancers offered their salutations to Nataraja and Parvati. In this simple group choreography, the dancers were lively and spontaneous. Srimayi proved her ease with the classical style in an innovative choreography for the Tagore song, Badhu kon alo laglo chokhe. Aloke Roy Chowdhury sang soulfully, though a female voice would have been better suited.

 The most enjoyable presentation of the evening was Marakatha Mani Maya, an abhinaya elucidating Krishnas childhood pranks. This duet was full of joy and mutual understanding, very important for this kind of performance. Based on raga Arvi and tala adi, the dancers elegantly expressed the madhura-bhakti rasa. It ended with a keertanam, where the performers danced on a brass plate, a popular part of the Kuchipudi dance format. With lots of drama and dance, the presentation reflected the true spirit of the Kuchipudi style. Vempati Ravi presented Lekha, a portion adapted from Bhamakalapam, originally written by Siddhendra Yogi. Though only a brief part of this immaculate dance drama was presented, Ravi brought out its rich textual details within the short span. He explored and blended tandava and lasya gracefully in the depiction of the ardhanarishwar. 

 Malavika Sen, a talented Bharatnatyam and Kuchipudi dancer, enthralled the audience with her solo number. The artistes were accompanied by Vempati Ravi Shankar on nattubhangam, Kantilal on mridangam and G. Nagrajan on flute.

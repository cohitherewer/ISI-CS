 NAIL THE LIAR

 Court orders concerning the environment in West Bengal invariably incite a Pavlovian reaction from the state government. No issue elucidates this more clearly than matters relating to the implementation of air-pollution norms. It is most natural for the administration to imagine responding to a query from the high court about the status of its pollution control efforts with the same set of exasperating lies it has resorted to for so long. The government hopes to convince the judiciary, and thereby the public litigants, of its sincerity by showing off a system that is riddled with loopholes. The governments confidence stems from the fact that it has been able to snub most judicial efforts at making it conscious of its responsibility towards public health and coaxing it to enforce set rules and regulations with remarkable ingenuity. The burden of taking concrete action has so far been conveniently avoided by shifting the focus from the use of BS-II engines to tailpipe emissions and then to the availability of alternative fuel. And the tables have been sought to be turned on the judiciary by blaming its ruling against the government ban on old vehicles as the reason for the administrations failure to limit vehicular pollution. 

 The strategy not only speaks of the governments brazenness and complete lack of concern, but also of its shamelessness. How else would the administration explain the denial of knowledge about auto-emission testing centres which sell certificates or of police inaction against smoke-belching vehicles? Despite innumerable surveys pointing to the fact that buses and autos are the most polluting, the government has benignly allowed political considerations to outweigh its commitment to public concerns. Sometimes election dates have determined action against bus syndicates, and, at other times, the political affiliation of auto unions has discouraged stringent measures being adopted to force them to convert to LPG-run engines. And yet, the entire programme of pollution control is supposed to hinge on this chosen theme of tailpipe emission. It goes without saying that neither the availability of alternative fuels like liquefied petroleum gas or compressed natural gas or the abundance of equipment like gas analysers will guarantee the city its health unless the government feels compelled to give up its double standards and hypocrisy.

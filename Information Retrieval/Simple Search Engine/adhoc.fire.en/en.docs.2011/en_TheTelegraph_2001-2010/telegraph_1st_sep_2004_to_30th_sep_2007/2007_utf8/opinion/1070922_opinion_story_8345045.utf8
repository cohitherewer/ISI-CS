 BUMBLEBEE IN THE BONNET

 Who needs a hyphen anyway? Or, for that matter, who needs a dictionary? The passions that would be aroused by the second question are likely to be more tumultuous by only a few degrees than those aroused by the first. The sixth edition of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary has done away with hyphens in 16,000 words, including two-word compounds. (Or should that be compounds of two words to keep things peaceful or even, two word compounds, to be dangerously venturesome?) A very limited number of people in the world would mind terribly if their pot-bellies became pot bellies. But their feelings of outrage may spawn reams of scholarly argument. Most others might be pleasantly reassured to know that they had been mistakenly according to earlier Shorter Oxford prescriptions been writing email instead of e-mail, and now they are suddenly right. The majority would not notice.

 It is the unhappy tribe of professional writers, journalists, editors, spell-checkers and similar beings in their dusty trail who cannot help but take serious notice of what the dictionary decides to do. The dictionary, however, to go by what the editor of the Shorter Oxford has said and a bit further is to popular usage as the weathervane is to the changing wind. If the hyphen is to go because writers of email and text messages find it too much of a stretch to press the hyphen key, there is no reason that you should not be spelt u or the d. The confusion may grow more confounding. If those machine-smart (machine smart?) writers of the language drop the hyphen when they write, why is the hyphen being dropped from the Shorter Oxford in just 16,000 cases? The editor has not explained, but has been charmingly evasive: Lovers of the hyphen, look away now: it seems to be on the way out. He admits to a two-billion-word Oxford English Corpus (hyphens editors) from which 16,000 hyphens have been dropped drawing on the evidence of the Oxford Reading Programme. The evidence remains mysteriously beyond the common users ken. Is it to be inferred, then, that the loss of a hyphen does not affect the semantics, semiotics, orthography or aesthetics of those 16,000 words in any remarkable way? That is, a bumblebee is the same as a bumble-bee, and therefore did not need the hyphen in the first place? 

 But the wanderer among the two billion words has much to be thankful for. He knows he will find the meaning of reassuring old words, such as oscillation, or even changes in meanings of words through the ages, such as gay, or nice. Even as he grapples with new additions such as addy and heaviosity, there is a sense of relief that not everything has gone to the garburator. Sixteen thousand hyphens are a small price to pay for the ground beneath ones feet and a communicable language on ones tongue.

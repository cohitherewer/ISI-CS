 AFTER THE 

 INDIAN CENTURY 

 - Indian democracy is not free of perversions 

 Surendra Munshi

 Taking a broad view of how humanity 

 had performed in the 20th century, I wrote in this paper 

 some years ago that there are reasons for looking at the 

 past century with despair. The century of wars, the Holocaust, 

 Hiroshima, depressions, the scourge of AIDS, environmental 

 degradation, and other forms of exploitation was savage 

 enough. Yet, in the midst of the misery, principally of 

 Western making, one country stands out. And that country 

 is India. For India, if the struggle for freedom was the 

 primary theme of the first part of the century, the struggle 

 to establish and maintain the largest democracy in the world 

 was the main theme of the second part. What Europe aspires 

 to achieve today in the form of the European Union has already 

 been achieved by the Indian Union.

 Added to the achievement of freedom, 

 democracy and unity, India has a good reason to celebrate 

 the emergence of Gandhi who has a valid claim to be considered 

 the man of the past century, if not of the millennium. There 

 were others, like Tagore and Vivekananda, whose voices claimed 

 the attention of the world. Their voices have abiding lessons 

 for India and the rest of the world. Martin Luther King 

 III, the son of Martin Luther King Jr., wrote movingly some 

 time ago that he had come to realize the importance of Gandhis 

 teachings and the effect it had on his father and ultimately 

 on his nation.

 It is possible, indeed, to claim 

 that the 20th century was the Indian century. But it is 

 wise not to be swept off ones feet by this grandeur. It 

 is the irony of Indian history that the reality of this 

 society appears fractured on all the points noted above. 

 Independence did not come to the subcontinent without Partition. 

 The Indian holocaust caused suffering to millions of people. 

 Indian democracy is not free of perversions where those 

 who are supposed to uphold it make a mockery of it. Indian 

 unity is precarious. There is hardly any solidarity that 

 is visible among egoists, caught up in petty feuds and petty 

 victories and petty defeats.

 We should not lose sight of the 

 recent past. All those Indians who have travelled abroad 

 during the last ten years cannot but fail to notice the 

 change that has come about in the external perception of 

 India during this time. India is no longer seen as a country 

 of snake-charmers, sadhus and squatters. It is being 

 increasingly recognized as a rising society with industrial 

 might and intellectual power. This respect is not unearned. 

 The new breed of entrepreneurs, such as N.R. Narayana Murthy, 

 and Indian intellectuals, most visibly Amartya Sen, do their 

 country proud. It is possible that India might turn the 

 new century into the Indian century. Will that happen?

 There are crippling problems that 

 have to be overcome. The poverty, illiteracy and poor health 

 of the Indian masses are not only a matter of humanitarian 

 concern in themselves but also a concern for the further 

 development of this country. Moreover, poor infrastructure, 

 poor work culture and archaic rules do not promote development 

 as is evident in a state like West Bengal. More serious 

 than these concerns is the invisible problem of mentality. 

 A case can be made, going back to Schumpeter, that what 

 works in the situation of slow change may not work in the 

 process of rapid change. This critical point has not been 

 understood well. Thus, if H.D. Deve Gowda feels, as was 

 evident in the controversy on the development of Bangalore, 

 that protecting his electoral turf is important and delays 

 are a way of life, and Narayana Murthys way of calculating 

 delays operates along a different clock, more in tune with 

 global reality, then we have a classical case of the mentality 

 of slow change or no change proving disruptive with respect 

 to rapid change.

 There are many such disturbing 

 acts that signal different mentalities. A case in point 

 is the manner in which the discussion about the choice for 

 the highest positions in the land has been carried out. 

 It has been old business as usual of electoral calculations 

 and petty gains. Was any thought spared for the image of 

 the country in a situation where India is being more and 

 more noticed as a world power? Was it considered that India 

 needed a president and a vice-president who could, by their 

 personalities, proudly represent the nation abroad, while 

 upholding the integrity of their offices internally? A very 

 parochial inward view was taken, even by the Left parties. 

 This is sad. The Constitution of India does not impose restrictive 

 conditions for the election of president or vice-president, 

 except in general terms. The normal expectation is that 

 persons considered for such positions should be persons 

 of eminence and of proven integrity in public life. 

 All of us can have a wish-list 

 for these positions. My own wish-list included A.P.J. Abdul 

 Kalam as president, and in the event of his not willing 

 to go in for the second term, the combination of Karan Singh 

 as president and the person who does Bengal proud as its 

 governor, Gopal Krishna Gandhi, as vice-president. All of 

 them are persons of integrity who have thinking minds. They 

 can hold their own in any company in India or abroad.

 A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has done us 

 proud. He is a man who has shown vision and care for the 

 future of this country. There was no reason why he should 

 not have been requested to serve another term. If it was 

 important to have a new person, it was sad the manner in 

 which Karan Singh was overlooked. Not many persons in this 

 country can represent the high standards set by Rajendra 

 Prasad, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Zakir Hussain better 

 than Karan Singh. Any person who has heard him or read his 

 writings knows the breath of vision that he brings to his 

 understanding of the world. As far as his secular credentials 

 are concerned, he is secular in the sense in which Vivekananda 

 was secular. Vivekananda was steeped in the religion of 

 his birth, fully appreciated its best elements and universal 

 promise, and yet was critical of its failings. 

 Karan Singh has been active in 

 the international arena in promoting inter-faith harmony. 

 His vision of India and the world is best expressed by his 

 concern to find that light within all of us which will lead 

 us inwardly to an enlightened existence and outwardly towards 

 peace, harmony and global consciousness. This is the best 

 message that India can give to the world, a message that 

 is needed in these troubled times. This is the message that 

 Gandhi, Tagore, and Vivekananda tried to give to the world 

 in their own ways.

 Gopal Krishna Gandhi deserves 

 to be noted not just as the youngest grandson of Mahatma 

 Gandhi. He has already found fond acceptance among the people 

 of this state as a person with a head, heart and integrity. 

 He came to the state as the governor with a distinguished 

 career behind him. A governor who thinks nothing of sitting 

 in a classroom along with normal students just because the 

 teacher happens to teach a subject in which he is interested 

 is no ordinary person. Like Karan Singh, he is an accomplished 

 speaker.

 India is a vast land, which has 

 crossed the one-billion mark in population. It is a gifted 

 land where talent exists among the poor and the uneducated 

 no less than among those who are more privileged. Surely, 

 there are persons who deserve to hold the highest positions 

 as much, if not more, than Karan Singh and Gopal Krishna 

 Gandhi. Sadly, political considerations prevailed in the 

 choice of persons. It does not prove our secular credentials 

 if all the three candidates proposed for the position of 

 vice-president are Muslims. On the contrary, it shows, in 

 a distasteful manner, how a secular image is pursued with 

 calculation by those in a position to decide. 

 Was it too much to expect that 

 national interests would be considered more important than 

 these petty political considerations? History has its own 

 way of forming judgments. If Jawaharlal Nehru gave us Sarvepalli 

 Radhakrishnan as president, Indira Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi 

 have shown their own stature by giving us Zail Singh and 

 Pratibha Patil.

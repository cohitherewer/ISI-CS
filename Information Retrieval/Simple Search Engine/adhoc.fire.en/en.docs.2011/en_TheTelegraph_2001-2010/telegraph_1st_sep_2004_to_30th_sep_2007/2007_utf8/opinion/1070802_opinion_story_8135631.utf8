 HOLD ON

 Even a bad peace is better than a war. The extension of the ceasefire in Nagaland is therefore a good omen. It would have been unrealistic to take the extension for granted just because the truce has survived the odds against it for the past ten years. The Naga peace talks between New Delhi and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, have reached a crucial stage. The ceasefire is the first requisite for continuing the dialogue. True, the peace process has had many ups and downs. Both sides have had complaints about violations of the code of conduct for the ceasefire. Rivalries within the Naga rebellion have also jolted the peace process from time to time. Even as representatives of the Centre and the NSCN(I-M) met in Dimapur to discuss the extension of the truce, factional fights among the rebels in another part of the state clouded the talks. Now that the two sides have agreed to extend the truce indefinitely, the focus of the peace talks should return to the substantive issues that have long defied a resolution. It is understandable why sections in the Naga society are unhappy about the delays in the peace process. But there is little doubt that few in Nagaland would want guns to replace the slow-paced dialogue.

 If the peace process has been slow and complex, it is primarily because of the NSCN(I-M)s two-nation thesis. Mr Swu and Mr Muivah want the Indian State and nation to recognize a sovereign Naga nation within the formers geographical boundaries. This is a far cry from the demand for autonomy and self-rule that has been raised by militant groups in different parts of India over the years. It is not difficult to see why New Delhi has to be extremely cautious in dealing with the demand. Recognizing Nagaland as a sovereign nation will open a Pandoras box in not only other parts of the North-east but also in Jammu and Kashmir. The NSCN(I-M) leaders too cannot be unaware of New Delhis dilemma over this. The rebels other demand for the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas also poses a difficult challenge for the government. Accepting the demand would mean a redrawing of the boundaries of several states in the region. Such a move could unleash a chain of revolts. Effective peace-making must be based on realism.

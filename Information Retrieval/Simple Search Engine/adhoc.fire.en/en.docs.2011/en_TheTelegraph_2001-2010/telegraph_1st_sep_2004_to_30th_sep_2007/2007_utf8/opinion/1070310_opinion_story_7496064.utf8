 On the Edge of Vision: New Idioms in Indian and Italian Contemporary Art (February 12 to March 4) at the gallery of the Victoria Memorial Hall has been ambitiously described by the Italian deputy prime minister as a dialogue on the topic of vision. His reference, presumably, was to a cultural dialogue. But thinking of dialogue and vision relationally has its own inescapable, though unwitting, audacity. Vision, after all, is a notoriously difficult word. Lily Briscoe, the painter in Virginia Woolfs To the Lighthouse, had to wait until the very end of the novel to have had her vision, which was then left tantalizingly vague, perhaps by the failure of language. The aspiration of language to reflect the essence of the visual arts (and vice versa) or ekphrasis is an important condition for creativity. Horace had, for instance, famously related writing and the visual arts in his phrase, 

 ut pictura poesis [as painting so is poetry]. 

 It is important to emphasize this relationship between word and image because this Indo-Italian dialogue is premised, largely, on the interstices of language and images, captured beautifully in the title, on the edge of vision. Woolfs concluding passage on Briscoe seems to have existed on that borderline between words and images. The spectral figures of Mauro Di Silvestre, fading into/on the canvas, inhabit that thin edge between envisioning and enunciation. 

 The range of installation and alternative art primarily videos experiments daringly with images and language. Sometimes this language is embodied in a voiceover, or the words appear on the screen itself. Federico Solmis King Kong and the End of the World, perhaps the most fascinating among the short films, shuffle written and spoken words strikingly. As the immense gorilla (with its enlarged, Popsicle-like genitals) goes about his apocalyptic rampage; a baritone runs a commentary in a mock-prophetic voice; a nubile woman caught in King Kongs palm has Prada imprinted across her body; a smirking Statue of Liberty foregrounds glow-signs saying McDonalds, Coca-Cola or just expletives. Heinrich Gresbecks video of Pier Paolo Pasolini running along a sea beach, entitled Viandante in un mare di nebbia (after Caspar David Friedrichs painting) richly interrelates moving images and words.

 It is not just that the pictures move, the words too describe their own historical and cultural journeys. Mariacristina Bastante notes (in the catalogue) the use of accelerations to forced decelerations, from compressed images to extraordinarily dilated dimensions in the cinematic installations. Veer Munshis oil, Aries Vincent (picture), of a headless van Gogh painting his self-portrait with the words of his suicide-note to his brother gleaming on the canvas, seems to modulate the speed of historical time. The future moment (van Goghs death) is decelerated, while the present occasion (of the self-portrait) is accelerated to catch up with each other. The combination of these two temporal modes results in the simultaneous compression and dilation of time. A variation of this phenomenon is seen in the gothic canvases of Nicola Verlato which fuse beauty and horror, with allusions to the excess of Hieronymus Bosch and the anatomical studies of Michelangelo. Some of Maurizio Cannavacciuolos line drawings, using lead, chalk and paint, are reminiscent of another Old Master, Leonardo da Vinci.

 An exhibition organized expressly to promote multiculturalism cannot possibly avoid clichs. What Lorenzo Canova, the other contributor to the catalogue, hails as modernist innovation, often comes across as an unhappy blending of kitschy Orientalism, Italian exotica and the now-mythologized clash of civilizations: aeroplanes, Bollywood, fornicating Indian deities and scenes from La Dolce Vita and Indian cities thrown in for good measure. And finally, the tour along the gallery was a test of ones patience, with stentorian sentries supervising every step one took.

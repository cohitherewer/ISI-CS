The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TOUCH AND GO

 The high drama continues in Pakistan. After a few nerve-wracking hours at the airport, the exiled former premier of the country, Nawaz Sharif, was allowed to make a point and then deported to Saudi Arabia. The first part of the episode was inadvertent. On his part, the Pakistan president had done his bit to discourage Mr Sharif from attempting a return. He had perhaps even managed to convey the import of the latters thoughtlessness to Saudi Arabia, which requested Mr Sharif to stay away for the sake of Pakistans stability. But Pervez Musharraf could not prevent the chief of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) from putting up a performance before the country that was supposed to impress on the people his commitment to the responsibility of bringing back democracy. The forced entry has ensnared Mr Musharraf in another legal battle with the supreme court, which had ruled that Mr Sharif is free to enter the country. The court will now have to decide a contempt petition filed by Mr Sharifs party. But what is particularly disconcerting about the former prime ministers adventure at the tarmac is that it has forced upon the Musharraf administration a precedent that it will be compelled to follow in response to another break-in that of another exiled former premier when she attempts to force her way into the country soon. Unless, of course, the president climbs down from his high horse and seals a deal with Benazir Bhutto.

 The choice is very limited for Mr Musharraf. Within a month-and-a-half, he has to decide his own fate. He could bar all illegal entries into the country, force the present parliament to elect him president, provoke another set of confrontation with the judiciary and stoke up a conflagration that might consume him. Or he could play safe, distance himself from the army, work out a more balanced power-sharing arrangement with Ms Bhutto, and thereby risk less embarrassment at the airport in the coming months. In either eventualities, Mr Musharraf should be aware that Mr Sharif retains enough ballast as a troublemaker. Already backed by Islamist radicals, he could well emerge as the rallying figure for the civilian opposition a factor uncomfortable to both the discredited president and the exiled Pakistan Peoples Party chief, who is busy working on her election slogan. Shutting the door does not always keep out the unwelcome visitor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 In life a politician, in death the same. What leads one to say this is the way the capitals political circles came alive following the death of Chandra Shekhar. The Andhra Pradesh politicians pointed out that Chandra Shekhar, who sat in the PMs chair only for seven months, got a state funeral and prime land for samadhi beside those of former PMs and presidents something that Andhra man PV Narasimha Rao didnt. Where Telugu politicians have spotted foul play, Congressmen see nothing but signs of Sonia Gandhis kind and generous soul. After all, the Thakur from Balia never approved of her turning politician and had flatly refused to support her in forming an alternative government after AB Vajpayee lost the vote of confidence in 1999. This is not all. Chandra Shekhar is also rumoured to be the man who put the great Gandhi-family betrayal theory in Amitabh Bachchans head. It did not help matters that Rajiv Gandhi too refused to back him as prime minister. It may never be known what larger goal Chandra Shekhar visualized, but legend has it that during this period, he also introduced Amar Singh to Bachchan. The rest is history, whose full impact may yet take a few years to reveal itself.

 Another kind of history is being made in the Kashmir valley. More and more young men there are scouting for working women as brides. When the states education department recently hired 200 women as teachers, and local papers ran the list, the bride-hunters pounced on it. In a matter of days, names were searched, caste and sub-castes matched and addresses obtained. After years in the shadow of terrorism and no development, Kashmiri young men have something to look forward to. A few sulking faces can still be spotted, though. They belong to the proprietors of local newspapers, which are losing out on a lot of revenue from matrimonial advertisements.

 First you become minister. And then you set about removing the traces of your predecessor. That is exactly what A Raja, the new Union telecom minister or the man sent to Delhi by M Karunanidhi to take the place of bad boy Dayanidhi Maran tried to do after he settled in his new office. He demanded that the office be redone for him, including the installation of wooden flooring. But the flooring of the entire office had been changed only a year or so back, when Maran took charge. That had cost a neat Rs 2 lakh, and Raja wants it changed again, along with the old Flatron TV for the new Plasma variety. Insiders say that Raja might just have got the idea from Maran himself, who had a sent a budget of Rs 1.5 crore for refurbishing his office and home when he took charge of the telecom ministry. Sadly for him, the finance minister had firmly rejected his demand. Now someone must give Raja this little morsel of information. Or the poor chap will be grounded.

 The post of the capitals police commissioner continues to elude Kiran Bedi. She has been bypassed this time in favour of the Jammu and Kashmir DGP, Gopal Sharma. Bedi, the first woman IPS officer of India, is known to have felt so disheartened at the news that she even sought an interview with the prime minister. The PM, who had himself signed the letter of Sharmas transfer, of course, declined to meet Bedi. Had she got the coveted post, Bedi would have been part of the Union territories police service, which has been riddled with controversies for long. But then, Bedis own career has not been entirely free of them either.

 Reincarnations are the current favourite with our news channels. The other day, one channel showed a four-year-old girl claiming to be the reincarnation of the dead space-traveller, Kalpana Chawla. It soon turned out that the girl was coached to play the part. Soon after, another channel discovered a 14-year-old boy in small town UP who talks with an American twang and claims to be an American scientist reborn. A rival channel broke the truth that the boy had watched Total Recall a few times too many. Now the buzz is that the Indian Rationalist Association will bring a PIL against news channels for promoting such ideas as rebirth.

 How do we know that Narendra 

 Modi is scared of losing the coming state elections? Because 

 he is making frequent trips abroad. Who knows if there will 

 be any if and when he is pushed out of power?

 Footnote

 The picture might look unfamiliar, and the name too may have got lost among the host of new political players and kingmakers. But Sudheendra Kulkarni has made a low-key, but sure comeback. He is pretty much the single most important figure behind the scenes of the anti-Pratibha Patil show. He took it upon himself to get a few heads together at an Akali Dal leaders house to chalk out a campaign to stop Patil from getting into Rashtrapati Bhawan. The website, www. knowpratibhapatil.com which gives all the details of the real and imagined skeletons on Patil cupboard is registered under Kulkarnis name, and was launched last week at Venkaiah Naidus residence by Arun Jaitley. Since the Jinnah controversy of 2005, the unofficial aide of LK Advani had literally gone undercover. BJP insiders see the recent developments as the senior leaders way of bringing the old faithful from under wraps.

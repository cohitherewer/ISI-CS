The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOOK INTO THE DEEPEST SELF

 Rita Datta

 Visual Arts

 Sanskriti Gallerys 17th anniversary show, which ended on September 8, offered the kind of catholicity you would expect in the absence of a theme or style. And though known names tread familiar ground, their expertise often helps to refresh viewer response.

 Which is why the dark imagination of Jaya Ganguly remains unsettling as nether-region creatures emerge, recalling Gorky and Bacon. Watchful, weathered, wiry, it is as though they were caught in an explosion that tore and flung about bits of body, which were then reassembled, but with spiteful randomness. Or were sucked in, like Chaplin, by some blind machine and spat out, chewed to mangled lumps. So that a foot may stick out from under a breast and eyes come in threes as though vibrating from a tremor some great trauma within.

 Luxma Goud surprised with his bronzes, which import the imagery of his paintings. A diptych was particularly noticeable for its elaborate depiction. Among the other sculptures were the masks of Srinivasa Reddy. Tribal in inspiration though they are, the artist does not seem to trust understatement and ends up with indulgent ornamentation. Tushar Kanti Das Roys long, lean figures, wrapped in a private space even with others around, brought the master, Giacometti, to mind. And Debabrata De was quite riveting in his narrative simplicity.

 Partha Pratim Debs wry quest for form continues in The Bird. But the visionary landscape of vastness and silence in his other work is more intriguing. Dipak Banerjees sacred geometry places Mahavira in the centre of a mandala rectangle, perhaps attempting a correlative to the deepening interiority of meditation, a moving away from the outer world into the deepest self, as the way to freeing the consciousness the soul to Jainism of dross. 

 Prabhakar Koltes lone work of bright, bleeding paint that overlays exposed interludes of a raw, scratchy surface a battered wall being dressed anew, as it were is a signature of urban chaos, particularly the insistent theme of construction sites as towns bloat into monstrous metros. Indeed, the artists abstractions appeared increasingly ominous for their state of permanent transition, of flux.

 If in Partha Shaws hectic abstraction of scrappy colour segments you got faint echoes of father Lalu, there were works that indicated his experiments with idiom as he induces agile slivers of paint, littered in fairly neat rows, to suggest some archaic script or code. Samindranath Mazumdars sulphurous landscape summons up a wasteland, while Surya Prakashs celebration of nature has the sort of tremulous anxiety one associates with the nervous strokes of van Gogh. Finally, there was Anjali Ela Menon (picture, Portrait of an Actor), whose sensitivity to her subject helps her weave into a delicate portrait a fragile, lambent mournfulness.

 Jogen Chowdhury, Sakti Burman, Vaikuntam, Shuvaprasanna and others were also represented.

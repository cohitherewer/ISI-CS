 Bicycle diaries

 Photographer Ashvin Mehta achieves unusual effects by defamiliarizing the bicycle in his BICYCLE A CELEBRATION (Archer, Rs 1,200). 

 Each of the bicycles in the pictures tells a unique story, both about itself and about the backdrop it stands against. The book can come in handy to a psychiatrist who wants to carry out experiments in free association. Any of the photographs can have the caption, lsquo;This is not a bicycle rsquo;, in the lines of Ren eacute; Magritte rsquo;s famous image of a pipe. However, Mehta could have easily done away with the rather uninspired introduction by Ranjit Hoskote. Hoskote seems so much at a loss for words that he provides a detailed history of the bicycle, which is quite irrelevant to the enjoyment of the book and quotes from his own introduction to another volume of Mehta rsquo;s photographs. The cycle on the left is parked in New York while that on the right in Z uuml;rich.

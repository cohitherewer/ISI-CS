 BENGAL IN DOUBT

 Doubters rarely make big leaps forward. Recent violence and political unrest over proposed industrial projects in Singur and Nandigram seem to have thrown up a new breed of sceptics in Bengal. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cannot afford to be swayed by their prophecies of doom. His zeal for Bengals re-industrialization has brought some light for the benighted state. The government must take the blame for the administrative failures in Nandigram, which led to the tragic loss of several lives. It should also take the necessary lessons from the events there. There is probably a case for a rethink on how to deal with the problems of displacement of people from the sites of new industries and of their economic rehabilitation. But all these problems cannot be allowed to cloud the larger vision that is necessary to usher in a new economic era in Bengal. Rolling back the new initiative or slowing it down is not an option that the chief minister can really consider. Whether such hesitations will drive the investors away to other states is secondary to the real argument. If the chief minister is convinced of the merit of his case, he must not allow doubts to clog his feet. It would be unfortunate if the fast-moving forces of the new economy pass a doubting Bengal by. 

 Political events of the day are ultimately irrelevant to a big idea. Those in Mr Bhattacharjees own Communist Party of India (Marxist), who want him to go slow on industrialization, represent the old, woolly-headed left. Worse, they would reduce everything and anything to a question of political expediency. That is why these sceptics want the industrialization drive to be staggered till the panchayat elections next year. This absurd political approach to development issues has been the bane of the long Marxist rule in Bengal. It is a much better strategy to be honest about the need for the transition from an agriculture-based economy to an industrialized one and also about its social costs. True, some of the immediate consequences of this process, such as the displacement of people, have their political risks. Big changes are rarely easy and smooth affairs. But controversies or social conflicts are no reason to retreat from policy imperatives. It cannot be anyones suggestion that a democratic government should ignore the popular will. But an economic idea must not be surrendered to the politics of blackmail or to ideological obfuscation.

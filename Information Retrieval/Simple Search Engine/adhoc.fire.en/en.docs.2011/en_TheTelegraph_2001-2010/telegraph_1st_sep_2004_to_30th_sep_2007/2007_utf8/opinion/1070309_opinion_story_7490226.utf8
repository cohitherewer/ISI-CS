The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A history of the inner eye

 Benodebehari Mukherjee (1904-1980) Centenary Retrospective (Vadhera Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Modern Art, Rs 4,000) is the catalogue raisonn eacute; of a master of modern Indian art who became a household name only after Satyajit Ray made a film on him in 1971. Superbly produced, a few typos notwithstanding, this tome owes its existence to the efforts of Gulammohammed Sheikh and R. Siva Kumar, who edited it. Apart from reproductions of the major works from this reclusive artist rsquo;s vast oeuvre, it contains some priceless photographs, articles by his pupil, K.G. Subramanyan, and extracts from his own writings. When Benodebehari painted the red khoai in pre-lapsarian Santiniketan, it turned into a bank of clouds gleaming with the silver feathers of kaash, as in Laughter of 1921 (left). Even after he lost his vision in the Fifties, he continued to create paper-cuts with a strong graphic element (top right), squiggles (bottom right) and small pieces of sculpture as well. Unfortunately, his murals are fading out.

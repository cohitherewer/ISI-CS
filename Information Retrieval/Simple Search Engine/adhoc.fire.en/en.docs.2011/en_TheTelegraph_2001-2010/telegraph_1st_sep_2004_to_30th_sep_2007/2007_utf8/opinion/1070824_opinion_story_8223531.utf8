 FACE THE WORLD WITH FIRE

 Malvika Singh

 Why does the present Indian political class lack the confidence to take on the world? Why does it run away from engaging with other nations that have a different attitude and approach to common global issues and concerns?

 Why do our netas lead us to dark spaces with no ventilation, spaces that are not conducive to the emergence of fresh ideas? Why are we allowing ourselves to become prisoners in a jail that is run according to norms that are set by men and women stuck in a time warp? Why is it that their overwhelming insecurity has resulted in the destruction of the energy, vitality, creativity and aspiration of a young generation? Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, along with their colleagues of varying ideologies, were ahead of their time. They went on to become respected world leaders. Instead of following the path shown by these great men and women to grow in international and regional stature, we have managed to successfully corrode and corrupt our position, thereby turning the nation into a fourth-world country.

 We seem to have lost the intellectual wherewithal of participating in international arrangements on our own terms, with our heads held high, making the necessary demands and adjustments to preserve our national interests. In the Fifties, we had forged a number of strong alliances, and Indian leaders were then at par with world leaders. That strength has been drastically diminished. It is time to renew those critical ties with the world. 

 Old and blind

 The recent attempt at an engagement with the United States of America, that has taken years of hard work to get the fine print acceptable to both democracies, one that will connect us to other major nations of the world in the next phase, must be allowed to see the light of day. To shy away from initiatives that a constantly changing world is grappling with, and to therefore be excluded from the dialogue that will ensure, through the discourse, the diversification of priorities, can only stall the possibility of inclusive international protocols, endorsing the supremacy of the rich Western world.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is probably right when he says that history will endorse Indias entry into the league of influential independent nations, and its emergence from isolation and insular ideological posturing. Why this fear to face the world? Where has the confidence of our political class gone? Where are the political stalwarts of the sub-continent? Where are the Gandhis and Nehrus of this generation? 

 India, with the youngest population in the world, is chained and handcuffed by archaic and doddering minds. This country has been forced to mark time because of a faded and failed leadership. Despite the horrors, Indians have found ways and means by which to grow. Some have empowered themselves, others have been exploited for decades, their voices ignored. 

 How do we bring about the release of the pent-up energies of the people of this land? Enough is enough. The predictable jargon and inaction have to be replaced. Containing the manifold aspirations of a very young India will only result in possible militant anarchy that will stem from the silent, unspoken, anger and humiliation. Is our political class so utterly insensitive to the open truth and oblivious of this reality? Is it so dreadfully arrogant that it does not recognize and accept the rumblings across the land? Is it merely interested in making the most of whatever little time that remains for them to exploit and reap the harvest for themselves? India is ripe for another silent and non-violent revolution to eject this ruling elite, and replace it with a vital, modern leadership.

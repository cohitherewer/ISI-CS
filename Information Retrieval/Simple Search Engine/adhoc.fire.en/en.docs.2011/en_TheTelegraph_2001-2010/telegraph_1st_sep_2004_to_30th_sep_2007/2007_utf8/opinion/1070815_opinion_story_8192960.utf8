 DEAL OF TRIUMPH

 It will be ironic if on the sixtieth anniversary of independence, India snatches defeat from the jaws of victory. This is what the two extremes of Indian politics the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party would like the prime minister to do. The comrades and the sanghis have both directed their ire at the Indo-US nuclear deal and would like Manmohan Singh to retreat from the deal. Mr Singh has reiterated that he has no intentions of reneging on an understanding that is the outcome of many rounds of talks between the two countries. He has emphasized that the countrys sovereignty and the future of the nuclear programme have in no way been compromised. But this is not enough for the BJP and the CPI(M) because their myopia prevents them from seeing a good thing even when it stares at them in the face. The Indo-US nuclear agreement is arguably the most important chapter in the history of Indian foreign policy. For the first time since India became free and sovereign, there is now the opportunity for India to sit at the international high table. India can also claim that it now has a special relationship with the United States of America, the worlds only superpower. This is a major triumph of Indian diplomacy.

 Sections of the Indian political class are not only refusing to recognize the triumph, they are in fact trying to destroy its basis. Unfortunately, this kind of failure to seize the opportunity has a long history in Indian politics. In the Fifties, India, under the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, was poised to emerge as Asias most important power. But Nehru and V.K. Krishna Menon messed up this chance by constructing the sham of non-alignment, which amounted to nothing more than making India a tail of the erstwhile Soviet Union. Thus when the Cold War ended with the collapse of Soviet Russia, Indian foreign policy was left like a rudderless boat. It needed years of quiet work with the political establishment in Washington DC to build bridges with the US. The BJP, which strangely now opposes the Indo-US understanding, contributed substantially to this mending operation. Today, when the understanding only awaits the official seal and signature, there is a cry to abandon the deal. Sixty is too young an age for a nation to commit hara-kiri. Today, Mr Singh should pledge to firmly brush aside all irrelevant opposition.

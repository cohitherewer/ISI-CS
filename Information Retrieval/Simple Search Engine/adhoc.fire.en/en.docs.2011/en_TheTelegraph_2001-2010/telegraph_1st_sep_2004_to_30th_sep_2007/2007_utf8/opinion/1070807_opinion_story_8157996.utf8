The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WHATEVER FOR?

 An officious minister and a diva-in-retreat can together create a delightfully ridiculous situation. The Indian government has been eager to give the Bengali film actor, Suchitra Sen, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for the last couple of years or so. But Ms Sen is refusing to compromise the absolute nature of her withdrawal from the world. She will not go to Delhi to receive the award. The governments rule-book says that no matter what the venerableness of the awardee, and how advanced the state of his decrepitude, he will have to come to the capital to receive this honour from none less than the president of India. Hence, Raj Kapoors near-collapse on stage and exit from Siri Fort auditorium in a sarkari ambulance after receiving the award. Ms Sen, presumably of another mettle, will have none of this. So the current information and broadcasting minister is considering something quite earth-shattering. Could the award possibly be given her at her residence in Calcutta? (But that does not quite solve the problem of Not Wanting To Be Seen.) And by extension, could the rule-book not be altered, once and for all, to make provisions for the aged and the infirm, so that they might not have to be dragged to Delhi to be honoured by the State?

 Red tape would not have been red tape if the demands of sensibleness could have changed it without much ado. Yet a Central minister and his ministry are engaged in pondering this seemingly insurmountable problem. Something that was sorted out in a trice by the French and by the Oscar Academy in Satyajit Rays case, is proving to be a bit of a revolution in Priya Ranjan Das Munshis hands. But what is all this really about? It is certainly worth doubting whether what is being called Ms Sens lifetime achievement in cinema would stand an objective and unsentimental appraisal of her histrionic abilities. A legendary face becomes even more legendary when it has not been seen for almost thirty years. Should the government be reserving its highest honour, and the minister his fervour, for comeliness enhanced by nostalgia?

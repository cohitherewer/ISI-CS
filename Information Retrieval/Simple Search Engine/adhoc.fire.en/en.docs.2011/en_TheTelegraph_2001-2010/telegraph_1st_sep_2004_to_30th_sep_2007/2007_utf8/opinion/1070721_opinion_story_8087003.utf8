 YOUNG, MALE 

 AND DEADLY 

 - Age, sex and class as factors in extremist violence 

 Politics and Play

 Ramachandra Guha

 On the wild side 

 When the Kannada film star, Rajkumar, 

 died in Bangalore in April 2006, thousands of the citys 

 residents went on the rampage, burning buses and attacking 

 shops and offices. The actor was a great popular hero, as 

 famous and as loved in his state as M.G. Ramachandran in 

 Tamil Nadu or N.T. Rama Rao in Andhra Pradesh. Still, the 

 scale of the violence exceeded all expectations. Why, many 

 people asked, must one vandalize public and private property 

 in order to demonstrate ones love for a deceased actor? 

 An answer was provided by a friend of mine who knows Bangalore 

 well. He pointed out that the protesters were all men, all 

 aged between the ages of twenty and thirty. Then he added, 

 And they cant get jobs in Infosys.

 The explanation made sense. The protesters mostly came from 

 the western, and older, parts of the city, which are Kannada-speaking, 

 and which have escaped the boom that Bangalore has been 

 experiencing for some years now. In these narrow streets, 

 life goes on much as before, with women working at home, 

 and men running petty businesses or making a living by casual 

 labour. This is a world removed from the spanking new office 

 buildings that have come up in the citys south and east, 

 where other men also aged between twenty and thirty, and 

 usually not Kannada-speaking write code during the week 

 for Fortune 500 companies. 

 On weekday evenings, and all through 

 the weekend, young men from different parts of Bangalore 

 travel to the city centre, where, around a road ironically 

 named after Mahatma Gandhi Road, are located the most fashionable 

 restaurants and the most glamorous stores. The men from 

 the south and the east come by motorcycle or by car. They 

 are sometimes accompanied by young ladies with whom they 

 confidently walk into a store or restaurant. The men from 

 the west come in all-male bands, and by bus. And they merely 

 gawk and gape. 

 Move on to the Nineties, and the 

 bloody communal riots of that decade. The kar sevaks 

 who brought down the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, and then proceeded 

 to butcher Muslims in towns across northern and western 

 India, were all male, and all in their early or mid twenties. 

 And very few of them had a regular job. Before they joined 

 the Ayodhya movement, they had led an insecure existence, 

 placed outside the formal economy, making do as day labourers 

 or part-time mechanics and the like. These were members 

 of a class which Karl Marx had called the lumpen proletariat, 

 a class from which also came many of the participants in 

 the Gujarat pogrom of 2002.

 This association of the disenfranchised 

 male with violence is manifest among all religions, and 

 on both sides of the political spectrum. Take, for instance, 

 the insurgents in Kashmir, young men from less-than-affluent 

 homes, driven by despair and disillusionment to acts of 

 violence and terror. Or consider the Naxalites, whose cadre 

 is made up mostly of men from small peasant or lower-middle-class 

 backgrounds and, more recently, of tribals. Educated just 

 enough to be disenchanted with a life labouring in the fields, 

 but not enough to get a five-figure salary in the organized 

 sector, these men are attracted to the idea that by their 

 actions and through their guns they can help usher in a 

 socialist utopia. 

 This is a plausible thesis namely, 

 that the inability, owing to the disadvantage of ones social 

 background, to win status and acclaim in the world as it 

 is, prompts young men to join extremist movements, thus 

 to submerge their disappointments and frustrations in acts 

 of violence. This thesis appears to be widely applicable 

 it might be invoked to explain the rise of the Shiv Sena, 

 the Khalistanis, the Kashmiri jihadis, the Hindutva-wadis 

 and the Naxalites. Nor is its relevance restricted to India. 

 The popular support among the Nazis in the Germany of the 

 Thirties, or for Hamas in the Occupied Territories of Palestine 

 today, has also come from young men whose daily lives are 

 plagued by economic and social insecurity.

 Attractive though it is, the thesis 

 outlined above is invalidated, or at least complicated, 

 by other kinds of evidence. The young men who brought Bangalore 

 to a standstill in April 2006 could not get jobs in Infosys. 

 But the young man from Bangalore who recently attempted 

 to blow up Glasgow airport was highly educated. So were 

 his alleged accomplices. Why would an engineer or doctor 

 earning a handsome salary and enjoying a high social status 

 throw it all away for a life of terrorist violence?

 I think it is the fact that Messrs 

 Kafeel and Sabeel have a string of degrees against their 

 names that helps explain the avid, almost prurient, media 

 interest in them. Their family life has been minutely scrutinized; 

 their friends and teachers have been interviewed at length. 

 I do not recall, for example, this kind of interest being 

 displayed in the upbringing of, say, the perpetrators of 

 the anti-Sikh riots of 1984, of the post-Ayodhya violence 

 of 1992-3, or the post-Godhra violence in 2002. There may 

 be a hint of communal bias here, but only a hint. I think 

 the contrast between the lack of interest in the social 

 background of the Hindu terrorists in Ayodhya and Gujarat, 

 and the obsessive fascination with the Muslim terrorists 

 from Bangalore today, has more to do with class than with 

 religion. Semi-educated young men from the other side of 

 the tracks will, regrettably, take to violence. But why 

 must people like us do so?

 In truth, they have done so from 

 well before Kafeel and Sabeel. For example, the leading 

 fundamentalist in Gujarat today is a well qualified and 

 very skilled surgeon. It would be interesting to find out 

 from Dr Pravin Togadias parents why their boy does not 

 run a profitable nursing home in Anand or Surat instead 

 of spending his waking hours (and who knows, his dreams 

 too) provoking attacks on Muslims. Again, while the Naxalites 

 today may mostly be staffed by men from lower-class backgrounds, 

 back in the Sixties, their leaders and cadre were solidly 

 middle-class. There were dozens of brilliant, gifted, educated 

 boys from Presidency College who, like Kafeel, threw away 

 a promising mainstream career for an uncertain life underground. 

 In explaining the attraction of 

 extremist ideologies and movements, class is sometimes relevant 

 and sometimes not; but gender and age always are. It is 

 interesting, in this connection, to reflect upon the proclivity 

 to violence of other mammalian species. Thus, in a study 

 of crop-raiding and manslaughter by elephants in southern 

 India, the ecologist, Raman Sukumar, found that over 80 

 per cent of all human killings were the work of adult males, 

 although they made up less than 10 per cent of the elephant 

 population. The adult male elephant also raided crops four 

 or five times more frequently than the female. Likewise, 

 a study in the Sunderbans found that of 13 kills by tigers, 

 10 were attributed to males a proportion that works out 

 to 86 per cent.

 Some may find these findings comforting, 

 proving that, in humans as in other mammals, boys will be 

 boys. But I find them profoundly disturbing. For roughly 

 99.99 per cent of the violence perpetrated in the modern 

 world is the handiwork of men, young men. A small proportion 

 of this violence is aimed at the rest of creation; the bulk 

 is directed at other humans. If, generally speaking, the 

 male of the species is more deadly than the female, the 

 male of our own species is the deadliest of them all.

 Letters to Editor

 The hall of fame

 Sir Mukul Kesavan has written engagingly on contemporary tennis champions and their illustrious predecessors (Ave Rogeri, all hail!, July 12). The contrast between serene and tempestuous players has occurred often in the history of the game. Roger Federer, in his off-white blazer, would be remembered longer than his aggressive opponent, Rafael Nadal, simply because Nadal lacks the gift that makes Federer one of the greatest. Kesavan has rightly compared Federer with Bjrn Borg, who was also one of the greats, with a cold and surgical attitude towards tennis. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Fatal attraction

 Sir The Delhi Police has been rather overzealous in its concern for the safety of students and visitors to the capital from the North-east (When in Delhi, mind the gap, July 10). The booklet containing security tips makes some totally unacceptable assumptions about the culture and decorum of the people from the Northeastern parts of the country. It appears that this is just a way in which the police are trying to cover up their own inefficiency in maintaining law and order in the city. Women of most communities of the North-east are given the highest respect by their people. Women from this region dare to explore their sartorial tastes because they are not killed at birth or burnt to death for dowry, but given the confidence to confront the implications of their choices. 

 Glancing through the instruction manual, it seems that the Delhi Police have taken a crash course from taliban on how to dress and conduct oneself in society. Further, it seems ironic to condemn racial profiling in America or in Britain when our own people are facing a similar situation at home. The relation between Delhi and the North-east has always been uneasy, thereby impairing the process of nation-building. Manuals such as the one brought out by the Delhi Police would only help perpetuate cultural stereotypes and alienate the people from this region further.

 Yours faithfully, 

Anshuman Barua, Guwahati 

 Sir It is a fact that a woman wearing low-cut jeans and a tank top is mightily tempting for most men in the Indian capital.This kind of correlation between amoral behaviour and provocative dressing is not irrelevant in a repressed society. Most Indian men grow up with the perception that sex is taboo, and are often initiated into sexual activities in unusual ways. The truth might be sad and shameful to admit, but India has not yet become liberal enough to allow its citizens to live out their fashion sense fully. Since the criminals are not going to change their ways, it makes better sense for women to dress carefully in public for the sake of their own safety.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir It is hardly surprising that the Delhi Police have felt the need for a booklet to protect people from the North-east from being attacked by criminals. Having spent around five years in a reputed university in the capital, I must admit that apart from the sanitized confines of the campus, life in the rest of the city is a daily challenge for people who do not quite look like the mainstream Indian. One of the shocking things about average Delhites is their ignorance of other people and places. Every dark-skinned man with a moustache for them is a Madrassi, and all chinkies are from the North-east. In fact, a patently racist label like chinky was freely used in the campus and, to my horror, no one had any problems with it. Whenever I stepped out of the university campus, I would get to see North Indian males ogling at women from the North-east. And there are no prizes for guessing what they had in mind.

 Yours faithfully,

B. Golay, Darjeeling

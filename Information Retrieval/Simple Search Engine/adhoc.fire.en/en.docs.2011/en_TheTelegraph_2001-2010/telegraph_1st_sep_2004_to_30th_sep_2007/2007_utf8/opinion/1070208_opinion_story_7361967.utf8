 WASH AWAY THE STAIN

 NEHA SAHAY

 Can a coffee shop hurt ones national pride? Hardly had the dust died down on the appeal by some PhD students in Beijing to boycott Christmas, that a campaign has begun to get Starbucks, the famous American coffee shop chain, out of the 600-year old Forbidden City. 

 Home to Chinas imperial dynasties, this UN heritage site is a magnificent, vast, well-planned city with a stunning architectural style, called so because access to it was forbidden to those outside the imperial circle. As you walk across endless courtyards and palaces, you suddenly see an unobtrusive but unmistakable sign the green Starbucks logo. Housed in one of the original palaces, the tiny outlet is a welcome respite after you have spent hours on your feet. Specially for foreigners, unused to Chinese tea as a takeaway, Starbucks provides a much-needed alternative, whether in Beijings freezing winters or warm summers. 

 But Starbucks in the Forbidden City has suddenly become an affront to one of Chinas beautiful people the young TV anchorman, Rui Chenggang. Fresh out of Yale University, Rui wrote last month on his blog: The Forbidden City is a symbol of Chinas cultural heritage. Starbucks is a symbol of lower-middle-class culture in the West. We need to embrace the world, but we also need to preserve our cultural identity... Clarifying that he often drank Starbucks coffee, Rui said that he was opposed to the location. There should be a limit to protect our cultural traditions. Four dollars buy you a Starbucks drink in America, and it is not suitable to exist in upper-class places. At Yale, he had asked the CEO of Starbucks, Do you have plans to open stores in Taj Mahal, Versailles or Buckingham Palace? 

 Forbidden sip

 The enthusiastic response to Ruis blog from thousands of ordinary Chinese, for whom Starbucks is a rather expensive proposition, reveals that it is not the class factor that fuels their outrage. Interestingly, when Starbucks opened this outlet in 2000, so strong had been the backlash that the shop had not been expected to last beyond two months. At that time, the China Consumer Journal had reported, This is no different from slapping Chinas 1.2 billion people and 5,000-year traditional culture in the face. 

 In 2002, a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet that had opened in one of Beijings ancient imperial parks closed down after its ten-year contract expired for the same reason. But, somehow, the peoples anger against the opening of Starbucks in the Forbidden City was ignored by the authorities. 

 Now, the question being asked again is: Why was it allowed at all? The reply, by another Chinese TV journalist is: It is the authorities who should be held accountable and made to realize there is something beyond rentals. Though one columnist has defended its presence as a dialogue between Capitalism ideology (sic) and traditional Chinese culture, which is common in todays China, Starbucks, which entered China in 1998 and now has 200 outlets across the country, has already removed its name from the shop front and from its menu. Only the paper cups let you know that you are drinking the world-famous coffee. 

 Actually, the most obnoxious sight in the Forbidden City are the boards on the large information plaques outside every structure, saying: Made possible by American Express. Perhaps, stung by snide reactions from Western commentators drawing attention to these signs of cultural imperialism, Rui has already declared that these boards are going to be his next target. Will the powerful bank capitulate as quickly as Starbucks has? 

 Tailpiece: Responding to Ruis question about the Taj Mahal, one Westerner wrote: Theres no Starbucks in the Taj because Indians cant afford it.

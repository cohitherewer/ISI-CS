 Breeding ground

 Sir I fully concur with Swapan Dasguptas argument on Indias terrorist linkages (In an imperfect world, July 13). India is considered a terrorist haven for four specific reasons. First, the national psyche is shaped by the philosophy of tyaag the greater the self-sacrifice or pain inflicted on the self, the greater the chance of attaining nirvana. Thus, we have been merrily absorbing Pakistan-sponsored terrorists back into the mainstream, despite the harm done. Second, the main terrorist organization operating in our country, the Inter-Services Intelligence, has successfully established its own doctrine of warfare by buying local political support within the target area through unlimited funds. Third, every recommendation made by the Indian army for the past thirty years to eradicate terrorism has been rejected by the powers-that-be. A comprehensive plan to establish a Maginot Line-type defence system along the Line of Control from Kathua through Poonch to Point NJ 9842 for blocking infiltration is supposed to have been set aside. Suggestions to destroy terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir by using precision-guided munition is not entertained. Finally, the terrorists know that even if they are captured and convicted, Indias political machinery will save them. Our erstwhile president had released four Latvian terrorists convicted in the infamous Purulia arms-drop case. The present incumbent has been sitting on the death sentence of Mohammad Afzal. It is expected that this terrorist too will be set free perhaps as a farewell gesture before he demits office. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Swapan Dasgupta looks into the phenomenon of Indian or global terror from a skewed perspective. While it is true that religious fanatics play their role in motivating people to ram their SUVs into airport buildings, more often than not these so-called nutters come from troubled regions of the world. Their desperation is often an outcome of a systematic suppression of their rights by the State. When a teenager in Kashmir or Northeast India sees his father or brother locked up or even executed by the army without a trial, and his mother or sister raped by the law-keepers, it breeds genuine anger in him. This is merely kindled by religious fundamentalists. So, a superficial analysis of the so-called indigenous terrorism in India is not going to help unless we dig deeper to understand the genuine political and economic problems that push people into these extreme paths.

 Yours faithfully, 

Pratyush Das Kanungo, Leipzig, Germany

 Sir Expectedly, Swapan Dasgupta derides the prime ministers belief that terrorists have no religion. How can Manmohan Singh ignore the fact that Muslim terrorists themselves swear by Islam when committing their dastardly crimes? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir Had Mahatma Gandhi been assassinated by a Muslim fanatic, members of the minority community would have been butchered the way Sikhs were killed after Indira Gandhis assassination. Riots targetting the minorities leave thousands dead, but that does not seem to bother Swapan Dasgupta. Perhaps a handful of Muslims killing hundreds of people in blasts and innumerable Bajrangis or Hindu fanatics killing only thousands provides him with the comfort that Hindu murderousness is nowhere comparable to that of Muslims. Across the world, Muslims are considered guilty till proved innocent. The rule works very differently for other communities and peoples. 

 Yours faithfully,

 City graph

 Sir It is immaterial whether or not the sensitive index hits 15,000 points (Monsoon humbles Mammon, July 7). It is, anyway, an inaccurate barometer of the countrys economic development. The Indian stock market is heavily manipulated by stock brokers and large investors who rig the price of stocks. In most cases, the real worth of companies is much below their quoted share prices at the stock exchange. Moreover, the accumulation of wealth from trading in the market does not contribute to the nations wealth. Besides, the share prices of only a few companies determine the overall trend of the Sensex.

 Yours faithfully,

 Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir There ought to be a steep fall in the Bombay Stock Exchange Sensex after the steep rise, especially since the stock market is highly sensitive to political turmoil. Since such a fluctuating Sensex causes financial setbacks for many investors, the Reserve Bank of India should devise a strategy to arrest the volatility of the stock market. A new fiscal policy needs to be devised so that public-sector undertakings may issue safe bonds with higher returns. This is also necessary owing to the ever-falling interest rates in government securities and public-sector banks.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Lumping the news of the rise in Sensex with that of the deluge in Calcutta hardly made sense. The rise and fall of the stock market can never affect this city the way it does Mumbai, even if it does not rain. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Chatterjee, Calcutta

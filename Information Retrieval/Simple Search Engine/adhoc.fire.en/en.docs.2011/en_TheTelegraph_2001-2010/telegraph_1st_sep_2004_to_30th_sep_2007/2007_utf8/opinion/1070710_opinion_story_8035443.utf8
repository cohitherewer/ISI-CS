 SHARE THE BLAME 

 MALAFIDE

 Malvika Singh

 When leaders across the board, 

 with few exceptions, behave in an absolutely unwarranted 

 manner, how can we expect the people to act in a civilized 

 and honourable manner? This has been an embarrassment that 

 has hogged the limelight on the small screen, portraying 

 the appalling behaviour of senior politicians who jockey 

 for power by presenting their half-truths as indisputable 

 facts, who use despicable language, and accuse each other 

 of corruption when all of them have had charges of one kind 

 or another levelled against them. It has been the most unsavoury 

 episode in public life. And, the horror is that they get 

 away with it because the media seem to have joined the bandwagon, 

 blurring the lines separating the professions. To think 

 that the next generation has these men and women as examples 

 of leaders, is enough to send shivers down the spine. 

 When Rajiv Pratap Rudi accuses 

 Pratibha Patil of her various irregularities, has he forgotten 

 about the charges levied against him when the was a member 

 of the Union Cabinet? There is no difference. 

 Trading charges

 What kind of joke is this that 

 is being enacted day in, day out when there are plenty of 

 jobs waiting to be done by these men and women mandated 

 to complete them? Why are they not hauled over the coal 

 for having failed in their duty? Why are they not made accountable? 

 Why has their prime contribution become a mere trading of 

 charges, abuse, and self-aggrandisement? The fabric of India 

 has deteriorated due to this kind of politics, one that 

 is undignified, superficial, insensitive and corrupt. That 

 is what sixty years of independence has gifted this nation. 

 Institutional growth has given way to personal growth. 

 For this reason, there is no governance. 

 Politicians want to remain in power so that they can continue 

 to reap the perks of office, and not because they have a 

 commitment and passion to work for India and Bharat. It 

 came as a rude shock when the newspapers carried a story 

 that told us about the home A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is going 

 to get in the Lutyenss zone once he demits office. I thought 

 the outgoing president had claimed that he was a peoples 

 president, different from the others, and was appalled that 

 he has agreed to shift to another government residence. 

 Former prime ministers, too, live in splendour, at the cost 

 of the exploited, harassed tax-payer. 

 Rule by example

 A new rule must be enforced that 

 compels all those who lose their elections to give up their 

 government homes and all the accompanying perks, including 

 free first class train travel for life. Another must make 

 sure that all cabinet ministers have won their Lok Sabha 

 seats, and if they are people brought in from other professions, 

 they must win a seat via a by-election, within six 

 months of assuming office. These two initiatives, to start 

 with, will be salutary in restoring some semblance of dignity 

 in the political space. Official accommodation is for the 

 official, and not for the extended family of brothers and 

 sisters and grandchildren. That lot must remain where they 

 belong without becoming parasites. 

 The best gift the president, prime 

 minister and the Central cabinet can give India on its 60th 

 birthday is a new, rational, rule book that those in politics 

 and the administration have to adhere to, one that is not 

 exploitative and is all inclusive. The second, subsidiary 

 gift no addressing any individual as VVIP or VIP, no spaces 

 allocated to this strange breed of people, no cars with 

 red lights that break traffic rules because the inmates 

 have no respect for ordinary road rules. If the rulers in 

 a democracy behave like petty potentates, why on earth should 

 the citizens adhere to rules? Set the standard and rule 

 by example.

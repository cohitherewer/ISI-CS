 NO WORRIES

 The most difficult thing about questions of identity is that they are both inescapable and irrelevant. So whether British people of south Asian origin feel British or Asian is determined as much by who asks these questions and why as by how Britons feel about themselves intrinsically. A recent poll in Britain about self-perceptions of national identity has revealed (if such polls do reveal anything) that 38 per cent of British residents of south Asian origin felt only slightly or not at all British. More than a third thought that one had to be a coconut (brown outside, white inside) to get on in the UK, 84 per cent were satisfied with life in Britain and almost half thought that they have more opportunities there. Five hundred British Asians and 235 white Britons aged 18-34 were interviewed. Two-thirds of the white people interviewed thought that it was too easy for immigrants to settle in Britain, as opposed to half of the British-Asians. Also, 59 per cent of the British Asians, and 73 per cent of the white Britons, felt that they were British.

 Perhaps the more interesting question to ask here is Why such a poll now? or Why such a poll at all? This survey was ostensibly commissioned to coincide with the BBCs India and Pakistan 07 season of programmes to mark the 60th anniversary of the Partition of India. But the problem of Britishness seems to have become a persistent motif in British public life from the beginning of Gordon Browns prime-ministership. The awkwardnesses of Blairite multiculturalism have to be overcome to create a newly patriotic Labour government, which will have to rescue patriotism from the far Right and make it acceptable again. Hence the revival of talk about core and shared values, about cricket and football, fish n chips and tikka masala, about citizenship earned by points and the need for a National Day. Mr Brown also wants to reinstate the Union Jack as a meaningful icon. What is our equivalent, he has asked, of the national symbolism of a flag in the United States in every garden? One blogger presumably white replies that he never thinks about these things unless he is made to: I live, work, pay my taxes and hang out with all sorts of people from different backgrounds. No worries. Another British Asian sees the State as a convenient boundary, nothing more. Perhaps it is time for Mr Brown to realize that it is, after all, the far Right that does patriotism best.

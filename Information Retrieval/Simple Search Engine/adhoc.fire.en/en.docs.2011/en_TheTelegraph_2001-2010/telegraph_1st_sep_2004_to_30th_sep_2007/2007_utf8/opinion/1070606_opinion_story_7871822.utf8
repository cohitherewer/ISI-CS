 Not the look of a farmer

How much land?

 Sir That Amitabh Bachchan is not a farmer was hardly a state secret (Now we know, Amitabh is not a farmer, June 2). The Faizabad courts ruling is a mere legal stamp on what people in India and abroad have always known. The verdict, however, tarnishes his image, not only as an acting legend but also as an honest human being. Although Bachchan has said several times that he was unfit for politics, this episode will hopefully make him realize that being too close to politicians (like Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh) is as bad as being in politics. Everyone will be watching to see whether Amar Singh and company bail the superstar out of this legal trap. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir The Faizabad additional commissioner has declared as illegal the 1993 land transfer in Barabanki in Amitabh Bachchans name which was later used to certify his status as a farmer. Strict action must be taken against the Barabanki authorities who must have known, as does the whole nation, that Bachchan has never been a farmer. Similar action should be taken against bodies in any state which are found to bestow the status of an agriculturist on celebrities and the rich to help them acquire agricultural land. Even though the land-acquisition plans of Bachchan in Pune are likely to be foiled after the Faizabad verdict, those of other filmstars such as Amir Khans in Vadgaon also need to be scrutinized. Aashish Kumar Goel, who was victimized by the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh for using his powers to cancel Bachchans land-deal should be rewarded with a promotion. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Like a true politician, Amitabh Bachchan has taken a plunge into the arena of land aquisition by fraudulent means. It is no use saying now that he does not understand politics too well.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The character of Pahom in Leo Tolstoys classic story, How much land does a man need? has found an Indian parallel in Amitabh Bachchan. The Indian superstar, however, is yet to meet the fate of Pahom, whose greed for land resulted in his death. Scores of Bachchan fans must have been sorely disappointed to see their idols feet of clay exposed. 

 Yours faithfully,

Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir Most people have their weaknesses. Maybe property is Amitabh Bachchans. I remember that several years ago, Bachchan was refusing to vacate an apartment he had rented in Vasant Vihar. He did later, but it seems that controversies over property will keep dogging him.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir Mayavati, after her astounding success in the UP assembly elections, had promised to put under scanner all controversial deals during the regime of her predecessor, Mulayam Singh Yadav. In the process of cleansing the Augean stable, she even handed over to the police her own party leader, Umakant Yadav. After this comes the real bombshell: the news that the biggest Indian star, Amitabh Bachchan, had fraudulently acquired agricultural land in Barabanki as well as in Lonavla near Pune. It is obvious that had the Samajwadi Party come back to power, the case would never have come to light. One wishes to know if there is a counterpart of Bachchan in Mayavatis camp too.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The planet Mars is showing its true colours. After manglik Aishwarya Rai became part of the Bachchan household, first the Samajwadi Party lost UP, and then her father-in-law lost his status as a farmer.

 Yours faithfully,

Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai 

 Sir The Faizabad courts ruling shows how low the wealthy few in India can stoop. But it also brings out in the open the corruption that exists in the land record offices in the states. It is no surprise that land mafias rule the roost in Indias heartland, bribing officials and carrying on with all kinds of fraud. One feels sorry for the poor farmers who in the process lose their land and their sole means of livelihood.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir There is no doubt now that Amitabh Bachchan is among Indias corrupt celebrities who have, at different stages of their life, exploited their celebrity status and association with high-profile ministers and officials. If agricultural land is for farmers and farming, then why were acres of agricultural land given away to Tata Motors for industrial purpose in Singur? Does Bengal follow a different set of rules?

 Yours faithfully,

Mehnaaz Manawar, Cuttack

 Sir On the one hand, a billionnaire like Amitabh Bachchan resorts to forgery to acquire farmland. On the other hand, a poor farmer like Mahadeb Mondal, who can hardly make ends meet, donates half his land for a school (Small farmer, big benefactor, June 2). The Telegraph deserves thanks for bringing the two stories together.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Sinha, Berhampore

Conquering space

 Sir Sunita Williams deserves encomium for her achievements, having set a record for the longest single space flight by a woman (Back to dog and darling, June 25). However, it was interesting to watch India fawning over Williams for entirely different reasons. While the rest of the world depended on science to help the space shuttle overcome the technical glitches it had developed on its homeward journey, Indians turned religious. What was most disconcerting about the Indian response was the fact that all the time the highlight was on her Indian connection, rather than on her success as a woman. Although Williams has an Indian ancestry, obvious in her preference for samosas and palak paneer, she is an American. The best Indian professionals regularly move out of the country and settle abroad because of the paucity of opportunities there. The pinnacle of success that immigrants like Williams have reached would be unimaginable had Williamss parents stayed back in India. Instead of going silly over Williams, Indians should rue over the implications of this fact. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Sunita Williamss feat is a victory not only for women, but for humankind, which has conquered space. The perfect landing of the Atlantis in the Mohave Desert in California also somehow makes up for the 2003 Columbia disaster that killed seven astronauts, including Kalpana Chawla. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The sudden obsession with Sunita Williams has less to do with her space odyssey than with the desperate attempt of the media to present India with yet another icon, like Sania Mirza or Aishwarya Rai, to gloat over. There was hardly any hype when Rakesh Sharma went into space a long time back because the media then were not as intrusive as they are today. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sujoy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Indians seem to have a peculiar way of unearthing relations, no matter how convoluted, to anyone who happens to have attained fame. Earlier, Kalpana Chawla had been claimed as our own even though she had long left India and taken American citizenship. And now Sunita Williamss Indian roots are being emphasized repeatedly, despite the fact that she is a second generation American citizen, born and brought up there. While Williamss achievement cannot be discounted in any way, it is also true that she has travelled to and returned from space not through her own efforts alone. Six other crew members who were on board the Atlantis share her accomplishment. Williams deserves to be congratulated heartily, but we should not go overboard in her praise, or misdirect it by harping on her Indian connection. 

 Yours faithfully,

N.R. Chandran, Durgapur

 Sir Sunita Williams is the pride of the world and is a model for all women to look up to. Her stay in the space station in less than favourable circumstances for more than six months has proved once again that women are not weaker than men. Those Indian women who have confined themselves to the household and cannot look beyond the saasbahu scuffles, should now raise their mind above the daily trifles.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Thanks to the media, Indians who had never heard of NASA can now speak for hours about Sunita Williams. Opportune publishers have even brought out books in her praise.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Roy, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir In the summer of 1873, Rabindranath Tagore then a twelve-year-old boy had accompanied his father, Debendranath Tagore, to the Himalayas and had lived for a couple of months at Dalhousie, now in Himachal Pradesh. The days spent there later proved to be an important period in the poets life, because this was the first time the young Rabindranath came in close contact with his father, who had a crucial role in shaping his moral and intellectual self. 

 When I visited Dalhousie earlier this month, I found that the house where Rabindranath had stayed, along with the area surrounding it, has been made inaccessible to civilians by the military. It is singularly unfortunate that millions of the poets admirers, from home and abroad, are being deprived of the chance of visiting the house as a result. Even the wayside board at the nearby Tagore Chowk, indicating Tagores stay in the area, is in a deplorable state, with the letters barely legible. Will someone take up the cause of the house sacred to the memory of the poet?

 Yours faithfully,

Sandipan Sen, Calcutta

 DIARY

 Power cut

 There is an element of childish game-playing in Tamil Nadu politics. The only problem is that the players are adults. Thus Jayalalithaas policemen nearly ripping off Murasoli Marans lungi in their hurry to carry him off is not exactly a jolly scene. This little bit of revenge-drama-cum-childs-play took place in 2001, when Ammas ire singed Karunanidhi and Maran alike. In six years time, the tables have turned in more ways than one. Amma has been upstaged by Karunanidhi, and the late Murasoli Ms sons, Dayanidhi and Kalanidhi, have lost their place of favour with Karunanidhi. The falling out, of course, has been accompanied by the expected dose of drama. Now that he doesnt have an office in Delhi any more, Dayanidhi Maran is back in Chennai. He lives with his family in an exclusive and posh area called Boat Road. Ever since the fracas with grand-uncle Karunanidhi happened, there have been power-cuts almost every hour in the locality. Reports say that the office of AC Nielsen, which conducted the survey for Dinakaran that triggered off the trouble, is also suffering from extensive power-cuts. But then, there is such a thing called coincidence too.

 There is no stopping Somnath Chatterjee. When he wanted a television channel for Lok Sabha proceedings, he made the PSUs cough up the funds to get it started. But at the rate the house gets adjourned, it is not surprising that there is already a crisis over filling the slots, since Chatterjee had decreed that the channel must be on air round the year, 24 hours a day. The upside of this is that the Lok Sabha channel will now show films. And what if some of them star Mallika Sherawat? Will it make Priya Ranjan Das Munshi see red then? Will Somnathda too turn red in the face?

 Dont be fooled by the thousands taking the civil services exam every year. Quite a few civil servants are also quitting the service to join the private sector sometimes for the likes of 12 lakhs a month and two Mercedes Benzes. In the last two years, over 80 IRS and 75 IAS officers have switched over. Nearly 150 IRS and 100 IAS officers will go this year, it is heard. And why not? For more than double their earlier salaries, and less than half the worries, who wouldnt? But many are not caring to follow the government embargo of a two-year lay-off.

 The DMK leadership knows that Dayanidhi Maran was a great favourite with the UPA leaders, particularly Sonia Gandhi. Perhaps to feel Madams pulse (no more than figuratively), M Karunanidhi paid a visit to 10 Janpath recently. But thats not news. The news is that his younger wife, Rajathi Ammal, also had a one-on-one with Sonia the very same evening. The Congress president offered her orange juice and told her that the DMK patriarch and his wife reminded her of her own parents.

 Guess where the Union panchayati raj ministry is run from? Irony of ironies, from the sixth floor of the five-star Samrat Hotel, a wing of which has been leased at Rs 15 lakh a month. Floor no.6 is nowadays choc-a-bloc with safari-suit-clad bureaucrats. Not for nothing did the minister for panchayati raj accuse his own government of forgetting the aam aadmi, catering only to the khas aadmi. But even he, Mani Shankar Aiyar, has to come to his five-star hotel office to find out if all is well with the rural minions. No prizes for guessing that, most often, it isnt.

 It turns out that Manmohan Singh 

 didnt wish to address the CII meeting. Yes, the same address 

 which earned him much brickbats from the media and the industry 

 afterwards. Poor Mr PM was even accused of blaming the captains 

 of industry for his own governments failures to deliver 

 on various fronts. Surely a CEO who earned crores of rupees 

 through sheer hard work was not to blame for farmers committing 

 suicide in Vidarbha or Andhra Pradesh? However, one does 

 feel a bit sorry for the man, since Manmohan Singh was a 

 reluctant participant. But the CII representatives just 

 wouldnt take no for an answer, and finally impressed on 

 him that the industry needed to hear from him about its 

 responsibilities to society. The gentle PM believed them. 

 And look what happened!

 Footnote

 It is true, though, that Manmohan Singh is a bit of a stickler for governmental cost-cutting. Circulars are always flying in, prescribing limits on expenditure, be it on home furnishings or on foreign trips. It is another matter that these bits of paper are usually consigned to the waste-paper bins, but all this does mean a lot of paperwork and time spent. The latest circular to reach the babus imposes a ceiling of Rs 2,500 per month on telephone bills both fixed line and mobile. As expected, there is a deluge of queries: about pre-paid and post-paid connections, carried-over monthly expenditure, and so on. Think of the quantum of work needed to implement these decisions, after meeting all the questions, and then think of what else could have been done with the same effort. The leaking of thousands of crores of rupees from the outlays on social welfare projects could be plugged, for one. Or the theft of subsidized commodities prevented, perhaps?

 NEW AGE TRAGEDY

 It all boils down to money. That is, if what the police have so far uncovered about the death of Adnan Patrawala turns out to be correct. Adnan, although only 16, had an expensive car he loved to drive, a proportionately expensive cellphone and a laptop computer, he loved to party and play pool and, with the unsuspecting confidence of a happy 16-year-old, let the world know all this on a popular friendship site. And Sujith Nair, jobless, wanted money to go to Dubai, a trip that his parents, who had once worked there, would not finance. The others in the alleged plot to kidnap Adnan for ransom were supposedly interested in a little bit of extra wealth to continue living the high life for the next few years. The abduction allegedly turned into panic-stricken murder when the inexperienced gang found that the police were after them.

 It is an ugly and pitiful story, a tragedy no parent should have to experience. But it is pointless to blame the dangers of friendship sites, or of the easy mixing around in pool parlours in one of which Adnan would meet his newfound friends or the many freedoms granted by prosperity. The heady mix of youth and wealth has its own logic, as does the advance of technology and communications. The morals and culture of one phase of development cannot be made to stand in for another. After all, the story is an old one: abduction for greed, then murder in panic. The circumstances are New Age. The human challenge in every phase of transition is to evolve the values and culture that can counter new temptations and undermine new forms of violence. Perhaps the apparent failure in India to cope with the dynamic outburst of wealth and technology lies here at the moment, just as the solution, even if partial, lies here too. Monitoring friendship sites or pool parlours, for example, is not only impossible, but it is also undesirable. It would only mean an increase in lawless behaviour. A tragedy like Adnans can be prevented, but a certain amount of time-consuming preparation is needed for that.

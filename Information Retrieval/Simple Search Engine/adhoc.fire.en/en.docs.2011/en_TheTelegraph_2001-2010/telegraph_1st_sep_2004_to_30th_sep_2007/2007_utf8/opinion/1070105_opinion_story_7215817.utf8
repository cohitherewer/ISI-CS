 A Region in Turmoil: South Asian Conflicts Since 1947

 South Asia, which extends from the Hindu Kush to the Malay Peninsula, is a region full of turmoil. This area has experienced a series of conventional and low-intensity conflicts after World War II. Rather than pre-colonial or colonial legacies, the issues behind these conflicts are traceable to the post-colonial era. Rob Johnson analyses the nature of the wars that had occurred in this zone of conflict.

 The biggest power and would-be hegemon in this region is India. By no means is its intention pacifist. It possesses the worlds second largest army, boasting 1.1 million men. In 1992-93, the defence budget consumed about 15 per cent of the total budget. The second most powerful nation is Pakistan, with a 510,000-strong army. In the Nineties, Pakistans defence outlay accounted for 30 per cent of the total budget, which amounted to 8 per cent of the GDP.

 Both inter-state and intra-state conflicts threaten the south Asian states. Most of the states are composed of diverse ethnic communities, many of whom are demanding independence. Frequently, intra-state conflicts turn into inter-state conflicts. In 1947, as the Pakistani-supported raiders entered Kashmir, India went for a military solution. The result was the first India-Pakistan war which ended in 1948, with the United Nations brokering a ceasefire. The Pakistani plan to infiltrate insurgents into Kashmir in 1965 resulted in the second Indo-Pak war. However, the Kashmir problem still sours the relation between the two nuclear states. 

 Despite religious homogeneity, secessionist conflicts occurred in Pakistan. When the Muslims of East Pakistan demanded independence, the Pakistan army in May 1971 tried to crush the rebellion. The Pakistan air force used napalm against villages. As the civilians fled to India, the latter took military action, besides supporting the Mukti Bahinis guerrilla war against the Pakistani forces. The result was the 1971 India-Pakistan war and the birth of Bangladesh.

 Pakistans internal troubles continue to simmer. In the North-West Frontier Province, the Pushtuns demand an independent Pushtunistan. Just after the formation of Pakistan, the Pushtuns rebelled in 1949, and were replied with air strikes. 

 Transnational links among the insurgents and the use of child soldiers are the chief characteristics of south Asian intra-state wars. In Sri Lanka, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is conducting a guerrilla campaign for an independent eelam in the Jaffna peninsula. Most of the LTTE fighters are children and 40 per cent are girls. The LTTE acquires arms from Philippines and Pakistan.

 Occasionally, conflicts in south Asia have been products of global rivalry. An example is the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan between 1979-89. The rise of taliban, which was trained by Pakistans ISI and financially backed by the CIA, was a spill-over effect of the Cold War.

 Numerous books have been written on various isolated conflicts that have occurred in India and Pakistan. But A Region in Turmoil is first of its kind. Johnson deserves praise for studying the various conflicts in south Asia in a comparative context. However, if Johnson extended his comparative analysis to include the conflicts that occurred in the Far East and in the Middle East, then he would have found out that in terms of manpower casualties, the interstate conflicts of south Asia were minuscule.

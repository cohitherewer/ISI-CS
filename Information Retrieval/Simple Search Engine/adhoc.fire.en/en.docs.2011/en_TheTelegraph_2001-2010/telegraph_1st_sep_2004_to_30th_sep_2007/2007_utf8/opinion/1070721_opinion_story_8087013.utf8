 POINT MAN 

 Without 

 the bindu, a black hole from which emerged light 

 and energy, there would have been no life. Unless the Hindu 

 philosophers thought of it, there would have been no Syed 

 Haider Raza as well. Certainly not the Raza we have known 

 for the past 85 years of his life. This master of Indian 

 contemporary art, whose canvases sell for close to a crore 

 today, spent an entire lifetime painting dots and concentric 

 circles, albeit with hundreds of variations, often juxtaposed 

 with other geometrical forms such as triangles. All of Razas 

 works have a strong sense of design in which colours and 

 shapes complement each. So they should have been hot favourites 

 with weavers who could use them to produce works meant for 

 everyday wear and tear. Till now, however, nobody had tried 

 to translate Razas paintings into textiles. 

 K2, the gallery at Lansdowne Terrace, 

 opened recently with an exhibition of tapestry inspired 

 by Razas paintings. Raza uses primary colours such as red, 

 yellow and blue and, occasionally, green in his works. Black 

 was also there; not the black of negation but a life force 

 which aided creation. The master weaver, who remains unnamed, 

 used the same shades and designs. At every stage of production, 

 the pieces were taken to Raza for his approval. Finally, 

 when everything was to his satisfaction, Raza signed each 

 piece of tapestry. So, although he never created them with 

 his own hands, they were as good as his own. His serigraphs 

 were also there but they are not a patch on his paintings.

 Late show

 Srabosti, a reputed institution 

 of Kathak dance, started its annual show almost an hour 

 late at Gyan Manch on July 7. The traditional Ganesh vandana 

 was the curtain-raiser, performed by the youngest students 

 of the institution. This was followed by an audio-visual 

 presentation of the groups performance at the International 

 Dance Festival held last September at St. Petersburg, although 

 one wonders if this was necessary. Uttaran, which followed, 

 told the story of a child artistes blossoming into a mature 

 dancer. Sanjay Bhattacharya, as its choreographer, left 

 his mark. So did the uniqueness of the costume. The first 

 half of the function came to an end with a tarana 

 and a bhav performed by Bhattacharya. He danced with 

 a lot of grace. The second half of the show had Mrigtrishna, 

 a dance drama which portrayed the misery of a child in todays 

 world. Thematically, it could offer nothing new to the audience, 

 but the dancers were brilliant in their individual roles.

 MAN WITH A MISSION

 Malvika Singh

 Prakash Karat will go down in modern history as a footnote for having compelled this mid-term poll that seems to be slated for December 2007. Things could change marginally. The date could creep into early 2008, but there is no doubt that this comrade has, single-handedly, orchestrated the hysterical Left dissension, refusing to hear or debate anything that was not a part of his hardline agenda. It is always the leaders who have nothing to do, no responsibility or accountability, who aggressively indulge in rabble-rousing, deflecting attention from the issues that need to be addressed. This undemocratic, polarized behaviour is unwarranted and does no good to a multi-layered, plural India. The glaring lack of responsible leadership is what has marginalized the Left in the larger public domain.

 New regional forces, working for the less privileged in our hierarchical system, are becoming far more powerful, and popular, for having replaced those who failed to deliver for the poor despite their rhetoric and promises. Dictatorial regimes of the recent past carry horrific memories. Their leaders are seen today as monsters who rode roughshod over the will of vast populations, providing their blind ideological beliefs as explanations for their misdeeds. The last of the fist-waving stragglers need to rethink and regroup. A new, inclusive ideology has to come into play. Politburo diktats will no longer be acceptable to a new generation. 

 Mamata Banerjees meeting with the prime minister may lead to a temporary alliance. This, even if for a short spell, could cause fissures in the Left landscape in West Bengal. Quiet meetings that the press do not go to town with, carry substance. Beware. 

 Number game

 In this scenario, try and imagine the remote possibility of the Congress aligning with Nitish Kumar in Bihar, dumping the RJD in the bargain. This kind of out-of-the-box political manipulation could lay the ground for a new Congress-led coalition. Alas, this is mere kite-flying. 

 If the Congress remains as predictable as it has been historically, it may well miss the bus and be forced to struggle, once again, with a motley crowd of political opportunists inside and outside the ruling coalition. However, if the UPA risks dissolving parliament immediately, remaining a caretaker government for three months till the election commission gets its act together, it may well return with a far larger number. The Congress is clearly upbeat and its leaders are confident. Are the other members of the UPA sure of their acceptance if a mid-term poll is called? 

 As someone who watches the shenanigans of political players, it is evident that most have shirked work, have operated primarily to further their own interest, have tried to consolidate their political future, and have not extended themselves to their constituents nor put in place the desperately needed infrastructure. Members of parliament grab free sarkari houses in Delhi, live in Delhi or sometimes in state capitals, and rule the roost from their isolated perch. Their behaviour is reminiscent of empires in decline.

 Few politicians and leaders are respected. Indians are, more often than not, embarrassed by the manner and persona of those who rule. Professionals stay away from politics because the game has been overwhelmed by intellectual and personal corruption. The UPA should capitalize on this and much more by declaring elections thereby putting an end to this mudslinging and constant adjournment of parliament, debate and discussion for all the wrong reasons. The inability to exercise the mind, to think through sane alternatives, has destroyed the sense of wellbeing of this fledgling nation-state. They may go past the post with more than they imagine!

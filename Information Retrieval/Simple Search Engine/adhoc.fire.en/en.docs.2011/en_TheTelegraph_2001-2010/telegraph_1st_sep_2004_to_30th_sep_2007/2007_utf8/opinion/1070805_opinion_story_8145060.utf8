 WITH THE SEVERE MASTER

 - The one and only way to be alive

 Aveek Sen

 And Death, the severe master, invites them to dance. Jof (the juggler) in Bergmans The Seventh Seal.

 Stumbling out into the world from the darkened cinema is as much part of an encounter with Bergman or Antonioni as watching the film itself. If you are with a friend, you look desperately for for a place to sit and have a coffee and talk, and to look at people and the city and the afternoon light with what Shakespeare calls washd eyes. If it was a Bergman, then the chances are unless you have been watching Smiles of a Summer Night that you have feared and trembled through the last couple of hours, and wept towards the end with a fullness of heart that no real loss or happiness has ever managed to make you feel. If it was an Antonioni, especially a black-and-white one from the early Sixties, then you have gone still and cold inside yourself, and are full of a sense of the pointlessness of things. Yet, although youre not Monica Vitti in a Little Black Dress, desolation has never been so stylish. And it suddenly feels awfully middle-class to want to get anything meaningful across, in spoken words, to a person you love (or think you love) or vaguely desire (or think you vaguely desire). 

 That is the immediate as it were, sociable aftermath. But later, as life resumes, another process, a kind of secret ministry solitary and interior begins, by which these moving images become part of the texture, rhythm, structure and standards of our lives. Like a hidden river, this process surfaces fleetingly into articulated awareness, only to vanish again into the deeps of memory and of unthinking consciousness.

 While walking through a deserted, unfamiliar town, or sitting beside a loved one lying ill in a hospital room, or in the middle of a difficult, painful and futile conversation, or when trying to teach Shakespeare to somebody terribly young or write something impossibly complicated with precision and clarity, while listening to Bach, standing in front of a painting, watching a bad film or smoking a quiet cigarette, the films come back. An image or a feeling appears like a genie out of a bottle, transforming the seen, felt or remembered into something understood, confronted or vividly lived.

 It is in this way that a work of art becomes a friend to man. In all its perfection and coldness, it generously allows us to feel that we could have created it ourselves. It lets us come to it both solemnly and frivolously, bringing to it our silences as well as our conversation, our intensities and our lightness. This is why there is a darkly amusing quality to Antonioni and Bergman dying within a few hours of each other. It is as if their sprawling, daunting oeuvres have become, at last, one great double-plot in which Anna vanishes mysteriously among the Aeolian Isles to become Karin walking out of the Nordic seas; or a game of chess with Death becomes a game of tennis without a ball.

 If J.M. Coetzees Youth is a sort of autobiography, then sometime in the mid-Nineties in London (I forget the exact year), Coetzee and I must have watched the same Antonioni season in the musty, coal-grey darkness of the Everyman cinema in Hampstead. He was yet to become a famous writer then, trying to cope with the bleakness of his job with IBM. I was a literature student in my late twenties, without much of a care in the world, trying to improvise ways of staying away from a PhD on Keats that wasnt going anywhere at all. Every day, I would attempt to transcribe what Keats had scribbled into his copy of Burtons Anatomy of Melancholy. I sat in a room in the Keats House that was right next to the one in which, as a plaque on the wall explained, he coughed up his first drop of blood. It was summer outside, and the Everyman was just down the hill. And each morning, the Good Angel would whisper Keats! and the Better Angel Antonioni! in my ear. 

 I think both Coetzee and I found in Monica Vittis beautiful, metaphysically bored face in LEclisse the perfect image for the sense of an existential impasse that brought out of him a masterpiece of unremitting greyness, Youth, and out of meabsolutely nothing. His was a crisis in personal history, an eclipse. Mine just a summer of delicious, diligent, movie-watching Indolence. The Antonioni season started with La Notte, that great banquet of dead feelings, at the end of which Jeanne Moreau reads out to Marcello Mastroianni, as dawn is slowly breaking, a love-letter he had written her once, but now fails to recognize. It finished with Zabriskie Point, with those epic, slow-motion explosions at the end, in which every bit of the American Dream is blown up a brilliant, self-referential pun? into smithereens to Pink Floyds apocalyptic music.

 Coetzees narrator falls in love with Vitti, but despairs over being unable to make any difference to her anguish: Even if he found a room for the two of them, a secret retreat in some quiet, fogbound quarter of London, he suspects she would still, at three in the morning, slip out of her bed and sit at the table under the glare of a single lamp, brooding, prey to anguish. Yet, in spite of this impossible love, and in spite of feeling that Vittis pain must be driven by something more complicated than the hydrogen bomb or a failure on Gods part to speak to her (that is Karins province), the narrator of Youth tries, but fails to find anything in his heart that he can properly recognize as Angst: Angst seems to be a European, a properly European, thing; it has yet to find its way to England, to say nothing of Englands colonies.

 Like this white South African, I too remember feeling a rising sense of disappointment with a country most of whose intelligent citizens would invariably come up with a curious mix of embarrassment and resentment when faced with what Coetzee calls the life of the mind. Yet, unlike the man in Youth, this feeling would inevitably take me back to what I had watched and shared, with unabashed excitement, with my friends and family in Calcutta. What stirred me in Antonioni and Bergman was alien to the English soul (pretentious and decadent were their favourite words for these films), but growing up with Rays oeuvre in Calcutta, together with everything else that came with it the books, the people, the pictures and the music made me feel unselfconsciously at home in the flickering darkness of that cosmopolitan universe. (I too didnt have a spot of Angst in my soul. But does one have to be Russian, adulterous or suicidal in order to respond to Anna Karenina?)

 It was a strange case of being culturally cross-eyed. Watching LEclisse and Smiles of a Summer Night at the Everyman would fill me with a longing for the Calcutta I had missed: those cinematically magical years from the late Fifties to the early Seventies, during which I either didnt exist or was too young to watch Death in Venice in Metro, Pratidwandi in Bijoli or La Dolce Vita in Society. And while watching Aranyer Din Ratri in Priya recently with a friend who was seeing it for the first time, I longed to sit with her in the Everyman and watch Smiles again. For the Ray of Days and Nights and the Bergman of Smiles are kindred, Mozartian spirits. This is much larger than influence. It was a confluence rather, the coming together of an exhilarating, and now vanished, cosmopolis of creativity and shared sensibilities and standards embodied, in Calcutta, in a single, towering presence even if what was shared was often just the obsessive seriousness with which films were made, watched and valued.

 While he had started working on LAvventura, Antonioni had given his answers to a questionnaire on film-making that were published twice during 1958-59 the years of Parash Pathar, Jalshaghar and Apur Sansar, and of Bergmans The Face, The Virgin Spring and The Devils Eye. His words, spoken on behalf of men of the cinema, encompass the diverse achievements of all seven films: I feel that there is one thing that we absolutely must do: defend the principle of intelligence within the heart of the real. And reject the mental laziness and conformity of the manyThis is the one and only way to be alive.

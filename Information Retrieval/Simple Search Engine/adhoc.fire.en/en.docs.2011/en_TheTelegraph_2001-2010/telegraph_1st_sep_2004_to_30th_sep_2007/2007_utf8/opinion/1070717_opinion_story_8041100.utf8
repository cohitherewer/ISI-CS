 JUST A DAY AT THE MUSEUM

 - Invaluable manuscripts, paintings, relics and remains are 

 scattered throughout Calcuttas museums and libraries. A look 

 at how much care is taken of them

 It was a bleak grey day on which 

 I entered the portals of Calcuttas Indian Museum and was 

 greeted by even more greyness inside. The huge ill-lit chambers 

 with their musty smell did not seem particularly welcoming. 

 Damp had created patterns on the floor of the room exhibiting 

 the 150-million-years old fossils from the Siwaliks. The 

 yellowing labels were covered with dust. It was like entering 

 a crypt.

 I thought that archaeology might 

 cheer me up. So I visited the Bharhut Gallery, which houses 

 the Buddhist stupas, only to find it padlocked. It 

 is shut apparently because of staff-shortage, although there 

 is no notice anywhere to this effect. 

 Discouraged, I entered the Painting 

 section. Do the authorities know that water has seeped into 

 the top right-hand corner of Jamini Roys Three Women? 

 Feeling miserable, I hurried to the Zoological section and 

 found the love of Ashok and Archana etched on the colossal 

 skull of the Little Picked Whale. In the verandah outside 

 the Invertebrate Fossil gallery, the trunk of a prehistoric 

 tree was soaked in 21st century rain. When I emerged from 

 the museum, even the leaking sky seemed bright compared 

 to the dim, dusty interiors of the national museum of India. 

 If the officials in the museum ever wake up to their task, 

 they might start with dispelling the gloom inside by improving 

 the quality of light over the exhibits.

 There are two museums on the southern 

 fringes of Calcutta: the State Archaeological Museum and 

 the Gurusaday Museum of folk art and crafts. In the first, 

 the staff are overwhelmed to have visitors who are not students 

 of archaeology. In the second, power is saved by switching 

 off the lights and fans in the exhibit galleries when there 

 are no visitors which is most of the time. Some of the 

 countrys most priceless ancient artefacts are stored in 

 these two museums such as the relics of Chandraketugarh 

 and Nandadirghi Vihara in the State Archaeological Museum 

 and the fast-disappearing art-forms of kantha and 

 mould-making in the Gurusaday Museum. Unlike many sister-institutions, 

 these two are not headed by bureaucrats but by a trained 

 museologist and an academic respectively. From what they 

 have to say, it also appears that thought and funds are 

 regularly spent on maintenance and acquisition. Then why 

 arent there exhibition weeks, publicity campaigns informing 

 people about new acquisitions, audio-visual shows and student-trips? 

 People need to first be aware of the existence of these 

 museums and their holdings before visiting them.

 The Asiatic Society, founded in 

 1784 by William Jones, is in itself an item of national 

 heritage. The maintenance of the old building, built in 

 1805, is under the direct control of the president of India. 

 The new building, started in 1965, is a storehouse of over 

 2,00,000 precious volumes and around 60,000 manuscripts 

 in various classical and Indian languages. Till 1868 the 

 collection included many archaeological relics, but as it 

 became unmanageably large, the sculptures, coins and rock 

 specimens have been sent to the Indian Museum and the Geological 

 Survey of India. 

 The documents are kept guarded 

 in controlled temperature and humidity. There is a conservation 

 wing that inspects these invaluable documents once a month. 

 Members of the public can request permission to see these 

 objects or use the library. Many of these have been microfilmed 

 or published in papers of the Society. There is an ongoing 

 digitization project to ensure greater access to rare materials 

 that are too delicate to be handled for research. Only a 

 few grimy-looking paintings are displayed on the walls. 

 And, there is no descriptive catalogue of the holdings.

 Somak Ghoshal 

 A museum is a complete circuit 

 of knowledge, says Gholam Nabi, the head of the documentation 

 department at The Victoria Memorial, and my guide through 

 the galleries for the day. As his tongue rolls out the names 

 of artists and their works on display, I keep looking under 

 the carpet. But the material on display and the manner of 

 display belie my expectations (and cynicism). At the end 

 of the day, I am willing to believe that archival documents 

 and paintings are not seasonally, and invariably, damaged 

 by the elements here. This museum boasts one of the better-kept 

 archives in the city as well as a manuscript copy of Abul 

 Fazls Ain-i-Akbari, Tipu Sultans notebook, Wajid 

 Ali Shahs Musammi Ba Banni and the manuscript of 

 Dara Shukohs Majma-ul-Bahrain. The art restoration 

 and conservation departments run periodic checks on paintings 

 and documents to gauge the weeks environmental damage. 

 The Victoria Memorial, however, has abolished chemical bleaching 

 since chemicals degrade paper artefacts. Instead, careful 

 sun bleaching and the use of adhesives resistant to micro-organisms 

 are used at present. 

 I find the manuscripts and books 

 on display confined to glass boxes with silica jelly pouches 

 in the corners. But I remain doubtful as to the priceless 

 texts, manuscripts included, that scholars can access. Since 

 they can handle these documents, the less scrupulous among 

 them may damage them. Chittaranjan Panda, the curator, acknowledges 

 this fact. But he believes that it would be unfair to deny 

 the scholar a feel of the original text. But the memorial 

 is also rapidly digitizing the documents. As I handle a 

 musical treatise, bound but brittle, dedicated to the archduke 

 Franz Ferdinand of Austria, I have a compact disc containing 

 its digitized version on the table. Brittle books such as 

 this one are first handed over to the conservation section 

 and digitized afterwards. If the target of full digitization 

 by 2008 can be met, the archives will be available online 

 for scholars and laymen alike.

 There is a portrait of Cally Kissen 

 Tagore in a corner of the Western Art Gallery at Jorasanko. 

 The man in the frame looks distinctly unhappy. Perhaps his 

 despondency has to do with the gaping hole on the canvas, 

 near his left knee, through which one can see a piece of 

 green plastic. But then, Cally Kissen Tagore is not alone 

 in his misery. The Rabindra Bharati Museum has a fair share 

 of paintings of eminent men and women in various stages 

 of neglect. In the Dwarakanath Kaksha, Raja Rammohun Roys 

 portrait bears an ugly gash near the head. Only the Japan 

 Gallery and the Indian Art Gallery seem to be in good condition. 

 The museum faces other problems 

 too. Display space is inadequate. Many artefacts are locked 

 up in strongrooms for want of space. Funds and chemicals, 

 crucial for restoration work, are scarce as well. 

 The real problems are those of 

 authoritarian control and lack of transparency. Even the 

 most trivial questions sent a shudder through the vice-curator, 

 popularly known as chhordi, who, in a quivering voice, 

 pleaded that she could only speak after receiving the registrars 

 permission. It seems that chhordi was only following 

 the rules. A visit to Rabindra Bhavan, in Santiniketan, 

 had to be scrapped after failing to secure the approval 

 of the elusive vice-chancellor. Apparently, no one can look 

 at the collections held in storage in Rabindra Bhavan without 

 the vice-chancellors permission.

 Uddalak Mukherjee

 In a corner of Acharya Prafulla 

 Chandra Road stands a 114-year-old crimson edifice, the 

 Bangiya Sahitya Parishad. It seems to stand as a testament 

 to the disregard we show our historical artefacts. Its museum, 

 which houses priceless sculptures dating as far back as 

 the 6th century Gandhara period, has been closed for renovation 

 since the early Nineties. One Central government grant of 

 Rs 12 lakh in 2005 and the annual state government grant 

 of Rs 10 lakh do little to rehabilitate the Parishads crumbling 

 infrastructure. The librarys over 2.5 lakh books lie in 

 disrepair the lack of shelf space allows only a limited 

 number of books to be displayed in glass cases. The rest 

 are relegated to the stack-room, their yellowing pages and 

 broken spines collecting dust and cobwebs a pitiful tribute 

 to one of the best Bengali literature collections in the 

 world. Vidyasagars personal literature collection lies 

 locked away and inaccessible, as does the Parishads collection 

 of over 6,000 punthis in Bengali and Sanskrit, which 

 have been fumigated and wrapped in cloth to be stored in 

 air-conditioned rooms. But rising electricity bills and 

 fire hazards mean that the ACs are on only during working 

 hours. 

 A sculpture lies on the stack-room 

 floor, tethered to a pillar. Bankimchandras favourite chair 

 is relegated to a corner among straw-filled cardboard boxes 

 into which the smaller artefacts are being packed. An antique 

 steel armoire on the ground floor, perilously close to the 

 main entrance, contains over a thousand gold and silver 

 coins, some dating back to the Saka and Gupta dynasties. 

 The lone security guard doubles as office peon, serving 

 tea and running errands.

 Among the inaccessible items are 

 the only copy of Shreekrishna Kirtana, the oldest 

 available example of the Bengali script, the first illustrated 

 manuscript of Annada Mongol, letters written by Sister 

 Nivedita and Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, and bronze artefacts 

 from the Pala-Sena period.

 While India pats itself on the 

 back for its historical acquisitions and its globally-listed 

 wonders, the work of centuries of civilization lies in shambles 

 in a building on a North Calcutta street.

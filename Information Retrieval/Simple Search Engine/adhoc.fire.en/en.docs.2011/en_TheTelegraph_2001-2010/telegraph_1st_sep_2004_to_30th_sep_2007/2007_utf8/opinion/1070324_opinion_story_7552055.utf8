 Sangeet Ashrams musical evening, Holi Hai, (G.D. Birla Sabhaghar, March 16) featured eminent thumri singers, Dalia Rahut, Purnima Chaudhury and Subhra Guha. Ananda Gopal Bandopadhyay and Subhankar Banerjee provided excellent accompaniment on the tabla, with Rajendra Prasad Banerjee on the harmonium. 

 After the opening remarks by Pandit Vijay Kichlu, Sangeet Vidushi Girija Devi, one of the most the venerated exponents of thumri, commented on certain crucial aspects of semi-classical music. With her characteristic sense of humour, she gently chided excessive display of virtuosity. Too much indulgence in taankari will only make your heads shake, not produce any music, she warned aspiring musicians, while pointing out the importance being informed by a literary tradition in order to capture the sensibility (bhavna) which is essential for a moving interpretation of semi-classical music. This inseparability of a musical tradition from a literary one set the template for the evenings programme. Each of the three singers was acutely sensitive to the way words and melody are interwoven to produce a composite bhavna, the meaning that lies at the core of the song. Their easy familiarity with the linguistic nuances was perfectly wedded to their impeccable musical knowledge, the result being a harmonious interaction between the verbal and musical languages.

 Pandit Vijay Kichlu, noted musicologist and a highly accomplished performer himself, provided a commentary alongside the singing, which gave the evenings performance a historical and sociological framework. He began with a brief history of hori, which is sung to celebrate the festival of Holi, and the various sub-genres that emerge from it hori ki dhamar, hori khayal, nritya ki hori, hori thumri, hori dadra, and finally, chaiti. 

 Subhra Guha began the evenings performance with a demonstration of hori dhamar in raga Hindol, which was followed by Dalia Rahuts hori khayal in Durga. Subsequently Guha sang a series of short hori khayals in ragas Desh, Bihag and Bhairavi, among others. These compositions were sung expertly, but a little too succinctly. The emphasis on brevity and variety at the expense of exposition was unwarranted. A far satisfying result would have been achieved by slightly longer, and fuller, expositions in a couple of judiciously chosen ragas. It only seemed reasonable that instead of having Guha sing most of these compositions, Rahut and Chaudhury should also have sung a few to add variety to the interpretations.

 The first slightly extensive composition came from the veteran, Purnima Chaudhury, who sang a nritya ki hori in raga Khamaj. The lilting melody, set to addha teentaal, was sung vivaciously. Dalia Rahut combined grace and deeply moving bol-banao in her hori thumri in Jhinjhoti, demonstrating the blending of sense and sensibility of which her guru, Girija Devi, had spoken earlier. Chaudhurys hori dadra was also alive with bols enhancing the dramatic quality of the song informed by the spirit of viraha.

 The chaitis, in the penultimate section, included traditional compositions from Bihar and Benaras, sung by Rahut and Chaudhury respectively. Rahuts Bihar ki chaiti, sung in a flawlessly regional pronunciation, conveyed as much of a musical sensibility as a distinctively local flavour. Guhas ghato chaiti was also sung with feeling. The grande finale was a duf ki hori, sung with great vigour and enjoyment, not only by the three artists but also by all of their fellow musicians present on the stage.

 Oh, for a 

new law

 In India, mental health care is being neglected because of the deficiencies in the Mental Health Act. 

 V. Kumara Swamy reports

 Scarred soul: Konkona Sen Sharma played the role of a schizophrenic in 15 Park Avenue 

 Shahanara loved embroidering images of sunflowers and peacocks. Even after 10 years in a mental hospital and another six in a half-way home, she never lost hope of being reunited with her family in Bangladesh, which she had left as a eight-year-old girl. Shahanara was finally united with her mother who accepted her happily despite her illness. 

 Rima (name changed) was not as lucky. Married to an alcoholic, she suffered mental and physical torture. Her mental condition deteriorated slowly and ultimately she ended up in a mental hospital. Despite recovering fully, her son refused to take her back and the law enforcement agencies were of little help. A fully-fit Rima, in her old age, has been left alone. 

In both the cases, the law of the land on mental health was of little help. In fact, if the Mental Health Act, 1987, had been strictly followed, Shahanara would never have been united with her family and would have been forced to spend her life in a mental hospital. In Rimas case, the law is almost silent on the condition of patients who have recovered but whose guardians do not want them back. 

 The Mental Health Act (MHA), 1987, came into force in 1993. It repealed the much criticised Indian Lunacy Act, 1912. The aim of the Act was to consolidate the law relating to mentally ill persons, but many people involved in the field feel that the law has too many lacunae and needs urgent attention. 

 Take the case of discharging patients from mental hospitals. Patients who were admitted by their guardians can be discharged only if their relatives take them back. Most of the guardians dont turn up and such patients are forced to languish in mental hospitals despite being fully fit, says Joyce Siromoni, the founder of Paripurnata, a half-way-home for the mentally ill in Calcutta. 

 Organisations like ours have to go to a higher court and take orders to accommodate the mentally ill. This cant go on forever. There should be a law that takes into account the ground realities, says Siromoni. The court can appoint a voluntary guardian for a patient who is abandoned by the family, but the procedures are so complicated that it is almost impossible to get a guardian appointed, says Debashis Bannerjee, a Calcutta-based human rights lawyer who has fought for the mentally ill. 

 archaic view

 lsquo;The (Mental Health) Act is merely an extension of the Indian Lunacy Act. It is a very custodial law, denying freedom of choice to the mentally disabled rsquo; 

We are still in the colonial age, when the mentally ill were considered dangerous to society. The MHA is a legal document that considers protection of others from the mentally ill more important than the people affected by the disease itself, says Ratnabali Ray, the founder of Anjali, an NGO that works with government mental hospitals in the city and tries to mainstream fully recovered patients. 

 I feel the Act is merely an extension of the Indian Lunacy Act. It is a very custodial law, denying freedom of choice to the mentally disabled, says Chaitali Shetty, a social worker with the Chennai-based NGO, The Banyan. 

 The law appoints the state as the guardian of the mentally ill and this doesnt go down well with the organisations working in the sector. The state itself is breaking the laws. The Supreme Court guidelines which were issued soon after the Erawadi tragedy in 2001 have not been implemented so far, says Ray. 

 When a fire broke out at a mental health institution at Erawadi, Tamil Nadu, around 30 inmates died as they were chained to poles or beds and could not escape. The Supreme Court took notice of it and issued various guidelines, but not many state governments have taken heed. 

 The Courts order of 2002 to have at least one mental hospital like the Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) in every state capital is yet to be implemented. Take the north- east. There is only one hospital in Tezpur, Assam, for all the seven states and I dont see the situation improving, says Mukul Goswami, the founder of Ashadeep, a Guwahati-based non-governmental organisation that takes care of the mentally ill. 

 And for those in need of emergency care, the law is absolutely silent. Anybody who is picked up from the roadside even if the person is in need of emergency admission to a mental hospital cant be admitted as the law states that a reception order is needed from a judicial magistrate first, which makes the law absolutely redundant, says Bannerjee. 

 According to the Act, there should be one psychiatrist for every 10 mentally ill patients, and two nurses. That is impossible in a country like ours. Even the government hospitals are not maintaining the standards, and moreover, we just have around 4,000 psychiatrists in the whole country, says Goswami. 

 The law is very demanding when it comes to private mental hospitals, according to Dr J.R. Ram, a clinical psychiatrist at the citys Apollo Gleneagles Hospital. The law states that the government shall appoint a committee of five people consisting of an expert in the mental field and others who will visit a private nursing home every month to monitor the care. This is simply not possible on the ground and many reputed hospitals do not enter this field because of the bureaucratic hassles, he says. 

 According to the National Human Rights Report, 2000, 20 to 30 million people appear to need some form of mental health care and according to the National Commission for Women (NCW), five million of these are women. 

 Twenty per cent of all patients in mental hospitals in Calcutta are fully fit to resume their normal life, according to Ray, but because of lack of rehabilitation and post-care treatment, these people are condemned to languish in the hospitals that are no more than jails. Just take a look at our hospitals and the patients. Our mental hospitals look more like jails with iron grills and locks everywhere. The patients are not encouraged to socialise and lead lives like normal human beings. In fact, their basic rights have been violated, says Ray. 

 There is no mention of the word rehabilitation in the Act, except for one instance, that too, pertaining to nursing homes. All over the world, rehabilitation is the buzzword for patients affected by mental diseases. In India, the government is yet to wake up to the reality of mental health, says Dr R.S. Choudhury, former medical superintendent of Calcuttas Pavlov Mental Hospital. 

 Human rights are being violated in a brazen manner and in many cases, the law itself is responsible for these violations, says Siromoni, looking at Shahanaras embroidered image of a peacock that adorns one of the walls in her office. We have given up on the law completely, she says.

 The great betrayal

 Family business 

Sir While numerous girls have continued to face widespread abuse in silence at home, the media has gone on to elaborately celebrate the triumph of Indian women at international beauty pageants and reality shows (Make us boys, cry girls, April 10). Child abuse is a social evil that needs to be dealt with utmost severity, and without beating about the bush. Calling it a matter of concern is a useless euphemism. For years, welfarists have wondered at the rate of school dropouts without for once considering that corporal punishment, leading to physical and mental abuse, could be a factor behind the decline of the number of students. 

 The recent findings reveal nothing new or shocking. Child abuse is a problem that is too complex and layered for the government to control and contain by any quickfix solution. It is imperative that more social scientists, NGOs and activists are involved in the process of framing the appropriate legislation. The media should also investigate the plight of underprivileged children and expose stories of injustice and neglect more regularly. That is the most important way of raising public awareness about the social evil.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is time the Indian society woke up to the fact that sexual predators are found more frequently within the family than outside it. Earlier, children could feel protected by their elders. Today it has become necessary to protect the young from their protectors. One way of preventing child abuse is to make the young distinguish between good and bad intentions. Unfortunately, it is impossible to realize this aim without depriving children of their natural innocence.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It was only a few days ago that certain ministers expressed their doubts about the necessity of introducing sex education in schools. They priggishly denied children the knowledge that would give them the power over their own bodies. Child abuse happens everywhere in the world, but in countries where sex education is mandatory, children can become aware of potential dangers early and take recourse to counselling when they need advice. India is far from implementing such concepts. Sex education in every regional language must be made compulsory in schools to ensure a healthy and happy future for Young India.

 Yours faithfully,

Swati Das, Calcutta

 Sir It is shocking to learn just two days after the revelations of the national survey on child abuse about the way avarice can defeat filial love (Dance relief, till time takes toll, April 11). Admittedly, proper laws are needed to handle parental abuse, but legislation alone cannot be the only solution. The changes should come from within the family, and at every level of social interaction that determines the life of a child. Bapi and Ruma Sarkar deserve to be punished severely for the traumatic life they have inflicted upon their daughter by forcing her to dance and earn money for them.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Having read about the trials of young Suparna Sarkar, it is difficult to believe that the assurance given by her parents to the police would be effective for very long. Sooner or later, the poor girl would again be subjected to all kinds of mental and physical abuse to continue with the same profession. Considering her tender age and vulnerability, it is desirable to keep her away from her parents. Alternatively, a system of constant monitoring of the parental behaviour towards her should be worked out, till she becomes an adult, to ensure that the child can pursue her studies.

 Yours faithfully,

Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir It is alarming how in a developing country like India children are tortured by their parents and elders to serve their vested interests. The atrocious behaviour of Bapi and Ruma Sarkar towards their daughter reveals an extreme form of proprietorship over children. This further reveals how inept our society is in addressing such uncomfortable situations emanating from within the family. With the intervention of the police and the neighbours, Suparnas problem might have been solved temporarily, but ultimately she has to go back to her parents and live with them. Whatever assurance of good behaviour her parents might have given to the police, they cannot be relied upon. Such instances of parental cruelty abound in many middle-class homes. The State has no machinery to monitor and redress such routine abuse. Suparnas misfortune also came in the wake of her fathers dismissal from his job. Given the scandalous exposure of her father in the media, he will probably not be considered for another employment very soon. This might mean that Suparna could be coerced to carry the burden of providing for her family. 

 However, Suparna has an advantage. Since she is a gifted dancer, she might eventually become a famous artist. The fact that she is doing well at school also suggests that she is an intelligent girl who can, given a chance, perform well in her studies. The organizers of local dance programmes where Suparna used to perform regularly should refuse to give her any further contracts. That should force her parents to think of other ways of earning money by themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

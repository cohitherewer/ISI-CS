 CINEMA AND ITS PEOPLE

 For Fawzan Husain, whose exhibition, Silverscreen, is being held at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre (till April 8), Bombays film industry does not represent a world only of glamour. It is also about people, with myriad skills, working hard to put together a film. This is evident from his photographs, many of which capture the relationship between a film and its people. And the people need not always be actors. For instance, in Mr Hot, Mr Cool-2, Husain has turned his lens on a man, probably a helping hand on the sets, looking at three dancing women. One cannot see the womens faces, only their bodies, swaying to an invisible music. There is no desire in the mans gaze, just a look of weariness that comes from watching too many such performances. There is another photograph, Ek Chalis ki Last Local, of a young girl in a short skirt, bending down to tie her lace-up heels. The image, taken from behind, reveals her long, brown legs. Yet, there is nothing erotic or titillating about the picture. It catches a natural posture and turns it into something beautiful. 

 Film-making is not just about people. It is also a process, and quite a chaotic one at that. This inherent disorder is on show in Yun Hota To Kya Hota-3. A group of young boys is seen crowded around a man scribbling something on a notepad. Near him, another man, bearded and in spectacles, looks up into the camera, with half a smile on his lips. Strewn around him are chairs, bits of wire, a basket and empty, crushed packets of cigarettes. There is chaos, but also a sense of contentment, the two primary aspects of creativity.

 Husains show has its share of actors, some of whom are the biggest stars in India. There is a picture of Amitabh Bachchan, sprawled on the ground, staring anxiously in one direction, as if to check whether the take was perfect. Fardeen Khan is photographed resting with a cup of tea, possibly after a gruelling schedule. Significantly, the camera portrays these actors not as stars, but as dedicated performers engaged in a serious task.Yet, this world is not without humour, as visible in Yun Hota To Kya Hota-1(picture). The photograph shows an older woman in the arms of a young, bare-bodied man. Two men, seated behind a prop, watch her and smile, as if sharing a private joke. Husains fascination with the ever-changing sets is apparent. But the pictures of the song-and-dance routine lack the depth of the other images.

 During his stint as a reporter, Husain, apparently, was appalled by the sight of copy-editors butchering articles. This prompted him to take up photography as they could not murder a picture. Perhaps one ought to thank the copy-editors. Without their butchering, Husain would have stuck to his pen and not taken up the camera, which is his real strength.

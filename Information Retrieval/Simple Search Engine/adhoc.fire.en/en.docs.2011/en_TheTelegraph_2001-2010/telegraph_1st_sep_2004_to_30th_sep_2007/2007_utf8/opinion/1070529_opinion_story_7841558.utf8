The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 OUTSIDE THE LAW

 Many law-abiding Calcuttans will have sharply divided feelings about what has been happening in and around the slums in Chetlas Lockgate Bridge area during the last few days. On Saturday, several hundreds of slum-dwellers, most of them women, publicly lynched Pradip Mullick, a local criminal, popularly known as Dom Pradip, convicted of murder, rape and extortion. Mullick had been released on bail after being in jail for several years, and on returning to his neighbourhood to reclaim his control over it, he lost his life to the people especially the women he and his men had kept in terror for years. His killers are now freely celebrating their relief in not having him around any more. The women, one of whom had taken her life recently after being raped by him, are particularly happy. They have been playing a sort of improvised Holi on the streets in their joy, watched over from a distance by the police pickets that have been placed around the fringes of this scene. A form of brutal intimidation, which has been going on for decades in the area, has been dealt with, and for most of its victims, there seems to be no doubt at all that justice has been done.

 Such a bizarre form of collective and violent action can only happen in a situation where the ineffectuality of the police, their disconnection from what the local inhabitants actually feel and want, is absolute. The circumstances are complex. Urban development is changing even the poorest areas of the city. The slums breed petty criminals who grow powerful by extorting money from the many promoters building in the area and then go on to oppress and brutalize the other people in the slums, among whom the women are the worst, and least visible, victims. So, the merrymaking among them now is really the expression of a feeling of bizarre empowerment. Only the absolutely powerless have to resort to such extreme forms of collective action in order to reclaim control over the fundamentals of their existence. The injustice is twofold: first, the direct and daily brutality of the criminals, and second, the protracted indifference and collusion of the police and local politicians sustaining this criminal network. Both together have created a vacuum of lawlessness and vulnerability that occasionally provokes assertions of agency justice at its roughest that become difficult to judge according to the normal values of peaceful civic existence.

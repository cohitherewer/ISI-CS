 CUT BACK ON 

 THE GOODIES 

 MALAFIDE

 Malvika Singh

 Finally, 

 the prime minister spoke of the urgent need for austerity 

 but addressed captains of Indian industry, asking them to 

 cut back, instead of ordering his own government to do 

 the same and thereby set the standard. In the old days, 

 those with money never flaunted it. Indians across the diverse 

 economic and social spectrum lived within their means. Ostentation 

 was seen to be uncivilized, something that only greedy, 

 uncultured Indians indulged in. Charities were part and 

 parcel of family investments. Cultural sophistication and 

 a sense of appropriate behaviour were instilled in children 

 who came from privileged homes. Economic disparities were 

 huge but behind the purdah. Times have changed.

 Today, austerity must begin 

 with those who preach it. The government must, first and 

 foremost, discontinue all perquisites and privileges for 

 members of parliament and of the many arms of the administration 

 octopus. It must cease to give free accommodation, all subsidies 

 for electricity, telephones, staff for private living, also 

 free first-class train travel, club and first-class air 

 travel on the national carriers, free membership of clubs 

 and more. The prime minister must ban all freebies at hotels 

 and restaurants that politicians and government officers 

 openly enjoy with their friends and families. Till the late 

 Eighties, you hardly saw gentlemen of the administration 

 or political stalwarts at embassy parties, entertaining 

 or being entertained at top line hotels. Neither were their 

 wives shopping in fancy boutiques. This new ethic took root 

 in the late Eighties and early Nineties.

 Rule by example

 As more people were brought into 

 the work-hard-get-rich net, the rules of a command economy 

 that needed to be altered to adjust to this change were 

 not rewritten. The politician and bureaucrat, tied down 

 to archaic pay scales, saw in this an enormous possibility 

 of gain across the board, beginning from harassment of 

 the new entrepreneurs, of whom they were envious because 

 there was a shift from one power centre to another more 

 palatable one. The best and brightest had other, more challenging, 

 opportunities in the marketplace. Joining government was 

 the last option. In a desperate effort to retain control, 

 the government machinery began to question every freedom 

 and wrongly interpret the rule-book. Corruption swamped 

 us, stemming from the government. A cleansing can start, 

 but from the root cause the government. Rewrite the rule 

 book for this millennium and cease to rule us with the norms 

 instituted by a colonial power to deal with the natives. 

 That should be the first commandment.

 Then, follow the change in rules 

 and laws with enforcement. Stop corrupt income tax officers 

 from harassing tax-paying citizens. Stop municipalities 

 from extorting monies from those who break zoning and building 

 rules. Stop political kickbacks. Disallow corrupt individuals 

 from ministerial posts. Do not bend to political pressures 

 only to keep a government in the treasury benches. Do not 

 attack hard-earned flamboyance while remaining silent 

 about the unearned ostentation of those who rule us and 

 live off the dole from the private sector. The private sector 

 buys what it wants, pays its electricity and telephone bills 

 from what it earns. Government employees exploit every sector, 

 including the poorest of the poor. Action, not platitudes, 

 is what India needs. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, who led 

 by example, who established comprehensible symbols that 

 defined compassion, inclusive economics and politics, commitment 

 and dialogue, remains fresh in our memory. His methodology, 

 intelligently adjusted to another time and era, needs to 

 be emulated by our rulers. Only then will the sermon be 

 taken seriously. Only then will austerity of mind and soul 

 happen.

 CLOUDS HEAP

 On the first day of the two-day 

 Barsha Utsab organized by Samaroha at Madhusudan Mancha 

 over July 12-13, it was disappointing to find more people 

 sitting on the steps outside than inside the auditorium. 

 The scene was strangely symbolic of the ebbing popularity 

 of Rabindrasangeet today, particularly among younger listeners. 

 Sadly, the quality of music on the first evening did not 

 generate hopes of the picture changing any time soon. The 

 standard rose marginally on the second day.

 This is not to say, however, that 

 all was bleak and grey. In fact, there were a few singers 

 who left room for hope. Such as Debanjan Kundu, whose Mor 

 bhabonare ki haoway matalo and Ami ki gaan gaabo 

 je spoke of a close reading of the poetry of the songs. 

 But for one such satisfying performance, there were below-par 

 ones from Madhuchhanda Ghatak and Basabi Bagchi. Bhaskar 

 Chakraborty lifted the spirit somewhat with his Bohu 

 juger o-paar hotey. Sanghamitra Chakrabortys Puba-haowatey 

 daey dola was well-sung, but her diction in Shangana-gaganey 

 ghora ghanaghata sounded laboured. Subrata Senguptas 

 rich baritone sounded a little unsteady in Chhaya ghonaichhe 

 boney boney, but he recovered in Kotha je udhao 

 holo, only to be overpowered by the tabla in Jete 

 jete ekla pathey. 

 In one of her rare stage appearances 

 these days, Sanghamitra Gupta represented all that is missing 

 from Rabindrasangeet today. To use a tennis analogy, her 

 singing is reminiscent of the subtlety and elegance of Steffi 

 Graf in this age of power tennis. Note-perfect as always, 

 her selection of songs Nibir megher chhaya, Eshechhinu 

 dwarey tabo and Aay aay aay amader anganey 

 emphasized the fact that Tagores repertoire of rain-songs 

 is richer than the few oft-heard ones might lead us to believe. 

 (Half-a-dozen songs were sung by two or more singers in 

 this programme itself.)

 Swastika Mukhopadhyay is another 

 singer of admirable consistency, and her Megher pore 

 megh jomechhe and Amar din phuralo were imbued 

 with the right amount of pathos. Rajyeshwar Bhattacharya 

 was his usual dramatic self in Aji jharer raate tomar 

 abhishar, Abar eshechhe ashadh and Krishnakali 

 ami tarei boli.

 The second evening began with 

 promise, thanks to Suchhanda Ghoshs fine rendering of Nila-anjana-ghana-punja- 

 chhayay and Aji srabon-ghana gahan mohey. 

 But Sucharita Bandopadhyay, Debarati Mitra, Irabati Basu 

 and Mrinmoy Ray failed to build on the good start. Sutapa 

 Haldar (Utal dhara badal jharey, Badal diner 

 pratham kadam phul) has both confidence and a good 

 voice and, unlike many others, can handle the microphone 

 well.

 Achin Mukhopadhyay belongs to 

 the old school which combines melody and drama. By his spirited 

 rendition of the kaharba version of Amar nishith 

 raater badaldhara and Mono mor megher shongee, 

 he salvaged the evening to a great extent. 

 The star attractions of the evening 

 were without doubt Lopamudra Mitra, Monomoy Bhattacharya 

 and Srikanto Acharya. The three (along with Sriradha Bandopadhyay 

 who sang the previous day) are more popular as singers of 

 Bengali modern songs, and as a result, considered somewhat 

 suspect in the puritan world of Rabindrasangeet (with the 

 exception of Srikanto, perhaps, since he has a bona-fide 

 Tagorean training). Given the rather sorry performance from 

 most of the others, their singing made an instant impact 

 most notably, Monomoys E ki gabhir bani and 

 Saghana gahana ratri, Lopamudras Abar eshechhe 

 ashadh, Srikantos Gahana ghana chhailo and 

 Sriradhas Esho go, jwele diye jao. Lopamudras 

 voice sounded stretched in Krishnakali, while Monomoys 

 pronunciation of akash chheye as akass-chheye 

 in Amar priyar chhaya had a jarring effect. One 

 did not feel inclined to look for faults and impurities 

 in their gayaki, simply because they sang to tune. 

 Which is more than can be said about the majority of the 

 artists who sang on the two days.

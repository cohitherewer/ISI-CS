 MAIDS IN WAITING

 Exporting convent-educated brides has long been a successful venture among Indians. Exporting maids, or women domestic workers, trained in government-run industrial institutes, perhaps follows in natural sequence. But the Union labour ministrys plan for training domestic workers has nothing unofficial or implicit about it, unlike the process behind the export of brides. The advanced world needs housemaids. Trained housemaids who know how to handle electronic gadgets and can deal with emergencies would earn a lot more than they do now. They would also be in great demand in the more high-flying urban centres in this country. As an idea, there can be nothing against the plan. Domestic workers are some of the most exploited segments in the informal sector, and their lack of rights as workers and as human beings is a disgrace to the republic. It needs to be asked, though, who is to pay for the training. If the government pays, what would be the admission criteria? The other question is one of time. Even a short training course would mean time off from the jobs the women already have. They would need the assurance of more paying jobs after the course. Would the government handle that? To make the plan work, a detailed programme with responsibilities distributed at every stage would be required. It is not a question of just drafting a syllabus.

 Most women domestic workers are illiterate, or partially literate in their own language. Without being able to read or write, they would remain eminently exploitable, sexually and otherwise, no matter how well they handle the mixer-grinder. It would be a sign of the labour ministrys seriousness if its plan showed itself to be sensitive to the womens backgrounds. On the positive side, training would automatically mean standardization of wages, increments, bonus, leave, maternity leave and so on. That would force a change of mindset among employers as well. But given the numbers of domestic workers, that would be for a few lucky ones. The question of what happens to the rest, the ones who slave away within the country and remain stuck in the cycle of poverty and deprivation, is not even being addressed.

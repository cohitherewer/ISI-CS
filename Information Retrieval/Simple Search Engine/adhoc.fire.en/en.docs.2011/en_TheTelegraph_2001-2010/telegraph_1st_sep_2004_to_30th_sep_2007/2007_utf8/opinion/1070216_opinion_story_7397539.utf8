 STILL SURVIVING

 If politics is the art of survival, Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav seems to have mastered it. His skills already evident when he put together a government in Uttar Pradesh in 2003, having lured away 13 Bahujan Samaj Party legislators have been sharpened with every crisis. He sailed through a vote of confidence earlier this year (at the height of the Nithari controversy), when an ally dumped him, and locked horns with the governor despite being in a constitutionally weak position. The threat posed to his government by the Supreme Courts disqualification of the 13 BSP defectors may once again give him the opportunity to prove his distinct political abilities. Even if the court adds the 27 other BSP rebels, who later joined hands with the Samajwadi Party, to its list of disqualified legislators, the reduction in the total number of seats in the house will enable Mr Yadav to sustain a majority. If only for a few weeks, retaining administrative control is enormously significant for the ruling party before elections. But in thus scraping through, in spite of executive and judicial censure, the UP chief minister will have re-established a democratic violation as norm. The horse-trading and political poaching that have characterized the tenure of each swing-door dispensation in UP make a mockery of the popular will. The incumbent party is as much a part of this charade as the opposition parties. No matter how morally upright Mr Yadavs rivals may consider themselves to be, they too cannot escape the blame. A post-electoral scenario in UP will be no different from what it was in 2003 or in 1997, as far as backroom manipulations are concerned.

 Apart from the legislators and, by extension, the chief minister, there is another figure who stands thoroughly discredited by the apex courts verdict. The court minces no words about the dubious role played by the speaker, Mr Kesri Nath Tripathi, in the matter. Speakers, in Bihar and UP, and more recently in Jharkhand, have repeatedly acted out of their brief. They have mediated in unscrupulous political dealings and grossly interfered in the administration as well. But such eventualities cannot be ruled out where constitutional posts, including the governors, are not divested of their political colour. If democracy has to work, such assignments cannot be treated as sinecures for loyalists who continue to serve their partys interests.

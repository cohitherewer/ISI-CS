 STOP YOURSELF

 Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has been watching too much television again. Unfortunately, some would say, that is his job or that is what he seems to have reduced his job to. The consequences of this are always annoying, and sometimes comical. This time, he has appealed to news channels to report the situation in Rajasthan with some restraint. Mr Das Munshis favourite word for this is self-censorship, with its vaguely Gandhian ring. However, his illustration of how restraint might be practised in this specific instance has been expectedly rather mindless: do not use terms like Meenas and Gujjars. That is really no help at all. But why, in the first place, should the information and broadcasting minister be turned to for help in news reporting? And to get to the very first principles, why should there be such a minister at all? The Indian democracy is mature and modern enough to self-censor itself (tautology intended) without needing a politician with prelapsarian notions of morality for help.

 Mr Das Munshis latest piece of advice on Rajasthan could have been ignored as innocuous had he not been going about actually banning TV programmes. Besides, a draft content code doing the rounds in the I amp;B ministry has drawn up a whole web of rules and categories which might affect every kind of programme on TV. The principles behind such a code are a combination of morality, political insecurity and old-fashioned notions of good and evil that could come in the way of free expression in the most significant way. Self-censorship figures prominently in this draft too, and Mr Das Munshi has come upon this unique paradox of self-censorship according to the ministrys guidelines. All this could have been dismissed as silliness had he not had the powers to hinder free expression on television in a very real sense. But he does have the powers to do so. From The Da Vinci Code to the content code, Mr Das Munshi has repeatedly hit upon the surest way to get on adult nerves in the name of public good.

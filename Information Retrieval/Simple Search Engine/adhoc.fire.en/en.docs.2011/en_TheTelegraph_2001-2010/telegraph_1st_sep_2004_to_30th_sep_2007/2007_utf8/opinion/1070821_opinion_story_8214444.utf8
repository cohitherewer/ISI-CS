 TIME TO MOVE APART

 MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh

 It beats the imagination why Prakash Karat and his party do not want India to take the next two steps in the nuclear engagement with the United States of America. The next steps are essential because they engage India with many more countries, diluting the hitherto isolation of our people from the larger world. Surely, we can be confident of our ability to transact what is the best deal for us and continue to ensure, through democratic negotiations, that we are not taken for a ride or exploited. Thankfully, the Congress does not owe any allegiance to a political party overseas like some other Indian political parties. It represents itself and is elected for what it professes to want to do.

 When China engaged with Pakistan and shared technology and much more, it did so to negate and weaken Indias geo-political position in the region. Yes, it is as simple as that even though you could give it a different intellectual veneer. As many editorials have recently spelt out, China would not want India to be part of a counter-club because it would, by definition, make the two countries competitors for the top slot in the area. It was only on one television channel that Kapil Sibal cogently argued with Arun Jaitley and others, showing how uninformed their take was on the various issues they have objected to. Sibal spelt out the other strengths of the deal and the possible partnerships and sharing of expertise and technology. Needless to say, the anchor of the show came across as not having read the 123 document, which happens to be on the net! That is how pathetic the debate has been thus far.

 Face reality

 One needs to say that the Congress and the UPA high command have been extremely inept in making sure that the elements of the deal were articulated and presented through the media to the country. The exclusive manner in which the government and their babus operate is what paints the ruling coalition into a corner each time it takes an unusual policy initiative or a strong decision that is bound to trigger a volatile response from the Left and others. This invariably leads to a controversy where the little box is used to vent political venom and endless personal diatribes. All this is of little consequence and the serious questions raised get diluted and misreported. Presenting its position positively has been a continuing problem for the Congress. Its handling of the dissemination of information has been abysmal. When it is in a real mess, it calls upon Kapil Sibal to bail it out. Speaking on the deal on Times Now, Sibal silenced the opposing panelists by being fully aware of the small print, unlike the others.

 The Congress and the Left are like oil and water, unable to come together. The fact that the UPA has shown concern and addressed issues that were hitherto neglected, that compelled a pattern of growth that was neither inclusive nor as egalitarian as it could have been, made the Left agree to be a reluctant ally. It suited the Left, which has never had it so good on the national stage. Before the relationship becomes graceless and completely untenable, the two should part company regardless of the immediate consequences.

 And, if that means mid-term elections, so be it. I am always suspicious of leaders who shy away from an early poll when the political reality demands it. Many questions pop up in my mind. Have they not delivered the goods and are therefore terrified to face the people and be voted out? Do they want to cling on to the chair and all its perks for as long as they can? Are they guilty of non-performance and desperate to duck and delay their day of reckoning? Surely, if one is effective, competent and believes in democracy, fighting to win an election is an endorsement that establishes ones legitimacy in the public space. Why this fear of facing the people?

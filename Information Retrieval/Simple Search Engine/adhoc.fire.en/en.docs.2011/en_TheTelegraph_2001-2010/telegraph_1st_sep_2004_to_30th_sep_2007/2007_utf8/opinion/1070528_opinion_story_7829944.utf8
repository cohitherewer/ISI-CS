 EXPELLED FROM PARADISE

 Gwynne Dyer

 One should never underestimate the cunning and treachery of the British government. But the British courts are another matter. The Chagos Islanders are finally going home after 40 years of enforced exile. Unless,of course, the British government appeals the court ruling yet again. We must surely be very tough about this, wrote Sir Paul Gore-Booth, a senior official at the Foreign Office, as the plan to expel the 2,000 Chagos Islanders from their homes was taking shape in 1966. The object of the exercise is to get some rocks which will remain ours ...There will be no indigenous population except seagulls. It was in the depths of the Cold War, and the US wanted an air and naval base in the Indian Ocean. Britain, ever the loyal sidekick, offered Diego Garcia, the largest of the 65 coral atolls that make up the Chagos archipelago. It separated the isolated islands from Mauritius, which was about to gain independence, and declared them the British Indian Ocean Territory. But the US didnt want a population problem at its new base, so the Foreign Office got to work on removing the population.

 Chagossians were encouraged to visit Mauritius or other Indian Ocean islands and then not allowed back. As American troops moved in, they were drawn into the campaign to scare the islanders into leaving: At one point, US soldiers rounded up their dogs and gassed them. In the end, those islanders who still stubbornly clung to their homes were simply loaded onto ships and dumped on the waterfront of Port Louis, Mauritius,where they have subsisted in abject poverty ever since. It was a shameful act of treachery and in 2000 a British court declared that the expulsion had been unlawful and ordered the British government to let the islanders go home.

 Home again

 The judge in the case, Justice Gibbs, stressed that the cruelty with which the Chagossians had been treated was not simply due to different standards of behaviour in a by-gone past. The impression on right-thinking people upon reading (the Foreign Office correspondence) would have been similar then as now. After that crushing legal rebuke to the government, the Chagossians probably would have gone home in due course except for 9/11.

 Suddenly, Diego Garcia stopped being a military backwater and became a key base for US aircraft, bombing Afghanistan, bombing Iraq, or just flying prisoners untraceably around the planet. In the post-2001 mania for security, the US and British governments started insisting that it would not be safe to have the original inhabitants return even to islands a hundred kilometres from Diego Garcia. 

 Utter nonsense, of course. The British Foreign Secretary, the late Robin Cook, felt so sorry for the Chagossians that he arranged to grant them British citizenship. But once Cook had resigned in protest against the plan to invade Iraq, the Blair government moved swiftly, issuing an order in council in 2004 to block the islanders return on security grounds. Back to the courts, and in 2006 three High Court judges ruled that the decree was illegitimate. The British government, which gave the US a veto on who is allowed on the islands in the 1966 agreement setting up the base, was trapped between its commitments to its senior ally and its duty to obey British law, so it appealed the ruling. On May 23, the Court of Appeal found the British government guilty of abuse of power and ordered it to let the islanders go home.

 If Tony Blair were still running the show, he would doubtless try to appeal the court ruling to the House of Lords rather than defy his friends in the Bush administration, but Gordon Brown, his successor, may find this a modest way to demonstrate his relative independence from the White House. Many, who were expelled from paradise years ago, have died waiting, but the descendants may finally be going home.

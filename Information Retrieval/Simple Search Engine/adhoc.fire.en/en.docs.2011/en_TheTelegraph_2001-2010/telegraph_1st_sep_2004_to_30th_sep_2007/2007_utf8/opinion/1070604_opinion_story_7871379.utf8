The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FOR ITS OWN SAKE

 Is George W. Bushs G-8 turnaround on climate change a turnaround at all? And where does this leave India in all this? The United States of America had refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol or even accept the scientific evidence that global warming is predominantly caused by human activity. But it suddenly sees itself now as the world leader in setting and monitoring a long-term goal through a framework involving 15 influential countries, including India and China. This framework would conform to the United Nations framework convention on climate change and take over when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. Thus, in one stroke, the president shows himself as taking climate change seriously, persists in rejecting the European framework (with its emphasis on cutting emissions and carbon trading), and puts himself in a position from which he can call the shots. He can now sell clean energy to the rest of the world. Naturally, the world is sceptical, and the developing countries singled out by Mr Bush, India and China, are unwilling to be made to share responsibility with the US for global warming.

 However, Indias resistance to Mr Bushs pressures should not become an excuse for refusing to confront its own urgent need for reviewing existing energy policies. The emergency in India has got much less to do with Mr Bush and the world than with the health and safety of its own citizens. And attending to the latter will automatically also go a long way towards meeting the formers demands. The problems are local and specific: enforcing auto-emission rules, converting to LPG, banning plastic bags, upgrading urban and industrial waste disposal, protecting the green cover, preventing the contamination of drinking water. The criminal inefficiency, negligence, ignorance and corruption that prevail in India have to be addressed and transformed into scrupulous action. For this to happen, the State as well as ordinary Indians must think and act responsibly. This change should be self-motivated and self-determined, and any resonance with Mr Bushs framework should be purely incidental.

 ANGEL ON A CAR

 An ability to look beyond ones own self-interest is a quality attained by a few. There is no denying that a car-manufacturing unit at Singur will further Mr Ratan Tatas business interests. The setting up of that unit does not entail his involvement in what has become a very shoddy and bloody affair. Yet Mr Tata, behaving as an industrialist of his stature and lineage should, has made the offer to have a dialogue with any reasonable political party. He admitted that, in an ideal situation, he should not actually be involved in a process that has unfortunately taken a grim political colouring. Mr Tatas openness to have a dialogue with even those political forces opposed to his car factory in Singur is not only evidence of his grace, but it is also a statement of his commitment to the industrial growth of West Bengal. His gesture is unique because of the absence of rancour and the ring of sincerity it carries. He has made himself an exemplar in public life.

 Mr Tatas position is in sharp contrast to those who are hell-bent on stopping an industrial unit in Singur. Ms Mamata Banerjee, who leads and incites the violence, has made herself deaf to dialogue. From the very beginning, she has chosen the path of agitation, protest and destruction. Her views and her opposition to the policies of the government have a place in a democratic polity, and there exist fora where those views can be presented. Ms Banerjee chose to spurn those democratic platforms, and decided to take to the streets and pursue an agenda of violence and destruction. Under these circumstances, Mr Tatas use of the phrase, reasonable political party, acquires a certain salience. Ms Banerjees attitudes and actions have been far from reasonable, by any definition of the word. She has been requested to come to the discussion table by many, including the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and the governor of West Bengal, Mr Gopal Krishna Gandhi. All such appeals have been in vain. It will not be unfair to assume that her response to Mr Tatas offer will be informed by the same unreasonableness that has been the hallmark of all her actions so far. Mr Tatas grace and generosity of spirit provide Mr Bhattacharjee with another window of opportunity to reiterate the importance of dialogue and debate in a democracy. The investment of money will follow Mr Bhattacharjees greater investment in dialogue and reason.

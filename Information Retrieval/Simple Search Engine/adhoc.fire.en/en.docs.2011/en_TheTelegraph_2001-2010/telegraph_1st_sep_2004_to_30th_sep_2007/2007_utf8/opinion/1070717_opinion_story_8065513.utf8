 KILLING BLUNDER

 It is bad enough for anyone to become a captive of some militant group in the North-east. The bizarre case of the abduction and murder of the Food Corporation of India official, P.C. Ram, now suggests that things could be worse with a rescue operation by the police. The role of the Assam police in this particular case is simply scandalous. They not only failed to save Rams life, but also sought to hide the failure with laughable excuses. But it is not enough for the chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, to fume at the polices failure. He would do better to ask himself why the police behaved the way they did. After all, the controversies surrounding Rams death show his government in a poor light. This was not the first tragedy of this kind in Assam. Given the governments growing incompetence in handling the threat posed by the United Liberation Front of Asom, the fear is that this may not be the last either. There is a strong case for handing over the inquiry into Rams murder to the Central Bureau of Investigation. And, one of the first things the CBI should try to unravel is how the police botched up the rescue operation. 

 Ironically, the people of Assam voted Mr Gogoi to power for two successive terms. This has not happened in the state for a long time. Obviously, the people had hoped that he would save the state from sliding into anarchy. The promise that his first government had shown in realizing that hope seems to be largely missing at present. The chief minister appears to be presiding over a political and administrative vacuum. True, the state police alone cannot combat the Ulfas challenge. But Mr Gogoi cannot complain that he does not have the support he needs from the Centre. On the contrary, the support he gets from the army and the para-military forces is not matched by the states political will to tackle the challenge. Worse still, the state government and the army are known to have worked at cross purposes from time to time. In fact, his government seems to be clueless about its job after the peace moves initiated by some non-government groups failed. If the Ulfa has grown bolder in recent weeks, it is largely due to the states inept handling of the situation. The larger issues of Assams economy and security are linked to the battle against the Ulfa. Unfortunately, the impression is gaining ground that the militants, and not the government and its agencies, rule the blighted state.

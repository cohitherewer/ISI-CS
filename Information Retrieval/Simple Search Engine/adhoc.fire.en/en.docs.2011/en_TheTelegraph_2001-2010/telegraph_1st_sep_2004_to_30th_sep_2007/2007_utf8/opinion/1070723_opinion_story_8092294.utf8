 ABSURD CODE

 The information and broadcasting ministry has finally come clean about its regulatory instincts when it comes to the broadcasting sector. A draft content code was doing the rounds for a while, the reaction to which, especially from private television channels, was deeply hostile. It has now been officially released and the people who are going to be affected by it remain just as displeased. A content code drawn up and enforced by the government can be nothing but an infantilizing hindrance for everybody in the news and entertainment industry. It goes against the principles of a free market as well as a mature democracy in trying to regulate both the commercial and editorial aspects of TV broadcasting.

 The absurd notion on which this code is based is that of the government providing broadcasters with self-regulation guidelines. By this logic, broadcasters will, of course, regulate themselves, but the government will provide the rules according to which they must do so. This comes with its own hierarchy of regulators. It will not be enough, for instance, for channels to have their senior editorial boards, but they must also have one or more content auditors who would keep an eye on these editorial decisions. Moreover, the guidelines regarding content are written down in an all-encompassing language that might be interpreted in any way, making it possible to put in place all kinds of censorship. News coverage becomes particularly tricky here. During the recent unrest in Rajasthan, the ministry had issued guidelines do not use terms like Meenas and Gujjars, for example which have now been codified. Nothing that might create public panic might be aired. Notions of the violation of privacy, of good taste in reporting and of what might be viewed (and when) by adults and not by children are, predictably, part of these regulations as well. This code, together with the reaction to it, does not bode well for the proposed broadcasting bill. It does not bode well for democracy either.

 KEEP THE FLAG FLYING

 The national flag may be held in high esteem but most Indians are unaware of the dos and don rsquo;ts pertaining to its display. Vishnupriya Sengupta reports

 What binds Mandira Bedi, Sachin Tendulkar, Malini Ramani and Mataji Nirmala Devi? The Indian tricolour, of course. 

 A matter of national pride and patriotism, the national flag is held in high esteem by every single Indian. And as most of us are aware, disrespect shown to it is a punishable offence. In spite of that, most Indians, it appears, are unaware of the dos and donts pertaining to the hoisting or display of the tricolour and are happily oblivious of the connotations of the expression Indian national flag. 

 More than 88 Indians among 100 who were quizzed had no answer to what the national flag denoted. Eight per cent hemmed and hawed while only a mere four per cent were actually aware that the expression Indian national flag includes according to the book of law any picture, painting, drawing or photograph or other visible representation of the Indian national flag or any part or parts thereof made of any substance or represented on any substance. 

 We claim to be patriotic but still fail to realise what it is that defines patriotism in our country, says social activist Sudakshina Basu. There are so many who dont even know the significance of the three colours of our flag. Obviously you cant expect them to know the laws pertaining to the display or hoisting of the flag, leave alone abide by them, she says pointedly. 

 Seven years ago, designer Malini Ramani committed a punishable offence which came under the purview of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. Ramani used horizontal strips of orange, white and green and a blue wheel resembling the Indian tricolour for a strappy knee-length dress which was showcased at the India Fashion Week. At that time the Act forbade the use of the national flag as a portion of a costume or uniform of any description. 

 Recently, Bedi and Tendulkar were pulled up for their apparent show of disrespect to the tricolour. In her overzealous bid to be sporty, Bedi sported the tricolour below her waist on her flagship saree on the eve of the World Cup. Tendulkar, on the other hand, was accused of running a knife through it in the form of a cake in the presence of the Indian high commissioner in Jamaica. 

 But it was Nirmala Devi known for her Sahaj Yoga techniques who took the cake. In March this year, photographs of Nirmala Devi seated on a chair with the tricolour at her feet during an Independence Day programme held abroad were circulated on the social networking site Orkut. Going by the amendments introduced in 2003 to the 1971 Act which state clearly, that it is disrespectful to allow the national flag to touch the ground or the floor or trail in water intentionally or even put any kind of inscription upon it or use it to cover a statue or a monument or a speakers desk or a speakers platform Nirmala Devis case made for a punishable offence. 

 The repercussions were expected. Citizens didnt hesitate to voice their indignation on citizenexpress.com. Influential people can escape punishment despite committing serious offences, protested an angry youngster. Two days later Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga Trust apologised through an e-mail addressed to Asian News International. Possibly, at an Independence Day function held abroad, some foreigner Sahaja Yogi brought our (national) flag and without meaning any disrespect, kept it on the ground. The flag was respectfully removed immediately on being noticed, it said. 

 In countries like the US, the courts have upheld the right to burn the national flag as a mark of protest. It can also be used either on undergarments or on clothing worn below the waist, such as shorts, jeans or swimming trunks. But not in India. It was only after Congress MP Naveen Jindal petitioned the court that the Supreme Court held that a citizen had the right to fly the national flag freely, giving it due respect and dignity. Following the judgement passed on January 23, 2004, citizens took the liberty of hoisting the flag at their homes, workplaces or even placing it in their cars but in accordance with certain guidelines. 

 Subsequent to the Ramani fiasco in 2000, and with Tendulkar sporting the tricolour on his helmet in World Cup 2003 (after seeking due permission) citizens, especially sportspersons, made an appeal to express their love for the national flag by displaying it on their dresses, headgear, T-shirts and vests in a respectable manner. After much deliberation, on December 6, 2005, the Prevention of Insults to National Honour (Amendment) Bill 2005 was passed by the Lok Sabha and six days later, by the Rajya Sabha. 

 Once the amendments were made to Explanation 4(e) of Section 2 of the Act, Indian citizens were allowed to use the national flag on their costumes, uniforms or accessory of any description in a respectable manner. The only safeguard was the national flag shall not be used as a portion of a costume, uniform or accessory of any description worn below the waist of any person. Nor would it be used by way of embroidering or printing in items of daily use such as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, undergarments or any dress material. It also meant that one could sport the tricolour on a bandanna or a wristband but not on an ankle-band. 

 The move was viewed in favourable light. As sociologist Bineeta Ghosh notes, It was good to have done away with the stringency. But it is equally important to create an awareness about the amended Act so that any faux pas can be avoided. 

 Most lawyers, however, are of the view that the recent cases against Bedi and Tendulkar are not tenable in a court of law. Some people file such cases for cheap publicity and to draw attention but in reality such cases hardly hold any water, says Prasun Mukherjee, a practicing lawyer at Calcutta High Court. 

 The amended Act states clearly, Whoever in any public place or any other place within public view burns, mutilates, defaces, defiles, disfigures, destroys, tramples upon or otherwise shows disrespect to or brings into contempt (whether by words either spoken, or written or by acts) the Indian national flag or any part thereof is punishable with imprisonment up to three years or with fine or both. 

 Earlier, a fine of Rs 500 was imposed on any person who wanted to avoid imprisonment for insulting the national flag. That has now been increased to Rs 5,000. The Act also underlines, Whoever having already been convicted of an offence under Section 2 is again convicted of any such offence shall be punishable for the second and for every subsequent offence, with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year. 

 But to date, there has hardly been a case except perhaps the Ramani case that has been tenable in a court of law. Nonetheless, it is perhaps better to be safe than sorry.

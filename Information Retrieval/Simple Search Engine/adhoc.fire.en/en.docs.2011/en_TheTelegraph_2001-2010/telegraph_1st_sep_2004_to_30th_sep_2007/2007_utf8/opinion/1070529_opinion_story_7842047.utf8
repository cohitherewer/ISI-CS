 OUT OF FLIGHT AND OUT OF MIND

 RETIRED HURT

 A depleted IAF is losing its edge over its rivals in Indias neighbourhood

 It appears to be a season of retirement for the frontline fighters of the Indian Air Force. First to gowas the MiG-25 Foxbat of 102 Squadron, based in Bareilly, which bid adieu on May 1, 2006. An aircraft with a high-altitude photo reconnaissance capacity, its retirement reduced the IAFs advantage in intelligence gathering and aerial reconnaissance. The main reasons for its retirement were high maintenance cost and lack of spare parts. The MiG-25R, however, did not leave behind any worthy successor to match its spectacular performance of 25 years.

 This May-Day retirement was followed by the march of its 224 Squadron, consisting of 36 MiG-23MF, on March 20, 2007. Nicknamed Warlord, the original 36 MiG-23MFs began flying on July 4, 1983 at Adampur and logged 32,581 flying hours at the end of the day. Its main purpose was to counter the Pakistani Air Forces F-16 fighters. Significantly, the MiG-23 MF was retired for the same reason as the MiG-25. These aircraft were important assets of the IAF.

 Next came the turn of the Agra-based English Electric Canberra of 106 Squadron, after fifty years of service to the nation. The Canberras excelled in tactical bombing, electronic warfare, maritime strike, high-altitude strategic reconnaissance and target-towing when visual flight rules were still the norm and automation of aircraft had its limitations. The former Air Chief Marshal, S. Krishnaswamy, has acknowledged the role of the Canberra thus: We created an electronic warfare squadron and used to go deep into Pakistan and would jam enemy radars and collect information about their systems. But Canberra too had a fall from 40,000 ft when the Pakistanis shot down one such sortie and captured the Group Captain in the Sixties. Once more, economics and the unavailability of spare parts are responsible for the aircrafts departure.

 These retirements about 50 aircraft from the IAFs inventory of 849 combat-capable aircraft (according to The Military Balance, 2007), stresses the need for their urgent replenishment. After all, the departure of the MiG-25s (reconnaissance), the Canberras (photo reconnaissance) and the MiG-23MFs (air defence), seems to have severely depleted the operational strength of the IAF. 

 However, a damaging report in Janes Defence Weekly, titled Industry fears Indian MRCA (multi-role combat aircraft) may never emerge (April 18) , says that US and European companies are re-evaluating the Indian Air Forces much-anticipated tender for 126 MRCA: a programme that some now see as a mirage far in the distance rather than a near term possibility. 

 Although this report appears somewhat biased and speculative, Lockheed Martin, one of the most optimistic of American bidders for the Indian MRCA, seems disappointed, as obsolescence in the fighter market is faster than that in the non-defence industry.

 The indications are obvious. A faster bid for the IAF will ensure an enhanced service life of the F-16 series, thereby keeping the technology of the Sixties and Seventies afloat in the 21st century and helping a developing nations air force. The flip side of the story could also be an unbridgeable technological gap for New Delhi as Indias neighbours seem to have gone ahead with fleet replacement and modernization. 

 Although the Janes report may be construed in certain quarters as pressure tactics by the Western armament industry the depletion of front-line defence aircraft is a reality faced by the IAF pilots still flying their old machines.

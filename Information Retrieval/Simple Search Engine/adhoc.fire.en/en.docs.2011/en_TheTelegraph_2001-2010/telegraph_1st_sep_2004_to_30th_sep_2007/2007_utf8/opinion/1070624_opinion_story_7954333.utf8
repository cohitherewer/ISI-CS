 THE KEY OF 

 DREAMS 

 - Roussel, the Surrealists, Arun Kolatkar and unseen Africa 

 TELLING 

 TALES 

 AMIT CHAUDHURI

 Magritte, The 

 Key of Dreams 

 About seven years ago, I noticed 

 a longish review in the pages of the Times Literary Supplement. 

 What drew my attention to it was not its subject, an obscure 

 French writer called Raymond Roussel, but the author of 

 the book under review, the English poet, Mark Ford, whom 

 I knew slightly. Relieved it was a positive review, I was, 

 however, bemused by Roussel, a writer of whom not only I, 

 but, it seemed, many others were not aware. Roussel appeared 

 to be another one of Fords eccentric, subterranean, un-English 

 preoccupations; for Ford was a devotee of the American poet 

 John Ashbery, whose ironic ludic-plangent style was more 

 of a minority taste in Britain than falafel or the 

 nouveau roman. 

 And yet Roussels reputation had 

 been growing. Born in 1877 into luxury and to a fairly odd 

 mother (who carried a coffin with her on her travels in 

 case she died in transit), more a curiosity who occasionally 

 attracted lavish praise from famous writers than ever the 

 famous writer he himself longed to be, Roussel was taken 

 up, unsurprisingly, as a minor cult by the Surrealists, 

 whose project he, on his part, was not overly taken with. 

 Unsurprising, because theres an intransigent note of numinous 

 solemnity to the bizarrely playful methods Roussel used 

 in his composition bizarre especially to contemporary 

 French critics just as his life seems to be a mixture 

 of comic punctiliousness and mysterious unfulfilment. The 

 tranquil poise of impossible juxtapositions: this might 

 be one of the goals of Roussels life and his writing, as 

 well as the subject of many of the photographs he left behind, 

 starting with the picture of the three-year-old Roussel 

 upon a swan, hands innocently encircling its slender neck, 

 or, a little older, in Turkish costume, pretending to smoke, 

 as Fords caption reads, a pipe. 

 Roussels writing depended, as 

 he put it in How I Wrote Certain Of My Books, on 

 a very special method. The French word translated here 

 as method is procd, and its a term that, by now, 

 has come to be associated in certain circles with Roussels 

 comical-mystical endeavour. At the heart of the procd 

 lies the pun, says Ford. The early stories begin and end 

 with phrases that are identical except for a single letter, 

 but where each major word is used in a different sense. 

 The procd probably came to Roussel with two sentences, 

 Les lettres du blanc sur les bandes du vieux billard, 

 and the near-identical les lettres du blanc sur les 

 bandes du vieux pillard. Roussel decided, or, as it 

 were, was directed, to begin a story with the first sentence, 

 which means the letters [of the alphabet] in white chalk 

 on the cushions of the old billiard table, and conclude 

 it with the second, which, with the b in the last word 

 transmogrified into a p, means the letters sent by the 

 white man about the hordes of the old plunderer. One can 

 see why the Surrealists would have liked the procd, emerging 

 straight-faced as it does from the scientism of the 19th 

 century, with its complete investment in order and logic, 

 while also undermining that scientism somewhat disreputably. 

 Exactly the same thing, I suppose, could be said about psychoanalysis, 

 its own procd or method, and its relationship to the recognized 

 sciences.

 Ones also struck by the difference 

 between the Rousselian, even the Surrealist, game or method, 

 and the narrative play of much of post-modern writing, which 

 seldom loses its moorings in the histories of the New World 

 and of colonialism. For the Surrealists, the great tension, 

 as in their experiments with automatic writing, is between 

 bourgeois artifice and predictability on the one hand, and 

 chance, or even fate, on the other: theres a notable faith 

 in the unknown that the future will inexorably throw up. 

 For Roussel and the Surrealists, chance is the great begetter, 

 and its to chance fates mundane but nevertheless pregnant 

 incarnation they must attend, and to its disruption of 

 the inevitability that socialization visits upon us: this 

 is, for instance, what Magrittes painting, The Key of 

 Dreams, is about.

 The one Indian writer in English 

 I can think of who dabbled intriguingly in a sort of procd 

 in his early work is the bilingual Arun Kolatkar. A sui 

 generis song Kolatkar composed in the early Seventies 

 (before hed embarked on the poem-sequence Jejuri, 

 and when he still entertained hopes of being a rock musician) 

 begins with a line which he lifted from a typed message 

 being distributed by an educated beggar on a train: I am 

 a poor man from a poor land. This line clearly suggested 

 to Kolatkar an opening on to a domain whose meaning was 

 quite distinct from the lines original intention: for his 

 song is at once a parody of a Baul devotional, and a sales 

 pitch for Indian rock music to a transcontinental record 

 producer. Then there are the Marathi poems in which Kolatkar 

 began to experiment with Bombay Hindi, often using, as Arvind 

 Krishna Mehrotra pointed out to me, what Marcel Duchamp 

 called readymades or found objects. The line in the 

 beggars message is a found object; so is the last line 

 of the poem Kolatkar himself translated as Biograph, Cant 

 you see where you going you m*****f****r? whose original 

 (Dikhta nahin m****ch*d dikhta nahin?) Kolatkar 

 must have heard many times, as I have, from the mouths of 

 Bombays taxi and bus drivers. Biograph is about an unfortunate 

 everyman, Mr Nene; and, at some point, Kolatkar realized 

 that Dikhta nahin m****ch*d is an unforgiving philosophical 

 pun, containing both an invective and a vision of existence, 

 and that it could be used both as a summation of a life 

 and the conclusion of a poem: in other words, as a procd. 

 The procd, then, is superficially 

 akin to, but significantly unlike, the Jamesian done 

 , which, for the novelist, was a banal instant or stimulus 

 that suddenly provided him with an opportunity to explore 

 imaginary narrative terrain. The procd is somewhat different, 

 in that it hints not only at imaginative possibility, but 

 toward a formal one; for Roussel and Kolatkar, the procd, 

 or self-imposed method, leads not only to the birth of 

 a new story or poem, but to the necessity of fresh formal 

 construction. 

 My own interest in Roussel has 

 grown surreptitiously, because, really, I was charmed by 

 the titles of his books, especially Impressions of Africa 

 and New Impressions of Africa. What held me, in particular, 

 was the fact that Roussel had never been to equatorial Africa, 

 the setting of that first novel; this was instructive, 

 but in what way, I couldnt pinpoint. It reminded me of 

 my late uncles enthusiasm for Chander Pahar; his 

 contradictory satisfaction at the fact that Bibhutibhusan 

 Bandyopadhyay had never seen Africa. Roussel travelled, 

 of course; he even went to Egypt and came to India; but, 

 like the procd, his travels are about the bathos of the 

 idea of onward movement. The staged photographs of Roussel 

 in exotic locations are like Surrealist forerunners of the 

 tourists experience of foreignness, where people make a 

 studio, a microcosm, of wherever they happen to be, turning 

 a scene into a backdrop for their figures. Often, Roussel 

 visited these places in a roulette, a luxurious, caravan-like 

 vehicle, in which he was accompanied and attended to by 

 his staff, and from which he hardly emerged.

 Roussel came back to me during 

 my recent trip to the Paris Book Fair; not just because 

 he was from Paris, but because the visit was oddly Rousselian. 

 By the time it ended, it occurred to me that, in Paris after 

 eleven years, I had seen almost nothing of the city. There 

 was the hotel room; then the coach from the hotel to the 

 aerodrome-like building that hosted the Fair; then back 

 to the hotel again: all this punctuated by lunches, readings, 

 gossip, dinner. Soon, I realized that there were other writers 

 whod habituated themselves to, and probably profited from, 

 this peculiar notion of travel. The historian, Mushirul 

 Hasan, told me he was having a wonderful time in Paris. 

 What do you do? I asked. I stay in my hotel room and 

 dictate my new chapter, he said. In the coach, the Eiffel 

 Tower often followed us about, augmenting the sense of interiority; 

 reduced and reproduced infinitely, it has become a piece 

 of furniture. Who is it who said, observed Ananthamurthy 

 suddenly from the seat in front of me, that to escape the 

 Eiffel Tower you have to go inside it? He ruminated for 

 a few moments, as the lighted geometric shape waited patiently. 

 I think it was Barthes, he said finally, with his sweet 

 sage-like smile.

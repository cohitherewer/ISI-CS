 ROYALISTS FISH IN TERAI TROUBLE

 Twenty-Twenty 

 Bharat Bhushan

 Madhesi Janadhikar Forum activists demonstrate in Jaleswor, Mahottari

 The April-2006 uprising in Nepal had three objectives: a peaceful resolution of the Maoist insurgency; an end to the kings autocratic rule; and the restructuring of the Nepalese state.While the first aim of the popular uprising has virtually been achieved, it is the fate of the monarchy and the restructuring of the state, which continue to pose major political challenges. Although in its death throes, the Nepalese monarchy is making a last ditch effort for survival. There are indications that the traditionally marginalized people of the Terai or Madhya-desh (Madhesis) are being used to create instability in the country in the hope of preventing the constituent assembly elections. 

 Nepals Terai is on fire. There have been disturbances in Siraha, Saptari, Janakpur, Biratnagar, Inaruwa, Birganj, Rautahat, Bara and other districts of the Terai adjoining the Indian border. Sectarian violence is being fomented all over the Terai between the Paharis (inhabitants of the hills) and the Madhesis. The statues of the democratic movement B.P. Koirala, Manmohan Adhikary and Ganesh Mansingh are being deliberately targeted and damaged. In Rautahat, the ancestral house of Madhav Kumar Nepal, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist), was set on fire. There is police firing and dawn-to-dusk curfew in several towns. The grievances of the Madhesis are genuine. These Maithili, Bhojpuri and Awadhi-speaking Nepalese, who look, dress and talk like their neighbours in India, are often derisively referred to as Indians. They have been systematically excluded from the political process and till recently denied Nepalese citizenship. 

 Brahmins and Rajputs (Bahuns and Chhetris) from the hills dominate Nepals state and politics. Although the Madhesis officially comprise 35 per cent of the population, they are grossly under-represented in the political parties. Except the avowedly Madhesi Sadbhavana Party, with its two factions led by Anandi Devi and Badri Mandal, none of the parties have any Madhesis as their national office bearers. The presence of Madhesis in their central committee or national executive is nowhere near adequate. Moreover, the national parties have tended to field non-Madhesi candidates from the Terai constituencies for parliament. Their district presidents in the Terai are mostly Paharis. The representation of the Terai in parliament is also lopsided because of the size of a constituency has no relation to the number of voters. In the hilly areas, there are constituencies with only 5,000 voters, while in the Terai, a single constituency can have over 5 lakh voters. 

 The Madhesis are also under-represented in the army, the police and in civilian administration. In the army, there are hardly any Madhesi commissioned officers. There are well-educated Madhesi doctors and engineers in Nepal but there is not a single Madhesi chief district officer in any of the 75 districts of the country. However, the Madhesis complain of discrimination not only based on past experiences. They also fear that in the course of building a new Nepal, they may be left out once again, as the Paharis may not want to share power with them. This fear may be unfounded in the new political environment but the Madhesis do not want the constituent assembly election to be held till the issue of their representation is sorted out.

 It is nor surprising, therefore, that there is a lot of support among the people of the Terai for the struggle for Madhesi rights as well as other issues such as a unified Terai, land reforms, citizenship, increase in development aid and accountability for past discrimination. It is unlikely that these agitations will die down through police repression, as the issues that are being raised are not law and order problems. To be fair, it was the Maoists who first organized the Madhesis under the Madhesi Rashtriya Mukti Morcha. Now, three other groups have come up. The Jantantrik Terai Mukti Morcha, led by Jai Krishna Goit, first broke away from the Maoists. Then, another faction, also called JTMM, and led by Jwala Singh, broke away from Goits group. Both were with the Maoists earlier and advocated the use of arms to liberate the Terai. Former schoolteacher, Upendra Yadav, a former activist of CPN (UML), leads the third group called the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum. 

 The two JTMM groups have also used the cover of Madhesi rights to indulge in criminal activities, including kidnapping, robberies and smuggling across the Indo-Nepal border. Now monarchist parties, such as the Lok Janshakti Party led by the former prime minister, Surya Bahadur Thapa, the two factions of the Rashtriya Prajatantrik Party, one led by Pashupati Shamshere Jang Bahadur Rana and the other by Kamal Thapa and Rabindranath Sharma, and the Sadbhavna Party, are believed to be stoking the fire in the Terai. While Goit and Jwala Singhs groups may be amenable to talks with Kathmandu on Madhesi rights, Upendra Yadavs group, allegedly fronting for the monarchists, has refused to talk.

 Nepalese political observers also point to the role being played by Hindu extremist organizations from India in fomenting trouble in the Terai to save the king. A high-ranking Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh representative from Nagpur is believed to have held a meeting in Gorakhpur with several royalists, including Upendra Yadav and members of the Sadbhavna Party. The role played by the local Indian MP, Mahant Avaidhyanath, is also being questioned by some in this regard. Whether there is any truth to these conspiracies or not is difficult to say. But it stands to reason that the king will encourage these groups because it suits him to destabilize the situation in the hope of carving out some space for himself. What seems clear to the Madhesis, however, is that if there is going to be power-sharing in the new Nepal, then they have to be accommodated in the constituent assembly. Their chance of making their presence felt in Nepals politics and gain fair representation in the administration and the political process is staring them in the face. 

 It makes no sense for the Madhesi leadership to now push the royalist agenda. If they fight the kings battles, and let this opportunity slip, it will be an uphill task to undo the damage. Even if they take up arms, no one is going to write another interim constitution for them or organize another interim parliament. They should ditch the royalists, engage in a dialogue with the government and help devise new models of governance that would make Nepal a strong federal and pluralist democracy. 

 The debate on the kind of federalism that Nepal needs is just beginning. Should the Terai be one province or three, based on language and ethnic differences? Should Nepalese federalism unite the Paharis and the Madhesis or divide them? The federal model Nepal chooses should unite the masses. Those who seek to divide Nepal should look at the mess we have made in India and take heed.

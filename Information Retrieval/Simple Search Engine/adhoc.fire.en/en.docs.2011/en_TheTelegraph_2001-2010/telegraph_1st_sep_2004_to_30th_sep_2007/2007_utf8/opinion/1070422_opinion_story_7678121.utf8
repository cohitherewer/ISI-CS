The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BOYS ARMY

 The king is dead. Long live the king. This traditional rallying cry of monarchists has found an echo in the world of Indian cricket. This is not to suggest that the Board of Control for Cricket in India is trying to return to the age when Indian royals determined the fate of Indian cricket and cricketers. The slogan that the BCCI seems to have raised is: Greg Chappell has gone. Long live his policies and prescriptions. Chappells real legacy to Indian cricket was the emphasis he placed on youth and on fitness. This did not win him too many friends among the older Indian players and some sections of cricket administrators. This hostility and Indias ignominious exit from the World Cup ensured Chappells resignation from the position of coach. He knew that if he did not resign, he would be sacked. But all this could not stop Chappells message from becoming the most important influence in the selection of the team for the tour of Bangladesh. The selection committee had an unambiguous brief from the working committee to pick a young team. The immediate and predictable outcome of such a directive was the dropping of the two aging stars Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly for the one-day internationals to be played against Bangladesh. The other victims of the pro-youth orientation were Harbhajan Singh and Ajit Agarkar. Irfan Pathan goes not because of his age but because he has failed to perform.

 It is clear that the BCCI has decided to use the Bangladesh tour as an opportunity to seed new and younger players. One problem that has always stalked the selection process in India is the lack of depth in the talent pool. This is the principal reason for the over-dependence on stars, irrespective of their performance and their age. India has not nurtured, as a matter of policy, a second string of players who can easily step into the shoes of older players who are forced to step down because of fatigue or injury. Chappell, during his tenure as coach, was instituting a process that would allow younger and talented players to appear at the international level. The BCCI has now taken over the baton. The Bangladesh tour is a perfect opportunity to experiment with a younger team. The hope is that some members of this squad will become top players in the very near future. There can be no doubt that the selection committee, under pressure or not, has taken a positive step for the future of Indian cricket.

 No comment on the selection will be complete without a word on the selection committee itself. There are three members of the committee, out of a total of five, who have never played cricket at the highest level. In fact, it will not be an exaggeration to suggest that only the chairman, Dilip Vengsarkar, has the credentials to be a selector of a national side. It is high time the BCCI got top players to act as selectors. Mediocrity can only select mediocrities.

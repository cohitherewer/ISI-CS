The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Happily never after

 Shakespeare had called the door to the conjugal bedroom the door of truth. (This was, unfortunately, in Othello.) That door, symbolically speaking, remains shut in most modern societies. This signals the essentially private nature of modern marriage. But the closed door also makes it difficult for those outside to know, understand, legislate, prove or judge what has been going on inside. So, by clarifying what constitutes mental cruelty in the eyes of the law when seeking divorce, the Supreme Court is attempting to chart two virtually unfathomable terrains marriages and minds. Both are notoriously difficult to represent in court, making any attempt to bring them within the purview of legal clarity fraught with risks and ambiguities. Henceforth, deciding unilaterally not to have a child will be counted as cruelty within a marriage. This includes sterilizing oneself or having an abortion without the knowledge and consent of ones spouse (or without a medical reason, in the case of abortions). Refusing to have sex with ones spouse, for a sustained period of time, without valid physical or other reasons, has also been deemed cruel by the court.

 The law, in order to be fair, has to be able to accommodate a whole range of probable actualities within a specific social context. And when it comes to reproductive rights that is, control over the entire process of making, having and bringing up babies Indian men and women are still far too unequal (and often brutally so) for these clarifications not to provoke doubts about their effectiveness in ensuring gender justice. For a woman, to be tied to her husbands consent when it comes to planning an abortion could mean a serious form of physical vulnerability in circumstances, which, though extreme, are quite easily imaginable in India. Similarly, it is only fair that ones spouse should know that one does not want to have children. But what if the spouse does not agree, and it becomes impossible to conduct the matter bilaterally? Would it then be an imperative to go against ones wishes and have a child? Here, again, Indian society readily affords an alarming number of instances in which such an imperative might severely compromise a womans well-being. Difficult reproductive choices are by no means confined to urban professional couples from the middle and upper classes fighting over their careers. To be able to refuse to have a child may often be a far more fundamental question of survival, of life and death, for a woman.

 An emphasis on the sexual and reproductive obligations within marriage runs the risk of reducing marriage and sex to their most conservative function: the propagation of the species. Modernity demands a more open, nuanced and flexible understanding of human companionship, and of the actual inequalities and asymmetries between the sexes when it comes to being able to choose what to do with ones body.

 Letters to Editor

 Is fair foul?

 Sir Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was hell-bent on holding the Book Fair on the Maidan and it seems that the chief ministers wish is about to be granted (Pushed by CM, defence bypasses army and clears fair, Jan 17). The way he pressurized the Centre to bypass the armys objections and ensure that the fair venue remains unchanged came as a shock. Bhattacharjees love of books cannot quite justify this kind of behaviour on his part. The continuation of a cultural event cannot be reason enough to trample on the greenery. There is no reason why the Book Fair cannot be shifted somewhere else. If Bengalis love books, they can surely travel a little further to buy and browse through the coveted volumes. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan 

 Sir Book lovers in Calcutta can now breathe easy. The book fair will continue to be held on the Maidan. Earlier, the high court had shot down the public interest petition filed by the Publishers and Booksellers Guild by stating that the guild is a profit-making body. Perhaps the honourable court needs to be reminded that public interest will only be served only if the Maidan is chosen as the permanent site for the book fair. For one, the Maidan is more accessible than the proposed alternative site. Book-lovers can travel at far less cost to visit the fair, and the time taken would be shorter for most if it is held at the Maidan rather than on the bypass. 

 Environmental activists are of the opinion that the book fair cannot remain at its usual place because it is polluting the environment. But these very men prefer to look the other way when political parties hold rallies in the nearby Brigade Parade grounds, littering and damaging the place in the process. One would also like to ask how much has been done to protect and enhance Calcuttas green cover in the last few years. Merely stopping the book fair will not help solve the Maidans many problems. This stretch of green needs to be cared for throughout the year. In fact, a few simple steps can help reduce pollution levels at the fair premises. Why not start with prohibiting food and beverage companies from setting up stalls on the fair grounds. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has described the Calcutta Book Fair as a big cultural event. But he seems to have forgotten the fact that the fair causes irreparable harm to the Maidan. The Calcutta high court had done the right thing by asking the army to decide whether the fair could be held at the Maidan or not. Even the army was ken to shift the fair elsewhere. But Bhattacharjee used his power to influence the Centre in getting round the armys efforts to save the Maidan. The army is the sole custodian of the Maidan. Should it not then have the freedom to perform its duty without intervention from political leaders? I have been going to the book fair for a number of years. In recent times, I found that most visitors thronged the food kiosks, which sometimes are more crowded than the book stalls. It seems that the people look upon the fair as a picnic, and not as an event where one could go and buy books at subsidized rates. The privileged status that the fair once enjoyed, being especially close to the heart of book-loving Calcuttans, is a thing of the past. The Maidan surely does not deserve to be destroyed for the sake of a fair that has lost its relevance for most Calcuttans. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir Calcuttans look forward to the commencement of the book fair every year. They would have been very disappointed if the fair were to be cancelled this year. Had Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee taken steps to find an alternative venue for the fair as he had promised, book lovers in the city would have been spared the agony of uncertainty before the fate of the fair was finally decided. Bhattacharjee has been trying to project himself as the face of a modern, progressive Bengal. But his failure to act on time over this issue only reconfirms the stereotype of the lackadaisical Bengali.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Kumar, Calcutta

 Sir The chief minister has prioritized the commercial interests of the Publishers and Booksellers guild over environmental concerns. Bhattacharjees government has never quite been a crusader for environmental issues. The ugliness of Calcutta is a living proof of this callousness. Issues like conservation or pollution-control continue to remain at the level of mere discussion and promises. And if any action is taken, it is with the vote banks in mind. By spoiling the Maidan with the fair, the ruling party hopes to enlist the support of thousands of revellers, mostly from the suburbs, who come to enjoy the annual carnival. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 TROUBLE IN RED PARADISE

 Keralas communists could take a lesson from their comrades in Bengal on how to keep the flock together, writes Sumanta Sen

 V.S. Achuthanandan: the fight within

 The recent meeting of the central committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Calcutta witnessed a sight that was somewhat unprecedented. Veteran communist and the chief minister of Kerala, V.S. Achuthanandan, called on his more senior comrade, Jyoti Basu, not to inquire about his health, but to complain against his state party secretary, Pinarai Vijayan. What was even more strange was that the meeting was not kept a secret; the party knew it would be pointless to do that. The tug of war between the two men is common knowledge and has spilled out on the streets in their home state.

 Vijayan was also in the city in connection with the same meeting, but did not call on Basu. The efforts of the general secretary, Prakash Karat, and other senior leaders to mend the fences did not bear fruit either. All that they agreed upon was that henceforth, there would be no exchange of words in public. How long this agreement will last is anybodys guess. The quarrel is no longer ideological, it has now attained a personal dimension. This happened when Vijayan failed to stop Achuthanandan from becoming the chief minister, and then decided to create problems for the latter at every possible step. The latest example of this was a minister close to Vijayan negotiating on an Asian Development Bank loan by keeping the chief minister and the cabinet in the dark.

 This was something that has not been witnessed even in Congress ministries. A.K. Anthony had a running battle with another old hand, K. Karunakaran, but, even then, the state had not seen such open resistance to the chief ministers authority. The Marxist minister concerned tried to explain that he was merely continuing the efforts that had been initiated by the preceding Congress ministry, an explanation that put a further question mark on his conduct. Neither the politburo nor the central committee bought the argument, and Vijayan was rapped on the knuckles. But the party did not order any action against him, which would have been wholly justified in a disciplined organization. The party did not do so because it might have feared that such a step would cause a split in the ranks. So now, whatever may be the scene at Thiruvananthapuram, at A.K.G. Bhavan in New Delhi, Prakash Karat will have to continue to pretend that all is well in the southern state.

 The Achuthanandan-Vijayan face-off is of course not the first instance of communists being at loggerheads with their own comrades. In Tripura, Nripen Chakraborty, had been so enraged at the politburo choosing Dasarath Dev as the chief minister after the 1993 election (in which the Congress was routed thanks to both Chakraborty and Dev) that he kept on throwing a spanner in the latters works as chairman of the state planning board. Things came to such a pass that the party was forced to expel Chakraborty, a committed communist of many years and a veteran of many battles.

 Back to Kerala. Political observers cannot have forgotten how K.R. Gowri Amma had striven hard to stop E.K. Nayanar from becoming the chief minister after an earlier election. Neither Nripen Chakraborty nor GowriAmma had a personal axe to grind. They had only felt that the party would not be safe in the hands of their opponents. The present tussle is also being portrayed as one between liberals and traditionalists. One is not sure whether that is really the truth. The manner in which the minister loyal to Vijayan behaved seems to indicate that the rot has gone deep. What should be of greater concern is the possibility that self-aggrandizement on the part of party members may have helped in aggravating the crisis. Incidentally, the CPI(M) is not the only party to have suffered on this count in Kerala. The Revolutionary Socialist Party suffered a split as well, and not entirely on ideological grounds.

 As far as the Marxists are concerned, the infighting in Kerala is a cause for major worry. On the one hand, the nature of politics there does not allow either the CPI(M)-led front or the Congress to remain in office for more than five years. The present situation would only make it more difficult for the Left Democratic Front to break the jinx five years later. More than that, there are apprehensions about the future of the party organization, which is no longer a monolithic structure. If the party weakens, so will the mass organization among workers, students, women and so on. This had not happened in Tripura. Even after Nripen Chakrabortys expulsion from the party, the comrades in Tripura, particularly the present chief minister, Manik Sarkar, had not turned their faces away from their former leader. In Kerala, there is no love lost between the chief minister and the state party secretary.

 Here, one cannot help take note of an aspect of life in Kerala that has often been a source of trouble. Gulf money may have benefited the common people in a myriad ways. But it has also ushered in a less savoury lifestyle among ordinary Malayalis. Communists may stoutly deny this but is it not possible that sections of the party have also been affected by this malice? After all, communists are also human and they may have the occasional urge to break away from the shackles of tradition for personal gain. Moreover, the understanding that Marxism is not a dogma and needs realistic application is also a line of thought that is gaining popularity. This seems to be the favoured position in West Bengal. But, mercifully, the signs of aberration here have so far been kept in check.

 There are other points to ponder; Kerala had seen the communist movement throwing up such giants as E.M.S. Namboodiripad and A.K. Gopalan. However, they failed to groom successors like Promode Dasgupta did in this state. The culture in Alimuddin Street has not changed, even though the old state headquarters with its wooden staircase has made way for a swanky structure. There have been numerous speculations over the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee-Biman Bose relationship but they have always died down early. Jyoti Basu, at times, aired his differences but he made sure that the party was not affected in any way. He was not always comfortable with Promode Dasgupta but the two always worked together to take the party forward.

 Things in Kerala could have been sorted out if Prakash Karat had been able to play some kind of a dominant role in his capacity as the general secretary. But then, he is a Malayali by virtue of his birth rather than anything else. Karats upbringing in Britain and his days spent in the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, make him a bit of an outsider at Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kochi, Allepey and elsewhere in the rice and coconut land. Yet, it will need a true son of the soil to tackle the infighting which seems to be an entirely home-made product that is difficult for others to comprehend.

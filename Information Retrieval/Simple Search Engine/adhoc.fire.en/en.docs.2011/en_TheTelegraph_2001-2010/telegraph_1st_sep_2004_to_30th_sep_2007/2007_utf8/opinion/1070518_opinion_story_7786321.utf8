 Men are not always men

A Little Book On Men (Yoda, Rs 150) by Rahul Roy is a book attractively designed, interestingly written and delightful to read. This slim volume comes fully illustrated in black, white and gray by Anupama Chatterjee and Sherna Dastur. It claims to be an excellent introduction to the big questions about men and masculinities. Now that the fight for womens rights is becoming pass, it is time to explore the other masculinities, those that have been ignored, silenced, and de-legitimized by the hegemonic masculinity typified by the Marlboro man. The book ends with a prose translation of Rabindranath Tagores Birpurush (The Hero). The delicate irony of the poem, couched in a childs voice, comes from the fact that the child who dreams of being brave and valorous is acutely conscious of being the delicate one in the family. A Little Book on Men is an exploration of thousands of others in a similar predicament. 

Wolf Of The Plains (HarperCollins, Rs 395) by Conn Iggulden is the epic story of the great conqueror Genghis Khan. The readers get to know how the eleven-year-old Temujin, left to starve with his family on the bleak Mongolian plain, ultimately became the khan of the sea of grass, Genghis. For those with a taste for bestsellers of this kind, theres more to come. Wolf of the Plains marks just the beginning of the Conqueror series on Gehghis Khan and his descendants.

 RUSKIN BONDs BOOK OF VERSE (Penguin, Rs 160) is a collection to cherish. It brings together several of Bonds verses, which he had composed at various stages of his life. There are poems on Love, Nature, Childhood and Travel. The unpretentious, lyrical style that marks Bonds prose is found in his poetry as well. Some of the poems seem a little trite but admirers of Bond can easily pass them over as exceptions.

 THE INDISPENSABLE VISIONARY (Pearson, Rs 225) by Emma S. Etuk promises to turn your dreams into realities. All leaders from Moses to Mandela are supposed to be united in having frequent visitations from God and then irradiating such godly attributes as courage, humility and wisdom. This book is an invaluable guide to those who desire to be similarly blessed.

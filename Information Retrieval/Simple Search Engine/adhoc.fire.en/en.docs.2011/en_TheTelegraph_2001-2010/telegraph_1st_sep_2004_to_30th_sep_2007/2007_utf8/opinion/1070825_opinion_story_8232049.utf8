The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TO MOURN, HEAL AND UNITE

 Ananda Lal

 Theatre

 Two brand new American productions flew in recently, depicting two disparate communities experiences in that land. The US consulates presentation, My Soul Is a Witness (picture), was prepared specially for this tour by Pegasus Players, Chicago. David Barr III wrote it originally for the JENA Company, New York, in 2005 and Pegasus, with whom he also works, turned it into this portable edition travelling light: few personnel, minimal props and costumes, no sets. The docudrama is a rapid reader on the civil rights movement, 1955-68. Its title bears several associations for Americans, from the Black spiritual, My soul is a witness to the Lord, to the popular book by the same name that gives a chronology of the movement during 1954-65. Of course, in 90 minutes, only few people and events can be recalled, but they rivet the audience from start to finish. The show relates a capsule history of mans inhumanity to man, inspiring and moving to tears with stories of those who kept the faith and resisted.

 Alex Levy, the director, underlined the links between Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., twice incorporating Gandhis maxim, Be the change that you wish to see. The cast of five glided in and out of characters such as King and Malcolm X to those lesser known in India like Emmett Till, the Chicago boy murdered for acting fresh with a white woman, and Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her bus seat to a white passenger. Right through, they all sang a cappella effortlessly. They roused with the protest favourite Aint Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around and moved with the macabre Strange Fruit (on lynching) and the gospel traditionals, proving how Black songs mourned, healed and united. To serve the objective of educational theatre, the organizers should have arranged performances for schools and colleges.

 The Bengali-American group Ethnomedia from New Jersey, which stunned Calcutta last year with Ron, returned for the world premiere of dramatist-director Sudipta Bhawmiks Satyameva. A senior executive body-shopping software engineers fires his incompetent new recruit, who pleads that he should not be sent back to India. By a remarkable plot of twists and turns (perhaps too many of them) Bhawmik conveys older Bengalis nostalgia for their birthplace and younger Bengalis desire to emigrate to America. Sankar Ghoshal and Indranil Mukherjee respectively give realistic portrayals of these parts, but the playwrights craftsmanship tends to get the better of heartfelt emotions, which we had found in Ron.

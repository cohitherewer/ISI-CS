 PITFALLS ON THE ROAD TO A GLOBAL CONQUEST

 SIDE-SHOW

 Gwynne Dyer argues that the USs job in Iran, if Bush takes it on, could prove more difficult than that in Iraq 

 As I pointed out recently, any minor clash along Iraqs land or sea frontier with Iran could kill American troops and give George W. Bush an excuse to attack Iran. In fact, if Irans Revolutionary Guards had got it wrong and attacked an American boarding party, Bush would have had his excuse by now. But if President Bush gives the order for an attack on Iran, then General Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will face a big decision.

 Some senior soldiers in the United States of America were worried about the strategic wisdom and even the legality of invading Iraq, but nobody resigned over it. It was obvious that the US would win the actual war quickly and cheaply, and almost nobody worried about the aftermath. But an attack on Iran is different, even though it would not involve American ground troops (since all available US combat troops are committed to Iraq), because any competent general knows that this is a war the US cannot win.

 Air strikes alone cannot win a war, however massive they are, and they probably could not even destroy all of Irans nuclear facilities, which are numerous, dispersed, and often deeply buried. Many Iranians would be killed, but what would the US do next? It would have very few options, whereas Iran would have many.

 Iran could flood Iraq with sophisticated weapons and send volunteers to help the fight against US forces there. It could throw international markets into turmoil by halting its own oil exports. It could try to close the entire Gulf to tanker traffic (with a fair chance of success), and throw the entire world economy into a crisis. And any further US air strikes would simply harden Iranians resolve.

 So would General Pace attack Iran if Bush ordered him to? His only alternative would be to resign, and he does have that option. Senior officers like Pace, while still bound by the code of military discipline, acquire a political responsibility as well. Like cabinet ministers, they cannot oppose a government decision while in office, but they have the right and even the duty to resign rather than carry out a decision that they believe would be disastrous.

 The resignation of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and possibly several of the other chiefs as well would be an immensely powerful gesture. It could stop an attack on Iran dead in its tracks, for the White House would have to find other officers who would carry out its orders. It would doubtless find them, but such a shocking event might finally enable the US Congress to find its backbone and refuse support for another illegal and foredoomed war.

 This is not a hypothetical discussion: my guess is that both the joint chiefs and the White House understand that the option of resignation is on the table. Consider the dance that was done around the question of Iran and Explosively Formed Penetrators in February. (EFPs are charge weapons that can penetrate armour at a considerable distance. Most major armies have had them for several decades.)

 On February 11, US officials in Baghdad claimed that the EFPs that have killed some 170 American troops in Iraq since 2004 were Iranian-made, and supplied to Iraqi insurgents by the highest levels of the Iranian government. The White House spokesman, Tony Snow, picked up the theme, insisting that they were being supplied by the Quds unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. The Quds Force is, in fact, an official arm of the Iranian government and, as such, the government bears responsibility and accountability for its actions, he said.

 Familiar stuff from the run-up to the Iraq war but then something unscripted happened. General Peter Pace, visiting in Australia, said that the involvement of the Iranian government was not proven: We know that the explosively formed projectiles are manufactured in Iran, but I would not say by what I know that the Iranian government clearly knows or is complicit. A day later, in Jakarta, he repeated his doubts: What [the evidence] does say is that things made in Iran are being used in Iraq to kill coalition soldiers.

 There is a civil-military confrontation brewing in the US more serious than anything that has been seen since President Harry Truman fired General Douglas MacArthur during the Korean war. But this time, if the general acts on his convictions, he will be in the right.

 Letters to Editor

 Out of fashion

 Sir The decision of the Union minister of information and broadcasting, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, to ban FTV for two months is illogical (FTV gets the boot for body show, March 30). Shows such as Midnight Hot, with skimpily dressed and semi-naked models are being cited as a reason for the blackout. But Midnight Hot is not the only programme on FTV, which also covers Indian fashion shows. If FTV is outrageous by Indian standards, then all fashion shows across the country should be banned and fashion institutes shut down. Besides, newspapers freely publish pictures of scantily-clad women to increase their sales. If the I amp;B ministry wants to be consistent in its moral stance, then it must come down heavily on the print media as well. The government might be headed the taliban way if it goes further with its irrational moral campaign.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir The introduction of the conditional access system has ensured that only those willing to pay for FTV get to access it. The viewers opting for FTV must be assumed to be mature enough for the adult content of the channel. It is their duty to ensure, if they so want, that minors in the household do not watch shows like Midnight Hot. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi should stop playing the moral guardian and allow Indians to watch what they want to.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir If the I amp;B ministry is so keen on moral policing, it should ban the live shows of Rakhi Sawant, some of the advertisements on television, as well a majority of the recent Hindi films. With the internet being accessed from almost every home today, such bans have become meaningless. Adjacent to the report FTV gets the boot for body show, The Telegraph had carried a picture of Sushmita Sen in a revealing outfit during Neeta Lullas show at the Lakm India Fashion Week. Quite obviously, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has no control over what is printed in the newspapers. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir If the I amp;B ministrys reason for banning FTV is the Midnight Hot show, then why is the ban only for two months? Will the show go off the air after May? And even if this show is discontinued after May, then there will certainly be other similar programmes to take its place. Does Priya Ranjan Das Munshi suppose that people will stop watching these shows after being forced to abstain for two months? But perhaps Das Munshis intent is noble after all he just wants to make sure that the hot summer months are not made hotter by FTV programmes.

 Yours faithfully, 

S. Datta, Calcutta 

 Sir The debate over what is obscene and what is not is a highly subjective one. Obscenity cannot be judged by a fixed yardstick. The decision is best left to individual taste and discretion. Also, censorship is not a practice that finds favour in a democracy. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Budget deficits

 Sir Ashok Mitras analysis of this years Union budget, in Eine kleine inflation(March 19), is questionable. First, his criticism that the defence spending has gone up during the last four years is made ignoring the fact that expenses under all budgetary heads be it on education, health or agriculture have gone up during this period. Incidentally, China has also considerably increased defence expenditure in its current budget. Mitras other contention, that the government is only concerned with the industry and services sector at the expense of agriculture, is also ill-judged. It demands pointing out that even the Marxist government of West Bengal now admits that spending on agriculture alone cannot alleviate poverty. That industrialization would improve the economy of the state cannot possibly be denied, though the use of force to achieve this end can be questioned. Finally, Mitras assertion that nothing is being done to contain inflation is dubious. Has not forward trading in some goods, and export of sugar, been banned? Have not import duties been reduced? Mitra alleges that the Centre is trying to liquidate the farmers so that agricultural products can be bought from the United States of America. This itself is a queer logic. Even if we assume, for the sake of argument, that India will be importing huge quantities of farm produce, how could Mitra claim that all of it will be from the US?

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir Ashok Mitra seems to have ignored the role gross domestic product plays in the economy of a country. His claim that the capitalist raises the price of his finished product and laps up the extra profit till prices of input, including wages, catch up, is full of wrong assumptions. In a free market economy, it is not the special prerogative of the capitalist to boost the GDP by increasing the prices of commodities. This kind of assumption is simplistic and sounds propagandist (as do some of his insinuations like lovely, lovely rate of growth of GDP...holy obligation of the capitalist...the current shapers of the nations destiny have entered into a commitment with the powers-that-be in Washington DC and so on). Empirical evidence shows that since the beginning of the reforms, GDP growth has been accompanied by phenomenal improvement in the quality of life of the poorest citizens. The cars and two-wheelers that cause congestion on the city roads do not only belong to the rich. If Tata Motors cheap cars are eventually released in the market, we shall see many of them plying on village roads as well.

 Yours faithfully,

H.P. Gangopadhyay, Calcutta

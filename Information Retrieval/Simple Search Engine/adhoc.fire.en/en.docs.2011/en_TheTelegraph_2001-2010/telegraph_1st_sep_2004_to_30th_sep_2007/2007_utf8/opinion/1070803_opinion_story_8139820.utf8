 WRITING AND MAKING HISTORY

 A very British Family By Laura Trevelyan,

 I.B. Tauris, 18.99

 Laura Trevelyan writes about her own ancestors who were an integral part of Englands intellectual aristocracy. Just two names would have given the family ample license to belong to the intellectual elite: Thomas Babington Macaulay and George Macaulay Trevelyan. But there were others, less well-known but very talented. The Trevelyans wrote history and made it.

 The family was privileged, wealthy, well-connected and driven by a sense of civic duty. The clan produced mandarins, politicians and historians. In the great days of England, the Trevelyans not only acted as chroniclers of that greatness but were also very close to the decision-making processes. The historian A.L. Rowse once wrote, Integrity to the point of eccentricity, honesty to the point of rudeness, tactless and rough handed but of an indubitably aristocratic distinction, devoted public spirit with an equal ability to carry it into action; a marked idiosyncrasy held in check by strong common sense; not much sense of humour. That distinguished family were apt to think there were Trevelyans and then the rest of the human race. The family was so closely knit, and the three brothers, Charles, Robert and George, resembled each other so much that someone remarked, Are they a sect, these Trevelyans, like the Wesleyans?

 It is perhaps important to explain the Trevelyan-Macaulay connection since it has a Calcutta angle, and gave the middle name to the greatest of the family, George Macaulay Trevelyan. Charles Trevelyan, who inherited the family seat of Wallington in Northumberland, went to Charterhouse and Haileybury. He came out to India in 1826 to make a career. He was only 19 then. He first worked in Delhi and then came to Calcutta where he befriended Macaulay, whose sister he wooed and married. In the 1830s, the three of them lived in a house on Chowringhee which later became the home of the Bengal Club.

 This book attempts to tell the story of the family through the lives of five men: Charles, his son George Otto, the latters eldest and youngest sons, Charles Philips and George Macaulay, and lastly, the latters son, Humphry, who was Lauras grandfather. 

 George Otto became a famous historian, but he was also cabinet minister under Gladstone. His eldest son, Charles Philips, became a Labour politician and a campaigner of the radical Left; his youngest son was one of Englands greatest historian. Humphry was a German scholar and a fellow of Kings Cambridge. In World War II he was called upon to work in Bletchley Park. This is the story of a remarkable family told with an equally remarkable absence of pride.

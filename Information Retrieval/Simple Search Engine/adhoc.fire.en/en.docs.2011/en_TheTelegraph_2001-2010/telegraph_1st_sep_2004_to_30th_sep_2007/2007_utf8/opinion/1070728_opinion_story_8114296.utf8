 TRANSFORMED BY A QUIRK OF THE BROW

 Soumitra Das 

 Visual Arts

 It is strange how some artists are remembered for a single quality of their work to the exclusion of all else. Gobardhan Ash is one such. While he is remembered along with Somnath Hore, Jainul Abedin, Chittaprasad and Paritosh Sen as one of the artists who had faithfully documented the man-made Great Bengal Famine of the Forties, no mention is ever made of Ashs ability to break the rules of academism and received wisdom and striking out on his own. As a matter of fact, no mention is ever made of Ashs talent for creating images which often smacked of subversion. 

 Gobardhan Ash had chosen to live in self-imposed exile in Begumpur in Hooghly district, best known for its saris. He was born in 1907, and when his 80th birthday was celebrated and several artists had chosen to call on Ash in his village, it came as a surprise to the layperson that he was still around. Most had consigned Ash to the pages of art history. So it goes to the credit of Aakriti Art Gallery that it organized quite a large exhibition on the occasion of Gobardhan Ashs birth centenary. 

 The exhibition covers the whole gamut of his styles, which varied from academic realism taught in art schools in those times to a curious amalgam of folk and whimsy which were trailblazers. Some of his self-portraits and pencil sketches and drawings are quite remarkable as examples of Ashs mastery of drawing and the art of portraiture. He skilfully evoked the bounty of nature blue hills and coral trees in full bloom like many artists of his days. 

 Yet he was tired of the rigidity of the curriculum at the Government School of Art, Calcutta, and left it after five years in 1932 to join the Government Art School in Madras under Deviprasad Roy Choudhury. Having run away from home several times, he remained the quintessential wanderer. 

 The Progressive Writers Association displayed his grim and gray paintings of famine-stricken people in 1945. The details did not seem to have mattered. He created shadowy, spectral human beings as well as scavengers and the carrion crow. 

 Ash painted extensively in various media, including gouache and oil in the Sixties, and one can detect, if one really wants to, the influence of various modernist art movements such as pointillism and expressionism. But beyond these diverse stylistic choices what Ash conjured up was a phantasmagoric world a world of innocence that could also be dark and menacing like the rapacious hybrids he drew for the entertainment of his grandchildren. 

 Ash created these forms with bold strokes of his brush, often stabbing the surface, leaving behind splotches and dots of paint with visual kinetism. He tried to integrate and weave in our folk traditions in compositions like Who is it?, Hobu Gobu, Dumfounded, and Udasi, all of which could have been painted in a state when he slipped in and out of a dream they have that air of drowsiness that could charge up a fertile imagination. Occasionally, these works show flashes of humour, particularly when he paints the omnivorous monsters. 

 Ash had also mastered the art of distorting the classic features of faces which could have been painted by Jamini Roy only Jamini Roy gone askew. Like the patuas, Ash successfully created the impression of having painted these human figures without premeditation, tracing the path forged by tradition. But a quirk of the eyebrow or the eye turned it into the face of an eavesdropper who is all ears, or to that of a mawkish person (it could be a spook) of unspecified gender. 

 Little wonder that although Ash never sought publicity, in 1950, Pradosh Dasgupta ensured that he exhibited his works as a member of the Calcutta Group along with those of the Bombay Progressive Artists Group, which included M.F. Husain, Raza, Souza, Ara, Gade and Bakre.

 TRIUMPH OVER TRAGEDY

 - Czechs either want to forget their socialist past or are 

 simply not interested in it

 MEMORY GAME

 It is not on the must-see list 

 of Pragues tourists and holiday-makers. Even after you 

 have located the grand Palais Savarin off Vlatva Square 

 in Pragues main shopping district, you take some time to 

 find the Museum of Communism (picture). 

 What you see first are the large 

 signboards of McDonalds and a casino. But that is where 

 the museum is above McDonalds and next to the casino 

 on the first floor. As I climb up the staircase, I remember 

 the small museum of the Chinese communist party in Shanghai 

 in an obscure corner of a shiny commercial complex. That 

 museum, commemorating the time when Mao Zedong and his twenty-odd 

 comrades founded the party in 1921, is also easy to miss. 

 Most Czechs do not want to remember 

 most of the things associated with socialist rule or are 

 simply not interested. But they ought to know, especially 

 the young people who have not experienced it, Jana Kappelerova 

 tells me. She is the co-founder of the museum along with 

 two American businessmen settled in Prague. 

 Memory was an important element 

 in the museums design. When Jan Kaplan, a Czech documentary 

 film-maker who fled the country after the Prague Spring 

 of 1968, was hired to design the museum, he visualized the 

 countrys communist history as a three-act tragedy the 

 dream, the reality and the nightmare. The first exhibits 

 you see as you step into the first room are the statues 

 of Lenin, Stalin and Marx. But the bronze bust of Vaclav 

 Havel and the pictures of the Velvet Revolution of 1989 

 in the last room suggest a fourth act beyond Kaplans tragedy. 

 Hours later, I sit in a caf on 

 Wenceslas Square, the scene of most Czech tragedies and 

 triumphs, with Nenad Pejic, associate director of broadcasting 

 at the Prague station of the American-run Radio Free Europe. 

 The building that houses the offices of the RFE and Radio 

 Liberty, opposite the National Museum, captures the story 

 of the dramatic change from communism. It housed the Czechoslovak 

 stock exchange before World War II. After the communists 

 gained power in Prague, they had the national parliament 

 shifted there. After the fall of communism, the building 

 was given to the RFE on a monthly rent of one Czech kroner! 

 It was Havels gesture to the RFE for all that it did for 

 Czechoslovakias freedom from communism, Pejic says. 

 No, he would not say that post-communist 

 eastern Europe does not have its problems. As in Poland, 

 Hungary or Russia, the gap between the rich and the poor 

 is widening in the Czech Republic. The collapse of the old 

 social security system hurts retired people. Rising unemployment 

 and crime are a major worry for governments and the people. 

 The rush of global capital has thrown many native entrepreneurs 

 out of business, sometimes hurting national pride. Most 

 of the major print and non-print media here are now owned 

 by Austrians. Half the buildings that you see on both sides 

 of Wenceslas Square have always been owned by Havels family 

 (taken over by the communist state and returned to the owners 

 after 1989). The other half now belongs to multinational 

 companies, Pejic tells me between draughts of the famous 

 Pilsner beer. 

 But one benefit has flowed abundantly 

 in all these lands since the fall of the socialist regimes. 

 Closed countries and societies under communism, they seem 

 to have taken to travel and tourism in a big way in order 

 to boost the economy. A country of 20 million people, the 

 Czech Republic has an average of 100 million tourist nights 

 every year. Many more will come on Moravian and Bohemian 

 holidays, I am told, once they are weary of the beaten tracks.

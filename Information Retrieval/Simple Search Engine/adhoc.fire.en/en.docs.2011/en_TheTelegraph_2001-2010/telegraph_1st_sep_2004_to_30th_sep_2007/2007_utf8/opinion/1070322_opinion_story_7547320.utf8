 MIRTH AND MALICE

 CHINA DIARY - NEHA SAHAY

 The Lunar New Year hangover is still on. And it shows the way China is changing every day.

 For the countrys vast migrant labour population, the New Year is normally traumatic, what with the intense desire to go home for the festival, and the struggle to get their wage arrears so that they can afford the trip. 

 But this year, theres good news for this sector. In one village, almost every migrant worker drove home in his own car. A couple of years more, and they could even settle down with their families in Beijing, they hope.

 Sick to death with life in the sweatshops, many workers dont go back to the city after the New Year holiday, till they have to. This year, their failure to return has meant gloom for a section of Chinas new rich. Small factory owners in the Pearl Delta in the South, where the first SEZs began, are sure their workers have been lured elsewhere. A garment factory owner in Guangzhou had even promised them a 15 per cent increase before they left for their villages. This would have taken their salary up to 1,200 yuan. Now, this employer of 29 has to make do with just three new skilled workers; the remaining will have to be apprentices.

 Another factory owner in the same region had an inauspicious start to his New Year instead of the usual greetings, he got curses on his mobile. You will be very poor this year to beg your food. All of your family will be knocked down to death by vehicles and none of you could even have a complete body, read the SMSs sent throughout the week. The sender refused to pick up his phone when the desperate owner called back. 

 Domestic tragedies

 Hi-tech celebrations were the order of the day, with some youngsters preferring to celebrate the entire New Year online, decorating their blogs with lanterns and chatting online. This addiction cost one obese 26-year-old his life: his body couldnt cope with the strain of staying seated almost all week. Many parents lamented that with markets, Karaoke bars and cafeterias shut down, TV and the internet were the only options for their kids. However, where things remained open round the clock, as in most big cities, there were other tragedies: three school children seriously damaged their vocal chords after setting up their own all-night karaoke competition.

 All this has made people demand a return to traditional New Year activities, which they feel, should be organized by the government. Public pressure forced Beijing city authorities to repeal a ban on firecrackers which have been a favourite mode of celebrating. But again, they had cost a man his life, and two persons their eyes.

 However, in the interior, theres no ban. The China Daily published a picture of a worker pulling a cart full of gas cylinders through a blast of firecrackers in an Urumqi neighbourhood. 

 As during Diwali, during the Chinese New Year too, there is a lot of hype about family values and brotherhood. One columnist even said that these values are the reason this festival remains special. Previously, it was special because occasions to eat and dress well were rare; now, occasions to spend time with family and long lost childhood friends, and interact with neighbours have become rare.

 Maybe, but this year, a whole lot of Chinese had no qualms about selling the expressions of such affection. For the first time, New Year gifts were auctioned online; some had been won at office parties, others were bribes. Selling off the nth MP3 player and sixth steel chopstick set even at a discount, made sense. 

 However, those who went out of their way to be generous during the New Year were in for a nasty shock. The number of blood donors doubled in Beijing; but 50 per cent were rejected as their blood was found to be too contaminated with fat to be acceptable.

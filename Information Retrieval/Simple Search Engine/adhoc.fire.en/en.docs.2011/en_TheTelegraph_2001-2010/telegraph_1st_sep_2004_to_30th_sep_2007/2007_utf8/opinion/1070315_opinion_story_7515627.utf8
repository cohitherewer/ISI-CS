The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LITTLE LEARNING IS A DANGEROUS THING

 Educational Initiatives finds out that schoolchildren in India, even those studying in elite institutions, are learning very little

 Going nowhere

 Developing countries and countries with transition economies risk being further marginalized in a competitive global knowledge economy. This is because their education and training systems are not equipping learners with the skills they need. To respond to the problem, policymakers need to make fundamental changes. They need to do away with the information-based, teacher-directed rote learning, provided within a formal education system governed by directives. It should be replaced by a new type of learning that emphasizes creating, applying, analysing and synthesizing knowledge, and engaging in collaborative learning throughout the lifespan.

 Educational Initiatives, a research-based organization, and Wipro conducted a survey of about 32,000 students of Classes IV, VI and VIII of 140 English-medium schools in Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore. These institutions are perceived as the leading schools of the cities (and were identified through an independent survey).

 Educational Initiatives would like to see a significant improvement in the quality of learning through research-based means, with a special focus on assessment. It is important to accurately measure how well children are learning so that this can serve as feedback on how our education system is doing on the whole. Educational Initiatives is committed to improving the quality of school education. Much of this effort is focused on private, English-medium schools, although the government-aided institutions have also been attended to.

 An analysis of the results of the study suggests that even in the top schools, students are not learning well and with any real understanding. That is, their learning is superficial and based on the recall of bookish facts.

 Probably a more disturbing finding is that these children from Indias top schools, scored lower than children of 43 countries in an international achievement test. Details of the study and the findings are available at http://www.ei-india.com. All the relevant data, including the question papers and detailed analysis are in the public domain. 

 Here is just one example that will elucidate what the ground situation is even in the elite schools. The children are actually learning a lot less than what they are supposed to be learning. The Education Initiatives has been conducting the ASSET test for the past five years in over 600 leading schools in India, Nepal, Middle East and Singapore with over 1,00,000 students taking the test every year. The research indicates that the situation in India is significantly better than that in some other countries (though even within India, the situation varies significantly from one region to another).

 The question as to where our education system is headed would concern not only the whole of India but also each one of us individually. That there are serious gaps in learning both in government schools and in top private schools is a matter of grave concern.

 Here are a few suggestions for a complete change in the current educational system, for nothing else would do.

 One, boards (starting with the Central Board of Secondary Education) should award percentile scores in addition to marks. Over three years, the format and the official board results should start emphasizing on the percentiles, not the marks.

 Two, an application section should be added to board examinations. This section should have 10 per cent weightage in the first year, but it should increase by 10 per cent each year till it reaches 60 per cent.

 Three, two public education campaigns maybe not very different from the current Incredible India campaign promoting tourism and the countrys heritage should be launched. One of them should emphasize the role of the teacher and encourage the best minds to join the profession. The other, targeted at parents, should stress on the fact that true learning is something more than just marks and examinations.

 Four, the state textbook boards should be converted into textbook approval committees. Staffed by professionals, one central committee should provide syllabus guidelines for textbook-makers, and the state committees should approve and provide a rating to every textbook submitted. Printed textbooks must carry this rating and schools can choose from the different textbooks available.

 Five, following on the steps of the National Council of Education Research and Training, all states should put up the current textbooks online for free access. The new universal standard called Unicode should be used for regional languages.

 Six, various steps should be initiated to make know that excellence is valued. This is often though to be irrelevant or not communicated effectively to the student community. Ways in which this can be done are to have a nation-wide voluntary scholarship test around Class VI (gradually, such competitions can be organized around different non-academic skills as well). And holding competitions for teachers around best teaching aids, lesson plans and so on. The web should be used extensively to promote transparency and sharing aid.

 Seven, measures need to be adopted to actively promote teachers professional development. The most important of these is to have voluntary tests for teachers tests that allow a teacher to know where she stands. The government should encourage private initiative to develop these test patterns and ensure quality. Though the certification would not, and should not, have any statutory value, the quality they represent will soon earn value. For any new initiative, a ready pool of the motivated and capable teachers will be readily available.

 Eight, address the grievances of teachers. Teachers have a number of valid problems and one way of addressing them is to allow them to be brought out into the open. Technology allows us to do this today. A national website for teachers should allow them to register their grievances in their own language. 

 An independent group will see how trivial complaints can be dealt with and also maintain a summary (state-wise, later district-wise) of how many grievances have been published and how many have been resolved.

 Last, but not the least, it is necessary to encourage systematic research on a number of subjects which are of critical importance to education system as a whole. Some of these are the mother tongue versus English issue; identifying a measurable set of markers of excellence of a school and even compiling something like 50 Good Ideas that Work.

 The above are just a few ideas. The point is to initiate a larger debate and take this forward. To join the debate, one can write to infoei-india.com.

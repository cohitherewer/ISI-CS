 LUCKY TIMES

 Going by the wholesale price index, inflation has taken a dive in recent weeks. In the week ending September 1, it came down to 3.5 per cent. The last time it was this low was two years ago, in August 2005. That trough was followed by a bout of rising inflation, which peaked early this year. That was the time when prices of wheat and lentils suddenly shot up and the minister of agriculture was in hot water for a while; export of wheat was banned, and imports were accelerated. Little as he may have known it, the worst was over by then; inflation has been declining since. Inflation is usually determined by agricultural prices, but not this time. Inflation in food prices peaked early this year, but it did not come down thereafter. It slackened, but rose again to over 10 per cent in early July before coming down. 

 It is inflation in industrial prices that has come down sharply and steadily. It was close to 7 per cent in March; now it is approaching 4 per cent. The easing of industrial inflation may seem incongruous in the midst of a raging industrial boom. But clearly, the surge in investment after 2003 brought new capacity into production that has kept prices under check. The industrial boom has paid off in higher efficiency and sharper competition. The strangest case is that of inflation in fuel and power; it peaked in the middle of 2006 and has been coming down since. That is not unreasonable, since oil prices have settled down to a more sedate pace. What is most unusual is that the fuel and power index has been falling since the middle of this year. If the index is right, fuel and power prices this year are lower than they were last year. Such things do not usually happen in India, which has made a religion of chronic inflation. Since fuel and power are mostly produced by the governments, it is even more incredible that they should have reduced the prices they charge consumers. 

 A more detailed look at individual price indices shows that the indices for many oil products have remained constant for many months; some declined from time to time before freezing again. The oil companies bled a good deal in the years of rising crude prices because the government would not let them raise prices; they lost much money especially to consumers of kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas and diesel. As crude prices came down, the oil companies enjoyed the resulting replenishment of profits and passed some back to consumers. Consumers may not realize it, but they are living in balmy times as far as inflation is concerned. It has not been so low for many years, and it may be long before it comes down again. Let them celebrate their good fortune while it lasts.

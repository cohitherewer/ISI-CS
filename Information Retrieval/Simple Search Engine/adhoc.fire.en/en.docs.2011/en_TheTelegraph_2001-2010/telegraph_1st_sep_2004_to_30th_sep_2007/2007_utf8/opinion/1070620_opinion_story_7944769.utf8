The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 OLD HAT

 It would be an illusion to believe that despite a decade and half of economic reforms, the idea of government controls has been obliterated from peoples minds. Comrades seldom change their spots even if the entire world around them has changed. The Left parties have put forward a report which argues that large retail stores should be regulated and controlled by a licensing authority. Some of the proposals in the report are worth noting, if only to capture how embedded the idea of control is in the communist mindset. One proposal says that large retailers dealing in fresh fruits and vegetables and intending to sell these at prices lower than those of small vendors must establish large procurement centres and enter into long-term contracts with the producers. These centres should have reserved place for government agencies, and they will have to buy the produce of farmers even if they are of poor quality. The contracts with producers will enforce this. In other words, government interventions would be in place to prevent the working of the efficiencies of the market. The proposals, in fact, aim to increase the power of bureaucrats. One proposal says that if a large retail outlet buys out a number of smaller units, the former will be allowed to operate on the condition that it agrees to share a substantial proportion of its floor area with small retailers at a concessional rent. There are two unquantified elements in the above statement: substantial and concessional. What they signify in concrete terms will be left to a government servants discretion.

 These proposals not to put too fine a point on it are ridiculous. But there are more fundamental objections. The proposals assume that every retailer who is adversely affected by the coming of large-scale retailing will have to be accommodated one way or the other. This is to obstruct any kind of change. Competition means displacement; it also means that in a growing market economy, those who are displaced will find opportunities in other spheres. Further, the entry of large retailers will drastically bring down prices. This will mean that families will spend less on household items. The implication of this on the consumption of other goods, on savings and on investments is obvious. But the Left is unwilling to see reason because it refuses to abandon antiquated notions.

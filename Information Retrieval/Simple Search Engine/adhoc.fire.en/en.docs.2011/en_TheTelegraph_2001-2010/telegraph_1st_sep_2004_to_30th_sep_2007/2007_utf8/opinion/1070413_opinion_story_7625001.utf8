 Letters to Editor

 House divided

 Sir The Congresss defeat in the Delhi municipal elections was expected (BJP sniffs Delhi throne in civic victory, April 8). The sealing and demolition drives, in addition to the usual factors of anti-incumbency and infighting, made the Congress defeat inevitable. An inquiry should look into the full magnitude of the sealing drive. Big construction companies have benefited from the demolition since there has been a huge hike in the pricing of residential apartments and shop space at malls in and around the capital. Curiously, there were no takers earlier for a lot of this real estate. It seems that construction firms manipulated the large-scale destabilization of traders and residents by compromising their legal defence. Under these circumstances, the Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, cannot escape accountability for her partys defeat. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Persistent differences between the chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, and the Delhi Congress chief, Ram Babu Sharma, were mainly responsible for the Congresss defeat in the municipal polls. This should serve as a warning to the party. Only recently, infighting has cost the Congress Uttarakhand, Punjab and the Mumbai municipalities. If the party cannot get its act together, the divisive politics of the Bharatiya Janata Party will once more dominate north India. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Multiple dangers

 Sir The governments overhauling of the SEZ policy should increase transparency and reduce conflict of interests (Smaller, kinder SEZs, April 6). The cap of 5,000 hectares, with states having the freedom to lower it further, and the increase of the processing area in SEZs to 50 per cent should ensure that only serious players enter the field. The curtailment of the non-processing area will mitigate real-estate scams as well. Further violence, as in Nandigram and Singur, can be avoided by keeping the state governments out of the land acquisition process altogether. However, it may be difficult for private developers to acquire land without government support. While the Nandigram violence made the Centre appreciate the dangers of state acquisition of land, it still has to ensure a seamless implementation of economic policies and projects.

 Yours faithfully,

Chirag Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir After burning its fingers in Singur and in Nandigram, the government is toying with the idea of private acquisition of land. Although this is in tune with the Union governments new directives on SEZs and land acquisition, it is a dangerous plan and should never be implemented. The private sector operates only on the principle of profit and quick returns. This could result in poor farmers being forced to sell their land cheaply. Anyone who is aware of big private banks hiring goons to recover dues would understand the ruthlessness private firms are capable of. Promoters, too, often engage criminals to acquire property forcibly. If the ministry in charge of land and land reforms does not step in, armies of hired goons could soon be seen evicting farmers. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Perpetual mess

 Sir Achin Vanaik and The Telegraph must be congratulated for the bold indictment of Israel in A garrison state (April 5). Indians, having lived under colonial rule, should realize the injustice that the Israelis continue to inflict on Palestinians. After pushing the latter out of their own land, Israel now has the temerity to dictate to these dispossessed people how to conduct their own affairs. However, Vanaik does not mention that Israel came into existence to work as the Wests watchdog in the oil-rich Middle East. This will continue as long as the oil lasts, during which time the Palestinians must fight their daily battles for survival. 

 Yours faithfully, 

H.P. Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir Achin Vanaik gives only one side of the story. The biggest obstacles to a solution in west Asia have been the late Yasser Arafat and Hamas. The talks of 2000 between Bill Clinton, Ehud Barak and Arafat failed because of Arafats obduracy. Likewise, the peace process initiated by George W. Bush was stalled by the Hamas, although the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, wanted to see it through. Vanaik endorses the absurd Hamas claim that Israel does not have any right to the land. Hamass intention to sabotage the process is also displayed by its recurrent clashes with Abbass Fatah. But the Arab world continues to mouth platitudes and watch Palestines plight from a distance. The international community must persuade the Arab League to address the problem. India too should join the forum, given its good relations with both Israel and Palestine.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

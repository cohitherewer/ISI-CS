 ASPIRING GREAT 

 POWERS 

 Gwynne Dyer

 FIFTH COLUMN

 The 

 test would hardly have made the news outside of India if 

 the local air-traffic controllers had posted a warning in 

 advance, but when an Indonesian airliner had to turn around 

 in Indian airspace last Thursday and return to Jakarta to 

 avoid flying into the missiles path, it was bound to draw 

 attention. Now the whole world knows that India has test-fired 

 a nuclear-capable missile that can hit Shanghai and Beijing, 

 and a few people may be asking: Why? 

 The Agni-III missile failed its 

 first flight test last July, but this one seems to have 

 gone off well. The missile, which reportedly can carry a 

 300-kiloton nuclear warhead, was not tested at its full 

 range of more than 3,000 km on this occasion, but that is 

 the number that gets peoples attention. Indias main potential 

 enemy is Pakistan, and it already has missiles that can 

 strike anywhere there. The Agni-III gives India the range 

 to strike the Middle East (but it has no enemies there), 

 or southern Russia and Central Asia (likewise) or China.

 China is not Indias enemy either, 

 but there is a worrisome drift in Asian affairs, and the 

 Agni-III is just the tip of the iceberg. To be fair, China 

 has had missiles that could strike Indian cities for more 

 than 30 years now (though they were actually built to reach 

 American cities), so there is no monopoly of blame here. 

 And neither China nor India is planning to attack the other. 

 Theyre just doing what comes naturally for great powers.

 Why is India doing this now, thirty 

 years after China built its missiles? Because India, with 

 US encouragement, has finally decided, after half-a-century 

 of non-alignment, that it wants to play the great-power 

 game too. It has the resources these days, and its just 

 too galling to be left out when the Big Five get together 

 to sort out the world. 

 Old and new ties

 Theres more. American strategists 

 do not think that China intends to attack the US, but they 

 know that China is going to be the second-biggest economy 

 in the world in 10-15 years time. China is therefore a 

 potential challenger to Americas position as the worlds 

 sole superpower, and as such it must be contained. So, 

 for the past five or six years, Washington has been busy 

 renewing old military ties and forging new ones with countries 

 all around Chinas borders.

 Of those countries, the two most 

 powerful by far are Japan (already an American ally) and 

 India. Japanese right-wing politicians are tired of being 

 a special country that has forsworn the use of force in 

 its international relations (in the constitution that the 

 US wrote for it after World War II). They want to be a normal 

 country well, a normal great power, really so Prime 

 Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to rewrite the constitution 

 in order to remove those unreasonable restrictions on sending 

 Japanese troops overseas.

 And since India is now a normal 

 great power too, it is doing the things that great powers 

 do, like making alliances with other great powers. Specifically, 

 with the US, with which New Delhi signed a 10-year military 

 cooperation agreement in 2005. 

 When you go to Beijing and ask 

 Chinese officials how they feel about all this, they swear 

 that they are not going to panic. They understand that this 

 sort of thing is just the reflexive way that great powers 

 have always behaved, and that they know it doesnt mean 

 that the US, Japan and India are planning to attack them. 

 As long as they hang on to that thought no harm will come 

 of all this.

 But if they do panic at some point 

 maybe over some crisis in the Taiwan Strait, or the disputed 

 seabed between China and Japan, or some stupid incident 

 like the American spy-plane that collided with a Chinese 

 fighter in 2001 then all the pieces are already in place 

 for an Asian Cold War. That would be a serious waste of 

 half the worlds time at best, and a mortal peril to the 

 whole planet at worst.

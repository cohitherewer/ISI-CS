The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MORE BRITISH

 The keenness to look the Other in the face is now matched by the eagerness to hear the voice as well. But perhaps now the local authorities in Britain could not be blamed if they turn a less willing ear to words spoken in a language other than English. The recently-instituted Commission on Integration and Cohesion has the suspicion and the communities secretary, Ruth Kelly, endorses it that indiscriminate translations are not only depriving migrants of the incentive to learn English, but, and more importantly, paving the way for their segregation from the mainstream. Although translations, on which the nation spends millions of pounds every year, are still deemed indispensable in hospitals and other emergency services, the local councils have been advised to use more discretion in routinely translating, and thereby maiming foreign communities in the country. Migrants are now expected to learn the language (often at significant cost to their employers) and new entrants into the country to take English language tests in order to hasten their integration with the larger English-speaking community. 

 There can be no doubting the need to learn the predominant language of a country or a region for meaningful social interaction. One wonders if one could sail through life in north India without being able to speak a single word in Hindi. English is definitely a more cosmopolitan language and the most commonly used throughout the world. For years, Indians have spoken this language all over India without significantly corrupting their individual tongues. So there can be little reason to disagree with the logic of Britains integration commission that migrants in the United Kingdom would do themselves no harm in learning the language and using it to participate in the wider society while continuing to speak their first language. The niggling worry lies elsewhere. The demand for the learning of English has been voiced together with the need to show more Britishness. The desire, now restricted to the longing for a Britain Day or the hoisting of the Union Jack in the backyard, could become sinister if a more assertive Britain under Gordon Brown decides to undo what is seen as the damaging aspects of its multiculturalism. By the way, the integration commission steadfastly avoids using the last word, and goes local.

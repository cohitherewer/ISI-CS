The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Partners in a roaring business

 THIS ABOVE ALL - 

KHUSHWANT SINGH

 In search of love

 Come to think of it, we Indians are the worlds biggest humbugs. We enjoy making fun of others but do not like others making fun of us. Our humour is restricted to ethnic jokes about Sardarjis, Marwaris, Mian Bhais, Bawajis (Parsis), Makapaons (Goan Christians), Mirasis etc, and we have far too many self-appointed censors of morals who take umbrage at the slightest indiscretion committed by anyone and sanctimoniously pronounce fatwas on them. Two recent examples are Shilpa Shetty being warmly hugged by a white man, and Monica Bedi, a Sikh, having ek Onkar tattooed on her back. One has been taken to court, the other ticked off by the Jathedar of Golden Temple. Pathetic!

 All is not so grim in the Indian world of humour. There is a new publication, Whitewash: the Tabloid that is, about the Indian that isnt. It is authored by the architect, Gautam Bhatia, and illustrated by Nilanjana Das and Arup Giri. Its format is that of a periodical so I hope there will be other issues to follow. I suspect it derived inspiration from Britains fortnightly, Private Eye, which holds nothing sacred. In every issue, it goes for the royalty, the prime minister and his colleagues, the Church, the rich and the pretentious. It is littered with four-letter words beginning with F, C and S bugger being the most harmless of the lot. It is often hauled up in court for libel and forced to pay heavy damages. Its admirers bail it out.

 Bhatia knows his limitations and yet manages to make fun about everything Indian. He starts with a competition for the ugliest Indian politician. Entrants are Lalu Prasad, K. Karunanidhi, Harkishen Singh Surjeet and N. Chandrababu Naidu. He goes on to modern buildings dug out of volcanic ash: India Gate, Connaught Circus, Le Meridien and others. He has ads of Ayurveda and Yunani medicines to commit suicide and a do-it yourself electric chair press a button, and hey presto, you are in Baikunth! There is a Parsi sperm-bank to keep the race going. A lot of matrimonials, including some by animals: An ageing lion, good-looking from a distance, with golden mane, seeks lioness for roaring business. Leave messages at Gir Forest Rest House, Gujarat. Not to be left out is a monkey: Large baboon of the langoor caste, well settled on deodar tree, self-owned in Shimla, fully pledged snatch-and-eat banana on Mall Road. And so on.

 For a fun read you wont find anything funnier.

 A slice of Raj merriment

 Pran Nevile is versatile. Having finished with diplomatic assignments and globetrotting, hes got down to putting his reminiscences on paper. His first love is Lahore, the city in which he was born and educated. So he writes a nostalgic book, Lahore: A Sentimental Journey. Of Lahore, his most vivid memories are of its red-light district, Heera Mandi, known to the locals as Tibbi. It has survived onslaughts by puritanical mullahs and dictatorial regimes and continues to flourish. Many a student of his alma mater, Government College which is a few minutes walking distance from Heera Mandi continue to happily surrender their virginity there as they did in his days. I raise a toast to Tibbi Bazaar.

 As he aged, Pran Nevile went in from whores to nautch girls and courtesans, who entertained the British rulers and the Rajas. So he wrote books about them. Now that his appetite has mellowed a little, he has come up with a profusely illustrated coffee-tabler, Marvels of Indian Painting: Rise and Demise of Company School. There is really nothing very marvellous about Company School paintings, executed between 1775 and 1890. By and large, they are static, with more attention paid to dress, jewellery, drapery, borders and uniforms. Most characters in these paintings look sideways. You cannot discern any animation or expressions on their faces: no smiles, frowns or sadness simply deadpan blank stares. They were not artists, but craftsmen. That is why their drawings of birds like kestrels, hawks and kites are more life-like, in the style of Audbon prints of birds, than of humans. For good measure, but without excuse, Pran Nevile has inserted a few paintings from Ajanta and earlier times. It is a good coffee-table book to establish your cultural pretensions.

 Confusing poor natives

 English is a very tricky language

 One often stumbles over its usage.

 Its terminology dreadfully differs

 For a layman awesomely it offers

 The varied meanings of a single 

 word

 Makes him puzzled as hes never 

 heard.

 Lets take the word love the 

 divine passion

 But making love means plain 

 copulation.

 A light-fingered gentry are petty 

 thieves

 The meaning shockingly rattles

 ones weak ribs

 Anticipate and expect do not mean 

 the same thing

 The difference amazingly is quite 

 confusing.

 An woman of easy virtue is not a 

 pious lady

 But it means a slut of reputation 

 shady;

 Where whores dwell and by open 

 windows sit

 Is called a red-light district.

 What can poor natives make of it?

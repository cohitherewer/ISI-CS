The Telegraph - Calcutta
 City hold Leeds 1-1
Manchester: A late header by substitute Antoine Sibierski earned Manchester City a deserved 1-1 draw with Leeds United in an English Premier League match at the City of Manchester Stadium on Monday. City, who climb into a share of 11th in the table despite nine consecutive matches without a win, dominated throughout but only levelled the scores in the 82nd minute after Leeds had gone ahead with a first-half goal from Mark Viduka. It wasnt like they opened us up and I dont think the referee gave us many decisions, said City manager Kevin Keegan. In the end, though, I suppose youre happy to get a point. Keegan added that he had no choice but to bring on Sibierski in a bid for a late equaliser. He is very good in the air and he is a good goalscorer if you look at his record, he said. Australian international Viduka put Leeds in front in the 24th minute against the run of play, taking advantage of a defensive blunder by David Sommeil who failed to control a James Milner through ball on the edge of the box. Viduka had wasted a golden chance to score in the sixth minute when an Ian Harte free-kick left him unmarked inside the six-yard box. This time, though, he made no mistake, rounding keeper David Seaman for his fourth league goal of the season. City, however, dominated the rest of the half and had their best opportunity to equalise in the 41st minute when the dangerous Nicolas Anelka found Claudio Reyna unmarked just eight yards out. Reyna powered goalwards but defender Michael Duberry cleared off the line.  (Reuters)  Copyright

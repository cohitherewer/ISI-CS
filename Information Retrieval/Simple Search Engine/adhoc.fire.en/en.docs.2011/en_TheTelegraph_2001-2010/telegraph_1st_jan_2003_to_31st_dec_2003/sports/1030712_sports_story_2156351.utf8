The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ghavri to coach Bengal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Ending weeks of speculation, the CAB Friday appointed Karsan Ghavri as coach of the senior Bengal team for the upcoming season. The Mumbai-based Ghavri is expected to arrive in the city and take charge on July 22. He will accompany the squad to Bangalore for the KSCA meet, the Buchi Babu tournament in Chennai and the Moin-ud Dowlah meet in Hyderabad. The former India left-arm seamer was earlier appointed coach in 2001-02, but left even before the start of the Ranji Trophy, following his mothers illness. W.V. Raman then took charge. Im glad to be back with Bengal. Last time I had to leave midway but now Im available for the full season. My mother has been keeping well since and there should be no problem, Ghavri told The Telegraph from Mumbai. The Ranji Trophy remains my target, but if we can win any of the tournaments leading up to the premier tournament, it will be a morale-booster, he added. The players are not unknown, having worked with most of them during his previous tenure. He has also been following Bengals performance in the last two seasons. Ghavri, however, wishes to have a close look at some of the youngsters at the under-19 and under-22 levels. I believe they have been doing well and could come in handy. He also wishes to speak to Sambaran Banerjee, Bengals coach last season. Ill talk to Sambaran and get a first hand account of the players mental toughness and their abilities. Ashok Malhotra and Arun Lals views will also be sought, Ghavri said. There is talent and lot of potential in the current side. They only need to focus more on the game. Also performing as a unit will surely help them reach the top, he remarked.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harare gears up for Aussies
Harare: Police were maintaining a conspicuous presence in Bulawayo on Friday before Australias group A match against Zimbabwe on Monday. More than 30 uniformed officers, some in plain clothes, and motorcycle outriders were at the airport to greet passengers disembarking from Fridays first flight from Harare, which landed shortly before 8 am local time. The hotel where both teams will stay for the game was also heavily guarded. Police paraded the corridors, and taxis were obliged to pick up and deposit their fares outside the gates instead of at the front door as they normally do. At Queens Sports Club, where the match is taking place, about 30 police officers sheltered from the midday sun on a covered stand. Private security guards were also in evidence, and every entrance to the ground was manned by police.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

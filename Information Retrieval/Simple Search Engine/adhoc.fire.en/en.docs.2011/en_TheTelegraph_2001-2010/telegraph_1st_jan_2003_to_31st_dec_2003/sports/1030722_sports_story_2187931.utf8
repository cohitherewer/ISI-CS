 Armstrong extends lead 
Luz-Ardiden: Lance Armstrong defiantly shrugged of a crash with a spectator and another close shave to spectacularly win the 15th stage of the Tour de France here Monday and extend his race lead. Armstrongs first stage win of the race relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey after it looked under serious threat from Germanys 1997 winner Jan Ullrich and Telekoms Alexandre Vinokourov in the past two days.

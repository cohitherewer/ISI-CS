 Clijsters issues boycott threat 
Brussels: Kim Clijsters, the worlds No. 2 tennis player, on Friday threatened to boycott the Athens Olympics if the Belgian Olympic Committee does not allow her to play in her Fila-sponsored outfit. Clijsters said she would refuse to wear gear from Belgiums Olympic sponsor Adidas out of respect for her personal sponsor Fila. As long as my clothing remains an issue, it is impossible for me to go to the Olympics, she said in on her website. Even though I would like to go and even though I would be able to fit it into my schedule, she added.  (AP)  Copyright

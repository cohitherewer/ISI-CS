 India A thrashed 
 Bridgetown: Barbados inflicted an innings and 77-run humiliation on India A in their four-day West Indies Carib Beer series cricket match on Monday. With 262 runs still required to avoid follow-on, India A were bundled out for 185 runs in their second innings on the third day itself. T. Best was the wrecker in chief, claiming five Indian second-essay wickets for 60. Earlier, India A made 201 in the first innings, largely due to Gautam Gambhir (65) and J.P. Yadav (55). Murali Kartik was the most successful Indian bowler with his five-for-105 performance in Barbados first innings total of 463. Brief scores: India A 201 (Gautam Gambhir 65, J.P. Yadav 55; Ian Bradshaw 4/43) and 185 (T. Best 5/60). Barbados 463 (Floyd Reifer 105; Murali Kartik 5/105). Barbados won by an innings and 77 runs.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Marion Jones to miss world championships
 - Triple Olympic champoin and partner  Tim Montgomery expecting baby in July JONES: Intends to  be ready for Athens  Los Angeles: Triple Olympic  champion Marion Jones will miss Augusts world athletics  championships in Paris after announcing that she is pregnant. The 27-year-old American said  she and her partner Tim Montgomery, the 100 metres world  record holder, were expecting a baby in July. Were just very thrilled to begin  this new stage of our relationship and our lives, Jones,  who won 100m, 200m and 4x400m relay golds at the Sydney  Olympics in 2000, said. Ive always wanted to have a family  and Ive been blessed to have the wonderful family I already  have. Im so thrilled to say this now, so I can have a really  normal, normal pregnancy. Last August Jones said she would  target at least three gold medals, including the long jump,  at the Paris championships where she was hoping to avenge  her shock defeat by Ukrainian Zhanna Pintusevich-Block in  the 100 metres at the 2001 worlds. She was undefeated in 21 races  over 100, 200 and 400 metres in 2002, beating Pintusevich-Block  twice in the short distance. Jones says she intends to resume  training later this year to prepare for the 2004 Athens  Olympics. I plan to enjoy this experience,  she said. I dont plan to be on the treadmill and in the  gym at 40 weeks. Im a pregnant competitor. Being  pregnant doesnt take away from how competitive I am. I  look forward to watching Tim compete and seeing how the  ladies run at the world championships and I look forward  to getting back in training for Athens. The timing is great in terms  of when the baby will be born. Im confident Ill have plenty  of time to be ready in 2004. Montgomery, who began dating Jones  last year before setting a world best in the 100 metres  of 9.78 in September, has a daughter from a previous relationship. I couldnt think of a more beautiful  thing to share with such a wonderful person, he said in  a web-site report. Jones is not the first high-profile  track athlete to interrupt her career to start a family. Fellow American Evelyn Ashford,  a double-gold medallist at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, had  a daughter in 1985 and went on to win 100m silver and 4x100m  gold at Seoul in 1988. She also won a relay gold in Barcelona  in 1992. Valerie Brisco-Hooks also returned  from motherhood in 1984 to become the first athlete to complete  a 200 and 400m Olympic double.

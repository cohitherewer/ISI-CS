The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Sunday, October 19, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 The Bengal probables had a four-hour session with Soumitra Chattopadhyay, a professional motivator. In what was a rare move, the CAB invited Chattopadhyay  a regular motivator in the corporate world  to lecture the players and support staff, including coach Karsan Ghavri.				 																																																	This was the first time I and even the players attended such a session must say it was quite interesting, Ghavri said. The former India allrounder admitted there are quite a few things which could be picked up and used effectively in sport. He spoke very impressively and provided several examples from tennis, athletics and the corporate world to explain how to control yourself in stressful and problematic situations, Ghavri said. Chattopadhyay will have a second session with Ghavri and his boys on Monday afternoon.				 																																																	 The IFA will henceforth be returning the Rs 15,000 it charges all clubs as registration fee to recruit a foreign footballer. The decision to introduce this foreign player recruitment subsidy was taken at Saturdays finance committee meeting. Clubs will thus now have to shell out just Rs 15,000 to hire a foreigner. This has been done to make the Calcutta League more attractive and crowd-pulling, said IFA secretary Subrata Datta.				 																																																	Meanwhile, the November 2 Super Division play-off final between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan has been confirmed. The match will be shown live on ETV.				 																																																	 Ramit Tandon added one more title to his growing kitty when he lifted the national sub-junior squash title in Chennai on Saturday. 				 																																																	According to information received here, the city boy saw off Delhis Ravi Dixit 9-3, 9-7, 9-4 in the final. 				 																																																	 South Calcutta shut out South Suburban 67-43 to enter the mens final of the first senior inter-district basketball championships at Burdwans Aurobindo Stadium. 				 																																																	The womens final will pit hosts Burdwan against North Calcutta. North beat South 67-39 in an all-Calcutta clash while Burdwan overcame South 24 Parganas 40-26.

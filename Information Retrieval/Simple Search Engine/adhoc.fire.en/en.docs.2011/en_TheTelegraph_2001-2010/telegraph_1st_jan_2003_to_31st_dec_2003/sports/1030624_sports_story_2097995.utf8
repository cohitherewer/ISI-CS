The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Port Trust hold Tolly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami salvaged a point from a tie they should have won in what was practically their opening encounter in the CFL Super Division, against Calcutta Port Trust at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium Monday. Port Trust took the lead through Sujit Dey in the 53rd minute and Amit Das replied for Tollygune five minutes later. Tollygunges first match against Railway FC was abandoned Friday. Port Trust moved to two points after three matches. Tollygunge, under Subrata Bhattacharya, were clearly the better side. They created more chances and in comparison, made the more purposeful moves. They came close on several occasions after the equaliser, and could have fished out the winner had youngster Gouranga Dutta shown a cool head near the goal. The ground was slippery, but by no means unplayable. The teams operated at a reasonable pace, though the first half was insipid. The match came alive for a few minutes after the first goal. It resulted from a well-orchestrated move. Srimanta Das started it by releasing Amar Pyne down the right and the former sprinted past Shamsi Reza before essaying a low cross. Sujit ran in and was in perfect position to slot home a first-timer. Port Trust erred at this juncture as they refused to slow down and went ahead with their open game. Tollygunge punished them when Prakash Karmakar took advantage of the room offered down the right and sent in a floater which was expertly headed in by Amit. Tollygunge continued to exploit the open space on both flanks in the rival half and Gouranga reached the danger zone down the left on at least two occasions. However, he tried to shoot home from difficult angles rather than passing on to his teammates, placed comfortably inside the box. The Tollygunge coach didnt blame his wards for failing to collect full points. Many of our experienced players are unavailable, including foreigners Isiaka Awoyemi and Akim Abolanle. Also, we have had little time to practice. Despite that, I am pleased with the way my boys ran on this slippery turf and the number of chances they created. We should have won.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Today, our cricket has more of aggression and less of sentiment: Ajit Wadekar
 - Personally, I like Sourav Gangulys captaincy and the fashion in which he has injected the killer-instinct  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Ajit Wadekar in the city on Thursday.  Picture by Santosg GhoshCalcutta: A history-scripting captain, immensely successful coach A former selection committee chairman too Clearly, Ajit Wadekar has worn more than one hat with distinction: The solitary Indian captain to win back-to-back series overseas (West Indies, England) and the only one to have beaten the West Indies on their home turf Later, as coach, he recorded a 68-plus success percentage in Tests and over 61 in the ODIs That will take some beating. Actually, 29 years after quitting cricket and seven years after ending his term as coach (incidentally, no one has gone beyond his three-and-half years), Wadekar is happy that the present Team India is professional and aggressive. Today, theres more of aggression and less of sentiment in our cricket Theres lot more money as well and, with that, has come an awareness about the game alone providing the bread and butter, is how one of Indias most revered sportsmen, now 62, put it, shortly after arriving here (from Mumbai) late on Thursday. Speaking to The Telegraph, he added: Its been a slow process but, yes, I see a greater degree of professionalism Were getting closer to Australia Having a foreigner (John Wright) as coach has helped and Sourav (Ganguly) has been leading with purpose. At the same time, generally, we shouldnt get carried away. Wadekar elaborated: Ive read that Prakash Padukone and Geet Sethi will be lecturing the players in Bangalore While I respect both Sethi and Padukone, what on earth can they tell a Sachin Tendulkar? Surely, its Sachin who ought to be lecturing the shuttlers and cueists. Talking specifically about Wright (who is two months short of completing three years) and Sourav (who has logged three-and-half years), he said: The coach hasnt been weighed down by any emotional and sentimental baggage  that has given him a free hand As for Sourav, he has backed the juniors and, in turn, got the seniors support. The captain is seen as a guide and, in Sourav, the players have somebody tall to look up to Personally, I like his aggression and the fashion in which he has injected that killer-instinct. Looking ahead, to the 2003-2004 season which begins with the two (home) Tests against New Zealand, Wadekar commented: No matter how innovative the Black Caps preparations, playing India in India is never going to be easy Ill be surprised if we are pushed around Of course, the scenario will be different once we tour Australia (from late November) However, provided we dont get overawed, we should be able to give a good account of ourselves In fact, we must remain aggressive, without going over the top I mean, our bowlers shouldnt think of doing everything at the same time  something they attempted, with disastrous consequences, in the World Cup final. Will sledging be a factor? Laughing, he responded: Thats the Australian way of scoring a point or two and wont ever change. Really, they care two hoots about As Ive said, we must not get overawed Nor get flustered The focus should be on cricket  we must be aware of both our strengths and limitations The Australian intensity, though, is remarkable Did we face sledging? Look, those days were different I dont think anything more than the occasional four-letter word was ever exchanged Asked whether he favoured continuing with makeshift openers (like Virender Sehwag) in Tests, Wadekar answered: Not at all The mental make-up of specialist openers is different from the other batters and, at the top of the order, its important to have batsmen with a clear mind. However, he endorsed the Sourav-Wright decision of convincing Rahul Dravid to keep in the ODIs. Initially, I did have reservations Yet, with time, Dravid has improved and its beyond debate that he balanced the XI beautifully (in the World Cup) The good thing about Dravid is that hes serious about everything In the larger interest, then, he could continue, Wadekar suggested. That line has quite a few takers. Incidentally, Wadekar has lent his name to a little-known but praiseworthy organisation  the All India Cricketers Association for the Disabled. He has been its president since it was founded in 1988.  Copyright

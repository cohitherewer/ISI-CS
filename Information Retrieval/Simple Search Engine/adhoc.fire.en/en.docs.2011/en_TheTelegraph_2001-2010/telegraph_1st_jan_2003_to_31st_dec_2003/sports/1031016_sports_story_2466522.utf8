The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rio has to be punished, says Fifa
 - Defender may face 2-yr ban
 Fifa expects FA to come down heavily on Ferdinand London: Fifa has warned that Rio Ferdinand will be punished if the English Football Association (FA) lets the Manchester United star off for missing a drugs test. The warning comes from Michel DHooge, head of Fifa medical committee and the man in charge of their anti-doping programme. This is a serious case. Ferdinand certainly has to be punished, he told British media. Fifa is waiting to assess whether a serious sanction is forthcoming  one which fits the infringement. We will let the English do their work first. If everything is correct we wont have to do anything. But the Belgian insisted he expects the FA to come down heavily on the England defender. The World Anti-Doping Agency regulations call for a two-year ban but DHooge said Fifa uses their rules as a guideline. We are applying individual case management in these circumstances. The sanction could be less than two years or it could be more. DHooge said Ferdinands case will be discussed during a Fifa executive board meeting in Qatar at the weekend. The 30 million Ferdinand  accompanied by lawyers from Old Trafford  was interviewed for two hours by FA compliance officer Steve Barrow on Monday. The 33-cap England star admitted missing the drug test at Uniteds training ground on September 23 but insisted he simply forgot. Uniteds lawyers pointed out Ferdinand had offered to undergo a test as soon as he realised his mistake and provided a negative sample two days later. The Premiership champions are pushing for a charge of missing a drug test which would be punishable by a hefty fine and a brief suspension.  But, if Ferdinand is hit with  the more serious charge of wilfully missing a drug test,  he could be liable to a ban of up to two years. FA chiefs  who axed Ferdinand from Englands final Euro 2004 qualifier  against Turkey last Saturday are still deliberating over  their course of action. (AFP)  Copyright

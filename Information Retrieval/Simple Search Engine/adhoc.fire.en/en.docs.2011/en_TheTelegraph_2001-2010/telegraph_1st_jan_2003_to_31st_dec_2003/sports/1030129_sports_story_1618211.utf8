 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 JADEJA																								Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Tuesday confirmed it had received the award of the Delhi High Court-appointed arbitrator in the Ajay Jadeja case and that it had sought legal opinion on the decision to quash the five-year ban on the allrounder.																								In a statement, BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya said: The BCCI is given to understand that the award will be enforceable only 90 days from the date of its receipt, under Sections 34 and 36 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. The matter being extremely sensitive and in view of the fact that decisions were taken by a Disciplinary Committee consisting of the then president, Dr A.C.Muthiah as well as the then vice-presidents, Kamal Morarka and K.M. Ram Prasad, the present office-bearers of the BCCI would refrain from taking any decision unilaterally. The matter will be referred to the working committee, he said.																								Dalmiya stated that in the interim period of 90 days, the BCCI will take the following steps:																								n Obtain a legal opinion from its lawyers, Harish Salve, Gopal Subramanium and U.N. Banerjee, who were engaged by the BCCI in arbitration proceedings.																								n Obtain the views of the then Disciplinary Committee members.																								n Obtain the views of K.Madhavan, former CBI chief, who was appointed BCCI Code of Conduct Commissioner and attended the arbitration proceedings.																								n Ascertain whether the legal validity of the award should be tested or not																								All the facts and reports will be placed before the working committee and its decision will be final, Dalmiya said.																								Verdict gives Malik hope 																								Meanwhile, banned former Pakistan captain Salim Malik on Tuesday welcomed the overturning of a ban on former Indian star Ajay Jadeja for match-fixing and said it should help him fight his life ban from the game, adds Reuters from Karachi. I am really very happy to hear that Jadeja is relieved and he may revive his cricket career and am confident this will help me in my fight to quash a life ban, Malik said.

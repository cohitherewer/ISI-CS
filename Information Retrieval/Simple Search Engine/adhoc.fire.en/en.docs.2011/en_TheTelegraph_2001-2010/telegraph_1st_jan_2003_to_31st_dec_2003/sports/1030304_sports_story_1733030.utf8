The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Windies set to go through the motions
 			Kimberley: Kenya and the West Indies play their final World Cup league match here on Tuesday with the result having no significance in the race for the Super Sixes.That is how it was supposed to be in the group B calculations, except that it is Kenya who have qualified for the next round while the West Indies go through the motions.The only hope for Carl Hoopers side was if Canada had upset New Zealand. That didnt happen and the likes of Brian Lara can start packing. Crickets a funny game, anything can happen, but we know we are out of it, Hooper said even before the last ball had been bowled in the New Zealand-Canada clash.It will be hard to motivate the boys. But we will still try and win. Its still a one-day International and more importantly, it is a World Cup game.Also, the West Indies will not want to suffer the embarrassment which Richie Richardsons men went through in the 1996 World Cup when they lost to Kenya in Pune.The Kenyans, on the other hand, are flying high after becoming the first non-Test playing nation to qualify for the Super Sixes. They deserved the spot after a shock win over Sri Lanka.They will eye a second big scalp to push their case for Test status even further.Tikolo hoped Kenyas performance, irrespective of Tuesdays outcome, will help their cause. The ICC should take notice, Tikolo said. Our performances here have shown that we are worth more international matches and they will definitely be a boost for Kenyan cricket  as you can see from our shirts, we dont even have a sponsor.

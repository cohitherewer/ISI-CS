				 	 Steve: Wont stay for sake of statistics																								Sydney: Steve Waugh said on Tuesday there was no point continuing his glorious career just to satisfy fulfilling statistics.																								The 37-year-old Australian Test skipper said after Mondays final Ashes Test he would reflect on his position over the coming weeks. 																								Waugh can retire on his own terms after a magnificent 102 in the first innings which buried suggestions that he was not worth his place.																								Theres no point in just going on for the sake of it and playing just for the numbers or the stats or whatever. The only one who can make the decision is myself and Ive got to consult with the people around me, particularly my family, and work out what the best decision is.																								Ive got to see whether theres still a challenge out there, thats the reason why I play cricket, whether I can still improve and whether theres a point to it. 																								He had indicated previously that he wanted to return to play in India in 2004 and try to win Australias first series there in more than 30 years.																								But so perfect was his innings, where he scored a four off the last ball of the day to raise his century, that there is a compelling case for Waugh now to be considering stepping down from the game.																								Ive been doing it for 18 years now so Ive just got to weigh up all those issues and try and make the right decision but I still love playing for Australia. Losing three wickets for 50 the other day in a tough situation, I realised that I still wanted to play cricket.																								Meanwhile, Waugh has withdrawn from the Don Bradman XI to play England in Wednesdays one-day match because of a groin strain. It is a minor strain but it was felt prudent for him to miss the match to avoid increasing the severity, Australian team physiotherapist Errol Alcott said.																								His twin brother Mark, who retired when he was dropped for the first Ashes Test, will captain the side. A statement from the Australian Cricket Board said Waugh had sustained the right groin strain while bowling in the final Test. (AFP)

 Bengal face daunting task
	 - RANJI TROPHY Jaipur: Rohit Jhalanis hit a solid 85 as Rajasthan set Bengal a tough target on the penultimate day of the four-day Elite B Ranji Trophy match here on Sunday. Rajasthan, who had taken a first innings lead of 135, declared their second at 268 for five, largely due to Vineet Saxena (59) and Anshu Jain (53). Chasing a victory target of 404, Bengal lost an early wicket to be at nine for one at stumps with Devang Gandhi (4) and Amitava Chakroborty (4) at the crease. Earlier, resuming their second innings at 32 for one, Rajasthan consolidated with Jhalani dominating the opposition bowlers with some fine strokes all around the ground. Except for Sourashish Lahiri, who returned with figures of three for 69, no Bengal bowler could put any pressure on the Rajasthan batsmen as they piled on the runs before declaring their innings. Bengals chase got off to a poor start when Deep Dasgupta was trapped leg before by P. Krishnakumar for a duck. Bengal, who still need 395 runs for a win, will have to survive 90 overs on Monday to force a draw.  (PTI)  Copyright

		 Saturday, January 04, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 The IFA is trying to postpone the IFA Shield final by a day to January 21. The idea is being toyed with because both semi-finals have been slated on January 19, which gives the finalists no rest between the two matches.				 																																																	A senior IFA official, however, wasnt very sure about the shift. The President is expected to visit the city on January 21, which means the police will find it difficult to deploy enough number of security personnel, he said Friday.				 																																																	The IFA has also decided to raise the per-match participation money to Rs 25,000 from 20,000. The cash award for winning each match has also been increased to 25,000 from 20,000.

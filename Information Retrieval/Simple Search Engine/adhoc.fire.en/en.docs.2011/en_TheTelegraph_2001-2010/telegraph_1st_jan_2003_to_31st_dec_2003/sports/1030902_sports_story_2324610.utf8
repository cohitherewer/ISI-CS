 BCCI calls for overhaul 
Bangalore: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) technical committee on Monday called for an overhaul of the ICC points system for multinational one-day tournaments to avoid deliberate under-performance by teams. Technical committee chairman Sunil Gavaskar said the committee felt that a losing team which did not concede a bonus point to the rival side should not be given a point, and a losing team which did concede a bonus point, should be slapped with a penalty point. This is to avoid a situation in a tri-series where a team which has qualified gives away a bonus point to the side they want to play in the final. So, we feel there should be (provision) for penalty point, he said. Gavaskar cited the example of tri-series a couple of years back, where such a thing happened. BCCI secretary S. K. Nair, who was also present at the meeting, said the points system in the coming one-day series involving India, New Zealand and Australia would, however, be held according to the existing rules subject to the review which would take place during the proposed ICC meeting in Mumbai on September 17 and 18. The committee said the playing conditions for the series against New Zealand and the following tri-series will remain the same. There would be one exception however, with the one-dayer between New Zealand and Australia in Guwahati beginning at 8.30 am instead of 9 because of the light factor. The committee also recommended that lights be switched on at a specific time during the day-night matches. Meanwhile, the technical committee has also recommended that the under-19 national tournament be given first-class status from the coming season.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Sania to hone serve, fitness
 Sania Mirza Pune: Sania Mirza plans to get her serve and fitness honed up during her forthcoming three-week stint with renowned German coach Bob Brett in Italy. The prodigy said Monday: I have a long way to go. Therefore I plan to utilise this stint fully and improve my serve and fitness during this stint. Sania hopes to improve her ITF ranking from 396 by several notches in the near future. She, however, has no immediate plans of playing in a tournament abroad. Commenting on the newly-acquired celebrity status, Sania said she was getting used to living under the arclights. The junior Wimbledon doubles champion holds both Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi in high esteem and doesnt feel her style is cramped while playing with them. They are quite down to earth and accommodating, she added. Sania also felt theres quite a lot of talent in the Indian womens circuit. Theres talent among the crop of young Indian players like Isha Lakhani, Ankita Bhambri, Kartiki Bhat and a host of others. Its just a matter of time and exposure that they require. I am quite confident all of them will do well in due course, she said.  (PTI)  Copyright

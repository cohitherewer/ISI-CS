 Anand tips for kids willing to turn pro 
 Indian chess is looking up, says Anand Chennai: Grandmaster Viswanathan Anand, the man who inspired a generation to take to chess, has cautioned children under the age of 12 against turning professionals and advised parents to allow them lead a normal life. I am happy at the manner in which the Indian junior and sub-junior talents are winning tournaments, still the parents should keep in mind the danger that exists at these levels. The players should not become professionals at under-10 and 12 but enjoy their normal life, he said here on Friday. On the increasing number of GMs and WGMs from the country and the number of tournaments held to improve sub-junior and junior talent in India, Anand said: Indian chess is looking up. We would really improve if more GM tournaments are held in India and opportunities are created for these talents to blossom. Reviewing his own performance, Anand said he would be totalling 2775 elo points in next months rating. But to touch the magical 2800 mark would be difficult as it was not easy to accumulate the remaining points in one go. It is rather too much to bridge the 25-point in a single tournament. Earlier, Anand launched the GNIIT scholarship for 2003-04. Listing out his schedule for the rest of the year, Anand said he would be concentrating on improving his skills in rapid chess besides training for the regular tournaments in the European circuit. Anand also said he would not opt for a dual passport and would remain an NRI. I possess only an Indian passport though I am an NRI. I do not want to go in for the dual passport when it is implemented, he said. Anand, who has been spending more time in the country these days trying to help aspiring champions, said his plans to start a full-fledged chess academy might happen only after his retirement. I am presently involved with the NIITs Mind Champion academies being set up at schools across the country spotting and nurturing players online, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

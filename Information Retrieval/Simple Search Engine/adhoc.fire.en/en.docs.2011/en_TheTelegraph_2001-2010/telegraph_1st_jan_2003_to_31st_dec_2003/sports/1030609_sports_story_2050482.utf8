The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain gets armchair captaincy role
 Fletcher wants to use Nasser Hussains experience Chester-le-Street: England will call on Nasser Hussains experience as captain during their upcoming one-day campaigns even though he has retired from the shorter version of the game. Hussain, frustrated by the politics surrounding Englands boycott of their World Cup match against Zimbabwe in Harare, called time on his one-day career after the tournament. But England coach Duncan Fletcher said: We will definitely use Nassers experience during the one-dayers. Its good to have people from outside looking in because you can get a bit blinkered. England take on Pakistan under new captain Michael Vaughan in three one-day Internationals this month before playing South Africa and Zimbabwe in a triangular event. In keeping Test captain Hussain involved, Fletcher will need to be careful not to undermine Vaughans leadership of a new-look one-day squad following the retirements of Nick Knight, Alec Stewart and Andy Caddick as well as Hussain. Fletcher, however, added that Hussain, who never flourished in the limited-overs format wit h a single century in 88 matches, could still contribute from the sidelines. Its good to have someone with recent experience of international cricket and where the game is going. Even if its only one idea a series, that could be the idea that wins the series. Many see Vaughan as a future Test leader as well but Hussain, now with 17 Test wins to his credit and only one behind Mike Brearley and three behind Peter Mays record 20, clearly has no plans to give up that job yet. Under him, England won four series in a row in 2000-1, including the first series victory over the West Indies for 31 years and rare away successes in Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The win over Zimbabwe, however, followed just one Test series win in the last seven.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its nice to know that Im not a victim of the worst case scenario: Paes
	 - Starting with the Good Lord, Ive got to thank over a billion people  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Leander Paes with father Dr Vece Paes during a press conference at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center on Monday. (AP) The speech was just a trifle slurred, otherwise Leander Paes sounded fine when he took time off to return a call (via father Dr Vece Paes cellphone) from The Telegraph early on Tuesday. In perhaps his first interaction with a hometown-based Mediaman, since being admitted to the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Orlando, Leander spoke for around 15 minutes. Its unclear how soon he can return to India, but Leander has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of concern on a national scale. Indeed, he said as much.  The following are excerpts On his state of mind Very relieved Its nice to know that Im not a victim of the worst case scenario Ive been lucky Of course, at the moment, Im sedated and so the speech is slurred That apart, Im feeling good. On his thoughts when, last week, it was suspected he had a brain tumour That first thought was (After a pause) Actually, being the son of a doctor, I knew the implications and, if it was a tumour, wanted to know its size and the mode of treatment I could appreciate what I would probably have to go through Still, I was determined to keep my chin up  after all, thats the way I am Looking back, then, I took the initial fears well but, yes, there were moments when I was all alone and Thats when On the past week or so (Laughs) Quite like a rollercoaster ride, in terms of the diagnosis First, they talked of a tumour Then, it was an abscess Later, it became a parasitic infection I was relieved only when the Atlanta-located Center (for Disease Control) confirmed an infection On the medical fraternity in India bombarding his father with suggestions It was overwhelming So many doctors either called, e-mailed or communicated via SMS However, Im specially indebted to Dr B.S. Singhal, who is head of neurology at the Bombay Hospital His initial diagnosis itself was spot-on and he sent some medication over with my father In fact, Dr Singhals diagnosis helped the Orlando doctors, particularly the ones who specialised in infectious diseases. On all of India joining in the prayers for his speedy recovery Starting with the Good Lord, Ive got to thank over a billion people! From the President of India to so many whom Ive never met and probably wont ever meet Prayers, pujas The South Club gesture (of a prayer meeting last Saturday) also touched me Thats where I grew up, as a tennis player, and Ive forever treated it as my second home. On Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar having been distressed by the initial reports I read your story from Bangalore, about Sachin and the others praying for my well-being That gave me more courage, made me more determined to come through whatever I would eventually be diagnosed with It was a big boost I have a lot of respect for our cricketers and, when somebody of Sachins stature expresses such concern, how can I not be moved? Through your columns, I wish to specially thank him and Sourav. On talk that he even managed a game or two of the odd sport last week Oh, no With the risk of seizure, theres no way I could have exerted myself Ive been doing light sit-ups and yoga. On and off, I meditate as well. That has a calming influence. On whether Mahesh Bhupathis gesture of flying over to Orlando (from New York) will help bring the two together again on the pro circuit I do appreciate what Mahesh did He spent three hours at the hospital and his gesture touched me At the same time, while we make an effort to play as a team as often as we can, we do have commitments with our regular doubles partners (on the circuit) As is known, Mahesh and I would have played together in Long Island, had my illness not played spoilsport. On the legendary Martina Navratilova deciding not to play mixed doubles at the US Open without him (Emotionally) I dont think I can ever have words to describe Martinas affection for me and the influence she has had on my career I regard her as a spokesperson not just for tennis, but mankind The other day, before the confirmation from Atlanta, I promised Martina that I would pull through this illness and again be her partner, in 2004 For me, playing with her has always been a huge opportunity to learn. [While Martina has been in regular contact with Leander  they are the reigning Australian and Wimbledon champions  she hasnt yet visited him at the hospital. A few days ago, a TV channel had incorrectly reported that Martina and Bhupathi had gone to Orlando on the same day.] On ladylove Mahima Chaudhary being by his side She left Mumbai within four hours of getting to know I may have a serious ailment Her presence has been a source of inspiration and, really, Im thankful to the entire Chaudhary family for moral support at a difficult time in my life Indeed, Im also thankful to Mahimas producers and directors who gave her leave at such short notice. Its generally believed that the film industry treats its stars as public property and not human beings who can and do have emotions. Well, I definitely dont subscribe to that Will she continue to stay? Now that my illness isnt serious, probably not. Finally, on the expected date of his release from hospital Going by the doctors opinion, I will have to remain for anywhere between 8-21 days Even after that, Ill have to stay in the US for some weeks. While the treatment has started, the response of my system will obviously have to be monitored. An early return to India, therefore, is ruled out.  Copyright

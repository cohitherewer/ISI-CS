The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pole for Schumacher 
 Michael Schumacher at a press conference in Melbourne Saturday. (Reuters) Melbourne: World champion Michael Schumacher roared to pole position for Sundays Australian Grand Prix as Formula Ones rules revolution threw up a familiar Ferrari front row sweep. Schumacher, winner in Melbourne for the past three years, clocked a fastest lap of one minute 27.173 seconds under the new single-shot qualifying format to start the season just as he finished the last  leading the field. Brazilian Rubens Barrichello, fastest in Fridays opening session that determined Saturdays running order, will start alongside his German teammate after lapping 0.245 slower on the decisive day. After months spent rewriting the rulebooks in a bid to revive flagging television audiences and cut costs after a year of Ferrari domination, there was no change at the top. The outcome left Schumacher, still using a version of last years all-conquering F2002 car, and the world champions as firmly in the driving seat as ever. The gap between Ferrari and the rest remained huge, with Schumacher 0.928 of a second faster than third-placed Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya in a Williams. I dont think anyone really expected a whole different scenario and Ferrari suddenly being in the middle of the field, although if you make a mistake it could easily happen, Schumacher said. Germanys Heinz-Harald Frentzen was fourth in a Ferrari-powered Sauber with Toyotas Olivier Panis fifth. It was Schumachers 51st career pole, although qualifying is now about strategy more than pure speed with cars running on different fuel levels as a result of the new rules banning refuelling before Sundays start. The pole was also five-time champion Schumachers third in a row after qualifying on pole for the last two races of 2002.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

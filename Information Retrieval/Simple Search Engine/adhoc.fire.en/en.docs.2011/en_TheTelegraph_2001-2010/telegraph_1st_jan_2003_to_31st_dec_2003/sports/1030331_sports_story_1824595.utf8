				 																																	London: Peeved over the national selectors decision to ignore him for next months Sharjah meet, former Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell has announced his retirement from international cricket.				 																																	Campbell, who was overlooked for the World Cup but later brought back to replace an injured Mark Vermuelen for the Super Six match against Kenya, is the fourth Zimbabwe player to retire since the World Cup. The other three were Andy Flower, Henry Olonga and Guy Whittal.				 																																	I made the decision to retire because the selectors gave me the impression that I was also surplus to requirements for the England tour (in May), the 30-year old batsman was quoted as saying by the BBC sport website.				 																																	I always thought that a batsmans best years are between 28 and 36. At 30 I was looking forwards to the best years of my international career. But the selectors forced my hand and that was obviously not ideal for me.				 																																	Islamabad: In the wake of Britains participation in the US-led war on Iraq, the Pakistan Cricket Board has sent an official to England to review security arrangements ahead of the countrys proposed tour in June.				 																																	A PCB official said the visit by Zakir Khan, general manager, cricket operations, had been necessitated by IRA threats in the United Kingdom, recent bomb threats and blasts in London and Britains involvement in the Gulf War.				 																																	We just want to be sure that if Pakistan plays in England our players dont face any security problems there because of these issues, the official was quoted as saying.				 																																	Pakistan will play three ODIs besides some warm-up games, which are not part of the regular England season.				 																																	Though the PCB sources cited security concerns for sending the official to England, news reports here suggested that the mission was undertaken as a retaliatory measure for what England did in 2000.				 																																	Key Biscayne: Larry Scott, who has worked for the ATP Tour for the past 11 years, has been hired as chief executive officer of the WTA Tour.				 																																	Scott, 38, was introduced at a news conference on Saturday before the womens final at the Miami Open. He said he hopes to improve the strained relationship between the mens and womens tours, as well as relations with the Grand Slam tournaments and International Tennis Federation.				 																																	London: The England and Wales Cricket Board ECB is to talk to other sports in a bid to avoid a repetition of the Zimbabwe World Cup controversy, according to the Sunday Telegraph.				 																																	The ECB is to present a document to the Football Association (FA), Rugby Football Union (RFU) and the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) on April 7 to get early government approval for matches in what the paper described as morally questionable countries.				 																																	 n Golf, Best of PGA from 8.30pm on ESPN n Soccer, Premier League from 9pm on ESPN n Tennis, ATP Masters series from 11am on STAR Sports

 Justine to end year as No. 1
 Justine Henin-Hardenne Los Angeles, Nov. 8 (AFP): Justine Henin-Hardenne added another prize to a glittering season that included triumphs at Roland Garros and the US Open on Friday: the year-end world No. 1 ranking. It is just amazing, because the season has been great, the 21-year-old Belgian said Friday after a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Jennifer Capriati that gave her both the season-ending No. 1 and a semi-final berth at the elite WTA Tour Championships. I won two Grand Slams. I did everything almost perfect. So it is great to finish the season No. 1. I cant believe it right now, I dont realise it yet. Meanwhile, defending champion Kim Clijsters, who is already into semi-finals, completed round-robin play undefeated, rallying to beat Frances Amelie Mauresmo 3-6, 6-4, 6-4. Clijsters has already qualified for the semi-finals, while the fate of Mauresmo, who finished the first phase 1-2, hinges on Chanda Rubins match on Saturday against Elena Dementieva. Henin-Hardenne, who becomes just the eighth woman to hold the year-end No. 1, staked her claim to be considered the top womens player in the world with victories over Clijsters in the finals of the French and US Opens, just two of her eight titles in 18 events this year.

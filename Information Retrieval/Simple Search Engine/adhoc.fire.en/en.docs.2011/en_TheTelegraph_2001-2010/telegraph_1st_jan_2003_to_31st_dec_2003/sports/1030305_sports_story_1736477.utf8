The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Patil keen on returning
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  PATIL: I will be happy to accept any assignment Cape Town: Sandeep Patil, currently Kenyas coach, is keen on returning to India. Patil, Indias coach for around six months in 1996, is on contract with the Kenyan Cricket Association till the end of the on-going World Cup. Kenya have qualified for the Super Six and face India in their opening game, at Newlands, Friday. Strictly informally, Ive already spoken to the Board of Control for Cricket in India chief (Jagmohan Dalmiya) and will be happy to accept any assignment, Patil told The Telegraph Tuesday evening. Speaking from Kimberley, where Kenya played their last league match, Patil added: It should, of course, be clear that Im not angling for any specific job... Rather, as Ive said, Ill be happy to make a contribution at any level... [The present Indian coach, John Wright, is also contracted till the end of the World Cup. However, with Team India recovering splendidly after being thrashed by Australia, it will be a surprise if Wright isnt offered an extension.] Patil, it may be recalled, was replaced by Madanlal after a furore caused by his role in dropping Sourav Ganguly during the inaugural Sahara Cup, in Toronto. Sourav had then just come off a great summer in England and his exclusion didnt go down well with important members of the Establishment. But, then, that is something of the past. Incidentally, Patil has been with Kenya from after the 1999 World Cup. He succeeded Alvin Kallicharran.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Monday, March 10, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	London: The biggest reason why India is the only team which can stop the Australian juggernaut at the World Cup is Sachin Tendulkar.				 																																	So feels the British media which said India was gaining a merciless streak and was best-placed to prevent the Australians from winning their second consecutive title.				 																																	There is conclusive reason for fancying India to harry Ricky Pontings Australians  Sachin Tendulkar, said The Independent Sunday. It would be the crowning moment of a magisterial career if Tendulkars runs could help India into the final and give them victory.				 																																	In a column in The Sunday Times, former Australian skipper Steve Waugh also felt that Tendulkar can lead India to their second World Cup triumph. India are on an upward trend, and, to me, on course for a final showdown with Australia. They have a chance to win their second World Cup because of Sachin Tendulkars form and that of their quick bowlers, Steve wrote.				 																																	Bloemfontein: Chris Cairns comeback to bowling has been tentative. But, the big allrounder is happy he took his time, and hes eyeing off some prized Australian batsmen.				 																																	Cairns had knee surgery a year ago and his first forays back into medium pace werent an overwhelming success; his first over in 12 months costing New Zealand 21 valuable runs against the West Indies at Port Elizabeth on February 13.				 																																	Against the Zimbabweans he was again expensive in his first over, and got frustrated. But he persisted and it paid, collecting the wickets of Craig Wishart and Guy Whittall to finish with two for 16 off four overs. 				 																																	Its been a long while coming, but its nice to be getting the rewards for a lot of hard work in practice, said Cairns. And to get some match play bowling-wise, it was great to be back at the bowling crease.				 																																	We identified that we probably need two wins out of three to go through, weve got a big game next against the Australians, theyre playing very well, so were going to have to be on top of our game, said Cairns.				 																																	Durban: In a bid to cash in on the success of the Indian team in the World Cup, the South African Airways has introduced an unprecedented ten additional flights between Mumbai and South Africa to ferry four thousand cricket fans to the country.				 																																	Originally we were looking at 3,000 passengers, but the number has increased by another 1,000 after India qualified for the Super Six, said Riba Govender, a spokesperson for Interglobe, the company which manages the route between the two countries.				 																																	If India makes the final there is talk of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee flying into the country. The introduction of additional flights has gone beyond expectations, Govender said.				 																																	There are also Sri Lankan fans who will fly to India and then to South Africa because there are no direct flights from Colombo.				 																																	Johannesburg: A South African radio presenter has been suspended from his job after making a series of insulting remarks about the Sri Lanka team following their dramatic tie which knocked the hosts out of the World Cup.				 																																	The Sri Lankan manager Ajit Jayasekera branded Daryl Ilbury a lunatic for his comments which included describing the Sri Lankan team as vermin and that they should get out of our shores.				 																																	The DJ added that the players have long stupid names. 				 																																	We do not deem it worthy to demand an apology, Jayasekera told The Sunday Times here.				 																																	n India vs Sri Lanka, live from 1 pm on DDI and live from 1.30 pm on Max n India vs Sri Lanka highlights from 10.30 pm on Max n India vs Namibia highlights from 10 am on Max n Extraa Innings from 11.30 am on Max.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rafiq Ali in lead
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 22: Rafiq Ali shot his second successive round of four-under 68 to move into the lead at the Rs 16 lakh Surya Nepal Masters in Kathmadu on Saturday. After the second round, Rafiq was eight-under 136, one clear of Digvijay Singh, who added a 68 for a tally of seven-under 137. Overnight leader Uttam Singh Mundy managed a poor two-over 74. That put him in tied third place along with Delhis Pappan at five-under 139. The cut was applied at 12-over 154 and 52 professionals made it to the money-making round. The three-round competition gets over on Sunday. Rafiq, who was ill and struggling with his swing a week before the Hero Honda Masters, looked like opening up a huge lead before a couple of late bogies stopped his march. Six-under for the day with four holes to go, he made bogeys on the sixth and eighth.  Copyright

 Tikolo requests tax-waiver
 Steve Tikolo Nairobi: Kenya captain Steve Tikolo has pleaded with the government to waive taxes on the teams prize money for reaching the World Cup semi-finals. Tikolo said the team were perturbed at how slowly the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) was pursuing the issue when the Kenya shilling continued to gain against the US dollar. We are not at war with KCA (Kenya Cricket Association) but this delay is a matter of concern to us after such a sterling performance, Tikolo said on Tuesday. We are worried because we have not been getting any information from KCA regarding our money. Kenya, who beat Test sides Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh on their way to the semi-finals, earned $530,000 prize money.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Bengal  Real pressure comes when you drift from present: Srinath
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Johannesburg: At 33, Jawagal Srinath isnt getting any younger, yet he has rarely bowled better than in the last few months. The senior pro, unusually candid, spoke to The Telegraph the other morning. The following are excerpts Your thoughts, having competed in four successive World Cups Going back in time is like going back in history... Of course, Test cricket is the real stuff, but the World Cup is very special too... Im glad I could go through four. More glad that Ive been in the XI which beat Pakistan in all four editions. Your first World Cup (1992) Personally, I was raw and, teamwise, I dont think we were prepared... Having already spent over three months in Australia, we were tired... By the time we realised what was happening, we were out of the tournament. The next two In 1996, the sole high point was ousting Pakistan in the quarter finals (Bangalore). Otherwise, though we made the semi-finals, I regard that campaign as a disaster... Indeed, 1999 was no better. Did we have the team to win in England? No... We made a lot of mistakes  for instance, we shouldnt have lost to Zimbabwe in Leicester  and paid heavily. The pressure associated with a World Cup At the international level, the pressure is the same... The World Cup is different in that its not like a five or seven-match series... Clearly, you cant come back after losing a couple of games... For a team to be successful, in an event like the World Cup, mistakes must be at a minimum. Presenting a rejuvenated look for the past few months (Laughs) Things havent been bad... Last year, I was burned out in the West Indies... The workload coupled with the flat wickets took the sting out of me... In the past few months, specially, my experience has come in handy... Ive been reading batsmen better and, then, Ive been clear about the teams requirements. One must compromise as one gets older and, even if Ive lost pace, Ive kept the right line and length. Your quitting of Test cricket after the (Test) series in the West Indies More than anybody else, I knew what I could and couldnt do... (After a pause) Looking back, the communication wasnt proper... There was, after all, a reason why I didnt wish to play... People should understand a fast bowler can get tired. Also, I didnt want a situation where I played simply to get selected. Whats disappointing is that some people created the impression I was picking and choosing. That was incorrect  in fact, if anybody does that, he is neither being fair on himself nor on the team. Bottomline is spacing your cricket, not choosing and picking... I felt let down by some people. Whether you regret not going to England Yes, I would have enjoyed that trip... Like Ive said, the communication (on returning from the West Indies) wasnt proper... There was no assessment of my strength, nobody talked about the role I could have... I became an issue and the issue wasnt well handled. Turning out for Leicestershire towards the end of the last county season If I had to stay in contention for this World Cup, I had to stay in shape. Thats why I took up that end-of-season contract. The dramatic return in the Champions Trophy final last September The captain (Sourav Ganguly), some of the seniors and even the selection committee chairman (Brijesh Patel) spoke to me and I decided on flying to Colombo after being clear about my role. Its this interaction which made me return to Test cricket as well (home series against the West Indies). I wasnt looking for any favour from anybody, all I wanted was an honest appraisal of where I stood. The pressure factor when you returned to Test cricket (in Mumbai) Look, the pressure is always there... I also couldnt stop people from talking. Your 12 years of international cricket Ups, downs... Ive seen everything... Ive learnt... Where do I stand today? I will reassess everything after the World Cup but, as Ive already told you, I dont have much cricket left. (Adds smiling) It would be great if I had the mind of a 33-year-old and the body of somebody 23. Handling pressure Real pressure comes about when you drift away from the present... Its more pronounced when you begin living in the past or start worrying about the future. Its best to live in the present and look to giving that hundred per cent and more. Its not possible to do better than that. Everybody wants to be a winner and, to be one, you need to be consistent. Whether the downs left you frustrated No. Whenever Ive failed, Ive blamed myself... At the same time, whenever Ive done well, Ive never thought Im indispensable. Your comments on Ashish Nehra and Zaheer Khan Both are good, both are willing to listen... Its not always easy listening to others because, at the end of the day, its your mind and body... I pick out the few right things Ive done in life and pass them on... What has seen you through these 12 years? My mental strength... Ive never ever got carried away with success, never ever got bogged down because of failures. Ive been honest with myself, with the team. Thats the reason, perhaps, why I dont have regrets. Whether in 1997, after the shoulder surgery, you feared your cricket would be over? Did cross my mind, but nothing more... Now, at least, we have a full-time physio and physical trainer... Back in 1997, injuries werent taken seriously and there was nobody to monitor either a problem or rehabilitation. Your forthcoming tie-up with Durham Things have progressed, but let the World Cup finish. Whether you are indebted to anybody... Its a long list... Im most thankful to my teammates, though. But for their confidence, I wouldnt have got to where I am. Whether any one batsman has made you work harder Its when you arent bowling well that every batsman becomes a demon. Finally, about your hero Imran Khan... His batting, bowling, captaincy... I was bowled over by everything. Of course, I admired Kapil Dev too.  Copyright

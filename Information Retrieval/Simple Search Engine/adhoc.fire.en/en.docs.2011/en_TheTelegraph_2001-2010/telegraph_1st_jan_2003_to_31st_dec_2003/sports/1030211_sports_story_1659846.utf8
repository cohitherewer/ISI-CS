The Telegraph - Calcutta
 My No. 1 one-day hundred, says Lara
  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Chris Gayle and Vasbert Drakes celebrate their victory over South Africa at Newlands Sunday Paarl: Dropping Steve Waugh during that crucial Super Six game in 1999 remains an albatross around Herschelle Gibbs neck. The immediate reaction then had been: Gibbs has dropped the World Cup. After Brian Laras superb 116 at Newlands, in Sundays 2003 Cup opener, Jacques Kallis will be praying he isnt weighed down similarly. That century not only facilitated a stunning win by the West Indies  though Sourav Ganguly, for one, doesnt think it was an upset  it made a million South Africans skip multiple heartbeats. While South African captain Shaun Pollock didnt talk of that let-off, Lara himself felt a first-ball dismissal wouldnt have done justice to the hard work put in over the past couple of months. Lara, it may be recalled, was rendered hors de combat (owing to suspected hepatitis B) during last Septembers ICC Champions Trophy and missed tours to India and Bangladesh. The World Cup-opener, therefore, was his comeback match. It couldnt have gone better  and MRF couldnt have hoped for a more mileage-generating start to crickets biggest show ever. Not surprisingly, Lara picked his Newlands knock as the best among his 16 one-day hundreds. Given the position we were in and keeping the larger perspective in mind, its my No. 1, the genius-like left-hander pointed out. Lara acknowledged making a comeback wasnt easy, but regularly working indoors (in Trinidad) helped him immensely. I knew I had to push myself, returning to a team full of confidence and hungry to do well... I wanted to play my part in giving the West Indies the best chance of winning the World Cup... This, after all, is the tournament, the world stage... Carl Hooper, the West Indies captain, complimented Lara and confirmed that the move to field seven batsmen would, for now, continue. Later, speaking to The Telegraph, a smiling Hooper insisted he wasnt much bothered that just about everybody had largely been talking about Australia and South Africa only. Irrespective of what others may say, we know what our job is... A programme has been in place and the results are showing, Hooper observed, typically not going overboard. As for Pollock, the strain showed on his tired face and it will surely be some time before he can reconcile to having been docked one over. Whatever the hold-ups, the buck stops with the captain if the overs stipulation isnt complied with. But wont it be tough to recover from such an early setback? No... We are a proud bunch and can lift ourselves... As captain, Ive now got to get the best out of the guys, Pollock responded, possibly aware that his survival as captain perhaps hinges on the South African show in the quadrennial showpiece.

Wimbledon: Former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek withdrew from the tournament Tuesday just hours after the draw. The Dutchman pulled out with an unspecified injury, referee Alan Mills said. Krajicek was drawn to play a qualifier in the first round. Krajiceks withdrawal was announced shortly after he lost 4-6, 6-7 (4-7) to Olivier Mutis in the first round of the Ordina Open in Rosmalen, The Netherlands. Henman surprised Meanwhile, British number one Tim Henman admitted Tuesday he was pleasantly surprised after being seeded tenth for Wimbledon. Henman is currently ranked 29th in the world but his grasscourt pedigree  four-time semi-finalist at Wimbledon  has been taken into account by the All England Clubs championship committee. Im pleasantly surprised to have been moved up as high as I have been considering my ranking is currently 29, Henman said. Although its great to be seeded, Ive still got to play well, he added.

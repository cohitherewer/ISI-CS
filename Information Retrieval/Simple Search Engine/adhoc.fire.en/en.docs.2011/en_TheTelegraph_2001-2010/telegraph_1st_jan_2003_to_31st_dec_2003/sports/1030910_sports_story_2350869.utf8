		 Wednesday, September 10, 2003  Calamint may beat Lockers Park 
 BY STAR RACER Vijay				 										Calcutta: Calamint may upstage Lockers Park in Wednesdays main event, the 1,400m Hovercraft Cup for horses in Class II. The mare from Vijay Singhs yard was an impressive winner in her last start over an identical trip.

Vijays Thrilling Proposal is the other one who may win the Best Of All Cup.

 Bagan boot out coach Subrata
  BY A STAFF REPORTER SUBRATA: Anti-football activities Calcutta: The Subrata Bhattacharya era at Mohun Bagan has come to an end. His four-year stint ended in ignominy Tuesday, when club officials handed the pink slip to one of the most successful coaches of recent times for anti-football activities.Addressing the media at the club tent, Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra charged the coach with inciting the players to boycott the last two National Football League matches without their dues being cleared.It is an assault not only on Mohun Bagan but on the game itself, the secretary said.

But this action of his is beyond explanation.Though the coach was present in the bar pujo (which takes place on the morning of the Bengali New Years Day), nothing was told to him then. However, the letter, drafted in the afternoon and signed by Mitra, stated his stint as the coach is terminated with immediate effect. Meanwhile, the officials informed that the junior team coaches Bidesh Bose and Shyamal Banerjee will be asked to look after the team for the last two National League matches against ITI and HAL, and if they do not take the responsibility, it will be handed  Copyright

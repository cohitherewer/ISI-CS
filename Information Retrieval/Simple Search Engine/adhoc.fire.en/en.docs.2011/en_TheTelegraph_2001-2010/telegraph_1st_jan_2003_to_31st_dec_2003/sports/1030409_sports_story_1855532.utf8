 Doping will never disappear, says Rogge
Athens: International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge admitted Tuesday that sports would never totally win the war on drugs. But he said enormous strides were made at last months world drug summit in Copenhagen to cripple the plague. We accept that doping will never totally disappear. But what we have to do is put in place as many means as possible and to reduce the evil to the lowest possible level, he told the Kathimerini daily. And were making major progress with the Copenhagen decision. Sports officials and government representatives approved last month in Copenhagen a new all-encompassing global anti-doping code with a mandatory two-year ban for doping offenders in all sports barring exceptional circumstances. The world anti-doping agency (Wada) wants to bring the code into operation in time for the 2004 Athens Olympics. Rogge played down the prospect of cloned world-beaters in the future. It is a danger, he said of cloning. It is not an immediate danger. I can assure you by saying that there is no athlete being cloned today. It is not the doomsday scenario that people describe. Rogge warned that baseball, softball and modern pentathlon would not survive if they did not change. It depends on the sports themselves, he said.  (AFP)  Copyright

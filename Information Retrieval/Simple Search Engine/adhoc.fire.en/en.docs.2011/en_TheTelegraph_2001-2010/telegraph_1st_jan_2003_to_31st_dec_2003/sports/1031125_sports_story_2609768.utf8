The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ eves start on winning note
Mumbai: New Zealand womens cricket team started off its 25-day tour of India with an eight-wicket win in the two-day match against the Board Presidents XI on Monday. Needing 50 to win with eight wickets in hand in the 90-over-a-side match, the visitors romped home in the 37th over without losing any further wickets. New Zealand skipper Maia Lewis, remained unbeaten on 45 off 77 balls in 98 minutes with eight hits to the fence. Though the visitors reached their target of 109 runs off just 36.4 overs, they continued to bat for the full quota of 90 overs as they wanted some batting practice before the one-off Test against India at Vapi in Gujarat from November 27 to 30.

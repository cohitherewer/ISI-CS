The Telegraph - Calcutta
 174 confirm for Bhubaneswar 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: One hundred and seventy four participants, from 51 schools, have confirmed for the Bhubaneswar leg of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, which gets underway at the gymnasium cum indoor hall at Saheed Nagar, Tuesday. The tournament, one of its kind in India and probably also in Asia, is being organised by the Orissa State Chess Association in association with Alekhine Chess Club and has attracted 149 boys and 25 girls. The 11-round meet, to be played under the Fide Swiss Rules, ends Sunday. This is the third edition of the Bhubaneswar leg. As in previous years, the top five from this leg of the competition will make it to the grand finals to be held in the city in the first week of August. The final leg is expected to be an event in which players can score Fide rating points. The Guwahati leg of this competition got over Sunday and the Jamshedpur edition will be played at the end of this month. Kiran Manisha Mohanty is the top seed, while two six-year-olds  Rakesh Nayak and Ankita Dash  are the youngest participants in the Bhubaneswar leg.  Copyright

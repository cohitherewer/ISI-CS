 Grant, Hondo back in ODI squad
London: Zimbabwe have welcomed back experienced allrounder Grant Flower and seam bowler Douglas Hondo to their one-day squad for the tri-series with India and hosts Australia early next year. Flower missed the recent series against Australia and West Indies with a broken finger while Hondo has been missing since he damaged a thigh muscle in the opening game of the Australian Test tour in October. Zimbabwe coach Geoff Marsh said: Its good to see a highly experienced player like Grant Flower back in the side after a long injury lay-off.

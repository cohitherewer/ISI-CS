Bengals Sourav Chakraborty clinches the boys singles and paired with Arunava to win the doubles crown. Sourav also won the gold in the mixed doubles.

Berlin: A Bundesliga match between Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg was postponed Saturday due to ice on the stands and the approach to the stadium.				 																																	The German city of Moenchengladbach, which owns the local soccer stadium, decided to call off the match because the ice posed a danger for spectators. No new date had yet been set, the Bundesliga said. 				 																																	Tokyo: Lindsay Davenport has given Martina Hingis a no-nonsense piece of advice, telling her injured Swiss rival: Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Hingis, who underwent ankle surgery last May, delayed her latest comeback by pulling out of the Australian Open, fuelling speculation that the 22-year-old could retire from tennis. But Davenport said the problem was more mental for Hingis, who has gone four years without a Grand Slam title. I think, mentally, she just doesnt want to be out there losing to players she had never lost to before, the American said. 				 																																	Springbok: South African doubles tennis player Jeff Coetzee has been seriously injured in a car accident in which his five-year-old nephew died, a family friend said Saturday.				 																																	Coetzee, 23, was driving home to Okiep Friday with his sister and her two sons when their cars tyre burst, the players mentor and assistant Bruce Davidson said.				 																																	The vehicle went out of control and hit a concrete barrier, rolling several times before coming to a standstill.				 																																	Maseru: Lesotho coach Monaheng Monyane has resigned, blaming his departure on conflict with the countrys football association, officials confirmed on Saturday. It is the second time that Monyane has quit the post and follows Lesothos 6-0 thrashing by Gambia in their African Nations Cup qualifier last October. Monyane took over as coach in May 2002 but won just one of his six matches in charge. 				 																																	His previous spell as coach ended in August 2000 after a player strike over bonus payments when Lesotho were surprise qualifiers for the final of the regional Cosafa Castle Cup. They lost 6-0 on aggregate to Zimbabwe in the final. 				 																																	Lesotho next play on April 6, when they travel to Mozambique for their first-round match in this years Cosafa Castle Cup. 				 																																	Barcelona: Argentine international defender Juan Pablo Sorin will join Barcelona in a loan deal from Lazio until the end of the season, the Catalan club said on Friday.				 																																	Barcelona said that they will have an option to buy the player when the deal expires in June this year. A spokesman added that they plan to hold an official presentation this weekend after the final details of the deal have been agreed. The 26-year-old wing back, who was part of Argentinas 2002 World Cup squad, will help strengthen a Barcelona defence that has been plagued by injury problems this season.				 																																	Barcelona also confirmed on Friday that Yugoslav coach Radomir Antic will take over the coaching duties at the club until the end of the season.

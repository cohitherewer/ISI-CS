The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav awaits his big Cup debut day
 Kumble likely to replace Harbhajan  - Younis Khan may come in for Elahi FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Anil Kumble during  practice in Centurion Friday  Pretoria: Thirty two months  is a long time in sport, perhaps more so when it comes to  India- Pakistan cricket. Saturdays game in neighbouring  Centurion, therefore, is going to have an additional flavour   that of renewal. That will surely come with unusual  baggage. But, then, no Indo-Pak match has ever been an ordinary  affair. Given the build-up, its no surprise that both captains   Sourav Ganguly and Waqar Younis  spoke about the need  to not go overboard before a sell-out crowd at SuperSport  Park.  For Pakistan, of course, the four  pool A points are a matter of life or death  indeed, the  treatment back home is such, theres nothing in between.  For India, the pressure is much less, but full points will  confirm a Super Six ticket. Actually, who needs to do what  was reflected in the mood Friday. While the Indians were  coolly professional in their workout, Pakistans schedule  was hit by monsoon-like showers (in Centurion). Already  tense, the team headed back to Johannesburg. It couldnt  be confirmed if alternative arrangements were worked out. Pakistan have struggled throughout  the World Cup, while India have got their act together after  being smashed by Australia (at SuperSport Park itself) a  fortnight back. With three wins on the trot, the last being  a most emphatic one versus England, the Indians are on a  high.  For Sourav, its all about keeping  the momentum. Less happily placed, Waqar is praying his  players hit form. Quite the wrong time to pray but, then,  the Pakistan captain has no choice. Incidentally, the Indian XI is  set to have just four faces from the side which lost to  Pakistan in the last game  by 44 runs in a Asia Cup fixture  (Dhaka) on June 3, 2000. Besides Sourav, Sachin Tendulkar  and vice-captain Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble should also be  there. For his part, Sourav believes  the present team is a much better one-day unit. We field  sharper and the bowling is much superior... Clearly, the  captain had Zaheer Khan and Wednesdays hero Ashish Nehra  in mind when he talked about the bowling. Thirtytwo months ago, Sourav was  still new in the hot seat. Today, he has led across the  world. As captain, then, will his own feelings be any different?  Smiling, Sourav told The Telegraph: If I myself  take the match differently, I wont be able to ask the players  to try and treat it as they would any other game... But,  yes, the toss will be a big moment. Sourav, it may be recalled, missed  the last India-Pakistan match in a World Cup (Manchester,  1999) owing to injury. Centurion will see his debut.  To return to the Indian XI, its  as good as assured that Kumble will replace Harbhajan  Singh. In recent times, Harbhajan has been getting the nod  in a one-spinner-only scenario, but he hasnt been incisive  in the tournament and theres this feeling that the hugely  experienced Kumble (240 appearances) is required in a tight  game. That apart, as already reported  in these columns, Mohammed Kaif and Dinesh Mongia will swap  places. As of late Friday, Kaif will bat at No. 4, with  Mongia going three slots lower.  Pakistan have a big problem with  out-of-form players, but even they could make just one change:  Younis Khan replacing Saleem Elahi. Whatever the eventual  composition, will Pakistan be able to correct the World  Cup imbalance (vis-a-vis India)? For now, at least, Waqar is living  in hope. Well, theres always a first... Weve never beaten  India, but... In fact, for a change, India take to a Pakistan  game with a higher billing. Shoaib Akhtar can target all  11 but, after Kingsmead, India will be difficult to beat. The weather, though, shouldnt  spoil a rare show. For, till the politicians and generals  get out of the habit of constantly no-balling each other,  a Sachin versus Shoaib duel will remain a rarity.

 Mankad run ends
Bangalore: Harsh Mankads fine run ended Friday when he lost in the semi-final of the Indian Oil Servo ATP Challenger to Frenchman Gregory Carraz.  The 23-year-old from Mumbai had his chances but failed to deliver when it mattered most, going down to the second seed, 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (6-8) in an absorbing two-hour encounter. In the end, the booming serves of the 28-year-old Frenchman made the difference. Mankad, who was the lone Indian left in the fray, started on a promising note breaking Carraz, but dropped his own serve immediately. In the tie-breaker, Carraz was outstanding, giving no chance to Mankad. In the second set tie-break, Mankad staged a comeback after being 1-4 down. Carraz, however, his nerve and walked away with the match. Carraz will meet eighth seeded Gilles Elseneer of Belgium in the final, who beat Ivo Heuberger of Switzerland 6-3, 3-6, 6-1. Meanwhile, the duo of Yves Allegro (Switzerland) and Jean-Francois Bachelot (France) made the doubles final beating Noam Okun (Israel) and Arvind Parmar (England) 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-5) in the semi-final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inzamam wary of SA backlash
 Inzamam suffered a hamstring injury in the second game Faisalabad: Inzamam-ul-Haq is wary of a tough fight from South Africa in the remaining three one-day Internationals after Pakistan won the first two games in Lahore. South Africa is a world-class team and we know that big teams always come back strongly in a five-match series, said Inzamam, who suffered a hamstring injury in Sundays 42-run victory and stated he had only a 50-50 chance of playing Tuesdays match. But so far we havent made many mistakes and I hope we would keep the good work going, the skipper added. Inzamam gave credit for the two victories against Graeme Smiths team to his bowlers after South Africa failed to chase totals of 277 and 267 despite getting solid starts. Our bowlers, especially (Mohammad) Sami and Shoaib (Akhtar) have done a wonderful job, and I hope they continue to deliver in the remaining three matches, he said. Pakistan have included Naved Latif in the squad in case Inzamam doesnt recover in time. Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria also got a call-up after Mushtaq Ahmed pulled out after pulling an abdomen muscle. Youhana-Hall exchange During the Pakistan innings, Yousuf Youhana and Andrew Hall got involved in a verbal exchange. The pair clashed in the 13th over of Pakistans innings and replays suggested after the batsman exchanged words with Hall, he was elbowed as he took a single. Hall then confronted him, touching his bat and thrusting his face in Youhanas, who responded angrily before umpire Nadeem Ghouri stepped between the players. Umpire Darrell Hair cautioned them both. However, Inzamam said no complaint would be filed with Match Referee Clive Lloyd. We want to play a good series against South Africa. We dont want to get involved in any controversy. Its a team decision not to lodge any complaint, and the chapter is closed, the captain said. On Sunday, PCB chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia and chief executive Rameez Raja said on television that the Pakistan team would be filing a complaint with match referee Clive Lloyd. But PCB sources said the Pakistani team management had changed its mind to avoid bad blood with the South Africans. Smith promised some real good cricket from his team, although the Proteas have badly missed hard-hitting opener Herschelle Gibbs who is yet to recover fully from a pulled stomach muscle. Morne van Wyk, 24, has been summoned as Gibbs replacement and may get a chance in the only day game of the series. We are going to play some real good cricket from now, Smith said. In the first two matches, the South African middle-order failed to capitalise on good starts. The visitors were 137 without loss in the first game before being restricted to 269 for six. In Game 2, the visitors were 107 for one before managing only 225 for nine. We shot ourselves in the foot, Smith said. The South African captain was furious with three run-outs on Sunday  Neil McKenzie, Mark Boucher and Shaun Pollock. With three stupid run-outs, we were out of the game within 20 minutes, Smith said.

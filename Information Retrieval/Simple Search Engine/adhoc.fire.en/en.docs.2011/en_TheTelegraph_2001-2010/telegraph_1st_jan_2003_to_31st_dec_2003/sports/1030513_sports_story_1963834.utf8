 Akram Khan calls it a day
Dhaka: Former Bangladesh captain Akram Khan announced his retirement on Monday from international cricket after 15 years with the national team. Khan, 34, who led his side to victory at the 1997 ICC Trophy in Malaysia, said he had taken the decision for family reasons. After making his debut for the national side at the 1988 Asia Cup in Dhaka, Khan scored 259 runs in eight Tests with highest score of 44. He scored a Bangladesh record 976 runs in 39 one-day Internationals. His most memorable innings was a match-winning knock of 67 not out against The Netherlands in a 1997 ICC Trophy match which took his team into the semi-finals.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

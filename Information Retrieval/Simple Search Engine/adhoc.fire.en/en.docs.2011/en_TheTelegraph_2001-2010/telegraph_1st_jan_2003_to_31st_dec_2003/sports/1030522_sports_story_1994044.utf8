The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Uefa Cup for Porto
Seville: Porto won the Uefa Cup on Wednesday when Derlei Silva scored a dramatic silver-goal winner five minutes from the end of extra time to give them a 3-2 victory over 10-man Celtic. The Brazilian striker lashed home his second goal of the night to settle a thrilling encounter at the Stadio Olimpico to give Porto their first European trophy since 1987. Celtic had recovered from 0-1 and 1-2 down as Swedish striker Henrik Larsson twice cancelled out goals for Porto by Derlei and Dmitri Alenitchev in normal time. The Scottish side were then rocked five minutes into extra time when defender Bobo Balde was sent off after earning a second yellow card. Derlei made them pay with his 12th goal in the competition this season just when a penalty shootout was looming as Porto became the first Portuguese club to lift the Uefa Cup. Celtic did not manage to test Porto keeper Vitor Baia until the 22nd minute. Henrik Larsson won a free kick on his first run and smacked in a shot that Baia did well to hold.

 Zimbabwe fight back
 - Taibu, Matsikenyeri defy West Indian pacers  Fidel Edwards scalped three Zimbabwe wickets Harare: Wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu struck a career-best unbeaten 75 to lift Zimbabwe to 284 for six on the first day of the first Test versus West Indies on Tuesday. Taibu, who scored his second Test half-century, and Heath Streak, 16 not out, shared an unbroken partnership of 51 to help the hosts recover after losing wickets at regular intervals after winning the toss. Fast bowler Fidel Edwards was the pick of the West Indies attack with figures of three for 73 from 17 overs on a hot, humid day on a pitch offering little encouragement to the seamers. The best of the batting came in a sixth-wicket stand of 79 between debutant Stuart Matsikenyeri, who scored 57, and Taibu. Debutant Vusimuzi Sibanda edged two fours before finding the middle of his bat in the sixth over when he hit Edwards through square leg and the covers for consecutive fours. But he snicked the next ball, an expansive drive, to Jacobs to be caught behind for 18. Trevor Gripper and Mark Vermeulen tried to consolidate, but in the tenth over Vermeulen, on eight, was tucked up by a rising leg side delivery from Edwards and sent a looping catch to Wavell Hinds at short leg. Five overs later Zimbabwe slipped to 58 for three when Stuart Carlisle drove recklessly at a wide delivery from fast bowler Corey Collymore and was caught by Brian Lara for eight. Grippers patience stood out in the face of his teammates lack of it, but in the eighth over after lunch he edged fast bowler Jerome Taylor to first slip for 41. Wishart was in fluent form and stroked six boundaries in his 47, but his rash drive off Hinds midway through the second session flew straight to Jacobs. Matsikenyeri and Taibus partnership ended when Matsikenyeri flashed outside the off-stump at Edwards to be caught behind. (Reuters)  Copyright

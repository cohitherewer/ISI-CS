 BRIEFS
 for a pleasant surprise on Sunday when the Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone met him during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone.Ecclestone showed keen interest in Chandhoks career and discussed the future of drivers from Asia and India in particular. His advice and guidance was invaluable and as a driver it is fantastic to know that a man at that level is lending his support to me. He also introduced me to some of the drivers, which was great, Chandhok said in a statement on Sunday. Ecclestone also took Chandhok on a visit to the grid which pleased the Indian no ends.I must say I was really excited about it since the F1 grid is a very reserved area. The atmosphere was just something unbelievable with the stars in their cars pulling up onto the starting of the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC), died on Monday. Davies, 65, won a bronze medal in the 1,500 metres at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and collected a silver in the mile at the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth. He died after a long battle with cancer, the NZOC said in a statement. After he retired from competition, Davies coached several top athletes before becoming president of the NZOC in October 2000. NZOC secretary general Barry Maister said Davies epitomised the Olympic ideal.He was dedicated to a belief that sport was more than has signed a two-year contract extension that will keep him at the Italian first division club until June 2008. Its deeply satisfying and demonstrates the clubs faith in me, said the 29-year-old Italian international. Everyone knows how much I want to wear this Milan shirt and I am very happy because Ive spent here two wonderful seasons and now I can end my career here. It was my dream, it took me just five minutes to sign the new contract. I put my signature on a blank contract, I trust in the club, I will never have problems early on Monday after a fatal fall during a floor routine at the Cameroon national gymnastics championships. Yvette Moukouri, president of the Cameroon Gymnastics Federation said: quot;The incident happened during a floor routine. Alim Hassan landed on his forehead and fractured the bottom of his skull. The 24-year-old, who died after being rushed to hospital, was from the WTA Bank of the West Classic here Sunday, the Wimbledon winner complaining of pain in her left knee. Williams won her second consecutive Wimbledon title two weeks ago and was to have been the top seed here when play opens Monday in the first US hardcourt tune-up event for the US Open. Obviously, Im very disappointed that I cant play at Stanford, especially because it would efforts to form a confederation for governance of all sporting federations has run into deep trouble with many accusing it of trying to interfere in the selection of teams.Sports minister Ngconde Balfour had announced last week that his department would initiate the establishment of a confederation to bring all the 142 sports federations in the country under one organisation. However, the move has been condemned by the White community. Sport on screen

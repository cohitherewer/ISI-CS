The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I wont rush my return: Harbhajan
 - Off-spinner almost passed out on being shown the surgery photographs  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Things will be clear after the stitches are gone, says Harbhajan Melbourne: Harbhajan Singh, who underwent surgery on his right index finger last Friday, will have the stitches removed on December 29. However, he is likely to remain here for a couple of weeks after that as well. Rehab ka sawaal hai... How things stand should be clear once the stitches are gone, Harbhajan told The Telegraph on Monday evening. Earlier in the day, the surgeon (Greg Hoy) conveyed his happiness over the off-spinners recovery. That was communicated when Harbhajan, accompanied by Team India physio Andrew Leipus, called on Dr Hoy for the first time since being operated. Actually, he almost passed out on being shown the surgery photographs! Mujhse dekha nahin gaya... My head started spinning and I had to be given water... The surgeon, of course, pointed out many patients cant stomach that... Maine kaha, bhai, sab Leipus ko hi dikha do, Harbhajan, whose arm is in a sling, remarked. Reflecting, while watching Pinjar on a DVD player (loaned by a friend) in the hotel, he accepted it would have been better had he undergone surgery in the off season. Jo aadmi sochta hai, woh hota nahin... I thought I would pull through the home series against New Zealand and the commitments in Australia... At that time, Pakistan had not been cleared... Harbhajan added: Everybody is saying Im going to miss a big series (in Pakistan) but, then, every engagement is important... For instance, playing just one Test on this tour is such a disappointment... In any case, main ab kya kar sakta hoon? But, one thing is sure, Im not going to rush my return... The (end February- mid April) tour of Pakistan apart, he wont be available for the Asia Cup/ trip to Bangladesh for two Tests and a series of ODIs. As Harbhajan will resume bowling in five months  the outer limit, mind you  his comeback should be in the tri-series tentatively billed for late August in Holland. World champions Australia and Pakistan are going to be the other teams in that warm-up for the September 10-25 Champions Trophy in England. Incidentally, as part of the build-up, India will also be playing three ODIs versus England.  Copyright

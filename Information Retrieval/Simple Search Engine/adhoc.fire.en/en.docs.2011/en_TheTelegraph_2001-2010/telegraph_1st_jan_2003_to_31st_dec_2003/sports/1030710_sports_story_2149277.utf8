The Telegraph - Calcutta
 IFA to increase winners purse 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The IFA is set to increase the winners purse for exhibition matches from this season. The decision was taken following a very good crowd response in Saturdays derby clash. The gate proceeds for the match has been a staggering Rs 12 lakh, prompting us to think on these lines, a top official told The Telegraph. The winners purse would go up from Rs 1,200 to something around Rs 25,000 if the proposal is ratified by the finance committee. Meanwhile, the association plans to introduce dope tests, from the IFA Shield. We may have dope tests in the second phase of the Calcutta League itself, the official informed. Since the dope test facilities will start from the Federation Cup, we want to make use of it even during the local tournaments, he said. IFA secretary Subrata Dutta met the referees and it was decided they would come under a new insurance scheme. Also, a gymnasium will be set up at the Calcutta Referees Association (CRA) tent. The IFA has forwarded a CRA letter  stating they felt insulted that no referees from Bengal have been assigned any match in the Federation Cup  to the AIFF.  Copyright

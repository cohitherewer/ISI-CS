The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bengal aim to end on a high 
 Shib Shankar Paul will spearhead Bengal attack Ahmedabad: Having squandered a golden chance to gain a semi-final berth after a disgraceful defeat against Karnataka, hosts Gujarat face a daunting task to humble Bengal, in what is seen as a do-or-die battle for both teams in the Elite group B Ranji Trophy match beginning at Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera here On Thursday. With their confidence levels plummeting considerably after nightmarish batting displays on their home ground this season, Gujarat pin their hopes solely on speedsters, who have saved their team some blushes with a consistent performance. Our inconsistent batting has let us down in all matches and we lost a real golden chance to reach the semis. We have talked about this (batting debacle) with all players... Shown them their statistics... Where they went wrong in shot selection, Gujarat coach Vijay Patel said. The batsmen have to come up with a score of 300 plus against Bengal. We have to play some positive cricket to end the Ranji season on a victorious note, Patel added. The absence of speedster Siddharth Trivedi, playing for India A in the triangular series, would not dent the bowling attack as Lalit Patel, Shyamal Bhatt and Hitesh Majbudar have troubled opponents batting on several occasions. Bengal are all keyed up to finish their Ranji Trophy engagements on a high after a convincing inning victory against Hyderabad in their previous game in Calcutta. We will definitely miss them (Rohan Gavaskar and Deep Dasgupta) in this must-win game... But we will fight it out to our might tomorrow, said Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri after nets. Bengal, incidentally, have seven points. Our batting did not click when we wanted it to. Scores of about 250 are not match-winning, Ghavri said. Shib Shankar Paul, who has had a dream season grabbing 33 wickets in five matches will spearhead Bengals attack. Ghavri said Bengal will bat first if they win the toss.

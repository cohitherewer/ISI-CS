 Mickelson 1 clear, Woods struggles 
 Tiger Woods tees off on the 10th during Round I of the PGA Championship in Rochester, New York, on Thursday. (Reuters) Rochester: Phil Mickelson forged one clear of the field early in the US PGA Championship first round on Thursday with Tiger Woods struggling to two over par after 13 holes. Australias Rod Pampling was alone in second place, having reeled off four birdies for a blemish-free 66 on his US PGA Championship debut at the par-70 course. American Robert Gamez (13) was a further two shots back at two under, with US Masters champion Mike Weir and US Open champion Jim Furyk (13) among a group of five at one under. World No. 1 Woods birdied the 13th to get to one under but then dropped shots on 14 and 15. Although the 27-year-old American parred the next five holes, he bogeyed the 214-yard third to slip back to two over with five to play.  Hole in one Australias Robert Allenby aced the 226-yard 11th hole with a four iron. It was the first ace at a US PGA Championship since 2001, when Nick Faldo, Scott Hoch and eventual winner David Toms all achieved holes-in-one at Atlanta Athletic Club.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

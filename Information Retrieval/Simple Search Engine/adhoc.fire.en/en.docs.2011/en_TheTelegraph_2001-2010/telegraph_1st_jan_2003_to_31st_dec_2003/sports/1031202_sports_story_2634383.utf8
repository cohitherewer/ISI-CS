 Reincarnation of coach Luxemburgo
 On Sunday, Luxemburgo guided Cruzeiro to their first Brazilian championship Rio de Janeiro: Three years ago, the career of Brazilian coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was in ruins. Having been sacked by Brazil amid allegations that he had taken commissions on the sale of players, Luxemburgo became one of the central figures in a congressional investigation into Brazilian football. The man who had been heralded as the finest coach of his generation was grilled in a public hearing by congressional investigators, who probed his financial wheelings and dealings in a session broadcast live on cable television. Afterwards, a clearly shaken Luxemburgo was told his income was incompatible with his profession, his explanations about the sources of his income were unsatisfactory and that he had failed to declare part of his fortune to tax authorities. But on Sunday, all that was forgotten as Luxemburgo led Cruzeiro to their first Brazilian championship title  and the fourth of his coaching career following triumphs with Palmeiras (1993, 1994) and Corinthians (1998). Once again, the pundits were talking about the attributes of Luxemburgo the football coach rather than the frailties of Luxemburgo the man. The man, who stands out by wearing designer suits and expensive jewellery on the touchline, has not only been quizzed over his income. He was also in trouble after admitting to federal police that he had used a false birth certificate throughout his career, cutting three years off his age. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand suffers second shock
 Anands loss was astonishing Dortmund, Aug. 2 (PTI): Viswanathan Anand suffered his second successive defeat as he went down to Grandmaster Victor Bologan of Moldova in the third round of the Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting here. The venue, where he finished last in 2001, is turning out to be a nightmare for the Indian legend yet again. Having lost 16-year-old Teimour to Radjabov of Azerbaijan in the previous round, the World Cup champions form was wanting yet again. he eventually paved the way for Bologan to emerge sole leader on 2.5 points with one game still in progress. Grandmaster Peter Leko of Hungary drew his third game on the trot after Radjabov decided not to go for complications despite the advantage of playing white. The Baku-boy was obviously pleased with his extraordinary victory over Anand and played it safe against the Queens Indian defence employed by the Hungarian. Anand had a fantastic performance against Bologan when they met last during the 2000 World Championship in New Delhi. Then, Anand had beaten Bologan with white and had cruised through to the next round. Naturally the Moldovan was keen to get the revenge. Bologans victory was astonishing for the way it came. Anand opened with the Caro Kann, had himself in trouble in the middle game, missed out on a tactic that cost him a pawn, lost another pawn and it was all over in 41 moves. Anand has a plus 3 score against me and I am naturally happy to pull one back, said bologan after the game, adding that probably anand made too many queen sorties and also his attack was faster on the king.

 Hurley gets maiden WI call-up 
St Johns: Allrounder Ryan Hurley has earned his first international call-up to the West Indies squad for this months one-day series against Australia. Joining him in the 15-member squad will be Devon Smith, David Bernard and Omari Banks, all of whom made international debuts during the current Test series against Australia and are being given their first chance at the one-day level. The seven-match series begins in Jamaica on May 17. Hurley enjoyed a prolific 2003 regional series for champions Barbados. The 27-year-old off-spinner scored 337 runs and took 18 wickets in nine matches. Opening batsman Smith and allrounder Bernard are 21. Banks is 20. Captain Brian Lara has said his players, the youngest ever fielded by the West Indies with an average age just under 25, have been batting well but need to improve their bowling. THE XV Brian Lara (captain), Ramnaresh Sarwan (vice-captain), Omari Banks, Ricardo Powell, David Bernard, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Corey Collymore, Mervyn Dillon, Vasbert Drakes, Chris Gayle, Ryan Hurley, Ridley Jacobs, Jermaine Lawson, Marlon Samuels, Devon Smith.

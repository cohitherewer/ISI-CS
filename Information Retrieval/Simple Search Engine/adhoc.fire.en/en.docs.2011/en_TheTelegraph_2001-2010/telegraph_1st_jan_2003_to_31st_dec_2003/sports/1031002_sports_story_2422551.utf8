 DNA tests on anvil 
London: Detectives investigating football gangrape claims were reported to be set to request DNA samples from the accused soccer stars on Wednesday. The move came as the 17-year-old girl has shown family members bruises she says were inflicted in the attack at the Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane. She claims she was willingly having sex with one of the players when seven others walked in. She claims that they then raped her. A police source described the girls story as credible. Many items, including sheets, towels, drinking glasses and refuse, were removed from the room for forensic testing. It is believed the Premiership player who booked the room has proved he did not stay there and is denying any involvement.  (AFP)  Copyright

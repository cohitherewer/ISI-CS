The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Japan book semis berth
Bangkok: Japan booked a place in the semi-finals of the AFC womens championship after scoring five second-half goals to beat Chinese Taipei 5-0 in their group B match on Sunday. For a while, Taipeis tactics of preventing Japan from playing through the middle worked, but in the second half, Japan scored the five goals within 23 minutes. The goals came via Homare Sawa (62th, 85th), Yayoi Kobayashi (72th), Karina Maruyama (74th) and an own-goal credited to Taipeis goalkeeper. Myanmar recorded their second victory of the meet by beating Guam 4-0 on Sunday to share second spot in group B with Taipei on six points each. Guam and The Philippines are at the bottom with no points.  (AP)  Copyright

 Nalbandians family under kidnap threat
 Buenos Aires: Tennis star David Nalbandian  is the latest sports personality from Argentina to fall  victim to potential rackets with police keeping a close  watch on his family in case of an attempted kidnap. Police in the central province of Cordoba confirmed on Monday they are keeping the players parents under close surveillance after receiving a threat that they would be kidnapped. Weve taken this preventative step after receiving threats saying the family of Nalbandian could be targeted by kidnappers, police chief Pablo Nieto told local radio station Cadena 3. Nieto added that the threat included the date of the intended kidnap attempt. Nalbandians father affirmed the police presence but said he was trying to live as normal a family life as possible. The kidnapping of sports personalities or of their close family members has become commonplace in Argentina in recent years. (AFP)  Copyright

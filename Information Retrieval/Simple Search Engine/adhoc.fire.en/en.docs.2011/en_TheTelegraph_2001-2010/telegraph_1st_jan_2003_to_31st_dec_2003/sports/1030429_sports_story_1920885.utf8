 Case against Wasim Akram 
 wrong side of the law: Wasim Akram, caught off-guard over a gifted jeep Karachi: Pakistani police said on Monday they had registered a criminal case against leading cricketer Wasim Akram after he was accused of failing to pay for a jeep he had purchased from a former friend. Police registered a case against the fast bowler after a complaint from his estranged friend Saadat Hayat, police inspector Hanif Qadri said. Qadri said Wasim had been accused of taking the jeep on the pretext of purchasing it, but had not paid for it. Wasims wife Huma denied the allegation and said the jeep was given as a gift. There is no cheating involved, she said by telephone from Lahore. This happened three years ago. We wanted to return the vehicle a long time ago, but he refused to take it back and instead demanded an exorbitant sum against it. Wasim is in England playing for Hampshire. Police said the case was registered under Section 406, that deals with misappropriation and breach of trust. Anyone found guilty under this law could face up to three years in prison. Contracts likely for Pak players Meanwhile, Pakistan plan to introduce central contracts for up to 35 cricketers. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Lt General Tauqir Zia said Monday the system would provide players with financial security. The idea is to pick the best available talent, including those already playing and those who are borderline cases, and give them a monthly retainership, he said. Under the present system players are paid by series or by tour. Last year the PCB introduced win bonuses while cutting player earnings when the team lost. (Reuters)  Copyright

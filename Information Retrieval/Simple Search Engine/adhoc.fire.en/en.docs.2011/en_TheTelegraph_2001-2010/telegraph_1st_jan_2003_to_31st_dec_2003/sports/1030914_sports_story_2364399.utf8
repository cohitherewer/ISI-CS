 4-month ban on Lokuarachchi 
Colombo, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Sri Lankan cricketer Kaushal Lokuarachchi has been banned for four months, with a two-year suspended sentence, after his involvement in a fatal car crash last month, a Sri Lanka cricket board official said on Saturday. Leg-spinner Lokuarachchi was arrested after the August 16 accident, in which a woman was killed after a car crashed through a Colombo bus stand into a roadside house. The BCCSL has warned Lokuarachchi for misconduct and imposed a four-month ban from all cricket from the date of the incident, as well as a suspended two-year ban, BCCSL secretary Mohan de Silva said.

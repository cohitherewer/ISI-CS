The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Brazil soar high above the Eagles
 Brazilian striker Luis Fabiano celebrates his goal against Nigeria in Abuja Wednesday. Brazil won 3-0. (Reuters) Abuja (Nigeria): World champions Brazil defeated Nigeria 3-0 in an international friendly match here Wednesday night, ahead of the defence of their Confederation Cup crown later this month. Brazils goals were scored by debutants Gil and Luis Fabiano in the first half and Parma striker Adriano late on in the second period. Despite their defeat, Nigeria drew praise from Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parriera. Nigeria should not be ashamed that they lost to the world champions, he said. We have worked hard and long to be where we are today. His Nigerian counterpart, Christian Chukwu, said he was still building a new team and should be given a chance to continue with the work he has started. It was not a bad match for us because we are still trying to build a new team. We paid dearly by losing concentration and not capitalising on the chances we got in front of goal. The lively Gil, from Corinthians, never looked like a player only winning his first cap and his industry was fittingly rewarded after 33 minutes when he drove through the otherwise solid Nigerian defence from the left flank before smashing past an onrushing goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. Fellow debutant Fabiano, leading scorer in the Brazilian championship, headed the world champions further ahead four minutes later after he nodded home off a cross by Billeti from the right flank. The South Americans then put the game beyond Nigeria with 10 minutes left when Parma forward Adriano stabbed home another cross past Enyeama. A disappointed home crowd, many of whom were denied the chance to watch the match from kick-off because of poor crowd control by the stadium officials, then showed their displeasure by throwing stones and other missiles on to the pitch.

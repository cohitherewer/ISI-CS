 Lele counters BCA charges
Vadodara: Former BCCI secretary Jayawant Lele on Sunday accused the Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) officials of hatching a conspiracy to malign his image and dismissed their decision to expel him from the state body as unconstitutional. Lele was expelled from BCA for life on Saturday with two other former office bearers, on charges of alleged financial irregularities and administrative lapses. Denying the charges, Lele said: When the election of the present BCA office bearers is challenged in the Gujarat High Court, how could this body expel me for life? Lele had challenged the BCA elections held in September 2001, terming the entire process as illegal. It is an unconstitutional body and ever since it assumed office, it has been taking unconstitutional decisions and behaving in a manner suiting their requirements. If they were so sure of their action, why did they take more than one week to announce their decision to expel us? The committee had taken the decision on July 23. The reason behind it was that they knew I will reply to the charges levelled against me and make their position awkward. The case is to be heard in the High Court on Monday. The expulsion of Lele, former joint secretary Pradeep Desai and former treasurer Ramesh Dalvi, was announced by the BCA secretaries Kiran More and Samarjeet Gaikwad on Saturday.  (PTI)  Copyright

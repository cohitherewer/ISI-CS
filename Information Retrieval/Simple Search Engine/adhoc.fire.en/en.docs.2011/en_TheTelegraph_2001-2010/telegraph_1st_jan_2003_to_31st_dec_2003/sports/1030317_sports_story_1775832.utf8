The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hope the Indians wont bully us
 - Sandeep Patil declines Kenyan offer  to continue as coach FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sandeep Patil with  his Kenyan wards after the win over Zimbabwe which sealed  their semis berth  Durban: I know India will  come hard at us, but I hope we wont be bullied, was outgoing  Kenyan coach Sandeep Patils initial response to a query  on how he was preparing for Thursdays semi-final No.2 of  the World Cup. Talking to The Telegraph at  the Holiday Inn Elangeni, Sunday afternoon, Patil added:  Knowing Sachin Tendulkar, he will come out guns blazing...  That he didnt get runs in the Super Six game (Cape Town)  is what will get him even more charged-up... So, I hope  Sachin, specially, doesnt bully us. Patil, though, is worried about  injuries to three key players  the in-form Thomas Odoyo  (groin injury), veteran Maurice Odumbe (hamstring problem)  and Kennedy Obuya (struck by Brett Lee). Then, captain Steve  Tikolo is down with a throat infection-induced fever. Things dont look good at this  point but, thankfully, we can wait for three days. Odumbe,  in fact, wasnt fit for the Zimbabwe match but, given its  importance, we played him and the injury got aggravated,  Patil remarked. Patil, a member of Indias 1983  World Cup-winning side and a former India coach, quipped:  Hopefully, I wont have to come out of retirement... If  I have to, Ill probably borrow Sachins bat and Ashish  Nehras trousers! Patil (prematurely) quit international  cricket at the start of the 1986-87 season. Incidentally, Patil declined to  speak at length about Thursday. Its best not to talk too  much before a game because, otherwise, digesting everything  later can become a problem ... But, yes, we should play  good cricket... Personally, Im in a win-win situation:  Very happy if Kenya make it, very happy if India go to the  final. The Super Six match went in Indias  favour by six wickets.  Aasif Karim, who  finished with three for seven from 8.2 overs, including six maidens, in  Kenyas match against Australia in Durban on Saturday.  (Reuters) Patil, meanwhile, has declined  an offer from the Kenyan Cricket Association (KCA) to continue  beyond the World Cup. My mind was made up six months back  and Ill be returning to India once the tournament is over.  The KCA has been very nice and I wish Kenyan cricket well.  However, for family reasons, its not possible to stay on,  he said. [That Patil would return to his  roots was first reported in these columns earlier this month.] Boost to self-belief Aasif Karim, MoM in the game versus  Australia, feels the teams self-belief has got a boost.  While we did lose by five wickets, the world champions  were struggling at 100-odd for five... Also, despite our  early setbacks, we played out the 50 overs, Karim, a double  international (he is also a Davis Cupper), pointed out. Captain in the 1999 World Cup,  Karim was pulled out of retirement on the eve of this edition   a decision the coach and selectors havent regretted.  Significantly, Saturdays MoM award was the left-arm spinners  first. Actually, Karim (39) is quite  an allrounder: He publishes Kenyas only sports magazine,  too. Copyright

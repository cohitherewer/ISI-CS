 Arjun Singh, Randhawa lead
Srinagar: Asias No. 1 Jyoti Randhawa was off to a flying start in the Indian PGA Tour, sharing the top spot with Arjun Singh at the Rs 18-lakh season-opening Kashmir Open golf championship after the first round on Wednesday. Randhawa carded a five-under 67, the same as Arjun to lead a quality field. Chandigarhs Ranjit Singh and Delhis Pappan were the surprise pair at tied third, one stroke better than Mukesh Kumar, champion for the past four years, and Uttam Singh Mundy. Defending champion Digvijay Singh was at tied seventh with Firoz Ali of Calcutta. (PTI)  Copyright

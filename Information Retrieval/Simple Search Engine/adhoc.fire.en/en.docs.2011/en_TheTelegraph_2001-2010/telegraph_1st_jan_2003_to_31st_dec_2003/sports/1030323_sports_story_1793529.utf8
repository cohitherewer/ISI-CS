The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Come what may, life wont change 
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  A tale of two shirts: Sourav Ganguly changed his shirt after the disastrous defeat to Australia For Sourav Ganguly, the moment of truth is at hand. Only the second captain (after Kapil Dev) to lead India to a World Cup final, the pressure is enormous. Yet, Sourav  who spoke to The Telegraph at the Sandton Sun amp; Towers Intercontinental Saturday morning  isnt getting overwhelmed by the occasion. Excerpts: Q. Emotionally, how are you placed just hours away from your biggest day? A. Im fine... As Im captain, Sunday will be more special... Having said that, this isnt the time to get overwhelmed by emotions. Weve done very well to get thus far. Now, weve got to do better and win the World Cup. Surely, your mental preparation must be a little different? I wouldnt say so... Ive been keeping myself calm... Have been trying not to get too worked up. After all, if that does happen, then the risk of erring with the basics is high. Fair enough, but what about your teams (mental) preparation?  The boys are keeping it simple... In fact, our last team meeting will be pretty routine as I dont wish to add to the obvious pressure by proposing anything new. Of course, we will be looking back on the eight wins (in succession) and drawing inspiration. Arent the bigger games approached differently?  But the pressure element remains the same... The good thing is weve reached the finals of the last two mini World Cups (Nairobi and Colombo) and, so, the boys are on familiar terrain. How do you handle pressure?  By focussing on what I need to do as captain and batsman... Captaining India isnt an easy job and, if anything, can get tougher if routine pressure cant be handled. Looking back, on the past six weeks, has there been one turning point for Team India?  (After a pause) Overall, weve played outstanding cricket... However, if Ive got to pick one, it would probably be Nehras spell against England. We needed to win that match (in Durban) and he ripped England apart (six for 23). That victory put us on a high and, in the very next game, we thrashed Pakistan.  But, there have been other fine performances....  (Interrupting) Each one of us has put in that extra bit... Each one of us has shown the hunger to win the biggest prize in cricket... I salute everybody.  Frankly, how much of a chance did you give yourself after the horror show in New Zealand?  Knowing that conditions (in South Africa) would be very different, I was hopeful. I knew New Zealand wouldnt be repeated, that the changed conditions would set right many of the ills.  Post New Zealand, you must have worked on your batting as well?  I didnt lose faith in my own ability, didnt stop backing myself. Having played for seven years, I knew I would come out of the rough patch. (Adds after pausing) At this level, if you dont back yourself, you are finished. Indeed, the higher you go, more the pressure. So, youve got to keep backing yourself.  What gives you the strength when the going isnt smooth?  Self-belief, confidence... The family and God... I know God wont be unkind and I keep reminding myself that if I could deliver in the past, I can deliver in the present as well. Have the past six weeks taught you something?  To never give up... To never take anything for granted... Had I and the team given up after the defeat in Centurion (Australia), we wouldnt now have been in Johannesburg.  Will the No.24 on your shirt stay for good?  (Laughs) For now, yes... As Ive told you, Ive been wearing that at a friends suggestion and the change (from 99) has already brought me three centuries.  Getting Sachin Tendulkar to make that we-wont-give-up promise, in Harare, was quite extraordinary...  Well, Sachin spoke because he is the biggest name around... We didnt want a repeat of the incidents which affected Rahul and Kaif...  The last question: Will life change Sunday evening onwards? It wont... I wish we can take the World Cup but, come what may, life wont change.  Copyright

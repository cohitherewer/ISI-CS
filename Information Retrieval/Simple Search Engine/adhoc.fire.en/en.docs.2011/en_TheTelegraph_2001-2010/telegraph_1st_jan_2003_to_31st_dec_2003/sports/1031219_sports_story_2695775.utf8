The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ look for winning formula
 - First test vs Paistan
 Richardson is full of optimism Hamilton: Never has winning the toss been more vital than it will be for the first Test between New Zealand and Pakistan starting here on Friday with the bowlers on both sides desperate to have first crack on the expected green-top wicket. Persistent rain in recent weeks hindered the hopes of ground staff to prepare an ideal pitch, and despite cloudless skies this week the strip still holds a green tinge and the prospect of early fireworks. Pakistan have arguably one of the best bowling attacks in Test cricket today with Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami, and likely backup from the lanky Shabbir Ahmed and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, a point acknowledged by the Black Caps. This is as good a bowling line-up as there is in world cricket at the moment, said New Zealand opener Mark Richardson, who faces the daunting task of maintaining or improving his Test average of 49.4. Im trying to get my head around how hard its going to be to succeed. Akhtar has 107 wickets from 28 Tests at 25.1, Sami 26 wickets from 10 Tests at a surprising 44.2, Ahmed 23 from four at 21.1 and Kaneria 62 from 14 at 26.1. But while acknowledging the lethal strike power that faces them, New Zealand are not conceding favouritism, sensing if anything the conditions are better suited to the home bowlers. To match their bowling power, Pakistan boast an fine batting line-up, including the exciting young pair of Taufeeq Umar and Imran Farhat, but history suggests they will struggle more than New Zealand on the bowlers track at Westpac Park. I give ourselves a very, very good chance of bowling them out cheaply with our bowling attack, said Richardson, who scored a century against Pakistan here four years ago. I cant see us dominating their bowling attack, but as long as we can just get enough runs to keep our noses in front we can win it. Two years ago, Pakistan were skittled for 104 and 118 on the same ground and lost the Test by an innings and 185 runs. Bounce is crucial for these guys, because in Pakistan the ball doesnt bounce above knee height, batsman Craig McMillan said. Weve got big tall guys like (Jacob) Oram and (Chris) Cairns who get that extra bounce. If we get that we can put them under some pressure. History backs the Black Caps in Hamilton where they have won five of 11 Tests, including four of the last five, and suffered just two losses  to Australia in 2000 and the Pakistan in 1993-94, thanks to fiery Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, however, is hoping his team can carry on where they left off in the recent 5-0 one-day series whitewash of New Zealand. We are confident but we are also very aware that New Zealand were missing a number of their best players (in the one-day series in Pakistan earlier this month), Inzamam said on Thursday.. Coach Javed Miandad would give no hints on the Pakistan team but Shoaib Malik could take the spinners berth from Kaneria. New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, who had to fly home with an abdominal strain during thier tour of India, said he was relieved to be back in the side. Fleming came through with flying colours when he turned out for Wellington in a recent State Championship match. I felt absolutely fine during the match and have felt nothing since, so continuing to play did the trick, Fleming said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

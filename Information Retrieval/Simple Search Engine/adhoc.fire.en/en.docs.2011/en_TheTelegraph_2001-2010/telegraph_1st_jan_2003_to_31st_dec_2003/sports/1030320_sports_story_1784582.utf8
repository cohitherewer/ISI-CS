The Telegraph - Calcutta
Bengal  Ata-ur ban lifted 
Islamabad: The PCB has lifted the life ban imposed on paceman Ata-ur Rahman in connection with match-fixing allegations after an official inquiry cleared charges against him. The PCB is also likely to lift strictures on Wasim Akram, after the World Cup final. Rahman was banned from international cricket and fined Rs 1 lakh in 2000 after a judicial commission headed by then high court judge Justice Malik Qayyum found him guilty of perjury. While Rahman and Salim Malik were banned for life, the PCB imposed severe strictures against Akram and some other cricketers.  Copyright

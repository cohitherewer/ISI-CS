		 Thursday, January 02, 2003 				 Lack of form worries Sourav
																								Christchurch: Sourav Gangulys poor run with the bat has finally started causing concern to the Indian skipper as he admitted Wednesday he will have to try and regain it in the remainder of the seven-match series against New Zealand.																								Yes, I am concerned about my own form, I have had a pretty good year, but its just not happened in New Zealand. We still have four more games to go, and I will keep trying, Sourav said after India lost their third successive one-dayer.																								Sourav has managed just 18 runs in the three ODIs played so far. 																								The batsmen have to find a way out. They have been successful on pitches similar to these and they should work their way out, Sourav said. But I guess the best approach is what Astle adopted to play on these wickets.																								A reference to the pitch drew a terse remark from the Indian skipper. Everyone has watched the match and should form their own judgement about the conditions. I would not like to get into the details. 																								But Sourav did not rule out a chance of revival in the series. Nothing is impossible. It is still an open series. It is a tough road ahead of us but we will try our best.																								New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming had special praise for Tuffey. He is starting very well for the others to follow, the captain said.  (PTI)

 Lee Lagan stops Geet Sethi in final
Hyderabad: Geet Sethis dream of capturing the crown for the eighth time was shattered on Sunday as he lost 5-6 to Englands Lee Lagan in the final of the IBSF world billiards championship. The young Englishman kept his cool in the see-saw battle to win his maiden world title. He prevailed 65-151, 21-152, 150-16, 151-59, 150-142, 152-12, 149-150, 151-21, 86-150, 62-150, 150-32. Sethi, who was runners-up in the last edition of the meet too, made an impressive start and took the first two frames with breaks of 89 and 123. A silly mistake in the third by the Indian gave Lagan a chance to get back into the match and he grabbed it splendidly with an unfinished break of 147. The Englishman then went on to win the next two frames, the last with an unfinished 150 break after Sethi had notched up a break of 137 to go into the break with a 3-2 lead. In the post lunch session, Lagan looked like racing away with the tie as he recorded a 73-point break to take a 4-2 lead. But Sethi soon found his composure and took advantage of a slip by his rival who needed just one point to wrap off the frame. But Lagan won the next frame relatively easily to take a 5-3 lead. As the tension reached its peak, the Indian started coming back to his elements and took the ninth and tenth frames to take the tie into the decider.  (PTI)  Copyright

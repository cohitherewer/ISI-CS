The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harbhajan doubtful in crunch tie 
 - India contemplate fielding extra bowler at Kaifs expense  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 		 Harbhajan has severe  chest infectionBangalore: Not only in the context of the TVS Cup, but for what lies ahead in 2003-2004, its essential that Team India makes a statement at the Chinnaswamy on Wednesday. The Gwalior win, after all, is distant history and the sequence of defeats  Mumbai and Cuttack  must end. With even Ricky Ponting acknowledging that Sourav Gangulys return will alter the home sides body language, the captains comeback (after two surgeries) couldnt have been a game later. Of course, a loss wont end Indias push for a berth in the November 18 final, but too much will hinge on the November 15 clash with New Zealand. As Sourav put it, aim for maximum points both against the world champions and the Black Caps. The impact of the past is to be seen, yes, but its a fact that India have won all three previous ODIs here versus Australia. The Australian captain, though, isnt going to talk about it. Oh, I wasnt aware of such a record... In any case, I wont be talking about it to my boys... Actually, how we play tomorrow will matter, not how we did two-and-half years ago or whenever, Ponting maintained. Aware of the stiff ask, Sourav felt an allround improvement from the earlier matches should make a difference: Basically, we must play in the manner we did for about a year (beginning with the 2001-2002 ODIs in the West Indies)... That, after all, brought us much success... He continued: Personally, Ill be looking to get into groove... Ive had a forced break and, now, its time to make up for lost time... Incidentally, asked whether Australia would be under some pressure, given that the regular India captain was back, Ponting quipped: The pressure will be on him... Hes making a comeback... With so much at stake, coach John Wright was set to field the best XI for the first time in the competition. However, Harbhajan Singhs illness has put the proverbial spanner in the works. He is down with a severe chest infection and, unless theres a miraculous recovery, wont take the field. Harbhajan did go to the Chinnaswamy with the team, for the workout, but quickly returned to the hotel. Tabiyet dhili hai... Theek nahin lag raha... Agar accha improvement nahin hua to khelna ekdum mushkil hai, he said, speaking exclusively, late on Tuesday. It seems Murali Kartik is going to be the beneficiary. Till this development, he was to get the axe to facilitate Anil Kumbles return. Kumble didnt play the last game, against New Zealand (Cuttack), owing to his fathers demise. According to The Telegraphs sources, the Indians are contemplating fielding an extra bowler at the expense of Mohammed Kaif. Nothing has been finalised, but should there be a batsman less, then Ajit Agarkar will keep his place. Or else, the new ball will be given to Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra, making a comeback after almost eight months. At the moment, our attack has become predictable... An extra bowler may just make some difference, one of the sources pointed out. The batsmen, though, havent really been firing. So will Sourav gamble and opt for six-five as opposed to the conventional seven-four? The Australians will definitely bring back the hottest opening pair (Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden). Brad Williams could also feature in the XI. Indications are that only Jimmy Maher and Michael Kasprowicz, both of whom played in Guwahati, are out of the picture. By Pontings own admission, his side hasnt been playing at hundred per cent: Weve played well in patches... Responding to the challenges ahead rests entirely in our hands... However, one cant predict anything... Perhaps, he is bracing for an Indian blitz. Significantly, the Australian captain emphasised there was no drop in motivation given that his team is already in the final. He added: Its never difficult keeping this side motivated... Thats the beauty of this team... Well... With the dew not expected to be a factor, the captain winning the toss is sure to set a target. Thats to be desired in day-night matches in these parts, opined Ponting. As for Sourav, he usually prefers runs on the board. One exception was the World Cup final but, then, everybody learns. TEAMS India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S.Laxman, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Anil Kumble, Murali Kartik, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra. Note: Ajit Agarkar will retain his place, with Kaif going out, if five bowlers are picked. Australia (from): Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting, Damien Martyn, Andrew Symonds, Michael Bevan, Michael Clarke, Ian Harvey, Andy Bichel, Brad Hogg, Brad Williams and Nathan Bracken. Umpires: Neil Mallendar (Eng), A.V. Jayaprakash (Ind). TV umpire: K. Hariharan (Ind).  Copyright

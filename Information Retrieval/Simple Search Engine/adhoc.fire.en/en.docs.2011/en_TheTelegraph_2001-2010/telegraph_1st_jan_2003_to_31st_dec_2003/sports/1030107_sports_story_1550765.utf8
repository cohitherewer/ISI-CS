																								Wellington: New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond will play against India in the fifth one-day International in Wellington on Wednesday after coming through a provincial match untroubled by a side strain, the teams selectors said on Monday.																								Bond played for Canterbury against Wellington in a one-day match on Sunday.																								However, chief selectors Richard Hadlee said out-of-form batsman Craig McMillan was not included and instead would play for his province in domestic one-day and four-day matches.																								McMillan has scored just 62 runs at an average of 8.85 against India in both Test matches and the four previous one-dayers.																								The 26-year-old will play for Canterbury against Central Districts in a one-day match on Tuesday and in a four-day match starting on January 9.																								Allrounder Chris Cairns, who has undergone two knee surgeries in recent months, also played for Canterbury in the same game as Bond and scored 25 but did not bowl.																								Hadlee said Cairns would play alongside McMillan on Tuesday with a view to drafting him into the New Zealand side for the sixth one-day International in Auckland next Saturday. (REUTERS)

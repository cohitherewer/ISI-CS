				 																																	London: Formula One driver Eddie Irvine looks set to retire from the sport after talks with the Jordan Grand Prix team broke down, a British newspaper reported on Thursday.				 																																	Its a sad day. I have decided not to drive in Formula One this year  or at least the moment, Irvine told The Sun newspaper from his home in Miami.				 																																	Championship runner-up with Ferrari in the 1999 season, Irvine was released by Jaguar at the end of his contract in October but had hoped to secure a drive with Jordan for this year. 				 																																	The 37-year-old was looking for a return to the Irish team where he stated his career in 1993. In July last year I made my mind up to drive for Jordan. I had very strong feelings about returning to the team but due to the economic downturn, Jordan are forced to look for a driver who brings extra funds to the team whilst I can only bring speed reliability and greater experience, he said.				 																																	Irvine would have been a strong asset to the struggling team but despite offering to take a huge cut in the  6 million salary Jaguar Racing paid him each year, an agreement could not be reached. 				 																																	London: Sprint hurdler Colin Jackson will become the most capped British male athlete in history after being named in the team on Thursday for an international indoor meeting in Glasgow on February 2. The world record holder will represent his country for the 70th time, overtaking the mark set by pole-vaulter Mike Bull between 1965 and 1977.				 																																	Jackson, who will be 36 next month, set the 110 metre hurdles world record with a time of 12.91 seconds in Stuttgart in 1993 on way to winning the world championship. 				 																																	Berlin: VfL Wolfsburg midfielder Stefan Effenberg said on Thursday that he planned to play at least one more season and perhaps two  because his children gave him the green light to continue. Effenberg, 34, who led Bayern Munich to the Champions League title in 2001, told Bild newspaper his immediate aim was to help Wolfsburg secure a spot in the Uefa Cup next season and that he expected Bayern Munich to win the Bundesliga this season.				 																																	Effenberg, who had earlier talked about retiring soon, also said he believed Borussia Dortmund were his favourites to win the Champions League this season.				 																																	New Orleans: Michael Jordan became the third-leading scorer in the history of the NBA on Wednesday in a game against the New Orleans Hornets. Jordan hit a fallaway jump shot with a minute to play in the first half to pass Wilt Chamberlain for third place on the career scoring list. 				 																																	The basket put Jordans career-scoring total at 31,420 points, which he has amassed in 1,032 regular season games.				 																																	Playing in what he says will be his final season, it appears that Jordan will end his career in third place. He still trails Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz, who had 35,464 points heading into his game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday.				 																																	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the all-time leader with 38,387 career points. 				 																																	 Huelva: Atletico Madrid defender Carlos Aguilera needed emergency treatment both on the pitch and in hospital after losing consciousness during his sides Kings Cup match away to Recreativo Huelva on Wednesday.				 																																	The 33-year-old Aguilera, a former Spanish international, was left motionless after being struck in the face by the ball late on in the game.				 																																	n Tennis: Australian Open live from 9.30 am on STAR Sports n Soccer: Premier League from 10 am on ESPN n Tennis: Australian Open highlights from 6 pm on STAR Sports nCricket, Team India programming, India Glorious from 8 pm on STAR Sports

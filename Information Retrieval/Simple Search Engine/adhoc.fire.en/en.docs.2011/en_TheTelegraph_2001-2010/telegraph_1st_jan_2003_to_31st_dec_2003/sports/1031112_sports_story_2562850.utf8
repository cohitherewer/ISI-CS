The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I play to win every game 
 - Theres excitement, yes, but also some nervousness: Sourav Ganguly  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav says its never easy returning from a lay-off  Bangalore: Theres excitement,  yes, but also some nervousness... After all, Ive been off  cricket for a month, remarked Team India captain Sourav  Ganguly, for whom Wednesdays game versus Australia will  be his first in the current tri-series.  Speaking to The Telegraph  at The Taj West End poolside, before an afternoon workout  at the Chinnaswamy, on match-eve, he added: Actually, after  being operated upon for the second time (owing to an abscess  on the left thigh), I feared I would be away from the game  for two months... That had been the initial assessment of  one of my doctors... Thankfully... Surgery No. 1 was in Mohali on October 14, while the next was in Calcutta less than five days later. In fact, the second operation made Sourav spend nine days at Belle Vue. Only once before  in late 1996  did he have such a lengthy fitness-related lay-off. Of course, its never easy making a return after a lay-off, more so having undergone surgeries... But, then, I was determined on an early comeback and the rehab worked beautifully, Sourav pointed out. Its another matter that his return coincides with India struggling for a place in the November 18 final. Look, our task is well and truly cut out... I know people have been talking about the (November 15) match against New Zealand being a virtual semi-final, but I play to win every game... Tomorrows match comes first, the one in Hyderabad is later, Sourav said emphatically. In Souravs opinion, New Zealand ought to have put it across Australia both in Pune and Guwahati: Poor catching doomed the Black Caps in Pune, while Michael Bevan (84 not out off 97 deliveries) was brilliant in Guwahati... Its not that the world champions have looked invincible... According to Sourav, Damien Martyns 100 at the Wankhede remains the most outstanding innings from any Australian. That effort helped inflict a crushing 77-run defeat on India. Where the bowlers are concerned, at different times, quite a few proved effective. Having come off a significant break  specifically, missing the Mohali Test and four ODIs  Sourav has been spending time with his players and, before the days workout, visited the computer analyst for an update on the Australians. Its going to be his first game versus the world champions after an eminently forgettable show at the Wanderers, on March 23. I think an interaction was necessary as the team had a different captain for a month... Even otherwise, its not unusual for me to speak to the players... One-on-one or in a group, Sourav explained.  Incidentally, Ricky Ponting and Sourav crossed at  the poolside and greeted each other rather warmly. While  the Australian captain queried about Souravs health,  the latter wanted to know if Pontings wife (Rianne, who  has just got her law degree) had come on tour. She hasnt.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Robin no to Bengal offer
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Former India allrounder Robin Singh has informed the CAB that he will not be available to coach Bengal during the forthcoming Ranji Trophy season. My engagements in Chennai will not permit me to be away from home for three/four months. In such circumstances, I wouldnt be doing justice to the job if I take up the offer, Robin told The Telegraph Monday. Earlier, Woorkeri Raman had also turned down the CAB offer citing a no-clearance from his employers. In fact, Raman had suggested Robins name to the association. Robins unavailability means that the CAB will be hard-pressed to find someone suitable. Among the names being discussed now are Madanlal, Yashpal Sharma and Balwinder Singh Sandhu. No best player The CAB has finally decided not to give the Player of the Year award. The matter was discussed at Saturdays working committee meeting and it was left to the senior selection committee to have the final say. On Monday, the selectors decided that Bengals performance in the Ranji Trophy last season has been disgraceful and no player can lay claim to the award. Bengal had barely managed to hold on to the Elite Division berth. We arent trying to send any wrong signals. Its just that the players should realise that they need to pull up their socks. We hope this will inspire them to perform better during the forthcoming season, national selector Pronab Roy said. Like the past two seasons, the Best Pace Bowler of the Year award will also remain unclaimed. Utpal Chatterjee was declared the Gentleman Cricketer of the Year. In the under-15 category, Rohan Banerjee was adjudged years best. Debabrata Das bagged the award in the under-17 section while the under-19 prize went jointly to Avik Chowdhury and Sourav Sarkar.

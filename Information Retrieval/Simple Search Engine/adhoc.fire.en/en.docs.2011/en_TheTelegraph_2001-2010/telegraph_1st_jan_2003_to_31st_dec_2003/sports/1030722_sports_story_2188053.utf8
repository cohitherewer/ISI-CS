The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3-0 verdict for Tollygunge 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Gouranga Dutta of Tollygunge Agragami takes a shot at goal during their Super Division tie versus Mohammedan AC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Picture be Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami were back to winning ways with a 3-0 victory over Mohammedan AC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. Amit Das put the National League side ahead in the first half while Akeem Abolanle and Gouranga Datta increased the margin in the second session. Tollygunge seemed to have somewhat mended their ways following a goalless tie against Railway FC in their previous game. The midfield showed cohesion and it was reflected in some goalbound moves under the tireless Amit. Akeem was also energetic upfront and Isiaka Awoyemi ensured he had a role to play on the overlaps while keeping the rival forwards at bay. It was a one-way traffic for most of the 90 minutes and Mohammedan AC, despite an impressive line-up comprising a majority of the Big Three-rejects, failed to make much of an impact. Tollygunge took the lead in the 23rd minute. Till then, their dominance was never in doubt, but it was just that things were not falling into place. Mohammedan AC survived a few close shaves and once Akeem up the right beat the defenders in speed before unleashing a rightfooter, which went wide off the target. Goalkeeper Shibram Dey should be held responsible for the goal. He failed to collect Suman Duttas insipid shot, the ball bouncing off his chest to Akeem inside the box. The Nigerian placed it for an onrushing and unmarked Amit to put it beyond the goalkeeper. Shibram almost let in another early in the second session when he missed the flight of the ball, but Isiaka, in his eagerness to take advantage of the fumble, fouled the goalkeeper. The second goal  a result of Akeems solo run  came in the 73rd minute. Receiving the ball inside the rival territory, he moved down the left, got past a couple of defenders and then beat the third on sheer speed. Cutting in to the box, Akeem placed the ball to the left of the goalkeeper. Chance had a big role in the third goal. Substitute Prakash Kolay snatched the ball from a Mohammedan AC defender, paving the path for Gouranga to beat the offside trap and goalkeeper.

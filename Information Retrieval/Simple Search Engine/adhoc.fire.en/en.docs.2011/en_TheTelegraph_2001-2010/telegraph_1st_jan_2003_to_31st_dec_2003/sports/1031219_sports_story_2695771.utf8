The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Miserly Murali in 3-wkt haul
 - FINAL TEST - Flintoffs blazing 77 rescues England from middle-order slump  Tillekeratne Dilshan dives to stop a shot from Marcus Trescothick on the first day of the third and final Test in Colombo on Thursday. (Reuters) Colombo: Muttiah Muralidharan took three wickets for 38 in 37 overs as England reached 259 for eight at the close of the first day of the deciding third and final Test with Sri Lanka on Thursday. On a day of fluctuating fortunes, Englands openers had thundered along after Michael Vaughan won his first toss in six Tests, putting on 78 for the first wicket. Marcus Trescothick blazed his way to 70 but edged the last ball of the morning session to Mahela Jayawardene at slip. The touring side lost four wickets for 31 either side of lunch but with England wobbling on 139 for five, Andrew Flintoff temporarily restored the balance. He raced to an aggressive 77 from 109 balls, hitting 10 fours and four sixes. But Sri Lanka reclaimed the upper hand by the close, taking the wickets of Flintoff, Gareth Batty (14) and Ashley Giles (10) in the final session. Chris Read was unbeaten on 13 at the close, having occupied the crease for 82 minutes, with tailender James Kirtley on one. Flintoff, who had scored only 36 runs in four innings during the series until Thursday, added 87 in 186 balls with Batty for the sixth wicket after Englands mid-innings collapse. Batty, promoted ahead of wicketkwas content to play second fiddle to Flintoff, facing 101 balls in all. Sri Lanka broke through luckily when Batty badly mistimed a pull shot, dragging a long hop from Upul Chandana straight to Maravan Atapattu at mid-wicket.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

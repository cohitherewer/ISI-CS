The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lewis held for drunk driving
 KING IN PERIL: After doping charges, more trouble for Carl Lewis Los Angeles: Nine-time Olympic gold-medallist Carl Lewis was arrested for suspected drunk driving after his sports car crashed in Los Angeles, according to the California highway patrol. The accident occurred early Monday morning on a south Los Angeles freeway. Police said they observed symptoms of alcohol intoxication in the driver identified as Frederick Carl Lewis. Lewis, who was driving a 2004 Maserati, was not injured. The 41-year-old had a glittering track and field career that spanned two decades and included gold medals in the 1984, 1988, 1992 and 1996 Olympics. He is one of three athletes ever to win the gold in a single event (long jump) four times. Lewis allegedly failed a series of field sobriety tests, said the police officer. He was arrested for driving under the influence. Lewis also later posted a blood-alcohol level above 0.08 percent  the states legal limit, the police said. The arrest came after a week of bad publicity for Lewis. Sports Illustrated and the Orange County Register newspaper named him as one of more than 100 United States athletes allowed to enter international competitions after allegedly failing doping tests. The allegations came in documents released by former US Olympic Committee (USOC) anti-doping official, Dr Wade Exum. According to Exums documents, Lewis was one of three eventual gold medallists who tested positive for banned stimulants at the 1988 Olympic trials in Indianapolis. It was claimed Lewis gave three urine samples containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Joe Deloach, who won the 200m, and Andre Phillips, who won the 400m hurdles, in the Seoul Olympics also tested positive for a banned stimulant in 1988. None was prevented from competing after the USOC determined they had ingested the substances inadvertently. Officials on the current USOC dispute claims that results of drug tests were suppressed, and Lewis lawyer Martin Singer said the athlete never took anything with the intent to enhance performance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dubious penalty saves Bagans day
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia being challenged by Mahindra Uniteds Surkumar Singh (No. 2) Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Defending champions Mohun Bagan escaped with a 1-1 draw, thanks to a dubious 89th-minute penalty, in their National Football League (NFL) match against Mahindra United at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. The visitors, too, scored via a penalty. In the 41st minute, an R.P. Singh through found Mongba Aby Samson clear inside the box and Mohun Bagan defender Satish Bharti, out of sheer desperation, pulled him down. Referee P.K. Bose rightly pointed to the dreaded spot and Mahindras Brazilian striker Ednei Jose Damasio converted. He now has six goals from five matches. The angry reaction of Mohun Bagan players looked out of place. Not so the visitors protests following Boses decision to award the home team the late penalty. Basudeb Mondals flag-kick came back to him and the Mohun Bagan playmaker again sent the ball towards the box. Two Mohun Bagan players failed to connect the ball in the air and it crashed into defender Khalid Siddiquis abdomen. But the referee quickly awarded the penalty, turning a deaf ear to the visitors plea. Jose Ramirez Barreto, who played as a withdrawn forward, made no mistake in netting the equaliser. Fridays result pushed Mohun Bagan further behind the title race. They now have 22 points from 14 games  11 points behind leaders East Bengal and nine adrift of second-placed Salgaocar. Bhaichungs comeback  The match marked Bhaichung Bhutias return after an injury-induced lay-off. Replacing Jayanta Sen in the second half, Bhaichung had a reasonably good outing. His sprints, hidden turn and ball-play were evident, but he didnt appear fully fit. He has put on some extra kilos and was slow chasing balls. Bhaichung did set up a great ball for Basudeb minutes before the equaliser, but the latters hastily-taken side-volley went off target. On another occasion, Bhaichung broke free on the right and was stopped by a defender in the Mahindra box. The referee did not pay heed to his appeal for a penalty.

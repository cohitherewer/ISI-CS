 Fifa move harms Brazil: Parreira
Rio de Janeiro: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has said there were signs that manoeuvres had been taking place within the sport to prevent Brazil winning their sixth World Cup. According to media reports, Parreira said the decision of Fifa to allow European clubs the right to refuse to release players for 2004 Olympic qualifiers was clearly aimed at harming Brazils 2006 World Cup hopes. In 1966, European footballers did everything they could to prevent Brazil winning their third world title. Now the situation is being repeated by officials, Parreira said. When authorising European clubs not to release players for Olympic qualifiers, Fifa clearly harmed Brazil and is working in the interests of European clubs. I understand that the clubs pay players wages and they feel hard done. But all clubs must understand that players can be summoned whenever necessary.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chambers can cut ban if he reveals all
 Dwain Chambers can help strengthen the drug-net, feels IAAF London: European 100 m champion Dwain Chambers could see his two-year ban for doping reduced if he comes forward with information on how drugs are propagating in his sport and who is behind them. According to a report in the Sunday Telegraph, citing the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), Chambers could be eligible for a reduced ban in accordance with IAAF rule 60-9. The ruling allows for a reduced sentence if assistance if provided in a doping inquiry. If he (Chambers) did have information and came in and said, Right, I can tell you whats been going on and here are the people involved, then he could help his case, said IAAF spokesman Nick Davies. If he were smart, he would be thinking now, If I could come up with something big then maybe I could be suspended for only a year. A second urine sample, or B test, from Chambers Friday confirmed the presence of designer steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), which was detected in an out-of-competition test taken at a training camp in Saarbrucken, Germany, on August 1. Chambers, who was one of Britains main medals hopes for next years Olympics in Athens, has been suspended from competition by the IAAF and is set to attend a disciplinary hearing by UK Athletics. Chambers is still expected to be handed a ban of two years at an independent disciplinary panel next month. The ban means he will miss the Athens Olympics and, even if he decides to turn witness and benefit from the IAAFs exceptional ruling, it is unlikely that the 25-year-old Englishman could compete at the Olympics again  unless he changes nationality. Under British Olympic Association rules, doping offenders are banned for life from the Olympics Games. Nevertheless, IAAF spokesman Davies affirmed that convincing athletes to whistle-blow is one of the ways they are hoping to rid the sport of doping. He added: What we are aiming for is to get more people out of the sport who are doping, so if he (Chambers) comes to the table and says, This is the person who has been giving it to me and these are the other people who have been involved, then he could help himself. Chambers says that his United States-based coach Remy Korchemny advised him to use controversial California-based nutritionist Victor Conte, whose Balco Laboratories have been accused by the US Anti-Doping Agency of being responsible for producing THG. And it is believed that the IAAF, who are set to introduce tough new laws on the licensing of athletics coaches, are scrutinising the Ukrainian-born coach who has worked closely with four other athletes who have also tested positive. Chambers American training partners Kelli White and Chryste Gaines have tested positive for the mild stimulant modafinil, as has American 400 m runner Calvin Harrison, who also has links with Korchemny.

 Karnataka seize initiative
Bangalore: Some good bowling by Sunil Joshi and Udit Patel helped Karnataka bowl out Kerala for a paltry 190 on the opening day of the five-day Ranji Trophy plate final Tuesday. Joshi took six for 62 and Patel claimed three for 42 before the hosts reached 31 without loss at stumps. Both teams will play in the elite tier next season. Kerala openers Sujith Somasundar and Munzzam Nathani added 58 runs before Joshi started the collapse. BRIEF SCORES Kerala 190 (S. Somasunder 44, C.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 TN battle Assam
 Munaf snared 3 for 45 Chennai: Assam pushed Tamil Nadu to a tight corner before the hosts recovered somewhat to reach 291 for nine in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match on Tuesday. Put in to bat, Tamil Nadu lost their first three wickets with just 85 runs on board. It became 144 for six before Dinesh Karthik and Vidyuth Sivaramakrishnan added 93 precious runs for the seventh wicket. Karthik made 71 (138 balls, 10x4) and Vidyuth contributed 53 (62 balls, 9x4). Three players from Tamil Nadu moved to Assam this season after failing to make it to their state team. One of them, R. Satish, did maximum damage, taking three for 33. Another Tamil Nadu reject, leg-spinner Raghuram, claimed two for 39. In New Delhi, Tejinder Pal Singh took Railways to a position of strength against Punjab. His 168 and his second wicket partnership of 201 with captain Sanjay Bangar helped Railways reach 311 for four. In Mumbai, A deadly combination of pace and spin helped Mumbai bowl out Kerala for a paltry 165 on the opening day of the Elite Group A match. The hosts were 15 for one at stumps. Pacemen Munaf Patel (3/45), Usman Malvi (3/33) and off-spinner Ramesh Powar (3/27) did the damage for Mumbai. Put in to bat on a seaming wicket, the visitors found themselves in all sorts of trouble, losing six wickets for 97. A responsible 48 by Sujith Somasunder was the only redeeming feature for Kerala.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Attitude, that is Anjus USP
 - She has the focus to be among medals in Athens
 Guest Column / P.T.Usha Anju Bobby George sails to glory in  Paris on Saturday. What makes me happy is how Anju  Bobby George mixes humility with fame. Its her attitude;  thats her USP. It makes for a great sportsperson, a great  athlete. I was there, among the cheerleaders  at the Busan Asian Games and saw her gold-winning performance.  And while she was going over the moon in accolades, she  never really gave the impression that it was a goal in itself  that had been reached. It was clear to the eye. Back  home, while a host of medal winners (and there were many  in Busan) busied themselves attending felicitations and  more felicitations, Anju hardly wasted time in getting back  down to the basic business of improving her performance. It was a mind that loves to think  coolly, plan ahead and stick to it. She was just back from  the Busan Games, and if I recall right, her training schedule  had already been done, looking ahead to the Paris world  meet. All this, mind you, ten months ago. It is only this  level of planning, thought and dedication to the cause that  can take you anywhere near your target. And, while this is not to slight  her abilities, having known her well enough, I can say all  her breaks have come at the right time. This includes being  trained by none other than the great Mike Powell. Look,  luck is just a manifestation of all the hard work you have  put in. Also, having started early with  exactly what she is best at, has been a boon. She took to  athletics at school itself, and was particularly lucky that  she attended a college  Trichur Vimala College  where  the athletics coach specialised in jumps. Later, even when  she married, she was fortunate in that her husband was himself  was an athlete and somebody who could appreciate and encourage  her own ambitions.  I think it is important for all  women athletes to have the encouragement first from their  parents and then from both their husband and his family. Having moved to Kunnur from Kottayam  did not affect her training at all. I much congratulate  her husband on making this happen. Knowing Anju, I am confident she  wont be content with winning the bronze in Paris. In fact,  she must already have set her sight on Athens. Of course,  the Olympics should be more competitive, yet its not beyond  Anju. Does she have it in her to get  a medal in Athens? The answer is yes. Firstly because of  her own attitude, and then because of the kind of training  programme she is undergoing. More importantly, unlike most  Indian athletes, Anju at least comes close to her national  best whenever she is overseas.  Discus thrower Neelam J. Singh,  despite her immense experience, was not able to reproduce  much of the national that she has been giving back home.  I wasnt too satisfied seeing her finish 12th among 13 participants. Obviously Anju is going to inspire  an entire generation of athletes, and thats so much good  news today. However, the aspiring athletes must also learn  from her attitude. Only then will Indian athletics take  a significant step forward.  Also, given Anjus success, the  authorities must go out of their way to ensure that those  with potential have the best of facilities made available  to them. In athletics, this translates to being able train  and compete in Europe and the US.  Remember how she clinched the  silver at the Stockholm Super GP? You know, these successes  provide that vital confidence jump to an athlete. What was I doing last night? Actually,  I was a little tense, and it was through the Internet that  I first came to know that Anju has got that medal.  My message to her would be to  not lose sight of her target and nothing, not even the spate  of felicitations that await her should take her eye off  that bulls eye.  And why not? She has been blessed  with a good height and a good physique. For a jumper, thats  excellent. She must utilise these physical attributes to  the fullest. I wish her all the best. Copyright

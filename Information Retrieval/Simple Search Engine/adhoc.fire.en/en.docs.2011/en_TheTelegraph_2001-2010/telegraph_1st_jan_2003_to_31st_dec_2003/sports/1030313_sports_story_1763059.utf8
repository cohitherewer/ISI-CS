 Pak panel summons selectors
 Inzamam: Fight with Younis Khan in focus Islamabad: The criteria adopted to pick the Pakistan squad for the World Cup has come under fire with the committee appointed to inquire into the disastrous performance of the team summoning members of the selection committee, including chairman Wasim Bari, for an indepth discussion on the subject. The inquiry committee, headed by former Test cricketer and retired Pakistan army Colonel Naushad Ali, has also summoned team analyst Sikander Bakht and is expected to call some senior players including skipper Waqar Younis. The possibility is that the three selectors might face tough questions for not considering some of the potential youngsters, a PCB official told The News. Some players had also been reportedly selected even though they were not fully fit. The committee is also waiting for reports from team manager and former Pakistan diplomat Shahryar Khan, outgoing coach Richard Pybus and team doctor Riaz Ahmad, all of whom accompanied the team to South Africa. It is expected to focus on issues such as players discipline, fitness and their alleged reluctance to listen to the coach. The managers report is expected to focus on the much-publicised fight between Inzaman-ul Haq and Younis Khan during a practice football match. Pakistan had a dismal World Cup campaign, winning only against minnows Holland and Namibia. They lost to Australia, England and arch-rivals India while their last match against Zimbabwe was washed out.  (PTI)  Copyright

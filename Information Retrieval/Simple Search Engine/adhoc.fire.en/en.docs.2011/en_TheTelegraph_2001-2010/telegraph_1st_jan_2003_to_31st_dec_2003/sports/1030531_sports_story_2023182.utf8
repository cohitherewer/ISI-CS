 Real pray for a Sociedad slip
 Ronaldo feels a desperate Valencia can push Sociedad Madrid: With the race for the Spanish title heading for a photo-finish, Real Sociedad and Real Madrid know that any slip-up could hand the decisive advantage to their rivals. Sociedad lead Real by a point with just three games left, and the Basque side has the added advantage that if the pair are level on points at the end of the season they will take the title because of their better record in head-to-heads. Sociedad will be aiming to hold their nerve when they take on Valencia at home Sunday, while Real host high-flying Celta Vigo at the Bernabeu Saturday. But Ronaldo, who scored both goals in Reals gritty 2-1 win over Valencia at the Mestalla last week, believes that last seasons champions are likely to provide a major obstacle to Sociedads title ambitions. I hope Sociedad slip up as soon as possible, he said. Valencia have to win to get into next seasons Champions League and it is going to be a very interesting game. But Sociedad have their own fate in their hands and midfielder Javi de Pedro believes that it is Real who are on edge.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

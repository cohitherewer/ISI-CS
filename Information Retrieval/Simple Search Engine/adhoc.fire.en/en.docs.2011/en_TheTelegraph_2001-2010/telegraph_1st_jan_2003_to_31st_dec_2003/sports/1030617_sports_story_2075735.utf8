 Rinku hattrick in Bengal win
Chennai: Rinku Ghoshs hattrick helped Bengal beat Assam 3-0 in a quarter final league match of the 11th national womens football championship Monday. In another match, Bihar managed to score a goal four minutes before time to beat Maharashtra. Bengal controlled the game right from the beginning. Their interceptions were excellent and the medios and wingers worked in tandem. They could have won the match with a bigger margin, but for Assam goalkeeper Dhwrwmsuli Boro who came up with few good saves. Bengal forwards were also to be blamed for squandering a few gilt-edged opportunities. Rinku was the pick of the lot, scoring her first goal in the opening minute after missing a chance a few seconds into the match. Assams defensive ploy prevented Bengal from increasing the margin in the first half. After the breather, Rinkus first timer from 25 yards helped Bengal go 2-0 up and in the 66th minute she came up with another superb effort. Following a cross from Swapna Guria, Rinku met the ball about ten feet away from the goal and booted the ball in with finesse. Bihar, a better-rated team, were seen struggling against Maharashtras defensive tactics. However, a single slip up by Shahina Khan close to the Maharashtra goal developed into a melee, resulting in a flag kick for Bihar which was taken by Annu Kumari. Her lob went to Anjana Rani and following a tussle the ball ran loose to Shahina. But Sevanjali Kumari latched on to it and slammed it home.  (PTI)  Copyright

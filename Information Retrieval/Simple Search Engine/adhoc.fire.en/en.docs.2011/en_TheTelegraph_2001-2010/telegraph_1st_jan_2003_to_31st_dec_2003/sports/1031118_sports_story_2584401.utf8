The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Im most relaxed with those who mean most 
 - My father remains my role modelbut Blessed Teresa is the one non-sportsperson I admire the most, says Sachin  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly at the Eden on Monday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Thirty-one Test centuries and 36 three-figure knocks in ODIs All that and more is well-documented. Yet, much as many crave, few know anything at all about Sachin Tendulkar the person. This has, perhaps, only added to his mystique. Recently, The Telegraph spoke to the 30-year-old icon, idea being to unravel at least something. The following are excerpts Q Even 14 years after your debut, very few are in the know about the person you are. Have you consciously encouraged this? A My personal life must remain personal and, really, people should (only) know more about the cricketer in me Fair enough, but can a public figure actually have a private life? May become difficult but, if you ask me, there are things which must always remain within the family In any case, I prefer privacy as Im a very reserved person. Im not comfortable with For me, the quieter the better. Does an encroachment upset you? I dont get upset, but do try to explain that Im entitled to quality time with my family The calendar is so demanding that every moment (with the family) is special. Indeed, Im particular about the time spent with my kids (Sara and Arjun) I should be allowed to take in the joy of being around them When Im with the family, I dont have to worry about scoring Dont have to worry about the next ball Yes, Im most relaxed when Im with those who mean the most to me. Given that you cant move about everywhere, what do you miss most? Look, Ive been playing for India since the age of 16 itself and, if you think of it, certain habits grow in the 16-20 age group. So, in my case, I was already a known face early in life. Therefore some habits, which could have grown, simply didnt. (After a pause) Barring a couple of things here and there, I havent missed anything Today, I have no regrets and, as a person, havent changed: I prefer homely food and a homely ambience. When Ive switched off cricket, thats what I enjoy most. It seems Anjali and you have made it a point to keep the children away from the limelight Thats because the focus should be on me Im the cricketer and I dont see why the kids must suffer They should be allowed to enjoy every minute of their childhood. After all, those years wont ever return Moreover, I want both Sara and Arjun to grow up as normal children I dont want them being accorded special status or whatever In fact, Im associated with a charity (Apnalaya) and encourage my kids to interact with the underprivileged children. If I could add, Sara and Arjun enjoy those outings and Im happy. How do you deal with your kids? (Grins) Im patient and try not to get angry Try to correct mistakes Anjali, though, is the one responsible for their upbringing Being a paediatrician, she understands them better. What did you learn from your parents (Ramesh and Rajani)? My father never lost his temper Didnt shout Given that he was always so calm, its no surprise that everybody sought his guidance whenever there was a problem. And, here, Im not just talking of the immediate family I dont think anybody took a big decision without his advice Whatever the problem, my father had some solution. Clearly, he was the guiding force for everybody  far and near My mother, of course, complemented him. In your book, who is the ideal parent? Perhaps, somebody like my father He remains my role model. (After a pause) I never got to meet her, but Blessed Teresa has also been a big influence She is the one non-sportsperson I admire the most. The present-day parents seem quite pushy I agree theres more pressure on children Its possible that parents are getting influenced by TV and feel there are benefits in pushing their kids into something from an early age Surely, thats not right? Dont know Im not an expert. However, what I can say is that children shouldnt be pushed into doing something The parents must understand and respect the kids inclination towards a particular subject and encourage him/her Support what the child likes The final question: What did your family environment teach you? The importance of values, respect Total commitment towards the preferred vocation Ive been privileged.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PCB still undecided on Latif
 - Gen. Zia-Rameez meeting scheduled for tomorrow  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) hasnt yet decided whether to seek an explanation from regular captain and wicketkeeper Rashid Latif on the cheating episode in the Multan Test versus Bangladesh. Latif has been banned for five ODIs and will be eligible for selection only after the ongoing limited overs series. Match Referee Mike Procter, it may be recalled, booked him for unfairly claiming a catch (Alok Kapalis off Yasir Ali) and setting a poor example as captain. Incidentally, Latif had the right to appeal within 24 hours of the Match Referees verdict (on Sunday), but declined to do so. Its not clear whether the PCB advised him not to pursue an issue which has dented his and  more important  Pakistans image. The PCB, though, was quick to elevate Inzamam-ul-Haq as stand-in captain. For now, Kamran Akmal is wearing the big gloves. Actually, neither the chairman (Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia) nor I have had the opportunity to discuss the matter Having said that, we will be meeting on Sunday, during the Lahore ODI, and a stand could be taken, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja told The Telegraph late on Friday. For his part, Rameez indicated that Latifs clean record till the Multan episode  something which influenced Procter  wont be disregarded when Gen. Zia and he deliberate at the Gaddaffi. Its another matter that the Match Referee should have judged the incident on merit without flipping through Latifs CV and being reminded of his role in exposing match-fixers. Having played with Latif, I can vouch for his being an honest person Im not condoning his act but, at the same time, Im not convinced he needs to be crucified. Of course, thats a strictly personal view, Rameez added. While Bangladesh called for a Level Four punishment (as listed in the Code of Conduct), Procter chose to treat Latifs behaviour as being worthy of a Level Three penalty. For a Level Three offence, the punishment is being banned for between two and four Tests or between four and eight ODIs. The Level Four penalty is much stiffer: A ban of anywhere between five Tests or ten ODIs. Plus, theres a life ban provision. Twenty six months ago, by the way, another wicketkeeper  West Indies Ridley Jacobs  was banned for three ODIs after winning a dubious stumping appeal against Virender Sehwag in a tri-series in Zimbabwe. Its to be seen whether the PCB initiates any action, but the International Cricket Council must consider empowering the third umpire to intervene when replays confirm that the on-field gentleman has erred. Only the short-sighted will argue that such a move will encroach on the on-field umpires jurisdiction. Eleven years should really be time enough for a world body to fully embrace technology  not merely experiment with it.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sasi eyeing 2700 mark
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Krishnan Sasikiarn, Indias No. 2 chess player, is pretty sure of what he wants to do. He makes no bones about the fact that cracking the coveted 2700 Elo rating mark is his goal and how and when he thinks he would make it. In the city to officially inaugurate the website of Dibyendu Baruas proposed chess academy, the Chennai-based GM said: Crossing 2700 is my goal and I want to do it this very season. He has been in fine form this year, including a first place finish amid a strong field including Alexi Dreev at the North Sea Cup in Denmark. Sasikiran, rated 2654 currently, admitted that opening is the area he needs to work on. To achieve what I want, I have to improve my opening. He added he is working hard on that front. I often get to interact with Viswanathan Anand over the e-mail. He offers suggestions and I try my best to implement them in my game, he said. Sasikiran is the only other Indian after Anand to have gone past the 2650 mark. Sasikiran, who became Indias fifth Granmaster in 2000, also felt Barua is a good friend of his and he discusses strategies whenever he gets the time. In fact, I would like to catch up with Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Neelotpal Das as well during the visit, he added.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, September 11, 2003  Senor Pele set to score again 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 Dhariwal				 										Mysore: Jaggy Dhariwals ward Senor Pele, who surprised a good opposition last week, looks good to score an encore in the 1,200m R. W. I. T. C. Trophy, the main event in Thursdays race card here.				 										The Tejano-Erin On Your Toes gelding, according to his showing last week, seems to be a cut above his six rivals. Rio Tinto and Almond may spell danger to him. But with apprentice Chandrashekar claiming an allowance of five kg, it may be easy picking for Senor Pele.

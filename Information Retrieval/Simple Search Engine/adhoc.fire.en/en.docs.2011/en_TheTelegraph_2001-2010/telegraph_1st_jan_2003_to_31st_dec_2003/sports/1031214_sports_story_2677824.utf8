 Dilshan puts Lanka on top
 Tillekeratne Dilshan after reaching his century on the fourth day of the second Test in Kandy on Saturday. (Reuters) Kandy, Dec. 13 (Reuters): England were left facing a fight for survival on the last day after being set a 368-run target to win the second Test following Tillekeratne Dilshans century for Sri Lanka. Dilshans second Test century  also the first hundred of the series  allowed Sri Lanka to declare their first innings on 279 for seven at tea. Sri Lanka claimed the wickets of Marcus Trescothick (14) and Mark Butcher (6) during the final session to leave England on 89 for two. Trescothick, fortunate to survive a leg-before appeal on eight, was caught at slip off Chaminda Vaas while Butcher was stumped off Muttiah Muralidharan  a marginal decision by the TV umpire. England captain Michael Vaughan provided some resistance, finishing the day unbeaten on 50 from 104 balls  his second fifty of the match. He was supported by former captain Nasser Hussain, who survived a close leg-before shout first ball against Muralidharan, to finish on 17 not out. Dilshan, playing his first Test match since March 2001, followed his 63 in the first innings with a sparkling 100 from 121 balls, an aggressive innings that included 13 fours and one six. The 27-year-old added 153 for the fourth wicket with Mahela Jayawardene (52) to rescue Sri Lanka from a shaky 53 for three after the fall of two early wickets on the fourth morning. The partnership was a fourth-wicket record against England, surpassing the 148 between Sidath Wettimuny and Arjuna Ranatunga at Lords in 1984. Left-arm spinner Ashley Giles was Englands most successful bowler, taking three for 101 from 22 overs. He thus finished with eight for 217 in the game. England had started the morning brightly as James Kirtley straightened a full-length delivery sufficiently to catch Sanath Jayasuriyas (27) inside edge and flatten his off stump in the third over. Kumar Sangakkara (10) was surprised by some extra bounce and caught by Paul Collingwood at short-leg off glove and pad. With the lead still a moderate 141, England were back in the game, but Dilshan seized back the initiative with a stunning counter-attack. England coach Duncan Fletcher urged his players to take heart from their back-to-the-wall escape in Galle as they try to save the second Test. The players need to take heart out of what they did in the last Test and make sure they do the same if not better it this time, Fletcher said. Fletcher believes the controversy sparked by the alleged sledging by Nasser Hussain at Muttiah Muralidharan has helped pull the team together, leaving the players ready for a final day scrap. You could see the guys suddenly realising, hold on we have a battle on here, lets stick together and go out there and do well in this Test, added the coach.  Copyright

 Historic WI call-up for Omari Banks
 JACOBS: Doubtful starter Georgetown: Off-spinner Omari Banks became the first player from the tiny leeward island of Anguilla to be selected to the senior West Indies cricket team on Monday. The 20-year-old Banks and Ramnaresh Sarwan of Guyana are included in a 15-man squad to face Australia in the second Test, which starts in Trinidad on Saturday. Sarwan, who was nominated vice-captain, has fully recovered from a fractured middle finger on his left hand. The 22-year-old had a final workout on the Bourda on Sunday following Australias nine-wicket victory in the first of four Tests. Banks is included as the only specialist spinner. The 13 players who were selected for the first Test remain on the squad, although wicket-keeper Ridley Jacobs is likely to miss out after tearing a muscle in his groin during the West Indies loss. He will get a second opinion on the severity of the injury once the squad arrives in Trinidad. The squad Brian Lara (captain), Ramnaresh Sarwan, Wavell Hinds, Devon Smith, Daren Ganga, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Marlon Samuels, Ridley Jacobs, Carlton Baugh, David Bernard, Omari Banks, Vasbert Drakes, Mervyn Dillon, Pedro Collins, Jermaine Lawson. Coach: Gus Logie. Manager: Ricky Skerritt. Waugh likely to play Meanwhile, Australia captain Steve Waugh is expected to play in the second Test despite having stitches in a hand injury, a team spokesman said on Monday. At the moment its a matter of seeing how it heals up, the spokesman said. The general consensus is that he will (play). To say hes doubtful is probably too strong. Its really more a question of the pain than anything else. Waugh suffered a deep cut to the webbing between his fingers while fielding a ball during the first Test on Saturday. He went off the field to have six stitches but returned after lunch and said later that he would have been able to bat in his teams second innings if necessary. His injury was not a major issue at the post-match media conference on Sunday. Asked if he would play, Waugh said: Its a Test match, isnt it? Waughs toughness is legendary in cricket. A shattered nose didnt keep the Australian captain out of a Test in Sri Lanka almost four years ago after a mid-field collision with a teammate and he only missed one Test in England despite tearing a hole in his calf muscle in 2001.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Coach wants action on two
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, peeved at the continuous absence of Chandan Das and M. Suresh, has asked the club officials to showcause the duo as a disciplinary action. The club officials are refusing to rush a decision on the issue but Bhowmick makes no bones about the fact that a strong disciplinary statement is the need of the hour as his team leaves for Goa on Friday to take on Salgaocar on Sunday. While M. Suresh is yet to return from Kozhikhode where has been reportedly receiving ayurvedic treatment for his injured knee, Chandan has preferred to play for his office (RBI). Bhowmick admitted on Thursday that the loss of injured Dipak and Suresh will force him to reorganise the backline but his target from the three away matches would be seven points. I will love to gain nine out of nine, but realistically speaking, two wins and a draw will be good enough, he said. East Bengal face Vasco on Thursday next and JCT in Ludhiana on December 9. Meanwhile, Bhowmick included veteran Tushar Rakshit in the 18-member squad for the first three matches. We need experienced players in away matches, he said. The other members include Sangram Mukherjee, Sandip Nandy, Suley Musah, Surya Bikash Chakraborty, Sur Kumar Singh, Mahesh Gawli, Debjit Ghosh, Subhas Chakraborty, Sasthi Duley, Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Sujoy Dutta, Alvito DCunha, Douglas Da Silva, Dipankar Roy, Mike Okoro and Bhaichung Bhutia.

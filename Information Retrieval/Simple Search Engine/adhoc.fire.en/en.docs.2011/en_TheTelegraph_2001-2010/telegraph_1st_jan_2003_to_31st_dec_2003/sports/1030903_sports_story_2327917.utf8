 Ritwick aims to crack world top-30 
New Delhi: With an historic triumph in the PSA world ranking tournament in his kitty, Indias ace squash player Ritwick Bhattacharya now aims to break into the top 30 in the next two years. My immediate aim is to qualify for the world open to be played in Lahore in December. And this will surely help me to attain a place in the top 30 in a couple of year, Ritwick, the first Indian player to ever win a PSA ranking tournament, said. Ritwick won two back-to-back PSA ranking tournaments in New Zealand last month, which saw his world ranking climb to 72. The three-time national champion said he would be playing a few more ranking tournaments in Spain and Qatar as he needed to break into the top 64 to qualify for the world open. The 24-year-old from Delhi, who is currently training n London under former UK No. 1 Neil Harvey alongside some of the worlds best players for two years now, said: After an indifferent last year everything has started falling into place and I am confident that I can make it to the top in world squash. Pointing out that Indians play a lot of instinctive squash which affects consistency, Riwtick said he was concentrating more on improving his technique and fitness to compete on the world stage. My game actually dropped in the first year. I was focussing more on absorbing the exposure I was getting. Now I am confident about myself and believe that I can make it to the top, he said.

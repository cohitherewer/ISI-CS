The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harbhajan hopes to get rhythm back
 - This side is really keen to become one of the best in Test cricket: Laxman  Harbhajan feels hes taking time to adjust to the wickets Adelaide: Indias bowling trumpcard Harbhajan Singh on Tuesday admitted he was struggling to adjust to Australian conditions but said there was no cause for panic yet. The off spinner, who emerged as the Turbanator by decimating the Australians in the 2000 series at home, was hammered for 169 runs in 35 overs while picking just one wicket, raising doubts about his form. I can bowl much better than this. I was not getting my rhythm right. It is not turning as much as it does in India. It is taking me time to adjust to these wickets, said the offie on his arrival here. Harbhajan sought to draw some lessons from the pounding he got in the drawn Gabba Test saying sometimes you learn a lot when you get hammered. Great bowlers like Shane Warne and (Muttiah) Muralidharan also get hammered. You cant be performing all the time. You cant take five wickets every time you bowl. So I should not be thinking too much about it. I should think how I can take wickets in the next match. He said he would try and bowl his natural line and length and pick wickets the next time around. I did not bowl my natural line and length (at Gabba). If I bowl to my potential I know I can get wickets on any track  not just Australia but anywhere. Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly had appeared concerned about Harbhajans form but took care not to run him down by suggesting that bowlers could also have off-days. He is not bowling well enough. He is a much better bowler than what he bowled in this Test (at gabba), Sourav had said. And the player who seems to be enjoying sublime form  VVS Laxman  said he was looking to improve further and so were his teammates. This side is really keen on improving day by day and wants to become one of the best sides ever in Test cricket, so we are all looking to improve on our skills. There is always room for improvement and we will definitely discuss that before the (second) Test starts, Laxman said. On his more illustrious teammate Sachin Tendulkar, who fell victim to a dubious decision and did not come out to bat in Indias second knock due to a stiff back, Laxman said the team was expecting something big from the little genius. I am sure that he will come up with some big runs in the rest of the series. He has done well for so many years, so I think it is time everyone realised that he is the best batsman in the world.

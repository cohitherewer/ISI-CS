 Anand shocked 
Linares: Viswanathan Anands bid to win the 20th Linares Super Grandmasters chess tournament suffered a jolt when he was shocked by Hungarian Peter Leko in the 13th round. Anands loss almost put him out of the race for first place as Leko replaced him as joint leader with Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. Leko and Kramnik have 6.5 points from 11 games and will clash in the final round.  (PTI)  Copyright

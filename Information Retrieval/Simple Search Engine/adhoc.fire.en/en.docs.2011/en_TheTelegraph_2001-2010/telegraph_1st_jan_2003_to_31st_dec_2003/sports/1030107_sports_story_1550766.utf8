		 Tuesday, January 07, 2003 				 Court wants a PCB ruling on Wasim Akram
																								Islamabad: Taking up the plea of fast bowler Wasim Akram against a ban on regaining captaincy, a high court Monday ordered the Pakistan Cricket Board to make a final ruling on the matter within 30 days. The order was passed by Justice M. Javed Buttar of the Lahore high court.																								Akram, who was embroiled in a match-fixing controversy two years ago, was fined by one-man Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum inquiry commission which also advised the PCB not to reinstate the cricketer as a captain of the national side.																								Protesting against the ban, Akram filed a petition in the court after his appeal to PCB to remove the ban failed to evoke any response.																								I want to clear my name and live a satisfied life because there is life after cricket as well. If I want to take up a job after I hang my boots I must have a clean and clear name and its only because of that I had filed the appeal, he was quoted as saying by the official news agency. (PTI)

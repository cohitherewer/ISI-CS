 Bradmans cap gets record bid
- Memorabilia sale London: The baggy green cap worn by Australian cricket legend Don Bradman in the 1946-47 Ashes series was sold for a record auction price of $58,600 on Tuesday.Christies auction house said the cap was bought by an Australian collector who lives in London. It is the highest price ever paid for a cricket cap, Christies said. The buyer, who was not identified, plans to add the cap to his private cricket collection but also hopes to display it in Australia.As we were getting ready to auction the cap, there was a hum of excitement in the room, said a Christies spokesman. And the bidding took a couple of minutes. After we sold it, there was a clap in the room, which you dont always have.A bat Bradman used on the tour of England in 1930 went for $48,850 to another collector. Bradman hit 232 runs with the bat in the tours fifth Test.Bradmans teammate Keith Miller claimed he swapped caps with the Australian captain before the first Ashes Test in Brisbane in November 1946 but Christies said they were sure of the green caps authenticity. The legends name was hand-written on the manufacturers label, and the cap matched Bradmans size.Bradman, who died two years ago, is considered by many to be the best batsman ever to play cricket. He captained Australia from 1936-48 and made 19 centuries against England from 1928-48. The 1948 tour of England by Bradmans Invincibles, where they won the Test series 4-0, is still regarded as one of Australias greatest performances.A 1953 Miller cap was sold for $23,380, the previous high for Christies the spokesman said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Laxman skipper, Malhotra coach
 Mumbai: V.V.S. Laxman of Hyderabad will lead a 15-member India A squad that will participate in the Carib Beer cricket series (formerly known as Busta Cup) in the West Indies from February 8 to March 17. The stylish middle-order batsman missed out to Dinesh Mongia on a World Cup berth. Former Test batsman and national selector Ashok Malhotra has been appointed coach of the India team, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said here Friday. The A team will play six four-day matches  against Barbados (February 8-11), Leeward Islands (February 14-17), Trinidad (February 21-24), Windward Islands (February 28-March 3), Guyana (March 7-10) and Jamaica (March 14-17). We had requested the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) to defer the India A teams matches by a few days as the players would be busy with four crucial Ranji Trophy elite group matches from Saturday and the WICB agreed to it, Nair added. THE SQUAD V.V.S. Laxman (captain), Akash Chopra, Connor Williams, Gautam Gambhir, A.T. Rayudu, Abhijit Kale, Hemang Badani, Rakesh Patel, Avishkar Salvi, L. Balaji, Tinu Yohannan, Ajay Ratra, Murali Kartik, Amit Mishra and J.P. Yadav. Coach: Ashok Malhotra.  (PTI)  Copyright

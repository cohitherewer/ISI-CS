 ICC judge to hear appeal
Rawalpindi: A judge appointed by the ICC will rule on an appeal by South African allrounder Andrew Hall against a two Test ban for breaching ICCs Code of Conduct, a statement said Sunday. Former English High Court Judge Sir Oliver Popplewell will hear Halls appeal, the ICC statement said. Popplewell is the England and Wales Cricket Boards nominated member of the ICCs Code of Conduct Commission and has been appointed as appeals commissioner for Halls case by ICCs legal counsel, Urvasi Naidoo, the statement said. ICC said the South African team touring Pakistan has been informed about the decision. The process for conducting the hearing is left to the discretion of the appeals commissioner who will hear and determine Halls case within the next seven days. The appeal relates to an initial hearing in Rawalpindi in which ICC Match Referee Clive Lloyd found Hall guilty of two breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct following an apparent on-pitch elbowing incident. On making his decision, the appeals commissioner will provide a written decision to the ICC which will be forwarded to all parties concerned. He has the power to increase, decrease, amend or otherwise substitute his own decision for that of the original adjudicator. The decision of the appeals commissioner will be final and binding, said the release. On Saturday, UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola voiced his concern over inconsistencies in the application of the ICC Code of Conduct on international cricketers. While I in no way condone any behaviour which breaches the Code of Conduct, I am extremely concerned at the inconsistent manner in which that code has been applied, Majola said.

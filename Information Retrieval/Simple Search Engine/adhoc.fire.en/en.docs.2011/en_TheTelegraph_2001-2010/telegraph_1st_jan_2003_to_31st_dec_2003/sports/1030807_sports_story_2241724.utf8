The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain available for third Test 
London: Nasser Hussain, who resigned as England captain after the first Test against South Africa, has told the England selectors he will be available for selection for next weeks third Test. Hussains availability was welcomed by the chairman of selectors, David Graveney, as there had been speculation the Essex batsman would follow pace bowler Darren Goughs example and announce his retirement. Its good news for everyone, Graveney told the BBCs website on Wednesday. Hussain, 35, surprised most observers by resigning his post after last Mondays drawn first Test against South Africa at Edgbaston. South Africa crushed England by an innings and 92 runs in the second Test at Lords on Sunday.  The third Test starts at Trent Bridge on August 14.  (AFP)  Copyright

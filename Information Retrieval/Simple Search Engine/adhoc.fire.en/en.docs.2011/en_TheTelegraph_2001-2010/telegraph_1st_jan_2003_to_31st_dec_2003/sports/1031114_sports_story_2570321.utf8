The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Humpy onslaught continues
Kozhikode: Top seed Koneru Humpy of Andhra Pradesh continued her victory march to remain the sole leader with eight points after as many rounds in the 30th National Womens A chess championship here on Thursday. The reigning Asian womens champion carried on her onslaught beating IWM Y. Prathiba of Tamil Nadu and Eesha Karvade of Maharashtra in the seventh and eighth rounds to reaffirm her supremacy in the 17-round all-play-all tournament. In a queen-pawn opening, Humpy, showing terrific form easily had the measure of Karvade in only 26 moves. The Vijaywada prodigy is further expected to carry on excellent show as she is scheduled to take on less-fancied Sai Meera on Friday to be followed by the experienced but out-of-form Bhagyashree Thipsay and Anupama Gokhale on Saturday. Humpy will be playing Asian runner-up and state-mate third seed Dronavalli Harika on Sunday and then the defending champion Aarthie Ramaswamy of Tamil Nadu. Meanwhile, former champion and second seed S. Vijayalakshmi, also of Tamil Nadu, who had a lethargic start, began closing the gap with the leader to finish with seven points and take second spot Aarthie and Nisha Mohota (LIC), the latest entrant to the WGM title, were holding the third position with six points apiece.

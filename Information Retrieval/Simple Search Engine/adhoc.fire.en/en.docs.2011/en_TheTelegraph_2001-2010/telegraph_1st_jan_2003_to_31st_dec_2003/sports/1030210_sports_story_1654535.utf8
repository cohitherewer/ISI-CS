The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latif puts Cup over India win
Johannesburg: Pakistan will not mind losing to arch-rivals India as long as the World Cup is won, according to Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif. Were obviously focused on beating India, because of the traditional rivalry, Latif told BBC Urdu. But if we lose to India and then win the World Cup, our defeat to them wont really matter. India and Pakistan clash in a league match at Centurion on March 1, the first between the two since June, 2000. Latif stressed winning the World Cup is more important than just a victory over India. Winning the World Cup is more significant because we lost to India in 1992 and ended up winning the tournament, he said. There was a lot of pressure in the past when we used to play regularly, but that has lessened in recent years because we havent really faced each other that often, he said. For fans around the world this would be the showcase match of the tournament. So of course well want to win, but the rest is in gods hands.  Pakistan have never defeated India in the World Cup, losing three times in succession in 1992, 1996 and 1999.  (AFP)  Copyright

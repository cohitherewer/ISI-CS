 Ecclestones India trip
Monza, Sept. 13 (PTI): Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone has accepted an invitation from Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu to visit Hyderabad during the Afro-Asian Games. Naidu, who is on a three-day mission here to woo F-1 racing to India, met Ecclestone, owner of motor racings elite event, at the Monza track on the sidelines of the Italian Grand Prix on Saturday. The meeting went off well and ended on a positive note. We are satisfied with the outcome, Naidu said after the 45-minute rendezvous with Ecclestone. Naidu said Ecclestone would be present either at the opening or closing ceremony. Hyderabad is aspiring to be the fourth Asian venue to host a multi-million dollar Formula One Grand Prix in 2006, at a site near Gachibowli on the outskirts. Japan and Malaysia have been hosting a race already while China has been allotted one in 2005.  Copyright

Aparna progressed with a 12-13, 11-9, 11-9 win over Germanys Petra Overizer, according to information received here. Aparna got a walk-over in the first round when Karina Dewitt, the sixth seed from Holland, conceded after leading 9-6 in the first game, having injured her calf muscle. (PTI)  Copyright

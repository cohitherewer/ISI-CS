The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Im just a caretaker: Steve
Bridgetown, May 3 (Reuters): Steve Waugh, who became the first Australian to make 30 Test centuries on Friday, played down the achievements afterwards and instead slammed the West Indies pitches. Im just a caretaker, Im sure Ricky Ponting will take over one day the 37-year-old said after breaking Donald Bradmans record of 29. Ive played a few more Tests than him (Bradman) so that puts it into perspective. Waugh was equally low-key about passing Sunil Gavaskars total of 10,122 runs to became the second highest scorer in Test history. Asked what it meant, he replied: Not much, really. Its nice but I havent thought about it at all. Waugh then turned his attention to the Kensington Oval pitch, where 694 runs have been scored in two days cricket in the third Test and only nine wickets taken. This has not been a typical West Indies tour, he said. Usually, when you come to the West Indies, balls are flying around your ears and the crowd are getting excited. This time, its low, flat and slow and its difficult for the crowd to get involved in the game. We heard it was going to be pacy and bouncy but Ive played 159 Tests and this is the slowest pitch Ive ever played on. Its disappointing to play on a pitch like this. Waugh had been hoping that Australia could become the first team to pull off a whitewash in the Caribbean after winning the first two Tests but was less confident after the first two days in Bridgetown. Its so difficult to get batsmen out here but its amazing what can happen if you put a team under pressure. I wouldnt say Im confident but Im hopeful.  Copyright

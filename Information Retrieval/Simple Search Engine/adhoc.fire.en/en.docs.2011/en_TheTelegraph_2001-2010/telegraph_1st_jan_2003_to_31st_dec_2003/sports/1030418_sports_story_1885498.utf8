 US face drugs cover-up charge
London: Documents purporting to show that a number of American athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics after failing drug tests prove long-held suspicions of US drug cover-ups, the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency has said. Dr Wade Exum, the former USOC director for drug control from 1991 to 2000, released more than 30,000 pages of documents to Sports Illustrated. He says they show that athletes such as Carl Lewis and Mary Joe Fernandez tested positive but were allowed by the US Olympic committee to compete anyway. The Orange County register reviewed more than 10,000 confidential USOC documents for a story about the committees failure to deal with doping issues.  (AP)  Copyright

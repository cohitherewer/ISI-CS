 Mark Viduka escapes fine 
Leeds: Australian striker Mark Viduka has been let off a  130,000 fine imposed by sacked Leeds boss Peter Reid. Eddie Gray, the man who has taken over at Elland Road on a caretaker basis, moved immediately to mend fences with the temperamental Viduka, who has not played in Leeds last two matches following a series of bust-ups with Reid. Gray restored Viduka to the Leeds side for a testimonial match against Cambridge on Tuesday and later confirmed he would be waiving the fine of two weeks wages the striker received from Reid last week. Ill be taking no action against Mark, said Gray, a former Leeds coach.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deadline for Kluivert 
Barcelona: Barcelona have given Dutch star Patrick Kluivert until July 17 to sign a new contract or leave. Kluivert has been linked with a move to join teammate Ruud van Nistelrooy at Manchester United and with Arsenal. Barcelona have told Kluivert they plan to cut his wages and the player is now free to activate a clause which would let him leave for a cut-price 1.8 million euros ($2 million).  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United go down
London: Arsenal opened a three-point lead at the top of the early Premier League standings with a 2-1 victory at Manchester City after Manchester United lost 1-0 at Southampton on Sunday. Arsenal recovered from a Lauren own goal with strikes by Sylvain Wiltord and Freddie Ljungberg to make it four straight wins, their best start since 1947, and move to 12 points. Champions United, the only other team to win their first three games, were sunk by James Beatties 88th-minute header and remained second on nine points. Cameroon defender Lauren, under pressure from Trevor Sinclair as he ran towards his own goal, sliced the ball past a bemused Jens Lehmann to give City a 10th-minute lead, which they did not look like losing as Arsenal failed to spark in the first half. However, French forward Wiltord, left unmarked in the box, scrambled an equaliser three minutes after the break and Arsenal dominated the rest of the match. Lehmann saved twice in a minute to deny Antoine Sibierski and Nicolas Anelka during a lively City spell midway through the second half but a defensive mix-up between Chinas Sun Jihai and former Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman allowed Ljungberg to poke the visitors ahead after 72 minutes. United looked jaded as they suffered their first league defeat since last December.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

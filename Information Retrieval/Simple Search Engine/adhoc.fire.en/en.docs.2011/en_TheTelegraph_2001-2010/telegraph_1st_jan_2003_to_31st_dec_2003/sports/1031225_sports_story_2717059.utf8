		 Thursday, December 25, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Melbourne: Pat Rafter is to play doubles at the Australian Open next month, the tournaments chief executive Paul McNamee said on Wednesday.				 																																	McNamees announcement came a day after Australian hardcourt championships director Colin Stubs said the former world No. 1, who retired at the start of 2003, would play doubles as a wildcard entrant in that event next month in Adelaide.				 																																	However Stubs said Rafter, who turns 31 on Sunday, was not planning a comeback to the professional circuit and McNamee refused to speculate on the topic on Wednesday.				 																																	Hell be a really good addition to the tournament and for the fans in particular. The fans will get a kick out of it, McNamee said. 				 																																	Its been on the cards for a while, especially when Pat was ordering the tournament balls a few weeks ago. Thats always a positive sign.				 																																	Halifax (Nova Scotia): Police discriminated against former Olympic boxer Kirk Johnson when they ticketed and seized his ford mustang, a provincial human rights commission has ruled.				 																																	In the commissions report, inquiry chair Philip Girard on Tuesday said that race was a major factor in the way constable Michael Sanford dealt with Johnson, who is black, when the car was pulled over on April 12, 1998. 				 																																	Im happy with the victory, but Im disappointed that it took five long years, Johnson said. You got to fight for your rights. Theres no sense living life and letting people kick you around.				 																																	Girard ruled Johnson, 31, is entitled to damages of $ 7,600 plus travel expenses.				 																																	London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is not planning to buy any new players in the January transfer window, despite revealing that Chelseas spending spree upped the pressure on his team to regain the Premier League title.				 																																	The Londoners, double winners in 2001-02, added only German keeper Jens Lehmann to their squad in the close season while Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich splashed out over 100 million on fresh talent from around Europe.				 																																	Wenger said on Tuesday he could see no immediate need to bolster the squad already well placed in joint second with Chelsea. At the moment, I m not in the market. I don t see any reasonable target, he said.				 																																	Sao Paulo: Brazil star Roberto Carlos has said he is in talks to renew his contract with Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid, most likely on a multi-year basis.				 																																	I like Spain very much and I would like to stay there, Carlos said on Tuesday. He said the objective of the talks was to extend his current contract, which expires in June 2005, for several years.  However, he declined to say how many years the  new contract might encompass. Sport on Screen Cricket: A team tri-series, India A vs Pakistan  A live from 8.45 am on DD Sports

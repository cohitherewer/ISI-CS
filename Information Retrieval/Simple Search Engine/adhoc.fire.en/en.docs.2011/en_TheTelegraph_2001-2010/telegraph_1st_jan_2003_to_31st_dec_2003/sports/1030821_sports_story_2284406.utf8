The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bashar shines for Bangla
 Bangladesh Javed Omar Belim is bowled by Pakistans Omar Gul on Day I of first Test in Karachi on Wednesday. (Reuters) Karachi: Habibul Bashar led a much-improved performance by Bangladesh on Day I of their opening Test match against Pakistan on Wednesday. Bashar made a brilliant 71, and despite struggling in the middle of their innings, the tourists finished the day at 278 for nine after bad light forced an early end with seven overs remaining. Bangladesh, put into bat, had a good chance to put up a big total following a second- wicket stand of 114 runs between Bashar and Hanan Sarkar. Bashar finally got out miscuing a cut off paceman Shoaib Akhtar. But his effort helped Bangladesh go past their previous highest total of 160 against Pakistan made in Chittagong last year. The Bashar-Sarkar pair batted with confidence after losing Javed Omar for one. Bashar, the only Bangladesh batsman to go past the 1,000-run mark, drove and cut to take Bangladesh to 97 for one at lunch. But soon after the interval, both of them fell within the space of three balls. I am disappointed not to have carried on and score a century, Bashar said later. Shoaib, Umar Gul and Shabbir took two wickets each.  (AFP)  Copyright

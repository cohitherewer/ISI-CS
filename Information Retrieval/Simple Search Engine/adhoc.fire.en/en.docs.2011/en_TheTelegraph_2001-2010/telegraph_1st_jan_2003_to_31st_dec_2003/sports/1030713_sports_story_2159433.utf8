The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ball in Sarins court, focus on Mehra
- The Ajay Jadeja case BEFORE DELHI HIGH COURT BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Calcutta, July 12: The ball has just landed in Justice Manmohan Sarins court, but much of the focus in the Ajay Jadeja case remains on arbitrator Justice (retd) J.K. Mehra and his controversial award.For one, theres still disbelief over his refusal to allow the Board lawyers (J.M. Mukhi and Usha Nath Banerjee) to cross-examine Jadeja on the hundreds of calls  coinciding with the eve of matches and match days proper  from Chennai-based bookie S. Uttam Chand.[The Board, which has challenged the award, drew Justice Sarins attention to the arbitrators bias during Tuesdays hearing in the Delhi High Court. Justice Mehra, it may be recalled, quashed Jadejas five-year ban on January 27 this year. The award, of course, threatens to destroy Team India.] Then, according to The Telegraphs sources, the arbitration records saw inexplicable deletions. Apparently, no convincing explanation was forthcoming.One understands the Q amp;A session on Jadejas income from properties and his participation in an exhibition match in North America (in 2001), despite being banned from all forms of cricket till December 5, 2005, dont figure in black and white.Its to be seen, though, whether the deletions too are brought to Justice Sarins attention.Incidentally, had Justice Mehra allowed the Board to cross-examine Jadeja, the one-time (stand-in) limited overs India captain would have been exposed with a capital E.According to information available, the Boards reply, placed before Justice Mehra, included dozens of Chands cellphone printouts which listed calls to Jadeja  one even as late as 11.58 pm!Significantly, the printouts were part of the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBIs) affidavit before the Delhi High Court, when Jadejas writ was heard in mid-2001.That affidavit, by the way, took Jadeja to the cleaners, particularly on the calls bit. Till then, by furnishing Delhi network printouts only, he claimed there was no communication between him and Chand.Jadeja, however, hadnt reckoned the CBI would seek AirTels help in outsmarting him. In fact, an AirTel letter of May 3, 2001 to a senior CBI official read: We have gone through the contents of your letter (May 2, 2001) and the accompanying printout of mobile no. 98100-34882 and wish to inform you as under:The calls (both incoming and outgoing) relate only to that period when the mobile phone was active in the Delhi network of Bharti Cellular Ltd. Since this mobile is also having the roaming facility, the calls made/received if the mobile no. was outside Delhi network are not reflected in this printoutThe disbelief over Justice Mehras refusal on the cross-examination front is, to say the least, understandable.Meanwhile, besides the support of high-profile politicians, Jadeja is being backed by two members of the 1983 World Cup-winning XI. Both dont lack influence.For those following this case, the next hearing is slated for July 15.  Copyright

 ICC rejects SA appeal
 Halls offence is bad enough Islamabad: South Africa allrounder Andrew Hall will miss the two Tests against Pakistan as the ICC Code of Conduct commission member Oliver Popplewell rejected his appeal against the two-match ban. Popplewell upheld the decision made by Match Referee Clive Lloyd relating to the charge made against Hall for elbowing Yusuf Youhana during the third ODI between Pakistan and South Africa. Popplewell reached his decision after reviewing Lloyds report, the grounds of appeal submitted on behalf of Hall and viewing a video recording of the incident, a press release from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Tuesday. No one who has seen the video, and I have seen it four or five times, can be in any doubt that there was a very serious confrontation between Hall and Youhana and that a Level 3 charge was entirely appropriate, Popplewell said. The penalty relating to a Level 3 offence is a minimum of a two-Test ban. The judgement has now been formally passed to the ICC legal counsel and forwarded to the legal counsel acting for Hall, Lloyd and the United Cricket Board of South Africa.  (AFP)  Copyright

 ZCU re-elects Robert Mugabe
Harare: Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was re-elected official patron of his national cricket union here on Saturday for an eighth consecutive year. However, despite being unopposed at a crowded Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU), there were dissenters at the meeting. If we continue with Mr Mugabe, then protests and disruptions will continue, said watching white businessman Roger Stringer. His appointment is a political one and there should be a change away from that. Stringer, who runs a computer company, said he was voicing the concerns felt my many people. But ZCU chairman Peter Chingoka defended the election. The head of states patronage is purely ceremonial and he plays no part in our policies or direction. You are entitled to your opinion but you must also respect our position. At the World Cup in southern Africa earlier this year, Zimbabwe players Andy Flower and Henry Olonga won world-wide praise by donning black armbands to mourn what they called the death of democracy in their country.

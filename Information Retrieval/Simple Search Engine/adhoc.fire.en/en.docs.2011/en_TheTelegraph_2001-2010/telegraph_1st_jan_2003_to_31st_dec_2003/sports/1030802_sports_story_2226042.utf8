The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India to host 2005 edition
New Delhi: India has been selected as host of the 2005 Champions Trophy hockey tournament, but has missed out on staging the Junior World Cup, which will be held in Holland, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) sources said here Friday. India, which had bid for both the 2005 tournaments at the last FIH congress in Perth, had to be content with the six-nation elite tournament after the authorities decided to give the country the chance to host only one major championship in a year. We had made the bid for both the tournaments along with several other countries. We got the Champions Trophy, which will be held in Chennai, IHF sources said. We were a bit disappointed to lose the Junior World Cup since we are the defending champions, but are quite happy to host the Champions Trophy for the second time. The last time India hosted the Champions Trophy was in 1996, also in Chennai. The 27th edition of the prestigious tournament will held in November-December, while the Junior World Cup will be in August-September. This years Champions Trophy begins in Amstelveen, August 16. The next edition will be held in Lahore. Meanwhile, seeking to build on Indias impressive performances at the international level in recent weeks, stars Dhanraj Pillay and Ashish Ballal are embarking on moves to rope in more corporate support for the sport, adds another report from Bangalore. The Dhanraj-Ballal Academy in Bangalore, which has a mission to produce world-class players, is organising a nine-day hockey carnival for non-league playing corporate teams beginning here Saturday. The intention is to raise the level of hockey and to attract more companies to encourage the sport. (PTI)  Copyright

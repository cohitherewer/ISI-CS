 Coulthard win starts new era
 Coulthard Melbourne : McLarens David Coulthard won against the odds in Australia on Sunday as Formula Ones new era started with world champions Ferrari pushed off the podium for the first time since 1999. Ferraris five-time world champion Michael Schumacher finished fourth in a damaged car, ending his record run of 19 successive podiums, and the early exit of Brazilian teammate Rubens Barrichello put paid to a 54th rostrum in a row for the ace Italian racing team. Coulthard found both luck and strategy playing into his hands for a 13th career win. Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya was second in a Williams, blowing his chances of winning by spinning while in the lead 11 laps from the finish. McLarens young Finn Kimi Raikkonen was third, an extraordinary result for a driver who started from the pit lane after a late tyre change and a nightmare in Saturdays qualifying.

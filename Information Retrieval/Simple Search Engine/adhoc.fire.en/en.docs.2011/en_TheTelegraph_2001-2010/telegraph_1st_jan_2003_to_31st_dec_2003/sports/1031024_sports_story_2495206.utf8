 Advani in semi-finals
New Delhi: National champion Pankaj Advani on Thursday upset top seed Paithoon Phonbun of Thailand by six frames to two to enter the semi-finals of the World Snooker Championship being played at Jiangmen, China. His compatriots Vidya Pillai and R. Uma Devi, however, could not maintain their good run as they bowed out at the quarter final stage after losing to much better opponents, according to information received here. But the day belonged to the 19-year-old Bangalore-based cueist who yet again showed that he was matured enough to take on greater opponents on the world stage when he comprehensively outplayed the top seed. Advani now faces fifth seed Brendan Odonoghue of Ireland, who defeated fourth seed Dermot McGlinchey of Northern Ireland 6-1. Speaking from Jiangmen, Advani said: After two tough matches in the knockout stage, I started off well in the quarters against Phonbun with a 83 clearance break and then everything went on smoothly. Earlier, in the pre-quarter finals, Advani rallied from a 0-3 deficit to turn the tables on eight seed Elfed Evans of Wales 5-4. Vidya went down to second seed Wendy Jans of Belgium 18-67, 23-57, 29-66, 9-63 while Uma Devi lost to third seed Lynette Horburgh of Scotland 18-63, 21-60, 22-66, 28-110. In the womens section, Vidya and Uma Devi made an impressive start to the day as they won their pre-quarterfinal matches with ease.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Indian duo withdraws
New Delhi: The Indian Express has derailed even before it was off the starting block. The prospect of Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes joining hands on tennis courts came to nought when the duo was forced to withdraw from the $355,000 ATP Tour event in Long Island, New York, after the latter was laid low by the flu. Paes is at present recuperating in Orlando, Florida. (PTI)  Copyright

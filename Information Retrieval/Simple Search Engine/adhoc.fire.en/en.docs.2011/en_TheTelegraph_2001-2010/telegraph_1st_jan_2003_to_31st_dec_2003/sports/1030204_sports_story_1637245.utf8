The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara returns with fluent 45
 Bloemfontein: Brian Lara made 45 on his return as the West Indies cruised to a 41-run victory over Free State in a World Cup warm-up match on Monday. Lara, who has not played a ODI since September because of a mystery illness, batted fluently to help his side pile up 267 for eight from their 50 overs. Shivnarine Chanderpaul top-scored with an unbeaten 97, and opener Chris Gayle continued his good form with 44. In Ladysmith, Bangladesh paid the price for over-ambitious strokeplay in another warm-up match, losing to KwaZulu Natal by 38 runs at Settlers Park.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

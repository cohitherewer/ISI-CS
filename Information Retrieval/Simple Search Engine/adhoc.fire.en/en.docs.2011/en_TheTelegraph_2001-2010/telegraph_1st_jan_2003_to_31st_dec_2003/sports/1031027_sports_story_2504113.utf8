The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thrilled to be home, Sourav thanks doctors
 - Team India captain discharged a day earlier than expected  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav at a press conference after his release from a city clinic on Sunday. His father Chandi Ganguly is beside him. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Just the other evening, in a private conversation, Sourav Ganguly wasnt sure he would be match-fit in time for Team Indias departure for Australia in the third week of November. Yet, on Sunday afternoon, the captain walked out of Belle Vue  a day quicker than expected. For now, the abscess saga (which took centrestage two days before the Mohali Test) is something of the past. Its thrilling... Nine days ago, when I was operated upon (for the second time), I didnt expect to be out so soon... The pain, the pus... The restricted movement... Everything combined to make me feel low. However, thanks to my doctors  especially Sukumar Mukherjee and Mrinmoy Nandi  Im heading home, Sourav told The Telegraph. Speaking from his top-of-the-line Mercedes, as he neared his Behala residence, Sourav added: One keeps reading (negative) reports about the medical fraternity but, believe me, Im indebted to Mukherjee and Nandi... This morning, for instance, at the (first post-stitches) dressing, I didnt feel any pain nor was pus visible. Absolutely remarkable, going by what Id gone through... Sourav would have spent another day in the nursing home had he either experienced pain or the stitches showed traces of pus. On reaching home, he was welcomed by daughter Sana  who will celebrate her second birthday early next month  in Donas arms and brother Snehashish and his family. Later, Sourav remarked: It was quite an unusual homecoming... The thrill was different. Looking back, Sourav said he was on the verge of throwing up when he saw the wound (on the left upper thigh) before it came under the scalpel for the second time (after Mohali), on October 18. There was a big hole, or, as (physio) Andrew Leipus described  a crater... That sight itself made me feel worse... Then, even after the surgery here, the dressings were done under anaesthesia. Given that Id never before been hospitalised, it was tough. Predictably, the focus now is on complete recovery and rehab. For starters, the first dressing (at home) will be done on Tuesday. The stitches will be cut in two stages and, if all goes well, I should resume training in six days... Next Saturday, I suppose, Sourav pointed out. While the doctors, apparently, are aiming to get him fit for the November 6 tri-series game in Cuttack (against New Zealand), Sourav is hopeful of making himself available for the last two league matches  on November 12 in Bangalore (versus Australia) and November 15 in Hyderabad (against New Zealand). Fortunately, Sourav is a left-hander and, so, the risk of being targeted by quicks isnt a factor. But, then, diving to his natural side could cause problems initially. Mental toughness, therefore, will come into play in a big way. Sourav, of course, will be backing himself. Incidentally, trainer Gregory Kings restrictions have been put on hold for the time being. After all, today, Sourav requires a need-based diet. Once fit, he will be back to chicken preparations with only two drops of oil and sandwiches without butter...  Copyright

 ICC: Cricket has lot of potential in the US
New York: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is looking into the possibility of the US hosting some games at the 2007 cricket World Cup. The West Indies are the official hosts of the tournament. Nine members of the ICC development committee and seven delegates from the USA Cricket Association, including president Atul Rai, from Los Angeles, met here over the past two days discussing the potential growth of cricket in the United States. The ICC has been looking at the option of fast tracking cricket development in the US and this includes the possibility of some 2007 World Cup games being played in the US, Andrew Eade, the ICCs global development manager said here. The ICC executive will meet on June 20 in London to discuss the meetings held here. The ICC believes cricket has a lot of potential in the US. It has about 8,000 playing the games, said Eade. The ICC is anxious to develop cricket in the US and is prepared to help provide coaches and inject funds to improve facilities and venues. Former US cricket captain Zamin Amin, of New York, was excited about the prospect of the ICC helping cricket grow and the possibility of 2007 World Cup games being played here. It will be a good start because cricket has been stagnant here for a while, he said. (AFP)  Copyright

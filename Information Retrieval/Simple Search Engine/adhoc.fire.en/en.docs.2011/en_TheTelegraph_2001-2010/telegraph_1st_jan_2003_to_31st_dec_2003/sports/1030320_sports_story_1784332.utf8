Bengal  I live in the present, says Virender Sehwag
SEHWAG: I showed shot-making has a place in Test cricket
  - 'Sourav assesses a player very quickly and, then, gets the best out of him' FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sehwag: 'I showed shot-making has a place in Test cricket' Durban: With just one fifty (66 against Sri Lanka) in nine World Cup matches, its been a disappointing tournament for Virender Sehwag. Yet, he is determined to come good in the semi-finals and, assuming India make the final, in that title-round.Always the quiet sort, Sehwag spoke to The Telegraph at the Holiday Inn Elangeni, Tuesday evening. While his ODI debut was in April 1999, he has been a regular only since March 2001. The following are excerptsOn the past two years, since his comeback in the home (one-day) series versus AustraliaWaise to main khush hoon, but I havent been consistent... Today, Im working towards that... Im told experience helps in getting consistent and, so, the more I play the better my chances. As a person, though, Im the same seedha-sadha Veeru.On whether this lack of consistency is adding to the pressures of international cricketNo, its a personal thing... I want to be consistent, I want to make a bigger contribution... Whether you score or you dont, the pressure remains. International cricket is all about pressure.On the lessons learntThat, cricket-wise, I must be prepared to adjust... That, on the personal front, Ive got to accept spending less and less time at home... That friends ke saath kam time milega.On being out through injuries twice in the last two yearsBut, then, can injuries be avoided? (After a pause) When one gets injured, the effort is towards a quick recovery. Of course, its a big test of mental toughness. On being asked to open, for the first time, during the tri-series in Sri Lanka (July-August 2001)Initially, I did have doubts of my own  would I be able to deliver? Would I be able to adjust? However, I told myself two things: If I was a good batsman, I should have the ability to bat anywhere and, secondly, the captain and coach must have seen something, which made them ask me to open... I backed myself and, as it turned out, scored a crucial 100 against New Zealand. (Adds smiling) The innings taught me that in one-day cricket, its best to open... That you have the advantage of the first 15 overs... That, potentially, you can bat for all 50... On his Test debut (Bloemfontein, November 2001)I was keen to prove a point as a lot of people had begun talking of me as being good for one-day cricket only... Aur, phir, mujhe khud ko dikhana tha ki main Test bhi khel sakta hoon... I went for my shots, something Im most comfortable doing, and showed shot-making has a place in Test cricket.On getting that 105 on debutIll credit my idol, Sachin Tendulkar... That I got the hundred in his presence made it more special... After all, Sachin is the bhagwan of cricket... He kept guiding me... Helped me through the many moments of pressure. [Sachin, too, got a hundred: 155.]On comparisons with SachinI quite enjoy it... In any case, who will mind being compared to the No.1? Mujhe koi takleef nahin hoti hai... Fact is, Im nowhere near Sachin... I just keep trying to learn from him. On whether he has consciously tried to copy any one Sachin shotThe straight drive.On getting to open in Tests too, during last years tour of EnglandIt did require much mental preparation... It required a disciplined approach, required a perfect understanding of the off-stumps location... In a one-dayer, you can get away with a temporary loss in concentration as theres no close-in cordon... You wont find three-four slips and... In Test cricket, though, any lapse is bound to be fatal. Usi innings mein aap phir comeback nahin kar sakte.On, generally, whether he will be comfortable in the middle-orderDekhiye, upar se neeche aane mein koi mushkil nahin hai... It can become difficult if a No.6 is asked to open. But, as Ive said, the best place in ODIs is at the very top.On deciding to play for Leicestershire this summerI didnt want to sit at home for five-six months, thats why I decided to have a taste of County cricket... Im sure there will be plenty to learn, both on and off the field, and (at 24) its the right time to learn. Im aware there will always be pressure to perform, but thats a challenge Im looking forward to...When the County is going to pay well, it will obviously want results...I accept that as the overseas professional, Ill be under more pressure than any other player...(After a pause) Consistency there should help me become consistent in international cricket as well. On specifically opting to head for Grace RoadThats because Leicestershire offered the best terms and facilities. Plus, Leicester has a huge number of Indian expats and, so, support wont ever be lacking. At this moment, however, Im not thinking of County cricket...I live in the present, therefore, my thoughts are on the World Cup.On not being able to capitalise on the many starts in the World CupHasnt frustrated me but, yes, mujhe patient rehna ho ga. Im determined to make a mark in the semi-finals and, God willing, in the final as well. On his interaction with Sandy GordonI didnt have much to ask him. Indeed, I didnt reveal my own expectations...Thats something very personal.On always having Sourav Ganguly and John Wrights backingSuch faith helps the emerging players. Sourav, specially, favours giving youngsters a decent run... Favours giving them opportunities to settle down. My own belief is that he assesses a player very quickly and, then, gets the best out of him.Finally, on what makes Team India tick(Smiles again) The hunger to succeed, the commitment of every single player and the understanding between seniors and juniors. Yeh kabhi nahin hota ki koi naye player ko koi uncomfortable feeling ho ... Its a very happy  Copyright

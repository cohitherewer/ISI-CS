 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore, Nov. 8: The two horses who look best in the 12-horse line-up for the 1,200m Krishnaraja Trophy, tomorrows feature event, are Slanka and Rio Tinto. The former is a three-time winner this summer while Rio Tinto has placed third behind Prince Valiant recently in Mysore. However, going by his good looks and workouts, it is the Rashid Byramji-ward Rio Tinto, with David Badel in the saddle, who is fancied to lift the trophy.

 Bus accident kills 10 Bangla cricketers
 Dhaka: A bus carrying a group of young cricket players to a local tournament veered off the road and plunged into a ditch in southern Bangladesh at dawn Friday, killing 10 players. According to a police official, five other players and officials were injured in the accident in Chittagong city, 216 km south-east of the capital Dhaka. Four players died instantly and six others succumbed to wounds in the state-run Chittagong Medical College Hospital. The players, from the Chittagong-based club Masters Society, were aged between 20 and 22. They are all college students. The team was heading toward Hathazari, an industrial town outside Chittagong, to play in a tournament there. The tournament, scheduled to have started Friday morning, has been called off to mourn the tragedy-struck cricketers.  (AP)  Copyright

 ICC to discuss proposal
New Delhi: A proposal to replace the existing one-day International cricket arrangement with a rolling championship is likely to be taken up at the International Cricket Council meeting starting in London next week. BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya admitted on Monday, the eve of his departure for London, that he did not know much about the unique concept. I must admit I have not been able to understand this new proposal. Does anyone know this matter in detail? Dalmiya said. Australian Cricketers Association chief Tim May had recently proposed to scrap the existing one-day arrangement with a plan where all 11 ODI squads (including Kenya) would play 30 matches each between themselves. This radical plan proposes a team to play against an opposition three times  at home, away and at a neutral venue  making a fixture of 30 matches for each side in a year by the end of which a world champion could be identified.

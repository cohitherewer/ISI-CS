 Notice on Ritesh Yadav
Kanpur: Uttar Pradesh colt Ritesh Yadav, who recently made a sensational allegation, was on Thursday served notice and also asked him to present himself before before a disciplinary committee to prove his stand. An official, Naimuddin Siddiqui said Yadav was not selected in any team or coaching camp so far. He was not included in the list of 75 for the under-19 camp. In the last season, Yadav had played 10 matches in junior division in which he scored only 150 runs, Siddiqui said. In the wake of the Abhijit Kale episode, Yadav charged selectors Gopal Sharma and Shashikant Khandekar with demanding Rs 50,000 for his selection in the U-17 team for Vijay Merchant Trophy three years ago.

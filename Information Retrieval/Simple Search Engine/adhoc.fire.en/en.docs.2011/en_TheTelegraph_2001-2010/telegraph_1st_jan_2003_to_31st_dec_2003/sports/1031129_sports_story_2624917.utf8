 Henry praise for Klusener
Durban: Chairman of South Africas national selection committee Omar Henry said on Friday that allrounder Lance Klusener was too good a cricketer to be thrown away. Henry was speaking regarding Kluseners selection to represent a South African Invitation XI against the Western Province team this weekend and his selection to lead an invitation XI against the West Indians. There have been very positive comments about him coming out of the Kwazulu-Natal dressing room and depending on his performance I certainly think there is a role for him to play for South Africa, Henry said.

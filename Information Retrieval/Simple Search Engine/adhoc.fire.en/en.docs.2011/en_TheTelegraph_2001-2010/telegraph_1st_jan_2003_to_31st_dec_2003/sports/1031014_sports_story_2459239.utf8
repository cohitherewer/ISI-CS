 Cellphone knocks Ponomariov off board
 - Former world champion first player to be penalised under new rule  BY MALCOLM PEIN  Ponomariov  The former world chess champion Ruslan Ponomariov  has become the first player to be disqualified at a major  event for allowing his mobile telephone to ring during a  game.  The 20-year-old Ukrainians telephone sounded during  a match between Ukraine and Sweden at the European Team  Championships held in the Bulgarian city of Plovdiv on Saturday. The Grandmasters disqualification came after he had celebrated his birthday and was presented with gifts by tournament organisers at the start of his game. The identity of the caller was not disclosed but there was speculation it could have been a friend wishing him many happy returns. The beneficiary of Ponomariovs gaffe was Evgeny Agrest, the Swedish Grandmaster, who appeared to be well on the way to victory before his plans were disturbed by the call. Toncho Demirev, from the host nation, immediately disqualified Ponomariov quoting article 13.4 of the Laws of Chess. Mobile telephones are banned in chess tournaments because players could receive advice during the game or even use them to access computer databases of chess moves online. Ponomariov protested, refused to sign the scoresheets on which both players are required to record the moves and result of the game, and slunk off. The match ended in a 2-2 draw. This is the latest setback for the former Fide world champion who was stripped of his title by the games governing body last month after he prolonged contract negotiations for months over a title defence against world No. 1 Garri Kasparov that was scheduled to take place at Yalta. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the Fide president and leader of the Russian republic of Kalmykia, became frustrated with the demands of the players advisers and after two deadlines had been ignored, he cancelled the match.  Ponomariov, slightly built and softly spoken, dresses  in old-style Soviet suits and because of this has been dubbed  Little Karpov after the former Soviet world champion.

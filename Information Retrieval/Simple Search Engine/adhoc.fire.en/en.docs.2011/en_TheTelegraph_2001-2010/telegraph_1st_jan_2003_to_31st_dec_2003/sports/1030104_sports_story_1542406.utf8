		 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 Sasikiran wins in Round VI
																								Hastings: Top seed GM Krishnan Sasikiran defeated sole leader GM Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark in the sixth round of the 65th Hastings International Chess Congress here.																								GM P. Harikrishna was involved in another draw even as GM Alexei Barsov of Uzbekistan put it across WGM Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia to emerge as sole leader with four points from six games he has played so far.																								GM Keith Arkell has a chance of catching up with Barsov in the lead position should he win his sixth round game against GM Vitaly Tshshkovsky of Russia. Arkell fell sick before the start of the game and his postponement request was accepted.																								Sasikiran, along with Harikrishna and Nielsen, shared the second position jointly on 3.5 points followed by Arkell on 3 from five games. English GM Luke McShane and GM Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine shared the next spot on 3 each from six games. 																								The victory ended a winless sequence of Sasikiran and boosted his chances of making it to the top of the table with three more rounds remaining. (PTI)

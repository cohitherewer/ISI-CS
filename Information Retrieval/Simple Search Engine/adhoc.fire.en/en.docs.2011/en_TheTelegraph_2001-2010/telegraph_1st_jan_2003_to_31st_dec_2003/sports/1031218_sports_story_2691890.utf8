 Andy mulled World Cup boycott
 - Armband protester reveals details of unique stand  Andy Flower wearing the black armband during a World Cup game Sydney: Former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower said he considered staging a boycott of the team from the World Cup earlier this year in protest against President Robert Mugabe. Flower told Australias Inside Sport magazine, he decided against a boycott because he felt uncomfortable forcing his beliefs on others. Flower and bowler Henry Olonga created a storm at the tournament when they wore black armbands during Zimbabwes first match against Namibia. The pair released a statement criticising Mugabe, adding, we mourn the death of democracy. Flower and Olonga were told not to wear armbands again, so they donned black wristbands for the next match against India. Both quit international cricket after the World Cup. Flower is playing for South Australia and Olonga is in England. Flower said a former player rang him just before the World Cup to ask him to pull the team out of the tournament, partly held in Zimbabwe. He wanted me to influence the whole team to pull out of the World Cup, Flower said. I seriously tossed the idea around but in the end I told him I couldnt do that. It wasnt up to me to persuade others. They have to do what they think is right. Flower said the participation of Olonga in the protest was important to its success. The most important thing was that a black man had to be involved, Flower said. It would have been pointless if I just did it. It would have been too easy to dismiss it as white imperialist. As soon as I put it to Olonga, he was straight up, it was an amazing reaction. Olonga, writing in Tuesdays edition of Britains The Guardian, said Flower had told him about the idea of a boycott. I thought that was drastic, but we mulled it over for a couple of weeks. A third party thought it would be better for us to make a peaceful protest, to wear a black armband. Olonga said he respected Flower because he had conviction and tremendous integrity. My motivation was that, two years ago, I had been handed a dossier of human rights abuses that have occurred in Zimbabwe, Olonga wrote. Up to that point Id thought Robert Mugabe was a very fair, true, honest president. Olonga said he received threats but did not regret his protest. Did I change the world? Probably not. Did I change Zimbabwe? Probably not, but I played my part. Now Im remembered as the guy who wore a black armband. Flower criticised Zimbabwe coach, Australian Geoff Marsh, and captain Heath Streak, saying he was disappointed at their lack of support. There was a lot of unpleasantness there, Flower said.

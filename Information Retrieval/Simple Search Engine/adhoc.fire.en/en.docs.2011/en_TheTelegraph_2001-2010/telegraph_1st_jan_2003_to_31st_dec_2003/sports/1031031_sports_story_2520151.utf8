The Telegraph - Calcutta
 March start likely: Raja
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Rameez feels the PCB has enough time to put everything in place Mumbai: Team Indias three-Test series in Pakistan, next year, is likely to start in the first week of March. That will be followed by seven ODIs, across that country. As of now, we are looking at the official engagements getting underway in early March...The tour proper, though, will begin in the last week of February, informed Rameez Raja, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive. Speaking to The Telegraph, on Thursday evening, he clarified that the itinerary was yet to be finalised: Only the tentative start and end of tour dates  drawn up many months ago  were communicated to the Board of Control for Cricket in India which, in turn, asked for changes to enable the Indian players get adequate rest after their return from Australia. Team India will be back home around February 12. Rameez, in town for an awards function, added that the PCB will begin working on the itinerary once the chairman, Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia, returns from Barbados. Weve got enough time to put everything in place...the itinerary, marketing and security, he remarked. While the last full-fledged tour was back in 1989-90, Team India figured in three ODIs in late 1997.  Copyright

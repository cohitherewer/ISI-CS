 Vasco player in police custody
Margao: Vasco SC, languishing at the bottom of the table in the current Goa professional league, were dealt a big blow when one of their foreign recruits  Nigerian striker Innocent Umegha  was arrested by police in a fake passport and visa case. Innocent, who was arrested late on Saturday evening under section 468, 471 of IPC and section 14 of Foreigners Act, was produced before Vascos first class judicial magistrate on Sunday. He was remanded to two days in police custody, according to Deputy SP (Vasco) Vishram Borkar. The 18-year-old Nigerian had a forged visa which had already expired in 2002 and was staying in the country illegally for the past one year. Police verified the passport as well as visa of the Nigerian player on Saturday only to find that the documents were fake and forged. (PTI)  Copyright

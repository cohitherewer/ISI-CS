The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangar may replace Bahutule
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT  Bangar  Ahmedabad, Oct. 11:Sanjay  Bangar may replace Sairaj Bahutule for the second Test in  Mohali starting October 16. The selectors will meet on Sunday  after the conclusion of the first Test. Sourav Ganguly had openly pitched for Bangar before the start of this Test. I wasnt there at the selection committee meeting and cant say what happened. But his presence gives you the option of an extra bowler, he had said on the eve of the match. The thinktank feels having three spinners in the squad on the hard and bouncy Mohali track will be a luxury. An extra seamer will always be helpful in such conditions.  Copyright

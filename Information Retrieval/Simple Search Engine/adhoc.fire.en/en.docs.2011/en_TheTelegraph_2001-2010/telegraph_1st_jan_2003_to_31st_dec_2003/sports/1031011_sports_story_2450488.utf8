 Dyer denies involvement 
London: England international footballer Kieron Dyer angrily denied on Friday that he had any involvement in an alleged gang rape attack on a 17-year-old girl which she claims took place in a plush London hotel last month. The denial came as police in London arrested two more men in connection with the alleged rape, reportedly involving several English Premiership footballers. The two men, aged 19 and 22, were later released on bail. British media said the two were believed to be English Premiership footballers but police refused to confirm this. The men were quizzed at a London police station. Dyer, in a statement issued through his lawyers, claimed he had nothing to do with the alleged incident. I had no involvement in this matter let alone being at the centre of it as suggested in e-mails, websites and elsewhere. Until now I have felt trapped and it has been very frustrating that I have been unable to clarify publicly the facts which clearly exonerate me, whilst the police conduct their inquiries, added the 24-year-old.

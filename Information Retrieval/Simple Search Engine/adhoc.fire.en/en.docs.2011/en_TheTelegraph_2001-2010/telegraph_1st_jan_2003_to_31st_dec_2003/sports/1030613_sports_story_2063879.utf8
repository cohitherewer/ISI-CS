The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kaif hits rapid 81
 MoM Mohammed Kaifs knock helped Derbyshire beat Surrey London: Indian batsman Mohammed Kaif, playing only his second county match, smashed an 85-ball 81 to anchor Derbyshire to a 137-run victory over fancied Surrey at Derby Wednesday. Playing an innings of sublime placement, the 22-year-old stole the show and the Man-of-the-Match award as he put Derbyshire on course for a winning total of 271 in 50 overs. In reply, Surrey who fielded nine internationals despite leaving out Alec Stewart and Mark Butcher, were shot out for 134 in 33.4 overs with Graeme Welch claiming four wickets. This was Surreys first defeat in 21 matches since August 2002. On a sluggish pitch he reached his fifty in 68 balls, then accelerated in style against a wayward Surrey attack missing the injured Martin Bicknessl and Alex Tudor. Only Saqlain Mushtaq, with his intelligent off spin, escaped punishment and by the time Kaif swung Adam Hollioake to deep square leg, he had already done his job.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

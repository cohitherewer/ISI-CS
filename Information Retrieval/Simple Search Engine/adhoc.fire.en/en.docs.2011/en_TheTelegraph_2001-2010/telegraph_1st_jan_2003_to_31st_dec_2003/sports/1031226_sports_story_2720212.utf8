The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ may field two spinners
Wellington: Pakistan will take a heavy psychological advantage into the second Test against New Zealand starting on Friday after wrecking the home sides batting in the first match in Hamilton. Mohammed Sami shook New Zealands self-confidence when he scythed through their top and middle order, taking five for 44 before rain stalled the decline on 96 for eight. The match was drawn. The imminent return of Shoaib Akhtar, who missed the Hamilton Test with a calf muscle strain, may only add to the psychological sway Pakistan hold over the Black Caps. Akhtar, working in tandem with Sami, would be a formidable weapon for the tourists, who gained some mental leverage when they dismissed New Zealand for 73 in their last Test meeting here. It was Akhtar, who took six for 11 to undo New Zealand in that match. Samis performance in Hamilton was two-sided. He was a Jekyl in the first innings when he gave up 126 runs and failed to claim a wicket. He was Hyde in the second when he bowled consistently at more than 150 kmph, topped-out 154 kmph and found a length that was almost unplayable. It was largely rain that denied Pakistan the time and opportunity. (AP)  Copyright

				 	 Ganguly: One tour not end of the world																								Auckland: Indias hopes of getting a winning run ahead of the World Cup stand threatened with persistent rains on the eve of the sixth one-day International.																								The visitors broke their dismal losing streak on the tour with a win in the fifth one-dayer at Wellington and were keen to clinch the remaining two. 																								But it has rained ceaselessly over the last few days and the game getting off to a start looks remote. The forecast for Sunday (reserve day) isnt too good either.																								In fact, Hamilton, the venue for the seventh game Tuesday, has also been experiencing heavy rains, and it is a possibility that India have played their last game on tour.																								Though the series loss was the worst preparation, Sourav Ganguly said the team has not lost confidence and will put up a better show in the World Cup.																								Every team passes through such a phase. There are ups and downs in every sport but the important thing is to be able to come back, he said.																								A few Indians had an indoor practice session Friday. Sourav, Rahul Dravid, Sanjay Bangar, Mohammed Kaif and Dinesh Mongia decided to use the indoor nets at Eden Park to work out on their batting.																								Its always hard when you havent scored runs. But one has to keep going because its a matter of just one innings, Sourav said.																								The New Zealanders, on the other hand, are not a fully settled unit, with injuries to a few key players being a serious concern.																								Nathan Astle has been sidelined due to a knee injury while allrounder Jacob Oram is out with a broken finger.																								Despite the wins, the New Zealand batsmen have also not been in the best of form and captain Stephen Fleming admitted that was an area of concern.

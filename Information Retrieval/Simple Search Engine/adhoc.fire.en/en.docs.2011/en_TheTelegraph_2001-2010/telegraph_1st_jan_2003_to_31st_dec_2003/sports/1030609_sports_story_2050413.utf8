The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian golden dream shattered
New Delhi: Iran retained the mens title winning seven gold medals in the Asian Wrestling Championship on Sunday even as Indias bid to win a gold was shattered with both Palwinder Singh Cheema and Kiran Sihag losing their final bouts. Iran clinched three gold medals on the final day as Japan reigned supreme in the womens section, winning three gold medals on Sunday to add to the two gold medals they won on Saturday. Iran tallied 68 points in mens freestyle and 60 in Greco-Roman. In the womens section, Japan finished on top with 65 points. The Indian team secured 54 points in the womens section and 47 in mens freestyle to finish second in both the categories. In the 120kg mens freestyle, Irans two-time Asian champion Rezai Alireja proved too good for Cheema. Cheema failed to win a point against the Iranian and lost the bout by technical fall. Cheema later admitted that he was far behind in preparation as well as fitness level. Sihag lost to Japans Nori Saito after 1 minute and 49 seconds in the womens 67kg category to settle for the silver. In the womens 59kg class, Alka Tomar won a bronze beating Taipeis Hung Yutuning by technical fall. Earlier, Sushil Kumar and Sujit Mann collected two more bronze medals for India. Kumar defeated Jung Yong of South Korea 10-4 to finish third after losing to Mohammed Sayed of Iran earlier in the semi-final of the 60kg mens freestyle. Sujit Mann lost 2-5 in the 74kg mens freestyle semi-final but won his bout for the bronze by default after Kazakhstans Gennadly Laivev failed to turn up. Renu Bala fetched India another bronze in the womens 51kg category. (PTI)  Copyright

 Chandhok in second place
 Chandhok feels his team didnt make full use of the rest day New Delhi: Indias Karun Chandhok finished third in Round 17 and 18 of the British Formula Three (scholarship class) championship at the Thruxton Circuit in Hampshire on Sunday to be in the second place in drivers standings. Chandhok secured a third and second starting position, respectively, for the two races, just two-tenth of a second away from pole in the qualifying sessions, according to information received . In the first session I got caught out with the traffic and was not too happy because I felt we should have been quicker. The second session, though was not too bad but. Unfortunately we couldnt make full use of the test day, said Chandhok, who has six more races left. In the first race, the top three contenders  Steven Kane, Earnesto Viso and Chandhok  kept each other under pressure and just 1.3 seconds separated the three at the chequered flag.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 DSouza to coach Greece
New Delhi: Former Indian hockey coach Cedric DSouza will train Greece as the host nation prepares to grab a berth in the Athens Olympics. The Indian, who will take charge this month, will replace Pancho van den Broek of Holland as the mens and womens team coach to prepare the teams for the qualification matches next March. Greece will play a three-match series with the worlds 12th-ranked teams in mens and womens competition next March, with the winner advancing to the Olympics in Athens. DSouzas second stint as Indian coach ended in chaotic manner when he was fired by the Indian Hockey Federation chief K.P.S. Gill in the middle of the World Cup in Kuala Lumpur last year. That firing itself generated enough controversy with Gill later telling The Telegraph that he had actually asked DSouza to relax purportedly because the next two matches (vs Cuba who India beat 4-0, and versus Poland) were easy.

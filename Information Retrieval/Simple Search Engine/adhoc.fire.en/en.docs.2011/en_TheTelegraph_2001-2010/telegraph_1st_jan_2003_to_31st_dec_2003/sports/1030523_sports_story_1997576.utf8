(Reuters) New Delhi: The Indian challenge at the world table tennis championships being played in Paris came to a tame end when all four paddlers who made it to the main draw bowed out to higher ranked opponents in the first round. According to information received here, Indias top player Chetan Baboor had no answer to the attacking game of Japans Toshio Tasaki, ranked 41st in the world, and was thrashed 6-11, 9-11, 6-11, 8-11 on Wednesday. Young Achanta Sharath Kamal made a promising start against 57th ranked Christophe Legout of France, but the latter overcame early hiccups to win 2-11, 11-6, 11-6, 15-13, 11-6 to advance to the second round. In the womens section, Mouma Das went down fighting to Hungarys Georgina Pota 10-12, 11-9, 9-11, 12-14, 8-11, while Yao Lin Jing of Malaysia defeated Mantu Ghosh 12-10, 11-6, 11-3, 11-5. In the womens doubles, Mouma and Mantu stretched Singapores Xueling Zhang and Paey Fern Tan, but eventually went down 11-8, 7-11, 5-11, 2-11, 11-8, 7-11. Meanwhile, world No.1 Timo Boll suffered a shock 3-11, 7-11, 11-7, 14-12, 11-9, 12-10 second-round defeat to little known Chinese teenager Qui Yike on Wednesday. Asians dominate In a sign of the times Asia accounts for all bar four of the pairings to make it through to the mens and womens doubles quarter finals after early action on Day 4. And as if that was not trouble enough Europe has no representation at all now in the mixed doubles, with the quarter final cast-list comprising six teams from China and two from Korea. Favourites Wang Nan and Zhang Yining dropped the first and fourth sets against the Romanian duo Adriana Nastase and Mihaela Steff before prevailing 4-2 in their third round tie of the womens competition. Chinese No. 2 seeds Niu Jianfeng and Guo Yue lost just the one set against Koreas Kim Kyung-Ha and Jun to win the right to play Russian duo Irina Palina and Svetlana Ganina. The other European pairing still in with a shout are the Hungarians Kristina Toth and Csilla Batorfi who must beat Chinas Li Jia and Li Ju to see the semis. The fourth quarter final pits Singapores Li Jia Wei and Jing Jun Hong against Koreas Suk Eun-Sil and Lee Un-Sil. The Asian domination among the women was mirrored in the mens doubles where again only two European teams made it into the last eight. Top seed Timo Bolls interest in the 47th championships, already seriously dented by his second round defeat in the singles, has ended for good. Playing with Zoltan Fejer-Konnerth the Germans went out 4-1 to defending champions Wang Liqin and Yan Sen who now meet Slobodan Grujic and Alexander Karakasevic of Yugoslavia. The appearance of French great Jean-Michel Gatien alongside another home favourite Patrick Chila next stirred up the Partis an Bercy crowd. But the vocal support was not enough to lift the home pairing past the boys in red at the opposite end of the table  Wang Hao, who made his breakthrough to the senior ranks last year, and Olympic singles gold medallist Kong Linghui, the Chinese fourth seeds. Others with cause to feel on good terms with themselves after the third round were Austrians Werner Schlager and Karl Jindrak, who saw off the Japanese duo Toshio Tasaki and Akira Kito. The remaining quarter final has Koreans Oh Sang-Eun up against Hong Kongs Cheung Yuk and Leung Chu Yun.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

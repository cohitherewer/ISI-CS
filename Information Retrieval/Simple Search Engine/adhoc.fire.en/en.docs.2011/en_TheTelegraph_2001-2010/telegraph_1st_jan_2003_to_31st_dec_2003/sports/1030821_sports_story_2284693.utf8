 Ramesh trying to digest news
Orlando: Leander Paes illness has taken a host of people in the tennis world and elsewhere by surprise. Ramesh reacted in shock, and even the ATP is being cautious. Linda Dozoretz, spokesperson for Navratilova, said Tuesday night the tennis legend had known Paes was unwell because he withdrew from a charity doubles appearance with her. But she said Navratilova had not known the nature of the ailment, reports AFP. Paes and Navratilova last month won the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon, earning her a record-tying 20th championship at the All-England Club. Paes has won 27 mens doubles titles, his triumphs in the 1999 and 2001 French Opens and the 1999 Wimbledon coming with long-time partner Mahesh Bhupathi. Paes, 30, suffered severe headaches during his last match, a first-round loss Thursday at the ATP Western and Southern Financial Group Masters in Mason, Ohio. We are investigating it, said ATP spokesperson Robin Hutchinson. We have nothing to say at the moment. We heard the news but we cannot confirm anything. In Chennai, Ramesh Krishnan, Indian Davis Cup teams non-playing captain said Wednesday he was shocked to hear about Paes, adds PTI. All that I had known from the newspapers is that Paes was suffering from viral fever and that he and Mahesh Bhupathi were forced to withdraw from the ATP Tour event in Long Island, he said. I am shocked to hear the news. Now let us not discuss about Davis Cup or any other events. I am trying to digest the news and recover from the shock. I wish him speedy recovery and then everything will be in place and under control.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

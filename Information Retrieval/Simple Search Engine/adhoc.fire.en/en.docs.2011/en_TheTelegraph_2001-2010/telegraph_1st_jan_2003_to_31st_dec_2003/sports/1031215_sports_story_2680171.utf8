The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan face bankmen
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: A fit-again Rennedy Singh will return to action as Mohun Bagan take on Indian Bank in a fourth-round match of the National Football League at Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. It is a match from which the three-time winners are hoping to collect three points. And considering the strength and records of the teams, it shouldnt be much of a problem for Mohun Bagan. Indian Bank are yet to collect a point, having played three matches so far. Mohun Bagan have four points from three. Captain Rennedy, who missed the last two games against Mahindra and Tollygunge Agragami with a hamstring injury, is yet to regain 100 per cent fitness. But he will play on Monday. Mohun Bagan will miss Jose Ramirez Barreto, who is suspended after receiving two yellow cards.  Payment issue Payment in Mohun Bagan is again causing problems. The players have received nothing over the last three months, and according to the official assigned to look after football by court-appointed Special Officers, fielding a team on Monday is a problem. He put the blame on the club secretary, saying he has not signed the cheque released recently by the sponsors.  Copyright

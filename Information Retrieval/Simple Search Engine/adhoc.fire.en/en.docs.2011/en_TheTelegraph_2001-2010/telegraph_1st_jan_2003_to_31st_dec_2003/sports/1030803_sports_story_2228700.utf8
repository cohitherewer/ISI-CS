 Kunte is champion
 A draw was good enough for Abhijit Kunte Edinburgh, Aug. 2 (PTI): GM Abhijit Kunte won the British chess championship after settling for a draw with GM Joe Gallagher of Switzerland in the 11th round late on Friday. Kunte tallied 8.5 points to finish half-a-point ahead of GM P. Harikrishna, GM Paul Motwani of Scotland and the top seed, GM Vassilios Kotronias of Cyprus. It was the second successive time that an Indian won the meet after IM R. B. Ramesh last year. However, the Indians may not get another chance to play here again as the organisers have decided to bar non-British players. GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly and IM Tejas Bakre finished in the group of eight which tied for the sixth spot with seven points. WGM S. Vijaylakshmi lost to Abdulla al-Rakib of Bangladesh in 39 moves to finish on six points. GM Dibyendu Barua, Surya, IM S. Kidambi all drew their last-round games while Neelotpal Das lost his match.

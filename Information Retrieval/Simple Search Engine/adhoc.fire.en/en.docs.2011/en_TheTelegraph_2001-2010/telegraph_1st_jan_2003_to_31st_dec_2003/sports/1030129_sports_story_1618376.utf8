 BY SAM WALLACE 																								The FA Cup semi-final goal that Ryan Giggs scored against Arsenal in 1999 will always be the standard against which he is judged, so with the champions coming to Old Trafford for the fifth round in March, the winger will need rather more than two goals against West Ham to prove he has returned to form.																								Sir Alex Ferguson announced on Sunday that Giggs was back, although originally it took some time for the United manager to admit publicly that his left-wingers form had gradually ebbed away over Christmas.																								Fergusons assistant, Carlos Queiroz, was the first to admit the clubs disquiet, before Old Trafford cheered the substitution of their famous No 11  who made his debut 12 seasons ago  in the Worthington Cup semi-final first leg.																								It was, perhaps, with that episode in mind that Giggs, the clubs longest-serving player, mentioned the reception he had been given by the home crowd on Sunday. He waited on the bench against Chelsea and has only been re-admitted to the first team in the sides last two games.																								It is always nice to score and it boosts your confidence, and Ive enjoyed the last couple of games, Giggs said. Perhaps I wasnt enjoying my football like I used to a couple of weeks ago, but I certainly enjoyed it today and I have certainly enjoyed the last couple of games.																								I knew that I could come back and play well, it was just a matter of time. Ive had dips in form before but this has probably been my longest dip. The gaffer rested me in a few games recently and that was probably right, especially if you are not playing too well and youve got game after game, you just get no rest.																								He added: Ive played more games this season than in the last four or five years but Ive come back after the rest and felt a lot better and fresher.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

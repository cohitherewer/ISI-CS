 Shoaib signs for Durham
London: Express fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has signed up to play for Durham for the remaining of the county season, it was reported on Sunday. Shoaib will replace South Africas Dewald Pretorius, who has surprisingly been included in the national squad for the upcoming series against England. Durham chairman Bill Midgley and captain Jon Lewis welcomed Shoaibs inclusion to the side. This is excellent news for Durham, said Midgley. Losing Dewald was a big miss for us but signing the first bowler to bowl at 100mph is fantastic  lets see if he can do it at The Riverside and get everyone off their seats! Lewis said he was eagerly looking forward to playing alongside Shoaib. Im delighted Shoaib is joining us. Hes a very exciting prospect, he said. Shoaib was very keen to come here and that is great for Durham. Hes capable of producing devastating spells of fast bowling, Lewis said. (PTI)  Copyright

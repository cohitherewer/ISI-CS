 Bhupathi for youngsters clinic in city
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi will be in the city Monday to attend a clinic at the Salt Lake-based Jaidip Mukerjea Tennis Academy (JMTA). Bhupathi, mens doubles runner-up at Wimbledon with Belarussian Max Mirnyi, will pass on valuable tips to JMTA trainees as well as top juniors from other clubs. Those attending the three-hour session wont have to pay any fees. The Davis Cup star, who has seven Grand Slam titles  three in mens doubles, three in mixed  under his belt, has agreed to be present at three more similar clinics in the state this year. Bhupathis visit to the city comes at a time when Indian tennis is riding high on Wimbledon success. Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova lifted the mixed doubles trophy and Sania Mirza became the first Indian female to clinch a crown at the grasscourt Grand Slam when she won the girls doubles with Russian Alisa Kleybanova.

 Paes recovery on track
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Sept. 20: The cyst in Leander Paes brain has subsided by 50 per cent, according to Fridays MRI report. That was exactly what the tennis star was looking forward to, in his quest to get back on court by the end of October. It should regress totally in six weeks time, said Dr Vece Paes who returned from Orlando on Friday. A decision on when he will resume practising tennis will be taken after consultation with Dr B.S. Singhal once Leander returns to Mumbai next week.  Copyright

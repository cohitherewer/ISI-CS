The Telegraph - Calcutta
 6th straight win for CESC
 - CPT net a round dozen BY A STAFF REPORTER Action from the  BHA first division group A league match between CESC  and CCFC Thursday. CESC won 3-1. Picture by Santosh  Ghosh  Calcutta: Defending champions  CESC beat CCFC 3-1 in a BHA League first division group  A match Thursday for their sixth win in as many matches.  Calcutta Port Trust hammered Howrah Union 12-0 in another  match. After a barren first half CESC  took the lead in the 45th minute when Christopher Thomas  converted a penalty stroke with a crisp hit which gave the  custodian no chance. Atal Tirkey capped a fine move  with a reverse flick for the second goal, 13 minutes later. Just as it seemed CESC had the  match in their pocket, Roshan Minz of CCFC took full advantage  of some slack marking and reduced the deficit to one goal. After some more anxious moments  in the rear, CESC rounded off the tally three minutes from  time. Lalit Singh did the spadework  by dribbling past a clutch of CCFC defenders and his neat  stickwork found an unmarked Anil Ekka inside the D. Ekka  didnt err.  CESC and Calcutta Customs both  have 18 points from six outings. CCFC have seven after six. In a deluge of goals in the other  match, Surajit Patra scored three and Manoj Das two for  Port Trust against a hapless Howrah Union. Prabhu Soy Herenz, Rajesh Mishra,  Nelson Herenz, Rajiv Panth, Yusuf Bhengra, Prakash Toppo  and Mrinal Chakraborty got one each. Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shoaib to target all XI tomorrow
 The surface doesnt matter  as Im so quick in the air... FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Shoaib: I love  bowling in pressure games  Pretoria: Shoaib Akhtar, the  worlds No. 1 speed merchant, has vowed to target the  entire Indian team during Saturdays World Cup derby in  neighbouring Centurion. Speaking in Rantjiesfontein  (a 35-minute drive away) after the Pakistan teams workout  Thursday afternoon, Akhtar warned: All of us have to give  our best and, personally, Ill be looking to target all  XI Indians... Weve got to win  we dont have an option.  So, Ill be going all out. Talking with a recently acquired  accent, Akhtar added: Theres a lot of hype and the intensity  of an Indo-Pak match is always high... Yes, there will be  pressure, but I thrive in such conditions... I love to bowl  in the pressure games. God knows what the result will be,  but it surely will be a good match. In any case, its easier bowling  to the Indians if a comparison is made, say, with Australia... Asked whether the SuperSport Park  wicket would give him an advantage, Akhtar replied with  the confidence of a champion. For me, the surface doesnt  matter because Im so quick in the air... Of course, help  from the wicket  be it pace or bounce  is going to be  welcomed. My job will be easier if conditions help swing. In Akhtars opinion, if the toss  is won by Pakistan, then Waqar Younis should set a target.  The bowling is our strength, so, we should get the runs  on board and then bowl out India... Will it only be a Shoaib  Akhtar versus Sachin Tendulkar battle? No... Hes the best  batsman, but India have Rahul Dravid as well... If you ask  me, I like bowling to the biggest names, though. Having only recently clocked the  fastest delivery ever (161.3 kmph, at Newlands, against  England), Akhtar insisted a five-wicket haul would give  more satisfaction than breaking the 100 mph barrier. Im  actually quite disappointed that I went for 63 from nine  overs in that game. Clearly, Akhtar indicated being  hailed as speed merchant No. 1 didnt exactly mean too much.  And, speaking about his form in the World Cup, he candidly  accepted he expected more than ten wickets in the four  matches till date. Thats not enough, but Im happy with  the rhythm. Its not that Ive struggled. Having just emerged as the highest  scorer (43, versus England) in the No. 11 position in any  ODI, Akhtar quipped: Nowadays, when I wake up, I begin  looking for the bat... Ive been consciously trying to improve  my batting, because a 25-30 from somebody in the tail could  lift a team to 270-280, which will be more than competitive  batting first... Asked by The Telegraph  whether he continued to unwind by watching Bollywood movies  and listening to the latest chartbusters from India, Akhtar  enthusiastically answered: Jee haan ... Aap ne theek  farmaya... While Kaante is the last movie I have  seen, I thoroughly enjoyed Dil Chahta Hai... Everything  about it is so nice. Now, will he be a little nice  to the Indians? Meanwhile, the Indians arrived  from Durban late this evening. Unlike the last India visit  here, for the Australia game, when both were in the same  hotel, the Pakistanis will be shuttling from Johannesburg.  Apparently, security considerations came into play.

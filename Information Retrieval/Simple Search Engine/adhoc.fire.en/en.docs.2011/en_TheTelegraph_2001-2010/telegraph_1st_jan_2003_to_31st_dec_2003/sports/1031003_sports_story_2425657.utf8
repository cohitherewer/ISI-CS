 Hollioake to quit after next season
London: Surrey captain Adam Hollioake is to retire from first-class cricket at the end of the 2004 English season, the club announced on Tuesday. But there was better news for the Oval-based county when, in a separate statement, they said England batsman and Surrey favourite Graham Thorpe had signed a new two-year contract. Hollioake, 32, a medium-pace bowling allrounder who won four Test caps and made 35 one-day International appearances for England between 1996 to 1999, including 14 as captain, has been profoundly affected by the death of his younger brother. Ben Hollioake, himself a Surrey and England allrounder, died aged 24 in a car accident in Perth in march 2002. Adam, who will set off on a charity expedition on Thursday on behalf of the Ben Hollioake fund, said: I have had a marvellous 14 years at Surrey  and in the last seven years as captain, I feel we have achieved many things of which I am immensely proud. After much soul searching I have decided that 2004 will be my final year. I have many things that I want to do with my family, charity work with the Ben Hollioake fund and my business interests in Perth. (AFP)  Copyright

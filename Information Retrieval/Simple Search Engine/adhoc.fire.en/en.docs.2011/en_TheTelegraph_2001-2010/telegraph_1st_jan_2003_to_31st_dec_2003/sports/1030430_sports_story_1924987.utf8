The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pollock, Hayden among best
London: Shaun Pollock, South Africas sacked captain, and Nasser Hussain, who stood down as Englands one-day skipper after a disappointing World Cup campaign, have been included in Wisdens five Cricketers of the Year. The 140th edition of the Cricketers Almanack conceded that their selection might cause surprise. But Wisden editor Tim de Lisle argued: The choice of Hussain and Pollock may raise eyebrows, as both led national teams to heavy defeats in Australia but, if we ruled out players who get hammered by the Australians, we wouldnt have many left. De Lisle said Hussains leadership skills had made him Englands most influential figure in a generation while Pollock remained one of the worlds top two seamers, as well as a stylish batsman. Wisdens other choices as Cricketers of the Year  Michael Vaughan, Matthew Hayden and Adam Hollioake  were less controversial. England opener Vaughan was the worlds leading run-scorer in 2002. He has made seven centuries in his last 12 Tests. Australian Matthew Hayden averages 51.66 in Tests, 43.13 in one-dayers and made 686 runs in six Test innings towards the end of last year against Pakistan and England. Adam Hollioake, won his award after leading Surrey to their third English County championship title in four years. His brother Ben passed away in car crash in Australia last year.

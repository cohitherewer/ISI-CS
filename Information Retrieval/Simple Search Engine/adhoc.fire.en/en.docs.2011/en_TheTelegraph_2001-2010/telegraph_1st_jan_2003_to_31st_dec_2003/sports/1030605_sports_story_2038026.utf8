The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wasim Akram wants India for last supper
Karachi: Responding positively to a PCB offer for a farewell appearance, fast bowler Wasim Akram expressed his wish for one final fling against arch rivals India. Its a nice gesture on the part of PCB that they have plans to give me a farewell one-dayer before the home crowd, he said from Hampshire where he is playing County cricket. The PCB chairman Tauqir Zia has said the board is planning a fitting farewell for Akram by fielding him in a one-day game against South Africa in October. It would be a dream come true if I get one chance against India in Pakistan, Akram said. 25% pay hike  Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta adds: Meanwhile, the PCB has decided on a 25% pay increase. According to The Telegraphs sources, this will come into effect from the forthcoming tour of England. As regards coach Javed Miandads contract, the formal signing should take place in the very near future. In fact, it could even be done as early as Thursday.  (AFP)  Copyright

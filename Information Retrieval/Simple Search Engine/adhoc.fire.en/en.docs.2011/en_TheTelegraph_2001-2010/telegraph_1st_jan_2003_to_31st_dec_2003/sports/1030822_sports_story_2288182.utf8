 Barrichello, Raikkonen may be blamed 
Budapest: German Grand Prix stewards will meet Rubens Barrichello and Kimi Raikkonen in Budapest on Friday to discuss new evidence of the first corner crash at Hockenheim three weeks ago. Ferraris Barrichello and McLaren driver Kimi Raikkonen were eliminated from the German race after colliding with Williams Ralf Schumacher at the opening corner. Schumacher was initially blamed and handed a penalty of losing 10-grid positions for the Hungaroring, only to have the punishment lessened after an appeal to a $50,000 fine. New evidence provided by Peter Wright, the FIAs technical and safety consultant, claims that Ferraris Barrichello and McLaren driver Kimi Raikkonen could be blamed in part. They will meet with stewards at the Hungaroring on Friday to discuss the new evidence, the sports governing body the FIA said in a statement. Meanwhile, Ralf said he was relieved about not losing places on the starting grid at the Hungarian Grand Prix. I am happy the decision went that way. Losing 10 places would obviously have made the race difficult, as it is known Hungary does not allow much opportunity for overtaking, Ralf said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

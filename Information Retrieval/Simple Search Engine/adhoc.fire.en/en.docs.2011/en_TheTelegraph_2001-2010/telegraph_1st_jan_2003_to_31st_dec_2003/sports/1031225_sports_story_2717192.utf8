 Garrison new Fed Cup captain
White Plains: Zina Garrison was named captain of the US Fed Cup team on Wednesday in place of the outgoing Billie Jean King. Garrison, a three-times Grand Slam champion and Wimbledon finalist, will become the first African-American skipper in the Fed Cups 40-year history when she makes her debut next April against Slovenia in a World Group first round tie. Im thrilled to be selected captain of the US Fed Cup team and am ready for the pursuit of a championship, having learned so much from my mentor Billie Jean King, said Garrison, winner of three Fed Cup titles between 1984 and 1994. Leading the effort in representing our country in Fed Cup is a great responsibility and an opportunity for which I am very grateful. I am looking forward to the challenge. As a player, Garrison won 37 titles  14 singles, 20 doubles and three mixed doubles  during a 15-year career which ended in 1997. Garrison, a perennial top-10 player from 1983-1990, climbed to a career-high four in the world rankings before she retired from the game. She won Grand Slam mixed doubles titles with fellow American Sherwood Stewart at the Australian Open in 1987 and at Wimbledon in 1988, and also with Rick Leach at Wimbledon in 1990. King, who will stay on as the US Fed Cup team coach, steps down after a successful and often turbulent run as US captain.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Surya Sekhar in sole lead
	 - WORLD JUNIOR CHESS  Surya Sekhars aggression versus Mastrovasilis paid off Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan): Indias Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly moved into sole lead after the third round of the World Junior Chess Championship here after outplaying Dmitros Mastrovasilis of Greece. He now has 3 points in his kitty. A pack of five, on 2.5 points apiece, are breathing down Gangulys neck. They are compatriot P. Magesh Chandran, Alexander Zubov of Ukraine, Marcin Dziuba of Poland, Kritz Leonid of Germany and Rustem Sadykov of Kazakhstan. In the girls championship, Indias youngest Women International Master Dronavalli Harika continued with her winning ways and was in joint lead with four others after the second round. She defeated Martina Valickova of the Czech Republic. Asian junior champion Tania Sachdev moved to joint sixth on 1.5 points after bouncing back with a win over Margiz Unudova of Azerbaijan. She had drawn her first game. Playing white, Surya Sekhar aggression was justly rewarded. The bronze medallist of the previous edition faced the Sicilian Taimanov by Mastrovasilis. An exponent of the opening himself, Surya Sekhar was in for a surprise in the middle game as Mastrovasilis kept his king in the centre and pushed his king bishop pawn that left irreparable weaknesses in his position. Going for the kill on the 27th move, Surya Sekhar ripped apart the Greeks defences and forced resignation five moves later. Earlier, in the second round, International Master Magesh Chandran registered a thumping victory over top seed Grandmaster Shahriyaz Mamdyarov of Azerbaijan National junior champion Abhijit Gupta was the other Indian to taste success as he scalped fourth seed compatriot Grandmaster P. Hari Krishna in the second round.  (PTI)  Copyright

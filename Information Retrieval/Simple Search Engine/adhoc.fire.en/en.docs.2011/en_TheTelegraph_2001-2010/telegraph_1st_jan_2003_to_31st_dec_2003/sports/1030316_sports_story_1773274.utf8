The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A conclave to improve rapport
Durban: In a bid to sort out the differences between them, top administrators of world cricket will get together at Robben Island on Monday hoping to join hands for the development of the game. The trip to Robben Island, a masterstroke on the part of 2003 World Cup organising committee chief Ali Bacher, will see BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya and ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed and president Malcolm Gray, among others, get together in a congenial atmosphere rather than face each other across boardrooms of intense cricket politics. Over 100 chief executives and presidents of the various cricket boards and associate countries will get together in an informal manner and we cant escape the conclusion there is an attempt to improve personal rapport, said Bacher.

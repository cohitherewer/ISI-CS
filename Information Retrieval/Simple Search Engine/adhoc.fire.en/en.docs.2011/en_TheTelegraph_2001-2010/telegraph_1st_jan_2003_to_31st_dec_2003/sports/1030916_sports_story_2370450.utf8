 Stewart quits all forms
London: Former England wicketkeeper Alec Stewart has retired from first-class cricket a week after playing his last match for England, his county side Surrey said on Monday. Stewart, 40, ended his international career in the final Test against South Africa in London earlier this month. He had played for Surrey for 22 years and scored 26,165 runs at an average of 40.06 in 447 first class matches, Surrey said on their website. Surreys chief executive Paul Sheldon said Stewart would be remembered as the countys greatest player of modern times.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

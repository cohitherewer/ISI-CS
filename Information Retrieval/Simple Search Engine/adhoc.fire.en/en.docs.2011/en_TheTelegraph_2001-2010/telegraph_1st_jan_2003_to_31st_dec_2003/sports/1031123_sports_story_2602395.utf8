 Kanetkar retires in Round II
New Delhi, Nov. 22 (PTI): Nikhil Kanetkars hopes of bagging another international title crashed when he retired from his second-round match at the Scottish meet being held in Glasgow. According to information received here, Kanetkar conceded the match to Welshman Irwansyah while trailing 15-11 8-15 1-8 last night. Kanetkar won his maiden international crown in Cahors, southern France, last week. In the first round, the Indian southpaw  runner-up at this grade A tournament in 2001  was made to sweat by local qualifier Bruce Flockhart before coming through 15-10, 8-15, 15-6. Chetan Anand bowed out in the first round itself. He was no match for Bjoern Joppien of Germany and lost 6-15, 9-15.  Copyright

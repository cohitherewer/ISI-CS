The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I blocked ICC move: Zia
Islamabad: Praising Bangladesh for their gutsy performance in the on-going Test series, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia said he had firmly opposed an ICC move to withdraw the minnows Test status. I made them (ICC members) realise in the meeting, held in Monte Carlo, that withdrawal of Bangladeshs Test status would not help any cause. They can prove themselves in future and today they seem to be a far more improved side than ever before, he said in Karachi on Friday.  (PTI)  Copyright

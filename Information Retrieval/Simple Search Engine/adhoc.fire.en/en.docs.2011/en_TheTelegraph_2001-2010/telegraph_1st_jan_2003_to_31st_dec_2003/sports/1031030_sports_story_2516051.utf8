 Five-gold haul boosts India tally
 Frankie Fredericks looks at the timings after winning the 200m gold in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (AFP) Hyderabad: Star shooter Anjali Bhagwat and long jumper Anju Bobby George excelled as India claimed five gold medals on Day 5 of the Afro-Asian Games to climb to fourth position on the medals table on Wednesday. The athletes won a bulk of the medals  eight, including three golds  while the shooters captured two gold and two bronze medals on a highly rewarding day for the hosts. India now have eight gold, 21 silver and 21 bronze medals. China stayed on top with a tally of 17-6-3. South Africa were second with 12-11-13 followed by Japan on 9-3-1. Indias best day also witnessed former world champion and veteran sprinter Frankie Fredericks in action. The Namibian won the mens 200m gold in 20.57 seconds and anchored his team to gold in the 4x100m relay. India not only had the most satisfying day since the Games began but also assured themselves of a few more medals with the tennis players including Mahesh Bhupathi, pugilists and the mens football team moving into the finals. Anju, who recently won a bronze medal in the world championship in Paris, stole the limelight by clinching gold with an effort of 6.53m. J.J. Shobha in heptathlon and Anil Kumar in discus won the other gold medals.  Saraswati second Saraswati Saha (200m), Jasmine Kaur (10,000m walk) and Arun DSouza (3000m steeplechase) won silver medals. Soma Biswas (heptathlon), Jagdish Bishnoi (javelin) and the mens 4x100 relay team of C.T. Durai, Sandeep Sarkaria, Piyush Kumar and Sanjay Ghosh won bronze. The shooting range also proved productive for India as Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Anjali won gold medals. Rathore tallied 174 points in mens double trap and teammate Ranjan Sodhi clinched the silver with 167. Anjali, who won the silver in womens 10m air rifle on Tuesday, won her first gold medal of the Games in the 50m rifle 3-position event with a total of 675.5 points. Kuheli Ganguly got the bronze with 669.7. India have so far won three gold, six silver and two bronze medals in shooting. Anjali, in second spot after the qualifying stage due to a poor kneeling round, found her rhythm in the final and scored 98.5 points. The silver went to Olga Dovgun of Kazakhstan. Rathore was confident personified on his way to gold. He led the field of six, including three Indians, throughout. M. Nicholson of Zimbabwe won the bronze medal. Asian Games champion Tan Zongliang of China won the mens 10m air pistol event with 693.8 points. Francois van Tonder (674.4) of South Africa won the silver and Namibias Friedhelm Sack (673.1) the bronze. Things were not as good in swimming as Senthil Kumar won Indias lone medal, a bronze. Richa Mishra and Nisha Millet finished fourth in their respective events. Kumar finished a distant third in 100m backstroke at 1:02.04. Kumars bronze took Indias medal haul from swimming to 16 with seven silver and nine bronze medals. Japan are way ahead with nine gold, three silver and one bronze medal. Richa came close to a bronze in womens 100m butterfly, but lost out to Luisa Gavazzi over the last 30 metres. Nisha suffered the same fate in 100m backstroke as she squandered an early lead. Indians performed poorly in the other events. Akbar Ali Mir (mens 100m butterfly), Deepak Singh (mens 50m backstroke) and D. Mridula (womens 50m backstroke) all finished fifth. There wasnt much to cheer for India in weightlifting too as one bronze was all that they got. P. Harita got the medal in the womens 63kg category, which had just three competitors.  (PTI)  Copyright

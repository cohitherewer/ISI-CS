 Newcastle promise more quality 
Newcastle: Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson will be able to strengthen his squad for next season with more top-class players, club chairman Freddy Shepherd has promised. The St James Park club are already thinking about a second successive Champions League campaign after securing a qualifying slot via their third place in the Premier League behind champions Manchester United and Arsenal. Weve signed Hugo Viana, Jonathan Woodgate and Laurent Robert in the last two years and there will be more top-class players coming here, Shepherd was quoted as saying in The Journal newspaper in Newcastle on Tuesday. Any player worth his salt would want to join Newcastle and Im talking about players across Europe. Weve got a fine reputation now. We wont panic in the transfer market and we wont gamble either. Theres no need. Its all about topping and tailing a quality squad. Theres already quality in every department, and good cover too, but Newcastle United wont stand still. If we believe someone can improve this squad then well try to get him. I wont mention figures but were probably only one of a handful of clubs with the resources to go out and strengthen our squad. No manager has ever left this club complaining the board deprived him of funds. That will continue.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Norman fears golf has gone flat
 Greg Norman at Royal St Georges on Tuesday. (Reuters) Sandwich: Greg Norman, at 48 one of the grand old men of golf, returned to the scene of his 1993 British Open triumph on Tuesday to bemoan the lack of characters in the modern game. The Australian has undergone hip, shoulder and back surgery through the strain of hitting, he estimates, around four million balls in his career. He has played only three tournaments so far this year. Norman remains a keen observer of the sport although he fears it has gone flat for a number of factors including a lack of charisma among the younger players. Over the broad sweep it seems that they are pretty much the same, he said. Theyre all fit and have all the psychology but you dont see a Craig Stadler out there  he had charisma, hed kick his clubs and when he played you had a reaction. Most of the younger players seem like theyre very stoic in their approach. When I played and Seve (Ballesteros), we had a bit of flair, wore our hearts on our sleeve and I think thats missing in a lot of them. Thats why it was so good to see Sergio Garcia come out of that group of players with that flair too. I dont care whether hes Spanish, Australian or whatever, people want to see guys like him play. Few could accuse Norman of lacking charisma in a 27-year career which has reaped 86 titles worldwide including two British Open titles in 1986 at Turnberry and Royal St Georges the last time it was played here in 1993. He is also remembered for some spectacular near-misses including his US Masters nightmare of 1996 when he surrendered a six-shot lead on the last day to allow an inspired Nick Faldo to claim his third green jacket. Norman regrets little, though, and remains among the highest earning golfers thanks to a string of business interests including a burgeoning golf course design company. I do wish that Id started working out earlier in my career  like Gary Player has done  because that way I could have avoided some more of the problems that kick in when youre around 45, he said. Norman estimated he would play a maximum of 12 tournaments a year and then six or so when he turned 50 in two years. Because of this lack of competitive play this year, Norman does not rate his chances of winning again this week and he is not impressed with a couple of tweaks to lengthen the course since he last played at Royal St Georges. He has had two steroid injections to enable him to play but said it never occurred to him to pull out.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

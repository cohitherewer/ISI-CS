The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No mixed feelings vs India: Patil
Weve achieved what we set out to do, says Kenya coach
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Patil Pretoria: Two decades ago, Sandeep Patil was a member of Indias World Cup-winning side. Now, as Kenyas coach, he will be plotting his adopted teams Super Six strategy against India.No, there wont be mixed feelings... As a professional, Ill have to give my best shot. However, Indias strength is all too well known, Patil told The Telegraph, when contacted in Kimberley Sunday afternoon.Overjoyed at Kenyas qualification, Patil added: Weve achieved what we set out to do. In fact, on arriving in South Africa, we made the point about aiming to make the Super Six. Weve been successful.Patil, of course, is looking ahead realistically. Well do our best, that goes without saying, but are aware that weve made it thanks to New Zealand forfeiting four points and the West Indies losing two (to Bangladesh) in a rain-marred game... We will be positive and Im hoping our batsmen will be consistent.Kenyas last match, versus the West Indies, is in Kimberley Tuesday.Meanwhile, much against expectations, Pool B has become the Group of Death. So far, only the Kenyans have moved to the next stage. For the two berths that remain, multiple calculations can come into play.The possibilities are: a) If Canada beat New Zealand, South Africa beat Sri Lanka and Kenya beat the West Indies. Then, Kenya will be No.1 (20 points), South Africa No.2 (16 points) and Sri Lanka No. 3 (16 points).b) If Canada beat New Zealand, South Africa beat Sri Lanka and the West Indies beat Kenya. Then, South Africa will be No.1 (16 points), Kenya No.2 (16 points) and Sri Lanka No. 3 (16 points).c) If Canada beat New Zealand, Sri Lanka beat South Africa and Kenya beat the West Indies. Then, Kenya will be No.1 (20 points), Sri Lanka No.2 (20 points), and New Zealand No. 3 (12 points). South Africa, also on 12, will be eliminated on account of losing to New Zealand.d) If Canada beat New Zealand, Sri Lanka beat South Africa and the West Indies beat Kenya. Then, Sri Lanka will finish No.1 (20 points), Kenya No. 2 (16 points) and the West Indies No. 3 (14 points).e) If New Zealand beat Canada, South Africa beat Sri Lanka and Kenya beat the West Indies. Then, Kenya will finish No.1 (20 points) with the NRR determining which of the two  South Africa, Sri Lanka and New Zealand  will complete the qualification.f) If New Zealand beat Canada, South Africa beat Sri Lanka and the West Indies beat Kenya. Then, South Africa and Kenya, with 16 points apiece, will take position Nos.1 and 2 (to be determined by the NRR) with either Sri Lanka or New Zealand, 16 points each, finishing No.3 (again, to be determined by the NRR).g) If New Zealand beat Canada, Sri Lanka beat South Africa and Kenya beat the West Indies. Then, Kenya will finish No.1 (20 points), Sri Lanka No.2 (20 points) and New Zealand No.3 (16 points).h) If New Zealand beat Canada, Sri Lanka beat South Africa and the West Indies beat Kenya. Then, Sri Lanka will finish No.1 (20 points), Kenya No.2 (16 points) and New Zealand No.3 (16 points).Incidentally, the Event Technical Committee (of the World Cup), which met Saturday evening, threw out applications forwarded by Sri Lanka and Kenya. The Sri Lankans, though, have lodged an appeal. Obviously, they are not satisfied with the interpretation of one of the clauses  Copyright

 Holland retain title with 4-2 win 
 Holland captain Jeroen Delmee with the trophy in Amstelveen on Sunday. (AP) Amstelveen: Riding a rare combination of individual brilliance and teamwork, Holland overcame Australia 4-2 in the final to retain the title in the 25th Champions Trophy at the Wagener Stadium on Sunday. It was the seventh title for the Dutch, who performed consistently throughout the week-long tournament. For the Aussies, who had lost 3-5 to the Dutch in the league, a second-place finish was some consolation following their lacklustre show at the Cologne edition last year where they finished fifth. Matthijs Brouwer (20th), Ronald Brouwer (29th), Teun de Nooijer (62nd) and Karel Klaver (66th) ensured a Dutch triumph, while Craig Victory (29th) and Troy Elder (60th) kept the Aussies in the hunt. The teams sizzled with pace and power in the first-half that had plenty of goalmouth action to keep the 8,000 capacity crowd on the edge of their seats. The Dutch looked the better organised team with De Nooijer, as always, initiating the team attacks. However, the Dutch kept a sharp eye on the Aussies who were quick to pounce on the smallest of openings. The Australians had to contend with tight marking and a solid deep defence which gave nothing away. Thus, they were made to toil as the Dutch seemed to read their setplays.

 Barua rewrites record books
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 1: GM Dibyendu Barua rewrote the history books on Saturday when he took on 136 budding chess players of The Future Foundation School in a simultaneous exhibition match at their school premises. This was the highest number played by an Indian GM in a simultaneous match. Barua took nearly five hours for the exhibition and won 126 games while he drew seven and lost three. During the course of the marathon Barua walked nearly 12km to play the games. But even five hours were insufficient to complete all games. The unfinished games were later adjudicated by the coaches and officials of Alekhine Chess Club. After the game an exhausted Barua said: The most difficult part was to walk such a long distance. But some of the students really posed tough problems. Vijayalakshmi Dubey, Soham Nag and Shataneek Guha beat the GM.  Chanda title confirmed PTI adds from Delhi: Sandipan Chanda has been awarded the GM title, according to AICF president P.T. Ummerkoya, who is currently attending a Fide meeting in Greece. Sandipan completed his final GM norm in Spain a few months earlier. Hehas subsequently reached the required Elo rating amrk of 2500 and his current rating is 2504. He has thus officially become Indias ninth GM.  Copyright

		 Saturday, November 08, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Sydney: Australian Test captain Steve Waugh bludgeoned 117 not out to lead New South Wales to a thrilling five-wicket win over Western Australia at Sydney Cricket Ground here on Friday. Chasing 303 from 52 overs, the reigning Shield champions reached their target with 4.4 overs and five wickets to spare as they thrashed 303 for five wickets on an enthralling final day. 				 																																	The match had been brought back to life by Western Australian captain Justin Langer when he closed his teams second innings with 362 for eight wickets. Waugh was wonderfully supported by Test left-hander Simon Katich (71 not out from 45 balls) and Phil Jaques (43 from 35).				 																																	Pushkar: His trademark reverse flick has given India many memorable victories in the recent past and also won him numerous followers in the hockey world. But star forward Gagan Ajit Singh confessed that luck has played an important role in his tremendous success with the most unpredictable shot.				 																																	No matter how much one practises the shot during training, no one can confidently say that he can score at will from a reverse flick. It is the most unpredictable shot in hockey. Neither the person hitting it nor the opponent goalkeeper can predict as to where the ball will end up, he said.				 																																	Houston: Kenny Perry may be out of the running for PGA Tour player of the year honours but he believes his is the 2003 feel-good story for the over-40s. The 43-year-old American says he has no idea why he has won three times this season, including back-to-back titles in the Colonial and the Memorial.				 																																	Why after 17 years (on the tour), why has this year been so magical? I dont know, Perry said after firing a four-under-par 67 to share the first-round lead with Charles Howell III at the season-ending Tour Championship on Thursday. Im probably the more feel-good story of the year for the over-40 clan.				 																																	Paris: Mary Pierce will team up with Amelie Mauresmo for the first time for France in the Fed Cup semi-finals against Russia later this month. Pierce, plagued by injury since winning the French Open in 2000, has not represented her country in the Fed Cup since the 1997 final when France beat the Netherlands 4-1 in Den Bosch. Mauresmo first played for France in 1998. Pierce is ranked 33rd, three below Nathalie Dechy who has a wrist injury and is not included in the team.				 																																	Stephanie Cohen-Aloro and Emilie Loit make up the team, the French Tennis Federation said on Friday.				 																																	Las Vegas: Roy Jones Jr returns to the ring for the first since lifting the world heavyweight title in March when he takes on WBC and IBF light-heavyweight champion Antonio Tarver at Mandalay Bay on Saturday. After securing his place among boxings all-time greats, Jones steps down a division this weekend.				 																																	Im telling you, it was fun challenging myself, Jones said. From 199 (pounds) to make 175, Im mad as hell. So, Ill see you all come Saturday night.				 																																	Jerusalem: Maccabi Tel Avivs ousted midfielder Avi Nimni issued a 22 million shekel (about $5 million) lawsuit against his club on Thursday. The suit was issued on Nimnis behalf at the  Israeli FAs arbitration panel. The player claims he has  not received his salary for three months and that Maccabi  are not living up to their contractual commitments.

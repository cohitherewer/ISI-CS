		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Australia, England want to wreck Cup
																								Johannesburg: South African sports minister Ngconde Balfour has branded the British and Australian governments hypocrites for opposing 2003 World Cup matches scheduled in Zimbabwe.																								England and Australia are under pressure from their governments not to honour the fixtures on moral grounds. Surely that is hypocritical and wrong, Balfour said Monday.																								When the Zimbabwean team went to the Manchester Commonwealth Games, I dont remember Mr (Tony) Blair telling them to pack up and go home. Those two countries want to wreck our World Cup in South Africa, the minister alleged. 																								 (Reuters)

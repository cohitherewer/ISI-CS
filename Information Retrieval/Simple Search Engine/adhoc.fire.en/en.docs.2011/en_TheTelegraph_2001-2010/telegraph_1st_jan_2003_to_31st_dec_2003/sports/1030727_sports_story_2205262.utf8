 Salgaocar tear bankmen apart 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 26: Salgaocar decided to follow in the footsteps of the raingods, they were merciless on Saturday. Playing flawless football, the Goan outfit tore apart Indian Bank  scoring a 4-0 win en route to setting up a Tata Federation Cup quarter final clash with Mohammedan Sporting. Climax Lawrence netted twice, the second through a spot kick, while Dharamjit Singh and Samson Singh chipped in between. Indian Bank clearly has no experience of playing under such soggy conditions and they surely showed no effort to adapt. As their coach V. Sathyan put it, they were far superior. Their opponents, on the other hand, showed plenty of purpose  the scoreline the true reflection of the quality of football Salgaocar put on display at the Salt Lake Stadium. The Goans went into the lead in the 15th minute when Lawrence delicately diverted a goalbound shot from Sebastiao Endro. As Endro took a blinding shot at goal off a Tomba Singh corner, an unmarked Lawrence poaching at the goalmouth neatly touched it into the left corner of the netting. Tomba, nothing less than a livewire in the midfield, produced most of Salgaocars runs and was ably supported by Belo Rezaq and Dharamjit Singh. Endro was again in the centre of action when he played a deft one-two with Dharamjit with the latter slotting in with a right footer. Salgaocar were two up in the 23rd minute. Salgaocar were not content, their play showed their mission was not accomplished, there were more goals to score. Tomba was now in good rhythm, setting up the third. It needed another searing Tomba run down the left, an accurate cross and a diving header from Samson and Salgaocar had sealed the match. Salgaocar began the second half in the same frame of mind. In fact, they played even superior football. After a few missed chances from Tomba and Belo Rezaq, Salgaocar got their fourth. The pressure was now telling on the Indian Bank defence as Bernard Pires was brought down in the box. The resulting penalty was taken by Salgaocar captain Lawrence, and he converted it, sending goalkeeper Felix Edward the wrong way.

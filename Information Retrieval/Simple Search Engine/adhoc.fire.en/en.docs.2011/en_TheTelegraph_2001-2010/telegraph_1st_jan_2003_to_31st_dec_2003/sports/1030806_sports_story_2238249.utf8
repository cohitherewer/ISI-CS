The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Srinath decision in two weeks
 Srinath, if fit, may be considered for the NZ series Bangalore: Jawagal Srinath said he will take a decision about playing against New Zealand in the next couple of weeks. I am going to England very soon... Maybe in two to three days Ill meet a doctor and seek his opinion on the state of my right knee, Srinath said. I cannot think about cricket until and unless my knee completely heals. However, I will take a decision on returning to the side in two to three weeks. I have just started running, he said. I have to strengthen my knee and I dont want to get back without being fully fit. On his retirement plans, Srinath said: I have not given any thought to it.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

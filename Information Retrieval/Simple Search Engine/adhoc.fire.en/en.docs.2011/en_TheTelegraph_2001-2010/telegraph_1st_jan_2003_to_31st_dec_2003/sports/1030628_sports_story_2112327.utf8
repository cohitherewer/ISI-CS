 Surya stays in second spot
Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan): Draws were the order of the day on top boards and setting themselves up accordingly, Indian GMs Surya Shekhar Ganguly and P. Harikrishna agreed to split the point to continue to trail the leader after the seventh round of the World Juniors Chess Championships Friday. As a result of peace signed on the top six boards, the lead positions remained unchanged and Kadir Guseimov of Azerbaijan continued to be on the top spot in the boys section, taking his tally to 5.5 points. Surya remained in the next lot of five players with five points, while Harikrishna took his score to 4.5. Among girls, Nana Dzagnidze of Georgia maintained her clean slate with a hard fought win over Dronavalli Harika. The other Indian contenders Eesha Karvade and Asian junior champion Tania Sachdev carved out important victories to join Harika in joint second position on 3.5 points apiece along with the Azerbaijan trio of Zeinab Mamedjarova, Aytaj Ismailova and Afag Khudaverdieva.

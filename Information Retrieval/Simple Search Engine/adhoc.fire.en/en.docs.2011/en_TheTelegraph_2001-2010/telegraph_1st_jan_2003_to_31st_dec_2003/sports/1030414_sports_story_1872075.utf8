 Indian men on a roll
Jodhpur: Indian men had one of the most satisfying days in the Asian team chess championship here so far with the A team defeating defending champions Uzbekistan, the B team overwhelming Macau with an absolute score and the C team holding mighty China to a creditable draw in the sixth round of the nine round Swiss league event. The lead positions, however remained unchanged and the Chinese continued their dominance in both mens and womens sections. Their men teams lead, however, was reduced to just one point as Vietnam moved further up with a 3-1 win over Turkmenistan. With China on 16 and Vietnam on their heels, the Indian A and C teams are in joint third spot on 14.5 points each. Half-a-point adrift are India B and Kazakhstan. In the womens section, the Chinese (13.5 points) headed decisively towards the title with a crushing 2.5-0.5 victory over Kazakhstan. The second place in this section is held by Vietnam on 11.5, while India A stand third at 11 points. India B and C hold the fourth place jointly at 10.5.

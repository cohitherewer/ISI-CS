The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barua, Surya begin well
Jamshedpur: Local youngster Baisakhi Das stole the limelight by holding IM S. Poobesh Anand in the first round of the Tata International Open chess tournament on Monday. Most seeded players had easy outings in the 242-player event offering Rs 3,50,000 in total prize money. In another interesting result, Delhi eight-year-old Sahaj Grover held Arghyadip Das to a creditable draw. Grovers trainer Gurpreet Pal Singh was held by Suman Basu in a well contested encounter, while IM Sunderrajan Kidambi sneaked past Bangladeshs S.K. Khasim. GM Dibyendu Barua made mincemeat of N. Srinath. Aminul Islam was similarly drubbed by GM P. Harikrishna, the second seed. Other Indian GMs in fray, Abhijit Kunte and Surya Sekhar Ganguly also had little difficulty in outplaying G. Srinivas and Sanjit Dutta, respectively. Top seed Dmitry Svetushkin of Moldova started his campaign on a positive note with an easy victory over Saket Kumar. Baisakhi, who has moved to Jharkhand to pursue her chess career, did well to hold Poobesh in an interesting game. Despite playing with white Poobesh could not do much as Baisakhi employed right defensive methods. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, September 24, 2003  Mixed bag for Javed trainees 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Ridden by Mark Reuben, the Javed Khan-trainee No Regrets posted a runaway victory in the 2,000m Monsoon Cup on Tuesday. The Rebounding Thrill-Libation son had lifted the trophy last season, as well.				 										Javeds day was, however, also tinged with disappointment. If Flossy had also delivered for the stable, another of Javeds favourites, Never Mind, was withdrawn from the Espoir Cup. It was after the filly became unruly and hurt her leg when handlers tried to push her in the stall without using a hood. The hood had always calmed down the filly, said one of Javeds owners, Bimal Khemka. Ironically, in another race, a hood used on Rare Mettle, a Khemka-property, made the filly restive. She broke the gates, jumped the fence and hurt herself to death. The filly hates being hooded, said Khemka.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

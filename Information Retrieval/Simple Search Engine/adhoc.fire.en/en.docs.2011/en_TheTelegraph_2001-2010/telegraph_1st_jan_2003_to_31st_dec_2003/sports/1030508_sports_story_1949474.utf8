		 Thursday, May 08, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Calcutta Customs Tuesday regained the BHA League first division Group A title they last had in 1996. At the Mohun Bagan ground Wednesday, Customs beat Calcutta Port Trust 2-0, and while they still had a match versus CESC  to go, the fact that CESC drew their match 1-1 with Eastern Railway at the East Bengal ground, allowed Customs to enjoy such a lead that nobody now can touch. Customs have 33 points and are five points adrift of CESC, the second placed team. Even if Customs lose their last match, they have the title anyway. This was Customs 11th win in-a-row.				 																																																	Customs went ahead in the 15th minute when Ayaz Ahmed converted a penalty stroke and Imran Ahmed added another off a solo effort 19 minutes later.				 																																																	CESC were ahead in the seventh minute through an Atal Tirkey goal, but Eastern Railway equalised in the 28th minute via Poulous Soy. There could yet be a fight for second place.				 																																																	Meanwhile, in the Kaivan Cup, Students SC entered the final Wednesday, beating Bengal United 3-0.				 																																																	 S. Madhu (of Andhra Pradesh) and Devanshi Unadkat (maharashtra) were champions in the free-style 12-14 age-group male and female categories, respectively, of the 40th national roller skating championships at the SAI, Eastern Centre complex Wednesday.

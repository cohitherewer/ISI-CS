The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ex-skipper to move HC
Hyderabad: Mohammed Azharuddins lawyers said Thursday the ex-cricketer will move the high court after his appeal to overturn a BCCI life ban on him at the city civil court was dismissed Wednesday by the second additional chief judge. We will move the high court next month to get the ban lifted, Azharuddins lawyer K. Jagadeesh said here. Its not over. In fact, this is just the beginning, he said, hinting that a long legal battle loomed. Azharuddin was banned for life in match-fixing related allegations after a CBI probe in 2000. Both Azharuddin and Jadeja said they were innocent of any wrongdoing and challenged the BCCI decision in separate courts. Jadeja was last month allowed to play domestic cricket by a Delhi court pending a final judgement.  (AFP)  Copyright

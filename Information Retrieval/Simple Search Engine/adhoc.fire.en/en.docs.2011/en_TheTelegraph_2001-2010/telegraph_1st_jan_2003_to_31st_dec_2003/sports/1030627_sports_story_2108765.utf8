The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India rally to hold Germany 2-2
New Delhi: Jugraj Singh scored a last minute equaliser to snatch a 2-2 draw for India (reported briefly in these columns Late City edition Thursday) in a one-off Test against Germany in Duisberg, Wednesday night. India, having squandered a 1-0 lead, were trailing 1-2 when they were reduced to nine men in the last two minutes with both captain Dhanraj Pillay and Kanwalpreet Singh being sent out. But Jugraj kept his nerve and converted a penalty corner seconds before the hooter to draw parity, according to information received here. Earlier, Gagan Ajit Singh gave India an early lead when he scored a field goal in the fourth minute of the match. The Indians, fresh from a successful tour of Australia earlier this month, maintained the lead till the first half, keeping the German forwards at bay. However, the defence slackened a bit in the second half and Germany were able to pump in two goals through Reneat and Kunst. The two goals were an eye-opener for the Indians who started making attacks with a renewed sense of urgency. However they were making little headway, and when Pillay and Kanwalpreet were given the marching orders, it seemed all over for India. However, Jugrajs strike ensured Indias honour remained intact. India now move to Hamburg to participate in a four-nation tournament starting Friday in which Germany, Spain and Argentina are the other teams.  (PTI)  Copyright

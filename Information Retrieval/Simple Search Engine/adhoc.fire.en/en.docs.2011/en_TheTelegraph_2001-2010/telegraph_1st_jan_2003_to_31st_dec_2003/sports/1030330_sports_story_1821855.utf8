The Telegraph - Calcutta
 April date for Nehra ankle surgery
- Indian quick to be operated on by specialist who treated Donald, Pollock, Vaas BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Nehra: To be out for five-six months Calcutta, March 29: Left-arm quick Ashish Nehra, who played a significant role in Indias World Cup 2003 final-reaching campaign, will undergo surgery on his right ankle next month.Nehra, therefore, is going to be out of action for five-six months. He will miss next months tri-series in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup, slated for mid-August in Sri Lanka, but should be fit for the home series against New Zealand.As of now, Nehra will be operated upon (by Dr Sise Perreira) in Pretoria on April 17.Confirming this, Team India physio Andrew Leipus told The Telegraph: If possible, the surgery will be advanced by a couple of days, otherwise April 17 stays.Speaking from his Johannesburg residence this afternoon, Leipus added: Though Nehra severely sprained his left ankle in Pietermaritzburg (versus Namibia), its the right one which requires surgery In fact, he has been troubled by posterior impingement for quite some time.Obviously, with back-to-back commitments  early April- mid May 2001 was the last time any India player got a break for over a month  it wasnt possible for Nehra to be off the circuit for five-six months.

Allrounder Lance Klusener too.Top guns factorMeanwhile, as first reported in these columns (March 22), some of the top guns are set to miss the April 11-20 tournament in Bangladesh. Team India, then, wont fire on all cylinders.The Board, apparently, hasnt been formally intimated but it wont surprise if the overworked Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid make themselves unavailable. Then, theres the continuing question mark over Jawagal Srinath.Actually, theres a bit of a question mark over the tri-series itself as the South Africans havent reconfirmed participation after pulling out of Sharjah.Given the cricketers (perfectly understandable) mood, many will be happy if the tournament  Copyright

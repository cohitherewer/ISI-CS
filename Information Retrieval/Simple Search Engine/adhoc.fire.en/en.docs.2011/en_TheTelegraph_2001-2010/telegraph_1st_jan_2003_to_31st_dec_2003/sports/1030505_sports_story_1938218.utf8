		 Monday, May 05, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	WBA super welterweight champion Oscar de la Hoya after defeating Yory Boy Campas of Navojoa, Mexico at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas Saturday				 																																	Barcelona: Formula One team bosses are considering an informal cost-cutting proposal to condense the Grand Prix weekend and have final qualifying on the morning of the race itself.				 																																	Its a good idea, isnt it, said Eddie Jordan of a proposal put forward by his own director of race engineering Gary Anderson. Can you imagine 9.30 qualifying (on a Sunday morning) and the race five hours later?, added the Irish entrepreneur at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday.Whats wrong with that? Its fantastic.				 																																	Jordan said he would like to see Friday dedicated to testing, rather than practice and first qualifying under a new format introduced this year, with teams banned from more than 20 days of tests during the season. 				 																																	Liverpool: Everton are seeking a restriction on Manchester Uniteds Premier League title celebration at their Goodison Park ground next weekend for safety reasons.				 																																	They also argue on the clubs official website that they are not spoiling the party in asking for curbs on the Premier Leagues presentation of the trophy at the Everton ground.				 																																	We are certainly not killjoys at Everton Football Club, but we have absolutely no intention of cutting corners where the safety of supporters and players is concerned, club spokesman Ian Ross said.				 																																	We have already told the Premier League that we are more than happy for Manchester United to receive the trophy either on the pitch after our players have completed the traditional last day lap of honour or in the dressing room immediately after the final whistle. 				 																																	Hyderabad: After clearing legal hurdles and wading through procedural wrangles, Hyderabad Cricket Associations (HCA) dream of having its own stadium has come true with Andhra Pradesh home minster T. Devener Goud performing the bhumi puja here Sunday.				 																																	The stadium, which is set to be completed by February next would have a capcity of 45,000 and world-class facilites, HCA secretary Shiv Lal Yadav said.				 																																	The Rs 35 crore project spread over 16 acres on the eastern tip of the city would be developed by HCA which is all set to raise funds while the Board of Control for Cricket in India would give a grant for initially grounding the works. 				 																																	Tokyo: Brazil captain Cafu has said he is undecided about joining Yokohama F-Marinos this July despite reaching an agreement with the J-League club at the start of the year, a Japanese newspaper reported on Sunday.				 																																	The 32-year-old was set to move to Yokohama for $3.5 million at the end of his current contract deal with Italian Serie A club AS Roma.				 																																	But the move was apparently thrown into confusion after comments Cafu made in an interview on Italian television over the weekend, according to the Nikkan daily.				 																																	I havent decided yet. I will wait until the end of the season. I havent signed for anybody as things stand now, Cafu was quoted as saying.				 																																	Yokohama officials announced in January that Cafu would become an F-Marinos player on July 1. The defender was understood to have signed a contract for two and a half years. 				 																																	Foxboro (Massachusetts): A senior US soccer federation official confirmed on Saturday that the US will host the womens World Cup finals later this year.				 																																	Fifa announced earlier in the day that the quadrennial tournament would be moved from China  where it was scheduled to be held from September 23-October 11  due to the SARS epidemic in the country.				 																																	Speaking off the record, the official intimated that the announcement would be made in a couple of days, that there could be a slight change in the dates of the tournament and that Fifa completely supported the undertaking of the last-minute change of location. The US are defending world champions, following its victory as hosts in 1999.

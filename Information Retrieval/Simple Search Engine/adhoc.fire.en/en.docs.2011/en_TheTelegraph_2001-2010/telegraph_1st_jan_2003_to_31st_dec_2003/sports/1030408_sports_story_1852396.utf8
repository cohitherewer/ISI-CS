The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Asia Cup TT likely in city
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Its almost eight years since an international table tennis tournament took place in the city. But it seems that big-time table tennis is set to be back to the city next year, if everything goes according to plan. It was learnt that Asia Cup, 2004 is likely to take place in the city. According to a top Table Tennis Federation of India official, the Asia Cup has been awarded to India in February. Though a few other cities are also in contention, its likely that Calcutta will get to host the big event, the TTFI official said. The last international meet to have taken place in the city was the Pro Tour event in 1995. The official informed that at least 40 top-ranked Asian players will take part in the meet. However, for a smooth running of the meet, the TTFI will have to work cohesively with the Bengal Table Tennis Association. We havent received any offers from TTFI, but if something is proposed, we are ready to take up, a BTTA official said. The last Asia Cup took place in China last year. World championship Meanwhile, the camp for the individual world championships, scheduled to take place in Paris at the end of this month, is currently on at Patiala. The Bengal players at the camp are Sourav Chakraborty, Ranabir Das, Mouma Das and Nandita Saha. However, former national champions Poulami Ghatak and Soumyadeep Roy have skipped the camp because of exams. It was also learnt that former national champion Kamlesh Mehta is back as a coach in the academy at Patiala. He had worked with the team earlier but the TTFI didnt continue with his services after the Commonwealth TT last year. But following the players request, he has been brough back.  Copyright

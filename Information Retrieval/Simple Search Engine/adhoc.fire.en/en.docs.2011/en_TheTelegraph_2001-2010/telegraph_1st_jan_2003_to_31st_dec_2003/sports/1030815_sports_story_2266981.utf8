 The teams fitness has improved a lot: Sourav
Bangalore: Taking a break from the testing fitness schedule at the conditioning camp, India captain Sourav Ganguly said on Thursday his team holds home advantage over New Zealand in the upcoming series. We lost to them in New Zealand. We beat them in the World Cup. Obviously, its going to be an important series and we have the advantage of playing at home. We hope to do well, Sourav said. He said the 13-day conditioning camp for 36 probables, which began on Thursday, will focus on fitness. Its more to do with fitness work rather than cricket for the next two weeks. We will be concentrating on fitness, and I hope by the end of the camp we will be much more fit, he said. Fitness of our team has improved immensely in the last one year and we hope to keep on improving. About new physical trainer Gregory King, the skipper said: I dont think he should have any problem. Whatever little bit I have spoken to him, I think he knows what he is talking about. I am really looking forward to working with him for the time he is with us. Coach John Wright said it will not be all work-no fun for the 36 probables, and announced that the plans and goals to be achieved in the coming season would be spelt out. We want to make it challenging, hard-working and also fun, Wright said at the beginning of the 13-day fitness-specific camp here. We will take the opportunity to spell out plans and goals to achieve in the coming season. Meanwhile, Wright said there would be continuity in physical fitness process of the Indian team as King had held detailed discussions with Adrian Le Roux, whom he replaced. He will carry that process on, Wright said. The coach refused comment when asked about the condition of pitches for the upcoming New Zealand series, saying he would like to confine his remarks to only the camp. Meanwhile, King had his first session with the team after taking over. I am looking forward to raising the physical standards further, he said. l Sachin picture on S2  (PTI)  Copyright

 Uefa drags FA over racism fire
Nyon: European soccers ruling body has charged Englands Football Association (FA) over alleged racist abuse by English fans at a Euro 2004 qualifier against Turkey last week. The Uefa had already opened an investigation into pitch invasions by fans and improper conduct by England officials after the match in Sunderland which England won 2-0. Thursdays fresh set of disciplinary proceedings from Uefa followed a complaint by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF). The TFF will also be investigated over allegations of improper conduct by their players in the tunnel after the Group VII game on April 2, Uefa said. The charges will be dealt with on May 1. Police made around 100 arrests before and during the match. Slovakia were forced to play their next home qualifier behind closed doors after their fans chanted racist abuse at England players on October 12.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

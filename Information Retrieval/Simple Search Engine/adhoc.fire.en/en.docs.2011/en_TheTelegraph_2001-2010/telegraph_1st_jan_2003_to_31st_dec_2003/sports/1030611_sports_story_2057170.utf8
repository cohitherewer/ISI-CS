 United agree, Becks may not
London: Manchester United agreed to sell David Beckham to Barcelona Tuesday, but the English superstar indicated he would reject the deal. United said it had accepted a transfer bid from Barcelona presidential candidate Joan Laporta. The club said the deal was contingent on Laporta winning Sundays election and Beckham agreeing to contract terms. Manchester United confirms that, in the event that all of the conditions are fulfilled, then the offer would be acceptable, the club statement said. But Beckhams management company, SFX, issued a statement saying he had no plans to meet Laporta. David is very disappointed and surprised to learn of this statement and feels that he has been used as a political pawn in the Barcelona presidential elections, it said. At a news conference Tuesday, Laporta said: When David Beckham arrives from holiday, we will begin negotiations with him. If I am not elected president, I would turn over the transfer to the man who does win.  (AP)  Copyright

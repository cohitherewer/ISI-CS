 Naimurs no to stop-gap offer
Dhaka: Apparently peeved at the selectors decision to ignore him for the World Cup in South Africa, former Bangladesh captain Naimur Rahman has turned down an offer to join the team for the remaining matches in the ongoing triangular one-day series as a replacement for injured pacer Talha Jubair. Injury to Jubair, who pulled out without playing a single match, had prompted the selectors to ask Rahman to join the team. Chief selector Aliul Islam had asked Rahman whether he was prepared to play in the triangular series but the former captain said he was not physically and mentally fit for international cricket at the moment. Media reports suggested that he declined to join the team as he was unwilling to come in as a stop-gap option. Rahman, who has been in good form in domestic cricket, would not only have provided more depth to the batting but also help as a genuine off-spinner. The local media said Rahman could have spurned the offer out of sheer frustration after he was overlooked for the World Cup despite a very consistent performance at the domestic level. Had Rahman opted to play, the current team would have had three former captains, Akram Khan and Khaled Mashud being the other two. Mashud led the team at the World Cup but was removed from the post following a poor outing. His team lost five matches and the only points they got was from the abandoned match against the West Indies. (PTI)  Copyright

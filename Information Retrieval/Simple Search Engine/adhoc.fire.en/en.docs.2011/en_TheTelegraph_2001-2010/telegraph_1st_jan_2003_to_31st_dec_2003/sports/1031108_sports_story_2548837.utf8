 Flintoff stars in England win 
 Andrew Flintoff in action against Bangladesh during their first ODI in Chittagong on Friday. (Reuters) Chittagong: Andrew Flintoff took four for 14 and then hammered a quickfire half-century as England crushed Bangladesh by seven wickets in the first one-day International on Friday. The Lancashire all-rounder, whose figures of four for 14 off 9.4 overs were his best in one-dayers, helped bowl out the hosts for 143 after five top-order wickets fell for a single run. England then knocked off the runs in 25.3 overs to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. There was only one English hiccup when quick bowler Mushfiqur Rahman grabbed two wickets off successive balls to get rid of openers Marcus Trescothick (28) and Vikram Solanki (10) with 39 on the board. Captain Michael Vaughan followed soon after, stumped for nine while sweeping Monjural Islam to give the left-arm spinner a wicket in his first over in one-day Internationals. But Flintoff settled the issue by hammering his ninth half-century off 45 balls. He finished with 55 not out. Earlier, Bangladesh, opting to bat, had reached 65 for two in the 17th over before caving in dramatically. Fourteen balls later they were 66 for seven.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Subrata sees exit sign at Tolly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Confusion clouds Subratas illness Calcutta: Subrata Bhattacharyas association with Tollygunge Agragami as coach seems as good as over. The coach is currently on a month-long leave, on medical advice, and according to sources, he wont be recalled. There is no chance. Subrata wont be coaching our team any longer. A decision on his replacement will be taken after the football secretary, recovering after surgery in Hyderabad, returns, said a reliable club source on Wednesday. Subrata said he had no knowledge of this. I havent been informed. In fact they didnt even say whether they have accepted my demand for leave. If they call me after the break I want, Ill join them again, the coach said. The club secretary was noncommittal. I am not saying we are sacking him. But we have reason to believe he is fine. In the doctors certificate attached with Subratas letter it was said he needs bed-rest. We know he is not in bed, said Mantoo Ghosh. The other source was more forthcoming. We are thoroughly disappointed with Subrata. His team selection is poor and his behaviour does no good to the confidence of our players. He wont be recalled. He informed one-fourth of the sum promised to Subrata has been paid. Among possible replacements, the names of Biswajit Bhattacharya, Shishir Ghosh, Chinmoy Chatterjee and Krishnendu Roy are doing the rounds.  Copyright

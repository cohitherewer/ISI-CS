				 																																	Stockholm: World No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods is to marry his Swedish girlfriend Elin, a 23-year-old former model, a Swedish newspaper reported on Friday. Woods, 27, popped the question after the Presidents Cup golf competition in South Africa, the daily Expressen said. She said Yes and called her father, telling him: Dad, we are engaged.				 																																	She called me yesterday morning and was incredibly happy, Elins father, Thomas Nordengren, told Expressen.				 																																	Woods and Elin, his girlfriend of two years, had spent a few days in the romantic setting of South Africas Shamwari game reserve near Port Elizabeth, where they cooked their meals over an open campfire. The wedding is to take place in Sweden but the couple are in no rush, Expressen said.				 																																	Belgrade: German soccer legend Lothar Matthaeus, who has moved to Serbia to coach the Partizan club, married a Serbian woman in a private ceremony attended by a few friends.				 																																	Matthaeus married 42-year-old Marianne Kostic, a former wife of Serbian millionaire businessman Miodrag Kostic. The couple tied the knot on Wednesday before a registrar in Matthaeus plush apartment, a guest at the party said. This is Matthaeus third marriage. Both partners bring three children from former marriages into the relationship. None of the children attended the ceremony.				 																																	Buenos Aires: Boca Juniors sealed the Argentine championship with a 2-1 away win over Arsenal 2-1 on Thursday. Boca added the domestic title to the South American Libertadores Cup which they won in the first half of the year.				 																																	Argentinas most popular club clinched their eighth major title under coach Carlos Bianchi despite missing 19-year-old Carlos Tevez, who has inherited the number 10 shirt once worn by Diego Maradona and is now regarded as the countrys most exciting young player. Bianchi took over in June 1998, left at the end of 2001 and returned at the start of this year for a second stint. It was Bocas 20th domestic title since Argentine football turned professional in 1931 but they are still 11 short of their arch-rivals River Plate. 				 																																	San Francisco: Amy Van Dyken, who won four gold medals at the 1996 Olympic Games, was called to testify before the US federal grand jury investigating the BALCO laboratory, it was revealed on Thursday. The 30-year-old Van Dyken was one of the stars of the Atlanta Games where she became the only American woman to win four gold medals at a single Olympiad.				 																																	She now has the unenviable honour of being the first swimmer identified in the drugs and money probe that has focused primarily on players from the NFL, major league baseball and athletics. 				 																																	London: England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is unhappy that a Football Association offer to extend his contract for two years to 2008 has been made public, the Swedes agent has said. Athole Still said that Eriksson had not taken kindly to the offer being publicised by chief executive Mark Palios following an FA board meeting on Thursday. His reaction was one of disappointment.				 																																	Reports said the offer was worth 3.5 million ($6 million) per annum for the four years up to the European Championship of 2008.				 																																	Liverpool: England striker Michael Owen had a thigh scan on Friday to see if he could play in Sundays Premier League game against Birmingham.  Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier was confident  he would be fit. He has a tight muscle, but I do not expect  him to be out of our next game on Sunday against Birmingham.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 11, 2003  Anatolia gets first call 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: The Saturday race-crowd and special invitees from the police headquarters,. Lalbazar, may witness a close contest in the 1,400m Police Commissioners Cup at the RCTC race ground. Dancing Dreams, Star Selection and Anatolia, all three horses, have credentials to land the trophy. If the six-year-old Dancing Dreams boasts of her superior class, the other two are the up-coming youngsters. More importantly, the two four-year-olds are at significant weights advantage against the mare, therefore, they may decide the race between themselves. However, it is the in-form Anatolia who gets the first call. Going by her Oaks run, the Vijay Singh-trainee gives the impression that the Classic Tale-Gold Prospect daughter has come to hand after she was battered by Star Selection in their previous encounters. To be ridden by C. Alford, Anatolia had finished nearly seven lengths ahead of Star Selection in the Oaks.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

 Sachins praise for Hussain
 Sachin feels Hussain was justified in asking Giles to bowl around the legs to him New Delhi: Nasser Hussain, who stepped down as England captain recently, has received whole hearted praise from batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar who described him as a very good captain and always up to something. India and England have had some interesting duels on the field recently... And he (Hussain) was a very good captain, he was always up to something, Tendulkar was quoted by a website. Hussain stunned the cricketing world when he announced his resignation immediately after Englands first Test against South Africa early this week. I felt I was a bit tired and stale, said Hussain. He caused a huge rancour when he asked left-arm spinner Ashey Giles to bowl around Tendulkars leg-stump to curb his strokeplay during a Test series in India two years ago. Giles was successful in his task but Hussain drew widespread criticism for damaging the spirit of the game by resorting to negative tactics. Recalling the incident, Tendulkar said Hussains efforts were within the laws of the game. Every captain has his thinking, his tactics. And Nasser had his ideas. In cricket, sometimes things go your way and sometimes they dont. Regarding Nassers tactics against us, they were within the laws of the game, Tendulkar said.  (PTI)  Copyright

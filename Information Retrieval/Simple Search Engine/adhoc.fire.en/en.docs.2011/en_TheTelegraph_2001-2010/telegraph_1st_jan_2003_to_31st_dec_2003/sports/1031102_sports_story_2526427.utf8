United moved on to 25 points after a 3-0 win over Portsmouth.United, beaten at home by Fulham last weekend, made no such mistake at Old Trafford on Saturday as Diego Forlan gave them a first-half lead, Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo added his first for the club and fellow substitute Roy Keane smashed home a late third.

 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: From coaching a young Juergen Klinsman to training under-14 and 16 boys at the North Calcutta Football Academy, Juergen Mosthaf has seen it all. 																								The German coach, who had been working with the boys at the North Calcutta Academy for the last 10 days, feels that the Indians in the junior level are not much behind their German counterparts.																								However, the real difference lies in coaching. It is mandatory for the boys to learn the correct technique at a budding stage. For that, the coaches should be properly equipped, Mosthaf said.																								He sounded extremely keen to work with the Indian coaches. Earlier, I had worked with the Indian women team in Goa. The Vasco coach (Derek Pareira) and Churchill coach (Marcos Pacheco) contacted me. We had some very good sessions together, Mosthaf added.																								But he was a bit disappointed that the club coaches in Calcutta did not bother to get in touch with him. None of them seems to be interested. It would have been nice if we could discuss a few things. But that doesnt seem to happen.																								Mosthaf also didnt seem too impressed with the quality of the Calcutta teams. I had seen East Bengal in action in the IFA Shield, but there wasnt anything remarkable on show.																								But the Tata Football Academy team has really pleased the veteran coach. They are such a talented lot. Also the way they competed against such heavyweight National League teams, speaks volumes about their temperament. He felt that this kind of competition at such a young level would hold the boys in a good stead in the future.																								He also said that he might come to TFA sometime this year. The coach (Ranjan Chowdhury) extended an offer on behalf of the academy. If I have the time, Ill surely try to make the trip, the coach added.																								However, he feels that the boys from the TFA should not be exposed to the cut-throat competition of club football just now.

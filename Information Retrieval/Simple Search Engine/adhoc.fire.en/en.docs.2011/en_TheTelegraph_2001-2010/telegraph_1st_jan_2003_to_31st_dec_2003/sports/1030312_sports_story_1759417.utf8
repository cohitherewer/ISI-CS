 Saeed Anwar says goodbye
 - Veteran Pakistan opener quits gracefully  amid chaotic Cup aftermath ANWAR: Wants a good  religious life  Islamabad: Veteran Pakistan  opening batsman Saeed Anwar has decided to retire from cricket  saying he wanted to go out gracefully rather than being  thrown out by someone else. I have played enough cricket  and now its time to leave, the 34-year-old left-hander  said. Its not good when people throw you out. I will formally announce my retirement  this week, after speaking with my family, Anwar told a  website. Pakistans World Cup debacle has  already led to coach Richard Pybus and vice-captain Inzamam-ul  Haq stepping down from their posts. Anwars decision may have been  prompted by the common feeling among fans and critics that  the seniors in the team failed to fire putting pressure  on the younger lot and resulting in Pakistans first round  exit from the World Cup.  Anwar, who holds the record for  the highest score in one-day International cricket  194  against india  returned home on Thursday after Pakistans  failed World Cup campaign that included a defeat at the  hands of arch-rivals India. Im really contented because  whatever I wanted from cricket I have achieved. Weve been  a tough unit and have won matches everywhere home and away,  said Anwar who has had 14 years of top international cricket. Anwar said he was honoured to  have played under Imran Khan in the early part of his career  and with one-day crickets two most successful bowlers,  Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, Pakistans current captain.  Saeed made his international debut  in a one-day match in January 1989 against the West Indies,  scoring three before being dismissed by fast bowler Malcolm  Marshall. Overall, he is the sixth-most prolific one-day  batsman with 8,823 runs at an average of 39.21 in 247 games.  In Tests, Anwar amassed 4,052  runs at 45.52, including 11 centuries. Anwar, who came into  the World Cup without top-level cricket for five months  and scored 101, his 20th one-day ton, in the match against  India.  He scored an unbeaten 40 in a  rained out game against Zimbabwe on Tuesday in what seems  to have been his final match.  I scored a hundred in my last  Test against Bangladesh and I was hoping it wouldnt keep  raining against Zimbabwe so I would then have scored a century  in my last one-day International also, Anwar said in a  lighter vein but added, At least I was not out.  The aggressive batsman said he  had enjoyed playing against India and Australia the most.  But now Anwar said he wanted to keep himself away from the  game. I dont want to be involved in  cricket, he said. Ive seen people in Pakistan who are  hanging around in cricket and not having a good life.  Anwar, who became deeply religious  and sported a beard ever since his daughter died a couple  of years ago, admitted that his priorities in life had changed  over the last couple of years. I now want to live a good  religious life, he said.  (PTI) Copyright

		 Thursday, January 09, 2003 				 Nasser was close to quitting, says dad
																								London: Nasser Hussain would have stepped down as the England captain if his team suffered an Ashes whitewash, his father Joe Hussain said Wednesday. 																								Joe told BBC Radio Five: I cant be 100 percent, but the feeling is if England lost 0-5, they would have been looking for a new captain.																								However, a 225-run win in the fifth Test at Sydney ensured a 1-4 result for England.																								Joe added that Nasser was upset by criticism from former England captains Ian Botham and Bob Willis, both commentators for Sky Sports.																								The senior Hussain was particularly severe on Botham saying: I just cant believe someone like Ian can go so hard on Nasser. I dont think Botham won one Test as captain. 																								Meanwhile, Nasser has said he will discuss his future with the selectors after the World Cup, though rumours are that he has already decided to step down after the event.																								England coach Duncan Fletcher, who wants Nasser to say on, was all praise for the captain.																								At times, he was under pressure. But he played so well. He won an important game for England through his captaincy.  (AFP)

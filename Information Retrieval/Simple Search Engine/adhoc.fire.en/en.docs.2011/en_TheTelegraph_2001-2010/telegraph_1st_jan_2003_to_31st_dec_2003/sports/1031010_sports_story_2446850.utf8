				 																																	Paris: Tests on the B samples of American athletes Kelli White and Chris Phillips, who tested positive for Modafinil at the Paris World Championships in August, again revealed traces of the stimulant, French sports daily lEquipe said on Thursday. The newpaper, citing officials at the anti-doping laboratory which conducted the tests in Chatenay-Malabry, near Paris, said tests on the B samples took place earlier this week. Double world sprint champion White now looks certain to lose both her 100m and 200m gold medals since the positive test was confirmed.				 																																	The IAAF had referred the White case to the US anti-doping agency (USADA) who are now expected to hand the case over to the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA).				 																																	Madrid: Deportivo La Corunas radical group of supporters, the Riazor Blues, have decided to disband in response to criticism levelled at them following the death of one of the clubs fans. Manuel Rios Suarez died from his injuries when he was attacked by a member of the radical group after watching his side beat Galician rivals Santiago Compostela 1-0 in a Kings Cup first round match on Tuesday.				 																																	A spokesman for the Riazor Blues said they had taken the decision to wind up the group in recognition that they shared part of the blame for the fans death.				 																																	New Delhi: International Tennis Federation has alloted a new junior tournament to India from next year and has also upgraded the existing event in the national capital from grade 3 to grade 2. A decision to this effect was taken at the ITF junior competitions committee meeting held on October 2, according to an AITA release here on Thursday.				 																																	This is the first time India will be hosting a grade 2 event, it said.				 																																	Chicago: Michael Jordan would not make a comeback to play for the Los Angeles Lakers, even if his former coach Phil Jackson asked him. 				 																																	Jackson, who coached Jordan to six National Basketball Association titles with the Chicago Bulls, might be looking for a guard for the Lakers if star Kobe Bryant, who faces sexual assault charges, is unable to play. 				 																																	Jackson said he would consider asking Jordan, 40, if he would be interested in coming out of his third NBA retirement and joining the Lakers. But Jordan issued a statement saying he would not consider such an offer. 				 																																	Its a 100 per cent no, Jordan said. Jordan wants to return to the NBA, but as a club owner. 				 																																	Paris: French middle distance runner Fouad Chouki was on Wednesday banned for two years by his national federation after testing positive for the endurance-boosting drug EPO. 				 																																	Chouki will also be disqualified from his eighth place finish in the 1,500m at the World Championships in Paris, the French Athletics Federation (FFA) said in a statement after the athlete attended a disciplinary hearing. He tested positive for EPO (Erythropoietin) after the final, which was won by Moroccos Hicham el Guerrouj.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 For some, rain at Big W is good for business
 Fans catch up with their reading as rain delays the start of the womens semi-finals London: Rain or no rain, Wimbledon fans are used to buying wet-weather gear. Just ask Charlotte Pavry, a vendor who was selling plastic rain caps alongside court No. 1 Wednesday.We sell many of them even when its dry, she said. Because people think its going to rain. And thats the British sense of humour.It did pour Wednesday, and Pavry said she sold about 150 caps at $ 5.60 each  in the space of a few hours.The rain may be bad for players and fans, but its good for business. Waterlogged fans jammed the Wimbledon shop tucked under court No. 1 to stock up on a few souvenirs  all carrying the Wimbledon logo.So soaked fans could only read the prices and weep: Mens neckties $ 40-62; hooded sweatshirt $ 72; basic T-shirt $ 37; cricket-style sweater $ 78; wine decanter and two glasses $ 148.Dominating Russiansl Shamil Tarpishchev is predicting great things from his young Russian women. Five Russians made the final 16 this year: 21-year-old Elena Dementieva, 21-year-old Anastasia Myskina, 16-year-old Maria Sharapova, 18-year-old Svetlana Kuznetsova, 18-year-old Vera Zvonareva.I think it marked a great success for our tennis, said Tarpishchev, who heads the Russian tennis federation. Just wait until next year. They will have matured by then and that is why I believe they will win Wimbledon. Were going to dominate womens tennis in the future. From Henman Hilll Two of Wimbledons most dominant themes over the last few years came together Wednesday on Henman Hill.First, sporadic rain stopped play three times. Second, Tim Henman was playing for the seventh time in the quarter finals at Wimbledon as he tries to become the first Englishman to win the mens title in 67 years.We had thunder and lightening at one point and the British dont move, we just sat there and suffered, said Englishman Bill Henry, who was sitting among several thousand fans on the hillside named in Henmans honour behind court No. 1.Watching Henman were suffering anyway. We didnt go anywhere. We just got the brollies up. (AP)  Copyright

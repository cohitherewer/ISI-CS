The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Top award for Steve, Sobers
 Gary Sobers Steve Waugh Melbourne: Australias Test captain Steve Waugh and former West Indies skipper Garfield Sobers received Order of Australia awards in the Queens Birthday Honours list published on Monday.Both were made Officers in the General Division (AO) of the Order of Australia for services to cricket and the community.Waugh has guided his side to the number one spot in the Test rankings and was at the helm for a world record 16 consecutive wins . The Australian batsman has also been active in charity work for children of leprosy sufferers in Calcutta.I guess this award is in part recognition for what Ive tried to do in India but really other people do much more than me, Waugh said. Im a little embarrassed by it all, to be honest, but it is nice that this is part of the recognition that has been given to me and it is nice for cricket.Sobers, the finest all-rounder in cricket history, played for South Australia in the 1960s and retains Australian citizenship through marriage. The 66-year-old played 93 Tests and scored 8,032 runs at 57.78 including a highest score of 365 not out, bettered only by Brian Laras 375 against England in 1994.Former ICC chief executive David Richards and former Australia Test players Norm ONeill and Peter Philpott were honoured with medals in the General Division (OAM).

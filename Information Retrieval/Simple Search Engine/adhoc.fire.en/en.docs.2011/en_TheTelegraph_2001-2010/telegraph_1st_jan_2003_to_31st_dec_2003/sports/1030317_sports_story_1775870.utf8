The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England stars shine for Liverpool
 Real Madrids Ivan Helguera celebrates  after scoring the winner against Villarreal during  their Spanish league match in Villarreal on Sunday
London: Michael Owen set Liverpool on the way to a 3-2 win at Tottenham Hotspur and Robbie Fowler scored his first goal for Manchester City to give them a 1-0 victory over Birmingham City in the Premier League on Sunday. Liverpool climbed to fifth in the standings after Owen and his England teammates Emile Heskey and Steven Gerrard scored second-half goals to sink Spurs at White Hart Lane. Tottenham had taken the lead four minutes into the second half thanks to a 30-metre drive by Argentine defender Mauricio Taricco, but Owen pounced from close range to equalise two minutes later. Heskey headed in Gerrards cross from six metres after 72 minutes to put Liverpool ahead, and Gerrard sealed the three points with a low shot from the edge of penalty area eight minutes from time. Former England striker Teddy Sheringham pulled back a late consolation for the hosts who stayed 10th in the table. Earlier, Fowler volleyed an Ali Benarbia cross into the net with 19 minutes left to earn his new team a deserved three points and leave Birmingham still involved in the relegation dogfight. Real snatch late winner Real Madrid needed a last-minute goal from centre-back Ivan Helguera to snatch a 1-0 win away against Villarreal on Saturday and maintain their one-point lead at the top of the league table. Villarreal had the better chances in an untidy game but Real kept pressing forward and were rewarded at the last gasp as Helguera stabbed in a right-wing cross from Oscar Minambres. Victory briefly gave Real a four-point lead at the top but Real Sociedad and Deportivo Coruna both responded to the challenge to leave the situation unchanged at the top. Real Sociedad came from behind to win 2-1 at Racing Santander with goals from Nihat Kahveci and Valery Karpin. Deportivo had a more straightforward 2-0 success at home to Rayo Vallecano, Roy Makaay and Noureddine Naybet scoring. After 26 games, Real lead the standings with 54 points, followed by Real Sociedad on 53 and Deportivo Coruna on 51.  (Reuters)  Copyright

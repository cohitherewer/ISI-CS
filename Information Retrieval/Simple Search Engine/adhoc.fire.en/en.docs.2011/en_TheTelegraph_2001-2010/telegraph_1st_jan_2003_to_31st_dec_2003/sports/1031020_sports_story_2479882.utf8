The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kasprowicz in for Lee
 Kasprowicz Sydney: Australia have turned to paceman Michael Kasprowicz to help them out on their tour of India after their frontline bowling attack was wiped out by injuries. Kasprowicz, 31, was recalled to the side after Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee were ruled out. With injuries to our senior bowling line-up, we felt that on this occasion it was necessary to look for another quick, Australias chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said in a statement. Michael also has experience in the challenging conditions of the sub-continent and that will be a real asset to the squad.

 Kapil calls for uniformity of policy 
Bangalore: Cricket legend Kapil Dev on Thursday slammed the governments double standards, for waiving of Rs 1.13 crore as duty on the Ferrari car gifted to ace batsman Sachin Tendulkar by Fiat and called for a uniform policy for all sports-persons. While I am happy about Sachin getting a car, it (duty waiver) should apply to every sports-person. That is more important, Kapil said here. Why can we not have the same system for everybody...Because everybody sweats for his country. I think they (finance ministry) should have given a concession as it was in their hands...Change of policy totally, I dont think its a good point, he said. You cant change policy for one person. If you change policy, you change it for everybody, Kapil said. If you charge duty, then this policy (of exemption for Sachin) is wrong. If you dont, then this policy is fair, he said. You have to set a precedent, and you can set a precedent. I hope government is in a better position to answer. I paid duty on both my cars. I feel it should not happen like this. He recalled that some two years ago, the government did not give even a penny as relief to golfer Amandeep Johl who had won a Lexus in a tournament in South Korea and ultimately he had to forfeit the car. This kind of double standard should not be practised, the Kapil said. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Souravs captaincy has direction: Steve
- I dont know whether I will be around... winning the 2004-2005 series in India is a collective target for Australia BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sourav GangulySteve The vibes between the two werent terrific in the 2000-2001 series (the last set of India-Australia bilateral engagements), but Sourav Ganguly continues to draw inspiration from Steve Waugh.In fact, the Team India captain readily acknowledges that. As for Australias Test captain and icon, he is happy to be admired by one of his peers.Its nice being admired by a peer However, it also means Ive grown old, that Ive been around for quite some time (from 1985-86), the 38-year-old Steve told The Telegraph, Thursday, a few hours before completing his city commitments and leaving for Chennai.He added: I suppose Sourav and I can relate to each other as both are captains and understand the pressure and responsibility Sourav (captain since March 2000) is growing in the job and hes been very good.Indeed, his captaincy has direction and he enjoys his teams respect Captaincy calls for tough decisions and he doesnt go for soft options. Under Sourav, the boys havent been backing down and they seem to enjoy a fight. Overall, theres a new toughness and your cricket now has an edge.In Steves opinion, though, Team India must improve the overseas-record. I can appreciate why Sourav is desperate to do well outside the country and, if I may add, there has been an improvement in Indias away-performances.Asked about areas where Sourav could improve, he answered: Hard to say, for I havent actually analysed him as captain Whats relevant is that the boys are playing tight and solid cricket. Earlier, most Indian sides would fall apart under pressure  not this one.The last India versus Australia encounter (at any level) was this years World Cup final and, as has been well documented, India were beaten black and blue. Moreover, the debate over whether Sourav was right in inserting Ricky Ponting and Co. is going to continue.Steve, for his part, had this to say: On that specific issue, my comments today will be quite irrelevant But, yes, I do feel the toss gets overestimated. If every captain who wins the toss wins the game, then why play? Your approach should be such that whatever you choose to do first enhances the chance of winning.Assuming that he doesnt decide to quit, between now and the visit by India beginning end-November, Steve and Sourav will be in each others path during the four-Test series Down Under.[Significantly, asked whether seeking to avenge the 2000-2001 Test series defeat in 2004-2005  when Australia next undertake a full tour  was a target, he responded: I dont know whether Ill be around Form, desire, selection So many factors will come into play and, so, its a collective target for Australian cricket. What I can confidently say is that it will be as great a series as the last one.] By then, of course, Steve (already the most capped Test cricketer) will probably be even more of an Elder Statesman.Its nice to be in that position The pressure is more, but I dont mind What legacy will I be leaving behind? Dont know I would, however, like to be remembered as somebody who always gave 100 per cent, he remarked, as the time neared for another meeting on the proposed facility (outside Udayan) for the leprosy sufferers daughters. That 100 per cent bit wont be a problem.  Copyright

 							 - euro round-up l Mallorca hold Real in Kings Cup				 	 Real Madrids Roberto Carlos evades the challenge of Mallorcas Fernando Nino Bejera during their Kings Cup quarter final, first leg match in Madrid Thursday. (AP/PTI) 																								Rome: A spectacular late goal by striker Fabrizio Miccoli helped Perugia upset Juventus 2-0 and complete the league champions shock elimination from the Italian Cup on Thursday.																								Perugia, who added an injury-time penalty by Brazilian defender Ze Maria, completed a 4-1 aggregate quarter-final victory with their second leg home win and will meet AC Milan in the last four.																								It was always going to be an uphill struggle for Juve after their 1-2 defeat in the first leg in Turin left them in need of at least two goals to stand any chance of going through.																								Juventus, however, had the better of a quiet first half. Italian international striker Marco Di Vaio nearly put them ahead with a free kick in the 43rd minute, but keeper Zeljko Kalac managed to beat the ball away.																								The home players came out stronger after the interval, but found themselves pressed back into their own half after Juve coach Marcello Lippi introduced Pavel Nedved in the 68th minute.																								Two minutes after coming on, the Czech midfielder nearly put Juve ahead, shooting narrowly wide from the edge of the area. Perugia seemed to be hanging on for the end. But with just five minutes left Miccoli broke down the right and with the Juventus defence backing off, rifled a shot past keeper Antonio Chimenti from 25 metres.																								The tie was effectively over but in the last minute of injury time Chimenti brought down Perugia midfielder Luigi Pagliuca and Ze Maria converted from the penalty spot.																								Milan face Perugia while Lazio and AS Roma have set up a Roman derby in the semi-finals. 																								Uphill battle 																								In Madrid, Real Madrid will face an uphill battle to reach the last four of the Kings Cup after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Real Mallorca in a tight quarter-final first leg at the Bernabeu on Thursday.																								Young striker Javier Portillo put Real ahead on 13 minutes, heading in a cross from Raul Bravo, but there were few other chances for Vicente del Bosques side in an unconvincing performance.																								Mallorcas Cameroon international Samuel Etoo had two goals disallowed, one either side of Portillo strike, before the visitors hit back just before the hour with a brilliant piece of work from Miguel Angel Nadal.																								The former Barcelona centre back appeared at the far post to control a corner on his chest and swat the ball in right-footed to level the score.																								Del Bosque responded by bringing on Luis Figo and Raul alongside Portillo and Ronaldo but that quartet failed to trouble the Mallorca defence and Real left the field to whistles from their own supporters.

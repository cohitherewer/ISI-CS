 New life for Olonga
London: Medium pacer Henry Olonga has been granted a work permit by the British immigration authorities and he is expected to be here later this week. According to reports here Sunday, the 26-year-old was packing his belongings at a safe house in South Africa to prepare for his epic journey to a new life. A report in The Mail on Sunday said a jubilant Olonga, who quit international cricket at the end of Zimbabwes World Cup campaign, said last night: I am so very pleased. I have a lot of people to thank for what they have done for me. So many people have played a role in this affair and I owe them all a deep debt of gratitude. Hopefully, when I get to England, I can repay their friendship. This is a dream come true. Warning that six million Zimbabweans could be facing starvation in a years time, he said: I think things are going to change and change quickly. When things come right, Ill go back. But, even as the shackles of three weeks in hiding were made ready for removal, the fear of the tap on the shoulder remained a threat to Zimbabwes first black Test cricketer as he politely declined to give details of his flight plans.

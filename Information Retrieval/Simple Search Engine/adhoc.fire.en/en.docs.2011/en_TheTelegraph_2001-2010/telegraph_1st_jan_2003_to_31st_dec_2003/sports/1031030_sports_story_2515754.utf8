 Ferdinand charged with misconduct
 Rio Ferdinand leaves his home near Manchester on Wednesday. (Reuters) London: Rio Ferdinand was charged with misconduct by the FA on Wednesday for failure or refusal to take a drugs test. Ferdinand missed a random dope test on September 23 at his clubs Carrington training ground, though he passed a test 36 hours after the scheduled one. In a statement on Wednesday the FA said Ferdinand had been charged in relation to Regulation 1 (c) of its Doping Control Regulations. Regulation 1(c) refers to the failure or refusal by a player to submit to drug testing as required by a competent official, the FA said. Ferdinand has not, however, been charged with the more serious offence of wilful failure to comply. The 24-year-old has 14 days to respond to the charge.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

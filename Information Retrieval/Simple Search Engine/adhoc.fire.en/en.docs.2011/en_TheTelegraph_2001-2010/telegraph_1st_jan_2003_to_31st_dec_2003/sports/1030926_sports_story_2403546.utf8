The Telegraph - Calcutta
 US Olympic body has wings clipped
Washington/Lausanne: The US Olympic Committee Wednesday said even though 24 American athletes who won Olympic medals had previously tested positive for banned drugs, the cases were handled properly without any cover-ups. The US Senate, though does not seem to have bought the story, and has agreed to streamline the USOC to bring more accountability to the scandal-ridden organisation. Legislation, approved by voice vote, would dramatically scale back the USOCs governing structure and provides more congressional oversight. Instead of 124 members, the new USOC board of directors would have nine members, plus the US delegates to the IOC and a representative from the Olympic Assembly. The USOC will report the case to the IOC.  (AP)  Copyright

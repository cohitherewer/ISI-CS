 BCCI pays players pittance: Sidhu 
Amritsar: Former India opener Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday accused the Board of Control for Cricket in India of paying players a meagre sum while playing abroad and said there is no transparency in the collection of revenues from the matches. The cricketer-turned-commentator said: When the team goes abroad, each player is paid a meagre amount of Rs 2 lakh out of the huge collection of nearly Rs 70 crore by the BCCI. There is no transparency in the functioning of the BCCI in revenue collections from the matches, he said. The BCCI is one the richest boards in the world but it hardly bothers to spend the required money on the mandatory practice and the infrastructure facilities required for the players.

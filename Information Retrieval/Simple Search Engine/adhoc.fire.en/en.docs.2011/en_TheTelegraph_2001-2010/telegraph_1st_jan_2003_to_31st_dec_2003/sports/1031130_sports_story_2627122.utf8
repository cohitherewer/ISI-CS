 Kumble sees first XI berth
Brisbane, Nov. 29 (PTI): Anil Kumble, who took four wickets on the opening day against a Queensland team on Saturday, felt good to have a long bowl. It felt good to get back to your rhythm and bowl 20 overs. Im sure Im in contention for selection in the 11 for the first Test, Kumble said. The 33-year-old agreed the fast bowlers were a bit inconsistent in their first spells and put it down to little cricket by his team in recent times. Im sure we would have loved to have a lot of wickets with the new ball. We started off well but unfortunately didnt keep it going. We would love to be consistent but everyone is playing a first class or a three-day game after a long time. We have lately been playing only one-dayers. It takes a bit of time to get used to it, he said. They began to get better after 13 or 14 overs and hopefully the second time around they (pace bowlers) would have rediscovered their rhythm, the veteran spinner said. These are tough conditions and there is little margin for error. It is one of those days when you have to bat for thelast seven overs and it could be difficult.  Copyright

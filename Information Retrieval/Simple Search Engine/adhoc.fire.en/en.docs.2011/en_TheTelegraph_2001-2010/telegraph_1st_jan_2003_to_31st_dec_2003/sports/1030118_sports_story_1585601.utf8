				 																																	Charlotte: Former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison for the 1998 abduction of his estranged wife and children.				 																																	Bowe was in court for the three-minute hearing on Thursday. US district judge Graham Mullen had twice previously given Bowe lighter sentences that were rejected by the appeals court.				 																																	After Bowe is released from prison, he must serve two years supervised release. Bowes lawyer, Robert Altchiler, indicated the fighter could return to the ring after he serves his time.				 																																	London: The English Football Association (FA) has given the go-ahead for the development of an 80 million National Football Centre planned for Burton-on-Trent in central England. Several million pounds had already been spent securing the land and making the early preparations, but support for the project was under review as the FA decided whether it could be fully committed to the centre at this time.				 																																	However, after the FAs main board met on Thursday for the first time this year it issued a statement saying: It was unanimously agreed to proceed with the development of the National Football Centre as soon as possible. 				 																																	 Nyon: European soccer governing body Uefa on Thursday banned Celta De Vigo midfielder Peter Luccin for four matches for spitting at an opponent during a Uefa Cup match pitting his club against Scottish side Celtic.				 																																	Uefa said video evidence showed that the 23-year-old Frenchman spat at Celtics John Hartson, but that the referee missed the incident during the December 12 game. Uefa said Luccin and Celta De Vigo may wait until January 19 midnight to appeal the ban, which covers all Uefa club competition matches.

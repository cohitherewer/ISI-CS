 Ghate nears 2nd WGM norm
Edinburgh: Indias Swati Ghate increased her chances of obtaining a second Woman Grandmaster norm after settling for a draw with GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly in Round IV of the British Chess Championship here on Friday. Draws were the order of the day on top boards and that enabled GM Zia-ur-Rahman of Bangladesh and Daniel Gormally of England to join overnight leaders, Englishmen Adam Hunt and Aaron Summerscale in the lead with 3.5 points. Sixteen players remain on the heels of the four leaders with three points each. The pack includes top seed Vassilos Kotronias of Cyprus, Indians P. Harikrishna, Abhijit Kunte, Surya, S. Kidambi, Swati and Gurpreet Pal Singh. Singh sprang a major surprise, beating IM Enamul Hossain of Bangladesh. Dibyendu Barua, meanwhile, drew with Matthew Anderton. Neelotpal Das crashed to another defeat against Ameet Ghasi and Tejas Bakre was held by Nasir Ahmed. Kunte beat Nisha Mohota while Kidambi drew with Jonathan Rowson.  (PTI)  Copyright

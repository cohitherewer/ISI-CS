 Holland ride twin tons to victory
  Feiko Kloppenburg, who made 121, after reaching his century 
on Monday. (AFP) Bloemfontein: Klaas Jan van Noortwijk and Feiko Kloppenburg hammered centuries as Holland recorded their first one-day International victory by beating Namibia in the World Cup on Monday.The delighted Dutchmen ended their tournament with a 64-run win after hammering 314 for four in the battle of the group A minnows.Van Noortwijks run-a-ball 134 equalled the sixth highest individual score of the 2003 Cup  he was close to tears at the end of his innings  while Kloppenburg made 121 as the pair put 228 for the second wicket.No Dutchman had scored a World Cup century before.The 32-year-old Van Noortwijk, who hit slashing off drives and hoists to midwicket, had scored the previous Dutch record of 64 runs in the 1996 World Cup against England. However, in his previous three World Cup games before Monday he had only scored 20.Kloppenburg made sure of the Man-of-the-Match award, though, by taking four wickets for 42 from 10 overs. Namibia made an enterprising reply but gradually fell behind the asking rate after their openers put on 76 by the 14th over. They were dismissed for 250 in 46.5 overs.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI set for tough stand against sponsor
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may blacklist Pepsi if the Purchase-headquartered multinational continues to insist on damages arising out of the World Cup 2003-related Player Terms row featuring the Sourav Gangulys.Though the claim has been placed before the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), which holds marketing rights of all International Cricket Council (ICC) events till the 2007 World Cup, the damages could eventually land at the BCCIs door.If Pepsi persists with its claim, we will have to take a firm stand on not associating with that multinational. Clearly, we cant encourage a situation whereby one of our partners is actually out to hurt the interests of Indian cricket, an influential BCCI member told The Telegraph, Monday.While it couldnt be confirmed, Pepsis scaled down demand for damages is in the region of Rs 17 crore, covering the period between now and the 2007 World Cup (in the West Indies). As of now, then, the BCCI runs the risk of having to cough up that amount.Its another matter, of course, that the dispute may first head for the Lausanne-located Court of Arbitration for Sport. In any case, the ICC  specifically, its business arm IDI Limited  has held back $ 9 million, Indias share of the World Cup guarantee money.[Incidentally, withholding that hasnt been well received by the BCCI. We dont sit on any money If we are denied our share, its the development of the sport which will suffer, pointed out a peeved Kishore Rungta, the treasurer, when contacted in Jaipur.] In the immediate context, Pepsis claim could result in the BCCI deciding not to entertain a bid for sponsoring Tests and ODIs at home, from the next (2003-2004) season.Pepsis (latest) three-season contract, which became effective from 2000-2001, has ended. The BCCI received Rs 85 lakh for every Test/ODI and Pepsi had the right to assign the sponsorship title elsewhere, subject to the BCCIs approval. According to the influential member, its possible that the much-delayed business of offering contracts to the players will be expedited and, more important, there may be a clause forbidding either entering into/renewing personal endorsements with a corporate entity blacklisted by the BCCI.Besides Team India captain Sourav, Pepsi is endorsed by Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V.V.S.Laxman, Harbhajan Singh, Ajit Agarkar, Mohammed Kaif, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh. Whatever is put in place will surely go through hours and hours of deliberations At the moment, its a delicate issue. Having said that, the BCCI will have to set an example if Pepsi insists on damages, the influential member added.LG Electronics, too, has filed a claim. The BCCI, however, doesnt have a tie-up with the South Korean multinational. Like Pepsi, LG enjoyed Global Partner status in the World Cup.Significantly, contrary to reports (filed by a wire agency, Sunday), Official Sponsor Hero Honda apparently hasnt moved for damages.Obviously, such a stand is in keeping with its Desh ki Dhadkan image and will come as a relief to BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is busy finalising strategy to counter any claim.

 Love to do well in singles: Sania
 A dream come true, says Sania Mirza Mumbai: Having made history by winning a Grand Slam title, teen tennis sensation Sania Mirza arrived in Mumbai Tuesday with a renewed purpose to do well in the singles as well at the US Open next month. The 16-year-old became the first Indian girl ever to win a Grand Slam title when she won the Wimbledon girls junior doubles title partnering Russias Alisa Kleybanova at on Sunday. Sania, however, would not be able to pair up with Alisa at the US Open as the Russian has pulled out of the Grand Slam due to personal reasons. I will not be partnering Alisa at the US Open as she has decided not to play for personal reasons, said Sania after her arrival from London. Moreover I want to concentrate on my singles performance though I will be playing in the doubles as well with a new partner. Sania did not rule out partnering an Indian but said she will have to wait and see how things turn out before arriving at a decision. On her triumph at Wimbledon, Sania said: It is a great feeling to be the first Indian woman to win a Grand Slam title. I am very happy about it though I was not expecting to win it. I just decided to play in the doubles after Alisa said she was looking out for a partner and now I am very happy I decided to play with her, she added. Sania said she was not even aware that she was the first Indian woman to win a Grand Slam. Once I came to know of it I was thrilled and I consider this a dream come true though I would love to do well in singles as well in the near future, she said.  (PTI)  Copyright

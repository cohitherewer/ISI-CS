																								Zurich: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis said she might never play professional tennis again. The 22-year-old decided to take a break from the game in October because of a lingering foot injury and disappointing results since she returned to competitive action last August.																								She was expected to participate in the Australian Open but raised doubts about her future in the sport when she withdrew from the event in December. 																								It is totally possible that I wont play top tennis again, because my feet will not allow it, Hingis was quoted as saying in the Blick newspaper.																								While the top players battle it out at the Australian Open, Hingis said she was happy to take it easy at home, improving her English, and her desire to compete again is waning by the day.																								She said she enjoyed the lack of stress and competitive drive in her life and did not miss playing at the first Grand Slam of the season in Melbourne, which she won in 1997, 1998 and 1999.																								Im having fun being able to watch the others, how they are running around in the heat on court. When I wake up I always look for the results on teletext. Im also following the tournament in the papers and watch it on TV every now and then.																								Im not bored. Ive spent the last two months doing lots of sport  skiing, riding, long walks in the wood with my dog.																								And Im now going to school  Im trying to perfect my English. And also finally I now have more time for my private life.																								Hingis had surgery on her ankle last May when two ligaments were replaced and never recovered her best form. Her tactical game has also been rendered obsolete by the powerful Williams sisters. Health-wise I cannot complain and my feet are okay if I dont force it when Im playing tennis. But as soon as I try to train competitively, the pain starts.  (REUTERS)

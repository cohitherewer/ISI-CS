The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its good to have a few butterflies  in your stomach before a game
 cricket online How does one bowl the flipper  and what should be the correct length? (Mollier, 17, Nagaland) Flipper is a delivery that skids  through after pitching. The right length is just short of  a length where the batsman gets a feeling that he can pull  the ball.  I am an allrounder. But  I feel very nervous before every game and this affects my  performance. How do I overcome this? (Anurag Biswas, 10, Calcutta-59) Think positively. Think about  your strengths, though, its good to have a few butterflies  in your stomach before a game.  I am a fast bowler. How  do I avoid over-stepping? (Amitava Mukherjee, 15, Barrackpore) Lots of practice at the nets. I am an allrounder. I fail  to control my outswinger despite bowling close to the stumps.  Please help. (Gibbs Latrindika Khiangte,  15, Aizawl) Focus on the spot where your want  the ball to land.  I am a righthanded batsman.  I always get bowled playing a full-pitch ball. I dont understand  where lies the problem since I always watch the ball closely  and play straight. (Rahul Kedia, 22, Calcutta-26) You are lifting your head too  soon. Make sure the head is down at the time of contact. How can one improve running  between the wickets? (Avishek Acharya, 17, Palta) For starters, make sure the calling  is loud and clear. You should also practice with a runner  at the nets. Whenever a leg spinner flights  the ball, I try to step out and play, but often get bowled  or stumped. Please help. (Utsav De, 17, Calcutta-32) Get as close to the pitch of the  ball as possible to solve this problem. Also avoid lifting  your head too soon. I am a righthanded opener.  I often get caught behind or in the slip cordon while trying  to drive half-volleys. How do I avoid this? (Ryan Mullick, 14, Calcutta-26) You are playing with the ball  away from the body. It also means you are not getting close  enough to the pitch or the line of the ball. I am a righthander and often  get caught when playing a square cut. Please help. (Lalit Kr Talan, 17, Kharsawan) Get your weight into the shot  by going back and across. How does one reverse swing  the ball. Should there be a change in grip? (Md Afroz Alam, 13, Calcutta-16) First concentrate on natural swing.  Reverse swing will come to you naturally. Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mohammedan AC beat CPT
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Najimul Haq (white jersey) of Mohammedan AC tries to get past CPT defenders during their Super Division match at the Mohun Bagan ground Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: New Super Division entrants Mohammedan AC kicked off their campaign with a 2-1 victory over Calcutta Port Trust at the Mohun Bagan ground Tuesday. Subrata Guha put Mohammedan AC ahead in the eighth minute. CPT, who finished fifth in the league last season and were part of the second division National League, equalised in the 64th minute through Pradeep Indu. But Najimul Haq struck the decider two minutes later to ensure three valuable points. At the East Bengal ground, Ever Ready defeated Bhratri Sangha by a Jayanta Sen goal in the 22nd minute of the second half. Sen, who switched allegiance from Mohun Bagan this season, made the most of an open goal following a corner. At the Howrah Muncipal Stadium, Eastern Railway rode Benoy Sahas second-half hattrick to a 3-1 victory over Railway FC. S.S. Chakraborty had put Railway FC ahead in the first half. Elsewhere, West Bengal Police scraped past Wari by a similar margin, Narugopal Ghosh was the scorer. Mohammedan AC enjoyed the better of the exchanges in the first half as their more fancied rivals struggled to keep the marauding Najimul and Amar Ganguly at bay. However, CPTs goalkeeper Gopal Das was largely to be blamed for letting in both the goals. Guhas strike from about 30 yards away was sailing into the goalmouth melee harmlessly until Das fumbled while trying to grip the ball. The sudden reversal early into the game sent CPTs plans into disarray. Mohammedan AC, cheered on by around 5,000 supporters, managed to hold onto the lead till the interval. CPT tried to get their act together in the second half and the Reaz-ul Mustafa-led Mohammedan AC defence came under intense pressure. CPTs Souren Sardar missed a sitter, shooting over the top with only the goalie at his mercy. Indu made amends a little later, capitalising on an Amar Pyne pass from the right and placing the ball to the left of the goalkeeper. CPT seemed to be clawing their way back into the game but Mohammedan AC settled the issue via a counterattack. An almost solo effort from Najimul saw him getting past a couple of defenders before putting the ball out of the reach of the advancing Das. The CPT defenders were woefully out of position and Das made matters worse by leaving his position early on. Peerless held In first division group A action, Peerless were held 2-2 by FCI. In second division, Jorabagan Clubs A. Bhaduri was given marching orders by referee Prabir Dhar for rough play. Jorabagan beat Young Corner 1-0.  Copyright

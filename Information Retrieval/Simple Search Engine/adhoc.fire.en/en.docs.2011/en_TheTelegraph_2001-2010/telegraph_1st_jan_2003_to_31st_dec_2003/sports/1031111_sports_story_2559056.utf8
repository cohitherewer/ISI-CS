The Telegraph - Calcutta
 New Zealand seek pyschologists assistance
New Delhi: A desperate New Zealand are now seeking help from a psychologist in their efforts to win the tri-series and prepare mentally for the upcoming tour of Pakistan. New Zealand Crickets (NZC) sports psychologist Gilbert Enoka is set to join the side in Hyderabad on Tuesday, in time for the teams do-or-die match against India on Sunday. The Black Caps succumbed to their sixth consecutive loss to Australia on Sunday in Guwahati and now need to beat India for a place in the final against the world champions. Besides addressing to the tri-series woes, the psychologist is also expected to talk to the players about their upcoming tour of Pakistan. Its a key time for him (Enoka) to come over, Stephen Fleming was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald website.  Different players will approach it in different ways, but certainly if youre struggling mentally hes the one to talk to, he said. Enoka will talk to the players about the tour of Pakistan in the wake of NZCs option to the cricketers to opt out of the tour if they felt uncomfortable due to any reason. New Zealand are slated to play five one-day matches to make up for the unfinished Test in Karachi last year. A bomb blast outside the team hotel in Karachi led to the abandonment of the match. Memories of that bomb blast in May last year are still fresh among the players, although Fleming confirmed he was available for the tour. Were trying to keep it pretty low key because we want to win this tournament (tri-series). On the teams fortunes in the tri-series, Fleming said it was not crisis point yet but conceded there were some problems which needed to be addressed. Were not far away, but far enough to be frustrated... You can talk about it and identify it, but its all about the pressure. On his own poor form on the tour, Fleming said, I dont know... I cant explain it. Im pretty close but Im letting the team down. Its very frustrating and it has nagged me for the whole tour, said the skipper.  (PTI)  Copyright

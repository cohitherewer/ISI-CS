 Saptarshi stuns Harikrishna
Calicut: Bengals Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury turned the tables on top seed Grandmaster P. Harikrishna in Round II of the 41st National A Chess Championship here on Thursday. With most of the 12 games ending in a draw, nine players emerged as leaders on one point apiece on the opening day of the competition. They are Saptarshi, Grandmasters Dibyendu Barua, Sandipan Chanda of ONGC, Surya Shekhar Ganguly and R B Ramesh of IOC, Pravin Thipsay of Union Bank, Koneru Humpy of Bank of Baroda, International Masters Tejas Bakre of Indian Airlines and Vishal Sareen of LIC. Playing black, Saptarshi struggled for most of the game but in the end his perseverance paid off as Harikrishna got his king entangled in a mating web. The opening was a queens gambit declined and Harikrishna had castled on the queens wing to initiate a king side attack. In another game, Surya forced a quick draw with national womens champion Humpy. Following suit was Abhijit Kunte who also settled for a quick draw with Barua while Suvrajit Saha drew with Sareen in a level position immediately after the opening. (PTI)  Copyright

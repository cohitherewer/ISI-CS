 Buoyant Delhi take on Tamil Nadu
New Delhi: Spurred on by Virender Sehwag Delhi take on Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy semi-final at the Ferozshah Kotla Friday. Sehwag apart, the other two back from national duty are Gautam Gambhir and off-spinner Sarandeep Singh. Delhi, will however, miss the services of Ashish Nehra, who is recuperating after a knee-operation. Despite the star-cast, Delhi are likely to face a tough challenge from Tamil Nadu, who have the likes of Sadagopan Ramesh, S. Sharath, S. Sriram, Hemang Badani and L. Balaji in their ranks. Tamil Nadu will go into the match with six specialist batsmen and four bowlers. Captain Suresh said his side will have to score heavily to put pressure on the opponents. Baroda upbeat Meanwhile, the return of speedster Zaheer Khan will bolster Barodas chances when they take on Mumbai in another semi-final at the GSFC ground in Vadodra. Baroda captain Connor Williams said: The teams morale is very high and we are eager to win this match and make the final. Zaheer played a pivotal role last season when Baroda finished runner-up losing to Railways in the final. (PTI)  Copyright

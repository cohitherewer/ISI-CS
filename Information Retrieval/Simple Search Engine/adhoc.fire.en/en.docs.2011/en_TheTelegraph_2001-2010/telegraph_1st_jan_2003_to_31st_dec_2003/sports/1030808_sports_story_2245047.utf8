The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dravids 114 goes in vain
London: Rahul Dravids quickfire 114 failed to save Scotland as the English county minnows crashed to a 75-run defeat against Northamptonshire in a National Cricket League one-day match at County Ground on Wednesday. Electing to bat, Northamptonshire put on a massive 319 for seven in 45 overs with overseas player Mike Hussey making a fine 123 and P. Jacques 76. Scotland were never in the hunt and barring Dravid, who made a 102-ball 114, no other batsmen could score enough on a turning track to take their side even close to their rivals total. The visitors lost all their wickets for 244 in 43.4 overs. Coming in to bat when Scotland were reeling at 16 for two, the Indian vice-captain played the dominant role in the most productive partnership of the innings, an 86-run stand with Neil Macrae (38) for the third wicket. Dravid hit eight boundaries and a six during his knock, in the process crossing 500 runs for the season in his ninth innings, before getting out as the last man.  Kaifs 72 not enough Mohammed Kaif rediscovered his form but Derbyshire crashed out in Bristol Thursday. Kaif played a pivotal role with a well-paced 72 to help Derbyshire post a respectable 219 but it was not enough to stop Gloucestershire from squeezing out a narrow one-wicket win in the semi-final tie.

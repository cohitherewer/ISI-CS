The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bar on dressing room entry
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Though heckled by club officials after Tuesdays defeat at the hands of Mohammedan Sporting in the Federation Cup semi-finals, Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee will be back at practice Thursday. Mukherjee said after a meeting with players Jose Ramirez Barreto and Rennedy Singh, goalkeeper coach Atanu Bhattacharya, physio Robson Mattos de Oliviera, assistant-secretary Balaram Chowdhury and executive committee members Keshto Saha and Om Jhunjhunwala, that the misunderstanding has been cleared. The officials promised me what happened on Tuesday will not be repeated in the future. The players also reposed faith in me, Mukherjee said. The coach was manhandled inside the dressing room by some officials after the green-and-maroon brigade lost in the tie-breaker. The senior players thoroughly criticised the events, saying they have never seen such events in their lives. What happened was totally uncalled for. This can really be discouraging for the boys, a senior player, preferring anonymity said. He also added that these things only show the amount of factionalism there is between the club officials. However, it has been decided in the meeting that unwanted elements will not be allowed inside the dressing room in future. Yesterday, too many people got inside the dressing room, thereby causing the trouble. From now on, no one other than the players, coaches and the executive committee members will be allowed inside the dressing room, the assistant secretary said. Also, the coach and captain Rennedy, will only be allowed to interact with the press. Chowdhury said the players will have a seven-day camp at the SAI from Saturday, under Robson and the two coaches. Meanwhile, star striker Ashim Biswas, who has been out with niggling knee problems, underwent surgery at a city hospital Wednesday.  Copyright

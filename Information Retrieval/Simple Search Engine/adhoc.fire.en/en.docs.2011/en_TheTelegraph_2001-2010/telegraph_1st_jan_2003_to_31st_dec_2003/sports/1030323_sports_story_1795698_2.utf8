The big match is being fought out in Iraq and not in South Africa. My priority is the Iraq war. I am only watching BBC late into the night and throughout the day

Im not sure if I will be watching the final as I think cricket is the most stupid game. I may be in Calcutta and watch it with friends. However, Sourav and his boys deserve a big hand. I have already done my bit by painting a huge bat that was auctioned at Rs 7 lakh. This amount has been contributed as 
scholarship to a young cricketer in Bangalore

l I will watch the match at home. My staff has made sure that my afternoon is free to cheer India. I feel Brett Lee is the most dangerous, though the entire Australian team is very good. Despite this I am confident the Indians will bring the Cup home. They have been playing wonderful cricket

	 I am definitely watching the World Cup final. I have cancelled all my appointments for Sunday to be free for the big occasion. Team India has brought smiles to the faces of millions of our countrymen over the past few weeks. I am sure the team will gladden our hearts on Sunday too. We will watch with bated breath and hope that Sourav Gangulys men in blue will repeat at the Wanderers what Kapils boys had achieved at Lords in 1983

 Im not interested in cricket. I will be watching an opera film Carmen instead. I grew up with too much cricket around me with my family members knowing too much about the intricacies of the game, while all I was interested in was painting and listening to music. So my reaction is actually a backlash to the family emotion

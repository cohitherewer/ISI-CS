 Klusener threatens to sue Smith
 Lance Klusener is on the offensive Durban: Discarded South African allrounder Lance Klusener has threatened to sue current national team captain Graeme Smith for branding him a disruptive element. In a letter to the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) sent by Kluseners attorney David Gush, the cricketer has threatened legal action against Smith for his remarks, according to the Johannesburg-based Sunday Times. Smith, now leading the South African team in England, made the remarks against Klusener just before the sides departure for the tour early in June. Klusener was subsequently left out of the tour, although he claims the Board had promised him a contract. The allrounder has now taken his case to the state-established Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), which deals with unfair labour practices. According to Kluseners attorney, the cricketers case will deal with the renewal of his contract. He claimed Klusener was led to believe that his contract would be renewed and it was for this reason the cricketer did not take up lucrative offers elsewhere. Gush said Klusener still wanted to play for South Africa. The 31-year-old claimed the UCBSA had told him he was being rested for the tour to Bangladesh and was promised a contract in time for South Africas Test series against England. Klusener did not seek any County contracts under the impression he would be re-employed by South Africa, only to find himself in the omitted list again. (PTI)  Copyright

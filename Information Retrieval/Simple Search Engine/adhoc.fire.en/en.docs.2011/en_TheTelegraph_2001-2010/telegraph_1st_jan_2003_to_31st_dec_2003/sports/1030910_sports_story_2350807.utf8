The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inzy sets eyes on 10,000 
Multan: Pakistans stand-in captain Inzamam-ul-Haq set his sights on scoring 10,000 one-day International runs after passing the 9,000 mark on Tuesday. I feel very good about completing the 9,000 runs today given the pressure I was under in recent months, Inzamam said after leading his side to a crushing 137-run victory over Bangladesh in the first match of the series. Now I am looking towards 10,000. The 33-year-old consolidated his position as the fifth highest run-scorer in ODI history during his unbeaten innings of 56 in his hometown Multan. Only Indias Sachin Tendulkar (12,219 runs) and Mohammed Azharuddin (9,378), and Sri Lankans Aravinda de Silva (9,284) and Sanath Jayasuriya (9,126) have scored more ODI runs than Inzamam. It has been an honour playing for so long for Pakistan and to reach this landmark when I am leading the side, he said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

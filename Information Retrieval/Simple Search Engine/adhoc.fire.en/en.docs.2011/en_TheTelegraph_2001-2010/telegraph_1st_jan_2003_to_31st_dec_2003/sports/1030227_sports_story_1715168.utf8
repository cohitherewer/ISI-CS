 Goan giants share honours 
Margao: A controversial 73rd minute-goal by substitute Sebastiao Endro helped Salgaocar hold Churchill Brothers 2-2 in a National League tie Wednesday. After Man of the Match Sunday Seah neutralised Benjamin Ansahs first half strike for Churchill, Yusif Yakubu helped them regain the lead. The draw put Salgaocar on 28 points from 16 matches, while Churchill are at 22 from as many matches. Churchills decision to bring in Benjamin in place of defender Osumanu Husseini, gave their attack more thrust. JCT down ITI 3-0 In Ludhiana, JCT Phagwara scored a facile 3-0 win over ITI Bangalore. Hardip Saini, Jaswinder and K. scored. After this victory, JCT are fourth in the standings with 27 points while ITI are at the bottom with four. (PTI)  Copyright

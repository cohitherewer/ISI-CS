The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jadejas plea rejected
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Thursday virtually rejected Ajay Jadejas plea for permission to take part in the super six cricket tournament in Honk Kong, starting from November 1. However, the court issued a notice to BCCI on Jadejas application seeking its reply by December 3. BCCI counsel Kapil Sibal opposed Jadejas plea on the ground that it would amount to lifting the ban imposed on the cricketer in the wake of match-fixing allegation against him.  (PTI)  Copyright

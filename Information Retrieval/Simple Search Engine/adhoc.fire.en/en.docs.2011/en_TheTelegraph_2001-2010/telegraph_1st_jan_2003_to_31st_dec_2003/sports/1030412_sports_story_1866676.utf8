The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gangjee, Vijay in final
 GANGJEE New Delhi: An indisposed Arjun Atwal conceded his match against Vijay Kumar to send the fifth seed into the final along with Rahil Gangjee at the Rs 10 lakh SRF golf championship Friday. Gangjee, the Calcutta professional, overcame S.S.P. Chowrasia 2-1 on the penultimate day of this matchplay tournament  the only leg of the Hero Honda Tour played under this format. Atwal, the top seed, withdrew because of heat stroke. The two-time European PGA Tour winner, who won a thriller against Jaiveer Virk Thursday, started feeling bad this morning. Atwals vocal chords have been worst affected because of which he has lost his voice temporarily. He may require a minor surgery if it does not get better by Saturday. He threw up several times and was in no shape to play. The doctors think it is the combination of the medicines he is taking for a throat infection and the heat, informed Amandeep Johl. Gangjee got the better of a fighting Chowrasia. After going three-up at the turn, Gangjee saw his lead cut to one when Chowrasia made a birdie on the 13th and then won the 14th with a par. Chowrasia could have squared the match had he not missed what seemed a simple six-footer birdie putt on the par-three 12th. You just cannot relax against someone like Chowrasia. I think the turning point was the 16th hole when I holed a three-footer for birdie and his birdie putt from 12 feet went out, said Gangjee. I would have loved to go out against Arjun, my idol, Gangjee said when asked about the final. The final will be a 36-hole affair. With the withdrawal of Atwal, the third-fourth place play-off has been abandoned. Chowrasia will be third and Atwal fourth. Chowrasia will receive Rs 50,000, while Atwal will pocket Rs 35,000.

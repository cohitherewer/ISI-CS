The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nandita, Raman champions
 Nandita Saha, who upset Mouma Das Bangalore: Nandita Saha of the Railways Sports Control Board caused a major upset en route to the womens title in the Mayors Cup all-India table tennis championship here when she beat top seed Mouma Das 4-0. The 19-year-old from Siliguri posted a convincing 11-7, 12-10, 12-10, 11-8 win over Petroleum Sports Promotion Boards Das. Saha made a good start and barring some anxious moments in the second and third set, never really allowed her rival to dominate. In the mens section, top seed and national champion S. Raman (PSPB) lived up o his billing when he quelled a late surge from compatriot Sharat Kamal and beat him 11-3, 11-9, 12-10, 5-11, 10-12, 13-11 to the title. Raman seemed to have it easy when he clinched three consecutive sets. However, Kamal, known for aggressive play, bounced back and took the next two. Raman then banked upon a defensive strategy, ensuring that the ball never rose high for his opponent to take advantage and wrapped up the fifth set. In the semi-finals played earlier, Das had beaten compatriot T. Pradeep 4-3 (11-9, 11-7, 6-11, 7-11, 11-8, 6-11, 11-7), while Saha had got the better of PSPBs Mantu Ghosh 11-5, 13-11, 11-6, 13-11. In the mens semi-finals, Raman fought hard to beat Ranbir Das (RSCB) 4-3 (7-11, 7-11, 11-6, 6-11, 11-4, 11-8, 11-5). In the other semi-final, Kamal outclassed S. Chakraborthy (RSCB) 11-6, 11-7, 12-10, 11-8.  (PTI)  Copyright

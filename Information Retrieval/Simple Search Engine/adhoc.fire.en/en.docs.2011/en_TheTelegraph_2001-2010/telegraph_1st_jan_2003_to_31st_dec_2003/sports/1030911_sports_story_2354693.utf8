The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, September 11, 2003  Calamint tames opposition 
 BY STAR RACER Calamint Calamint(astride C. Alford)  winning the Hovercraft Cup at the RCTC on Wednesday.  Picture by Kishor Roy Choudhury Calcutta: It was Calamint all the way in the 1,400m Hovercraft Cup, the main event in Wednesdays race card. The Vijay Singh-trained mare was cleverly ridden by C. Alford, who had her settled upfront only about a length clear of Smart Ruler. Lockers Park and the rest followed close behind until the home turn. Given a free run, up in the final stretch, the Gold Discovery-Tamarisca daughter went skating clear of the opposition, prompting her jockey to apply brakes a long way from home. Yet she finished a shade under five lengths clear of Smart Ruler who was hard-pressed to stop Lockers Park for the minor placings.				 										Earlier in the Best Of All Cup, Vijays hot-favourite, Thrilling Proposal was tested to the fullest before the three-year-old beat Grecian Prince. Trainer Daniel David and the visiting jockey K. Suresh also combined to notch up a double each through Secret Force and Bright And Clear.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

 Azhars charge
Hyderabad: Former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin on Monday charged that the then BCCI chief A.C. Muthiah and K. Madhavan, who headed the inquiry into match-fixing, ruined his career because of personal ill-will. Azharuddins counsel told a city court that his client had been victimised and was not given any opportunity to put across his case. (PTI)  Copyright

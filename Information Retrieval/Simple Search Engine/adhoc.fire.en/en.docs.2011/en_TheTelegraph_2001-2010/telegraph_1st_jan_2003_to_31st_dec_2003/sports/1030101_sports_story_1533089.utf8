		 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 NZ ignore ICC deadline
																								Auckland: New Zealand Cricket officials Tuesday said they would fail to meet the deadline for naming World Cup squads but expected no repercussions from the sports governing body.																								The ICC imposed a deadline of midnight on December 31 in England, for the announcement of the 14 teams which will compete at the World Cup.																								The deadline passes in New Zealand at 1 pm on January 1, an hour before New Zealand begin the third of seven ODIs against India. New Zealand officials said their squad would be finalised and a team list sent to the ICC after that match.																								NZC chief executive Martin Snedden said he expected no problems from the ICC over the late naming of the squad because January 1 was a public holiday in New Zealand. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 Md. Sporting held by TFA
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi: It was the day of the underdogs at the 115th Pepsi Durand Cup football tournament on Friday. While rusty and predictable Mohammedan Sporting were held 1-1 by a spirited Tata Football Academy (TFA) in a group A league match, in group C Vasco Sports Club, Goa, were upset 0-1 by Army XI. 																								After the days matches both Vasco and TFA have been eliminated from the tournament. Mohammedan Sportings display today was as gloomy as the weather. Their defence was shaky, midfield inconsistent and approach play predictable. Also skipper Hussein Mustafi was shown the red card (two yellows) in the 89th minute and will miss the tie against JCT on Sunday.																								In the fourth minute, Reazuls down-the-line pass split the TFA defence. Syed Rahim Nabi flicked over advancing the custodian and was helped in by Seriki. A minute before half time TFA equalised through Sumit Thapa .																								TEAMS																								Mohammedan Sporting: Prasanta Dora(Imran Khan 22), Reazul Musatfi, Insan ali, Hussain Mustafi (captain), Amandeep Singh, Syed Rahim Nabi, Amit Das, Habib Adekunle, Khemtang Paite (Arjan Ali 56), Abdulateef Seriki, Dipendu Biswas.

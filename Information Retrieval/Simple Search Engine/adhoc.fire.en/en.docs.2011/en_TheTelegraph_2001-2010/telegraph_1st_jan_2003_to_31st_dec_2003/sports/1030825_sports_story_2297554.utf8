 Hameed equals record in Pak win
 Yasir Hameed after scoring century on Sunday Karachi: A twin hundred by debutant Yasir Hameed inspired Pakistan to a seven-wicket win over Bangladesh in the first Test at Karachis National Stadium on Sunday. The 25-year-old from Peshawar became only the second batsman in Test crickets 128-year history to hit two hundreds in his first Test, following West Indian Lawrence Rowes 214 and an unbeaten 100 against New Zealand at Kingston in 1971-72. Hameed, who reached 170 in the first innings, batted imperiously to lead Pakistans successful chase of a 217-run target and inflict yet another defeat on Bangladesh. With the win, Pakistan also celebrated international crickets return to the country where foreign teams refusal to play over security fears caused a 15-month cricket drought. After steering left-armer Mohammad Rafique for two runs, Hameed became the fourth Pakistan player to score a century in each innings of a Test match  the 53rd time the feat has been achieved in all Test cricket. The other Pakistan players to have achieved the feat are Hanif Mohammed, Javed Miandad and Wajahatullah Wasti. But the promising one-drop batsman missed an armer from Rafique in the next over and was bowled for 105 after 229 minutes at the crease after consuming 161 balls with 15 boundaries, leaving Pakistan needing another 47 runs to carry the day. Inzamam-ul Haq and Yousuf Youhana unbeaten on 35 and15, respectively, ran an over throw on the last ball before lunch for the winning run to leave Bangladesh with their 21st defeat in 22 Tests since they gained Test status three years ago. The newcomers can however look back at the match with some consolation having shown significant improvement in their standard of play. They fought hard to take the Test into the final day, only the third time they have lasted five days of a Test, and can boast of Habibul Bashars batting of 71 and 108. Pakistan resumed at a commanding position of 112-1 on Sunday and added another 32 runs before losing opener Moahmamad Hafeez to Rafique for a stubborn 50. A Hameed-Hafeez stand yielded 134 for the second wicket, erasing Pakistans best second wicket stand of 87 between Taufeeq Umar and Younis Khan at Chittagong last year. Rafique was the pick of Bangladesh bowlers with two wickets. (AFP)  Copyright

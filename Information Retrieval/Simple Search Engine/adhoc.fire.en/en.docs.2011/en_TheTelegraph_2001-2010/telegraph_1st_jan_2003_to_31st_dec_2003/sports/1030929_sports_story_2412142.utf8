(PTI) Bangalore: Bengals Hari Sankar Roy clinched a gold for Bengal in mens high jump, while Saraswati Saha of Railways emerged the fastest woman on the opening day of the 43rd Open National athletics on Sunday. The day was also marked by the feat of Tamil Nadus V.S. Sureka, who created a national record in the womens pole-vault with an effort of 3.51 metres. At the Sree Kanteerava Stadium, Hari Sankar jumped 2.12 metres to claim the top spot, while Tamil Nadus Benedict Strity (who also had jumped to a 2.12m high) and Services M. Lorens (2.09) had to be satisfied with silver and bronze, respectively. Saraswati, on the other hand, was a runaway winner in her event. Her gold-winning timing of 11.70 seconds was well ahead of Keralas Greeshma (12.09) and Railways Rakhi Saha (12.17). Meanwhile, continuing from her good form at the recent inter-state meet in Jamshedpur where she finished first, the 19-year-old from Chennai Sureka shattered the 3.45 metres mark set at New Delhi last year by Karamjit Kaur (Police). Faring below her best here, Karamjit had to be satisfied in sharing silver with Suman of Haryana, both coming out with an identical 3.30m in the event. Busan Asian Games gold medallist Sunita Rani ran away with gold in 1500 metres but with a lower-than-expected performance, timing 4:17.57s, much below than her own national record breaking effort of 4:06.03 in the South Korean city. Karnatakas little-known sprinter Vilas Nilagund, in a burst of 10.70 seconds, grabbed the gold in mens 100m, pushing back the challenge of Piyush Kumar of Railways (10.73) and LICs Sandeep Sarkaria (10.76).

 Shons run ends 
 Koreas Shon Seung-mo after beating Chen Hong of China on Friday. (AFP) Birmingham, Aug. 2 (Reuters): South Korean Shon Seung-mo, the man who beat top seed and world No. 1 Chen Hong in an epic quarter-final at the world badminton championships, bowed out tamely in Saturdays semi-finals. Looking jaded, Shon lost 4-15, 5-15 to ninth seed Wong Choong Hann of Malaysia. In Fridays encounter with Chen, the top-rated Chinese, Shon, seeded 13, had saved a match point in the second set before battling through to a three-set triumph in an 85-minute 5-15, 17-14, 15-9 roller-coaster. A little over 12 hours later the Korean was back at the National Indoor Arena but there was to be no repeat, Wong sweeping into Sundays final in 47 minutes. He now meets fifth seed Xia Xuanze who disposed of unseeded Chinese compatriot Bao Chunlai 15-11, 15-7 in a well-fought 45-minute clash. Wong, last years China Open winner, is the first Malaysian to reach a mens singles final at a world championships. In the womens singles, defending champion Gong Ruina beat fellow Chinese Zhou Mi 11-2, 11-4 and will meet compatriot Zhang Ning who beat Hollands Mia Audina Tjiptawan 11-7, 11-0 .  Copyright

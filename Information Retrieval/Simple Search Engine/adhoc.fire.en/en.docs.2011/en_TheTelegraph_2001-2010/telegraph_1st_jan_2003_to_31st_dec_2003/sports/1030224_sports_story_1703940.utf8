The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Birmingham beat Liverpool
London: Michael Owen ended an eight-match scoring drought but Liverpools indifferent form continued as they slumped to a 1-2 defeat at Birmingham City in Sundays Premier League game. Perhaps mindful of Thursdays Uefa Cup game against AJ Auxerre, the Liverpool coach started with Owen on the substitutes bench. But Liverpool again looked lacklustre and Birmingham profited. Liverpool stay seventh on 43, five points adrift of the Champions League qualification places.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

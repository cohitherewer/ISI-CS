 Adams triggers Bangla collapse
Chittagong: Left-arm spinner Paul Adams exploited some below-par Bangladesh batting Thursday to take five wickets on his comeback and put South Africa firmly in control of the first Test. Adams, once described as having a frog in a blender bowling action and who had not played a Test for a year, took three wickets for one run in an 11-ball spell either side of tea as the home team collapsed from 97 for one to 173 all out. He said: I bowled a little quicker, tried to rush the Bangladesh batsmen and that paid off. South Africa, in reply, closed on 84 for two, with Herschelle Gibbs (17) and skipper Graeme Smith (16) the men out. The wicket should turn more as the match progresses and also get a bit up and down. Hopefully Ill manage another five in the second innings. Its great to be back in the side, especially after being out due to injury, said Adams. Bangladesh had begun well, but failed keep up the momentumreaching lunch on 78 for one after winning the toss.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

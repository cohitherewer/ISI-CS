 83-run lead for England

Having bowled out South Africa for 362 to secure a lead of 83, England lost Marcus Trescothick to the first ball of their second innings on Saturday. The hosts had looked likely to be in a far stronger position when James Kirtley claimed two wickets in the days first over to reduce the tourists to 88 for four. Neil McKenzie (90), Mark Boucher (48) and Shaun Pollock (62) brought South Africa back into the game.  Copyright

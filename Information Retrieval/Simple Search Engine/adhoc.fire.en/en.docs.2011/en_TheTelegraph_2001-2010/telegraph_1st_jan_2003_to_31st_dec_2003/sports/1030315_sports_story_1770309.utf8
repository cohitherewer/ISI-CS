 Gilchrist for Ponting at Test helm
Durban: Adam Gilchrist Friday ruled himself out as a future Australia Test captain and backed World Cup skipper Ricky Ponting to be the long-term successor to Steve Waugh. Gilchrist, who has deputised as captain in Test matches, insisted that should Waugh decide to call it a day he would throw his support behind Ponting who has led the team to the semi-finals of the World Cup here. Ricky is the main man in line, whether it is now or later. Hes an outstanding captain, the 31-year-old Western Australia wicket-keeper added. Hes grown into the leadership role and hes obviously an option the selectors will have. Gilchrist said Australian squad, preparing for Saturdays Super Sixes clash against Kenya, were as keen as anyone to find out if Test captain Waugh intended to prolong his international career. A decision whether the 37-year-old Waugh will tour the West Indies next month will be made by Sunday when the party for the Caribbean tour is finalised. No ones talked to Tugga (Steve Waugh), explained Gilchrist. Its been discussed by the players here, not in a come on let us know sort of way but more like two guys sitting in a pub. Its a big decision either way. Looking ahead to the day-night encounter, Gilchrist said experience had taught Australia, unbeaten at the World Cup so far, not to underestimate the African minnows. Kenya have got great self-belief and team spirit. The last time we played them (in September when Australia won by five wickets) they gave us a real scare in Nairobi.  (AFP)  Copyright

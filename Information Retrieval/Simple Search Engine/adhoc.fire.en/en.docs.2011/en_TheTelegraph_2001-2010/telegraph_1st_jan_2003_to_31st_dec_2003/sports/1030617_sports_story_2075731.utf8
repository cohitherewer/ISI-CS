 Paki chant racist: Court
London: A football fan who chanted a word used to refer to Britons of Pakistani origin was guilty of a racist offence, the High Court ruled on Monday. In the first case of its kind to reach the High Court, two senior judges ruled that Sean Ratcliffe, 21, from Newcastle-Under-Lyme in central England, had violated the 1991 Football (Offences) Act. The judges said that the word Paki was a racially offensive comment. (AP)  Copyright

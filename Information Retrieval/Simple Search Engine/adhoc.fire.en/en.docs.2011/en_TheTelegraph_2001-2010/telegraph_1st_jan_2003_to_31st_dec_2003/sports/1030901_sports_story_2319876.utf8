				 																																	Derby: South African allrounder Jacques Kallis warmed up for next weeks fifth Test against England with the first double century of his career against Derbyshire on Saturday. Kallis made exactly 200 in the tourists total of 460 for seven declared although his runs did come against an under-strength Derbyshire attack.				 																																	In reply, the hosts made 136 for four declared with swing bowler Charl Willoughby taking three for 31.				 																																	There was little chance of a result in this three-day match after Thursdays opening day was completely washed out.				 																																	Kallis gave only one chance, when he was dropped at slip on 166. He surpassed his previous career-best 189 against Zimbabwe at Bulawayo in October 2001 with a six off Nathan Dumelow. He then swept the off-spinner for four to go to 200. But next ball he top-edged Dumelow to Chris Bassano at cover. Kallis faced 305 balls hitting one six and 27 fours. 				 																																	Chennai: TNCA XI clinched the Sahara Buchi Babu Memorial Trophy defeating Indian Airlines, New Delhi, by 126 runs on the third and final day on Sunday.				 																																	The hosts, 138 for two overnight, added 63 runs in 13.1 overs, leaving Indian Airlines with a target of 295 in 45 overs. They could only muster 168 before being all out. 				 																																	TNCA was helped by Norul Riaz, who top-scored with 70 and wicketkeeper-batsman, Dinesh Kartik (32). The two added 70 runs for the third wicket in 16.4 overs. 				 																																	Medium pacer Munaf Patel of Indian Airlines, who took two for 48, finished with a match haul of nine for 126.

Nandrajog has been given top billing in the under-19 group, while local lad Parth Sharma is the top seed in under-15 boys category. 				 																																	Madrid: French midfielder Claude Makelele on Sunday threw a spanner in the works over this 24 million euro ($26.2 million) transfer to English Premiership side Chelsea following another financial dispute with current club Real Madrid. 				 																																	Makeleles agent Marc Roger said that the deal had little chance of going ahead in time for Sundays midnight transfer deadline because Real are refusing to give the player his slice of the transfer fee. 				 																																	Paris: Monaco has signed Real Madrid striker Fernando Morientes on loan for the rest of the season, sports daily LEquipe reported on Sunday.				 																																	Morientes has been largely out of favour at Real since the arrival of Brazil World Cup winner Ronaldo at the start of last season.				 																																	Monaco will pay Morientes a monthly salary of $220,000, the report said.

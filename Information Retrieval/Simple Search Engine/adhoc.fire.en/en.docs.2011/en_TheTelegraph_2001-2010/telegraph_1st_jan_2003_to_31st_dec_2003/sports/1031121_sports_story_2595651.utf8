 US power into final
 - FED CUP l Lisa Raymond seals Belgian fate  Martina Navratilova and Lisa Raymond with the Stars and Stripes after winning the dead doubles rubber in the Fed Cup semi-final versus Belgium in Moscow on Thursday. (AFP) Moscow: Lisa Raymond powered the US into the Fed Cup final as she trounced Belgiums Elke Clijsters 6-2, 6-1 on Thursday to give her team an unassailable 3-1 lead in their semi-final. Within minutes of that crucial win, Raymond was back on court in partnership with Martina Navratilova, the American pair crushing Clijsters and Caroline Maes 6-1, 6-4 in the dead doubles rubber to complete a 4-1 victory. The Americans will face the winners of the second semi-final between hosts Russia and France, who were level at 1-1 after the first day. In Wednesdays opening match, Els Callens beat Meghann Shaughnessy 6-3, 7-6 to bring the Belgians,  who are missing their world No. 1 and 2 Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters  back into the tie. But Clijsters younger sister Elke, a late replacement for 17-year-old Kirsten Flipkens, could do nothing to stop in-form Raymond. The 30-year-old American, known more for her doubles prowess, produced another impressive display of power tennis following her 6-2, 6-1 demolition of Callens on Wednesday. Raymond, who had little trouble on her own serve, broke 18-year-old Clijsters twice in each set before closing out the match in just 47 minutes. I havent played a singles match since 1999, so it felt really good to play two solid matches here, said Raymond before praising her partner Navratilova, who improved her win-loss record in Fed Cup to 38-0 with Thursdays victory. Its pretty amazing to be on a court with her, she said. Its one thing to represent your country, but to do it with Martina is something else. Earlier, Callens rebounded with a solid effort against Shaughnessy, the world No. 17. The Belgian earned the only break in the second game to take the first set 6-3 before securing victory at her first opportunity, winning the tie-break 7-5. I definitely was a bit tired today, but Els played a good match and deserved her victory, she said. But we have a day off tomorrow and I think well be ready for whoever we play in the final and we feel confident to bring the cup home, Shaughnessy said. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sania, Bopanna herald new dawn 
 Bopanna put up a  heroic performance against Verkerk  Sania completed transition  from talent to champion materialNew Delhi: There was more than one ray of hope on the horizon but Indian tennis this year continued to look up to the old war horse for deliverance. Rohan Bopanna announced his arrival on the big stage with a courageous performance in the Davis Cup play-off while Sania Mirza, with her Wimbledon crown, marked the changing face of womens game in the country. Yet the entire nation looked up to one man for salvation. Leander Paes revied his sagging career with two Grand Slam titles with Martina Navratilova but without his magical inspiration, India stumbled for the fourth consecutive time at the play-off stage of the Davis Cup. The brain lesion that laid him low in the middle of the season brought out those fighting qualities in the man who has, time and again, pulled off miraculous victories for the country. Paes absence from the World Group qualifying tie proved to be a major handicap for India who went down 0-5 to The Netherlands. Nevertheless, India did unearth a hero at Zwolle. In one of the longest matches in Cup history since tie-break was introduced, Bopanna almost pulled the rug from under the feet of Martin Verkerk. Stretching a top-20 player to five sets was no mean achievement. And, ranked in the 400s, had Bopanna pulled it off  he lost the decider 12/10  it would have been a major feather in Bopannas cap. The Dutch had assembled their best team, and the matches were played on fast hard courts away from home. But, in the more than four hours he spent on court that Friday, Bopanna won many a heart with his fighting performance. In the end, it did not matter that he did not win  none expected him to  but his bold and aggressive play augured well for Indian tennis. After Bopannas marathon performance, Prakash Amritraj lost in straight sets to Sjeng Schalken. Well before his first match in Indian colours, the 19-year-old US-born Prakash had established himself as a name on the circuit. Having a famous surname does not help you win matches, does it? Prakash had asked with a smile after losing in a challenger event in India earlier in the year. Behind that smile was hidden attributes that helped him zoom from the 1000s to top-300 in ATP rankings. The attributes which were handed down to him from his famous father Vijay are a strong work ethic and dedication to the game. He returned to the same dusty courts two months later for the satellite circuit when he truly came, saw and conquered the competition and the hearts. Sanias transition from promising talent to champion material was complete when she won the Wimbledon girls doubles title. It was the first by an Indian girl and the first junior Grand Slam title in any discipline since Paes won the Wimbledon boys singles title in 1991. It took Sania to No. 3 in junior doubles rankings. Besides, the six ITF singles titles to her name proved that she was no flash in the pan. Just when it seemed Sania would leave the rest of the competition way behind her, Isha Lakhani stormed her way to be the highest-ranked Indian woman for the year. In 2004, the country will expect tennis to snatch a gold at the Olympics. But for that to happen, Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi will have to team up again. (PTI)  Copyright

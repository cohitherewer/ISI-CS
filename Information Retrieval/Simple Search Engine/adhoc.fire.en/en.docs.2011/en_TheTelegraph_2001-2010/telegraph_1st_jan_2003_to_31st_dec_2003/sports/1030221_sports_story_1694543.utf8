				 																																	Johannesburg: Dismissed for the lowest score in the history of one-day cricket, hapless Canada can take heart in knowing that even the greatest player of all time suffered similar embarrassments.				 																																	The Canadians record low of 36 against Sri Lanka in Paarl Wednesday meant the World Cup mismatch was over in less than two hours and had people questioning the rights of the smaller nations to be involved in the global showpiece.				 																																	But they can take heart from history  even the legendary Sir Donald Bradman sometimes got the blues. 				 																																	He was part of the Australia team which slumped to the heaviest Test defeat in history in 1938 when England swept to an innings and 579 win at The Oval. Bradmans misery was compounded by a broken ankle.				 																																	Johannesburg: West Indies Ricardo Powell has thrown up a challenge to Pakistans Shahid Afridi and Indias Virender Sehwag by joining the elite club of players with a strike rate of more than 100 in the World Cup.				 																																	After scoring 50 off just 31 balls in the West Indies match against Bangladesh Tuesday, Powell boosted his scoring rate to 101.27 runs per hundred balls. Among current players, the only other man who can boast of a three-figure strike-rate is Afridi whose No.1 position is under threat after making just one in his only innings of the meet so far, against Australia, which dropped his rate to 101.65. 				 																																	Sehwags rate has dropped after an indifferent start to the meet but he is still next in line to join the club, on 99.28. 				 																																	Harare: The mayor of Harare has boycotted World Cup matches in the city because his official invitation from the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) made him feel like a criminal, a local newspaper reported on Thursday. Mayor Engineer Elias Mudzuri took exception to a paragraph in the invitation warning he could be searched for alcohol, chairs, umbrellas, anything that can be classed as a weapon, anything that is going to make a noise, such as a firecracker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I wouldnt be doing my job if I didnt chase 381: Matthew Hayden
 - Nowadays, players are fitter and stronger... Moreover, they dont shy away from challenges...   FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Matthew Hayden is  keen to raise the bar to an even higher level  Mumbai, Nov. 1: Less than  a month after landing crickets prized crown, Matthew Hayden  has revealed he will be seeking to better his own record-smashing  380 (the numero uno individual Test score). Hayden said  so during an interaction with The Telegraph  perhaps his  first one-on-one on the current tour  late last evening.  Speaking at The Taj poolside, the genial left-hander  remarked: Basically, youve got to set yourself up and  try to break your own record... Indeed, I wouldnt be doing  my job if I didnt chase it whenever the opportunity comes  along. Of course, I accept the game situation must be such  to facilitate that. In between signing autographs and obliging fans desperate for a photograph with Australias newest icon, Hayden added: Looking back on that Perth innings (against Zimbabwe), I was fortunate to get into a situation whereby I could move towards bettering (Brian) Laras 375...I didnt set out to, but... Is there a fear that somebody may push him to No. 2? Haydens response was quicker than the fastest on offer from a Shoaib Akhtar or a Brett Lee: No, theres no fear... No worry, either... I suppose somebody will get to 381... But, then, as Ive told you, I wouldnt be doing my job if I didnt chase it myself... Grinning, he continued: In any case, nowadays, players are fitter and stronger... They can spend hours at the crease... Moreover, they dont shy away from challenges... In fact, there are quite a few who could do one better  only, it will probably be somebody from the top order... Asked whether he would now be gunning for Saeed Anwars ODI record (194 versus India in Chennai, 1996-97), Hayden answered: You would always give yourself a chance... However, because of the boundaries, it wont be possible in Australia... To my mind, the sub-continent is more suited for having a crack... Well, thats a warning from a hungry and fiercely determined 32-year-old... Incidentally, Haydens point about the sub-continent being more conducive to jumbo one-day scores is borne out by facts: Four of the top five innings have been authored in either the sub-continent or Sharjah, which is just a couple of hours away. The one exception is Sir Viv Richards 189 not out in Manchester (1984). Postscript: This has nothing to do with records, but Hayden believes in taking in as much of the sights and sounds on tour as possible. As much of the cuisine, too. So, towards that end, he joined the chef of a high-profile restaurant (during a promo tour yesterday) for a first-hand feel and taste of desi preparations.  Hayden quite enjoyed that experience.

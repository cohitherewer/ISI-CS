The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barreto at it again 
- Super division l Mohun Bagans 1-0 victory reflects motivation problems  BY A STAFF REPORTER Jose Ramirez Barreto after scoring the matchwinner on Thursday. Picture by Pradip Sanyal Calcutta: Bhratri Sangha arent the team to beat in this years Calcutta Football Leagues Super Division. But they are surely a team to learn from. If short on talent, Sishir Ghoshs wards make up with a great deal of courage and attrition. That Mohun Bagan were able to manage just a one-goal win Thursday  notwithstanding the many misses  is a commentary on this. The goal came in the 45th minute of the match, Jose Ramirez Barreto making up for messing up a similar situation earlier in the match. Ashim Biswas was introduced in the 36th minute, but he did not make much of a difference. Maybe this just wasnt his day, or maybe its this old knee injury that is rearing its head  the reason why coach Aloke Mukherjee thought it would be wise to try and keep him on the bench as much as possible.Also sadly missing from the Bagan halfline was that old flair from Basudeb Mondal. Concern is that this might just be his last star team season. Biswas replaced Mondal and played a little withdrawn, till Barreto left after a minor first-half injury. In the 15th minute Barretos attempt from close, off a Palash Karmakar tap was saved almost on the goalline by Bhratris Seikh Sikandar. Three minutes later, off a Barreto-Marcos Parreira exchange, Hardeep Gill took over 30 yards off, and his fine powerful volley was as brilliantly saved by Bhratri goalkeeper Binod Mullick.Gill does make a difference in the half line, but Thursday the overall set-up looked pretty ruffled. There was a great deal misdirected energy and mispasses were the order of the day as were the long balls. In the 43rd minute Barreto picked up the ball at the top of the Bhratri defensive third and ran unchallenged, finding himself with only the goalkeeper to beat and he faltered.That he made up for two minutes later when he reached the top of the box off a Marcos tap. Goalkeeper Mullick dived, but the Brazilian chipped it over him and then followed through for a fine volley into the netting.The second half was a story of misses, twice by Marcos then by Biswas and there were more last-minute saves and more mispasses. Football wasnt at its best, but what worries is that maybe there is probably a motivation problem in Bagan.TEAMSMohun Bagan: Imran Khan, Palash Karmakar, Insan Ali, Debkumar Sashmal, Babun Kar, Rennedy Singh, Basudeb Mondal (Ashim Biswas, 36), Hardeep Gill, Mehtab Hossain, Jose Ramirez Barreto (Rocus Lemere, 46), Marcos Parreira.Bhratri Sangha: Binod Mullick, Subhas Das (Abhijit Dalal, 72), Osto Karar, Amritalal Biswas, Seikh Sikandar, Swapan Munda (Manoharan, 60), Debu Pradhan, Gautam Naha (Manoj Singh, 79), Ranjan Sarkar, Ohidul Islam, Sanjib Sashmal.Referee: Ashis Das.Dutta taken ill Ever-Ready coach Amal Dutta was admitted to a city nursing home late Wednesday after complaining of chest pain.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC discusses 16-team 2007 World Cup
 - BCCI wants Player Terms redrawn for 04 Champions Trophy  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Rameez Raja and Sunil Gavaskar exchange views in Mumbai on Thursday Mumbai: Despite criticism over the quality of some matches, featuring the lowly-ranked teams in this years World Cup, the International Cricket Council (ICC) seems inclined to add two more emerging nations in the tournaments 2007 edition in the West Indies. Nothing has been finalised, but there is much support for a 16-team World Cup in four years time... Its another matter that the quality may well suffer, well-placed sources told The Telegraph on Thursday evening, at the end of Day I of the Cricket Committee-Management meeting. Apparently, those in favour of adding emerging nations feel that the development programme and the heavy funding wont mean anything if the teams dont get exposure at the highest level. But, clearly, thats just one side of the coin... If a 16-team tournament gets the nod, we will have the Super Eight stage instead of the Super Six and logistics could become a bigger headache. Incidentally, the ICC is open to the idea of staging a few games in Canada. That goes with the globalisation bit. As expected, discussions on the next World Cup took up much time, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had the opportunity to insist on the contentious Player Terms being redrawn for the 2004 Champions Trophy (England). One understands a top BCCI functionary and a senior ICC official will thrash things out. The BCCI has also made it clear that the proposed Super Series (set to be introduced from 2005) should not have the controversy-sparking Player Terms. Towards the end of the day, the issue of recognising the Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) came up for discussion. Irrespective of the past, a majority of the Test-playing nations have said they have no problems in dealing with that body. Indias stand is very different but, it seems, Fica will now be more acceptable. At this moment, though, its a sensitive issue. The meeting concludes on Friday afternoon. Thereafter, continuing with the parleys-on- the-sidelines will take up all of ICC chief Ehsan Manis time. In any case, president Jagmohan Dalmiya has already reminded him about the BCCIs stand on the guarantee money for this years World Cup being withheld. Dalmiya is expected to meet Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Rameez Raja as well. It wasnt for any great length of time, but Rameez and BCCI secretary S.K.Nair  both of whom are delegates at the two-day meeting  did have a tete-a-tete on Thursday itself. Ive been assured that everything points to Team India being allowed to tour Pakistan next February, Rameez, a former captain, informed.  Copyright

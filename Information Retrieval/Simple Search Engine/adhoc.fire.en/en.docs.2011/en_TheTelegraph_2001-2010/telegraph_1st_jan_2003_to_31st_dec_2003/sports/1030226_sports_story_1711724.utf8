				 																																	Kimberley: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming wants the ICC to consider introducing reserve days at the next World Cup for rain-affected matches. 				 																																	There are no reserve days at this World Cup, with teams sharing the points when games are abandoned, as happened in last weeks Group B clash between West Indies and Bangladesh.				 																																	I would like to have seen, in hindsight, reserve days because that could have a huge bearing on the World Cup and Im sure the organisers dont want that, Fleming said.				 																																	The logistics of that, Im not sure about because Im speaking in general terms, but it can have an effect which I think is unfair.				 																																	It can be noted that Indian captain Sourav Ganguly had also asked for a reserve day in the ongoing tournament.				 																																	Fleming also supported ICCs decision to increase the number of developing nations. 				 																																	Sydney: Steve Waugh says Shane Warnes 12-month suspension will be more like a 15-month ban because he would need at least three months of match practice to play international cricket again.				 																																	The Australian Test captain said people were forgetting Warne would not have played any competitive cricket during his suspension for taking a banned diuretic pill.				 																																	But Steve told a Sydney radio station on Tuesday that only Warne, 33, would know how long it would take to get back up to world standard after such a lay off.				 																																	Steve noted the next major tour following the end of Warnes suspension was India in September next year.				 																																	The ACB chief executive James Sutherland has said a decision on whether to allow Warne to train with the Victorian and Australian sides during his exile had not yet been made.				 																																	Johannesburg: New Zealand Cricket chiefs on Tuesday delayed releasing the results of their inquiry into the teams infamous Durban nightclub brawl.				 																																	The fracas at the Tiger, Tiger Club in the early hours of Friday morning left star allrounder Chris Cairns with a cut lip after the incident.				 																																	The incident reportedly took place when some players removed their shirts and danced the haka, the Maori war dance associated with the countrys All Blacks rugby team. A spokesman for NZC said that the findings would now be released on Wednesday  when the Black Caps face Bangladesh in Kimberley.				 																																	Team manager Jeff Crowe forwarded his report about the incident to NZC on Monday, but chief executive Martin Snedden delayed its release to clarify some points.				 																																	Johannesburg: More than 9,000 runs have been scored at the 2003 cricket World Cup but for South Africans every one of them pales into insignificance when conversations turn to The Run.				 																																	The country still seems to be traumatised by the memory of that four-year-old, incomplete 22 yards, the run that got away and cost the team a place in the 1999 World Cup final in England.				 																																	The mid-wicket mix-up between Lance Klusener and Allan Donald at Edgbaston, leading to a semi-final tie with Australia, appears to bubble to the surface of the collective South African consciousness on an almost daily basis. The newspapers were back at Edgbaston over the weekend.				 																																	Its as if theres a national psyche hell-bent on searching for that one run, the Sunday Times said. The incident has been turned into a form of self-flagellation.				 																																	n India vs England, live from 6.00 pm on SET Max and 5.30 pm on DD-1 n New Zealand vs Bangladesh, live from 1.30 pm on Sony

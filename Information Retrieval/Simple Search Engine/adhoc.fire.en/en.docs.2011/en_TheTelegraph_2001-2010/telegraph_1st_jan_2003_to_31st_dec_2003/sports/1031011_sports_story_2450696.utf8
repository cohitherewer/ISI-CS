 Ramesh clinches title
 - Harikrishna loses in final round to finish eighth  Ramesh won by virtue of a better progressive score New Delhi: R. B. Ramesh won the Parsvanth International Chess tournament defeating Sriram Jha in the final round on Friday. The Chennai-based player, who gained his third and final GM norm in the 11-round tournament, finished on nine points with Russian GM Alexander Fominyh and GM Marat Dzhumaev of Uzbekistan, but was declared winner on the basis of better progressive score. Ramesh opted for Sicilian opening against Jha and reached a winning position by the 18th move, finishing things off by the 30th. But the biggest loser was overnight joint leader P. Harikrishna, who went down to Dzhumaev to finish eighth. Harikrishna looked on course for a victory but faltered at crucial moments to hand over the initiative. Another overnight leader Fominyh had no such blues en route to his 48-move victory against GM Tahir Vakhidov of Uzbekistan. IM Neelotpal Das (8.5) finished a creditable fourth beating GM Jonathan Rowson of Scotland. Neelotpal, playing black, opted for the Petroff Defence to win in style. Surya Sekhar Ganguly also finished on 8.5, but had to be satisfied with the seventh position. GM Koneru Humpy, who had a disastrous tournament, finished joint 49th along with Amardeep Bartakke and Vedant Goswami. STANDINGS 1-3: R.B. Ramesh, A. Fominyh, M. Dzhumaev, 4-7: Neelotpal Das, S. Iuldachev, Surya Sekhar Ganguly, S. Ovsejevitsch, 8-13: P. Harikrishna, D. Svetushkin, Lanka Ravi, R. Shetty, S. Poobesh Anand, Deep Sengupta.  (PTI)  Copyright

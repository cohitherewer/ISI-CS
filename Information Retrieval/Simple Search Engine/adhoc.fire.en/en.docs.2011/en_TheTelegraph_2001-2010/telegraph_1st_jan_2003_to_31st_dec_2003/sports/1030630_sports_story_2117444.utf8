 Mallorca Kings of Spain
 Real Mallorca players celebrate their 3-0 victory in Elche Saturday. (Reuters) Elche: Cameroon striker Samuel Etoo played a starring role in Real Mallorcas first Kings Cup success as he grabbed two superbly struck goals that helped his side to a 3-0 win over Recreativo Huelva in Saturdays final. The win means that the islanders, who beat Real Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna on their way to the final, now join Valencia and Barcelona to complete Spains trio of representatives in next seasons Uefa Cup. Uruguayan striker Walter Pandiani put the islanders ahead on 21 minutes when he smashed home a penalty after Etoo was hauled down on the goal line by Recreativo defender Loren. Man of the Match Etoo, who flew to Paris on Sunday morning to play for Cameroon in the Confederations Cup final against hosts France, then struck twice late in the second half to wrap up the victory. The young striker dedicated the victory to fellow Cameroon international Marc Vivien-Foe, who collapsed during Thursdays Confederations Cup semi-final win over Colombia and died shortly afterwards. It was a very special win because of what happened this week, he told Spanish television. I have got a teammate who is now sitting up there beside God and this victory is for him. Coach Gregorio Manzano said he was delighted with his teams performance. It was third-time lucky for the Real Mallorca who finished as runners-up in their previous two Cup final appearances, losing out 1-0 to Atletico Madrid in 1991 and then in a penalty shootout to Barcelona in 1998. For Recreativo it was a disappointing end to a season in which they were also relegated to division two after just one campaign in the top flight. Recreativo started the match in promising fashion but struggled to cope with the islanders pacy attack and Mallorcas opener followed a slick passing move just after the 20-minute mark. Argentine midfielder Ariel Ibagaza carved open the Recreativo defence with a sharp ball down the left wing to Pandiani, who clipped a teasing cross towards strike partner Etoo. But before the Cameroon international could make contact he was hauled down by Recreativo defender Loren on the goal line. Pandiani stepped up to take the penalty and sent goalkeeper Luque the wrong way to the delight of the 15,000 Mallorca fans packed into one end of the Martinez Valero Stadium. Recreativo had the ball in the net in the final minute of the half when substitute Xisco headed home at the far post, but the effort was ruled out for a foul by the pocket-sized striker. The Andalucians continued to push hard for an equaliser after the restart but were unable to cope as Mallorca made the most of the gaps they left at the back. Etoo made certain of victory by grabbing a late double. Etoo left the pitch to a standing ovation when he substituted just before the final whistle.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CWealth champion tests positive
New Delhi: Shailaja Pujari, a gold medal winner at last years Manchester Commonwealth Games, has tested positive. Shailaja has tested positive for a steroid, Balbir Bhatia, secretary of the Weightlifting Federation of India, said Wednesday. Shailaja, who won the womens up to 75 kg gold in Manchester, tested positive at a junior national meet in January and was not selected for a recent championship in Tonga following the outcome, he said. The federation has yet to decide on the level of punishment as Pujari had also tested positive for an anabolic steroid during domestic trials in 2000, Bhatia said. Shailajas B sample is yet to be tested. This revelation comes only days after the Indian Olympic Committee found 21 athletes, including seven lifters, guilty of doping at the National Games in December.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

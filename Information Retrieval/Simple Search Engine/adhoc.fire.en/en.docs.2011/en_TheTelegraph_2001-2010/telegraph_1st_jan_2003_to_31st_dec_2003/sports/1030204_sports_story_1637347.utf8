 Injury scare for Kallis, Gibbs
 Cape Town: South Africa allrounder Jacques Kallis and opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs were struck in the nets on Sunday but are expected to be fit for the World Cup opener against West Indies on February 9. Kallis was struck on his left big toe by a yorker from a net bowler and was taken for X-rays on Monday morning, which revealed deep bruising. He was fit enough to bat again during practice on Monday but did not bowl. Im not worried about it, said team physiotherapist Shane Jabbar. It wont keep him out of action this weekend. We will monitor it closely today and tomorrow. A decision will be taken on Tuesday as to whether Kallis will be fit for South Africas warm-up game against provincial side Boland in Paarl later in the day. Gibbs was struck on the right shoulder when he was early on a hook shot but he, too, suffered bruising only. He batted in the nets on Monday although he experienced some difficulty raising his right arm.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

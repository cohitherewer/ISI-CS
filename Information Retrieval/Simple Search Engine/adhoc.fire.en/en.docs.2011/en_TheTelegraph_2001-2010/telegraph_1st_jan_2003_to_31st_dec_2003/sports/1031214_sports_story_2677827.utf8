The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan volte-face on sacking Atanu
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Dec. 13: A day after releasing Atanu Bhattacharya as goalkeeping coach, Mohun Bagan officials on Saturday did a volte-face, saying the former international has been discharged from his duty temporarily. We have never said Atanu has been released from his job once and for all. The move is temporary and the decision was taken purely on the basis of discipline and the teams current run of performance, said a club official. We may even ask him to rejoin during the National Football League itself. Atanu could not be contacted for comment. Mohun Bagan officials held a meeting with coach Aloke Mukherjee, physical trainer Robson and senior player Jose Ramirez Barreto. While trying to put an end to the apparent ego-clash between Aloke and Robson, the officials also assigned the former the duty of training goalkeepers. The IFA has set up a five-member committee to look into matters related to East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmicks punishment for his anti-association comments. The committee will arrive at a decision within January 7, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said.  Bhowmick show cause After a governing body meeting, Dutta said that a show-cause letter would soon be issued on Bhowmick seeking explanation of his comments against the IFA. We have found Bhowmick guilty of making derogatory comments against the IFA. The disciplinary committee has been asked to frame charges and issue a show-cause letter, Dutta said. Bhowmick, before todays IFA meeting, had sought some time to explain his stand. Meanwhile, Brazilian recruit Christiano Junior joined East Bengal in a practice match on Saturday, but the coach didnt say anything on the new import.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Big win for Md. Sp.
Jamshedpur: Mohammedan Sporting almost ensured a place in the final phase of the second division of the National Football League Thursday with a 7-0 win over Manipur Police here Thursday. While Ghanaian Abeel Ibrahim scored three, Dipendu Biswas netted a brace with Rahim Nabi and Khemtang Paite scoring one each. Mohammedan Sporting need to draw their last game against Haywards SC Goa to advance to the final phase. Even if they lose, Titanium have to win by at least nine goals to stop the city team from qualifying. Dipendu opened scoring in the 16 minute while Ibrahim made it 2-0 three minutes hence. Nabi struck in the 40th minute and Ibrahim scored his second two minutes later. Ibrahim scored his third in the 55th minute while Dipendu and Paite piled on the Manipur teams woes in the 79th and 89 minutes, respectively. Meanwhile, Haywards SC, Goa, are also poised to move into the final leg as they thrashed Titanium, Kerala, 7-2 in another match. (Agencies)  Copyright

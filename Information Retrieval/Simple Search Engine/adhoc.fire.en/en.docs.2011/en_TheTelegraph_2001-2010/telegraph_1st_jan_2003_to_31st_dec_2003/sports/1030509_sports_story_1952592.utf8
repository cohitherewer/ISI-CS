 Imran favours immediate revival
Dubai: Hailing the resumption of diplomatic ties between New Delhi and Islamabad, former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has called for immediate revival of stalled cricketing relations between the arch-rivals. It is time for the two countries to play cricket against each other. Pakistan must invite India immediately and more importantly, India should accept the invitation, he said here on Wednesday. He said resumption of cricketing ties could go a long way in helping reduce tension between the two countries. Kashmir is the main issue and once it is sorted out, everything else will be all right he said.  Indias Sharjah stand Meanwhile, the Indian sports minister Vikram Verma said on Thursday that India was not averse to playing at the off-shore venue of Sharjah. We had taken a decision not to allow our team to play in Sharjah. But now if we are sufficiently convinced about the venue and if the International Cricket Council calendar stipulates for a fixture there or if there is an invitation, we will consider the possibility, he said.

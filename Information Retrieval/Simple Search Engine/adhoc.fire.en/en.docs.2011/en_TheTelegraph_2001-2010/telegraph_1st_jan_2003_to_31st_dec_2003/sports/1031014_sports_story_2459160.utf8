 Hayden all-time great: Steve
Perth: Skipper Steve Waugh Monday hailed Matthew Hayden as an all-time great after the openers world record 380 set up Australias innings and 175-run win over Zimbabwe. Australia won the series opener at the WACA before lunch on the last day when the tourists were bowled out for 321 after being forced to follow-on. Inspired by Haydens 10-hour innings, Australia hit a mountainous 735 for six declared in just five sessions. Then they bowled out the Africans for 239 to take control of the match. Man of the Match Hayden toppled West Indian Brian Laras 375 for the highest individual Test innings. Hes a great player, said Waugh. Hell go down as one of the all-time greats, no doubt about that. Mattys was a phenomenal innings, added Waugh, who declared when Haydens wicket fell. It was great to just watch. When you watch him bat you think, I cant believe anyone can bat any better than this.

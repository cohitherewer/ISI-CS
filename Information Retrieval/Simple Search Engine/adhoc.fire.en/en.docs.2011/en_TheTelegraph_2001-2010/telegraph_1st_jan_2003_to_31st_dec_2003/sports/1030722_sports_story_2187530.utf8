 Pankaj stays on winning track
Taupo: National champion Pankaj Advani notched his fourth straight victory, but fellow Indians, Aditya Mehta and Saurav Kothari, crashed to defeats as the IBSF world under-21 snooker championship reached the final stages on Monday. Pankaj smoothly moved past Adam Kinghorn of Australia with a 4-1 (40-51, 112-12, 77-32, 67-61, 64-19) scoreline to remain the only unbeaten player in the seven-man group F and is almost certain to advance to the knockout stage that comprises top four players from each of the eight groups. The 18-year-old from Bangalore, with two more matches in hand, is ahead of Albert Kenny of Ireland and Jamie ONeill of England, who have four wins from five outings. The fourth contender from this group is Nisar Ahmed Saif of Qatar who has won three of his five matches. Aditya, who had won all four previous matches in group D, tasted his first defeat when he went down to Tain Pengfei of China 1-4 (11-94, 19-80, 38-71, 75-30, 43-72). The Chinese player had two good breaks of 66 and 52. Despite the loss, Aditya remains in contention for a berth in the round of 32 with a 4-1 win-loss record as against Mark Allens (Northern Ireland) 5-5, Pengfeis 5-4 and Jamie Jones (Wales) 6-3. However, the fate of Saurav, hangs in balance as he lost his fourth match in six outings, being defeated by Alex Davies of England 2-4 (70-42, 37-83, 57-70, 8-87, 92-31, 70-49) in group E. Thus, Sauravs chances hinge not only on his last league match with Patrick Einsle of Germany on Wednesday but also the results of other matches in his group. Alex Davies currently tops the group with five wins from six matches followed by Li Yinxi of China who has won four of his five outings. On Tuesday, Pankaj faces Nisar Ahmed Saif and Aditya meets David Meer-Bailey of New Zealand. Saurav has a day off. Title holder Ding Junhui of China, meanwhile, shrugged off his shock defeat on Sunday to trounce Michael Wilson of New Zealand 4-0 with breaks of 70, 83 and 77 for his fifth win in six matches in group A.

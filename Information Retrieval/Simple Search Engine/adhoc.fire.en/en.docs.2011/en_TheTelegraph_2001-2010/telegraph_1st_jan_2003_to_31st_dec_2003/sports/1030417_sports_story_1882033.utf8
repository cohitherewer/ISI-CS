The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Customs maintain winning run
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Satwinder Singh scores Customs second goal at the Mohun Bagan ground Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Riding two brilliant second-half goals, Calcutta Customs maintained their winning run when they beat FCI 2-0 in the BHA League first division group A match at Mohun Bagan ground Wednesday. While Customs have won all their six matches, this was the first defeat for FCI, who are now on 11 points from seven outings. Customs took the lead in the 52nd minute, thanks to A.P. Thapa. He took the ball inside the central circle and by dint of some brilliant stickwork, he almost dribbled past the entire FCI defence before hitting the target. Thapa continued to trouble the defence and combined well with fellow forward Satwinder Singh to create a number of attacking moves. Ten minutes later, one such move resulted in the second goal. Central midfielder Aqueel Ahmed dodged past a couple of rival players before releasing the ball to Thapa on the goalline. The latter then cut in further deep and squared the ball across the D for Satwinder near the far post who slotted home unchallenged. In other group A games, BSF North Bengal defeated WB Police 2-0. Biswambar Singh and J. Kandi were the scorers. In group B, Wari and CLW won big. Rabi Mukherjee, Sanjay Das (Sr-2), Subhas Ghosh, Sandip Maity (2), Sanjay Das (Jr) scored in Waris 7-1 demolition of Rangers. Xavier Nathanial got the reducer for Rangers. Erik Lakra scored a double while S. Tirki and Petras Toppo scored once in CLWs 4-0 rout of Sporting Union.  Copyright

		 Tuesday, January 21, 2003 				 Delhi HC order tomorrow
 FROM OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi: The Delhi high court Monday reserved its order on a batch of petitions challenging the ICC cricket Player Terms contract, for Wednesday. 																								A division bench of acting chief justice Devinder Gupta and Justice B. D. Ahmed reserved the order after hearing various parties in the case. 																								Cricketers Kapil Dev, Madanlal, former BCCI president N. K. P. Salve, former West Bengal chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray, umpires Ram Babu Gupta and Shyam Kumar Bansal have moved court on two main issues: (a) A settlement on signing of the Player Terms by Indian players, and (b) prohibition of release of foreign exchange to Indian sponsors of the world Cup, if Indian players were debarred from playing in the South Africa tournament. 																								A public interest litigation (PIL) has also been filed on behalf of Kapil Dev and Madanlal. 																								The petitioners in Mondays hearings contended that conditions imposed on the players were stringent and unreasonable. 																								In fact, the ICC and its marketing unit ICC Development International too wanted an amicable settlement but, they argued, it should not be loaded in favour of one side or the other. The court had already issued notices to the ICC, BCCI, RBI and eight sponsors in the case.																								The sponsoring companies said that permission or disqualification of Indian players to participate in the competition for the World Cup was one matter and denial of foreign exchange to them was another one.

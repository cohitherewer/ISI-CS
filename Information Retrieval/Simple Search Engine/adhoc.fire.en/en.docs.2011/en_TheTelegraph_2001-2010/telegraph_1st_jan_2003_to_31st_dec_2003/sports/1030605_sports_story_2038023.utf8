The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain expects a tougher fight 
- FINAL TEST l Zimbabwe to go in with unchanged XI; Johnson likely to make England debut For Zimbabwe to fight, players like Grant Flower must get going England expect James Anderson 
to fire once again Chester-le-Street: Nasser Hussain warned his young England side on Wednesday not to expect a repeat of their crushing first Test win over Zimbabwe.Hussain said on the eve of the inaugural Test match at Chester-le-Street near Durham, that his bowlers should expect a tougher battle.What happened at Lords was not Test cricket (and) I will tell my players that 19 wickets falling on one day is not the norm, he said. We mustnt panic if Zimbabwe put up a stand. What happened at Lords... was abnormal.England won the first match of the two-Test series by an innings and 92 runs inside three days as the touring side were outclassed in all departments. They have now lost their last eight Tests in a row.Hussain, who went to Durham university, said left-arm spinner Ashley Giles would play but he would not name the side until the start of the match on Thursday.With seamer Matthew Hoggard out injured, he will be in charge of an even more inexperienced attack than at Lords, with Durhams Steve Harmison the most capped fast bowler with six Tests to his name.Hussain added that several players were carrying minor injuries, with Anthony McGrath (side strain) likely to play purely as specialist batsman if selected.The swing bowlers place in the team will be taken by either James Kirtley or Richard Johnson  both of whom are yet play Test cricket.Somerset seamer Johnson, having ousted Kirtley from Englands one-day squad last week, will be the favourite to get the nod from the selectors.Much will again be expected of Lancashire quick James Anderson, who marked his Test debut by taking five for 73 as Zimbabwe were skittled out for 147 in the first innings. Anderson looks as if is shaping up well. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe will be desperate to avoid a repeat of the Lords thrashing.Captain Heath Streak, named an unchanged side, conceding that no players outside the Lords starting 11 had made a strong case for inclusion.I feel thats our best 11, he said. We have to show confidence in those players. We cant keep chopping and changing every time we lose a game.The visiting coach Geoff Marsh, the former Australian opening batsman, will be looking for a positive reaction from his players to reverse the Lords debacle. However, the signs are not encouraging. Zimbabwe have only one batsman in their party, Grant Flower, who has made a Test hundred and just one bowler, Streak, who has taken more than 50 Test wickets.And Lords provided proof, if any were needed, of how much Zimbabwe missed Andy Flower, who retired from international cricket after the World Cup.Allrounders Andy Blignaut and Sean Ervine showed glimpses of their ability at Lords while opening batsmen Dion Ebrahim and Mark Vermeulen both made fifties.Zimbabwe, the Lords thrashing notwithstanding, have named an unchanged side.England, who have not won a Test series since defeating Sri Lanka 2-0 in a three-match home series last year, will be forced to make at least one change from their successful Lords line-up following Matthew Hoggards knee injury.Deal with protestersDurham chairman Bill Midgley said the club had struck a deal with protesters opposed to President Robert Mugabes government to make sure demonstrations would be conducted outside the Riverside ground and not disrupt the game.He added that Saturday was already sold out but there were still between 2,500-3,000 seats available for Thursday and Friday.

 Foster wins 50m freestyle
 - European short-course meet
 Foster likes to win the hard way Dublin: Briton Mark Foster regained the 50m freestyle crown after almost missing the semi-finals on the opening day of the European short-course championships on Thursday. Former world short-course champion Foster, who has made a habit of cutting it fine in heats, just sneaked into the semi-finals in a swim-off for the last qualifying place. I like to do it the hard way since I had to do extra-time this morning in the swim-off, said Foster, who had six swims on the day  four in the 50m freestyle and two in the 4x50m medley relay in which Germany set a world best time in the final and Britain finished seventh. Italys Massimiliano Rosolino shared the first title of the four-day championships with 19-year-old Russian Yuri Prilukov in a dead-heat in the 400m freestyle but was denied a second gold in the 200m individual medley by Finnish Jani Sievinen. Sievinen, the short-course world champion, retained his 200 medley title in a championship record one minute 55.40 seconds, although he had come to Dublin hoping to break his own almost 10-year-old world record of 1:54.65. Today was not the right day. I didnt feel too good, said Sievinen. Olympic champion Rosolino had to settle for silver in 1:56.70 barely an hour after he and the fast-finishing Prilukov shared 400 freestyle gold in 3:40.19 ahead of Czech pace-setter Kvetoslav Svoboda. Yuri was very fast in the last metres. I saw him coming nearer and nearer, put my head down and gave it everything, said Rosolino, who left his training base in Australia just 10 days ago. Slovenia experienced the rare sensation of sharing top spot on the medals table with Germany after Blaz Medvesek led from start to finish to win the mens 200m backstroke in a championship record 1:52.60 and Alenka Kejzar scored a runaway win in the womens 200 individual medley in 2:09.32.  Germanys wins came from Sarah  Poewe and the mens 4x50 medley relay squad of Thomas Rupprath,  Mark Warnecke, Fabian Friedrich and Carsten Dehmlow who  set a world best of 1:34.46.

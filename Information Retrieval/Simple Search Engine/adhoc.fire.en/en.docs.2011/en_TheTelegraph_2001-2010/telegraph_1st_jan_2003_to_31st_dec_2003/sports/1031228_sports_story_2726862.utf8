 Gibbs belts 142
 Herschelle Gibbs en route to his 11th century in Durban on Saturday. (AFP) Durban, Dec. 27 (Reuters): South Africa built a first innings lead on the back of a blazing 142 from Herschelle Gibbs on the second day of the second Test against the West Indies on Saturday. South Africa reached 303 for three, a lead of 39, when bad light ended play 16 overs early. Gibbs was at the crease for more than four hours and faced 175 balls and hit 23 fours. Things went really smoothly and it was probably one of my better hundreds. I know the wicket here. Once you get in you should be able to get at least 50 and a hundred, said Gibbs. Earlier, Makhaya Ntini ended with five for 66, his sixth five-wicket haul in Tests, as the visitors were dismissed for 264. West Indies were indebted to a career-best 67 from Vasbert Drakes, who hit nine fours and a six. When South Africa batted, Gibbs played with audacious freedom on a steadily flattening pitch, driving off either foot with sublime timing. It was his 11th Test century but his first against West Indies. Sri Lanka is the only team he has yet to score a hundred against. South Africa lost their first wicket when Graeme Smiths square drive off Fidel Edwards flew to Ramnaresh Sarwan at deep backward point. It was 99 for two when Jacques Rudolph attempted to leave a ball from Adam Sanford but sent a looping catch to gully. The runs flowed at an average of more than five an over while Gibbs and Kallis flayed the West Indian attack. They earned most of the credit for the 139 South Africa scored in the 27 overs between lunch and tea. The third-wicket pair shared 168 runs before they were separated an hour into the final session when Gibbs attempted to pull a delivery from Sanford and was bowled off the bottom edge.  Copyright

 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Subrata Bhattacharyas tactics had helped Tollygunge Agragami seal Mohun Bagans fate in the one-day curtain raiser to the local season earlier this month. The two sides will lock horns again, in the Super Division, on Tuesday. Tollygunge have split points in two of the games while the other was abandoned. Mohun Bagan have made an impressive start with a 6-0 victory over WB Police. Coach Aloke Mukherjee however feels it will be a new and different game Tuesday.

 Warne latest in rogues gallery
 London: Shane Warne is the third famous sports personality to make a sudden and ignominious exit from a global tournament for failing a dope test. Ben Johnson was banished from the 1988 Seoul Olympics after testing positive for steroids following his victory in world record time in the 100m. Diego Maradona, the finest footballer of his era, was ejected from the 1994 soccer World Cup for taking a variety of stimulants. Australian leg-spinner Warne was due to fly home from the World Cup after testing positive for diuretics. Diuretics, which help eliminate fluids from the body, can be misused to lose weight rapidly or to mask other drugs by reducing the concentration of urine. Drug use in track and field, the showpiece of the summer Olympics, reached a peak in the 1980s. Documents released after the unification of Germany revealed that East German sports authorities pursued a state programme of systematic doping, with spectacular results in athletics and swimming. The Soviet Union also used drugs in sport widely as part of the ideological Cold War designed to demonstrate the supremacy of the Communist system through success in sport.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

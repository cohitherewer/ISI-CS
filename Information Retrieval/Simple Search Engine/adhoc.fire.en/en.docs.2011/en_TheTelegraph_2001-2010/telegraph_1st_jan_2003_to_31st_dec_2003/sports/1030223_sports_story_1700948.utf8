 Freeman splits with husband
Melbourne: The personal life of Olympic 400 m champion Cathy Freeman took another twist Saturday when the Australian announced her split with husband Alexander Bodecker. Freeman, 30, had helped nurse the American sportswear executive last year in Melbourne in his successful battle against throat cancer. I have decided to split, effective immediately, from Alexander Bodecker, Freeman said. As a couple, we have had our shares of highs and lows and through that both our lives have changed. It was always going to be difficult with one of us living in the United States and the other in Melbourne.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003  Daniel the one to watch 
 BY STAR RACER		 Daniel Calcutta: Nearly half of the total  horse strength in Wednesdays six event race card hails  from owner MAM Ramaswamys camp, managed by trainers Daniel  David and Errol Bhungard. Therefore, it may not come as  a surprise if the afternoon starts with a firework and continues  till the end.  However, in the main event, the 1,400m Madras Race Club Cup  for horses in the highest class  Inside Story may foil their designs. The Vijay Singh-trained four-year-old, a convincing winner over a 1,200m trip, is known to relish the slated distance. The Dark Nile-Success Story son will be partnered by apprentice Surjeet Singh.				 										Daniels Far Hope in the 1,200m Air Force Cup, gets the first call. The Tecorno-Save The Future son was not given a punishing run in his last outing, which was won by stable-mate Dashing Chief. Amyn Merchant partners the three-year-old.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Injury cloud over Sehwag
 Sehwag may be released by Leicestershire due to a back injury London: Indias opening batsman Virender Sehwag may be released by Leicestershire for the remainder of the season following a genuine back injury, a leading daily reported on Sunday, according to PTI. A genuine back injury is expected to be used as the reason for releasing Sehwag for the remainder of the season and Australian fast bowler, Matt Nicholson, is believed to head their wanted list, the Sunday Telegraph said. Sehwag has not been a success at Grace Road, though his batting has attracted the Asian community to Leicestershires matches for the first time. Family in the dark Whatever be the nature of Sehwags back injury, his family (at least) is in the dark, adds Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta. Mujhe kuch maloom nahin  sirf yeh maloom hain ki woh match khel rahe hain, informed Sehwags mother, when contacted by The Telegraph in New Delhi late Sunday. Subsequent calls to the Sehwag household, though, went unanswered.  Copyright

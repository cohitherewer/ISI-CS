Paes, who has been sidelined since August due to a lesion in his brain and still awaits clearance from his doctors to enter competitive play, said he was looking forward to his return to the tour. The last three months have been extremely difficult for me and I feel I have been granted a new lease, not only in tennis, but in life, said Paes. It is an absolute honour to qualify for the Masters Cup, and Im even more delighted to have achieved it in my first year with David Rikl. My destiny is in the hands of my doctors, and Ill have my final MRI later this month to determine if I am able to play in Houston, Paes said. Paes had actually expected to qualify for the tournament and Fridays announcement officially confirmed it. Paes and Rikl, ranked No. 7 on the ATP doubles race, teamed together for the first time this season and they put together a 29-13 match record, winning titles in Dubai and Gstaad while reaching the final at TMS Miami.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Security beef-up planned
Dhaka: Security will be beefed up during the triangular one-day series involving India, South Africa and Bangladesh starting later this week, officials said on Monday. Bangladesh face India in the tournaments opening match on Friday. The authorities have accepted our appeal to deploy adequate security forces during the series, a Bangladesh Cricket Board official, said. Security is a priority following protests against the US-led invasion of Iraq in the country over the last two weeks. At least 500 police and other security personnel will be deployed in the Dhaka stadium match venue and players hotels. The India and South Africa teams are scheduled to arrive in Dhaka on Wednesday.

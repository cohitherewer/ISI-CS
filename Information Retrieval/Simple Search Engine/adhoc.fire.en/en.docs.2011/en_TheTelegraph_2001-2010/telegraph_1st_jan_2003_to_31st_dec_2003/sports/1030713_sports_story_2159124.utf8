 Remember the hurt, Smith tells his boys
 Shaun Pollock reflects the Proteas mood on Saturday London, July 12 (Reuters): South Africa captain Graeme Smith told his players to remember the hurt after they were crushed by England in the tri-series final at Lords on Saturday. Smith pulled his players together into a huddle immediately after their seven-wicket defeat. I told them: Lets remember the hurt and take this into the future, he said at a news conference. I just wanted the guys to remember how it feels, not to forget it and to learn from it. I cant tell you what happened. There was a bit of juice in the wicket early on but England put the ball in the right areas, all credit to them, and every ball we played we seemed to nick. We were comprehensively beaten. But Smith, whose side was dismissed for 107, said he did not think the result would have an effect on the Test series. The Test series is a totally different series, he said. We have a few fresh faces coming in and we have a wonderful opportunity to turn things around. Smith had said he hoped to inflict some mental scars on England during the one-dayers but denied his players had been badly hurt. I dont think there are any mental scars. The players are pretty disappointed in the dressing room but we have given 100 per cent on tour so far. England captain Michael Vaughan said: I thought Gough set the tone for the day. He didnt give them any kind of width. Jimmy Anderson is an unbelievable talent as a wicket-taker but Gough at the other end held things back for us.  Copyright

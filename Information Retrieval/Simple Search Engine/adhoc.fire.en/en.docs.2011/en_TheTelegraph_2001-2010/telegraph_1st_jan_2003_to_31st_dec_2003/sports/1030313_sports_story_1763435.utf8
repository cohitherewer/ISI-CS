The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhupathi runs into Paes
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi and Tim Henman won their first-round match at the Indian Wells Masters Series meet Tuesday to set up a clash with Leander Paes and David Rikl. According to information received here, the unseeded pair of Bhupathi and Henman saw off South Africans David Adams and Robbie Koenig 7-5, 6-3. Paes and Rikl, the eighth seeds, got a first-round bye. Bhupathi, who has had a rough time with Joshua Eagle, is seeking his first title this year with new partner Henman. Paes, on the other hand, has turned the tide after a dismal 2002 and is eyeing a hattrick of crowns. He won the Dubai Open with Rikl before topping with Nenad Zimonjic last week in Delray Beach.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fifa moves Bagan case
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: A difficult and unsuccessful season has just ended, but controversy may not leave the Mohun Bagan camp too soon. This time, its about a practice which is not very new. But, authorities looking into this issue have to be taken seriously. The Fifa has confirmed that a case is on to investigate Mohun Bagans Nigerian recruit Isa Musa Erojas claim that he was not paid according to his contract. The world body had written to the club a few weeks back, seeking a clarification, and the fact that an inquiry has been started means the matter is not closed. We can confirm that a case has been opened regarding the player Isa Musa Eroje and the club Mohun Bagan in regards to outstanding salaries, says a communiqu received by The Telegraph from the Fifa media department. No comments can be made at this time as to what the Fifa Players Status Committee plans to do as it would not be appropriate for us to pre-empt any decision the Committee might make. Each case is unique and requires that all of the relevant issues be addressed, said the message. The club secretary, as usual, said things are fine and accused the player of being unruly. He was irregular at practice. We suspended him, said Anjan Mitra Friday. He said he is not apprehending any trouble about this. Pay disputes and players not being paid the amount initially stated is nothing new in Maidan football culture. Only, in Mohun Bagans case, it has been a rule rather than exception this season. Some senior players, including internationals, have said in the condition of anonymity that they were forced to renew their contracts only to recover significant chunks of the amount promised to them last season.

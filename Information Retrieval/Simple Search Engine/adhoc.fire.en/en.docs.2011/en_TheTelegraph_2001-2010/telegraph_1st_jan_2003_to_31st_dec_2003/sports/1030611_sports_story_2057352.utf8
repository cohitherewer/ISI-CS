 India says it will pay up
New Delhi: A day after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) threatened to impose sanctions on several Asian countries including India for failing to pay their share of its operating budget for 2003, the sports ministry Tuesday said it would be making the contributions in the current fiscal. A ministry release said India has paid its dues for the year 2002 to WADA, and now that Parliament has cleared the budget for this, the money will be available to be paid. As a matter of fact, the government of India has introduced a new scheme for dope test and under the scheme, payment of contribution to WADA has been provided for, it added. On signing the Copenhagan Declaration the release said: As a member of the foundation board of WADA, India is totally committed to elimination of menace of drugs in sport. (PTI)  Copyright

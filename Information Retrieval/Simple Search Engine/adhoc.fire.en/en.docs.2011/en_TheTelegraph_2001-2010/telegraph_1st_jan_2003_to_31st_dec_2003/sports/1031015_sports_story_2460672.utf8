		 Wednesday, October 15, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Bangalore: One of the countrys oldest sports clubs run by Indian Telephone Industries (ITI), best known for its football team, is about to close down due to dearth of funds, a key official confirmed on Tuesday. We are moving in that direction as we have simply run out of funds, club president P.B.O. Warjri said. We will have to close down.				 																																	The reason for the club shutting down can be attributed to the huge losses incurred by the Bangalore-based telecom equipment major in recent years. ITI was a powerful football team in the earlier decades and they won the national club title in 1977 winning the inaugural Federation Cup before fading away. Warjri also indicated that ITI football club is up for grabs. The club was also active in other sports, including hockey, volleyball, basketball and ball badminton, but those teams never rose to the heights of the football team, which gave ITI a national name.				 																																	Lahore: Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria will play for Essex next season in the English county championship. Kaneria said on Tuesday that Essex had sent him a contract for a year. It will be a good learning experience for me and hopefully after playing against different opposition it will make me a better bowler, Kaneria said. The 22-year-old spinner has taken 51 wickets in 12 Tests and played in seven one day Internationals for Pakistan.				 																																	New Delhi: National champion Pankaj Advani continued his superb run while the women cueists put up a disappointing display on the fourth day of the world snooker championship in Jiangmen, China on Tuesday. Advani beat Jin Long of China 72-28, 9-78, 71-35, 104-24, 69-43 while Merchant came from behind to defeat Hong Kongs Chi Wai Au in 35-51, 78-32, 30-76, 70-25, 86-33, 21-99, 92-6.				 																																	Chennai: Maharashtra boys asserted their supremacy by clinching both the boys under-19 and under-15 titles in the inaugural junior and sub-junior inter-state squash championship here.				 																																	In the boys under-19 final, Maharashtra prevailed over Tamil Nadu with a 2-1 verdict. In the under-15 all Maharashtra final, Maharashtra A beat Maharashtra B 3-0. Earlier, Saurav Ghosal of Tamil Nadu had no difficulty in beating Vikas Jangra 9-3, 9-1, 9-3 in 41 minutes. 				 																																	Rome: Juventus striker Alessandro Del Piero is confident of returning to action on his birthday early next month. 				 																																	The Italy international has been sidelined since September 21 when he suffered a calf strain in a 2-2 home draw against Roma. 				 																																	My recovery is going well and I am very satisfied, Del Piero told the Gazzetta dello Sport. 				 																																	Sydney: The coach in charge of Australias powerful Olympic swimming programme was barred from contact with athletes on Tuesday after a former pupil accused him of sexual abuse and stalking. Former junior swimmer Emma Fuller claimed Australian  swimming high performance director Greg Hodge had a sick  obsession with her and she applied to a Sydney Court this  week for an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) to prevent  the coach approaching her.

 Pakistan subdue Germany 5-2 
Amstelveen: Pakistan saw off a second-half fightback by Germany to post a 5-2 win in the 25th Champions Trophy meet on Thursday. It was Pakistans second victory in four matches as they maintained their unbeaten run in this six-nation event, having drawn two. Germany, who gave an improved display, suffered their fourth straight defeat. Goals by Kashif Jawad (9th, 25th), Rehan Butt (16th), Sohail Abbas (65th) and Salim Khalid (67th), set up the Pakistani success, while for Germany, Benedikt Sperling (43rd) and Benjamin Kopp (46th) found the target. The inexperienced Germans were bamboozled by the dazzling individual play of the Pakistanis who generated appreciable pace early on and used the wings to stretch the defence. The Germans, forced on the defensive for much of the first-half, struck twice in quick succession, after the restart. Sperling scored off a Kopp pass and then Kopp let fly from top of the circle following a counter-attack that caught the rival defence napping. (PTI)  Copyright

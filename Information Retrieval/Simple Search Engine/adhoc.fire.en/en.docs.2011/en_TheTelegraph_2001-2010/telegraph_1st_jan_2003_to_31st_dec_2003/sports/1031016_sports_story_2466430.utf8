 Kaiser slams golden goal rule 
Munich: Franz Beckenbauer has labelled the golden goal as ridiculous, claiming it deprives the spectators of further goals and excitement in extra-time. Beckenbauer, who also heads the 2006 German World Cup committee, watched as the German womens team lifted the World Cup on Sunday with a golden goal victory over Sweden. It is absolute nonsense, Beckenbauer told the FM Radio network. It is the most ridiculous rule ever brought into football. Most of the important events happen towards the end of the match such as in extra-time. Beckenbauer pointed out Germanys 1970 World Cup semi-final with Italy when five goals were scored in the extra-time period as Italy triumphed 4-3. This match was voted game of the century yet would not have even been talked about if the golden goal had been in place at the time, declared Beckenbauer. Whoever invented this golden goal is an enemy of football. The rule has often come under fire for making teams too defensive in extra time for fear of conceding and putting too much pressure on the referee. European footballs governing body Uefa have introduced a silver goal for the Uefa Cup and Champions League finals this season whereby the team leading after the first 15 minutes of extra-time wins.

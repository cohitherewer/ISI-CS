The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. notch up narrow victory
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  John Ugwu, who got the matchwinner. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting are riding the high they gained with the defeat of the mighty East Bengal the other day. Surely they did concede a few counter-attacks, but their 1-0 victory over Mohammedan AC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday was more emphatic than the scoreline suggests. John Ugwu scored from a free-kick in the 22nd minute. That keeps Mohammedan Sporting still in the third spot (26 points from 15 matches, yet to play Mohun Bagan), Mohammedan AC are now in sixth spot (18 points from 14 matches). It was a clear-cut match, slow-paced and almost always the Mohammedan AC-way. In the 22nd minute, the free-kick was awarded near the top of the box and Johns shot cleared the wall and as Mohammedan AC goalkeeper Shankar Dey dived to his left, the ball eluded his reach, taking the far post before moving in. Seikh Sanjib shot wide from close a little later or it would have been a proper perspective victory for the winners.  Copyright

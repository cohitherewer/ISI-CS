 Dyson hopes to knock off Aussies 
Colombo: Sri Lankas new cricket coach John Dyson said Monday he hoped he could lift the team to knock the Australians off their perch as the best side in international cricket. Dyson, a former Australian Test batsman, said he would be happy to see Sri Lanka beat Australia and believed it was possible given the depth and skill of local players. I would be very happy for Sri Lanka to beat Australia, Dyson told reporters when he arrived here on a brief visit before formally taking up his new job from September. Australia are due to play a Test series in Sri Lanka next March. Dyson, 49, declined to give financial details of his 18-month contract with the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka, but said he was pleased and excited with his new job. Dyson, who coached New South Wales after retiring from Test cricket, replaces fellow Australian Dav Whatmore who masterminded Sri Lankas World Cup triumph in 1996. Dyson said he wanted to improve on Whatmores record with the Sri Lankan team. I want to develop an individual training schedule for players, he said. It is important that players get individual attention.  (AFP)  Copyright

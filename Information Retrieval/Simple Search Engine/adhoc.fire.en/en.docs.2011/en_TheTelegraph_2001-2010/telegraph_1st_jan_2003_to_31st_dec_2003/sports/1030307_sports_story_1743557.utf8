The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vaughan keen on ODI captaincy
 Vaughan: No rivalry with Trescothick London: Michael Vaughan has asked to be made the next England one-day captain. The Yorkshire opener is favourite to succeed Nasser Hussain, who quit the post when England failed to reach the Super Six of the World Cup in South Africa. But Vaughan said he would work happily under Marcus Trescothick if his friend and England teammate was handed the captains job. The truth is that I would like a crack at the job if it came along and so would Marcus, Vaughan told the Daily Mail Thursday. But equally there is no chance of any rivalry developing between us. We have been good friends for a long time and have always got on very well together. That will continue, and, while neither of us is greatly experienced at the job, I would be delighted for him if he got the chance and I am sure he would be very pleased for me. It is out of our hands in any case, and obviously other names will be discussed as well. Vaughan has been Englands leading performer this winter and was Man of the Series as Australia retained the Ashes in emphatic fashion. Some are concerned his form may suffer if handed the one-day captaincy, although Hussain intends to retain control of the Test side. The fact is that, whoever is chosen, we will not know how they will react until they settle into the job, said Vaughan. It could make you a better player or it could prove to be a distraction.

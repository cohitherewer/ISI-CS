 Im in the final stages of my career: Monica Seles
Paris: Facing up to her earliest ever Grand Slam exit on Tuesday three-time French Open champion Monica Seles conceded that she was fighting a losing battle to stay on the court. The 29-year-old, who fought her way back following an absence of over two years after being stabbed in the back by a Steffi Graf fan in Germany ten years ago, slumped 4-6, 0-6 in just under an hour to hard-hitting Russian Nadia Petrova. It was the second time in two weeks that the American veteran went down to 76th-ranked Petrova after retiring in Rome two weeks ago with a left foot injury which she admits has become unbearable. After one battle to return to the court, surgery is something Seles is loath to consider at this stage in her career. Realistically, I know Im in the latter stages of my career. I dont have the luxury of taking five or six months off, she said. At the same time I dont want to have the surgery to put a screw in my foot, I am trying everything. I mean you think five months off, surgery, thats another three months of training. Lindsay (Davenport) has done it. Shes two years younger than I am. It could be done but I just dont think I would have that uphill challenge in me to do it. This year, really, since January has been very difficult. Its been a struggle. I think I do have to give it a break and then reassess what I want to do after how my foot responds to it. Its one of these things, its your bone and theres not much you can do  just got to give it time. Seles, one of only two women ever to win a hattrick of titles here between 1990-1992 before being attacked, has never done worse than a quarter final finish in her ten previous appearances at Roland Garros. The American 12th seed had led 4-3 in the opening set but the 20-year-old Russian upped the tempo to win every game that followed. Yugoslav-born Seles has collected 53 WTA titles and nine Grand Slams in her 14-year career, but only one major crown since returning from her stabbing ordeal eight years ago  the 1996 Australian Open. But she ruled out making a rash decision on her future. Im a positive person. Ill try not to give up. I mean, Ive faced worse stuff. This is not the way I would like to leave. I do think if Im healthy I can play good tennis and I wont give up. Im hard-headed but I understand that I just have to give it time. I wasnt coming here with too many expectations  obviously my wish to play is not matching my performance and I just have to accept that, said Seles. The American, who has failed to win this season despite having reached the finals in Tokyo and Dubai, explained that she would now take ten days rest and decide whether she would compete in Wimbledon next month. Id definitely like to play, but if Im at the level Im at today you definitely wont see me, she said.  (AFP)  Copyright

				 																																	Prague: Three-time Olympic javelin champion Jan Zelezny will not participate in Golden League events this season, fearing injury could stop him from defending his gold medal in Athens next year.

The beginning of the season is nearing and I still am not sure how many events I will compete in, he said.

The Rome side was 2-0 up at that stage and eventually won 3-0.				 																																	Mihajlovic said he approached the referee to inform him of a handball. I told the referee that there was a handball. Corradi was angry with me, said Mihajlovic. But Corradi was not upset. It was a very sporting gesture, one we should see more often on the field.

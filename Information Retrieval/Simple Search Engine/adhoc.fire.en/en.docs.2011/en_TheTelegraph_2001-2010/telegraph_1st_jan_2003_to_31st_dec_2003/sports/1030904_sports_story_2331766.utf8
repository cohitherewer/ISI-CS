 No ban, but Kelli set to lose medals
 Kelli White  Paris: American sprint star Kelli White has  escaped a two-year ban for doping, the International Association  of Athletics Federation (IAAF) general secretary Istvan  Gyulai said on Wednesday. But she will almost certainly  be stripped of both her World Championship gold medals after  testing positive for a stimulant. White, who won the 100m and 200m in the Paris championships, protested her innocence after the IAAF announced it was investigating the content of the drug, Modafinil, also known by its brand name Provigil. Modafinil is not on the banned list but is related to drugs that are prohibited, and is likely to be forbidden at next years Olympic Games. Torri Edwards of the United States will take Whites 100m gold and Russias Anastasiya Kapachinskaya the 200m gold.  Lagat tests positive Nairobi: Leading Kenyan  1,500 m runner Bernard Lagat has tested positive for the  banned blood-boosting substance erythropoietin (EPO) and  is provisionally suspended from competition. He tested positive to EPO on August 8 after running a race somewhere in Germany, David Okeyo, secretary-general of Athletics Kenya, told Reuters on Wednesday. We received the report August 22 in Paris (at the world championships), but we decided to keep it a secret in order not to affect our team. As of now, he is provisionally suspended pending the result of the B test. Lagats agent James Templeton said in a statement that the Kenyan athlete denied taking any banned substance.  Prakash  Prakash will be fit for Dutch  tie New York: The knee injury  that forced Prakash Amritraj out of the ITF Futures tournament  in Jakarta this week will not keep him out of Indias Davis  Cup World Group play-off tie against Holland (September  19-21), his father Vijay Amritraj said on Wednesday. He has injured his knee tendon. It is not serious and he will be fit to play in the Davis Cup, Vijay said in New York. Prakash retired hurt in the first round of the $15,000 event in Jakarta on Tuesday while trailing Sadik Kadir of Australia 5-7, 1-2.  Bhutias Perak in fine form Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutias  Perak FC took a big step towards topping their group in  the Malaysian Cup on Wednesday, beating Public Bank 3-0,  says A Staff Reporter. The Indian star played the full match but didnt score. Speaking to The Telegraph from Ipoh, Bhutia said: Perak had drawn 1-1 with this team in the away match earlier. Todays win should help us top. Though I didnt score, I set up two. Perak have won all four matches after signing in Bhutia on loan. Their next match is on Saturday, against Johor FC.  Bhutia informed that Perak have released the $10,000  due to East Bengal for the deal. East Bengal officials said  they are yet to receive it.  (Agencies) Copyright

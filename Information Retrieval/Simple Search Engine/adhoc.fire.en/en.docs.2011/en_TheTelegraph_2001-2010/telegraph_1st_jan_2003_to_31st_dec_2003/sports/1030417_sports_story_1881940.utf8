 Lawson out of 2nd Test
Port-of-Spain: West Indies fast bowler Jermaine Lawson will miss the second Test against Australia after going down with chickenpox. Veteran wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs is also not available because of a groin muscle injury, a team spokesman said Tuesday. The 22-year-old Lawson, who took two for 111 and one for 31 in the first Test, would return to his native Jamaica and he hopes to recover for the third Test in Barbados. Lawson, regarded as one of the West Indies most promising fast bowlers, completed his first tour last year in India and Bangladesh. Tino Best will fly out from Barbados on Wednesday to take Lawsons place in the squad. Jacobs was ruled out after doctor Terry Ali confirmed that they 34-year-old had torn a muscle in the groin region. Jacobs suffered the injury during the first innings against Australia but batted on bravely to make 54 not out, sharing in a sixth-wicket partnership of 131 with Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Jacobs also came out to bat in the second innings despite being in obvious pain. He used a runner in both innings, though he didnt come out to keep wickets at all in the Test, which the visitors won by nine wickets. There was better news for the West Indies, however, after Chanderpaul and vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan were both passed fit to play. Chanderpaul suffered a painful knock on the knee after making 100 in the first innings of the first Test. He needed a runner for the second and did not field.Sarwan missed the first Test because of a fractured finger. West Indies, crushed by nine wickets in four days in the first Test, initially named a 15-man squad for the second match with Jamaican opener Chris Gayle again being left out. Gayle was controversially omitted from the first Test match after the WICB initially declared him ineligible. The squad includes 20-year-old off-spinner Omari Banks, the first player from the island of Anguilla to be called up to the senior West Indies side. Though Lawson was far from intimidating in the first Test in Gerogetown, his absence will handicap the West Indian bowling attack. A quick bowler with deceptive movement off the wicket, Lawson could have been the man to trouble the awesome Aussies. Perhaps bigger is the absence of Jacobs, whose runs under pressure have saved his team on many occasions.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

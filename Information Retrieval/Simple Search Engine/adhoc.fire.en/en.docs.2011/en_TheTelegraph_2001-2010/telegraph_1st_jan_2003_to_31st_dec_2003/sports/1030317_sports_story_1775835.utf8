The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nets-free Indians head for beach
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Durban: The Indian cricketers had another nets-free day, Sunday, but headed for the beach to stretch, run and swim. Idea, of course, being that they remain prim for Thursdays semi- final against Kenya. Look, at times, the players do need to busy themselves with other things... However, beginning Monday, there will be nets on three successive days, coach John Wright told The Telegraph. Meanwhile, the larger Team India is expanding. While Ajit Agarkars wife, Fatima, was the first to join (during the Super Six stage), Sanjay Bangars family has come along. Very much around, too, is Yuvraj Singhs mother (Shabnam).  Copyright

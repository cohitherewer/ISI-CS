 Bengal force TN to follow on 
 - Paul takes seven for 44  Paul continues to take bagful of wickets Tirunelveli: Shib Shankar Paul produced a deadly pace bowling to claim seven for 44 as Bengal forced Tamil Nadu to follow on on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy Elite Group B league match on Tuesday. Paul single-handedly sent Tamil Nadu packing for just 188 in 84.1 overs, 45 minutes after lunch. That meant Bengal gained an all-important 212-run first-innings lead and captain Devang Gandhi made no hesitancy in asking the hosts to bat again. In their second innings, Tamil Nadu, last years runners-up, were tottering at 110 for two at close and they still need 102 more runs to avoid the humiliation of an innings defeat. In reply to Bengals first-innings score of 400, Tamil Nadu, resuming at overnight 84 for 3, found Pauls bowling too hot to handle. Paul, who took two for 23 on Monday, claimed five more on Tuesday to take his tally to seven. S. Badrinath, overnight 49, waged a lone battle scoring 86 (192b, 274m, 2x6, 9x4) while medium pacer C. Ganapathy (32) offered some resistance coming in at No. 8 as seven Tamil Nadu batsmen failed to cross the single digit score. Badrinath too eventually fell a prey to Paul, who has had a fine run this season. The 22-year old bowler had claimed six wickets apiece in an innings in Bengals previous matches against Rajasthan and Karnataka. Tamil Nadu were cautious in their second innings. But, Paul provided the breakthrough, trapping Suresh (10) leg before while spinner Utpal Chatterjee castled Kartik (35). (PTI)  Copyright

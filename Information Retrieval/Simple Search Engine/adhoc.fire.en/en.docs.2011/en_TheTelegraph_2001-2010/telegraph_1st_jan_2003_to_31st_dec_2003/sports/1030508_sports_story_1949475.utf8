The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mohammedan Sporting hit hard
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings elevation to the National Football League isnt looking as rosy as it was even a few days back. Their coach Mohammed Habeeb was approached by Mohun Bagan a couple of days back, but while the Bade Mian turned them down, some of the clubs players couldnt. At the local transfers Wednesday the club lost three key players to Bagan. Mohammedan Sportings No. 1 goaltender Prashanta Dora and second man Imran Khan left, as did Insan Ali. The club did get some back in acquiring Manas Das from Tollygunge Agragami, and in retaining Arjan Ali, but club head honchos are still on tenterhooks as to what direction their stars Dipendu Biswas and Syed Rahim Nabi would take, both being approached by the Big Two of the Maidan. Club secretary Sultan Ahmed pooh-poohed it, saying, We dont consider this a big loss, and well be back with big buys, but the itch persists. Bagan were the nett purchasers Wednesday. Apart from the above, they also picked up Babun Kar and Shyam babu Rout (from Bhratri Sangha) and Debkumar Shasmal from Tollygunge Agragami. East Bengal retained the services of Subhasis Roy Chowdhury, Sangram Mukherjee and Chandan Das. The red-and-gold brigade also bought Prosenjit Debnath and Goutam Debnath from Wari. There were 50 signings Wednesday, including withdrawals. Bagan eves win big Mohun Bagans womens soccer team Tuesday scripted a 10-0 thumping of Nabajanma Sangha at the Howrah Municipal Stadium in their IFA womens league Wednesday. Shanta Dhara scored three and N. Alam hit four, with M. Das, R. Ghosh and S. Saha pitching in with goals too.  In another match at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium, Bally Gramanchal drew 1-1 with Rampur MS.

 Organisers preparing sporting wicket
Mohali: A sporting wicket that would equally assist the bowlers and batsmen is being prepared for the second Test between India and New Zealand beginning here on October 16. A sporting wicket has been prepared for the match. For the first two days, it should help seamers, on the third and part of the fourth day it should be a batsmans dream and for the rest of the match spinners should enjoy bowling on the wicket, Punjab Cricket Association president I.S. Bindra said on Wednesday. He said more additions would be made in the infrastructure available in the stadium and the spectators would now be able to catch the action in slow motion. A video replay screen will become operational by October 10 and a world class gymnasium will be commissioned before the match. We have also imported aeration machines so that outfield is not very hard and the player gets a cushioning effect while fielding, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

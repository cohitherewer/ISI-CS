 Harbhajan fit, to join Lancs next month
Chandigarh, May 24 (PTI): Harbhajan Singh on Saturday said he would join Lancashire next month as his finger injury had almost healed. The special exercises recommended by a South African specialist have helped much in the healing process and my finger looks fine now, the 22-year-old said from Jalandhar. Though he was supposed to join the County April-end, an injury to his index finger delayed his departure. The off-spinner said he would leave for Lancashire next month and play till the end of the season in September. Harbhajan said he was looking forward to a successful stint and enjoy bowling on the bouncy tracks of England. Harbhajan had consulted Indian team physio Andrew Leipus and a South African specialist during his visit to Johannesburg recently. He has benefitted immensely from the exercises recommended by the specialist.  Copyright

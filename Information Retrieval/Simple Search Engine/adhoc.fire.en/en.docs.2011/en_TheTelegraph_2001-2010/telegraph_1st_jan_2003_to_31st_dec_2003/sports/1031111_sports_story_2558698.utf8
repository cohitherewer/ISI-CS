The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Slight delay in NFL kick-off
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The next National Football League gets off late this month, but with just a couple of days adjustment, according to AIFF secretary Albert Colaco. The generally rumoured start schedule of November 22, however, will not be possible. The delay, though will be minimal, Colaco said. He also said that the Super Cup  between National Football League winners East Bengal and Federation Cup winners Mahindra United  will surely be held, despite the ground originally scheduled for it on November 16  the Ambedkar Stadium  not being available due to political bookings. It will certainly be held and had not been cancelled by any means, Colaco said. We will reschedule it any day after the 16th. The announcement on this and on the NFL dates will be made in a couple of days by AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. Colaco refused to comment on the sponsorship issue of the NFL either, and whether the Reliance group has made any commitment. It is learnt that the final touches are in progress and the announcement will be made before the teams managers get together in New Delhi on November 16. The first match was tentatively scheduled to be played between Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting.  Copyright

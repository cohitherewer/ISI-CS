Commenting on Indias 2006 World Cup draw, Constantine said, it is a tough group, but I do not want my players to be afraid of Japan. He said he would request the AIFF to have a break in the National Football League (NFL) after the conclusion of the 11th round on January 22. Constantine wants a minimum three-week training camp and a foreign tour as part of his World Cup qualifying round preparations. Constantine also stressed he would insist the AIFF agree on playing their group 3 matches on a home and away basis. He had heard offers were being made to play the qualifiers in Japan and Oman but he would resist it. If the home-away format was agreed to, Indias matches could be played in Calcutta or Bangalore and would commence in February 2004 and stretch till November 2004.  Copyright

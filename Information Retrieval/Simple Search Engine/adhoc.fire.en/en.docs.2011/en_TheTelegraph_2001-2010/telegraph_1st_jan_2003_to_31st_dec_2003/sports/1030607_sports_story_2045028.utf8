The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Salanson was drug-free
 Fabrice Salanson Berlin: Further tests have confirmed there were no drugs in the body of French rider Fabrice Salanson, who died before the start of the Tour of Germany, German state prosecutors said Friday. The 23-year-old Brioches La Boulangere rider was found dead in his hotel room in Dresden Tuesday morning, shortly before the start of the seven-day events first stage. The post-mortem revealed no trace of injury or drugs but more tests were conducted at an International Olympic Committee (IOC) accredited laboratory in Kreischa, Germany. Those tests showed no signs of drugs, said Dresden chief state prosecutor Juergen Schaer. Prosecutors said Salanson had died of heart failure. The urine and blood tests performed at the lab were notably aimed at establishing whether the blood-boosting drug erythropoietin (EPO) could be connected to the death. Cycling is particularly prone to drug-taking with many positive tests for EPO, which scientists say can lead to heart attacks by thickening the blood. Prosecutors were waiting for the official report from the Kreischa lab before closing the case, Schaer added. Salansons body will now be flown to France, where a funeral ceremony was due to take place on Saturday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

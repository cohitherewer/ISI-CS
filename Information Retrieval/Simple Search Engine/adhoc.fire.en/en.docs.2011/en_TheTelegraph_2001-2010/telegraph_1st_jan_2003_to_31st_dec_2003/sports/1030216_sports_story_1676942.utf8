 NZ confirm Nairobi boycott
Johannesburg: New Zealand will not travel to Nairobi for their match against Kenya and have asked the sports governing body to switch the fixture to South Africa. The situation is that the New Zealand board has reconfirmed its decision made on January 31, which is not to allow the New Zealand team to travel to Nairobi for the match on February 21, NZC chief executive Martin Snedden said Saturday. The ICC said in a statement late Saturday night that it will consider New Zealands plea over the coming days. Snedden said: The team wont go to Nairobi, weve advised the ICC of this and weve confirmed that we are willing to play the game at an alternative venue in South Africa  at whatever date the ICC might determine. From our point of view, theres only one issue to consider in all of this and that is player safety. You just cant allow yourself to be deviated in any other direction. New Zealand, who have had security concerns over playing the group B match in Kenya since a November bombing killed 16 people in Mombasa, have already warned they could appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne. However, Sri Lanka, also in New Zealands group, have said they have no problems playing in Kenya on February 24.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

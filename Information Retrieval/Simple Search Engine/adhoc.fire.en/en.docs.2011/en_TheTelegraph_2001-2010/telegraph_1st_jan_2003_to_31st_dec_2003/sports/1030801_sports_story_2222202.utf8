The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jeev third after steady start
New Delhi: Ace golfer Jeev Milkha Singh produced a spectacular opening round of six-under 66 to be tied for the third place in the 120-million yen Aiful Cup which began at the par-72 Twinfields Golf Club in Ishikawa, Japan Thursday. Jeev was in superb form as he completed the first half of his journey at five-under par, and would have finished the day on top of the leaderboard had it not been for an unfortunate bogey on his finishing hole. In contrast, Asias top player Jyoti Randhawa, the other Indian in fray, struggled to a one-over 73 and was tied for 109th place, according to information received here. Jeev started with a birdie on the par-five tenth hole and then saved strokes back-to-back on the 12th and 13th holes. Another brace of birdies on the 17th and 18th, saw him make the turn at five-under. On the back nine, yet another brace of birdies on the par-3 second and third took him to seven-under after 12 holes. Hidehisa Shikata started in a whirlwind fashion before two bogeys in his last two holes stopped his juggernaut. Shikata led the field at seven-under 65 along side Koki Idoki. Another Japanese player, Tetsuji Hiratsuka, was tied for the third place at 66 along with Jeev. (PTI)  Copyright

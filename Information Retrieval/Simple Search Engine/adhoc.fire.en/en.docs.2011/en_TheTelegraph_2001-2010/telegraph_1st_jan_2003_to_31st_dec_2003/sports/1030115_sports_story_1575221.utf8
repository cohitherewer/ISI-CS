		 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 Warne may be back next week: Buchanan
																								Brisbane: Shane Warne, recovering from a severe shoulder injury, may be back in international action as early as next week, Australian coach John Buchanan said here on Tuesday.																								It is highly likely he will feature during the finals of the tri-nations series, he said.																								The tri-series deciders are scheduled for Januray 23 and 25 and  if a third clash is needed  on January 27. Australia are almost certain to be in the finals, in which they will play England or Sri Lanka. Warne had surgery on his right bowling shoulder only a month ago after injuring it in a fielding accident.																								He made a promising return to the bowling crease last Friday when, after a nervous start, he settled down to take one for 53 off eight overs for Victoria in an inter-state match against Western Australia.																								Shanes recovery has been exceptionally good, Buchanan said. ... he will probably play in his states next one-day game  against Tasmania in Hobart on Sunday  and then after that we will consider when hell play for Australia. I would definitely hope he will play for us in the finals. It is still a little bit early to say definitely, but I would certainly hope so. Everybody has been surprised at the way he has gone through and then to be back where he is at the moment. We obviously dont want to rush things.. 																								Australia have decided to take Warne to South Africa even if he is not cent percent fit. In such a case, the leg spinner might be rested during the group league stage. (AFP)

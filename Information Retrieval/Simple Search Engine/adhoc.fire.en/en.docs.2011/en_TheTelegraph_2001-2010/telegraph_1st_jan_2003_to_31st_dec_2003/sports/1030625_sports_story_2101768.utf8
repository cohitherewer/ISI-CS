The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No fireworks at BCA meeting
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: With elections not being on the agenda, excitement was at a premium during Sundays annual meeting of the undivided Bihar Cricket Association in Jamshedpur. According to The Telegraphs sources, though, members did have some queries  namely, the status of Jharkhands affiliation to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the unfortunate happenings in the opening India versus West Indies ODI at the Keenan last November. Both were tackled by the president, Amitabh Choudhary. Choudhary, incidentally, will be making another trip to Calcutta for a one-to-one with BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya on the issue of Jharkhands affiliation. A court case in Chennai (of all places) has stalled the process of affiliation. As the elections will be held in 2004  on completion of the present office-bearers term of two years  Choudhary continues as president, with B.N. Singh and Govinda Mukherjee remaining secretary and treasurer, respectively.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Proposal for full points to visitors shot down 
  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Paarl: The International Cricket Councils (ICCs) cricket committee, management, which has very much the final say in off-the-field matters, has rejected a proposal to award full points to the visiting team should crowd disturbance render it impossible to complete a one-day International. We strongly opposed that move and, as it turned out, some of the other countries supported our stand, informed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary, S.K. Nair. The Duckworth/Lewis Method will continue to determine the winner should unusual circumstances force an abrupt finish. Talking to The Telegraph Monday afternoon, Nair (who represented India at the two-day session in Cape Town, ending Sunday) added that Match Referee Mike Procters decision to award last Novembers ODI versus the West Indies, to India, was ratified. Among other issues, recognising the Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) has again been put on hold. Besides India, that was opposed by Pakistan, Bangladesh and South Africa, Nair remarked. The slow over-rates, one understands, is being treated as a big area of concern. Apparently, a detailed presentation will be made during the ICCs annual general meeting (at Lords), in June.  Copyright

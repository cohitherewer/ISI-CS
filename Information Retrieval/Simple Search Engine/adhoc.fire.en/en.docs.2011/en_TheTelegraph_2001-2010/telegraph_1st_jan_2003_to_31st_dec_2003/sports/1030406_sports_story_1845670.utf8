The match started off on a promising note for Amanmuradova as she led 3-1 with a break of serve in the third game. The Indian managed a break in the sixth game to level the scores at three all. However, Rushmi dropped her own serve in the next game to trail 3-4 and the Uzbek held to increase the lead at 5-3. The Indian managed to hold but Amanmuradova served out the set at 6-4. The second set went almost on the same line as the first with the foreigner breaking Rushmi in the third game for a 2-1 lead. However, the Indian played better tennis and broke back immediately to level the scores at two all. The deciding set saw as many as seven break of serves in the final set before Amanmuradova wrapped up the match with the crucial break in the 12th game for a 7-5 verdict.  Copyright

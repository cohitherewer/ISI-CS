 Sampras decides to call it quits
 Sampras to announce retirement on  Monday New York: Pete Sampras, holder of a world record 14 Grand Slam titles, will announce his retirement on Monday. The 32-year-old former world No. 1 will officially make the announcement at a special ceremony on the opening day of the US Open, his agents IMG said in a statement. The American, whose 14 Grand Slam titles included an astonishing seven on Wimbledons grasscourts, has not played competitively since winning the US Open title last year. Sampras won five US Open crowns and two Australian Open titles to go with his seven Wimbledon victories, but could not win the French Open on the slow clay at Roland Garros. He failed to advance beyond the second round eight times in his 13 appearances in Paris, though he did reach the semi-finals there in 1996. However, it was a different story on the grass in London where he won the title seven times in an eight-year span from his first in 1993 until his last in 2000. The only blip was when Richard Krajicek beat him in the quarter finals on the Dutchmans way to the title in 1996. Sampras won his first Grand Slam title at the age of just 19 years and 28 days in the US Open in 1990, upsetting Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe and Andre Agassi in the final three rounds to become the youngest ever champion. He then proceeded to dominate the world rankings and in 1994 became the first player since Lendl in 1987 to hold the top spot throughout the year, while in 1998 he became the first man to finish the year as the world No. 1 for the sixth successive year. In 2000, he overcame shin and foot problems sustained in the second round to break Australian Roy Emersons record for most Grand Slam titles when he claimed his 13th by defeating Australian Pat Rafter in the Wimbledon final. On Monday, it seems the door will close for good.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

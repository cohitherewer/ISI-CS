 IOC to turn up heat 
Lausanne: The International Olympic Committees battle to rid future Olympics of drug cheats will move up a gear this week when the executive board is expected to give the go ahead to re-test samples taken during the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games. They will be tested for traces of the designer steroid THG. IOC president Jacques Rogge does not expect to see a flood of positive tests for THG when fresh tests are carried out on the Salt Lake City samples. We want to know if THG was already used at the (Salt Lake City) Games. I have a feeling, that it is a very localised issue, and not worldwide because this is a designer drug manufactured by a local lab (in the US). (AFP)  Copyright

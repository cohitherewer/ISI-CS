The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fans warned 
London: England could still be kicked out of the Euro 2004 soccer championships if fans dont behave, coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said on Thursday. The reality is that if something happens we are out of Euro 2004, Eriksson told a management conference. We have one yellow card and if we get another, it is a red one and were out. Support us and support us in the right way. (AP)  Copyright

 Champions Enclave incentive for Indians 
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Johannesburg: Sahara India Pariwar, sponsors of the Indian cricket team, have offered a huge incentive for winning the World Cup: Each player plus the coach, physio and physical trainer will be presented with fully furnished deluxe apartments in the Amby Valley Sahara Lake City, some 90 minutes away from Pune. According to a source of The Telegraph, the apartments have a market price of Rs 1.25 crore each. Well, few incentives can be more impressive. Incidentally, the apartments will be in one block and that will be christened The Champions Enclave. BCCI promises big bounty Meanwhile, the BCCI has announced a huge purse for the players for making it to the World Cup semi-finals, adds a Staff Reporter in Calcutta. Reaching the semi-final is no mean achievement and therefore, the BCCI will offer Rs 1.87 crore to the 15 players as reward, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said in a release. Dalmiya said the reward would be doubled to Rs 3.75 crore if the team reached the final and increased to 7.5 crore if India emerged champions after two decades. All this means each member of the squad is now assured of Rs 12.5 lakh. They will get 25 lakh each if they reach the final and 50 lakh each if India lift the Cup. Dalmiya added coach John Wright, physiotherapist Andrew Leipus and physical trainer Adrian le Roux would also be suitably rewarded once the World Cup gets over.  Copyright

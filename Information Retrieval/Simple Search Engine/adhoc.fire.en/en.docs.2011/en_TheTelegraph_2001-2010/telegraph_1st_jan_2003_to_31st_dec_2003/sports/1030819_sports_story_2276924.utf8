 Micheel bags his first Major
 Shaun Micheel embraces his trophy after winning the US PGA Championship at the Oak Hill Country Club on Sunday. (Reuters) Rochester: Shaun Micheel struck a brilliant seven-iron approach to two inches at the last to seal a shock win at the US PGA Championship on Sunday as Tiger Woods completed his worst major finish as a professional. Ranked 169th, the 34-year-old American journeyman became the seventh player to clinch the tournament at the first attempt, firing a closing level-par 70 to secure his maiden PGA Tour title by two shots. Micheel, who was holding a one-stroke lead when he hit his approach from the first cut of rough on 18, finished on four-under 276 at a sun-drenched Oak Hill Country Club. His tap-in for birdie earned him his first Grand Slam title in only his third start and, after raising his arms in celebration, he walked across the green to embrace his pregnant wife Stephanie before kneeling and gently kissing her belly. Micheels compatriot and playing partner Chad Campbell finished alone in second place at two under after carding a 72. South African Tim Clark, who made a fast start with three birdies in the first four holes, stumbled with four bogeys after the turn and had to settle for third position at one under after a 69. Germanys Alex Cejka was fourth at even par, also after a 69, while three-times major winner Ernie Els never gave himself enough birdie chances on the firming greens and carded a 71 for a share of fifth place with Jay Haas. I had a perfect yardage into 18 and the ball was sitting up, Micheel said of his second shot from 175 yards at the last. Woods completed his final round half an hour before the leaders teed off, carding a three-over-par 73. The 27-year-old American, struggling for accuracy off the tee all week, lost any chance of mounting a last-day charge with two bogeys in his first three holes, and dropped three more shots between the 10th and 15th. Although he finished strongly with birdies on 16 and at the last, lifting his meagre birdie haul for the week to six, finished at 12-over 292, tying for 39th place in a field of 69. It was a tough week and it was frustrating out there but Im so happy now that Im done, said Woods, who hit only eight of 14 fairways in the final round. If I wasnt making a 10-footer for par, I was making bogey somewhere. I didnt hit the ball as well as I needed to but I putted great all week. Unfortunately, they were all for pars and a few for bogeys. When youre not as precise as you need to be, its going to be tough. This golf course is just a brutal test. Its the hardest, fair golf course Ive ever played. Woods was bidding this week for his ninth career Major and his first since last years US Open. He has now completed his first season without a major victory since 1998.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

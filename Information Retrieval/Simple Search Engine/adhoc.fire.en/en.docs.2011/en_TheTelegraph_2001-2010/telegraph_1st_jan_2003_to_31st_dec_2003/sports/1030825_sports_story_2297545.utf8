 Wiltord brace in Arsenal win
London: Sylvain Wiltord scored twice as Arsenal romped to a 4-0 win at Middlesbrough on Sunday that put them level with champions Manchester United at the top of the English Premier League. Arsenal and United, who have an identical goal difference of five, and Chelsea are the only sides on maximum points after two matches. United and Chelsea both won 2-1 on Saturday, at Newcastle United and at home to Leicester City respectively. Aston Villa and Liverpool picked up their first points of the season in an entertaining 0-0 draw at Villa Park earlier on Sunday. Striker Thierry Henry put Arsenal in front in the fifth minute with a low right-foot shot after Boro keeper Mark Schwarzer had pushed away Freddie Ljungbergs attempt. Brazils Gilberto increased the lead when he drove home a low shot from a Robert Pires pass and Arsenal went three up when Wiltord scored from Henrys cross from the left. Wiltord made it four on the hour.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

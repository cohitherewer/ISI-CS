 Six weeks for Lawson to rectify action
 Jermaine Lawson St. Johns: West Indies fast bowler Jermaine Lawson has six weeks to correct his bowling action under an order delivered Tuesday by the International Cricket Council. The order follows a report by umpires David Shepherd and Srinivas Venkatraghavan after reviewing television footage during Lawsons seven for 78 on the first day of the Test against Australia. ICC Match Referee Mike Procter said the 21-year-old fast bowler will be allowed to play during the six weeks, after which he will be reviewed. Procter said there were no reports on Lawson in the two previous Tests he played. Under the rules, the ball must be bowled not thrown, and the players elbow must not be straightened once at shoulder level. Former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding said he could name a half dozen bowlers with illegal actions in international cricket and called for the ICC to take action against them. Im happy that theyre looking at Jermaine Lawson because I do not feel that anyone should have an unfair advantage, Holding said. But do not single out one individual. Lets deal with the entire crop. He said he would not name the others because he feared lawsuits. Holding was a member of the disbanded ICC committee on throwing. The West Indies Cricket Board has appointed him to be special adviser to work with Lawson over the next six weeks. West Indies captain and star batsman Brian Lara has acknowledged his playershave been batting well but need to improve their bowling. The speed pressure Meanwhile, West Indies Cricket Board president Wes Hall said Tuesday the pressure to break the 100 mph bowling barrier is causing some bowlers to fall out of line with crickets throwing rules. It is quite possible with all the hype surrounding 100 mph youngsters will strive and go beyond the bounds, said Hall, a fast bowler who set records between 1958 and 1969. We need to look at that.

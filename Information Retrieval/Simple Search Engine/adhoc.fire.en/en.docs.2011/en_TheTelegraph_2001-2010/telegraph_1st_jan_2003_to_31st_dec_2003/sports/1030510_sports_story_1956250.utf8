 Tim warns Greene
Osaka: World 100 metres record holder Tim Montgomery warned arch-rival Maurice Greene on Friday that he planned to erase all his marks from the record books. Montgomery, who clocked 9.78 seconds in Paris last September to better his fellow-Americans mark, vowed that he would break another Greene record when he contests his second 100 metres of the season at the Japan Grand Prix on Saturday. Maurice Greene has the record (9.91) at this event and my goal is to break that. All the records Maurice Greene had... Im trying to wipe his name off the map, said the 28-year-old. Montgomery, who finished second to Canadian Nicholas Macrozonaris with a time of 10.04 in Mexico City last weekend in his first race since Paris, told reporters he relished the challenge of being the man to beat in 2003. It pushes me even harder because the expectations are high. But I accept that challenge, he said. My motivational tool is to look at the world record, look at what made me great, and strengthen everything that was weak in that race. I look forward to breaking the world record again. Montgomery also tipped himself to win gold at the world championships in Paris this August. It doesnt feel right to be the world record holder and to lose the world championships.

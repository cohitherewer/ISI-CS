 Becks: One for the manager
Sunderland: England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson hailed his teams 2-0 victory over Turkey on Wednesday and promised fans they would be seeing more of teenage striker Wayne Rooney. Eriksson, whose side had been criticised in the British media after a laboured 2-0 win over Liechtenstein on Saturday said: The team, the squad were excellent. When we came together, we said we wanted six points and we took them. The performance today was absolutely fantastic  a good first half and an even better second half. Against very difficult opponents, they played really very good football. The importance of winning this game is huge, Eriksson said. Eriksson, who said he had decided on Sunday to start with Rooney after his performance against Liechtenstein, was vindicated in his decision to use the teenager. He was excellent and he showed he was ready for the big games, said the Swede. Police arrested 95 England fans before their teams match. Police charged at England fans outside the Stadium of Light minutes before the game after they tried to prevent Turkish supporters entering the ground, the BBC reported. England captain David Beckham said their win was one for the manager but added that he always knew they could do it.Beckham said: It was a performance that was for the manager because he has had a lot of stick these last couple weeks. I would like to think we have done it for him. Beckham was also impressed by Rooneys contribution, saying: I was asked last week if Wayne was ready to come into the team and play at international level and tonight he showed that he can and doesnt need me to answer those questions. For a lad who has just turned 17 it was exceptional.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

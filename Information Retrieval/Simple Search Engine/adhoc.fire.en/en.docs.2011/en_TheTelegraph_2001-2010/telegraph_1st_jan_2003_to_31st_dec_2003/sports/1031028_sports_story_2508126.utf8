 SA set 302-run target for Pak
 Gary Kirsten after his century on Monday. (AFP) Faisalabad: Gary Kirsten hit his 19th century on Monday as South Africa set Pakistan a target of 302 runs to win the second Test. With the hosts already 1-0 up in the two-match series, Pakistan ended the fourth day on eight without loss in six overs and needing another 294 runs. South Africa had declared their second innings after tea on 371 for eight, Kirstens sparkling 118 runs from 232 balls and in 316 minutes (11 fours and one six) bringing them back into the match. Taufeeq Umar and Imran Farhat, who have posted three successive century stands for Pakistan in the series, held firm before bad light forced play to end four overs early and left the match intriguingly poised. It was Kirstens second century on this ground and allowed South Africa to dictate terms on a sluggish day of cricket. Leg-spinner Danish Kaneria did the bulk of the work with 27 consecutive overs, in contrast to veteran leggie Mushtaq Ahmed who bowled just four overs. Kirsten resumed on 27, with South Africa on 140 for three. He played a flawless innings and shared valuable stands of 90 with Jacques Kallis (43, 113 balls, three boundaries), a new record for the fifth wicket against Pakistan, and 85 from 211 balls with Neil McKenzie (35) before lunch. During the day Taufeeq became the first Pakistani player to take six catches in a Test.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

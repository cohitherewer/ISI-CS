 East Bengal are unlikely to risk Douglas da  Silva for the forthcoming Super League play-off final against  Mohun Bagan on November 2. The club sources informed that  though the Brazilian is recovering well, East Bengal would  prefer to go in with Mike Okoro and Suley Musah for the  game. In fact, Douglas is unlikely to be registered for  the Durand Cup as well. Douglas will be with the squad  all right, but since we cannot play more than two foreigners,  he may not be registered, a club official said.				 																																																	 Mohun Bagan are in a dilemma whether to take part in the forthcoming Durand Cup. The team is carrying too many injuries and a decision will be taken on Sunday. Ill sit down with the Special Officers and decide whether we can send a team for the Durand Cup, assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury said.				 																																																	While Jose Ramirez Barreto is nursing an injury, Debkumar Sashmal, Basudeb Mondal and Sanjeeb Maria are down with jaundice.				 																																																	Meanwhile, the club has been told by Fifa that if they clear Isa Musah Erojes dues by Tuesday, they will be free to take foreign players.				 																																																	 The 14-member Bengal under-15 squad for the forthcoming Polly Umrigar Trophy was announced on Friday. Bengal open their engagements against Tripura on October 31.				 																																																	Meanwhile, the Bengal under-15 teams tie versus Bangladesh on Friday was washed out.  SQUAD				 																																																	Rohan Banerjee (capt) Srivats Goswami, Writam Porel, Kunal Chowdhury, Abhishek Bhowmick, Joydeep Roy, Bajlur Rahman, Soumya Pakre, Abhik Adhikari, Chandan Paul, Tarak Mistry, Debopriyo Ghosh, Santanu Das, Bappaditya Ghosh. Coach: Moloy Banerjee.

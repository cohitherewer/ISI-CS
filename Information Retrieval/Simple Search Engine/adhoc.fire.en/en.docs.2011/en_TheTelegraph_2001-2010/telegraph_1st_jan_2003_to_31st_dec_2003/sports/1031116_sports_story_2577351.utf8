 India offer OK, but bid rule in review 
Montego Bay, Nov. 15 (AP): The Commonwealth Games Federation has said it will review its rules on bidding after Canada cried foul over Indias selection to host the 2010 Games. New Delhi was chosen by secret ballot on Thursday night, beating out rival Hamilton, Ontario, in a bid that included a last-minute offer of $ 7.2 million in training funds to all 72 Commonwealth nations. Hamilton, which had earlier announced its own training scholarship worth $ 3.8 million, cried foul and accused India of buying votes. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell of Jamaica said he met with both delegations on Friday to discuss ways of avoiding future conflict in the bidding process. Fennell said everyone agreed the rules should be clearer on the matter of updating bids just prior to the vote, but he denied India did anything wrong. We will review the whole process to see how we can do it better, Fennell said on Friday. Obviously theres a lot of excitement and a lot of disappointment in the aftermath (of the vote)... But Im satisfied that we did things according to our rules. Fennell added he told the IOA that the distribution of the $ 7.2 million must be handled through the Commonwealth Games Federation to ensure transparency. Randhir re-elected Meanwhile, IOA secretary Randhir Singh was Saturday unanimously re-elected Commonwealth Games Federation vice president from the Asian region for another term of four years.

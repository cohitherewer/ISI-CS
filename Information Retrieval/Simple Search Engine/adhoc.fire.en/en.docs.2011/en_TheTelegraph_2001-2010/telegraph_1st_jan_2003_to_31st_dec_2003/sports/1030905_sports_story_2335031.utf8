The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Star-spangled field in fray 
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: Anju Bobby George, the Paris World Championship bronze medallist long jumper, is unlikely to be around (because of her international commitments), but the rest of the Indian stars of track and field will be on show as the 43rd inter-state meet gets underway at the JRD Tata Sports Complex here Friday. The showpiece 100m events will be held on the opening day which will see 14 finals. The second and third days will see the finals of 26 events. Around 700 athletes from 23 states will participate in the 44 events in the mens and womens categories. The team for the Asian Track and Field meet in Manila later this month will be selected from these championships. The star athletes to have reached the city are Neelam J. Singh, Bahadur Singh, K.M. Beenamol (800m), Sunita Rani, Saraswati Saha and Soma Biswas.  Copyright

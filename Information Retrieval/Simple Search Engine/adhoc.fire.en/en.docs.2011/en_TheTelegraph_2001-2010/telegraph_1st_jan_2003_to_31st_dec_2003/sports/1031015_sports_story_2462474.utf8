The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Navratilova gets a berth
 Martina will be the oldest in Fed Cup history New York: Martina Navratilova, who turns 47 on Thursday, was named to the US Fed Cup team along with Lisa Raymond, Meghann Shaughnessy and Alexandra Stevenson. Captain Billie Jean King on Monday assembled a second-string squad lacking all five of the Americans ranked in the WTA top 10  Serena and Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati and Chanda Rubin. But it might be enough to defeat Belgium in the semi-final on November 19-20 in Moscow because world No. 1 Kim Clijsters and No. 2 Justine Henin-Hardenne have said they will not play for the Belgians. The two top players were unhappy that Russia, who meet France in the other semi-final, won the bid to host the Fed Cup final rather than the Belgian bid. The US team spiced its line-up by including Navratilova, who is undefeated in Fed Cup singles and doubles, posting a 37-0 record. Navratilova will compete in the event for the first time since 1995 and become the oldest player to ever compete in the 40-year history of the meet. (AFP)  Copyright

 Martyn buries Bangla
 - SECOND ODI l Ninth-fastest fifty by Aussie right-hander  Damien Martyn in action in Cairns on Sunday. (AFP) Cairns: Damien Martyn blasted an unbeaten 92 off 51 balls to lead Australia to a nine-wicket victory over Bangladesh on Sunday. The home team thus took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. Martyn, who made 88 not out in the World Cup final win over India in March despite a broken finger, showed he was back to full fitness and form. The 31-year-old stroked the ball effortlessly through the infield on both sides of the wicket, amassing 15 boundaries and one six as Australia cruised to victory with 29.4 overs to spare. Bangladesh captain Khaled Mahmud opted to bat first but, after a promising start, the tourists were all out for 147 in 45.1 overs. Australia lost Andrew Symonds for seven to make the score 17 for one. Martyn came in and dominated a 131-run stand for the second wicket with the other stand-in opener Michael Bevan, who made 40 not out. Martyn clubbed three fours and a six in successive balls off Mahmud in the 10th over of the innings. His six over long-on was almost caught by a young sightscreen attendant who fumbled the head-high chance. The Western Australian right-hander, who missed the West Indies tour as his fractures healed and made 0 not out on Saturday, completed ninth-fastest half-century in one-day Internationals off 22 balls. The Cairns crowd anxiously waited to see if Martyn could reach his hundred but two boundaries by left-hander Bevan in the 19th over made it impossible for his partner. Bangladeshs innings fell apart under the spell of left-arm spinners Brad Hogg and Darren Lehmann who both recorded career-best one-day International figures. The tourists lost their first four wickets for 19 runs in Saturdays eight-wicket defeat but Hannan Sarkar and Javed Omar put on 37 in 14 overs on Sunday. Sarkar fell chasing a wide ball from Ian Harvey and was caught-behind for 19. Omar departed three overs later when he was caught-behind off Andy Bichel for 11. Sanwar Hossain (3) chipped an easy catch to Ricky Ponting at mid-wicket off Hogg to make the score 52 for three. The left-arm wrist spinner then had Al-Sahariar caught at deep mid-wicket for eight and Tushar Imran caught at mid-off for two in successive overs as Bangladesh slumped to 86 for five. Allrounder Symonds had success in his first over when he caught and bowled Habibul Bashar for 31 and Mahmud was run out for 11 by a direct hit at the bowlers end from Lehmann. Left-arm orthodox spinner Lehmann, playing in his 100th one-day International, had Tapash Baisya (2) and Mohammad Rafique (6) caught in the deep by Bevan. Alok Kopali then holed out to Damien Martyn off Lehmann in the 46th over after top-scoring with 34. The third and final match of the series will be played in Darwin on Wednesday.

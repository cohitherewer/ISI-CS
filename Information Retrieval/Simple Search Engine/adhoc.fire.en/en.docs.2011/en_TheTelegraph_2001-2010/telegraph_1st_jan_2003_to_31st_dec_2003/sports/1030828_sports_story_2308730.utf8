 Court dismisses plea against life ban
 Legal setback for Mohammed Azharuddin  Hyderabad: Former India skipper Mohammed Azharuddin  suffered a setback in his legal battle Wednesday when a  city court dismissed his suit challenging the life ban imposed  on him by the BCCI in the wake of match fixing allegations.  A brief order dismissing Azhars suit was pronounced  by the second additional chief judge of the city civil court  Dasaramaiah, a BCCI counsel A. Venkatesh said. As things stand, our (BCCI) ban on Azharuddin stands, the counsel said adding it was for the plaintiff to decide the future course. Azhar had filed the suit in December 2000 challenging the ban from all international cricket for life and made the BCCI, CBI deputy director K. Madhavan, who had probed the match fixing scandal and former BCCI chief A. C. Muthiah as respondents. When contacted, Azhars counsel said: We are yet to receive a copy of the judgement and cannot comment on the grounds under which the suit has been dismissed. Azhar was not available for comment and his office here maintained that he was out of station.  (PTI)  Copyright

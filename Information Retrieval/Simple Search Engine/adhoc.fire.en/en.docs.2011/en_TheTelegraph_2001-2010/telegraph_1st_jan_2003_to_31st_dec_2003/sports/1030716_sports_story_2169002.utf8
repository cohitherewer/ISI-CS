 IFA discards play-off final 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The IFA has decided to do away with the play-off final in the Super Division from this season. The association took the decision following suggestions from governing body members. A top IFA official informed they had written to the members of the governing body, asking for their suggestions on this. Most of them have communicated that they dont want the play-off final, the official said, adding: The finals unnecessarily prolong the league. According to the old rule, the Super Division would go into the play-off stage if the difference between the top two teams was less than three points. The official added the decision is subject to ratification in the governing body meeting. But the play-off matches in other divisions will continue as usual.  Copyright

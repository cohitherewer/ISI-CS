The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jugraj is my Player of Year
 - Gagan Ajit, Chauhan and Tirkey also impressed in a stand-out  2003 for India
 Stickwork / Gurbax Singh Jugraj is out of action but never  out of our minds We are just days away from ushering  in a new year. Its time to take stock of the balance sheet,  what all we have achieved and what we can look forward to.  For the Indian hockey team, 2003 threw up more roses than  thorns. Three triumphs in five tournaments was possible  only because we have been able to develop the healthy habit  of winning matches consistently. Mastering mighty Australia in  the second of two invitational meets in their backyard was  a significant success. We also topped a four-nation tournament  in German land (Hamburg). In the years biggest event (Champions  Trophy), though, India were placed fourth out of six teams.  A much better performance didnt materialise simply because  we couldnt maintain the same high standards in every game. More recently, the Indians struck  gold at the Asia Cup and the inaugural Afro-Asian Games,  both at the expense of Pakistan which confirmed our new-found  spirit and resolve.  The malady of conceding late goals  to throw away games we had no business losing seems to be  a thing of the past. Thats the most refreshing change the  Class of 2003 has brought about, something which should  come in handy in the year of the Olympics. Talking of individuals who have  had the maximum influence in transforming a talented unit  into a feared one, two names stand head and shoulders above  the rest: Jugraj Singh and Gagan Ajit Singh. If I were to  pick a third player, my nomination would go jointly to Devesh  Chauhan and Dilip Tirkey. Let me justify my choices one  by one. Jugraj has been out of action  since September, ever since he suffered multiple fractures  in a frightful car accident. Despite missing both the Asia  Cup and the Afro-Asian Games, he is my Player of the Year. The biggest virtue of this young  man from Punjab is his willingness to give 200 per cent  in every game. His never-say-die spirit helps him come out  on top of most one-to-one situations, be it defending or  taking penalty corner hits. The amount of positive energy  he radiates on the field rubs off on teammates and, at the  same time, frustrates the opposition. A much-improved half-back since  his junior days, the lion-hearted Jugraj is among the top  drag-flickers in the world  in the same league as Pakistani  Sohail Abbas and Argentine Jorge Lombi. Converting penalty  corners is an important aspect of modern hockey and the  Indian team has come to rely heavily on the Jugrajs skills. No less important is the defence  of penalty corners. And Jugraj is second to none in this  aspect. The way he rushes out directly at the striker and  denies him a clear look at goal makes the custodians job  easier and lifts the whole team. One gets inspired even  watching him on television. The only criticism of Jugraj is  that he gets over-excited and over-involved at times, tending  to lose his temper. That can at times have an adverse effect  on the team, like his suspension in the Busan Asian Games  final against South Korea. He shouldnt curb his aggro,  but neither should he do anything silly to invite the umpires  wrath. Jugarj can be an asset to the  team for years to come, but let him not rush back to the  game. He should return only when he is 100 per cent fit,  nothing less. I can understand his eagerness to hold a hockey  stick after a long lay-off but he must realise that if he  picks up another injury while playing at, say, 60 per cent  fitness, his career could be over. If temperament happens to be Jugrajs  enemy from time to time, it is Gagan Ajits best virtue.  Undoubtedly the best reverse-stick striker in the world,  he is like the silent assassin. He gets into good scoring  positions and, more ominously for the opposition, also creates  scoring opportunities out of nothing. He scored some memorable  goals this year, quite a few of which came when India were  staring at defeat. The presence of such a high-quality  striker means the team can turn around a game in next to  no time. The fact that he doesnt ever get ruffled adds  to Gagan Ajits value as he can deal with a tough on-field  situation with aplomb.  The Pakistanis, who have suffered  most from his deadly stick in recent months, have tried  to provoke him into losing his cool and rhythm without any  success. All that Gagan Ajit needs to do  is strengthen his right-side hitting which would make him  a more potent force. From what I saw in the Afro-Asian Games,  he is consciously working on that area and the results should  soon start to come. I rated Chauhan and Tirkey on  a par, but first Ill talk of Chauhan. The goalkeeper has  improved by leaps and bounds over the past 18 months, so  much so that the team has started depending on his abilities  to put up a solid last front.  He oscillated from being outstanding  one moment to ordinary the next, letting in some silly goals.  But that, fortunately, is no longer the case now. The way  he has defended penalty corners, in Jugrajs absence, has  been a real boost to the team. The fact that Jugraj, Gagan Ajit  and Chauhan are contemporaries who graduated from the 2001  junior World Cup-winning team is a big advantage to the  coach. They understand each other and gell well as a unit. Tirkey, the senior pro along with  Dhanraj Pillay, has matured with age and shrugged off a  lean patch he had last year and at the start of 2003. He  was always a good tackler who got into good positions. Like  Gagan Ajit, he possesses a fine temperament and is an asset  to the team in tough games. Its very important for Tirkey  to maintain his good form as there are no immediate replacements.  Someone like Kanwalpreet Singh has great potential as full-back,  but he is very raw and will take time to settle down. Copyright

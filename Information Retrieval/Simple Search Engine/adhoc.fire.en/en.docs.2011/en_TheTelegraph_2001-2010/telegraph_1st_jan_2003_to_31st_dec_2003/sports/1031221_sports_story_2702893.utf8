The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zaheer back at training 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Hobart, Dec. 20: Zaheer Khan, who missed the  second Test (Adelaide) owing to a strained left hamstring,  had his first sprints-session in almost ten days this afternoon.  The workout, of course, was under physio Andrew Leipus  supervision at the Bellerive Oval.  Later, Zaheer told The Telegraph:  I didnt over-exert myself... I think my body responded  well... Yes, hopefully, I should play the third Test (Melbourne,  from December 26)... Assuming he is fit, Irfan Pathan will  have to join the reserves. Zaheer, it may be recalled, took five for 95 in innings No.1 of the first Test (Brisbane). Meanwhile, coach John Wright is confident that top gun Sachin Tendulkar will fire in the two Tests that remain. He scored only 36 in the first innings (versus Australia A) here, but felt good... Surely, its a matter of time before he gets among the runs in a big way.  In the first two Tests, Sachin has managed 0, 1 and  37.  Copyright

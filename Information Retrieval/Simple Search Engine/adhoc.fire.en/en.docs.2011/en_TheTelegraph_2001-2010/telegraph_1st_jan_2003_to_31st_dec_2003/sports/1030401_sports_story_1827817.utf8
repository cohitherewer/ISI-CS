The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. down Punjab Police 2-0
Jamshedpur: Mohammedan Sporting overwhelmed Punjab Police 2-0 while Hayward Sporting from Goa came from behind to defeat Allwyn Hindustan, Delhi, 2-1 in their group B matches of the second division National Football League on Monday. Mohammedan Sporting mounted pressure on the Punjab Police right from the beginning making several forays into the rival goal. However, they had to wait till the 31st minute when their overseas recruit Eugene Gray headed home the first goal. After the lemon break, the Punjab side upped their momentum in search of an equaliser but Mohammedan defended their fort with alertness. Six minutes from time, the Calcutta outfit, however, increased the margin when substitute A. Sarkar found the net with a powerful shot. In the other match, Allwyn Hindustan started off well, but could not score in the first half. However, the Delhi team deservedly went ahead with the 52nd strike from Abdulateef Seriki. But their celebration was shortlived as Hayward striker C. Jatin Singh restored parity within eight minutes. Thereafter, both teams made some aggressive soccer and came close to scoring, but Hayward had the last laugh when a Peter Pereira pass deflected off an Allwyn defender to go into the goal.

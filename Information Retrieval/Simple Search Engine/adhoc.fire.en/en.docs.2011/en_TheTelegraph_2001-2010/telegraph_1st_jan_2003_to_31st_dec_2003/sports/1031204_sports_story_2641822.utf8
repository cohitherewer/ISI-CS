The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kale moves Mumbai HC
Mumbai: Maharashtra batsman Abhijit Kale on Wednesday filed an appeal in the Mumbai High Court challenging an order of the Pune District Court upholding his suspension by the BCCI following bribery allegations by national selectors. Kale urged that pending the BCCI inquiry, he should be allowed to play first class cricket. He pleaded that the BCCI should be directed to complete the inquiry within a stipulated time. Justice Dilip Bhosale, however, deferred his verdict until Thursday as the report of the BCCI inquiry is awaited. Kales lawyer Janak Dwarkadas pleaded that pending the BCCI inquiry, the cricketer should be allowed to play and said the suspension was a stigma on his career. BCCI lawyer Goolam Vahanvati said pending a preliminary inquiry Kale had been suspended and the BCCI had a right to take such action. Kale was suspended by the BCCI after national selectors Kiran More and Pranab Roy accused him of offering money for a place in the Indian team. D.V. Subba Rao, probing the scandal on behalf of the BCCI, has sent his report to the Board, a day ahead of the deadline. I have sent the report to the BCCI office in Calcutta, Rao, also the chairman of the Bar Council of India, said from Visakhapatnam. I have done my job. It is now for the BCCI to decide the next course of action, Rao said. The report, prepared in just three days, will now be forwarded to the BCCI disciplinary committee. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mani boost for Bangla 
Dhaka: Cricket chiefs conceded on Tuesday that Bangladesh should have been given more help as a young Test side but said victory for them over the next two years would justify the decision to let them play at the top level. Hindsight has great advantage, International Cricket Council president Ehsan Mani said. They did very well in their first game against India but have fallen away quite dramatically since then. They are, however, a member of the ICC and we can only think of ways to take them forward. Bangladesh became crickets 10th Test nation in 2000 and have lost 25 and drawn one of their 26 matches. They have not won a one-day International in a world-record 46 attempts, their last success dating back to 1999.  (Reuters)  Copyright

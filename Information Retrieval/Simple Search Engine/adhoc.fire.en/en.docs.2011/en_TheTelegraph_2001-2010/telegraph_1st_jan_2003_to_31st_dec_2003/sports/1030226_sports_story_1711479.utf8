The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India A beat Trinidad
New Delhi: India A came from behind to register a comfortable six-wicket win over Trinidad and Tobago in the Carib Beer Cup in Trinidad Monday, according to information received here. In a match marked by poor umpiring and flayed tempers, India A won the four-day contest with opener MoM Connor Williams (89) and the spinners chipping in. In reply to Trinidads 261 in the first innings, the tourists managed only 215. But they dismissed the hosts for 181 in the second before overhauling the target in 66.5 overs. L. Balaji and Avishkar Salvi took four each in the first innings but Amit Mishra (five for 30) and Murali Kartik (four for 57) did the damage in the second.  Copyright

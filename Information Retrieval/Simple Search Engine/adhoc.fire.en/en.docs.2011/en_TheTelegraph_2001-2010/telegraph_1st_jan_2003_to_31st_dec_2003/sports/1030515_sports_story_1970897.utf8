 BRIEFS
 dismissed England captain Nasser Hussain on the way to a hattrick in a County Championship match on Wednesday.The 20-year-old Lancashire seamer removed Essex opener Darren Robinson and trapped Hussain leg-before with a full-length delivery before returning to snare England hopeful Will Jefferson with the first ball of his next over.Anderson, Englands most successful bowler in this years World Cup with ten wickets, is expected to make his Test debut has been asked to meet with his fellow golf professionals next week to explain his outburst in Italy after refusing to accept a penalty for slow play.The chairman of the European PGA Players Committee, Mark James, said after a three-hour meeting here that they had decided against any immediate sanctions to allow the Spaniard the chance to explain himself.Ballesteros lost his cool at the Italian Open two weeks ago when he was penalised one-stroke for slow-play. The former Open and Masters champion, who has struggled woefully with his form in recent years, refused to accept the penalty and changed his score before signing his card. He was immediately disqualified.He then launched a scathing attack against the tour organisers saying they were like a mafia who athletes could unite to form a single team for the 2010 Winter Olympics if the Pyeongchang bid is successful, the president of the bids organising committee said on Wednesday.We believe its possible, Kim Jin-sun, who is also governor of the Kangwon province in South Korea, told Reuters in an interview. A joint national team is a possibility we want to see realised. Personally, Im convinced that this will work.North and South Korean athletes marched together under a flag of unification in the opening ceremony at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and again at last years Asian Games, but then competed as two separate teams. We could go much further than in Sydney, with a joint national team, joint sports training camps and a joint cheerleading squad, may help reduce injuries to footballers and athletes, according to a British company. Foot injuries caused by running and jumping on hard surfaces are common among athletes and many sports stars have injuries in areas of the foot just above the shoe studs.But technology development company Generics Group in Cambridge believe they may have a solution.Generics has come up with a new boot that it believes will solve these problems  a boot with spring-loaded studs, New Scientist magazine said on Wednesday.Any force on the stud causes the springy plate to flex into the boot, absorbing energy as it bends and reducing the pressure on the foot at that point.Tests at Generics laboratory showed the springy studs cut pressure on parts of the sole of the foot, when they hit hard ground, by 30 per cent. The company is talking Phillip Adams has had his two-year suspension for drug use overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Adams, 57, tested positive to the banned diuretic hydrochlorothiazide in the lead-up to last years Commonwealth Games in Manchester.Sport on Screen

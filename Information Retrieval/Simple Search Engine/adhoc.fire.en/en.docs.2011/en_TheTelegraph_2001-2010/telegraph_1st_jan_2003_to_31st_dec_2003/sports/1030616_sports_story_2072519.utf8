 ICC unhappy with GCC claim
London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) faces a 50 million compensation claim from the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), reports have said. The GCC, rights holder for the ICC World Cup and Champions Trophy events till 2007, has asked for a ninth of the $550 million it paid, citing breach of contract by England and New Zealand (who withdrew from World Cup matches in Zimbabwe and Kenya) and the conditional signing of Player Terms by India, The Independent reported Sunday. The ICC conceded it would have to forfeit some money but was unhappy with larger sections of the GCCs claim, the report said. The ICC has withheld the guarantee money due to England, New Zealand and India in anticipation of compensation claims. It might be in the right to ask England and New Zealand to bear the costs, but any such request might be contended by the BCCI. (PTI)  Copyright

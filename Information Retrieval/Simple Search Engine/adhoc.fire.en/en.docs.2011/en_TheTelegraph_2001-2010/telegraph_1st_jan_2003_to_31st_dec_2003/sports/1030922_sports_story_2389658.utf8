Picture by Santosh Ghosh  Calcutta: It rained national  records on the penultimate day of the 57th national aquatic  championships at the Subhas Sarobar pool. Of the eight events  in which gold medals were decided on Sunday, all but one  saw a new mark. It was the days final race  mens 100m breaststroke  which generated the maximum excitement and full-throated cheering. Simply because a local boy was in the field and with a decent chance of bagging a medal. Gairik Bardhan didnt disappoint the close-to-thousand wildly cheering audience. He earned the silver and, with a bit of luck, could have gone one better. The man to deny him was Polices Deepak Singh. Deepak stopped the clock at 1:08.91, Gairik returned a career-best 1:08.80.Gairik thus became the first Bengal swimmer to go below 1:10.00 in 100 backstroke. Earlier, another friendly rivalry between local divers Mamoni Mondal and Taniya Ganguly produced a rather one-sided contest. Mamoni was much the better performer on the day and won by a margin of nearly 20 points. The redoubtable Nisha Millet set the ball rolling, winning the 1500 freestyle hands down and adding one more record in her name. She clocked 18:42.72 to better Ambika Iyengars 2002 mark of 18:56.42.

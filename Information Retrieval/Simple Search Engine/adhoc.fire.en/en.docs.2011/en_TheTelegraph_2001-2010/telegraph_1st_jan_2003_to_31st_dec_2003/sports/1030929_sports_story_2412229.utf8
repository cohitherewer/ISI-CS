 BCCI withholds participation in Super Series
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to withhold participation in the proposed Super Series. According to president Jagmohan Dalmiya, the decision has been taken till such time the controversies surrounding the IDI contracts dispute were sorted out. Dalmiya, speaking at the end of the annual general meeting BCCI, also said that Indias participation could not be confirmed till the full terms and conditions of the Super Series were known. The International Cricket Council (ICC) has put forward a proposal for the Super Series that constitutes one five-day game and three limited-overs matches. The four games will pit the ICCs No.1 ranked teams in Tests and ODIs against the Rest of World in both forms. The first edition of the Super Series has been proposed from September 15 to 27, 2005. A decision on another ICC proposal, Project USA  a tri-series to be held twice in three years in the country  has also been withheld by the BCCI for similar reasons. The BCCI also expressed concern over the volume of international cricket and decided that it would make a strong representation to the ICC to spread the ten-year programme to a period of 12 to 14 years. The current programme is too cramped and tough for the players, Dalmiya said. It was decided that former India middle-order batsman Pravin Amre will be the chairman of the junior national selection committee. Orissas Ranjib Biswal will be Easts representative. The National Cricket Academy (NCA) will be restructured to give it a more professional outlook. The NCA will move out of Chinnaswamy Stadium and the BCCI will acquire 15 acres of land. The NCA will be converted into a research centre and laboratory for producing quality cricketers, Dalmiya remarked. The BCCI has rejected a proposal for amalgamation from the Womens Cricket Association of India (WCAI) in 2005, but decided to lend a helping in all matters.

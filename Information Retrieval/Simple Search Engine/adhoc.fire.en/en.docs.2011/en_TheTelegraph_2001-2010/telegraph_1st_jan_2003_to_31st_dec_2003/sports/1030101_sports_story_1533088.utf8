		 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Shahryar back as Pak manager
																								Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board on Tuesday sacked the tough-talking Brig (retd) Khwaja Mohammad Nasir as the team manager and appointed retired diplomat Shahryar Khan in his place for the World Cup.																								Khan, a respected career diplomat and a former Foreign Secretary, Ambassador and High Commissioner, has been appointed Pakistan team manager for the World Cup, an official announcement by the PCB said.																								Khan was also manager of the Pakistan team that toured India in early 1999. Nasir got into troubled waters after making unwarranted comments like accusing India of avoiding playing Pakistan for fear of defeat. The PCB disowned the statement.																								The PCB expects Khan, the polished diplomat that he is, to play a refined role in motivating the players to prepare for the mega-event.  (PTI)

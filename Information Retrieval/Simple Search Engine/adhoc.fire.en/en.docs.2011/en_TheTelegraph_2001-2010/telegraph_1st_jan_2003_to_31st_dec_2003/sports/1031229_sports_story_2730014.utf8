The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barreto brace gives Bagan point
 - Goan outfit fails to counter Brazilians brilliance  Barreto got the equaliser in the 54th minute Margao: Mohun Bagan rode Jose Ramirez Barretos brilliance to a 2-2 draw in their National Football League (NFL) clash with Haywards Sporting Club here on Sunday. Mohun Bagan now have 11 points and Sporting eight from six matches each. In an evenly-matched, fast-paced game, several scoring opportunities were created at both ends not all of which were utilised. The skilful Brazilian scored the first goal before the home team struck twice. It was Barreto again who got the Calcutta outfit the equaliser in the second session. Barreto created panic in the Sporting defence whenever he moved into the penalty area. He put Mohun Bagan one up in the 12th minute, slotting home from the top of the box a deflection which came to him following a Leonardo shot. The Goans, who stretched their famed rivals in both sessions, restored parity three minutes later when Dudu Omagbemi capitalised on a defensive error. Defenders Sanjeev Maria and Rishi Kapoor failed to clear a cross from Francis Andrade and Dudu made no mistake in nodding the ball home. The Mohun Bagan defence looked jittery after conceding the equaliser and Dudu had a glorious chance to put his team 2-1 up, but he headed wide off a long lob by Vincent Pires. Goalkeeper Prasanta Dora then effected a fine save, blocking a sharp attempt by Jotin who had been set up by Dudu. The Sporting midfielders showed good cohesion and kept feeding the strikers. Their efforts paid off in the 32nd minute when Mohun Bagan conceded a free-kick goal. The free-kick was awarded when Dora charged out to tackle Dudu and handled the ball outside the box. Andrade guided the ball into the net to send the crowd into raptures. Barreto, who moved into the strikers role, threatened the Sporting citadel time and again. He set up Ashim Biswas on the right, but the latter was unlucky to see his try hit the bar. Two minutes later, Biswas back-volley was blocked by custodian Luis Barreto. After change of ends, the Goans squandered a chance to increase the lead when Louis Aniwete missed the mark from close range. Mohun Bagan got desperate for the equaliser, and Barreto pounced on an opportunity to score in the 54th minute with an angular drive after Biswas had done the spadework. A little later, Louis came up with a spectacular save to deny Mohun Bagan the winner. The Sporting goalie leapt high to punch the ball over off a shot from Hardeep Gill who had received a pinpoint through pass from Barreto.  (PTI)  Copyright

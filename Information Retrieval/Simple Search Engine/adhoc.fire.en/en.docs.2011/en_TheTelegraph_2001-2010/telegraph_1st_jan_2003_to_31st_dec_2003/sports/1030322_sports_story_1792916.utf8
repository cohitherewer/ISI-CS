The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, March 22, 2003  Nationalistic wins Leger 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Ridden by B. Prakash, Daniel Davids hot-favourite, Nationalistic recorded an easy victory in the 2,800m Calcutta St Leger, the star attraction at the RCTC Friday. The day was otherwise ruled by two surpriase winners from trainer T. N. Jaiswal yard  Secret Blessings and Regal Rocket. 				 										Equally surprising was stewards verdict on Cristopher Alford who was caught going easy on the half-money favourite Assailer (on March 12) in the Long Tom Handicap. Stewards handed a lenient four race-day suspension to Cristopher thus allowing him to conduct the summer circuit as his punishment begins from July 3 and concludes on July 23.

 Sumathipala fears for life
Colombo: Sri Lankas cricket chief Thilanga Sumathipala Monday called for stepped-up security saying he feared for his life after winning a court order protecting him from arrest for alleged links to a criminal.  Shortly after winning the all-clear from a Colombo magistrate, Sumathipala told reporters here that his life was in danger and his opponents were plotting to eliminate him after failing to have him arrested on false charges. The state attorney general told police late last month that there was sufficient evidence to arrest Sumathipala over his alleged links to a convicted criminal. Sumathipala said the drama was aimed at discrediting him during his teams ongoing tour of England. Those who were plotting against me will not stop and I am asking the government to increase my security, Sumathipala said. (AFP)  Copyright

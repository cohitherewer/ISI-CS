The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Saturday, November 22, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	London: John McEnroe is to start coaching British players next week in what he hopes will be a long-term attempt to regenerate the sport in this country. His first session will be in London when he will work with leading British juniors alongside Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) performance director David Felgate, Tim Henmans former coach. 				 																																	To put it bluntly, I want to put some fire in their bellies, the 44-year-old three-time mens Wimbledon champion told BBC Radio. Hopefully this will be the start of an association, not just a superficial thing for a couple of days. 				 																																	He has frequently offered to help British tennis but Felgate, appointed in March, had earlier rejected suggestions McEnroe could help him save the game in Britain. 				 																																	Durban: Out of favour South African allrounder Lance Klusener has surprisingly been included in the national squad to play in a friendly match next month.				 																																	Klusener, who now plays for the Natal provincial side after being dropped from the national squad for a disappointing show in the World Cup early this year, has been selected to play in a Rest of South Africa XI against Western Province match on December 8. Klusener said after his selection on Tuesday he hoped his dispute with the United Cricket Board of South Africa would be resolved soon.				 																																	I am looking forward to playing for South Africa once again, said Klusener.				 																																	Leeds: Leeds United midfielder Jody Morris, facing trial for alleged rape, is ready to face any venom from opposing fans after being cleared to play for the club. 				 																																	Leeds face Bolton in a relegation battle on Saturday when the former Chelsea midfielder might be called up. But caretaker manager Eddie Gray says he can handle any vitriol. 				 																																	Jody knows what could be in store for him, Gray told the Yorkshire Post.He understands that there is every likelihood of a bad reaction towards him from opposition fans. 				 																																	But he can handle what is thrown at him. He has assured me that he can do it and I have no worries about playing him. 				 																																	New Delhi: The Indian challenge came to a disappointing end at the world weightlifting championships on Friday when Karnam Malleswari finished outside the medal bracket.				 																																	Malleswari, who finished 12th with an overall lift of 235kg (105+130) in the 75kg, failed to lift 105kg in snatch. She gave an improved performance in clean and jerk hoisting 130kg. The gold medal went to Shichun Shang of China who created world records in all three categories - snatch, clean and jerk and overall - recording an overall tally of 273kg.				 																																	Barranquilla: Colombia goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba, whose freak mistake cost his team a goal in Wednesdays 1-1 draw with Argentina, is considering quitting the team, he said on Thursday. 				 																																	When Im playing well, Im the first to join the national team, said Cordoba, who succeeded eccentric but error prone Rene Higuita 10 years ago. When Im not, I step aside.				 																																	Sydney: A French daredevil dubbed Spiderman on Friday made a mockery of a security clampdown in Australia on the eve of the rugby World Cup final by scaling the Sydney Harbour Bridge wearing only climbing pants and shorts.  Police said Alain Robert, 41, was arrested at  2.30pm as he made his way down from the eastern side of  the bridge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A one-off affair: Wright
 - With 36 hundreds and 64 fifties, Sachin completes a century in ODIs  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  All eyes will be on Sachin Calcutta: Given the weird travel arrangements from Hyderabad, most Team India members  including coach John Wright  had a Do-Not-Disturb for much of the day at their hotel, on Sunday. In the evening, though, Wright managed time to briefly interact with The Telegraph. Tuesdays final (against Australia) is a one-off affair Sure, we need to learn from the defeats in Mumbai and Bangalore but, really, were looking ahead positively, he remarked. Clearly, the top lesson has to centre around trying to restrict the world champions awe-inspiring line-up. After all, Adam Gilchrist isnt the only one who explodes. While India lost by 77 runs in the Mumbai game, the match in Bangalore saw a 61-run defeat. Those losses cancelled out Indias victory in Gwalior by 37 runs. Of course, much of Wrights confidence stems from Saturdays huge win over New Zealand. It was a crunch game  a semi-final, for all purposes  and we emerged convincing winners More than anything else, (Virender) Sehwags return to form is cause for happiness Now, we have another batsman in form, he pointed out. After scores of 31, 0, 0 and 39, Sehwag cracked a career-best 130 at the Black Caps expense. It would appear he is peaking at quite the right time. Sehwags return among the runs hasnt gone unnoticed in the Australian camp. Coach John Buchanan didnt specifically talk of him, but did say: India certainly put on an improved batting performance Buchanan, in any case, has already gone on record to insist the final isnt going to be influenced by what happened in the league stage. Moreover, he acknowledged: Playing at the Eden is a very different proposition. He hasnt forgotten the March 2001 Test here. Meanwhile, as the teams focus on their second summit showdown in less than eight months, the attention will invariably be on the leading lights. Sachin Tendulkar, for example. Incidentally, one-day crickets most prolific run-getter has completed a century: He now has 36 hundreds and 64 fifties. Oh, is it? Frankly, I hadnt counted But, yes, its nice to get such a different century, Sachin quipped, speaking exclusively. For the record, the champions solitary hundred at the Eden was back in the summer of 1998, in the tri-series final versus Kenya. Being superstitious, Sachin wont talk about Tuesdays face-off. However, if he continues with the form exhibited in Bangalore and Hyderabad, Ricky Ponting and Co. may end up in an unfamiliar role.  Copyright

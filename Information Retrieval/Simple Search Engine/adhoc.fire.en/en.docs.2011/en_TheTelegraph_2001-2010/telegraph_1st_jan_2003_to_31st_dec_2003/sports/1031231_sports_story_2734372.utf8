 Pires fetches Arsenal victory
 Southamptons Fitz Hall in a tussle with Robert Pires of Arsenal in Southampton on Monday. (Reuters) London: Arsenal moved back to within a point of Premier League leaders Manchester United on Monday after a first-half Robert Pires goal earned them victory over Southampton. Arsenal dominated the match and it was no surprise when, in the 36th minute, Pires broke free on the left to receive a perfect pass from France teammate Thierry Henry and slot home left-footed under the diving body of goalkeeper Antti Niemi. Southampton looked more like the away team as they tried to contain the north London side, which enjoyed more than 60 per cent of the possession. Dennis Bergkamp missed a sitter and Henry and Freddie Ljungberg forced spectacular saves from Niemi. It was only some desperate defending that kept the scoreline in check. It was a deserved victory and a job well done, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said, adding his side might have scored more had Niemi not been in such good form. Southampton won the fixture 3-2 last season with a sizzling performance from James Beattie, but on Monday the striker was squeezed out of the game. Arsenal, unbeatentill now are now on 45 points from 19 games, three ahead of third-placed Chelsea and 15 in front of the rest of the Premier League pack. Southampton remain eighth on 26 points. Manager Gordon Strachan said it was the first time his were side playing as though they were frightened of the opposition. (Reuters)  Copyright

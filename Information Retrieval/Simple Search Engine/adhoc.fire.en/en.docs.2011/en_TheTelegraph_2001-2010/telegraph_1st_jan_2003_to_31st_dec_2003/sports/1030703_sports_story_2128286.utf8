Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Only the other day, Australian coach John Buchanan said there wont be any let-up against Bangladesh, even though he acknowledged that, sub-consciously, there was that bit about playing the minnows of Test cricket. However, skipper Steve Waugh set to rest speculation of any slackness in the teams attitude. I dont think motivation will be a problem. Playing for Australia is enough motivation. I dont think there should be any need for motivation when playing for your own country, he said at Udayan on Wednesday afternoon.Whenever we play a new country, its always an exciting experience. Anytime you play a new country it is a new challenge. Playing at new venues will also be thrilling, he explained.That Bangladesh have an abysmal Test record hardly matters for the Australian skipper.In the city on his fourth Udayan-related visit, Steve was also forthcoming on another raging debate  his retirement.Dont know I will keep playing as long as Im enjoying it and as long as I want to try and improve. Cricket is still important to me.

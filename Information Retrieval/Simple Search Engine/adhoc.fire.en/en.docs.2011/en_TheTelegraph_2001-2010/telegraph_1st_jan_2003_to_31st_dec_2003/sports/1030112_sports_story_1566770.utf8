The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 Tight finish appalls Sourav 
																								Auckland, Jan. 11 (PTI): Sourav Ganguly was happy to see his team regain the winning streak but expressed concern over the way in which they won the sixth ODI against New Zealand here tonight.																								We just left it too late. It is not that we have not been in this situation before but we should have won this one easily It was crazy how we let it get down to the last over, Sourav said after India scraped through with a wicket and a ball to spare.																								Sourav refused to blame Mohammed Kaif and said the youngster can have an off-day. I just thought if he had to take a chance, he should have taken Harris on. One needs to give him some time, said Sourav.																								Stephen Fleming said he was disappointed by his bowlers but said it could be because the series had already been decided.																								There is a feeling we are coming to the end of a campaign which we have won. The wides and no balls are an indication that the guys are tired. We had the opportunity to beat them but it slipped through our fingers. 																								Sourav mentioned the last three overs of the New Zealand innings when his bowlers conceded close to 50. We bowled well except the last three overs. It does not normally happen to us. Zaheer usually is fantastic but Bond hit the ball well, observed Sourav.																								The Indian skipper praised the wicket and said he was surprised it did not seam much.																								Indians surprised 																								Like the game in Queenstown, India were docked for slow over-rate in this game also.																								I was surprised about it today. There were people moving up and down in front of the sightscreen, the wicket got a bit loose so umpires took a bit of time about it. I was surprised we were docked an over.																								Fleming was not happy with the way his team bowled or fielded. The boys put down important catches. We know our fielding has to be top-notch to beat sides. We are more disappointed with what we did in the field, said the skipper.

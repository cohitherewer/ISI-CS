The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Raj Singh flays Imran Khan
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT  Raj Singh believes Imrans comments on Sachin were uncalled for Ahmedabad: Raj Singh Dungarpur is livid. The former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president on Wednesday came down heavily on Imran Khan for rating Sachin Tendulkar as not a matchwinner. Imran has no business criticising Sachin. He is Indian crickets icon, said Dungapur. Imran had recently said:  when you compare Sachin Tendulkar to Viv Richards, he is not a match-winner. The greatness of a player is also to perform at the right time. Former India opener and coach Aunshuman Gaekwad was also critical. I think Imran must be joking Just trying to pull Sachins leg, Gaekwad told The Telegraph. Sachin, for his part, had refused to react on Tuesday. But Dungarpur, who was the chairman of selectors when Sachin was picked for the first time in 1989, was fuming. You dont compare Imran to Dennis Lillee. They belong to different generations. Viv is, no doubt, a great player. One shouldnt forget that Donald Bradman had himself said that Sachin resembles his batting. Why did Imran have to choose the day before the start of an important series to pass such irresponsible remarks. Hes not a messiah. When he won the World Cup he talked about his cancer hospital and forgot to mention his players contribution, Dungarpur quipped. Its unfair, unrealistic and unjustified on his part. He has a deep-rooted prejudice. What caused him to say this? Unfortunately, he is all mixed after an unsuccessful stint in politics.  I spoke to Sachin this morning and he only preferred to smile. Sachin is a great batsman because he dominates. So did Viv, but why do you have to compare them, he asked.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara, Hinds in big stand
Port-of-Spain: A classy 80 by Brian Lara guided West Indies to 290 for five on Sunday in the fifth one-day International. Lara, who batted at number three, shared a 178-run partnership with opener Wavell Hinds on a pitch starting to deteriorate. The West Indies skipper barely had time to pad up after winning the toss when opener Chris Gayle (5) was trapped leg before by an inswinging delivery from pace bowler Brett Lee. Having faced some hostile bowling from Lee and Glenn McGrath initially, Lara began to stroke the ball around the Queens Park Oval with ease. Hinds powerful drives provided a pleasing contrast to Laras deft strokes. The opener hit eight boundaries and crashed two mighty sixes into the stands to push up the West Indies run rate. He had scored 79 when an Andy Bichel delivery carried to Adam Gilchrist. After striking 10 boundaries, Lara paid the price for swinging wildly at three successive deliveries as Bichel got the edge to give Gilchrist another catch.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

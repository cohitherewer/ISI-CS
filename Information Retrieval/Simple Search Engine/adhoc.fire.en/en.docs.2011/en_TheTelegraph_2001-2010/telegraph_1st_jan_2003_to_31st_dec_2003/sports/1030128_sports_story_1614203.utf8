The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, January 28, 2003 				 Dalmiya puts coach Wright on notice
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 wright																								Calcutta: Sixteen months after winning the Board presidency on the accountability-ticket, Jagmohan Dalmiya made his first real move on that front: He effectively put coach John Wright on notice.																								Wright, a former New Zealand captain, has been around for 26 months and his contract will be up for renewal after the February 8-March 25 World Cup.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, Dalmiya strongly indicated that Wrights continuance would almost entirely depend on Indias performance in the tournament. This was conveyed during a pre-World Cup brainstorming session in the city on Sunday.																								There was a clear message for the players, too: Stay focussed and qualify for the Super Six.																								Though captain Sourav Ganguly, physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Adrian le Roux were also present, vice-captain Rahul Dravid couldnt make it after a mix-up over flights from Bangalore.																								Dalmiya, one understands, expressed acute dismay at Indias appalling show during the just-ended tour of New Zealand and felt Wright ought to have provided better inputs.																								The Indians, it may be recalled, were whipped both in the Tests and ODIs  0-2 in the former, 2-5 in the latter.																								However, the president didnt dwell on that nightmare alone and asked both the captain and coach to present the plan of action once the squad landed in South Africa on Wednesday.																								[Indias opening Pool A match, against Holland, is on February 12.]																								Dalmiyas message for the players took the form of banning the company of wives and/or children till India qualified for the Super Six.																								The president, in fact, has taken a leaf out of the Pakistan supremo, Lt General Tauqir Zias book: Earlier this month, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced a similar ban.																								Such permission is usually taken for granted As it turns out, though, Dalmiya acted before anybody sought the Boards okay, is how a well-placed source put it.																								Even after qualification, permission is likely to be accorded on a case-by-case basis.																								Significantly, the players have been barred from interacting with and shooting for individual sponsors. Its not clear, however, whether that will be enforced (in full) during the pool-stage of the tournament only. 																								Surprisingly, there will be restrictions on dealing with the Media, too, and its disappointing that the Fourth Estate has being bracketed with personal sponsors. Surely, the odd quote and soundbytes cant be a potential distraction and Media manager Amrit Mathur must be allowed to use discretion.																								Meanwhile, in wanting to lift the players morale, the Board has decided to avail the services of hot-shot sports psychologist Sandy Gordon. Its a nice move, yes, but how effective will limited interaction be?																								The Perth-based Gordon, who regularly works with the Australian team, will have a couple of sessions with Sourav and Co. just before Indias opening game.																								At the moment, though, there are no plans to engage him during the World Cup itself. Much will probably depend on how the players feel, the source added.																								The Indians have, in the past, had sessions with desi motivators, but havent (collectively, at least) been exposed to anybody in Gordons league.																								Incidentally, Dalmiya has authorised Wright to finalise details. Thats very much in keeping with the carrot-and-stick policy often adopted by the president.

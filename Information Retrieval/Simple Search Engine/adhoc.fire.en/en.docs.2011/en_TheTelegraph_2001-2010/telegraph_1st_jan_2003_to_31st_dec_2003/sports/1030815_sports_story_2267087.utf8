 Yasin Merchant joins Advani
New Delhi: National champion Pankaj Advani and Asian Games gold medallist Yasin Merchant qualified for the world snooker championship by virtue of reaching the final of the selection tournament here. Advani had made the cut on Wednesday after beating Manan Chandra 52. The duo will represent India at the world championship in China in October. In the final, which was reduced to one of academic interest as the players had already made it to the worlds, Advani beat Merchant 53 (845, 1029, 6152, 2366, 7013, 3269, 680).  (PTI)  Copyright

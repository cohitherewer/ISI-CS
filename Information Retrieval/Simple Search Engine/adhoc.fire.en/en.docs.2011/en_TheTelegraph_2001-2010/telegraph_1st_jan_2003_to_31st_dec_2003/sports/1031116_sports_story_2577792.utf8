 Zimbabwe on verge of defeat
Bulawayo, Nov. 15 (Reuters): Zimbabwe, chasing 233 for victory, stumbled to 90 for nine before bad light stopped play 12 overs early on the fourth day of the second and final Test against the West Indies on Saturday. Earlier, Ray Price completed a 19-wicket series haul as the tourists collapsed to 128 all out in their second innings, giving Zimbabwe hopes of victory. But the home side subsided to the off-spin of Omari Banks who took three for 35 in 15 overs. In all, 18 wickets fell on a day of poor batting on a deteriorating surface and the West Indies are on the verge of winning the series after just about managing a draw in the first Test in Harare. They resumed their second innings on 13 for one and lost nine wickets for 115 runs to be dismissed 18 overs after lunch. Brian Lara, who made 191 in the first innings, was out for one, bowled by a Heath Streak inswinging yorker. Opener Wavell Hinds topscored with 28 after two hours at the crease before becoming another victim of Price who ended the innings with four for 36 off 21 overs. Mervyn Dillon stroked 27 not out.

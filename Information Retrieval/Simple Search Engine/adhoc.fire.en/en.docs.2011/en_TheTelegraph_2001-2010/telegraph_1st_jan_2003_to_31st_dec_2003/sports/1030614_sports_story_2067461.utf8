 El Guerrouj loses debut 5000m race
Ostrava (Czech Republic): Moroccos triple 1500m world champion Hicham el Guerrouj had to settle for second place in his first-ever attempt at the 5000m at the IAAF Grand Prix Thursday. El Guerrouj, who is aiming at a 1500m-5000m double at the world meet in Paris, led into the home straight where he was passed by Kenyan Stephen Cherono, the Commonwealth Games steeplechase champion. Cherono clocked 12:48.81, the quickest time of the season and the seventh fastest of all time, with El Guerrouj crossing the line 1.43 seconds behind. I didnt expect to beat El Guerrouj, said the 20-year -old Cherono. I ran a great time today at 5000m. Though I also run the steeplechase, I prefer the 1500m. El Guerrouj, who last ran a 5000m as a junior in 1992, admitted that he still has some work to do before he coming to be recognised as a threat in the event. I saw tonight I am not a 5000m runner yet, but I have a good feeling from my first 5000m. Another Kenyan, Cornelius Chirchir, won the 1500m in 3:31.17. Britains Mark Lewis Francis clinched victory in the mens 100m at 10.07, a meet record, to edge out Commonwealth champion Kim Collins of St Kitts and Nevis, with Dwain Chambers third at 10.16. World-record holding pole-vaulter Stacy Dragila was beaten to the top spot, her effort of 4.58m eclipsed by the 4.70m produced by Russias Tatyana Polnova. (AFP)  Copyright

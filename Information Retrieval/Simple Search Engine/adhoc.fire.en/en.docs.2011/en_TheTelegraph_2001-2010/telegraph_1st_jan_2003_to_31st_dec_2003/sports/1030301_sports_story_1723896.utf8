				 																																	Durban: Western Province left-arm seamer Charl Willoughby has been called up to help South Africa prepare for their crunch Group B match against Sri Lanka on Monday.				 																																	Willoughby has been brought in as a net bowler to help Shaun Pollocks batsmen get ready to face left-arm fast bowler Chaminda Vaas. South Africa have to beat Sri Lanka to progress to the Super Six stage after losing to West Indies and New Zealand.				 																																	Durban is traditionally a seamer-friendly pitch and Vaas has already shown he is in superb form, claiming an unprecedented hattrick with the first three balls of the match against Bangladesh. Vaas and Pakistans Wasim Akram are the tournaments joint top wicket takers with 12.				 																																	Willoughby has played once for South Africa in one-day Internationals, taking two for 39 in 10 overs against Pakistan in Sharjah in 1999-2000. 				 																																	Lucknow: Ahead of Indias crunch tie against Pakistan Saturday, bahus from Pakistan are in a dilemma  whom to support.				 																																	If you ask me, I dont want India to play cricket with Pakistan... Its full of tension and regardless of the result it leaves me saddened after every match, says Salma, a Pakistani who got married to a Lucknow-based teacher in 1986. There are thousands of Muslim families in Lucknow who have relatives, including blood relations, in Pakistan. Around 200 such families have their daughter-in-laws from Pakistan. 				 																																	Pervez, a journalist, said that his family members will have a friendly fight with his bhabi, who is from Karachi. 				 																																	Mumbai: Theyre swift. Theyre stealthy.				 																																	They work round-the-clock out of cars, posh apartments and even five-star hotels as Indias excitement over cricket reaches fever pitch. Mobile phones tucked between head and shoulder and fingers flying over computer keyboards, bookmakers in Indias financial heart, Mumbai, track the flood of bets as the national team battles it out in the World Cup in South Africa. Although illegal in India, betting has reached unprecedented levels in Mumbai since the World Cup began two weeks ago.				 																																	Benoni: New Zealands preparations for their last World Cup Group B match against Canada suffered a double setback on Friday with injuries to batsman Lou Vincent and fast bowler Kyle Mills.				 																																	Vincent dislocated his right thumb and Mills pulled a hamstring, both injuries sustained during fielding practice. Vincent was immediately taken to a hand specialist, while Mills, who may not have played against the Canadians on Monday anyway, will undergo ice treatment before his injury is assessed again on Saturday.				 																																	New Zealand need to beat Canada to maintain their hopes of reaching the Super Sixes.				 																																	Johannesburg: Former South Africa coach Bob Woolmer has joined the debate about World Cup day-night matches, saying crickets chiefs should review whether to continue staging them.				 																																	It would seem, judging by the few games that have been played under lights, that the bias is too much weighted towards the side batting first, he wrote in Fridays Business Day newspaper.				 																																	n India vs Pakistan, live from 1.00 pm on DD-1 and 1.30 pm on SET Max n Kenya vs Bangladesh, live from 1.30 pm on Sony

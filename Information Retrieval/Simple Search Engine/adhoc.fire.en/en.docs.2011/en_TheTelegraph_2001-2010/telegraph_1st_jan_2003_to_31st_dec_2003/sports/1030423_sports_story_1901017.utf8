The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kartik fit, hopes for comeback
New Delhi: Indias leading left-arm spinner Murali Kartik has completely recovered from his thumb injury and is hoping to get a recall to the national side soon. I am now completely fit and will soon resume my training and fitness regimen, said Kartik who missed out on a berth in the Indian team for the TVS Cup triangular one-day series in Dhaka because of the crack in his right thumb. Kartik injured his thumb against Jamaica while playing for India A in the Carib Beer domestic competition in the West Indies last month. I hurt my thumb while stopping a hard-hit drive. Initially, I returned to the field after six-seven stitches but a precautionary X-ray later revealed a crack in the thumb, he recalled. It was one more instance of poor luck dogging Kartiks career who claimed 14 wickets from five matches in the Carib Beer series and had good chances of making it to the squad for the TVS Cup. Kartiks talent is not fully reflected from his off-and- on international career during which he has taken nine wickets from four Test matches and four wickets from five one-day Internationals. The pitches for the TVS Cup favoured spinners and Kartik could have joined the fun given the poor batting techniques of rival teams Bangladesh and South Africa against quality spin.  Kartik also lost out on a contract to play league cricket for Hightown Club in Liverpool this season though it was not on account of his thumb injury. They just informed me an Indian A team was to visit England in June and they could not take the risk with me, he said. With veterans like Jawagal Srinath and Anil Kumble on their way out, the Indian bowling attack will centre around young bowlers in the coming seasons. Kartik is keen to mount a fresh challenge for a spinners slot in the coming season, starting with the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka in mid-August. (PTI)  Copyright

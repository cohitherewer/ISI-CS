 200m silver for Rakhi
Bangalore: Uttar Pradeshs Rakesh Kumar created a national record in hammer throw with an effort of 70.16m in the second national athletic circuit meet on Thursday. Kumar erased the 70.13 mark of Ishtiaq Ahamed set here on the same day in 2000. Bobby Aloysius, representing Tamil Nadu, and sprint star P. Anil Kumar won gold medals. In womens 200m, Bengals Rakhi Saha at 24.31 came second after J.J. Shobha of AP (24.17). In womens long jump, Bengals P. Bindu finished third at 5.76, behind Maharashtras Ruta Patkar (6.16) and Shobha (6.12). Bobby managed only 1.80m. This was a disappointing show by her, especially after her silver medal-winning feat of 1.84m at the recent British Super League meet in Manchester. She needed a 1.92m effort to clinch a berth in the world championships in Paris next month. In the mens 100m, Anil Kumar from Services timed 10.40 seconds. His best timing, a national record, was 10.33 seconds. Sanjay Ghosh of SSCB won silver at 10.50. (PTI)  Copyright

 Humpy tops with clean slate
Kozhikode: Having won her maiden National Womens A title with a round to spare on Wednesday, GM Koneru Humpy proved a cut above the rest, remaining unbeaten in the 17-round meet that concluded on Thursday. The 16-year-old proved too much for all her 17 opponents. S. Vijayalakshmi took the runner-up berth with 14.5 points. Following her are WGM Nisha Mohota and Dronavalli Harika on 11 points each.

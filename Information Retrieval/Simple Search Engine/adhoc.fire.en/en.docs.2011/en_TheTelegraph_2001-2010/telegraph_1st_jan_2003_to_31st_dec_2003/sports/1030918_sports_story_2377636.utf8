The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachin likely to hatch new promo
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar, who has been promoting automobiles and tyres, may soon be seen in an ad calling upon the janata to eat/eat more eggs. That has become likely after the Mumbai Cricket Associations (MCAs) two-year sponsorship deal with Venkys and the National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC). The MCA, after all, has committed to make available five players (including Sachin) for TV/print media shoots  besides promo appearances  and the sponsors are bound to take advantage. This commitment, though, is for a total of six days each year. Yes, getting Sachin to espouse the cause of eggs is very much a possibility. However, the ads havent been worked out, a spokesman for Venkys told The Telegraph on Tuesday night, during the MCAs formal announcement of the Rs 90-lakh contract which covers all teams, not just the Ranji side. According to Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, the MCA joint-secretary, Sachins consent was taken before the deal  brokered by Ravi Shastris Showdiff  was inked. He is only too happy that the Mumbai cricketers will get additional money, Prof. Shetty added. Incidentally, the MCA will be following the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias formula, with 60 per cent of the sponsorship money going to the players. Then, much of the remaining 40 per cent will go towards development. Going by the contract, the Mumbai teams will sport the NECC logo this season and Venkys in 2004-2005.  Copyright

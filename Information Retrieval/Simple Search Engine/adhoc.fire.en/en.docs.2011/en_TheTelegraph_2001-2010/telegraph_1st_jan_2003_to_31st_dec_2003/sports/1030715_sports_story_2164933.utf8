The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We will keep using the word respect: Gilchrist
 - Series vs Bangla l Lee says they will not hold back against newcomers  Gilchrist feels it might be difficult to lift their game Darwin: Australias cricket kings may have trouble lifting their game in the two-Test series against minnows Bangladesh, wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist warned here on Monday. The explosive batsman said the Australians would be treating their first-ever series against Bangladesh with respect and would not be motivated by the chance to smash records. The series begins with a Test here on Friday, in what has been described as the biggest mismatch in cricket history. Former Test batsman David Hookes dismissed Bangladesh last week, saying they didnt deserve to be playing in Tests and urged the Australians to try to win the first encounter inside a day. We will keep using the word respect, we will respect the fact that its a Test match, Gilchrist said on Monday. Hopefully, if we win well be able to do it at a level we are happy with and let Bangladesh know where the standard of being one of the best Test teams in the world is at. Gilchrist added: It could be very difficult for us for a few reasons, not so much that where we are playing or who the opposition is, he said. But it is a unique time of year and we have had about nine months, 10 months on the road with a serious amount of cricket. It could be a feeling of difficulty to try and lift ourselves for that. I sense that there could definitely be a threat of that so we have got to make sure that we address it and dont let that slip in. Fast bowler Brett Lee expected the Bangladeshi team  their spirits lifted after Sundays two-wicket tour win over the Northern Territory Chief Ministers XI  to put up a good fight. He was hoping for a quick wicket at the upgraded Marrara Oval in the first Test. I cant see it being too quick though, but I think any sort of wicket is going to be a lot quicker than (in) the West Indies over the last couple of months  its pretty flat over there. He said Australia wouldnt hold back against the Test newcomers. I think that it is not fair on them if we dont go out there and try and put on a really good show, Lee said. I think the best way they should try learning Test cricket is for us to go out there and try and put on a really good performance against them. Thats the way they can actually get better in Test cricket.  (AFP)  Copyright

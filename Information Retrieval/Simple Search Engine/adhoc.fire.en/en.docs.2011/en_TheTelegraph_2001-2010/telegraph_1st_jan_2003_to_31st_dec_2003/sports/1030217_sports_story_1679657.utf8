 Sourav needs to follow Steves example: Imran
The problem with India right now... there is absolutely no self-belief Sourav Ganguly after his dismissal Saturday Johannesburg: Slamming an irresponsible Sourav Ganguly for Indias humiliating loss against Australia in the World Cup, cricket legend Imran Khan said the Indian captain should follow the example of Steve Waugh and learn how to pull the team out of the woods.The captain should be leading by example, especially when the team is low on confidence, the cricketer-turned politician said.But you cannot describe the way Ganguly batted as a captain. It was a very irresponsible shot he played to get out. How can he expect the rest of his team to fight against the Aussies when he plays like that? asked Imran, who led Pakistan to their only World Cup title in 1992 in Australia.Indian batsmen, who struggled against Holland in their first match, could manage only 125 against Australia on Saturday, which the world champions overtook in less than 23 overs losing only one wicket. If you look at the 1999 World Cup, it belonged to Australia captain Steve Waugh. He lifted the spirits of the team whenever his country needed a big score from him... Ganguly needs to follow Waughs example, Imran said on BBC On-line.He said despite being familiar with the South African conditions, Indian players were struggling to put up a fight as their morale was down. The problem with India right now is low morale. There is absolutely no self-belief. They are still suffering from their devastating Test and one-day defeats in New Zealand. Many of the players are familiar with the South African conditions and really there should be no excuses for a batting performance like that, he added. Meanwhile, India also drew criticism from the local media which urged the team to play with resolve in the remaining matches.The Johannesburg-based Sunday Times said in a report that teams like India would have to play with more resolve if they hope to do well in the tournament....The only thing that Ganguly did right all day was to win the toss. He decided to bat on a typically bouncy Centurion pitch, the paper said. Ganguly may be out of form but wild slogging against bowlers of the calibre of (Glenn) McGrath and (Brett) Lee is no way to end a slump. What was required was old-fashioned back-bone and a steely determination to see off the threat of the new ball.Radio and TV commentators were also critical of Indias performance with a radio reporter saying Indians played like palugaas (local term for useless idiots). The Indian performance was pathetic and they are not doing much to excite their supporters, he said in his report for a local radio station. (PTI)  Copyright

 Legal tussle wont affect tie: PCB
Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Wednesday there was no danger of next weeks first Test against Bangladesh being affected by a legal tussle between it and the Karachi cricket authority. The Karachi City Cricket Association (KCCA), which is one of the most influential cricket bodies in the country, filed a petition in the Sindh High Court on Tuesday challenging the Boards decision to award organisational rights of the international matches at Karachi to a provincial body. Whatever happens in the court, it would not affect the organisation of the first Test from August 20 in Karachi as the PCB has the sole and exclusive rights to stage all international matches in Pakistan, said a PCB source.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Becks bans family from Turkey tour
 - Even dad Ted wont travel to watch the Euro qualifier  The decision of Beckham, seen here with wife Victoria, was influenced by the FAs fear that any trouble in Istanbul will lead to England being kicked out of Euro 2004 London: David Beckham has banned his family from attending next months Euro 2004 match between Turkey and England in Istanbul, The Mail on Sunday reported. England captain Beckham has insisted that even his father, Ted, a loyal supporter of his sons exploits, will not be going to the game following an appeal by the Football Association (FA) for fans to stay at home. The outcome of the match will decide the winners of group seven and with that goes one of the coveted automatic qualifying spots for next years finals in Portugal. But both England and Turkey have a persistent hooligan element among their supporter base. FA officials are fearful that any trouble in Istanbul will lead to England being kicked out of Euro 2004, regardless of what happens on the pitch, hence their call to fans not to travel. Beckham, now at Spanish giants Real Madrid after a pre-season transfer from Manchester United, told the tabloid: Dad wont be going to Turkey, none of my family will go. My dad goes to every game possible  if there is a chance he can follow England away, he will be there. Of course he would have been in Turkey if it was a normal situation but the fans have been warned not to go. England were fined 70,000 and warned about their future conduct by European soccer governing body Uefa after racist chants were directed at Turkey supporters during Englands 2-0 win at Sunderlands Stadium of Light in April. But in July the Turkish FA were also fined by Uefa after Turkey fans threw missiles at Macedonia players. Football relations between England and Turkey had soured long before the Stadium of Light incident. Back in April 2000, two Leeds United supporters were stabbed to death in Istanbul ahead of a European tie against Galatasaray and one month later a group of Arsenal fans were involved in running battles with followers of the same club at the Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen. Shortly before England play in Istanbul there is another high-profile Anglo-Turkish match when London side Chelsea host Besiktas in the Champions League on October 1.  Couple on celluloid Beckham and British actor Jude Law have struck a deal to make a series of short films which will feature the England captains celebrity wife Posh Spice as well. Beckham and Jude, who has just finished production on sci-fi flick World of Tomorrow, held talks about the movies in a secret two-hour meeting after Englands win over Liechtenstein on Wednesday. They met at the Marriott Hotel in Worsley where the England team was staying after the European championship, The News of the World reported on Sunday. According to the report, Jude arrived separately from Beckham and wife Victoria, who was seen flanked by her new manager Simon Fuller. But it was Jude, 30 and Beckham, 28, who spent their time locked away in a room working out the deal that would see the trio on celluloid for the first time. Quoting a source close to the England captain, the report said Jude and Beckham share a mutual fan club but it was Becks who took the initiative for the meeting. Jude and Beckham talked about football too and joked about Spurs, whom Jude supports, not having a good start to the season.  (Agencies)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nistelrooy recalled to Dutch squad
Hague: Holland coach Dick Advocaat has recalled striker Ruud van Nistelrooy for the first of two Euro 2004 qualifying playoffs against Scotland in Glasgow on Saturday. Van Nistelrooy is unlikely to start against Berti Vogts side at Hampden Park as Advocaat still believes that the Manchester United star does not pair well with Barcelonas Patrick Kluivert. Van Nistelrooys inclusion had already been hanging by a thread after a display of petulance when he was substituted during Septembers defeat in the Czech Republic. After that episode, Advocaat left him out of the squad for the final match in qualifying against Belarus. However it appears that Advocaat is well aware of Nistelrooys value, and the United striker is likely to come off the bench at some point in the first leg against the Scots. Advocaat has few injury problems and is especially spoiled for choice up front where former Celtic striker Pierre van Hooijdonk  who has started well in his new career at Turkish club Fenerbahce  could feature alongside Bayern Munichs Roy Makaay, or Kluivert. In midfield Advocaat has been forced to recall AC Milans Clarence Seedorf due to an injury to Mark van Bommel. Juventus Edgar Davids also returns following a one-game suspension.  (AFP)  Copyright

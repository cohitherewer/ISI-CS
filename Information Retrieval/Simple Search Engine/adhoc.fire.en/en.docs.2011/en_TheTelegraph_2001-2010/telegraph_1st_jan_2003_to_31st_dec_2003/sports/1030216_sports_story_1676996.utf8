The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cricket for England, finally

(Reuters) East London: Englands much-delayed entrance into the World Cup is due to take place when they face Holland at Buffalo Park Sunday. Nasser Hussains men should have started the tournament against Zimbabwe in Harare on Thursday but decided to boycott the fixture on security grounds. Opener Nick Knight, one of the teams most consistent one-day performers, think the fear is genuine. You receive a letter like that (supposedly death threat) and its a serious issue. It hit everyone very hard, Knight said. Adding to Englands off-field problems is the injury to Craig White which is set to sideline the allrounder from the match. Veteran Alec Stewart has been continuing to receive ice-treatment for a persistent hand condition but is expected to be fit. And, in some good news for England, fast bowler Stephen Harmison is over the ankle problems that affected him in Australia while a quick dash back to Durham to see his new born daughter appears to have helped heal his homesickness. Holland, captained by former Somerset paceman Roland Lefebvre bowled India out for just 204 with Tim de Leede taking four for 35. And considering Hollands fielding, England will do well not to underestimate the Dutch.

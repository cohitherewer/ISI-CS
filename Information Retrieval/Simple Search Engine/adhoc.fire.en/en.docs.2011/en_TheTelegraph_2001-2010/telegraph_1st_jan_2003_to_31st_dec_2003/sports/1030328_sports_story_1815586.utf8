The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ad-hoc extension likely for John Wright
 - If coach not available, India may  go to Dhaka without one BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI WRIGHT: Back home  to attend ailing father  Calcutta: Assuming that  the April 11-20 tri-series is held on schedule, in Bangladesh,  its quite likely that the contracts of John Wright, Andrew  Leipus and Adrian le Roux will be extended on an ad-hoc  basis. The contracts of all three key  members of Team Indias support staff, it may be recalled,  ended with the World Cup. Look, the decision to extend/not  extend their contracts wont be decided by me only  it  will have to be discussed at the proper forum and, in any  case, the other office-bearers may also have an opinion,  Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan  Dalmiya told The Telegraph Thursday. He added: Its possible that  as an interim arrangement, all three contracts could be  extended till April 20. If it comes to that, the initiative  can be taken by me after consulting other office-bearers. The BCCI, of course, doesnt have  to rush into making a long-term commitment as Team India  will have a break from engagements till mid-August (Asia  Cup, Sri Lanka). While physio Leipus (who has been  around from October 1999) and physical trainer Le Roux (with  the team for a year) shouldnt find it inconvenient to make  themselves available at short notice, theres a slight question  mark over coach Wright, who has been around from November  2000. Wrights father, one understands,  is very ill and Indian crickets first coach from overseas  has gone back to New Zealand to be with his ailing father.  At the moment, then, its not clear whether he can return  for the ill-timed tri-series. Lets wait and see... If Wright  cant make it, then somebody else maybe given that short-term  assignment, Dalmiya pointed out. In fact, it wont surprise  if Team India departs without a coach  after all, its  a one-day tournament and a short-term appointment could  trigger unnecessary speculation, putting both the appointee  and the BCCI under pressure. If it comes to that, the manager  may have a bigger role to play. Incidentally, there has been talk  about some top players making themselves unavailable, but  the BCCI president informed nobody has formally done so  as yet. The squad will be picked on April 1-2. Sahara bounty Meanwhile, though Team India lost  the World Cup final (to Australia), Sahara India Pariwar  will still be presenting dupleix apartments at Amby Valley.  The handing-over function is slated for April 1. Copyright

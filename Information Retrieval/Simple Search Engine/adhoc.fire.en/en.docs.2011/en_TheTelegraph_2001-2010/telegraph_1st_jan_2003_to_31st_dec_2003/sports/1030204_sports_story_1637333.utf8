The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes praise for Bopanna
  Leander: Happy memories at NSCI New Delhi: Rohan Bopannas chances of playing singles in the Davis Cup tie against Japan received a big boost after the youngster received rave reviews from five-time Grand Slam doubles champion Leander Paes. He is a much improved player. He has come up leaps and bounds since I saw him last in the tie against Australia last year, senior pro said as the squad geared up for the Asia-Oceania group I opening round tie from Friday to Sunday. Bopanna made his Cup debut in September, going down to Scott Draper in straight sets in a dead rubber of the World Group play-off tie in Adelaide. But since then, Bopanna has reached the final of the Asian championship in Tashkent where he lost to Goichi Motomura  one of his likely opponents over the weekend. The 22-year old then followed it up with the scalp of Korean Lee Hyung-taik, who recently captured the Auckland ATP crown, defeating Spaniard hotshot Jun Carlos Ferrero in the final. It was at the NSCI that Paes scripted one of his several big wins  against big-serving Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia in 1995. These grasscourts (at the NSCI) will always provide me with happy memories, Paes said.  (PTI)  Copyright

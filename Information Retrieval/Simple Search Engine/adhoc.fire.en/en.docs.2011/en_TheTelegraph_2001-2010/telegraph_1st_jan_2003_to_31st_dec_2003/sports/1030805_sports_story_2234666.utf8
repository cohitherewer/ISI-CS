The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We paid for missing chances: Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal coach coach Subhas Bhowmick took Mondays loss in the Tata Federation Cup quarters to Vasco somewhat philosophically. Vascos Derrick Pereira, on the other hand, said it was the Lords will and a miracle. It happens to all teams talk of the ground condition certainly did not affect the players, said Bhowmick. But I feel not having a good session of practice after the ASEAN championship has created this problem. He ruled out complacency or unattached attitude of any player for this debacle. We did not manage to give to them all. We missed too many chances in the second half, and paid for it, said Bhowmick. Pereira, though, does not want to put this as a revenge for their 0-4 loss last season. I still say East Bengal are the best team, but we worked hard and hard work does pay. Vasco had qualified for the last eight the hard way, knocking out Tollygunge Agragami 8-7 in sudden death.  Copyright

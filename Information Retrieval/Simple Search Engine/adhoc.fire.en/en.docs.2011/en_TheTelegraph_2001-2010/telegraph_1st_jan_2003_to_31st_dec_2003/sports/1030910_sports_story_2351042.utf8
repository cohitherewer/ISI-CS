 The AIFF has sent to the IFA a list of probables  from Bengal for Afro-Asian Games football in October. Strangely  enough, Bhaichung Bhutia and Rennedy Singhs names are missing.  AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said Bhaichung is currently  a Malaysian-association registered player and clearance  would have to be sought from that association. Rennedys  omission appears to be a mistake and he will be called to  the camp starting October 2 in Bangalore.				 																																																	THE BENGAL PROBABLES 				 																																																	Sangram Mukherjee, Sandip Nandy, Mahesh Gawli, M. Suresh, Dipak Mondal, Debjit Ghosh, Surkumar Singh, S. Malsawmtluanga, Alvito DCunha, Bijen Singh (East Bengal); Dipendu Biswas, Satish Bharti (Mohammedan Sporting); Ashim Biswas (Mohun Bagan). Dattatreya Mukherjee and Pronab Roy passed  the Level II coaching course conducted by the BCCI under  former England paceman Frank Tyson. Five from Bengal appeared  for the examination.				 																																																	SOCCER: Super Division  EB vs Ever-Ready (EB); Md. Sp. vs Md. AC (Salt Lake) from 3 pm. Relegation leg  CPT vs WB Police (Howrah); Bhratri Sangha vs Railway FC (Rabindra Sarobar) from 3.15 pm. 				 																																																	TENNIS: Junior meet at BTA Complex.

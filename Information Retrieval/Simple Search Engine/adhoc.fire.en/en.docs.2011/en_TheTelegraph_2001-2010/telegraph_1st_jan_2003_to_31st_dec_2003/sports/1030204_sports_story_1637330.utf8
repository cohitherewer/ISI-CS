 Pawar puts Assam on top
 Guwahati: A career-best 175 by Kiran Pawar propelled Assam to a commanding position with a huge 258-run first innings lead on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy match against Uttar Pradesh here on Monday. Replying to Uttar Pradeshs first innings 211, the hosts declared after amassing 469 for nine, thanks to Powars knock and a quickfire, unbeaten 80 by Manoj Joglekar. Resuming at 167 for one, left handed opener Subhrajit Saikia could not last long and was out for 77 to be the first of the six victims of UP skipper Gyanendra Pandey who capitalised on the turning track. Pawar, however, continued his good form and scored fifth century of his career and second in this Ranji season. SUMMARISED SCORES n In Ahmedabad: Orissa 589/5 decl.

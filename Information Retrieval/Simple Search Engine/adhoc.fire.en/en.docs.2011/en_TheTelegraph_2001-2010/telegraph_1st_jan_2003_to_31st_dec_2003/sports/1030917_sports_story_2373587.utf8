 Whatmore warning for wards
Rawalpindi: Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore has warned some of his players to toughen up or lose their places in the team. If I do find one or two players who are not prepared to toughen up for international matches then they wont have a very long career at all, Whatmore said following Bangladeshs defeat in the third ODI against Pakistan in Lahore on Monday. Whatmore is still searching for his first win in Tests or ODIs since taking charge of Bangladesh last June. Bangladesh lost the three-Test series in Pakistan 0-3 and are 0-3 down in the five-match ODI series. Bangladesh, who earned Test status in 2000, have yet to win a Test and have gone without a win in one-dayers since they beat Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup in England. With two matches to play on their tour of Pakistan, Whatmore said he was looking for improvement. I had some hopes in this one-day series. But I have revised my goals and objectives after the first game. But generally we are moving in the right direction, he said. Bangladesh had to chase a revised target of 244 in 44 overs in the third ODI. It is not easy having six overs cut and having to chase a revised target of six runs per over from five. If we had been chasing the same score, then it might have been easier and a more competitive match, captain Khaled Mahmud said. Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram had encouraging words for Bangladesh, however, saying the sides improvement showed in their fielding and attitude.  (PTI)  Copyright

				 																																																	 Biswanath Dutt, the former CAB and BCCI president, has turned down a request from the present chief, Jagmohan Dalmiya, to not sever ties with the CAB. Dutt is the chairman of the CABs trustee board. I have been with the CAB for the past 25 years. I dont think I have anything more to give to the association, Dutt said Friday.				 																																																	He added that Dalmiya did make a personal request to continue. However, my personal opinion is that no one should hold a post forever. Thats why I have taken the decision and I will stand by it, Dutt emphasised.

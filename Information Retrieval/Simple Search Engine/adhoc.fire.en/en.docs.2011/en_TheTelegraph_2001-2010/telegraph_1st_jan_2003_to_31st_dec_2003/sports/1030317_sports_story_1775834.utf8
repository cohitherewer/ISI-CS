				 																																	Durban: World Cup organising chief Ali Bacher on Sunday threw his weight behind surprise semi-finalists Kenya saying he did not exclude the giant killers from race of contenders for the final. Kenya has beaten no less than three regular Test nations in this World Cup  not to mention their spirited performance against Australia last night.				 																																	Its a great achievement, not just for Kenyan cricket, but for African cricket to have them in the semi-final especially when you consider that indigenous African players make up more than three quarters of the team. It speaks a lot about Africas potential in cricket, Bacher said. I would not entirely exclude Kenya from the final. 				 																																	Johannesburg: Shaun Pollock and his brother Gavin were counting the cost of South Africas humiliating World Cup exit on Sunday. Shaun was coming to terms with being sacked as captain, while businessman Gavin has been left with thousands of dollars worth of unwanted Proteas souvenirs and clothing in the wake of the doomed campaign.				 																																	Its tough but what can you do? said Gavin who runs a Durban sports shop where he had hoped to make a financial killing by seeing the South Africans storm through the tournament. As it turned out, his brothers team, which began the tournament as co-favourites never made it out of the first round. Gavin says he has lost 100,000 rand.				 																																	Johannesburg: New Zealand coach Denis Aberhart has criticised the World Cup format saying it is not necessarily designed to produce the best team in the world.				 																																	I dont think this format will necessarily find the best team in the world, he said after his sides exit from the Super Six stage Saturday. Kenya and Zimbabwe got through (to the Super Sixes) because they both received points from forfeited games and were favoured by the lack of reserve days.				 																																	And Im not sure whether the system for carrying through points from the first round is a good idea. I tend to think everyone should start the second round afresh.				 																																	Hosts South Africa, Pakistan, West Indies and England failed to reach the second round. 				 																																	n Australia vs Kenya, highlights from 8.00 am on Max; Repeat from 9.30 am on DD-1 n World Cup highlights from 8.00 am on DD-2 n India vs New Zealand, repeat from 7.00 pm on Max n Taking Guard, semi-final preview, live from 9.00 pm on ESPN

		 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 Umpire allows Nehra just a single
																								Auckland, Jan. 11 (PTI): Even as India celebrated their narrow one-wicket victory against New Zealand , confusion abounded about the runs produced by Ashish Nehras winning shot on the penultimate ball of the match.With India needing one run from the last two balls to overhaul New Zealands 199 for nine, Nehra pulled Andre Adams over the crowded in-field for a boundary. He and partner Jawagal Srinath also ran a single before returning to the pavilion to join in the celebrations.																								The television company covering the match live put Indias total at 203 for nine from 48.5 overs and Nehras individual score to four runs from one ball. 																								But as it turned out later, India were credited with only a single and their final score was 200 for nine. Officials here explained that the two batsmen had completed their single before the ball reached the boundary. And as the target was overtaken with that single, the match was deemed to have finished at that point. Whether the ball travelled to the boundary after that was immaterial, they said.																								They also pointed out that the umpire had not signalled a boundary for that shot.

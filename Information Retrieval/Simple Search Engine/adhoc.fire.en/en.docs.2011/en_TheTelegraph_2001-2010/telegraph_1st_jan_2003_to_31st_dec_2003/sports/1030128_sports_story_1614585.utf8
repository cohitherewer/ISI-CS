		 Tuesday, January 28, 2003 				 Injured Samuels ruled out
				 	 SAMUELS 																								St Johns: West Indies batsman Marlon Samuels has been forced out of the World Cup in southern Africa with a knee injury, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said on Sunday. All-rounder Ryan Hinds is to replace Samuels in the 15-man squad after a scan on Samuels left knee showed it would probably not stand up to the rigours of the tournament, the WICB said .																								 We are disappointed at this turn of events and realise how much more disappointed Marlon himself must be, selection committee chairman Viv Richards said. But, we believe that our decision to replace him for the World Cup is best both for the team at this time and Marlons career.																								Samuels disappointment comes as a result of a medical report submitted to the WICB by Dr Akshai Mansingh, following a scan performed in Kingston on Thursday. The report further recommended that Samuels undergo additional corrective surgery on his knee that was operated on in Sharjah in February of last year and which may involve a bone grafting procedure. 																								Bevan cleared																								Meanwhile, Australia batsman Michael Bevan has been cleared to play in next months World Cup after his injured groin was not as bad as initially feared, adds another report from Sydney.																								The left-hander may still miss the one, or possibly two matches of the tournament but Australias selectors said they were prepared to take a gamble on him. (Agencies)

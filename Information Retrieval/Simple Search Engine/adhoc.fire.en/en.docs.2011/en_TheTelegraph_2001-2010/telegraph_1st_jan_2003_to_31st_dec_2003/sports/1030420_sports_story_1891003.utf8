				 																																	Amelia Island: The WTA tour honoured Martina Navratilova for completing a career Super Slam.				 																																	Navratilova is the first player in the modern era to win the singles, doubles and mixed doubles at all four Grand Slams during her career.				 																																	The 46-year-old Navratilova, who won her first Grand Slam title nearly 30 years ago, completed the Super Slam by winning the Australian Open mixed doubles title with Leander Paes in january.				 																																	This is a stunning achievement and one that is not likely ever to be repeated, WTA Tour CEO Larry Scott said at the Bausch amp; Lomb championships on Thursday.				 																																	When I first started I wanted to be the youngest to win something, but that didnt happen, Navratilova said. I then figured if I hung around long enough, I could be the oldest.				 																																	Navratilova won 167 singles titles and 169 doubles titles in a career that continues into a fourth decade. 				 																																	London: Youri Djorkaeff, a World Cup and European Championship winner with France, says he will retire from the game if his English Premier League club Bolton Wanderers are relegated.				 																																	The 35-year-old forward, formerly with Inter Milan and Kaiserslautern, told The Guardian on Saturday that joining Bolton had injected new life into his career.				 																																	But he added: If we go down, then I will stop playing because Im sure that next season will be very different in the first division. I have one year left on my contract at Bolton so if we stay up I will definitely play next year if the manager wants me. I dont know if I would want to be involved in playing for promotion next season but staying up this year would mean as much to me as winning the World Cup (1998) and European Championship (2000) with France because I never knew how hard it would be to help a club stay in the Premiership.				 																																	Suva: Fijis players have been promised a cash bonus of $600,000 if they reach the semi-finals at this years World Cup. The Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) announced on Saturday that the teams main sponsor had pledged to split the bonus between the players and management if the Pacific islanders made the last four.				 																																	Fiji qualified for the World Cup as Oceania group winners and have been drawn in Pool B alongside France, Scotland and Japan, and also the winners of the play-off between United States and Spain. They need to finish at least second in the group if they are to qualify for the tournaments quarter finals for the second time.				 																																	Fiji advanced to the quarter finals at the inaugural World Cup in 1987. This years World Cup runs from October 10 to November 22. 				 																																	Havana: Cuba intends to bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games with Havana as host city, the president of the Cuba Olympic Committee Jose Ramon Fernandez said on Friday.				 																																	Fernandez pleaded to have his countrys bid based on sporting criteria and not economic considerations when a decision is made on the hosts by the International Olympic Committee in Singapore in July 2005.				 																																	Other candidates for the games are Leipzig, New York, Madrid, Moscow, Rome, Paris, Toronto and perhaps London. It has yet to be decided whether or not Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo will represent Brazils bid.				 																																	The deadline for submissions is July 15.				 																																	Sofia: The Bulgarian Football Union on Friday suspended four referees until the end of the season for poor officiating.				 																																	BFUs referees commission decided to stop Georgi Narlev, Georgi Videlov, Yordan Ivanov and Valeri Petrovski from officiating until the end of the season for poor officiating, spokesman Asparuh Yassenov said.

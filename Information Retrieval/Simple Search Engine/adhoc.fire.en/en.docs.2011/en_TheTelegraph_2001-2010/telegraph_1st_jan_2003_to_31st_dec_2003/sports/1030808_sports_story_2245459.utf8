The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand halts Bologan run
Dortmund: World Cup champion Viswanthan Anand mesmerised his fans with his third brilliant victory on the trot, accounting for tournament leader Viktor Bologan of Moldova in the seventh round of the Sparkassen chess meet here. This is a remarkable recovery for the Indian giant who has had a fabulous year prior to this event. After two very uncharacteristic losses in Round II and III, Anand is back with a big bang and is now in joint second position with Braingames champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. With this victory Anand also settled scores with Bologan who had earlier beaten him in the second round game here. However, despite a very demoralising loss, Bologan continued to lead the tables with a full point margin, tallying five out of a possible seven. Anand and Kramnik have an identical score of four points while GM Arkadi Naitisch of Germany is joint third along with GM Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan on 2.5 points apiece. Anand was a picture of confidence as he settled behind white pieces against Bologan. The Indian naturally had a point or two to prove after his disastrous start and for the third time in succession his form was brilliant and his preparation came in handy. It was one of the main variations of the Caro Kann where Bologan fell prey to an ingenious novelty on the 14th move. It was a home prepared novelty, it was prepared for world champion Ruslan Ponomariov last year, but I could play it only now, said Anand after the game. The middle game appeared wild in nature right from the beginning as Anand launched an offence against the king with his finely crafted queen manoeuvres and took the Moldovan aback with a fantastic rook sacrifice on the 26th move. Bologan was forced to part with his queen as Anands missile like pieces swung into action soon after and the Indian had two pawns and his vibrant lady against two meek rooks after the dust subsided. The rest was childs play for Anand and he wrapped the issue in just 36 moves. Kramnik drew with Naiditsch in just 23 moves, almost signalling that Bologan was difficult to catch. The German had nothing to worry about with his white pieces and drew in just 27 moves. (PTI)  Copyright

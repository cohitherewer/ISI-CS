The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav: I still dont believe it 
 - Tainted cricketer says hes disappointed with false allegation as Team India captain reserves judgement  Chennai: Team India captain Sourav Ganguly  on Friday stood by Abhijit Kale, who is at the centre of  an alleged bribery scandal, saying it was important to establish  the truth before passing a judgement.  Expressing shock over the allegation that Kale had  offered money for a place in the senior squad, Sourav said  it was difficult for him to believe the players involvement  since he had known him for a long time. [Meanwhile in Calcutta, Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya described Souravs comments as personal.] It is difficult for me to make a statement on that (bribery allegation) at this time. I am not too sure that a person like Kale could do such a thing, Sourav told a press conference before the Indian teams departure for Australia. I have known Kale for a long time. I will have to wait and see. I still do not believe in it, Sourav said. Anything could come out in the media, be it television or newspapers. Anybody could pass a statement on somebody. How far it is true that is important. I do not think a mere allegation should have a problem (for Kale) unless it is an established fact, the Indian skipper added.  The 30-year-old Kale, a prolific scorer in the domestic  circuit, has played one one-day International against Bangladesh  this year.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB-MB clash only in final
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Defending champions Mohun Bagan and East Bengal will not meet each other until the final of the Federation Cup to be played in the city from July 26 to August 8.

The tournament, last held in the city in 1997 and not held last year, will follow the 16-team knockout format introduced in 2001. All matches will be played at Salt Lake Stadium.

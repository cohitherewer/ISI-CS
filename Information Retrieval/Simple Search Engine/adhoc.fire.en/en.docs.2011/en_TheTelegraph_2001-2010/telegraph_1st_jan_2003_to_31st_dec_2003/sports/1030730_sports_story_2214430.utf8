The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lady Luck may smile on punters 
 BY STAR RACER Stephens Calcutta: Going by the law of averages lady luck may favour the RCTC punters on Wednesday, after weeks of pounding at the hands of lesser-fancied winners. To add to their comfort, some of trainer Vijay Singhs favourites may also strike. More importantly, they may put a check to the rampant malpractice of some stables, who prefer to go easy with their fancied runners.For instance, Vijays Archery in the Treasure Land Handicap, Modesto in the Vasto Handicap and Inside Story in the afternoons feature event, the Pa Bear Cup, are expected to push hard and make for some gripping competition, unless the opposition decides to let them have an easy passage in their respective events.However, it is Way To The Stars who gets the first call in the main event over 1,400m. The John Stephens-trainee is the only one in the field of four who has had a run advantage and is also looking much improved. Robert Gowli partners the six-year-old by Dont Forget Me out of Sterling Quest.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

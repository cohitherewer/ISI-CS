 Streak suffers back injury
Worcester: Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak suffered a back injury during their tour match against Worcestershire at New Road here on Friday with less than two weeks before the first Test against England. Streak left the field having bowled just two overs in what represents a setback for the southern African sides build-up to the Lords Test starting on May 22. After the first days play, Zimbabwe were 69 for three after 30 overs in reply to the 262 all out in 60.5 overs by Worcestershire. Stuart Carlisle on 29 and B. Rodgers on one were at the crease. Earlier, Vikram Solanki scored 74 for the hosts, while Douglas Hondo scalped three Worcestershire wickets. Andy Blignaut and Raymond Price took two each. The 29-year-old is unlikely to feature in the rest of this four-day fixture meaning he will only have one fixture, against Sussex next week, to warm up for Lords. Coach Geoff Marsh said: Hes got a bit of a back problem which he got in his first over. I dont think hes likely to play much of a part in the rest of the game which is a big disappointment for us. Hes done quite a bit of bowling before we came to England, so he doesnt really need the practice and well be monitoring him over the next few days  he might wake up in the morning and everythings fine.

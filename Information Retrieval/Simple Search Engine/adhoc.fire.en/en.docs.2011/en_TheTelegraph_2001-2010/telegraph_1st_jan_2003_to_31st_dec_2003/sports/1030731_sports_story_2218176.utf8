The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jackson not keen on meets abroad
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengal players limber up at the club ground on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick regards him as one of the reasons behind his teams success in the recently concluded ASEAN Club Championship. But fitness trainer Kevin Jackson doesnt agree with the coach on the issue of the East Bengal players going out to play for foreign clubs mid-season. While Bhowmick feels it is really a good idea for the players like Bhaichung Bhutia, Alvito DCunha or Surkumar Singh to have a stint abroad, Jackson feels it will hamper their progress on the fitness front. They are going through a programme which I have chalked out. Now if they get away from it, itll be tough for me to get them back into shape, Jackson told The Telegraph. As it is they are playing too many games which does no good to their fitness. And now, things are made more difficult for me, he said. Jackson said he would inform the club officials soon about his misgivings. He also added that the players should concentrate on delivering for East Bengal alone once they have signed for the club. The South African also felt that there hasnt been any dramatic improvement in the players fitness. I have worked with them for only two weeks. You cannot expect everything to change in such a short span of time. He, however, gave his wards full credit for the show in Jakarta. It is entirely the success of the boys. They did it on the field and I shouldnt be taking the credit. Basically, my job in Jakarta was to keep the boys in a proper frame of mind. Nothing new could be done on the physical front, he said. The trainer will be going back home on leave on Saturday. Ill be back. But I havent yet finalised the date of my return, he said.  Copyright

				 																																	Johannesburg: South African cricket board president Percy Sonn Friday issued an unconditional apology for his behaviour during the World Cup match between India and Holland in Paarl on Wednesday. Sonn got drunk and used offensive language during the match.				 																																	I realise that my conduct at Boland Park on Wednesday fell short of standards which people find acceptable for a person in my position and, if I offended anyone with my behaviour, I sincerely apologise, the UCBSA chief said in a statement. I apologise unconditionally, especially to all South Africans and to the world cricketing fraternity.				 																																	I know that as president of the United Cricket Board of South Africa I hold a high position of responsibility and authority and it is a position that took many years of hard work and commitment to reach. I know that this position carries certain levels of acceptable conduct and that my behaviour is subject to public scrutiny. As such, I understand that my conduct should always be above reproach and that I should set an example for all in South African cricket.				 																																	Johannesburg: In an effort to protect his suspect knees, New Zealands Chris Cairns had waited around 12 months to bowl again. But after his one and only over was hit to all parts of the Port Elizabeth for 21 runs by the West Indies Thursday, the 32-year-old could have been forgiven if he demanded another years break before he turned his arm again.				 																																	The skipper gave me the ball and told me to bowl to keep the West Indies tied down, but it was a disaster, he admitted.				 																																	After a long lay-off from the international scene, Cairns returned to the Black Caps squad for the final three one-dayers against India in January but only as a batsman.				 																																	It is always easier to bat than bowl when you have been away so I will just have to work harder. There is a lot of work to do but I know I will get better.				 																																	n Australia vs India, live from 1.30 pm on SET Max amp; 1.10 on DD-1 n Canada vs Kenya, live from 5.30 pm on Sony n Sri Lanka vs Bangladesh, highlights from 10.00 am on SET Max

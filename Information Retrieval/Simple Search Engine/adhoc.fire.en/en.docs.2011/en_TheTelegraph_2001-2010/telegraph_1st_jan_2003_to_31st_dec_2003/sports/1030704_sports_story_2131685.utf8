 Stig Tofting freed from prison
Copenhagen: Former Denmark international Stig Tofting has been freed from prison, where he was serving time for assault, and is about to go to Beijing concerning a possible move to a Chinese club, Danish media reported on Thursday. The 33-year-old Tofting, formerly of Bolton Wanderers, was sentenced to four months in prison for serious assault at a Copenhagen restaurant but was freed on Wednesday, 16 days before the full term. Tofting retired from international football after Denmark were knocked out by England in the second round of the 2002 World Cup finals.  (AFP)  Copyright

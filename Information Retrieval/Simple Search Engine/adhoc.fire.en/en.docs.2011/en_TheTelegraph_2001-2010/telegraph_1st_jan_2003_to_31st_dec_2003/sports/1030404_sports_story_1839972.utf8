The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Time for Bopanna to come of age
 BY ATREYO MUKHOPADHYAY Rohan Bopanna cools down during a break in practice at the South Club Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: The court is nice, green and soft. The heat might just be enough to drive the Kiwis crazy and it is difficult to find many betting on the visitors in the Davis Cup Asia-Oceania group I second round tie against India to be played over the weekend.Leander Paes looks hungry once more, and going by his Davis Cup deeds and New Zealands recent track record, there seems a bias in the debate on who are the favourites.Not everybody in the Indian camp can take it easy. For Rohan Bopanna, its a challenge to establish himself as Indias second singles player. The spotlight wont be on the 22-year-old from Coorg when he takes on New Zealand No. 2 Alistair Hunt Friday. But Bopanna will be under scrutiny nonetheless, of several probing eyes, looking desperately for a player who could reduce the pressure on Paes.Its not going to be any other match. Theres going to be a lot more at stake. Its a question of cementing myself in the team as a leading singles player after all, said Bopanna, the highest ranked Indian singles player at 348. In the increasingly busy calendar of a professional tennis player, all matches are equally important. But this is going to be a significant match. For me, its importance is paramount, because a win here will enhance my credentials as a reliable singles hand, Bopanna told The Telegraph Thursday.Even Paes spoke about the importance of unearthing another capable singles player. I virtually have to shoulder the responsibility in three matches and that takes its toll. Its like having your job on the line in every match. But Bopanna has been hitting the ball well, Paes observed. Bopanna is drawing inspiration from his decisive win over Jun Kato in the previous World Group qualifier against Japan in Delhi in February. Even though the win came against a player way behind in rankings, the confidence factor remains important.Im a lot more confident now. Representing your country is a big honour and to be able to cap it with a win is a great moment. Conditions like weather and surface are strongly in our favour and I should be able to make most of it.Winning a couple of ITF Futures titles, reaching the final at the Asian individual championship and beating the then world No. 86 at the Bangkok Challenger last year are the highpoints of Bopannas career so far. A win Friday will surely be added to that list.Bopannas big, booming first service should come in handy at South Club and the player acknowledges that grass suits him fine. Favourite surface, playing at home against none-too-formidable rivals, things dont usually get so tailor-made in the big, bad world of professional tennis.Time for Bopanna to make the most of it.INDIA-NZ HEAD-TO-HEADIndia have met New Zealand four times in Davis Cup.

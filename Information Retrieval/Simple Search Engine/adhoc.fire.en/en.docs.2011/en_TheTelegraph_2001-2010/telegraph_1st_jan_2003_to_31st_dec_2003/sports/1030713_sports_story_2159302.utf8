The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ever-Ready lose
 - super division l Railway FC multiply Duttas woes  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Amal Duttas team lost 0-1 to Railway FC on Saturday  Calcutta, July 12: Amal Duttas team is in a fix. So is his reputation. At the East Bengal ground Saturday, Ever-Ready failed to get around Railway FCs youthful enthusiasm and stamina and collapsed to a 0-1 defeat, despite some late resurgence. That leaves Ever-Ready in a pretty unenviable position, with one defeat a draw and a single win off three matches they have played so far. And it pushes RFC to their third win in six outings. They have also drawn one and lost two. The goal was scored in the 62nd minute by Dinesh Shaw. Duttas team isnt badly aligned, at least on paper. They are lucky to have Kalyan Chowbey under the bar, barring which they could have sunk lower Saturday. They have the experienced Dulal Biswas as one wingback and another young aspirant, Bimal Sarkar, on the other. The midriff has Jayanta Sen and there is Bhabani Mohanty in the forward line. Of course, a lot of this thrust is offset with the presence of the lumbering Eugene Gray, who neither has speed nor the presence of mind at the goalmouth. The biggest obstacle for the team could be its coach. Duttas theories are ageing as quickly as himself and need a revitaliser. The first half was RFCs. An early miss when Chowbey made one of his rare bad misses was followed by Suraj Mondals stretching of the defence with ease. One failed to understand why Dutta persisted with Gray when he could have added punch to the attack with a fresh pair of legs. Late in the first half, a Dulal Patra header from inside the box was saved by Chowbey. With a lot many fallen-through matches to be played in quick time to catch up with the rest, Dutta faces a tough task. In the other Super Division match of the day, Wari AC and Bhratri Sangha shared two goals. Himadri Chakraborty scored for Wari and Seikh Ohidul Islam for Bhratri.  Copyright

 Mushtaq ready to catch SA napping
 - Pak leggie looking to be back in selectorsgood books  Mushtaq says he is ready for the challenge Karachi: Rejuvenated Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed has said he is ready for the South African challenge and would do his utmost to catch the Proteas in a spin web. I am ready for the South African challenge and also ready to catch them in a spin web if I am selected, Mushtaq said on his return from England. The portly 33-year-old resurrected his career by taking over 100 wickets in guiding Sussex to their first ever County championship title earlier this month. Mushtaq became the first bowler to take over 100 wickets in an English season since Andrew Caddick and Courtney Walsh achieved the feat in 1998. Mushtaq last played for Pakistan against New Zealand in 2001 and was dropped after the tour of England the same year. Pakistan selectors have hinted they are considering Mushtaq for the series against South Africa who are regarded weak against spin. Mushtaq said he is delighted to learn the South Africans are finally touring Pakistan. I am happy they are coming as my bait, said Mushtaq, who has 183 wickets in 50 Tests and 161 victims in 143 one-day Internationals. The wily spinner was fined Rs 300,000 (around $5,000) in a match-fixing inquiry conducted by Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum in May 2000. Mushtaq said despite going through hard times he never thought of leaving the game he loved. I never got disappointed and thought that hard times are for good times, so I am back in contention again, he said. Former captain Imran Khan last week promoted Mushtaqs case for a recall in Pakistan team.  (AFP)  Copyright

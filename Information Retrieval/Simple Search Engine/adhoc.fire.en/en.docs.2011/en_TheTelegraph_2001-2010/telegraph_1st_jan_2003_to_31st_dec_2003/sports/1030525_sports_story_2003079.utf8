 Klusener omission a mistake: Ford
Durban, May 24 (PTI): Former South African cricket coach Graham Ford has said the national selectors made a big mistake by not including allrounder Lance Klusener for the forthcoming tour of England. I think the selectors did well to select all those who were in the picture, but it was a mistake to leave Lance out. Its a myth that his batting is no longer what it used to be. In his last 26 one-day appearances, he averaged 53, the best of all South African players. The big problem was that he got limited opportunities and often had to come to the crease with only a few overs remaining, Ford said. The former coach also said that the selectors should have added another fast bowler in the squad. I would have liked to have seen someone like Nantie Hayward. The England batsmen are vulnerable against real pace, Ford was quoted by Top Sports, a South African sports magazine. Despite missing the services of Klusener, Ford said he still believes South Africa can pull off their first series win in England since 1965.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 18, 2003  Allabreva may strike it rich 
 [+uc('BY STAR RACER ')+]				 										Calcutta: It is going to be a great sprinting event at the RCTC raceground on Saturday. The likes of Strengthtostrengths, Bold Chieftans, Alcaldes, Allabrevas and River Melodys  all champions in their own right  may definitely ensure that the 1,200m HSBC Cup is bagged by a deserving entry only. The terms of the race may be against the heavyweights like Strengthtostrength and Bold Chieftan but they are capable of taking all by surprise. 				 										But the 53-kg weight seems to favouring the southern migrant Allabreva who had shamed a top-class lot three times in-a-row before switching headquarters. To be ridden by Robert Gowli, the Excaliburs Lake-Melodrama grey horse from trainer Javed Khans yard seems to be maintaining his brilliant form if his recent mock-race in the company of Strengthtostrength is any indication.Yes, if the early pace turns too hot, the seven-furlong specialist like Immaculate or Comedy of Errors could be counted upon to do the damage.

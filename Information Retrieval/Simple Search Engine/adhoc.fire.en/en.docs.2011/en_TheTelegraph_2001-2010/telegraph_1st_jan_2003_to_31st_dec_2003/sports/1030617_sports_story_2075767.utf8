 Rookie pacer in WI squad
Kingstown: Eighteen-year-old pace bowler Jerome Taylor was named on Monday in a 14-strong West Indies squad to face Sri Lanka in the first of two Test matches, beginning Friday. The young Jamaican impressed selectors with two for 39 on his international debut in last weeks third and final one-day match against the tourists. Taylor was at it again on Sunday with two for 22 for a West Indian Presidents XI side against Sri Lanka, bowling the touring sides top-scorer Maravan Attapatu (59) in the process. Taylor initially caught the eye with an eight-wicket haul for Jamaica against Trinidad earlier this year and has effectively leap-frogged fellow Jamaican Daren Powell and 21-year-old Tino Best into the Test squad. Experienced pace bowlers Mervyn Dillon and Vasbert Drakes were called back into the squad after being left out of the final one-day game against Sri Lanka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sanjay Bangar likely to open
 - A team tri-series - India, Sri Lanka kick off tri-series at Eden Gardens today  BY A STAFF REPORTER  The three A team captains Hemang Badani, Shahid Afridi and Russel Arnold with the trophy India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be vying for at the Eden over the next nine days. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Eden Gardens staged a tri-series final just over a month ago and is all decked up again to stage another tri-series. This time, not just the final, but all seven matches. And though interest in this tri-series is nowhere near the earlier one, it has to be said that the intensity of competition here wont be far behind the one that got over on November 18. No contest featuring even the A teams from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka can be dubbed a low-key event. Especially if a team from Pakistan comes to India after over four years and if the Indian team includes four members from the squad that reached the World Cup final earlier this year. Star-value wise, the Kenstar tri-series will be no mean affair. It gets underway on Monday, with the India-Sri Lanka clash. Now, a match between A teams can be tricky for players. On the one hand, they face this pressure of impressing selectors in order to get back to the senior national team. On the other, they cant afford to forget that even here, there remains this pressure to perform as a team and to win. It needs a balance between individual and collective goals. India A captain Hemang Badani has promised that the personal goals will be superseded by the consolidated goal in course of the next few days. That can be difficult, but something more arduous awaits him ahead of the first match  finalising the playing XI. This can be problematic, particularly while picking the bowlers and finding the right opening combination. Indications are that Sanjay Bangar, who has opened in Tests but never in limited-over Internationals, will face the new ball with the left-handed Gautam Gambhir. There were talks of opening with Dinesh Mongia, but it appears that the thinktank prefers a left-right opening combination. Bangar can also chip in as the third seamer, which will be essential considering the early, 8.45 am start. In all probabilities, India A will field six specialist batsmen in Bangar, Gambhir, Badani, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif and Mongia. Wicketkeeper Ajay Ratra will of course be there along with seamers Amit Bhandari and Munaf Patel. The fight is for the remaining two slots and it is between seamer Siddharth Trivedi, spinners Sairaj Bahutule and Sarandeep Singh and allrounder Mithun Minhas. Chances are that Minhas, who bowls off-spin, and either Bahutule or Sarandeep will make the XI. This means Rohan Gavaskar will miss the first match. On paper, the India A team appears strongest of the three with ten among the 14 having earned the senior national cap, either in Tests or ODIs. The Sri Lanka A team is not so rich in experience but they recently held India A 1-1 in a Test series after going one down. Captain Russell Arnold knows how hot it can be in the cauldron of international cricket and has tasted both success and failure at the highest level. Excluded from the national team of late, Arnold too has a personal score to settle here. See the idea is to always do well. I am not under any pressure and trying to enjoy my game. We are here with the goal of at least reaching the final. Personally, my failure for the national team has been caused by a combination of things, difficult to point to any single factor. This is definitely a chance for me to do well, but the bigger aim is to do well as a team. Lankan coach Hemantha Devapriya said his team will go in with six specialist batsmen, of whom some can also be counted as part-time spinners. He identified seamer Nuwan Kulasekhara, batsmen Chamara Silva and Tilina Kandamby as the players to watch out for. Apart from Arnold and Silva, other national team rejects in their squad are Nuwan Zoysa and Jehan Mubarrak.  TEAMS INDIA A (likely): Sanjay Bangar, Gautam Gambhir, Hemang Badani, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh, Dinesh Mongia, Mithun Manhas, Ajay Ratra, Amit Bhandari, Munaf Patel, Sairaj Bahutule/Sarandeep Singh.

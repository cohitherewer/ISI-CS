The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali a huge hurdle for NZ
Colombo: The challenge of mastering Sri Lankas hot and humid conditions or the low-bounce sub-continental pitches fades in significance for New Zealands cricketers when compared with the prospect of facing off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan in the two-Test series starting Friday. Five years ago, New Zealand squandered a first-Test victory to succumb to a 1-2 loss in their last tour to Sri Lanka as the batsmen were foxed by Muralidharans treacherous tweakers. Muralidharans 19-wicket haul in three Tests dashed New Zealand skipper Stephen Flemings dream of winning a Test series in Sri Lanka, and the ace spinner says he wasnt even in his prime then. Ive added more variety to my spinning art in recent years, says Murali, who is the countrys highest wicket-taker with 437 dismissals in 73 Tests and is aiming to overhaul the 500-mark this year in Tests against New Zealand, the West Indies and England in the pipeline. Contemporary crickets most bewildering yet controversial spinner, Murali says hes prepared to give up playing oDIs to chase this dream. (AP)  Copyright

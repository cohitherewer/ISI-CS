 Martyn out of Test squad
	 - SERIES vs BANGLADESH  Martyn has yet to recover from finger surgery Sydney: Damien Martyn has been left out of Australias squad for the two cricket Tests next month against touring Bangladesh as he recovers from finger surgery. But the right-hander has been deemed fit enough to play in the three one-day Internationals against the visitors in Australias tropical north. Martyn, who missed the April-May West Indies tour in the Caribbeans after having surgery on a finger broken during the World Cup, was not considered ready to play in the Test matches, national selection chairman Trevor Hohns said in a statement Friday. However, Martyn has been included in the 13-man one-day squad for three limited overs matches in August, although his selection is subject to a fitness test in Cairns ahead of the first match August 2. In Martyns absence, Martin Love retains his place in the Test squad, with no room for rising star Michael Clarke, who has missed selection in both squads. Hohns said Martyns non-selection in the Test squad was to ensure he would be fully prepared for future international cricket. Damien Martyn hasnt been chosen for the Test matches because his injured finger just isnt quite right, Hohns said. THE TEST SQUAD Steve Waugh (captain), Ricky Ponting (vice-captain), Andy Bichel, Adam Gilchrist, Jason Gillespie, Matthew Hayden, Brad Hogg, Justin Langer, Brett Lee, Darren Lehmann, Martin Love, Stuart MacGill, Glenn McGrath. THE ODI SQUAD Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist (vice-captain), Michael Bevan, Andy Bichel, Jason Gillespie, Ian Harvey, Matthew Hayden, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Darren Lehmann, Damien Martyn, Glenn McGrath, Andrew Symonds. Carlisle to miss tri-series Zimbabwe batsman Stuart Carlisle was ruled out of a tri-series against England and South Africa on Friday after undergoing surgery on his broken right thumb, adds a report from London. The 31-year-old Carlisle spent Thursday night in hospital after suffering the fracture fielding against Somerset on Tuesday. He will be sidelined for between three to six weeks. Streak said Stuart Matsikenyeri was in line to replace Carlise in the side.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

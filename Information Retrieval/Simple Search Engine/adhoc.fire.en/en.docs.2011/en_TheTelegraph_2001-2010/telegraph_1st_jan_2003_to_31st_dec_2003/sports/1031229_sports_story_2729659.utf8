The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tough to beat the team you once played for: Reid
 - Getting expertise from overseas has helped India, says Indias bowling coach  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Melbourne: At six-feet-eight,  Bruce Reid was quite a sight. Yet, being light in build,  that frame just wasnt able to take the burden of fast bowling.  Soon enough, the left-armer began having fitness problems  and a promising career ended in 1992-93 itself. Of course,  Reid continued to play for Western Australia (till 1995-96),  but batsmen on the international circuit were happy he didnt  have to be tackled. Currently the Indian teams bowling  coach, the 40-year-old cousin of New Zealands John Fulton  Reid spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the  MCG Test.  The following are excerpts On how he kept himself occupied  after quitting first-class cricket in 1995-96 Till 1999-2000, I kept away from organised cricket... That season, I joined the Western Australia Cricket Association as the second XI coach... Then, last year, I became the bowling coach... Till taking up the second XI job, I was busy with an indoor sport centre Ive set up in Perth... It has facilities for cricket, soccer, netball and volleyball.  On injuries forcing a premature  end to his Test career, in 1992-93 Bowling with a tall and slim body affected my back... Actually, I underwent (back) surg-ery in 1987-88 and made a comeback, but... Perhaps, I would have done better had the injury been a stress fracture and not a problem with two discs... I went through a lot of pain.  On whether the injury could  have been avoided had the present day support staff been  available then Given a chance all over again, I would certainly do some things differently... More than the support staff, cricketers today get adequate rest between Tests... That wasnt so in our time... But, yes, the presence of a full-time physio and trainer has made a difference.  On having operated with  outstanding bowlers like Craig McDermott, Terry Alderman  and Merv Hughes All were high on quality... Alderman relied on swing, McDermott was quick and Merv always gave hundred per cent. The captain only had to throw the ball to Merv and the job would be done... (After a pause) Looking back, being Perth-based, I had the chance to idolise and learn from Dennis Lillee...  On whether, having been  a member of the 1987 World Cup-winning side, he agrees that  victory transformed Australian cricket Definitely... Wed lost some players to the rebel tours (1985-86 and 1986-87) and, so, rebuilding was underway... Winning the World Cup made us believe we belonged to that level...Enabled us become steady cricketers with big dreams.  On the contribution of Bob  Simpson, Australias first pro coach In the mid Eighties, we needed somebody with some standing to take charge... Simmo fit the bill perfectly... The biggest difference he made was in our fielding... He made us realise that in order to be the best, we first needed to be the best in fielding... He lifted our intensity, made us perfect the art of catching in slips... That tradition continues.  On Allan Border, under whose  captaincy Australia won that 1987 World Cup Having played under the Chappells and the Hughes, I dont think it was easy when he got the captaincy... Allan grew with the job.  On whats special about  the Australian cricketers The will to succeed, the will to win... Our degree is higher... I think our aggressive attitude, towards the game itself and not necessarily the opposition, also makes a difference. Moreover, weve been blessed with outstanding players... Imagine, Adam Gilchrist comes at No.7 (in Tests)... In my book, hes an allrounder.  On Indias cricket over  the last 18 years, starting with 1985-86 (his first exposure) The most appreciable change is that the Indians are aware of the requirements of doing well on the international stage... In more recent years, getting expertise from overseas has helped and, then, respecting continuity  be it in the selection of players or retaining John (Wright) as coach... The intensity is the highest Ive seen.  On his thoughts when approached  to be Team Indias bowling coach during this Test series (Laughs) Didnt get much time to think about it... Id enjoyed my stint with Zimbabwe earlier in the season and reckoned taking up this assignment would be a good opportunity...I viewed it both ways: That I would return to international cricket and, that, the young quicks would have the chance to learn something. After all, theres no (Jawagal) Srinath, who doubled up as the bowling captain.  On his post-Sydney Test  plans Im having a discussion... With the captain (Sourav Ganguly) and John... Ill also need to talk things over with my family... At this point, Ill be happier with short-term assignm-ents... In your summer, by the way, Im contracted to be with Hampshire.  On spearhead Zaheer Khan He has the ability to be very good... The hamstring has been a bother and he is seen as inconsistent  outstanding one day and very ordinary the next... He needs to consistently pitch it up and swing, like Ajit Agarkar in the second innings at the Adelaide Oval. Indeed, Zaheer must look to regularly bringing it in to right-handers.  On reverse swing With help from the conditions, can be a weapon.  On the No.1 quick of the  present times Ill go for somebody who retired recently  Wasim Akram. Whatever the conditions, he would swing the ball much the way he wanted... Got wickets at crucial times...  On the batsman who made  him work the hardest Sunil Gavaskar... Javed Miandad wasnt far behind.  Finally, on whether he felt  awkward when accepting the Zimbabwe and India assignments (Grins) I didnt expect Zimbabwe to challenge Australia but, with India, I knew it would be a different game... Look, its a little tough when youre trying to beat the team you once played for... However, Ive been treating this as any other job... How did I feel in Adelaide? That the result was simply great for cricket...  Copyright

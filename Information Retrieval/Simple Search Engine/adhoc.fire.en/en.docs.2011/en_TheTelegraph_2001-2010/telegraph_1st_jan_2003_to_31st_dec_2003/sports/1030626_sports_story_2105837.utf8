 Ronaldinho keen on United move
Paris: Brazils World Cup star Ronaldinho could agree a move to Manchester United as early as Friday, his brother and agent Roberto Assis said Wednesday. The Paris St Germain star is having talks with his club after being linked with 20 million euro moves to United, Real Madrid and Barcelona. Paris St Germain insist the 23-year-old is staying and new president Francis Graille has refused to meet United chief Peter Kenyon. But Ronaldinho wants his future decided as quickly as possible after Brazils elimination from the Confederations Cup. We will talk with the Paris St Germain president and hope to wrap things up by Friday, Assis said. Ronaldinho will be very happy to play for United. Every good player wants to join a team like Manchester. Real president Florentino Perez said he was interested in signing Ronaldinho and leaving him in Paris for a year. (AFP)  Copyright

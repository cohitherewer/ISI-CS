 London bid for 2012 Olympics
London: British premier Tony Blair Thursday said London would bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. Culture secretary Tessa Jowell made the official announcement of a campaign to bring the games to London for the first time since 1948 after a meeting of the cabinet. Blair ended months of speculation by giving his backing to the bid which pitches London into competition against rivals headed by New York, Madrid and Moscow. Londons biggest opponent should be Paris whose mayor Bertrand Delanoe was reported to be set to announce his bid on May 21.The German city of Leipzig is also in the running. The deadline for submissions for the 2012 Games is July 15 when bidding cities have to pay the IOC $ 150,000. (Reuters)  Copyright

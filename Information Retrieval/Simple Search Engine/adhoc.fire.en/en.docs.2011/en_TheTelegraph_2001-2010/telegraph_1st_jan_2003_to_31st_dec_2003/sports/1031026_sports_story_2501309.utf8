The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United go down 1-3 to Fulham
London, Oct. 25 (Reuters): Champions Manchester United crashed to a sensational 1-3 home defeat by Fulham, while Chelsea went top with a 1-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday. Lee Clark gave Fulham a third-minute lead, Diego Forlan levelled for United just before the break but second-half goals from Steed Malbranque and substitute Junichi Inamoto gave the west Londoners their first win over United since 1964. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored Chelseas first-half winner to put them top on goals scored but level on 23 points with Arsenal, who play at Charlton Athletic on Sunday. United stay third on 22 points. Elsewhere, Wolverhampton Wanderers produced an astonishing comeback to beat Leicester City 4-3. Liverpool ended a three-match losing streak by beating Leeds United 3-1 and Newcastle Uniteds revival continued with a 3-0 win over Portsmouth. Michael Owen, Danny Murphy and Florent Sinama-Pongolle scored the goals that gave Liverpool their first league win since September 20 and eased the pressure on manager Gerard Houllier.  Copyright

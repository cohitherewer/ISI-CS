 Whatmore to discuss future with Lanka board
Johannesburg: Coach Dav Whatmore is set to discuss his future with the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) after his sides exit from the World Cup this week. Whatmore, who helped guide Sri Lanka to the 1996 trophy and to the semi-finals this time before losing to Australia, is in his second spell in the role but his contract runs out in two months. I am contracted until the end of May and any decision regarding my personal future will be made with the cricket board after the tournament, he said. There are still some challenges there but it is a case of communications and dialogue after this tournament. Captain Sanath Jayasuriya was happy to reflect on everything the side has accomplished under Whatmore when he spoke after Tuesdays 48-run loss to Australia in Port Elizabeth. Dav has been doing a good job and he has been very good for the boys, he said. He has been there for a long time and when he has been there we have achieved a lot of things. Both Whatmore and Jayasuriya were clear where Sri Lanka had gone wrong as the side finished with three defeats in four matches. We had some good positives over the last 10 games but if there was one area we could have done better it was our batting in the middle, the coach said. They just didnt give us enough runs from time to time and that was the case again against Australia. It was a little bit naughty they just didnt give us consistent assistance when we needed it.

 Ford among three in fray
Colombo: Former South African coach Graham Ford is among three candidates in the fray to succeed Dav Whatmore as Sri Lankas coach, a top official said Thursday. Sri Lankan cricket board chief executive Anura Tennekoon said former New Zealand off-spinner John Bracewell and Australian wicketkeeper Steve Rixon were also in contention. We are talking to all three of them and a decision will be made by the end of this month, said Tennekoon. He said the board had already informed Whatmore that his contract would not be renewed. Whatmore, however, is expected to stay as coach for Sri Lankas home Test series against New Zealand this month and a subsequent triangular ODI series, also featuring Pakistan. Lalith chief selector Sri Lankas sports authorities Thursday appointed former Test off-spinner Lalith Kaluperuma to head a four-member national cricket selection panel, an official said. Tennekoon said sports minister Johnston Fernando had approved the appointment of Kaluperuma, who was named to the selection panel last month. Other members of the panel are veteran Aravinda de Silva and former players Roger Wijesuriya and Ashley De Silva. No word from Sanath Sri Lankan officials are still waiting to hear whether Sanath Jayasuriya will step down as captain after his side crashed out of the Sharjah Cup. Jayasuriya offered his resignation after Sri Lanka lost to Australia in the World Cup semi-finals, but it was turned down by national selectors. There hasnt been anything official expressed to the cricket board. He only intimated to the media in Sharjah that he wants to relinquish the captaincy, Tennekoon said Thursday.

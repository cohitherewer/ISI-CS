 Fate of 22 to be known today 
New Delhi: The fate of 22 athletes caught for doping in the National Games in December will be known on Wednesday after a final hearing by the Indian Olympic Association. The athletes, 13 of them medallists, tested positive in the latest in a series of doping incidents that have dogged Indian sports. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) will formally make the names public and announce the withdrawal of medals on receiving the report of the hearing by its medical commission. We expect most of the athletes to appear, IOA director Darshan Tandon said. He added that the IOA would then inform the national federations concerned to take action. We would also be reporting to the International Olympic Committee which is mandatory, he said.  (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 TV interview lands Latif in trouble
Karachi: Former Pakistan cricket captain and wicketkeeper Rashid Latif faces disciplinary action for criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board and its policies in a television interview, an official said on Friday. Latif has been served a show cause notice for a television interview and the PCB disciplinary committee headed by Justice (retired) Amir Alam will hear the case on a date to be announced later, PCB spokesman Samiul Hasan said. Latif, whose fight against match fixing has put his career at risk, admitted that he breached the players Code of Conduct but stands by claims aired on Thursday night that the boards selection process was fraught with inconsistencies. I couldnt wait and told the public whatever I felt was wrong, Latif said. The coach Javed Miandad and then PCB chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia intervened in the selection process and that derailed the rebuilding process which started off well, Latif had said. He had also criticised chief selector Aamer Sohail and Miandad in a newspaper column earlier this week. Speaking the truth in Pakistan cricket is a sin, Latif said, adding that he regretted coming out of retirement. (AFP)  Copyright

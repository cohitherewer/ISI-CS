The Telegraph - Calcutta

 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Adelaide: Bobby Simpson dropped in at Team  Indias nets at The Oval on Thursday morning and, within  minutes, vice-captain Rahul Dravid was seen exchanging notes.  Not much later, coach John Wright introduced Akash Chopra  and the opener sought tips on facing left-armers.  Others joined in as well.  Ive come on my own... Its always  a pleasure renewing a relationship, Simpson, who was consultant  in the lead-up to and during the 1999 World Cup, told The  Telegraph. Though Sydney based, the former Australian  captain and (World Cup-winning) coach is in town on a private  visit. In fact, Simpson is just back from Jamaica, where he was helping out with the juniors programme. He did, of course, watch the first Test (at the Gabba) on the TV. The Indians did well, yes, but need to improve if they intend to corner Australia, he pointed out. According to Simpson, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has done well to appoint Bruce Reid as bowling coach. Bruce played when I was coach and its a pity that fitness problems affected his career... He sure knew how to bowl and can be beneficial to your boys, he remarked.  Incidentally, commenting on Steve Waughs decision  to retire after the current four-Test series, Simpson said:  Its the right move at the right time...  Copyright

 China down India in quarters
Beijing: China, led by NBA sensation Yao Ming, drubbed India 117-62 in a quarter final group II match of the 22nd Asian Basketball Championships in Harbin in north-east China. Despite leading initially, the Indians could not maintain their superiority over the towering Chinese. After India took the lead 14-11, the Chinese quickly made it 14-13 and never again allowed India to dominate. At the end of the first quarter, China were up 33-15 and they pulled away to a 61-23 lead by halftime. After the break, India improved their game several notches, but that was not enough to stop the Chinese. At the end of the third quarter, the Chinese were up 88-39. India put up a fight in the last quarter scoring 23 points, but the Chinese also raced ahead and crossed the 100-mark. India still have two matches against Lebanon and Japan. The top two finishers from the two quarter final groups will enter the semi-finals. The winner of the Championship will qualify for the 2004 Athens Olympics. (PTI)  Copyright

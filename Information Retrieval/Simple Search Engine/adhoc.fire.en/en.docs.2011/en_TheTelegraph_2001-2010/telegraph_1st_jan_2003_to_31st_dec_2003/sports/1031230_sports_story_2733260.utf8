 Bayern coach is FAs target 
 - Contingency plans underway if Sven-Goran Eriksson leaves after Euro 2004  FROM HENRY WINTER IN LONDON  Ottmar Hitzfelds charisma is  a plus point Ottmar Hitzfeld, the hugely successful coach of Bayern Munich, has been targeted by the Football Association to succeed England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson. Soho Square officials hope the Swede will sign a contract extension to 2008, but if he departs after Euro 2004, as many expect, the FA will set their sights on luring Hitzfeld. The distinguished German, who has guided Bayern and Borussia Dortmund to Champions League glory, is the preferred choice of Mark Palios, the FAs new chief executive, whose strong personality is beginning to resonate around English football. Since taking over at the FA, Palios has talked about the need for a contingency plan in case Eriksson leaves, which is standard practice in the business world where Palios has spent the last 20 years. Hitzfelds qualities and track record make him an obvious candidate. Hitzfeld, 54, is the manager considered the Continents best by no less an expert than Sir Alex Ferguson, who asked the German to coach a World XI against Manchester United at the Old Traffords managers testimonial. In the 1999 Champions League final the result went Fergusons way rather than Hitzfelds, but the German has usually finished on top. A diplomatic and devoutly religious man, Hitzfeld has shown at Bayern, the ego-ridden FC Hollywood of German football, that he can handle big personalities. Outspoken characters such as Steffen Effenberg and Lothar Matthaeus have often talked of their admiration for Hitzfeld as a tactician and man-manager. Like Eriksson, Hitzfeld never criticises his players in public. So inspiring of respect that he is known in Germany as Der Gentleman, Hitzfeld has a reputation of continually getting the best out of players in his 20 years as a coach. Born near the Swiss border and having first trained as a maths and PE teacher, Hitzfeld enjoyed a modest playing career, largely in Switzerland, spiced with 22 appearances for Stuttgart. He then coached for eight years in Switzerland, including two titles with Grasshoppers of Zurich, before galvanising Dortmund, whom he led to the Bundesliga title. Since 1998 he has shaped the fortunes of Bayern, who have consistently reached the final or the last four of the Champions League while winning four of the past five Bundesliga titles. Palios understandable admiration for Hitzfeld is only partly rooted in the Germans myriad qualities. The FAs chief executive feels that there are no English coaches of the requisite calibre with Sir Bobby Robson deemed too old by the FA and Steve McClaren too inexperienced. Palios is prepared for the FA to go foreign again, particularly with Eriksson having been such a positive influence. While the FAs ambition in seeking to recruit the most respected coach in European football is admirable, many obstacles lie in their way. A principled man not given to breaking contracts, Hitzfelds Bayern deal expires in 2005 with talks on a one-year extension expected next spring. The feeling in Germany is that Hitzfeld wants to succeed Rudi Vller as Germany coach after the 2006 World Cup finals. Other problems for the FA include Hitzfelds poor grasp of English. The FA would also need to gauge domestic reaction to a German managing England. Hitzfelds nationality is less of an issue to Palios, who simply wants to recruit the best, while Englands players would be presented with the opportunity of working with an accomplished coach feted by their own club managers. The big wish within Soho Square is for Eriksson to commit himself to England long-term; if he signed the new deal on the eve of the squad departing for Euro 2004 it would give the players a huge fillip. But whenever Eriksson leaves  he has constantly been linked with Chelsea  the FA will turn to Hitzfeld, though they face a considerable task in tempting him from Germany.

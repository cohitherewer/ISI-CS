The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sri Lankan eyes trained on India-NZ  tie
 - Jayasuriya amp; Company praying  that sub-continental cousins win Johannesburg: Sanath Jayasuriyas  Sri Lanka face an agonising wait till Friday evening to  know if their World Cup campaign is still alive. All they can do till then is pray   for Indias success. Sri Lankas only hope of staying  in contention for the semi-finals is if India continue their  good form and crush New Zealand in their last Super Six  game at Centurion on Friday. If the Black Caps win, the Lankans  may as well not take the field against Zimbabwe in East  London on Saturday for Stephen Flemings men would already  have taken the fourth and last semi-final spot after Australia,  India and Kenya. There is little we can do, but  wait and see how our luck holds, Sri Lankan coach Dav Whatmore  said. Well obviously have an eye  probably both eyes   on the India game tomorrow but theres no question we  also have to train for the game the next day. If India oust the New Zealanders,  Sri Lanka will have to beat Zimbabwe to qualify for the  semi-final against reigning champions Australia at Port  Elizabeth on Tuesday.  Whatever the outcome, skipper  Jayasuriya knows he will have to play the rest of Sri Lankas  campaign with a broken thumb, the legacy of a Brett Lee  special last week. Sanaths forearm is not a problem  but the left thumb is broken right at the tip and he will  only fully recover after the World Cup, said team physiotherapist  Alex Kontouri.  Batsman Hashan Tillekeratne, however,  will be fit to play after missing the 183-run defeat against  India on Monday. Whatmore insisted the players  had themselves to blame for facing the prospect of an early  flight home. It is difficult to have sympathy  for the boys when they play like that, Whatmore said after  the heavy defeat against India at Centurion.  According to a report from  East London, Sanath Jayasuriya is suffering from tonsillitis  but will be available for the Zimbabwe game. Jayasuriya, who has also been  taking pain killers sat out training on Thur- sday. Sri Lanka manager Ajit Jayasekera  said: We didnt want him to exert himself because he is  recovering from a severe attack of tonsillitis. But we do expect him to be available  for Saturdays game.

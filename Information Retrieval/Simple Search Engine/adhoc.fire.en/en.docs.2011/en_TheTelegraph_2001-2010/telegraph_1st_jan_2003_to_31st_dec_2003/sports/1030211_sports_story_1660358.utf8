The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gordons first session
  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Paarl: Hot-shot sports psychologist Sandy Gordon had his first session with the Indian cricketers Monday evening. Gordon, who met the squad for around two hours at the team hotel, will continue his interaction Tuesday. I intend speaking one-to-one as well, Gordon told The Telegraph at the Village at Spier. He declined to talk about his interaction, but one learns he spoke at length about the mental approach and, then, fielded questions.  Copyright

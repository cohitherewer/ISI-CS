 Ronaldo saves Reals day

(Reuters) Madrid: Brazilian striker Ronaldo saved Real Madrid when he scored a late goal to give the champions a barely deserved 1-1 draw away to a dominant Osasuna on Saturday. The modest Navarrans, enjoying a great start to the season, took an early lead with a top-class finish from Ivory Coast striker Ibrahima Bakayoko. But although they created a host of scoring chances Osasuna failed to extend their advantage and were made to pay when Ronaldo raced on to a through ball from David Beckham, outsprinted one defender, fended off another and tucked home the equaliser. Real remained top of the table with a one-point advantage over Deportivo Coruna. Osasuna moved back into fourth spot, a further four points behind Valencia. Earlier, lowly Murcia were rewarded for their persistence when they twice came from behind to claim a 2-2 draw at home to Real Sociedad. Murcia, who drew 2-2 with Valencia last week, remained 19th in the 20-strong league, while Sociedad moved up one place to 15th. Real Madrid, who made the trip north without injured midfielders Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo and defender Roberto Carlos, began with Esteban Cambiasso and Guti in the centre of midfield, while Beckham reverted to his former position on the right flank. But they never looked comfortable at a packed El Sadar and it was Osasuna who were the first to show when Bakayoko controlled a flying cross with his back to goal, swivelled round and volleyed just over the bar on five minutes. Real failed to heed the early warning, though, and six minutes later the former Olympique Marseille player put the Navarrans ahead with a cool finish. Receiving the ball on the edge of the area from fellow striker John Aloisi, Bakayoko checked inside Ivan Helguera and fired the ball past Real keeper Iker Casillas with a fierce left-foot finish. The champions recovered their nerve a little on the half hour mark when Ronaldo produced a couple of his trademark jinking runs that provided the first threats to the Osasuna defence. But it was Osasuna who continued to dominate as they poured through the middle and tormented the Real defence. Bakayoko looked certain to extend the Navarrans lead 12 minutes into the second half with a dizzying run into the heart of the Real area, but the striker was dispossessed just as he was about to line up his shot. The Navarrans manufactured a host of further scoring chances but were unable to put the ball away and it was Primera Liga leading scorer Ronaldo who made them pay dearly when he scored the equaliser 16 minutes from time to take his tally for the season to 10 goals. Inter Milan recovered from their midweek Champions League mauling by Arsenal to hand Italian champions Juventus their first defeat of the season with a shock 3-1 win at the Delle Alpi stadium on Saturday. Argentine striker Julio Ricardo Cruz struck twice as Inter put their 5-1 home defeat by Arsenal behind them with a superb display to end Juves 11-month unbeaten home record in Serie A. The result was Inters first league victory at Juventus in over 10 years  their last was 2-0 in March 1993  since when they have managed just two draws and one goal in the fixture. Juventus will lose top spot in the standings if AS Roma or AC Milan win on Sunday. Cruz fired Inter ahead in the 12th minute with a brilliantly taken free kick. The Argentine, deputising for the injured Christian Vieri, added the second in the 69th minute, reacting well to fire home after his first shot was blocked by Juve keeper Gianluigi Buffon. With Juventus pushing forward in search of a way back into the game, 19-year-old Nigerian Obafemi Martins raced on to a Cruz flick and danced past Nicola Legrottaglie before slipping the ball under Buffon to make it 3-0. Juve defender Paolo Montero pulled one back for the champions in the final minute but that was no consolation at the end of a game which pushed Inter right back into the title race under new coach Alberto Zaccheroni. Lazio also suffered a surprise defeat 3-0 away to Siena thanks to two first-half goals from Brazilian Rodrigo Taddei and a late strike from his compatriot Fernando Menegazzo. After Dejan Stankovic missed a glorious chance for Lazio in the 19th minute, firing high and wide from just two metres out, Taddei put Siena in the lead, blasting home after the Lazio defence had failed to clear a cross from Gianni Guigou. Two minutes later the Brazilian doubled the advantage after poor work from Lazios Serbian defender Sinisa Mihajlovic. Nicola Ventola whipped the ball away from Mihajlovic as the defender was trying to usher the ball out for a goal kick and fired over a low cross, which Taddei slotted home. Sienas Norwegian striker Tore Andre Flo then missed an easy chance, firing over when unmarked inside the area, before Stankovic was sent off in the 67th minute for dissent. Menegazzo wrapped up the victory in injury time after being set up by the outstanding Taddei. The result moved Siena up to seventh place, while Lazio stayed fifth. (Reuters)  Copyright

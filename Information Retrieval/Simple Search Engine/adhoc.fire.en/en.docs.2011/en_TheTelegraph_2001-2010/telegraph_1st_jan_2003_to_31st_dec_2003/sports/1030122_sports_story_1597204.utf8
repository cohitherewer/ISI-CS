				 																																	Zurich: Farah Weheliye Addo, president of the Somali Football Federation, has been banned from soccer two years following comments he made against Fifa president Sepp Blatter last year, the world governing body said on Monday.				 																																	Fifa said the sanction related to comments made by Addo in February 2002 citing irregular financial practices that were intended to assist the election of Blatter to the Fifa president in 1998.				 																																	Fifa said Addo had made accusations against Executive Committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam, of Qatar, and questioned the integrity of Blatter. Addo had been unable to produce evidence to Fifas Disciplinary Committee when asked to substantiate his claims, the body added.				 																																	Havana: Diego Maradona has found a new sports passion: golf. I admit that I dont feel the same emotions on the golf course as I did kicking the ball around, the former soccer great said during a tournament on Sunday.				 																																	But I play absolutely every day, training like an animal. Sometimes when I am sleeping I wake up because I am dreaming that I made a wrong move and I stand up and repeat it in my room.				 																																	Maradona said it has been difficult to learn to lower his voice on the course. Sometimes I talk loudly, I yell, I get excited and everyone gives me dirty looks. It bothers me a bit but I still find golf an exceptional sport.

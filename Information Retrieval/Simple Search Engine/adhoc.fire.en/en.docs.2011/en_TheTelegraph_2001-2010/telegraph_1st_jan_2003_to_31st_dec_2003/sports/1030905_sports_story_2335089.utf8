Two of East Bengals experienced and star defenders  Dipak Mondal, Debjit Ghosh  were red-carded at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday, while midfielder Sur Kumar Singh suffered an ankle injury which might sideline him for some time. According to team doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, Sur Kumar has injured a ligament in his ankle and needs an X-ray to determine the extent of the injury. Currently, that ankle has been immobilised, which means he needs rest. Dasgupta added its not certain whether the defensive medio, a key player down the right, has suffered a ligament tear. Only the X-ray will reveal that. But its certain he will miss Sundays match. Sur Kumars recovery time is usually quite fast, but this one may take a while.  Copyright

(AFP)				 										Liverpool, England, April 5 (Reuters): Montys Pass, a first Grand National runner for Irish trainer Jimmy Mangan, won the worlds most famous steeplechase on Saturday. Ridden by Irish jockey Barry Geraghty, the well-backed 16-1 chance came home 12 lengths in front of 40-1 outsider Supreme Glory, partnered by Leighton Aspell. It was a brilliant, brilliant performance. He travelled so well the whole way through. I havent many horses, and hes the star of the stable, Mangan told BBC TV. Geraghty added He was like a cat. It is hard to believe he can win it so easily.				 										Amberleigh House, a 33-1 shot ridden by Graham Lee, was two lengths further back in third, with Gunner Welburn (16-1), who led for a long way on the final circuit in the four miles and four furlong (7.2 kms) slog fading into fourth.

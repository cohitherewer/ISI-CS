 Dempo look to stay on top
Margao: National League leaders Dempo will be looking to consolidate their position when they take on Hayward 2000 Sporting Club on Tuesday at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda. Dempo with two wins and a draw are at the top of the table with seven points while Hayward, who lost to Churchill Brothers in their last match, have four points from three matches. Dempos coach Armando Colaco is unlikely to disturb his undefeated team combination. If their defence is able to contain Haywards sharp shooters  Dudu Omagbemi and Abdulateef Seriki  they will hold edge over their rivals. The midfield and attack will have to capitalise on early chances and will have to be more precise with their finishing, which has been below par in the last two encounters. For Hayward, their first two outings were impressive but the midfield failed to muster a combination against Churchill Brothers. (PTI)  Copyright

 Champion denies switching samples 
Vancouver: Bulgarias Olympic weightlifting champion Galabin Boevski has denied that he tampered with doping tests and demanded that he be allowed to compete at the world weightlifting championships here. I deny everything, the Sydney Games gold medal winner and world record holder in the 69-kilogram category declared on Saturday. He and teammates Gueorgui Markov and Zlatan Vanev were banned on November 12 from competition after testing positive. (AFP)  Copyright

 Too much cricket taking its toll: Kapil
 Kapil Dev at a press conference in New Delhi Wednesday. (PTI) New Delhi: Kapil Dev hit out at the Board of Control for Cricket in India on Wednesday saying its failure to give rest to players was resulting in injuries to key members before important tournaments.There are people in the board who have played cricket for more than 20 years. I hope they know what it takes to play non-stop cricket throughout the year, said Kapil, who was here to announce the dates for presentation of the Hero Indian award.Citing the instance of India having to participate in the Dhaka tri-series just three weeks after the World Cup, Kapil said the players should have been given at least a months break before embarking on any international tour. They are playing cricket throughout the year. They need time to spend with their families, manage their accounts and do other personal work.They should have been given at least a months break after the World Cup. But instead they are straightaway heading for Dhaka, he said.Indias only World Cup-winning captain, however, said positives could be drawn from the seniors absence as it would give opportunities to youngsters at the highest level. It is good for the youngsters. They have the chance to prove their mettle at international level. The Haryana Hurricane also said he was not in favour of appointing foreign coaches though he did not have anything against incumbent John Wright. We have so many top-class former players in the country. Why should we appoint someone from outside when we can have someone from within the country.But he parried questions about whether he was interested in taking up the job again if the BCCI came up with an offer after the expiry of Wrights contract.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CBI silence on Jadeja is baffling
  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta, Feb. 1: Its not known whether the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has made a quiet move, but its silence on the Ajay Jadeja issue has left many baffled. The CBIs investigation into match-fixing effectively set in motion the five-year ban eventually slapped by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), in December 2000. And, now that a Delhi high court-appointed arbitrator has set that aside, the CBI should be saying something at least. The agency must defend its investigation, is how a well-placed source put it this afternoon. Speaking to The Telegraph, the source added: It isnt just that the CBIs indictment was so severe. After all, BCCI commissioner K. Madhavan, who conducted his own inquiry, was guided by the evidence collected by the CBI. In effect, then, the arbitrator has nullified the agencys rather sensational findings. Earlier this week, Justice (retd) J.K. Mehra, the arbitrator, quashed the ban imposed by the BCCI  technically, by its then disciplinary committee  and tore into Madhavans report, which formed the basis of the BCCIs action. The BCCI, of course, now has 84 days (the countdown began on January 27) to respond appropriately. While legal opinion is being sought, Justice Mehras action has already triggered an internal debate. Given the sensitivity, its too early to say anything, but while some feel the award (enforceable after 90 days) ought not to be challenged, others are quite firm about doing exactly that. Apparently, the club-match fiasco the other day, featuring Jadeja, has infuriated the latter lobby even more. With 27 months having passed since the government went public with the CBIs report, not many may remember its conclusions specific to Jadeja (page 159), a former stand-in captain. Actually, the CBI left nothing unsaid. The conclusions read: Ajay Jadeja is very close to some bookies and big-time punters, namely Uttam Chand (a.k.a. Topi), Rattan Mehta, Rajesh Kalra and Krishan Kumar (implicated in the Hansie Cronje case). He gave assessment of cricket matches to Rattan Mehta, a big-time punter. He also passed on information to bookie Uttam Chand (a.k.a. Topi), for monetary considerations. He also met M.K. Gupta and offered his services for fixing matches and received money from M.K. at that meeting. He is also named by Mohammed Azharuddin as one of the players who was with him in fixing matches. Incidentally, Madhavan, a former CBI director, had this to say in his final opinion: (1) He (Jadeja) had very close undesirable contacts and objectionable nexus with various bookies/punters; (2) He is guilty of unbecoming conduct and misconduct as a national-level player on account of his maintaining such frequent contacts as set out above with bookies/punters. For the record, the BCCI will be taking Madhavans opinion too into account when finalising its response to Justice Mehra. Whatever his present stand, the one-time sleuth will pretty much be the cynosure.  Copyright

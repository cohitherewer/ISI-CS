The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. in damp draw 
 - SUPER DIVISION - Ever-Readys Jeremiah neutralises Sheikh Sanjib strike  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Habeeb Adekunle tackles Ernest Jeremiah at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting gambled with lucky breaks and lost chances on a turf that suddenly became soggy after a blast of rain, ending their Calcutta Football League Super Division league Championship leg tie versus Ever-Ready Association 1-1 at the Salt Lake Stadium Friday. Mohammedan Sporting went ahead in the 28th minute of the match through Sheikh Sanjib and Ernest Jeremiah restored parity in the 24th minute of the second session of play. Play had started slowly, with most of the action around the midfield. The teams were tentative, but a blast of heavy shower sent them scrambling to the shade. Play was held up for about 17 minutes, so sharp was the downpour. Back onto the ground, which was by then already retaining water and soggy, there was a little more action and more goalbound moves. Then, in the 28th minute of action, Khaleque Siddique chested a ball down at the top of the rival box and Seikh Sanjib took control. He shot at goal, but the ball came off a poor attempt at save from goalkeeper Kalyan Chowbey. Sanjib trapped it again, dodged past Chowbey on the ground and placed in. The second half saw an Ever-Ready resurgence. Mohammedan Sporting defenders were on their toes as attacks came. Jeremiah made amends in the 24th minute of the second half when substitute medio Surojit Chakraborty centred to the top of the box and the former had no problem tapping it home.  TEAMS Mohammedan Sporting: Amar Deb, Amjad Ali (Hussein Mustafi, 60), Habeeb Adekunle, Syed Hussein, Madhab Das, Amandeep Singh, Bungo Singh (Iqbal Khan, 61), John Abowei, Khaleque Siddique (Dipankar Chakraborty, 80), Seikh Sanjib, Dipendu Biswas. Ever-Ready: Kalyan Chowbey, Dulal Biswas, Surojit Chakraborty, Wajed Ali, Rajib Ahmed, Jayanta Sen, Biswarup Bisu (Sanjib Chakraborty, 64), Shankar Roy Chowdhury, Satyajit Bose, Eugene Gray, Ernest Jeremiah. Referee: Kashinath Sen.  Tollygunge held The other Super Division match of the day, between Tollygunge Agragami and Mohammedan AC, was a pretty tame affair, with neither team being able to break the deadlock. And of the three matches of the Super Division Relegation leg, one, in which Eastern Railway beat Wari AC 2-0 (Kuntal Biswas and Farid Ali Mollah scoring), was played. The matches between Bhratri Sangha and Railway FC (at East Bengal ground) and the one between Port Trust and West Bengal Police (at Mohammedan Sporting) could not be played due to the grounds unplayable condition after the shower.

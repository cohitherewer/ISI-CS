 MCC honour for Flower, Olonga
London: Andy Flower and Henry Olonga have been made honorary life members of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in recognition of their World Cup protest against Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe. The duo wore black armbands during Zimbabwes opening World Cup match in February, against Namibia in Harare, and issued a statement mourning the death of democracy in Zimbabwe under Mugabe. It was a move that effectively signalled the beginning of the end of both players international careers. After the World Cup the pair arrived in England with Flower playing County for Essex and pace bowler Olonga turning out for celebrity club side Lashings. In a statement, MCC president Charles Fry said: Both the membership committee and the main MCC committee were unanimous in wanting to honour Andy Flower and Henry Olonga. They sacrificed their international careers to take a brave and principled stand against an appalling regime.  (AFP)  Copyright

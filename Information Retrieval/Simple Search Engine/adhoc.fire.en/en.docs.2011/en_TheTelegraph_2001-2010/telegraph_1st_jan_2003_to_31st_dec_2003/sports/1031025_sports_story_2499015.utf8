The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Randhawa pushes to joint fifth
		 Randhawa says he has found  his feet in JapanNew Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa fired a superb seven-under  65 to climb to the tied-fifth position at the mid-way stage  of the 100 million-yen Bridgestone Open on the Japanese  PGA Tour, underway at the par-72 Sodeguara Country Club  in Chiba.  The other Indian in fray, Jeev Milkha Singh, disappointed  with his second straight one-over 73, forcing him out of  the draw for the deciding rounds. Singhs tournament tally stood at two-over 146, tying him at 84th position. Hiroyuki Fujita led the field at 12-under 132, along with fellow Japanese professional Daisuke Maruyama, while Australian Paul Sheehan was placed third, one stroke behind the leaders. Hajime Meshiai occupied the fourth position at ten-under 134, while Randhawa and Naomichi Ozaki shared the fifth place at nine-under 135. Randhawas second day round had just one blemish. A bogey on the 14th. Otherwise the 31-year old hardly erred. Birdies dotted his card on the third, sixth and ninth to place him at three-under at the lemon break. Thereafter he went on a birdie blitz, burning up the Sodegura course with five more birdies on the 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and 18th. I have found my feet on the Japanese PGA Tour and hope to make the most of my form this week, Randhawa said.  He returned 26 putts and found 15 greens in regulation,  while Singh struggled on the greens returning as many as  34 putts for this round.  (PTI)  Copyright

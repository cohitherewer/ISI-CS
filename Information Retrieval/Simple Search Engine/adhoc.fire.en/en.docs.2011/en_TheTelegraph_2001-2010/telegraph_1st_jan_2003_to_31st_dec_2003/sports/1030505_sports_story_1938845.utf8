The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ slip to 75 for 4
Kandy: Sri Lanka made early inroads with the new ball after a delayed start to grab the initiative in the second and final Test against New Zealand Sunday. New Zealand, opting to bat first, lost three wickets to the new ball and one to the spin of Muttiah Muralidharan in the 34-over evening session to finish the second day on 75 for four when bad light halted play. The first day was completely washed out and no play was possible before tea on Sunday because of a waterlogged outfield. Left-armer Chaminda Vaas dismissed opener Matt Horne (1) and Mathew Sinclair (3) to take two for 18 in his first eight-over spell. Prabath Nissanka, playing in his second Test after his debut in the first Test, claimed the key wicket of the in-form Stephen Fleming. Fleming, who scored an unbeaten 274 and 69 not out in Colombo, accumulating a record 343 run aggregate for a New Zealander in a Test, was trapped lbw for a duck. Mark Richardson,and Scott Styris then consolidated  milking the spinners for singles during a 60-run partnership for the fourth wicket. But Muralidharan had Styris caught at silly point after scoring 32 with five boundaries. At close, Richardson was unbeaten on 32, with five boundaries. The umpires, finally satisfied with conditions after an army of groundstaff had mopped up the worst parts of the ground, started the game at 3.30 pm (local time). New Zealand were soon in trouble, losing Horne in the third over. Eight balls later, Fleming was lbw to Nissanka. When Sinclair made a misjudgment, padding away an inswinger from Vaas to be adjudged lbw, New Zealand had slipped to 11 for three.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

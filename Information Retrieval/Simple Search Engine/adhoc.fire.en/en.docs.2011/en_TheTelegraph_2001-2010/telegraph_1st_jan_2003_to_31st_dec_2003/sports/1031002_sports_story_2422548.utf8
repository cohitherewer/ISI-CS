 Fergie to be worlds best paid manager
 Alex Ferguson has accepted an extension till 2007 London: Alex Ferguson is set to become the worlds highest-paid manager after agreeing to extend his contract at Manchester United for another four years on 3.5 million ($5.8 million) a year.  The Daily Mirror reported on Wednesday the 61-year-old Scot, in charge at United since 1986, had accepted an offer from the United board that would keep him at Old Trafford until the end of the 2007 season. Ferguson signed a three-year deal in 2002 after changing his mind about retiring when United appeared set to make England coach Sven Goran Eriksson their manager. Fergie, who has two years of his current deal to run, told the Daily Mirror: Weve had meetings and the club has made certain proposals for an extra two or three years. I received all the details from my solicitor this morning and were sorting everything out Its not easy to get excited at my age, but the important thing is its what I want to do. I feel strong and healthy and theres no point in retiring. Ive talked before about the mistake I made a couple of years back when I said I was going to step down. Firstly you have to consider your health. Those are questions Im very comfortable with. At some point Im going to have to hand over to whoever replaces me. And when that happens, I know the club will be in fantastic shape. Ferguson has won eight League titles and the 1999 European Cup at United although he appeared to be on the way out when he went through his first four years without a trophy. Frenchman Eric Cantona arrived from Leeds United in 1992 to inspire United to their first championship for 25 years. Having made the decision to stay on, I started to re-plan how the club was going to progress over the next few years, said Fergie. Ive started regenerating the squad by bringing in younger players, and the youth system is better than its ever been. But Ferguson cannot see himself emulating Newcastles Sir Bobby Robson, and staying in charge at United until he is 70. I cant see me doing that, said Fergie.  (AFP)  Copyright

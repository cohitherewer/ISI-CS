 Put country above self: Wright
Bangalore: Coach John Wright has asked members of the Indian team to put country above self-interest as the side prepares to start a packed new season, commencing with a Test series against New Zealand at home from October 8. Fans and people of India deserve a team that fights. Winning and losing is part of the game. Its how you win and how you lose. The players must always play as a team and fight. Wright said at a function here last night. India are set to play two Tests at home against New Zealand, followed by a tri-series also involving world champions Australia as the third team. They will then tour Australia, where the team will play four Tests and also participate in a tri-series. We are trying to establish that. First everyone must understand that country is most important. Team is more important than you. Team comes first. You yourself is not important, he said. Our role and that of players, particularly senior players, is to make everyone understand that they are representing the country. Team is more important than individuals, he said. It does not matter where you come from... Your background... What you eat... What your religion is. You should put your efforts totally into the teams cause. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sporting let victory slip
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Churchill strike twice in dying minutes to salvage unlikely  win  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Churchill Brothers Osumanu Husseini (left) makes a futile attempt to throttle the advance of Mohammedan Sporting attackers at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting let go a one-goal advantage in the dying minutes of their National Football League clash with Churchill Brothers and suffered a shocking 1-2 defeat at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Till the 89th minute, Mohammedan Sporting looked all set to notch up their maiden win in their fifth match and in the very first one under new coach Jamshed Nassiri, after Edeh Chidi gave the home team a 56th-minute lead. Churchill Brothers, however, kept up the pressure after that goal and the Mohammedan Sporting defence was living on the edge in the face of constant attacks from the opposite end. One such attack found Osumanu Husseini inside the box. The Ghanaian central defender promptly pushed the ball to substitute Nitin Pradhan on the other side and the latters shot was blocked by a Mohammedan Sporting player. The Churchill left-back S.A. Firoz, who went up to reinforce their attack, quickly pounded on the rebound, putting a dampener on the home team and a handful of spectators, anticipating a much-needed win. But there was more twist to the drama and whatever substance Mohammedan Sporting wanted to salvage following that setback, came to absolute nothingness three minutes into the final injury times. It was Yusif Yakubus brilliance all along as he hit the final nail on the home teams coffin. Rajesh Meetei released a ball for his Ghanaian teammate near the opponents halfline. Yakubu went about a few yards shoulder to shoulder with his challenger Madhab Das and outran him to break free down the left corner of the 18-yard area. His solo run culminated in a deft and unstoppable right-footer which left goalkeeper Gumpe Rime with little chance to come in its way. We went down to East Bengal in the last minute (thanks to Bhaichung Bhutias injury-time strike). And it was the other way round today it was perhaps destiny, Churchill Brothers coach Marcos Pacheco later said. My right side did not function well. Odafa (Okoli) was ill and had to be substituted, while I also missed Satish Bharti (who missed the tie due to hamstring injury). These two factors severely weakened my defence on the right, Nassiri, who took over only on the match-eve, said. Chances fell in the way of both teams on numerous occasions. The visitors, though, had to curse their luck as three of their attempts on goal were denied by the woodwork. However, Mohammedan Sporting should have gone ahead in as early as ninth minutes, when Dipendu Biswas header forced a goalline save from Meetei. The action switched ends soon after when Hardip Sangha, brilliantly fed by Yakubu, could not convert a simple chance with Rime being at his mercy. Chidi then opened up the face of the goal on a couple of occasions, but he shot wide from close. However, the Nigerians persistence and activities in and around the rival box finally paid off. Bungo Singh, who replaced Odafa, started the move and Rahim Nabi floated one from the right. Chidi met the cross with a timely jump and the ball struck the inside of the far post before going in. Mohammedan Sporting suddenly retreated deep into their zone and allowed the rivals having a free run there. Osumanu could not hit the target from near the six-yard box and Firozs long-ranger crashed onto the crosspiece. The black-and-white defence looked vulnerable and jaded also to some extent until it finally broke down a minute from the final whistle. In the end, even a new coach could not bring about the winning luck for Mohammedan Sporting. They have remained on a single point while Churchill rode Fridays three points to be on ten after five matches. Teams Churchill Brothers: Mark Mascarenhas; Roque Perreira, Osumanu Husseini, S.A.

 Lara wants to stick to young side
 Stuart MacGill celebrates one of his five scalps in Bridgetown on Monday. (Reuters) Bridgetown: The West Indies captain Brian Lara, whose team went 0-3 down to Australia after losing the third Test on Monday, said he wanted to stick with his young side and was not concerned about an impending whitewash. The West Indies, with an average age of around 25, suffered three consecutive home defeats for the first time and could also suffer their first home whitewash if they lose the fourth and final Test in Antigua, starting Friday. The records are not really my main worry. Thats of little importance, said Lara, adding that better days lay ahead. We have got some very good players here and they are on the verge of making the breakthrough in Test cricket. Im quite happy with the look of the team, I want us to play cricket the way we are playing. We are not to going to play Australia every day of the week. Its all about character building and that is what is happening. He added: The experienced players have been tried and tested, a lot of them have come up short and I dont see any need to go back to them. In the batting department, we have done pretty well. The batting is going to take care of itself. Lara admitted he had miscalculated after the tourists made a match-winning 605 for nine declared. The pitch came up short, he said. Jacobs returns Meanwhile, West Indies wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs has been included in the 14-man squad for the fourth Test against Australia, which starts on Friday. The West Indies selectors have also named Mervyn Dillon and Marlon Samuels, who were both left out from the final XI for the Bridgetown Test, in the squad. Meanwhile, uncapped paceman Brad Williams will fly home to Perth on Thursday following the return of Glenn McGrath .  (REUTERS)  Copyright

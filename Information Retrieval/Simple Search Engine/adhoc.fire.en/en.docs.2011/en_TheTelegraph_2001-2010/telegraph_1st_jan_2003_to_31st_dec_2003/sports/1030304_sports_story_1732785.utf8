 Tiger Woods wins world match-play
Carlsbad: Tiger Woods captured his second title in three events since returning from knee surgery, defeating David Toms 2 and 1 on Sunday in the world match-play championship final. I was fortunate to have come out on top, said Woods. I missed a lot of putts. Woods, the reigning US Open and Masters champion, collected $ 1.05 million for the success. The 27-year-old American has eight major victories but had never won this event. He lost in the final three years ago to Darren Clarke and got knocked out in last years first round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA in sight of victory
 - Best stand for both teams but Rudolph  steals show Jacques Rudolph  (left) after completing his double century on debut  in Chittagong Saturday. He shared an unbroken record  third-wicket partnership of 429 with Boeta Dippenaar  Chittagong, April 26 (Agencies):  Jacques Rudolph became only the fifth player to score a  double century on Test debut as South Africa continued to  dominate the first match against Bangladesh Saturday. South Africa declared shortly  before lunch on 470 for two, a first-innings lead of 297,  before Bangladesh made a bold bid to avoid a heavy defeat,  closing Day 3 on 185 for five. The home team needs 112 more to  avoid innings defeat. The 21-year-old Rudolph finished  on 222 not out  the second highest score by a Test debutant.  He also became the first South African to score a double  century in his first Test. Other players to have scored double  centuries on Test debut are West Indian Lawrence Rowe, Brendon  Kuruppu of Sri Lanka, Matthew Sinclair of New Zealand and  Englands Reginald Foster. Boeta Dippenaar made a career-best  178 not out, and his unbroken partnership of 429 with Rudolph  was the highest for any wicket for South Africa, surpassing  the 368-run opening stand between Herschelle Gibbs and Graeme  Smith against Pakistan at Newlands earlier this year. It was also the sixth-best partnership  ever in the history of Test cricket.  The duo of Habibul Bashar and  Javed Omar then posted the best partnership for Bangladesh  by putting on 131 for the second wicket. It was Bangladeshs  best stand for any wicket. Bashar made 75 and Omar 71. Rudolph had to recover from a  nasty blow to the back of the head. He ducked into a bouncer  from 19 year-old fast bowler Mushrafe Mortaza and needed  lengthy treatment. Rudolph raced through the 190s with three  boundaries in an over from Khaled Mahmud and stole a single  off the last ball to reach the landmark. His 383-ball 222 contained 29  fours and two sixes.

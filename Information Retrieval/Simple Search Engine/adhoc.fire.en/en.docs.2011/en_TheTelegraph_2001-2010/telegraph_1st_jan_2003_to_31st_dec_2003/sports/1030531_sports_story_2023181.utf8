 Sheer power carries Serena 
- Agassi, Mauresmo breeze into pre-quarters l Ferreira crashes out with injury  Serena Williams, en route to a 6-0, 6-0 wipe-out of Austrias Barbara Schett in the third round at Roland Garros Friday Mariano Zabaleta of Argentina is ecstatic after ousting Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco 6-2, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2). (AFP, Reuters) Paris: Serena Williams took just 40 minutes to thrash Barbara Schett at the French Open on Friday in a third round match that bordered on the embarrassing.But Andre Agassi can hold his head high after a breathtaking 6-4 7-5 7-5 victory over Xavier Malisse.While Schett provided no resistance whatsoever to the womens top seed during a 6-0, 6-0 ordeal, an irrepressible Agassi was full of praise for his Belgian opponent afterwards.He is an incredibly talented player sometimes you are watching him playing instead of watching the ball, the mens second seed said.Malisse, a Wimbledon semi-finalist last year, played with flair and power throughout but came up against a brick wall in the form of Agassi. Swatting the ball around court, the 1999 champion never allowed Malisse  immensely talented or not  a chance.Agassi will next face Flavio Saretta after the Brazilian Spains Galo Blanco retired injured with the score reading 7-6 (7-3), 6-3, 2-2.In the womens draw Serena, despite a number of errors herself, was simply too strong for Schett in a match lacking even a modicum of subtlety or guile.Tactics were an irrelevancy as both players struggled to find any consistency. At least when defending champion Serenas shots landed in court they were hit with great power, a difference which won her the match with ease.  A former world number seven  and conqueror of Serenas elder sister Venus here two years ago  Schett won just six points in the second set and 20 in the entire match. Sixteen of those came from unforced errors. In fact the Austrian hit just two winners the entire match. When a clumsy attempt at a drop-shot landed half-way up the net while facing match point she jogged to the net and smashed a ball high into the stands. Shaking her head and smiling in embarrassment she embraced Serena before heading back to the locker room, flushed and smiling shyly. Serena will next face Japans Ai Sugiyama after the 16th seed beat Meghann Shaughnessy of the US 6-1, 6-4. The Japanese was the first to enter the pre-quarters. While Schetts discomfort had been evident to all on Centre Court, Wayne Ferreiras agony was evident to anyone within hearing range of Court One.The South African let out a chilling shriek of agony before collapsing on the court after injuring his groin during his match with 11th seed Rainer Schuettler. Ferreira had to be carried off court as Schuettler received easy passage through to a fourth round clash with Martin Verkerk.Amelie Mauresmo thrilled her home fans with a powerful 6-3, 6-4 win over Colombian Fabiola Zuluaga to reach the fourth round. The fifth seed lined up a clash with either Americas Ashley Harkleroad or Spains Magui Serna. In other matches, seventh-seeded Argentine Guillermo Coria beat Hungarian Attila Savolt 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 while countryman Mariano Zabaleta beat Moroccos Younes El Aynaoui 6-2, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2). Fourth-seeded Spaniard Carlos Moya lost a two-set lead before battling past Juan Ignacio Chela 6-2, 6-3, 3-6, 2-6, 6-3. In the womens section, Hungarys Petra Mandula beat Italys Flavia Pennetta 6-2, 6-4 while Patty Schnyder of Switzerland beat Eleni Daniilidou of Greece 6-3, 6-4. The petite Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium continued her flight upwards past Dally Randriantefy of Madagascar, whom she thrashed 6-1, 6-1.

 Kirsten shelves retirement plans
London: Gary Kirsten has shelved talks of retirement and insisted the series climax at The Oval wont be his last Test. The 35-year-old Kirsten had said earlier he would quit after the series. The twin targets of 20 Test hundreds and becoming the first South African to play 100 Tests in sight influenced Kirsten to change his mind. (PTI)  Copyright

 Pak want ICC to review laws
			PCB feels Shoaib got a bad dealKarachi: Pakistan are to push the International Cricket Council (ICC) to review the enforcement of the Players Code of Conduct and the laws on ball-tampering and throwing. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Tauqir Zia and chief executive Rameez Raja left for London Friday for the ICC executive committee meeting where they will raise the issues. We believe that the Code of Conduct is not being enforced consistently and we feel this is not good for the sport, Rameez said. We have received good support on our stand from some quarters including India and that is a good sign, said Rameez. He said there was a feeling that match officials had different sets of rules for different players while tackling sledging and other issues. We also want the ICC cricket committee to look at the existing laws on ball-tampering and chucking as they are ambiguous in some areas, Rameez added. The PCB had earlier noted that the Match Referee banned Shoaib Akhtar for two matches in Sri Lanka last month for ball-tampering, but no action was taken against players involved in sledging during the series between Australia and the West Indies.  Pakistan will also bring up the  issue of security. Last year, West Indies and Australia  refused to tour Pakistan, while New Zealand have recently  said they do not want to play in Karachi in November after  witnessing a bomb blast on their last visit there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Close shave for Gareth Batty
Galle: England spinner Gareth Batty went into Tuesdays first Test against Sri Lanka after being rescued from the sea outside the team hotel a day earlier. Batty had been body-surfing with captain Michael Vaughan and Matthew Hoggard on Monday afternoon when all three were caught by a rip tide that washed them away from the coast. The well-built Hoggard managed to swim ashore, while Vaughan scrambled onto some rocks and alerted lifeguards as Batty struggled to escape the strong currents. There was a point when I feared the worst, said the 26-year-old, clearly shaken. The rocks I was getting washed up against were hellish sharp. Vaughany could tell I was struggling and he was getting pretty animated on the rocks. (AFP)  Copyright

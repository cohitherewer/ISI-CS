The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Frank Bruno reportedly on drugs
London: Englands former heavyweight boxing world champion Frank Bruno denied claims Sunday he was using drugs to fight depression and he urged the media to back off and stop terrorising him. The 41-year-old, who won the WBC title when he outpointed Oliver McCall over 12 rounds at Wembley in 1995, has been the subject of intense media coverage in recent weeks after checking into a well known drugs and alcohol rehabilitation clinic after the collapse of his marriage. If I go to the toilet, its front page news. I dont think anybodys got a right to tape, bug, film, follow, terrorise someone like theyve been terrorising me, and I think its about time people just back off and give me a little bit of breathing space, he told BBC Radio 5. Hitting back at accusations that he was Britains answer to Mike Tyson Bruno said: Im not the English Mike Tyson, Im the English Frank Bruno I always was. Bruno described himself as a prisoner in his own home and admitted he had endured a rough time of it following his divorce from his wife Laura. But he stressed: Ive been through a lot of pressure, a lot of stress and things like that, but Im feeling stronger and stronger and stronger every day. Asked directly if he had taken steroids or cocaine, the former boxer turned pantomime performer replied: Not that I know of, no. He added: Could all those people who are saying that Im taking drugs and whatever, could they come to my house and let me drug test them and see how much drugs theyve got in their bodies? Why dont people who say Im doing whatever come to my house? (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another washout
Colombo: Sri Lankas one-day captain Maravan Atapattu believes his teams rain-ruined series win over England will boost the players confidence for the three Test matches next month. Sri Lanka claimed the ODI series 1-0 following total washouts of the second and third games in Colombo on Friday and Sunday. The home team had notched up a crushing 10-wicket victory in the first game in Dambulla. The prospects of play had looked good on Sunday morning after a largely dry weekend but a torrential tropical storm minutes before the scheduled toss left large swathes of a muddy outfield under water. It was obviously disappointing as we were here to play cricket and there is nothing worse for a cricketer than staying in the dressing-room, Atapattu said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

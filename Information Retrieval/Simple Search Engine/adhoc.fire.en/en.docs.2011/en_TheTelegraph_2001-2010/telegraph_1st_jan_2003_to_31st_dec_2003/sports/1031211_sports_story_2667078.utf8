The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kumble likely to replace Harbhajan
 - Never Have a Backward Step theme retained for Adelaide Test as well  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Singapore: The Indians are looking to effect  one change in the XI which drew the first Test versus Australia  in Brisbane. The second of four Tests, in Adelaide, gets  underway on Friday.  According to The Telegraphs  sources, veteran Anil Kumble is tipped to replace Harbhajan  Singh, who finished with just one wicket at the Gabba. In  the other camp, by the way, theres talk of Brad Williams  taking Andy Bichels place. Harbhajan hasnt been in form and, so, a common view is that Kumble should make the XI, one of the sources pointed out, when contacted in Adelaide. Also, its not insignificant that the leggie already has 358 wickets under his designer belt. In fact, Harbhajan was unimpressive in the tour-opener as well (against Victoria), taking two for 159. Kumble, on the other hand, had four for 74 in the Queensland Academy of Sports first innings. Actually, Harbhajan was far from his best in the recent tri-series too and could find it difficult making a comeback as long as Team India has a 3-1 attack. However, its not that Kumble wont be under pressure. After all, he is set to be fielded on a track which is always seen as the finest for batting. For the Indians, the good news of course is that Zaheer Khan, who had a hamstring problem in Brisbane, is fit. If theres a worry, its that Virender Sehwag isnt sending out positive signals at the very top of the order. For now, though, fingers are crossed. Meanwhile, Sourav Ganguly and Co. have decided to retain the first Tests theme  Never Have a Backward Step  for the second as well. Psychologist Sandy Gordon had suggested the players adopt a different one for each Test, but nobody wants to change something which worked at the Gabba.  Its an understandable sentiment.  LIKELY INDIAN XI Akash Chopra, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S.Laxman, Parthiv Patel, Ajit Agarkar, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra.  Copyright

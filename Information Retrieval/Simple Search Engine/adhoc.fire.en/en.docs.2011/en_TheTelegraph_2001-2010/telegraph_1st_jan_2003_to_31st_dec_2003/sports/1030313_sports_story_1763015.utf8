The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe stumped by Kenyan magic
 - Co-hosts set up semi-final clash  with India after facile victory Kenyas Ravindu  Shah jumps into the arms of teammate Collins Obuya after  Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak was dismissed for a duck  during their tie in Bloemfontein Wednesday. (Reuters)  Bloemfontein: Kenya recorded  a famous seven wicket victory over fellow-Africans Zimbabwe  on Wednesday to become the first non-Test nation to qualify  for the World Cup semi-finals. Thomas Odoyo struck a powerful  43 off 40 balls with eight fours as Kenya easily reached  their meagre victory target of 134 from exactly 26 overs  in the Super Six match. He shared an unbeaten partnership  of 73 with Maurice Odumbe (38 not out). Kenya, who have still to meet  the unbeaten defending champions Australia in the second  round, will play India in the semi-finals. Zimbabwe were  eliminated. Our target was the Super Sixes  but then we reviewed our target, said captain Steve Tikolo.  Kenya took 10 points through to the second round after beating  Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. They were awarded four points  when New Zealand refused to play in Nairobi because of security  fears. We just decided to go out and  be positive, Odumbe added. Normally low scores are very  tricky so we just decided if there was a ball to hit we  would hit it. Its a great feeling and Im sure people  back home are happy. For Zimbabwe only Andy Flower  came to terms with the slow pitch and accurate bowling,  scoring 63 as Zimbabwe were dismissed for 133 off 44.1 overs.  It was their lowest total in 15 matches against Kenya, who  had never beaten them before. Opening bowler and Man-of-the-Match  Martin Suji dismissed Craig Wishart (5), Alistair Campbell  (7) and Grant Flower (7). Leg spinner Collins Obuya then  had wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu caught behind for three with  the fifth ball of his first over, Dion Ebrahim stumped for  13 and captain Heath Streak caught at slip for a duck. Andy Blignaut was run out for  four after a horrible mix-up with Andy Flower and Flower  was bowled by Odoyo. Credit must go to Kenya, they  stuck to their disciplines as they have done all tournament,  said Streak. Unfortunately our batters got out to some  soft shots. Campbell, who has not played for  six weeks and was recruited from the television commentary  box after Mark Vermeulen fractured his skull, looked rusty  before being trapped in front by Suji. Grant Flower became  Sujis third victim when he slashed at a wide delivery and  was caught behind. Zimbabwe slumped to 66 for four in the  21st over when Taibu edged a leg break from Obuya to Otieno. The same combination accounted  for Ebrahim, who ventured past a delivery and was easily  stumped. The most avoidable dismissal of  the innings followed nine overs later when Andy Flower and  Blignaut sprinted towards the same end. Otieno dashed to  the other end and ran Blignaut out for four. Streak had yet to score when he  edged a ball from Obuya to Ravindu Shah at slip, and Zimbabwes  hopes of posting a respectable total ended when Flower was  bowled around his legs by seamer Odoyo to make it 114 for  eight in the 36th over. Captain Steve Tikolo wrapped up  the tail with his off-spin by having Henry Olonga caught  by a diving Maurice Odumbe at short mid-wicket for three  and then bowling Douglas Marillier for a dogged 21. Kenya made an uncertain start  to their reply when Shah was dropped twice and survived  a confident appeal for caught behind before being run out  for 14 at the non-strikers end in the eighth over. Fast bowler Blignaut laid a hand  on Otienos fierce drive, and the ball hit the stumps with  Shah out of his ground. Two overs later Tikolo, on two,  attempted a pull shot to a delivery from Blignaut and skied  it to Streak in the covers. Kenya were 62 for three in the  17th over after Otieno was trapped in front for 19 by Olonga. But any thoughts Zimbabwe had  of making a comeback into the match were snuffed out by  Odoyo and Odumbe. Odumbes innings lasted only 20 balls  and contained eight fours. (Reuters) Copyright

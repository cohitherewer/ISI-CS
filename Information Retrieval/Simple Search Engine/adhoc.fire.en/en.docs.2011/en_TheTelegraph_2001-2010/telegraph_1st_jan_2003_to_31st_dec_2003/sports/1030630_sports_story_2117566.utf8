 Collymore bags seven

(AFP) Kingston: A seven-wicket burst by fast bowler Corey Collymore helped West Indies dismiss Sri Lanka for 194 before lunch on the third day of the second and final Test Sunday. The hosts, who made 191 in reply to Sri Lankas first innings total of 208, have two-and-a-half days to score the 212 runs they need to seal a series-winning victory. At lunch, West Indies were 20 for one in their second innings, requiring another 192 runs. Collymore had reason to celebrate after being recalled to the side for the first Test last week, four years after his only previous Test appearance. His figures of seven for 57, the best by a West Indies bowler since Courtney Walsh took seven for 37 against New Zealand in 1995, followed his two for 28 in the first innings and five for 67 in the drawn first Test against Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka resumed on 129 for five, with skipper Hashan Tillekeratne on two and Mahela Dharmasena on nine. Collymore made an early breakthrough by clean bowling Tillekeratne (seven). Chaminda Vaas stroked four boundaries in a brisk 21, but he lost his partner when Dharmasena, on 20, edged Collymore to Brian Lara at slip. Vaas quickly went the same way, edging Collymore for Lara to take another low diving catch.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 City to host natl one-day meet
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 19: There will be a feast for the citys cricket connoisseurs this season. After the one-day tri-series final on November 18, the city will host the national one-day meet from February 5 to 11. The top teams from the five zones will take part in the seven-day tournament. The CAB authorities are planning to have some of the matches of the tournament held in the newly-acquired Jadavpur University ground in Salt Lake. The preparatory work has already started and we plan to have the ground ready before the February tournament, a senior CAB official said. However, Siliguri may ask for some of the matches as well. Siliguri hosted the Ranji Trophy fixture between Bengal and Railways last season. Meanwhile, Bengals Gentleman Cricketer of the Year, Utpal Chatterjee wants to be a part of the CAB XI for the forthcoming KSCA invitational tournament starting on July 31. Though the CAB authorities intend to have a junior side for the meet, Chatterjee wants to play in the tournament to make himself match-fit. Chatterjee also added that he had come to take the award since it was named after the legendary Pankaj Roy. The Player of the Year award is surely more attractive, said Bengals highest wicket-taker in Ranji Trophy.  Copyright

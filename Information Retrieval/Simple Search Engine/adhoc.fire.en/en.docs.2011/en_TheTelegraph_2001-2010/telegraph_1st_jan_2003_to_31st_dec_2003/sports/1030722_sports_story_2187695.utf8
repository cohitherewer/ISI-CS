The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gough hits back at doubters
 Criticism spurred Gough on London: England paceman Darren Gough has hit back at the doubters who wrote him off as a Test bowler following his recall for the forthcoming first Test against South Africa at Edgbaston. Goughs inclusion in the England squad for the Test, which starts on Thursday, came two years after his last five-day match. After battling with injuries for 18 months which have seen Goughs right knee operated on three times, medical experts advised the Yorkshireman to retire this year rather than continue to pound his troublesome knee. But the 32-year-old fast bowler, who defied advice to prosper in Englands recent one-day triangular series triumph over South Africa and Zimbabwe before being named in the Test squad, said: To all those people who doubted me, bad luck. Proving them wrong has been my inspiration. I have proved that with determination and pride you can come back whatever the difficulties you face. I have always wanted to go my way, not to be told by others that its time to pack it in. Im totally confident that I am ready for Test cricket again and the encouraging thing is that the general public in England want me to play.  (AFP)  Copyright

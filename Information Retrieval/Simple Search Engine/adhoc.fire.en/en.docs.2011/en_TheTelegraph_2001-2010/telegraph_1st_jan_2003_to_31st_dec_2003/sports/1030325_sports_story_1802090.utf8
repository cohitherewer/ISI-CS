The Telegraph - Calcutta
 $500m illegal bets on final
Johannesburg: Jeff Rees, the newly appointed ICC Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) chief, has said up to $500 million may have been illegally wagered in Mumbai alone for the World Cup final between India and Australia. Rees, who replaced Paul Condon as the general manager of the ACU, also said despite all efforts the India-Pakistan match on March 1 attracted illegal betting of more than  50 million in Indias commercial capital. But Rees emphatically noted that the World Cup 2003 had been free of corrupting influences. We are quite confident this has been a clean tournament, Rees was quoted as saying in the Australian daily The Age.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Johl stays joint 2nd 
Seoul, May 3 (AP): South Korean Chung Joon fired a four-under-par 68 for the second straight day on Saturday, taking a three-stroke lead, while Indias Amandeep Johl too retained his joint second place after the third round of the $400,000 Maekyung Open golf championship here. Chung birdied the first, sunk an eagle on the par-five fourth hole and added another birdie on the fifth at the Nam Seoul Country Club, just south of Seoul. Chung then seemed to lose his touch and bogeyed the seventh, tenth and 13th holes. He bounced back with three more birdies to finish with 10-under 206, eyeing his first win in seven years.

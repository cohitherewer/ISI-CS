The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India A draw
 Mohammed Kaif hit a gritty unbeaten 50 Ahmedabad: Sri Lanka A nearly turned the tables on a jittery India A as the first of the three four-day Test matches ended in an exciting draw on the final day at Motera on Wednesday. Set to chase 184 in 31 overs, the hosts lost four quick wickets, and finished at 102 for five. Mohammed Kaif, however, cracked a gritty 50 not out and was well supported by keeper Ajay Ratra (26 not out). Earlier, the Lankans were bowled out for 308 (PTI)  Copyright

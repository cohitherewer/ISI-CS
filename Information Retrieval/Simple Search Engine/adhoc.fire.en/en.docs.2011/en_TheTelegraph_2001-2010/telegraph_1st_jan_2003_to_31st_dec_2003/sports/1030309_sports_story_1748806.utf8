The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jayasuriya still in doubt
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Johannesburg: Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya remains in doubt for Mondays Super Six game against India. Jayasuriya was hit by Brett Lee in Centurion, Friday, and the region between his left elbow and wrist is still pretty sore. I cant say anything with a degree of certainty... We will have to wait and watch, coach Dav Whatmore told The Telegraph Saturday afternoon. Jayasuriya is also understood to have suffered a hairline fracture on his thumb. Only, that alone shouldnt stop him from taking the field in a crucial match.  Copyright

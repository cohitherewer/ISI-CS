The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latif, Moin left out
Karachi: Pakistan selectors on Thursday left out experienced wicketkeepers Rashid Latif and Moin Khan from a list of 22 probables for the one-day series against New Zealand starting later this month. We are looking to the future as far as one-day cricket is concerned and since Kamran Akmal has been playing well he has been preferred as wicketkeeper, chief selector Aamir Sohail said.  Pakistan play the first of five  matches in Faisalabad on November 22. (AFP)  Copyright

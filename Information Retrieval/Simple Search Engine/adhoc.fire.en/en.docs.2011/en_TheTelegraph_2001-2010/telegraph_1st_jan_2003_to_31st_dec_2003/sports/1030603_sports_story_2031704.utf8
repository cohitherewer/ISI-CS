 Wright warning for seniors 
Bangalore: India coach John Wright feels that a number of keen and hungry youngsters are waiting in the wings and can force their way into the national team if any of the seniors are complacent and lack consistency. We dont want players to rest on their laurels. So, you need to be performing consistently all the time... And its important for them to know that young and keen players will try and force themselves into the top side, Wright said Monday. Wright is here to assist Sandeep Patil, the India A coach, who is currently conducting an 18-day training camp at the National Cricket Academy ahead of their six-week tour of England. Asked whether any of the India A players can make the senior team, Wright said: It always depends on the performance of the incumbents. What I can say is that if theres competition, it will do Indian cricket a world of good. Elaborating on his current assignment, he said: Its very good for me because I get to work with some of the boys who might have an opportunity to force themselves into the top side. I am looking forward to it. Wright made it clear there will be no clash of coaching styles between Patil and him, as both are working for the same purpose. I have played against him (Patil). I admire him for the job he has done for the Kenyan team. Its important coaches learn from each other. Meanwhile, terming his new assignment a challenge, Patil said: Boys are looking good. He felt its for the boys to create opportunities and make their way into the senior side. The former Kenya coach expressed hope that the tour would offer a broader view for the selectors when they select the Indian team for the home series against New Zealand. Patil has also been joined by Madanlal, one of the bowling consultants of the NCA, to assist him in that department.  (PTI)  Copyright

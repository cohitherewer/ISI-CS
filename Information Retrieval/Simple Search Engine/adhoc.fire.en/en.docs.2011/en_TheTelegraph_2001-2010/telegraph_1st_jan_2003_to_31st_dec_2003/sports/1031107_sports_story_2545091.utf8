 Clijsters, Capriati charge ahead
Los Angeles: Defending champion Kim Clijsters and Americas Jennifer Capriati posted impressive victories at the $3 million WTA Championships on Wednesday. Capriati overcame a strained right hip and fought off four set points in the second set to take out Japans Ai Sugiyama 7-5, 7-6 in Black Group round-robin play. For her part, Belgian world No. one Clijsters whipped Russian Elena Dementieva 6-2, 6-2 on the opening night in Red Group play. But fourth seed Amelie Mauresmo was upended 6-4, 4-6, 2-6 by eighth seed Chanda Rubin. In winning her first match since falling in a titanic US Open semi-final to eventual champion Justine Henin-Hardenne, Capriati played a highly aggressive contest, taking huge cuts from the baseline and powering in big serves when she needed to. The American had suffered a strained right hip flexor in practice early in the day, but managed to fight off four set points and played a superb tiebreak. After she shook off an off-the-court backhand pass down the line by Sugiyama at 6-2, she won the contest with a huge inside out forehand. Im pretty happy, said Capriati, who notched her 400th career victory. The top-ranked Belgian was a backboard from the ground and completely suffocated the Russian, committing only nine unforced errors. I felt really good, said Clijsters, who will play Rubin next. I was very consistent and its a good feeling to have. There wasnt a moment I was down and I didnt make any easy mistakes.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Tendulkar, Zaheer in World XI
Durban: Despite the lacklustre performance of the Indian cricket team in the World Cup final, two of its players have been chosen by a local newspaper group for a World XI consisting of the best players of the tournament. The Independent newspaper group named Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan as the only two Indians to represent the World XI. While Tendulkar was chosen for his superb batting performance throughout the tournament, the newspaper said it had chosen Zaheer because he and Australias Brett Lee would still be around for the next World Cup in the West Indies in 2007. It singled out Tendulkars 98 against Pakistan and Ricky Pontings match-winning unbeaten 140 in the final for special praise. The newspaper named Adam Gilchrist and Herschelle Gibbs as openers pushing the Indian batting maestro to the middle order. West Indian Ramnaresh Sarwan has also been chosen as a batsman and The Independent predicts that he could very well be one of the stars of the next World Cup. World XI Adam Gilchrist, Herschelle Gibbs, Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar, Andrew Symonds, Michael Bevan, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Brett Lee, Zaheer Khan, Andrew Bichel and Muttiah Muralidharan. 12th man: Lou Vincent.

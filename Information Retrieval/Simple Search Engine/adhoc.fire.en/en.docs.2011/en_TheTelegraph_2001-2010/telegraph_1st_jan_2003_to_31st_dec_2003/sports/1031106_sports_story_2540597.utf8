The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pathan hopeful of making Aussie trip
 Pathan has modelled himself on Wasim Akram Islamabad: Its been a dream tour of Pakistan so far for Irfan Pathan. Twelve wickets in two games (including nine for 16 against Bangladesh on Tuesday) and the Baroda paceman has started nurturing hopes of boarding the flight to Australia later this month. It is the ultimate dream of every cricketer to represent his country. There is no greater achievement than that and I leave it for Allah and selectors to decide, Pathan said from Lahore. I hope I have made a mark. I will be extremely delighted to join the senior team, the left-arm seamer said. However, he is not quite content with his nine-wicket haul. Pathan wanted to take all ten to emulate Anil Kumble, but V. R. Singh took the other wicket to leave him stranded just short of the magic mark. Wasim is my idol and I have moulded my game watching him, Pathan said, quite happy with the fact that he achieved the feat in Akrams hometown. But the 19-year olds immediate aim is to help the side win the title. Sri Lanka is a good team but we are strong enough to beat them, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

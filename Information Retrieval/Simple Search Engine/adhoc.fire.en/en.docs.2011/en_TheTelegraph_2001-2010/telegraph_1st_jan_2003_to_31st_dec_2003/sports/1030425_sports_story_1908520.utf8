 Kapils advice for Sachin at 30 
 Sachin Mumbai: Wishing Sachin Tendulkar, who turned 30 Thursday, a very long life, former skipper Kapil Dev hoped that the Master Blaster will continue to enthral his fans for many more years.Tendulkar still has six to seven years of international cricket. I hope he continues to perform at the same level, Kapil said. He also advised Sachin to pay more attention to his fitness for prolonging his career.Once a sportsman crosses 30-year mark, he should concentrate more on his fitness and exercise regularly. Sachin is the worlds best batsman, but he too needs to keep an eye on his fitness. Former BCCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur said:I have known Tendulkar since he was 14. I can proudly say he is a far more matured batsman and this maturity will help Indian cricket, Dungarpur added. (PTI)  Copyright

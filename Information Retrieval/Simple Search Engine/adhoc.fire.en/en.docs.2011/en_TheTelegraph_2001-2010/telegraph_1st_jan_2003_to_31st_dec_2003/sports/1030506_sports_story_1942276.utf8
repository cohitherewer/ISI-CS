The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Doherty catches up with Williams
Sheffield: Ken Doherty demonstrated his fighting qualities yet again by coming back from 5-11 down against Mark Williams to level the world championship final at 12-12 after Mondays penultimate session. Doherty, who also came from behind to beat Paul Hunter in the semi-finals, won the opening frame of the afternoon after Williams missed a long red. Williams, the new world number one, conceded the next frame, after being left needing snookers, and Doherty also won the 19th with a 128 clearance. Doherty won the next two frames to move within a frame of Williams, and then levelled at 11-11 after the Welshman failed to pot the yellow. A scrappy 23rd frame ended with Williams winning his first frame of the day. But 1997 champion Doherty claimed the last frame of the session with a 115 clearance. Doherty will now fancy his chances of clinching the best-of-35-frames final.  (Reuters)  Copyright

 Kallis completes English last rites
 - SA clean up five wickets in 50 minutes for 2-1 lead  The South African team celebrates a wicket on the final day at Headingley on Monday. (Reuters) Leeds: Jacques Kallis took a career-best six for 54 as South Africa thrashed England by 191 runs on the final morning of the fourth Test on Monday to go 2-1 up in the series. England, set an unlikely 401 to win at Headingley, resumed on 165 for five but capitulated to 209 all out within 50 minutes and 70 deliveries. Mark Butcher was dismissed on the second ball of the day to begin the procession. Allrounder Kallis, who took nine wickets in the match, collected four for 16 on Monday morning in just 33 deliveries with his away swingers. He proved the perfect stand-in after South Africa went into the match without Shaun Pollock, who returned home to attend the birth of his daughter. England captain Michael Vaughan, however, hailed Man-of-the-Match Gary Kirsten as the key after his innings of 130 and 60, his runs in effect being the margin between the sides. I thought he was outstanding, and probably the difference between the two sides. They were more disciplined and played smarter cricket than we did, Vaughan said. There were situations when we should have been more ruthless. Kirsten, in his 92nd Test and who is considering retirement at the end of the series, batted for more than 11 hours on an unreliable and uneven pitch. I dont think I have played in a Test match wicket like that before, the left-hander said. South Africa skipper Graeme Smith added: We want to go to The Oval and make it 3-1, not just hold on to our lead. I dont know how much England wanted it, but our boys definitely did, even when we were 21 for four and 142 for seven (in the first innings). A lot of guys stepped up to the plate in this game. Meanwhile, former captain Nasser Hussain is doubtful for the fifth Test. He suffered a fracture of the big toe on his left foot after being hit by Andrew Hall while batting on Saturday. Hussain, who stood down as skipper after the drawn first Test, said: Its pretty sore and its broken going into the join but undisplaced at the moment.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

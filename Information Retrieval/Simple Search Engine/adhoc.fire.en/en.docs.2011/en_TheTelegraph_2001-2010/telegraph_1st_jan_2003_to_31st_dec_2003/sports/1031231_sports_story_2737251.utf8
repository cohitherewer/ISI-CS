 Bilardo back in former club
Buenos Aires: Argentinas 1986 World Cup- winning coach Carlos Bilardo has returned to Estudiantes, less than three months after resigning due to personal problems. Carlos Pachame, who coached the team in Bilardos absence but managed only four wins and six defeats in 10 matches, will return to his previous role as assistant, the club said. Bilardo, affectionately known as Big Nose, said that being away from the touchline had made him suffer. I was going mad, he told reporters after agreeing terms with club president Julio Alegre. I was turning the radio on and then turning it off because I was powerless to do anything. Earlier this year, Estudiantes persuaded Bilardo to return to the pressures of the touchline to help them battle against relegation. Bilardo, who played for Estudiantes in the 1960s and had two previous stints as coach of the club, had been working as a television pundit since leaving Boca Juniors seven years ago. During his five months in charge, Bilardo fully lived up to his reputation for pragmatic, ruthless football. Estudiantes drew nine of their 17 matches under his guidance, won six and lost only two. They scored only 19 goals and conceded a mere 10. Bilardo has also coached the Colombian national team and led Argentina to second place at the 1990 World Cup. Former Argentina defender Jose Luis Brown, who scored the opening goal in the 1986 World Cup final against West Germany, was named as one of Bilardos assistants.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

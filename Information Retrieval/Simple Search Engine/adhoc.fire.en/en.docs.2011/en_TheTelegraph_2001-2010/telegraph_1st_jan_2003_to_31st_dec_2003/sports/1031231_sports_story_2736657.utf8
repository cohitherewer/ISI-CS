The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roy keen on another striker 
 FROM SAM WALLACE IN MANCHESTER  Roy Keane wants adequate cover for Nistelrooy Roy Keane has warned Manchester United that they will have to buy a striker when the transfer window opens in January if the club are to have adequate cover for Ruud van Nistelrooy. Sir Alex Ferguson has already asked the United board to make an approach for Fulham striker Louis Saha, which the Frenchmans club described as unwanted and unsolicited, but could also target West Hams Jermain Defoe or Aston Villas Juan Pablo Angel, who is keen to play in the Champions League. Keane said: I still think we could probably do with one or two players and maybe the manager is thinking the same. Only a couple of weeks ago we had Scholesy (Paul Scholes) and Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] out at the same time and, please God, nothing happens to another player like Ruud van Nistelrooy. Its the managers department but any player coming into the team or the squad does lift everybody. It would even lift the strikers even though it obviously would increase competition for places. Ive been in the same position over the years with midfielders coming in. What it does is it makes you step up another level. With the one or two injuries weve had, maybe we are not as strong up front as people think we are so we will just have to see what happens. The United captain also hinted that his infamous walk-out at the World Cup last year had help to improve the Republic of Irelands attitude towards training and preparation under their new coach Brian Kerr. I do feel I could still do a job for Ireland, Keane said. Then again, there are one or two players who I wouldnt fancy playing with because of what happened before. Meanwhile, the United share price rose again after The Daily Telegraphs report yesterday that the Russian oil tycoon Ralif Safin was interested in buying a stake in the club which is now valued at almost 700 million. Despite Fergusons original vow to consider an appeal against Darren Fletchers dismissal against Middlesbrough on Sunday by referee Matt Messias, the club has conceded that such an option would be impossible because the player was red-carded for two bookable offences. The United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez will join Marseille as soon as the transfer window opens this week after enduring an exile from the side that began at the end of last season. United also learned Monday that their Champions League opponents Porto have lost their key striker Derlei Silva for the two matches in February. The Brazilian, who is the top-scorer in Portugals top-flight, underwent a knee operation this week that will rule him out for the rest of the season.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anderson ruled out
London: Quick James Anderson will miss Englands Tests against Bangladesh to rest a knee injury, the ECB said on Thursday. However, the 21-year-old, who had been in doubt, will be available for the one-dayers and the Test and one-day series in Sri Lanka. ECB chief medical officer Peter Gregory said Anderson had an overuse injury to one of the tendons in his left knee that would need rest. Anderson is to also undergo a strengthening programme on the knee before flying to Dhaka on October 28 for the ODIs. (Reuters)  Copyright

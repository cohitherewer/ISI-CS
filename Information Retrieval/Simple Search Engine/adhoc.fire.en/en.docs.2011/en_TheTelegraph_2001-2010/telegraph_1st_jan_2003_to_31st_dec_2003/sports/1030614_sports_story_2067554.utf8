The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Surya high on Anand tips
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Surya leaves for the world junior meet Wednesday Calcutta: Surya Sekhar Gangulys preparation for the world junior chess championships got a shot in the arm Thursday with some vital tips from Viswanathan Anand. Surya, Bengals second Grandmaster after Dibyendu Barua, was invited for dinner by Anand, who was here on a promotional trip. We had an hours chat where Anand gave some important tips which will stand me in good stead for the world meet, Surya told The Telegraph Friday. The tournament begins in Azerbaijan on June 20, with Surya leaving on the 18th. Anand talked about a few changes in my opening which I plan to implement in Azerbaijan, Surya added. The former world champion had earlier mentioned while talking to the media that Surya had improved significantly over the past few months. Actually, we have been regularly in touch over the e-mail. He sends me games to analyse and I send him my reply, Surya informed. He made no bones about the fact that these interactive sessions have helped him considerably. Surya added he was facing some problems with his end game. I asked for advice and Anand gladly obliged, asking me to make some minor adjustments. He went on to add that he will sit with Sandipan Chanda in a couple of days to implement the plans chalked out with Anand. Ill practice with him for the next few days Im here and get adjusted to the gameplan suggested by Anand. This will be Suryas last junior world championship and nothing short of a gold medal will please him. Even Anand reminded me to go all out for it, he said. Last year in Goa, he got the bronze. Suryas current Elo rating is 2542, which he wants to take up to 2600 by the end of this year. A good show here will surely help me achieve that goal, Surya added. Going back to the interactive session with Anand, he said: I had analysed the three games which Anand lost last year  against Peter Leko, Alexander Morozevich and Garri Kasparov. I thought he really made a bad move against Leko, which I pointed out and he agreed. Surya, however, ruled out any practice sessions with the champion in the near future. It would have really helped. But he has such a packed schedule that it could not be adjusted, the Bengal champion signed off.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, September 06, 2003  Kader out of danger after the fall 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 Aslam Kader				 										Calcutta: Jockey Aslam Kader, who had a nasty fall from the favourite Karishma at the Pune races on Friday, has suffered multiple fractures in his toe and shine bones according to sources close to the champion rider. The jockeys condition is, however, stable, though he is going to be out of action for the next 12-14 weeks, added the source.				 										Another source from Pune informed that Karishma, the 7-4 favourite in the Fabiha Plate, the first race, was seen badly wobbling right from the home turn. It prompted Kader to ease up the Mischevious Music-Vivifiant daughter as the field approached the distance post. However, 100m from home the F. Abbas-trained mare collapsed and died, unseating Kader who was injured in the process.

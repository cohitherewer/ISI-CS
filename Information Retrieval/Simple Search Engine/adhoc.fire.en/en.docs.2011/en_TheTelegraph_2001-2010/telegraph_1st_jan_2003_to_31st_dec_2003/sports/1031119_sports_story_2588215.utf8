The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gordon for an Indian theme Down Under
	 - Indians are now better tourists  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sandy Gordon at the Eden on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Collective and individual sessions with Sandy Gordon marked Team Indias build-up to their opening 2003 World Cup game, versus Holland. In fact, it was then that the hot-shot sport psychologist suggested a theme be picked for the campaign. Sourav Ganguly and Co. chose Now or Never. On Tuesday, while speaking to The Telegraph, Gordon again suggested the Indians adopt a theme  this time for the trip to Australia. It serves as a vision, a goal... It helps give direction and, so, India should have one for what will be a tough tour, he remarked. Gordon, in town for a Board-funded project on mental toughness (an assignment which entails interviewing former India cricketers), added: The World Cup theme worked rather well and, personally, I was quite pleased with Indias performance... Having self-belief and a vision is necessary. The respected pro iterated: My advice, of course, is simple  take your job seriously, but dont take yourself seriously... Sport isnt about winning, its about getting the process right. Incidentally, he was a member of Steve Waughs support team when Australia won the 1999 World Cup. Looking ahead to the four-Test series, Gordon opined: Adjusting to the bouncy wickets is a huge challenge but, as Steve himself said yesterday, Australia will find it hard to beat India... Sourav and his men must relax and not allow pressure to overwhelm... After all, if theres something over which you have control, its the manner of thinking... While pointing out that India must focus on putting the pressure on Australia, Gordon continued: In any case, the Indians are now much better tourists... Their confidence is more visible. Asked whether he had something specific for Sourav, Gordon replied: Basically, three things... The captain must ensure theres clarity in everybodys role... He should adequately convey he has the confidence in all his players and, finally, must be pro-active and decisive. Gordon is expected to again have sessions with Team India, in Australia. John (Wright) has spoken about it, though details need to be finalised (by the coach)... Its fine with me, but we need to work out mutually convenient dates, he signed off. Perth-based, Gordon started as a physical education teacher in Glasgow and, then, moved to Canada where he took a degree in sport psychology. He did his doctorate there (University of Alberta) as well. Calcutta, by the way, is Gordons last stop before returning home. Chennai, Bangalore, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai and New Delhi were his previous ports of call. Inexplicably, in Mumbai, he only met Hanumant Singh.  Copyright

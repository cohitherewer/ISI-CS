 BCCI refutes Azhar charges
Hyderabad: The BCCI Monday refuted allegations levelled by former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin that he was neither given a clear charge memo nor informed about the exact charges levelled against him before disqualifying him from playing cricket. Making the submissions before the second additional chief judge, civil court here, hearing a suit filed by Azharuddin, the BCCI counsel read out the correspondence entered into by the BCCI and the former captain. The counsel pointed out that all the time Azharuddin had claimed himself to be innocent but never showed any evidence in support of his claim. He also pointed out that replies given by Azharuddin to the queries of the BCCI were similar. (PTI)  Copyright

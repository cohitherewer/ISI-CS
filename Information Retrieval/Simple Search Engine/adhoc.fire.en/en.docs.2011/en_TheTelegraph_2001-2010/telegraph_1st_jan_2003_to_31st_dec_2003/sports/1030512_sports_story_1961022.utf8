The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Constitution amendment on the cards 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) will amend its constitution following recommendations by a Fifa and AFC study report. The report has suggested changes in the national bodys constitution which will be made after discussions with state associations. This was decided at Sundays AIFF task force meeting in Goa. A member of the nine-member task force  which includes the AIFF president and secretary  said constitutions of the state bodies have already been sought. Its not that our constitution doesnt comply with the international guidelines, but certain changes are needed. Like in some of our states, individuals enjoy the right to vote. This has to change, he said. He informed that a four-member committee has already been set up to deal with this. They will go through the constitutions of state units and after that we will recommend changes. Details of the suggestions made by the Fifa-AFC study team, which toured India last year, are awaited. Major changes cannot be ruled out. The task force will submit its first report by July 15 and meet thrice before that, the first meeting coming up in Delhi on June 1. It was learnt that the AIFF has decided to have separate departments looking into infrastructural development, marketing and other important issues.

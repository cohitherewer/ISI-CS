 MCA wants lie-detector test for both parties
 Pune: The Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA)  on Sunday stood by the tainted Abhijit Kale and asked the  two selectors  Kiran More and Pranab Roy  alongwith the  player, to undergo lie-detector tests.  I feel Kale is innocent and he has been denied natural  justice. The only way truth can come out is if both the  selectors and Kale undergo lie-detector tests, acting MCA  chief S.G. Balasaheb Thorve said. Thorve said Kale had been denied justice because he was suspended merely on the basis of allegations levelled by the selectors. We have to get to the bottom of the truth. This is possible only by conducting probe not against Kale alone, but also against Kiran More and Pranab Roy. The MCA official said it was also important to find out whether More was trying to defame the MCA by making Kale a sacrificial goat. He added though the MCA was fully in favour of the BCCI inquiry, itwould continue to lend the player moral support. Asked whether the MCA was providing him any legal assistance, Thorve replied in the negative and said it was up to Kale to decide. He also said that after levelling charges against Kale, the selectors should take initiative in proving them. The onus to prove the allegations now rests on the two selectors. The BCCI on Friday decided to suspend Kale from playing any cricket conducted by it after the two selectors alleged that the player had offered them Rs 10 lakh each for a place in the national side. The BCCI appointed Bar Council of India chairman D.V. Subba Rao as the commissioner of inquiry and asked him to submit the findings within 15 days.  As reported in The Telegraph  on Sunday, the emergent meeting of the BCCI working committee  will be held in New Delhi on November 30 in this regard. Though MCA is not on the working committee, it has been invited to the meeting.  The Indian Cricket Players Association  (ICPA) said Kale deserved better treatment. The ICPA feels  the player deserves a fair hearing and should be well represented,  secretary Arun Lal said. (PTI)  Copyright

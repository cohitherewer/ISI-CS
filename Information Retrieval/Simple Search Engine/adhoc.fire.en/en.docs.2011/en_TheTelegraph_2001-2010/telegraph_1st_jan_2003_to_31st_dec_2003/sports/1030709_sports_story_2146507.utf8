The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA reel under Anderson blows
 James Anderson took four wickets for 38 Birmingham: James Anderson, with four wickets, and Andrew Flintoff, with a spectacular catch to end Jacques Kallis magical run, helped restrict South Africa to 198 for nine in their day-night tri-series encounter with England on Tuesday. England strike bowler Anderson, dispirited by four Graham Smith boundaries in his opening over, returned to claim his first three victims in a nine-ball burst costing one run. But the South Africans gave themselves a chance, Martin van Jaarsveld making 45 in a 71-run stand with tailender Paul Adams (33 not out) after they had slumped to 104 for seven. Banished to the outfield after conceding 24 in his first two overs, Andersons comeback saw him root out Mark Boucher (13), Jacques Rudolph (16) and Shaun Pollock (0) as the home side backed up their bowlers with exemplary catching. South Africa, opting to bat and who had already qualified to meet England in the final, still looked well placed at 99 for four. But Boucher, driving, was caught shin-high at slip by Marcus Trescothick, Rudolph sliced to extra cover and Pollock, also on the front foot and looking for runs, was caught by Flintoff at second slip for a three-ball duck. Anderson finished with four for 38. The key moments, however, belonged to all rounder Flintoff. He, too, had to weather an early shock as Smith clattered his first two balls to the fence. His revenge, though, came with the fifth as Smith, after a bright 39-ball 45, miscued a pull to short square leg where Anthony McGrath spilled the chance to his left before somehow trapping the ball between his legs as he fell.

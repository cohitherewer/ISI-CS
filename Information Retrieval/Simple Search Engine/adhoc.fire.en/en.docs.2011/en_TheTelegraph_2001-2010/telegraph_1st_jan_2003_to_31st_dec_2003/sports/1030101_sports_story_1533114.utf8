		 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Amritraj academy to close shop
																								Chennai: The famous tennis academy in Asia  Britania Amritraj Tennis (BAT) foundation  will be closed down from the coming academic year, mainly due to cost factor.																								The Amritraj brothers, Vijay and Anand, the brain behind the formation of the academy 18 years ago, announced this decision filled with emotions Tuesday.																								Sponsorship of such a massive and long programme is proving to be a near impossibility. Thus the BATs closure has become necessary, Vijay said.																								Vijay said the foundation was founded in 1985 with the primary goal of developing world class tennis players to represent India in the Davis Cup. We have to a great extent achieved the goal of having produced four players during the past 18 years who played for India, he said.																								We have produced a junior Wimbledon in Leander Paes, a couple of Asian junior champions and four Davis Cup players. BAT was the first of its kind in Asia in any sport with live-in facilities. (PTI)

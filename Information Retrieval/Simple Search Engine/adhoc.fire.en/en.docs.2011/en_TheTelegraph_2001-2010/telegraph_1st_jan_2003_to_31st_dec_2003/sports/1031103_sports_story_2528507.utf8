 Dempo, Vasco win
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: Goa clubs Vasco and Dempo coasted to victories in their Durand Cup quarter final league matches Sunday. While Dempo trounced Indian Bank Chennai 3-0 in a group B match, Vasco struggled to beat qualifiers Jammu and Kasmir Bank 1-0. Former Mohun Bagan winger R.C. Prakash and Liberian international Sunday Seah sparkled upfront for Dempo with their speed and quick passing. Coached by former national skipper V.P. Sathyan, Indian Bank offered sporadic resistance. Seah, in his first season for Dempo, scored the opening goal in the 21st minute. Early in the second, former international Prakash struck twice. Midfielder Clifford Mirandas measured flag-kick led to a goalmouth melee and a lurking Prakash flicked in. In the 57th minute, Seah surged past his marker and squared to Prakash, who placed in from close. Vascos Roberto Carlos scored the only goal of the match when Agnello Gomes powerful angular right-footer from the right edge of the box was palmed away by the rival keeper and the Brazilian headed in the rebound. Just before half-time, international K. Ajayans stinging right-footer from outside the box, struck the crosspiece and came back into play.  Md. Sp. sign Rime Meanwhile Mohamemdan Sporting coach Shankar Maitra confirmed that international defender Satish Bharati has recovered from his leg injury and will join the squad Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Black Caps to pursue the Australian  formula
 -India to field unchanged XI 
 McMillan, Tuffey to replace Vincent, Adams FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Shane Bond during  practice in Centurion Thursday. (AP/PTI)  Johannesburg: For India,  the focus is on extending a winning run. For New Zealand,  its starting one. Actually, Fridays Super Six game against  India has near-knockout status for the Black Caps. The Indians have little to gain,  except going for seven wins on-the-trot (the sequence beginning  in Harare last month) and, possibly, having the satisfaction  of knocking New Zealand out of World Cup 2003. For that  to become reality, though, Sourav Ganguly will also have  to bank on Sri Lanka beating Zimbabwe, in East London, Saturday. Given the present equation, the  Black Caps are under no illusion. Yet, they have themselves  to blame. The tournament, after all, could have had a very  different look had New Zealand travelled to Nairobi and  not gifted four points to Kenya. The points allowed Kenya to grow  in strength and, now, Steve Tikolos men are in the semi-finals.  The supreme irony, of course, is that the Black Caps are  struggling to get there. That they thrashed India 5-2,  not too long ago, isnt of any relevance. The Centurion  wicket (described as a belter by Sourav) is vastly different  from what was offered in Auckland or Hamilton. That India  won big (versus Pakistan) in the last outing should also  be a plus. Stephen Fleming, however, is going  back not one but two matches  to the huge defeat suffered  by India at the hands of Australia. Weve been viewing  the tapes, which have confirmed our belief, the captain  informed, indicating that getting Shane Bond to do a Brett  Lee is high on his agenda. Bond himself is cool about the  job that awaits him. I had a good run when we last played  India and, personally, Im seeing the game as an extension  (of the December-January series)... But, yes, quickly getting  the first three is important, the debonair Bond, a one-time  member of the Christchurch police force, told The Telegraph. Predictably, theres much excitement  over the expected Bond-Sachin Tendulkar face-off, but its  unlikely that Indias final Super Six match will be limited  to a battle between two quality performers only. Its significant that the Indians  have begun to perfect the basics and, as long as unforced  errors are at a minimum, extending the winning run shouldnt  be a tall order. As reported in these columns, the XI remains  unchanged. It appears the batting order also wont see an  alteration. Despite having qualified for the  semi-finals, it still is a World Cup game. Therefore, it  must be treated as such. In any case, easing off and allowing  New Zealand to dictate terms can hardly be an ideal preparation  for the March 20 (day-night) round-of-four clash in Durban.  Incidentally, Chris Cairns  in  the headlines thus far for a nightclub brawl only  is likely  to both bat and bowl. And, late Thursday, one learnt the  Black Caps have made two changes from the side which lost  to Australia Tuesday. Craig McMillan, potentially very  dangerous, is back in place of Lou Vincent, while Daryl  Tuffey (who was successful in the last India series) has  taken Andre Adams berth. As with everything that Fleming  does, the inclusions/exclusions must have been planned with  care. Soon, we will know to what extent  the tinkering was successful.

 Miandad blames India connection 
Karachi: Pakistan coach Javed Miandad said there would not have been the same controversy had Wasim Akram been offered a coaching assignment by any other country other than India. People in this country are very emotional about ties with India and with the Indians coming to Pakistan next year, obviously they were not willing to accept Akram as a bowling coach for them, he said. Meanwhile, Akram released a statement through his wife that he had never considered a coaching job with the Indian team.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Upbeat Kumble ready for the challenge
 Durban: Far from denting his confidence, his recent lean patch has only strengthened Anil Kumbles resolve to do better and the leg-spinner is upbeat about his performance in the World Cup. Kumble has had a very lean season last year. He claimed just 19 wickets from 20 one-day Internationals last year at an average of 46.31. However, he did much better in the 10 Test matches, taking 49 wickets at an average of 27.67. However, the bowler sought to dispel all doubts that he was past his prime and might be considering retirement. I am feeling upbeat and everything is going well, Kumble said here Tuesday. I will continue at the international level as long as I am in good nick, he said. Kumble said spin bowling would be the key to Indias success in the Cup. Together with Harbhajan Singh, I aim to ensure that we grab as many wickets as possible. The tournament is going to be challenging but we are confident of doing well.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Imran kicks off cricket clinic
Karachi: Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan said Wednesday he will coach young blood to lift national cricket and urged the country to follow Australias shining example. After Pakistans disappointing performance in the World Cup, a lot of my friends asked me to help Pakistan cricket and despite my commitments in politics I have agreed to help with coaching, Imran said speaking at a launch of regional cricket clinics. I want to pay back what this country has given me, said Imran, a Pakistani MP who leads the movement for justice party. Pakistan failed to go beyond the first round in the World Cup. In a massive overhaul, Pakistan dumped eight senior players  including captain Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar and Inzamam-ul Haq. Pakistan has a lot of talent but we need to harness that talent like they do in Australia, which has enabled them to rule the cricket world, said Imran, whose 362 wickets in 88 Tests and 182 in 175 one-dayers made him a leading fast bowler in the 1970s and 1980s. A player in Australia is ready for international cricket once he comes out of their academies and first class competitions, which is not there in our part of the world, said the all-rounder who led Pakistan to their only World Cup title in Australia in 1992. The coaching clinics, conducted under the auspices of the Pakistan Cricket Board will be held at more than a dozen venues. Cricket is so very much popular in Pakistan that every boy wants to don the green cap but you need to work hard, he said. PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said a new first-class structure was among the many steps taken by the board to improve Pakistani cricket. It is nice to have a person like Imran Khans stature on board, and through these regional clinics and competitive first class competitions we will set a strong foundation, said Raja, himself a former captain. Pakistan hold two major domestic first class tournaments, which are dominated by sponsored teams not cities.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Top athletes tested positive: IOA
New Delhi, April 5 (PTI): Des-pite claims by the governme-nt and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) of having ridden Indian sports of drug m-enace, a number of top athle-tes tested positive for ba-nned drugs during the National Games in Hyderabad last year. Though officials are not disclosing any details, over a dozen athletes from at least three disciplines were believed to have tested positive during the December 13 to 22 Games, which the organisers trumpeted as being dope free. The stunning disclosure comes on top of the drug fiasco involving two weightlifters at the Manchester Commonwealth Games last year. Admitting the news, IOA secretary general Randhir Singh, said: The IOA had received a list from its medical commission containing the names of athletes who tested positive at the Games. Amateur Athletic Federation of India (AAFI) secretary Lalit Bhanot said those whose A sample tested positive were grilled by a commission. Stating that the AAFI got the report from the IOA almost a month back, he said: The procedures that follow after A samples turn positive are now over. And we are in the process of compiling the final report. He, however, declined to disclose the number of athletes who tested positive.  Copyright

				 																																	Beijing: The year 2002 was a good one for Chinese athletes who set a total of 29 world records and won 110 world champion titles during the period. Chinese athletes not only maintained their dominance in the continent, finishing top in the Asian Games medal tally for a sixth straight time in Busan, they also extended their winning streak to the Winter Olympics bagging the first-ever gold medal to score a historic breakthrough.				 																																	Among the outstanding achievements by the Chinese in 2002 were the world records set by 17 athletes and five teams, including seven records in Olympic events. Of these records, 17 were set in weightlifting, eight in shooting, two in short-course swimming, and one each in cycling and under-water swimming.				 																																	Chinese won 110 world titles in world championships and world cup meets last year. Of the titles, 42 were won in Olympic events, which represented 38 per cent of the total titles won.				 																																	Indore: Hiralal Gaekwad, a former Test cricketer and pillar of the erstwhile Holkar cricket team, died in Bagdogra on Wednesday after a protracted illness, family sources said on Thursday. He was 82.				 																																	He represented India in just one Test in 1952 against England. The left-arm medium pacer played 66 Ranji matches and took 278 wickets while playing for Madhya Bharat and Madhya Pradesh, and scored 1960 runs in 95 innings. In first-class cricket he scored 2487 runs and took 375 wickets. 				 																																	Hyderabad: The first national sub-junior super league chess championship with a prize money of Rs 1 lakh begins here on Friday and will end on January 9. Top performers will get an opportunity to represent India in the world youth chess Olympiad 2003. National sub-junior champions G. Rohit and Vinuthna head the boys and girls sections, respectively. Each section has 14 players each and the tournament will be played on a round-robin basis, organising secretary S. Vijayasarathi said.

Manchester: Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson has set David Beckham the target of scoring ten goals a season after watching the England captain claim his second in two games in the New Years Day win over Sunderland.				 																																	David should be getting 10 goals a season for us, Ferguson told reporters after the match. It is a part of his game he should be adding to because he is a good goal scorer.				 																																	When he came back after a little rest last season he started to score goals and though he was unfortunate with his rib injury this year, there is a great freshness about him. Overall, he turned in a tremendous performance yesterday (Wednesday).

 Lanka win on Dilshan blitz
 - Murali takes three for 16; Hosts miss out on a valuable bonus point  Prabath Nissanka in action in Dambulla Tuesday. He claimed two key wickets  Stephen Fleming and Scott Styris  for 11 runs. (AFP) Dambulla: Tillekeratne Dilshan smacked four boundaries in an over to give Sri Lanka a five-wicket victory over New Zealand on Tuesday. Set only 140 to win in the third match of the series, Sri Lanka were at 120 for five. But with 18 runs needed from the last 24 balls, Dilshan struck four boundaries as they won with 14 balls to spare. New Zealand and Pakistan head the table with six points followed by Sri Lanka on five. The New Zealanders made 139 runs from 43.4 overs with Muttiah Muralidharan taking three for 16 from 8.1 overs. Prabath Nissanka took two for 11 from five overs with the new ball. New Zealand, who lost the toss, slumped to 18 for three in the sixth over. Number three batsman Lou Vincent top scored with 32 from 72 balls hitting two boundaries. Vincent shared a 48-run stand for the fifth wicket with Jacob Oram (20). Muralidharan eventually broke through as Oram popped back a return catch and Sri Lanka wrapped up the innings with the last six wickets falling for 45 runs. Opener Romesh Kaluwitharana top scored for Sri Lanka with 48 from 119 balls, including four fours. He put on 68 for the first wicket with Sanath Jayasuriya, who made 33. After Oram dismissed Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara, Kaluwitharana added 47 runs with skipper Maravan Atapattu. Oram struck again, dismissing Kaluwitharana and Atapattu in quick succession, before Daryl Tuffey had Mahela Jayawardene caught behind. Dilshan then came to the rescue although Sri Lanka missed out on a valuable bonus point by failing to win within 36.4 overs. The match was reduced to 46 overs after a morning drizzle. The final four matches of the tournament have been shifted to Dambulla after the early arrival of the southwest monsoon in Colombo.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

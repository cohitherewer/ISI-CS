 Chandigarh champions
Srinagar: Chandigrah won the 49th C.K. Nayadu under-19 meet, beating Gujarat at the Sher-e-Kashmir International Stadium here on Friday. Chandigarh, opting to bat first, rode Gurkilat Singhs 40 to 173 in 39.1 overs. Alkesh was Gujarats best bowler (three for 44). Gujarat began disastrously, losing Rahul for three. Sheldon and Omer Babi steadied the innings with 25 and 23, respectively, and Alkesh chipped in with 28, but Gujarat were all out for 136 in the 37th over. Gaurav Gambhir and Naresh took three wickets each for Chandigarh.  (PTI)  Copyright

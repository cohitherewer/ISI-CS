		 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 India exposed in NZ: Hudson
																								Durban: Belittling Indias chances at the World Cup former South African opener Andrew Hudson has said the New Zealand tour had exposed Sourav Gangulys team, and predicted a South Africa-Australia final.																								Until recently, I gave India a chance of making the last four, but the New Zealand tour has exposed them. I also gave England a thought, but I think they too will struggle in our conditions, Hudson said on Sunday.																								Hudson predicted that South Africa, Australia, Pakistan and New Zealand would make it to the final four with the final being an Australia-South Africa affair. Hudson, however, cautioned South Africa against over optimism. Historically, this tournament has not favoured the home side, and the same could be this time around.  (PTI)

 Akram quits Hants
 Akram took the decision due to ill health London: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has quit Hampshire because of ill health, the County side said on Tuesday. The 37-year-old allrounder took the decision on the advice of his doctors, the club said. Wasim, who is a known diabetic, has suffered ill health in the past few months and is very sad to be leaving, Hampshire said in a statement. Akram signed a one-year deal with Hampshire in April as a replacement for Shane Warne after the Australian leg-spinner was suspended in February for 12 months after testing positive for banned diuretics. He played in five of Hampshires eight championship matches this season, taking 20 wickets at an average of 25.15. Wasim has proved to be a very valuable and popular member of the team and we are very sorry to be losing him at this stage of the season, said Hampshires director of cricket Tim Tremlett. Wasim, who had a 10-year spell in English cricket with Lancashire from 1988 to 1998, announced his international retirement in May.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

				 																																	Paris: Zinedine Zidane returns to the France squad for their international friendly against Switzerland next week after missing out on the Confederations Cup due to club commitments with Real Madrid. His Real teammate, Claude Makelele also joins up with the same squad that won the Confederations Cup.				 																																	Well need to be at full strength because this match will be a good test for our next Euro 2004 qualifying games, France coach Jacques Santini said while announcing his 20-man squad on Wednesday. 				 																																	European champions France are five points clear at the top of group I with three matches remaining against Cyprus, on September 6 in Paris, Slovenia, on September 10 in Ljubljana, and Israel, on October 11 in Paris.				 																																	London: Twice Olympic 1,500m champion Sebastian Coe and leading athletes agent Jos Hermens will stand for election next week for the IAAF governing council. Elections for the 27-member council will be held next Wednesday on the first day of a two-day IAAF congress in Paris before the world championships start the following Saturday.				 																																	Coe was an Olympic gold medallist in 1980 and 1984. Dutchman Hermens, a former world record holder for the hour run, manages several prominent athletes including Ethiopias Olympic 10,000m champion Haile Gebrselassie. 				 																																	Munich: German champions Bayern Munich said they would not be taking action against Deportivo La Coruna over the protracted transfer of striker Roy Makaay as the Dutchman was officially presented at the Bavarian club Wednesday.

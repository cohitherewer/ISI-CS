The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Had to look after teams interest
 - Laxman ranks knocks in Mohali with the quot;very best quot;
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  V.V. S. Laxman with the Man of the Series award in Mohali on Monday. (PTI) Chandigarh: V.V.S. Laxman, who posted two superb knocks in the Mohali Test, ranks his unbeaten 104 and 67 with the very best he has ever played. Laxman, of course, holds the record for the highest Indian Test score  281. The runs came at critical moments in both innings Given the position we were in, each one of them will definitely rank with my very best efforts, Laxman told The Telegraph. Speaking soon after being adjudged Man of the Series, he added: I had to look after the teams interest and, looking back, Im happy I could do whatever was asked of me Talking of the conditions, Laxman said: The wicket had begun to deteriorate from the fourth afternoon itself and, so, one had to be particularly careful against Daniel Vettori I did begin with a series of strokes but, then, had to adjust according to the situation we found ourselves in. Laxman, incidentally, had high praise for Akash Chopra who was a terrific comrade-in-arms on the last afternoon. According to him, Akash has an excellent temperament and very good technique. In other words, the opener has it in him to be a stayer. Now that the Test series is over, Laxman has begun focussing on the ODIs. Its always nice to begin the (international) season with some runs Ill be a more confident player after the knocks in Mohali, he pointed out. The October 23 match in Chennai  versus New Zealand  will mark Laxmans comeback to limited-overs cricket.  Copyright

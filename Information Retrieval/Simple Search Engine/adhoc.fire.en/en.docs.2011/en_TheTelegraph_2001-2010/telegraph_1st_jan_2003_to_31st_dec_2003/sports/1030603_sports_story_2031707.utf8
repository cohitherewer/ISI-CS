The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I followed the rule book: Vishy
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Gundappa Viswanath Calcutta: With the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) not formally making too big an issue of Shoaib Akhtars punishment for ball-tampering, a controversy which could have affected ties with India has been averted.Its possible that either a less mature response, from the PCB, or a myopic reaction in the Pakistan Media  highlighting Match Referee Clive Lloyds leniency on the issue not very long ago  would have hurt efforts to restore bilateral exchanges. That exercise, in any case, is at a critical stage. The two ODIs ban, after all, was slapped by Gundappa Viswanath, Indias sole representative on the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) Elite Panel of Match Referees.Having said that, however, nothing should be read into the PCBs assertion that it wasnt challenging the punishment. Fact is, a Match Referees ruling on Level 1 and 2 offences cant be appealed. Vishy, its to be noted, booked Shoaib for a Level 2 misdemeanour.[Under the ICCs Rules of Conduct, only punishments handed out for Level 3 and 4 offences can be challenged. Both, obviously, carry much stiffer penalties: A Level 4 misdemeanour may even result in a life ban.]Vishy, a former captain, himself remains unfazed. Quite typical that.I followed the rule book, thats it At no time did I think my decision would spark a controversy. Rather, I did what was expected of me as Match Referee  nothing more, nothing less, he told The Telegraph Monday, when contacted at his Bangalore residence.The Rules of Conduct forbid Match Referees from commenting once their pronouncement has been made and, so, Vishy declined to speak at length.Yet, he did say: I have, in the past, officiated in a series/tournament featuring Pakistan and will again be Match Referee in England later this month (for the three-match NatWest Challenge) As with other Match Referees, Im the ICCs man-on-the-spot and the question of nationality shouldnt ariseExactly four years ago, of course, another former India captain  Srinivas Venkatraghavan  had a different view in the context of a slightly different role.Venkat, it may be recalled, had the chance of standing in the (1999) World Cup final but let it be known that he wouldnt be interested if Pakistan made the title-round.He had his reasons: The Kargil War toll had begun to mount and, given the state of Indo-Pak relations, Venkat didnt wish to risk being dragged into any controversy.As it turned out, Pakistan did make the final and with Venkat unavailable, David Shepherd and Steve Bucknor got on-field postings. Ram Babu Gupta, therefore, remains the only Indian to have officiated in a World Cup  Copyright

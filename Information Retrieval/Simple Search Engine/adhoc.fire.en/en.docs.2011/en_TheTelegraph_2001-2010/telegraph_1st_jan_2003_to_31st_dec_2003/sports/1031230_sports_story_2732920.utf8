 Baggios plans 
Rome: Former World Player of the Year Roberto Baggio says he plans to retire at the end of the current season. Thats my idea right now and unless theres some incredible U-turn, I dont believe Im going to change my mind, Baggio, 36, told television programme Teletutto on Monday. The former Italy striker, known as The Divine Ponytail due to his hairstyle and Buddhist beliefs, has had a career blighted by injury. He has had a number of knee operations and a back problem has limited his appearances for his Serie A side Brescia this season. Theyve plagued me and given me a rough ride over the years, he said.These days, at my age, it gets rougher and rougher. Asked what he hoped to do after hanging up his boots, Baggio said: Its too soon to say. Ive still got to get used to the idea of not being out there on the pitch, running.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its been an emotional afternoon, says Chopra
 - Delhi opener needs idol Athertons qualities to flourish at the highest level  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Rajkot, Oct.4: Three weeks ago, Akash Chopra wasnt sure where he stood. Of course, he had recovered from surgery on the right knee, but didnt quite know when would be his next chance to press for a Team India berth. The season launching Cha-llenger Trophy, after all, had come and gone... Thats when the national selectors decided to give the Delhi opener not one but two opportunities before the start of Team Indias 2003-2004 commitments: The right-handed Akash was picked for both the Board Presidents XI and India A. Today, after scores of an unbeaten 103 and 66 against New Zealand, he earned his first big-time call-up. That Akash was set to make the XIV for the Ahme dabad Test was reported by The Telegraph yesterday. On learning of my selection, I thanked God and, then, thought of my parents (Shyam Lal and Shashi)... Its been an emotional afternoon, Akash remarked, speaking exclusively on conclusion of the India A-New Zealand game. So, come Wednesday and he will be making his Test debut. Predictably, the excitement has already taken root. Oh, thats the ultimate... The biggest challenge... In fact, Ill be judged only on how I perform in that match... Now onwards, that unbeaten hundred in Vizag and the 66 here wont matter, Akash said. His opening partner, incidentally, will be state-mate Virender Sehwag. Acknowledging that consolidating his position would be tougher than having got there, Akash continued: Staying at the top is the more difficult bit... But, then, Im neither short on confidence nor determination... Its in my hands to make the most of this break... Akash, who turned 26 last month, was chosen unanimously. However, there was some discussion about the merits of Sadagopan Ramesh (who scored 110 in India As only innings) and Sanjay Bangar. In a nice gesture, Ramesh  out of favour for two years  warmly congratulated Akash. For his part, the Delhiite labelled Ramesh a fluent player. Both featured in that 164-run partnership yesterday, putting India A on the road to taking a lead in the three-dayer which ended today. Given that the business part of his career is merely days away, its just as well Akash idolises former England opener (and captain) Michael Atherton. Indeed, he will need Athertons qualities to survive  and flourish  at the highest level. We wish him well.  Copyright

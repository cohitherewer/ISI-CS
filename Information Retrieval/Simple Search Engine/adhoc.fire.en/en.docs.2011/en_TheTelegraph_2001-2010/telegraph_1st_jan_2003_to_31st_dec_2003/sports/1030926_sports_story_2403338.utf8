 Duleep Trophy after Aussie tour
Calcutta: Faced with criticism over the non-participation of international cricketers in domestic meets, the BCCI has decided to hold the Duleep Trophy only after Team India returns from their tour Down Under. It has been recommended that the Duleep Trophy this season should be played only when the international cricketers are available, BCCI sources said on Thursday. The Ranji Trophy schedule has also been fixed to ensure that the stars play the semi-finals and the final.  BCCI dips into red The BCCI has registered a deficit of Rs 2.36 crore during 2002-03 compared to a surplus of Rs 29.71 crore for the previous year. The deficit occurred due to a 14.23 per cent drop in income and a 35 per cent jump in expenditure during 2002-03. The total earnings of the board declined to Rs 73.15 crore in 2002-03 from an income of Rs 85.30 crore in 2001-02. (PTI)  Copyright

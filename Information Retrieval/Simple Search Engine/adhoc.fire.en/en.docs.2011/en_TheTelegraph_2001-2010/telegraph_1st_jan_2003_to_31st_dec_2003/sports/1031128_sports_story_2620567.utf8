The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dum Dum school out
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: Dum Dum Kumar Ashutosh Institute crashed out of the Subroto Mukerjee Cup losing to Government High School, Dimapur, 2-3 in a Group IV league match on Thursday. Luck favoured the Nagaland school as Kumar Ashutosh boys missed a number of sitters and surrendered the lead twice. Also, with Saraswati Senior Secondary school, Rohtak, withdrawing, the Nagaland school has nine points and are set to make the knock-out stage. The Dumdum schools concluding game against Sainik School, Imphal, on Friday also becomes inconsequential, as only one team from each group makes the quarter finals.  Copyright

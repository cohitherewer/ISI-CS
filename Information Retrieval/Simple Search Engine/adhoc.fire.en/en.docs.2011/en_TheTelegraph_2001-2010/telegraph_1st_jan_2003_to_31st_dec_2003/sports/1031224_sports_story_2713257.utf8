The Telegraph - Calcutta
 JCT hold Vasco
Ludhiana: JCT and Vasco bagged a point each after their sixth round National Football League match ended in a goalless draw on Tuesday. Vasco were without star Brazilian midfielder Edson, who missed the match due to a red card he had got during his sides 0-2 loss against Mohan Bagan in Calcutta on December 18. JCT, however, failed to take advantage of Edsons absence, as they followed a defensive ploy from the beginning. JCT now have eight points from six matches, while Vasco have seven from six.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mauled Indians look to relaunch campaign
Sourav amp; Co. to choose from Nehra and Kumble
 It's the form on the day, says Geoff Marsh  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Henry Olonga and Heath Streak during a practice session in Harare Tuesday Harare: It was that incomprehensible defeat at the hands of Zimbabwe, in Leicester, which effectively derailed Indias 1999 World Cup campaign. This time, a win against them will put our 2003 challenge back on track.Late Tuesday, it was learnt that Harbhajan Singh is certain to figure in the XI if just one spinner is picked. The toss-up, then, is between Ashish Nehra and Anil Kumble. Conditions will determine who will play.
Traditionally, Zimbabwe take to an India match as underdogs. On Wednesday, however, they will be starting as equals (at the Harare Sports Club). Of course, a number of reasons have improved the home teams pre-game standing: The Indians lack of form, the home advantage and eight points (four by default, off England) in the kitty.After being smashed by Australia, the Indians will actually be relaunching their Pool A campaign here. We are aware of the importance of the day...Weve got to apply ourselves and put runs on the board...Its a testing period and how we come out of it will reveal our character, pointed out Indian captain Sourav Ganguly.Opposite number Heath Streak, though, isnt short on confidence. Were backing ourselves to pull off a victory...If successful, we will have an excellent chance of qualifying for the Super Six. That, for now, is our priority, he emphasised.Yet, as coach Geoff Marsh told The Telegraph, Its the form on the day which matters most and the past doesnt have much relevance. In other words, Zimbabwe arent comforting themselves too much by the Indians recent performances.Just as well because, potentially, the most explosive opening pair will be on view from Indias side  Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag. Only, one hopes this arrangement, whereby Sourav will bat at No.4, doesnt become bonus ammunition for the captains critics.A couple of options (Sehwag and Dinesh Mongia, for example) were considered for the very top but, eventually, a call from a senior Board functionary made Sourav decide to come down himself. Apparently, back home, nobody wants Sachin to be disturbed. At the same time, everybody wants an opening slot returned to Sehwag.Obviously, so many demands arent making Souravs job any easy. But, then, till he himself gets back among the runs  his last innings of any significance was the 53 in Vadodara, three months ago  he will find his freedom curbed. Its not a happy situation, but its in Souravs own hands to get out of this corner.Well have to play in overdrive...Theres no choice, is how Sourav summed up Team Indias requirement. Streak too was candid in acknowledging: We will have to make things happen... We cant sit back and expect India to gift us wickets...The past year has seen the teams meet each other six times and the scoreline is 4-2 in Indias favour. However, the five-match series (in India) was as close as the result (3-2), while Zimbabwe were extremely well-placed in last Septembers Champions Trophy till Mohammed Kaif (an unbeaten 111) and vice-captain Rahul Dravid (71) rescued India from a pitiable five down for 87.For Kaif, its now a do-or-die game.The contest has been keen and gone are the days when Zimbabweans were overawed by the more experienced opposition. Tuesdays The Herald even had a cocky quote from quick Douglas Hondo: I have respect for this Indian team, but that respect wont be there once we take the field. Everyone plays to win.More than anything else, thats a reflection of the home sides confidence. In any case, Hondo has scripted excellent performances versus India. A few hours from now, he will get another chance to improve his record. Or, will Sachin (who missed that 1999 match owing to his fathers death) let him know just who is boss?Its a teasing wait.Its no secret, by the way, that Zimbabwes accent will be on pace and, while retaining the XI which thrashed Namibia, they have named Andy Blignaut in the XII. Its almost certain that Blignaut, who troubled India on their last visit (summer of 2001) will play, but it couldnt be confirmed as to who will have to make way.Though the selectors have omitted the hugely experienced Alistair Campbell, Andy Flower is very much there, as is Craig Wishart who posted a superb unbeaten 172 against Namibia. Andy, in fact, will be making his last appearance at the Harare SC  Zimbabwes remaining games are all in Bulawayo.Black armband or not, Andy is bound to be seeking to say farewell with one more knock of consequence versus India. As it is, his record is phenomenal.As it rained late on Monday and was overcast for much of Tuesday, the Indians are strongly considering giving speedster Ashish Nehra his maiden World Cup cap. However, for him to come in, one of the spinners (Anil Kumble or Harbhajan Singh) will have to be dropped.Nehra, it may be recalled, did well at the Harare SC on the 2001 tour and, currently, has the support of both Sourav and coach John Wright. The wicket is expected to offer juice and, so, fielding him shouldnt be a bad idea.Incidentally, if the elements continue to come into calculations, then the toss will become more crucial that it would otherwise have been.TEAMSINDIA (likely): Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Dinesh Mongia, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Harbhajan Singh, Ashish Nehra/Anil Kumble, Jawagal Srinath and Zaheer Khan.ZIMBABWE (from): Craig Wishart, Mark Vermeulen, Andy Flower, Grant Flower, Dion Ebrahim, Guy Whittal, Tatenda Taibu, Heath Streak, Bryan Murphy, Douglas Hondo, Henry Olonga and Andy Blignaut.Umpires: Rudi Koertzen (SA), Asoka de Silva (SL).Match Referee: Clive Lloyd (WI).Match starts: 1.00 pm  Copyright

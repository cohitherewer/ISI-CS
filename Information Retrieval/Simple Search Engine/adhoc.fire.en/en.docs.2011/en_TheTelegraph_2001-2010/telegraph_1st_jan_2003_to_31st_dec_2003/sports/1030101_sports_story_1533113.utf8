The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, January 01, 2003  Strength may outsprint all in star event 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: It is festive time again at the RCTC raceground on New Years Day. An eight event card, that includes sponsored events like the Eveready Alkaline Sprinters Trophy and the Eveready Indian Produce Stakes, also has a touch of royalty, thanks to His Majesty the king of Nepal who has donated the Nepal Gold Cup, an annual feature on January 1. All three events, however, bear a very open outlook.				 										The sprint event may see clash of titans  Bold Chieftan and Strengthtostrength  the two very high handicapped horses in the countrys turf circuit. However, both are past their prime, though until last winter they reigned supreme.				 										However, the fact that Strengthtostrength has, in his two mock-trials here, been showing glimpse of his form that helped the eight-year-old claim a rare double of wins  the Sprinters Cup and the Super Mile  during the Invitational weekend last March, the Farajullah-Powerglide from John Stephens yard may just about beat Bold Chieftan to annex the sprinters crown in the hands of Robert Gowli. 				 										Andropov in the Produce Stakes faces no serious threat from the rival quarters. It is his vastly improved stable-mate, Thrilling Proposal, who may pose problem to the Vijay Singh-trainee who moved luxuriously in the last furlong to score a runaway victory. The Proposal had placed third, albeit far behind in the race.				 										Hello Brother, who had outclassed Andreyev in Mysore, may do so again if the six-year-old manages to produce a repeat performance in the Nepal Gold Cup. Although it was only about 10 days ago that the Young Senor-One Up son ran, that run is best ignored as he needed the lung opener. Chowksey Ruzaan partners the Farley Rodrigues-trained gelding.				 										Royal Command shapes as a good bet in the Winged Tiger Handicap for three-year-old and over in Class V to be run over a 1,100m scurry. The Excaliburs Lake-Bruno Conti son has attained fitness after running forward races against stiff opposition.

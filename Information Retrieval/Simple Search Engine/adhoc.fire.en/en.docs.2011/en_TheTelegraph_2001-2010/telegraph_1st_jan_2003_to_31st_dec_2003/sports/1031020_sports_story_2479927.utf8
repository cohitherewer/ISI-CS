 Barua back on top 
 - JAMSHEDPUR CHESS - Surya shares third spot  Dibyendu Barua Jamshedpur: Commonwealth champion Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua regained sole lead with a thumping victory over GM Marat Dzhumaev of Uzbekistan in the 10th and penultimate round of the Tata International Open chess tournament at the J.R.D. Tata sports complex here on Sunday. Barua took his tally to 8.5 points after scoring his seventh victory in the tournament and needs only a draw in Mondays final round to annex the title. Close on Baruas heels are GMs Saidali Iuldashev of Uzbekistan and Alexander Fominyh of Russia with 8 points. Seven others  IM Tahir Vakhidov of Uzbekistan, GM Sergei Ovsejevitsch of Ukraine, GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly, R.B. Ramesh, Deep Sengupta, Valay Parikh and Dzhumaev  shared the third spot on 7.5 points. Barua was at his attacking best. Playing black, Dzhumaev was up against a positional approach in the opening phase in the modern defence but soon Barua went for the king. A sacrifice to remove an important defender by Barua proved to be the knock out punch as Dzhumaev failed to tackle the rampaging white forces. The game lasted nearly four hours. Towards the end, Parikh sprang a surprise on sub-continents first Grandmaster, Niaz Murshed of Bangladesh. Parikh was a picture of confidence in this important game as he assured himself his maiden International Master norm. Local talent Sengupta produced another good result when he held Ganguly to a draw in a Ruy Lopez game. Ganguly tried to make inroads in the ensuing rooks and minor piece endgame but Sengupta was up to the task after choosing the exchange variation.  (PTI)  Copyright

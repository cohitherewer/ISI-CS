The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kenya wary of upbeat Canada
Cape Town: Canada skipper Joe Harris believes the pressure is on Kenya to beat them in the World Cup group B match at Newlands Saturday. We feel confident going into the game, the 37-year-old captain said. The pressure is on them to beat us. People dont expect us to win games here. But once you win the first game, expectations naturally increase. Canada scored a surprise victory against Bangladesh in their tournament opener Wednesday. Harris said it was crucial to win against the Kenyans too. It made the front pages of all the major newspapers, he said. Its big news and theyre paying attention to us at home. Our crickets getting the necessary exposure it requires and another win will give tremendous boost to the game in Canada. Still smarting from the 10-wicket loss against South Africa, Kenya remain wary about the Canadians. However, skipper Steve Tikolo said his side was looking forward to the game. What we lacked against the South Africans was the proper execution of plans, Tikolo said. This is a very big game for us and we cant take them lightly anymore. If you drop your guard you could be in for a lot of embarrassment. (AP)  Copyright

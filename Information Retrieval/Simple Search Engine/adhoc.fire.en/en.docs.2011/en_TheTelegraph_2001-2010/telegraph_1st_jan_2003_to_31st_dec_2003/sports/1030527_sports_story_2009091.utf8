 Badani on comeback trail
 Badani has eyes set on the Indian team New Delhi: A superb century in the Ranji Trophy final ensured a place in the India A side, but Hemang Badani feels his comeback is incomplete until he makes his way back into the senior national team. Getting selected for India A is a good feeling but I have my eyes set on the Indian team, Badani said Monday. The Tamil Nadu batsman, who has been in wilderness since a home one-day International against Zimbabwe in 2002, scored a fighting fifth-day hundred in a losing cause against Mumbai in the Ranji final at the Wankhede Stadium earlier this month. For India As tour of England in June-July, Badani will be the deputy to captain Shiv Sundar Das. Badani, who had played four Tests and 29 ODIs in his brief two-year international career, feels the different weather and pitch conditions in England would test the mettle of any player. Although we are touring in summer, England is a lot colder and playing on different pitches is going to be a difficult task. We have to play good cricket, and whoever does well will be worthy of a place in the Indian team, said Badani, who has played in England twice at various levels before. The Indian team will be playing two four-day matches, five three-dayers and four one-dayers in England. Badani, however, said he has no personal goals while playing such quality opposition. We are going to play lot of cricket in less than 40 days. There is no room for personal goals in such situations. Our priority would be to win as many matches as possible because the countrys pride is at stake. The personal part will take care of itself, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sporting talk tough
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will issue a stern warning to some of their senior players for indiscipline and unsatisfactory results in the last few tournaments. It was decided in a meeting of the club officials, coach Sankar Maitra and technical advisor P.K. Banerjee that if the players do not attend practice regularly, they will be fined. This includes senior players like Dipendu Biswas and Hussain Mustafi, a Mohammedan Sporting official preferring anonymity told The Telegraph on Sunday. Well watch them for a couple of days more. If their attitude doesnt change, we may also suspend them and ask the IFA to take action against them. The club is also likely to release their goalkeeping coach Naseer Ahmed following difference of opinion with the officials. We can do without a goalkeeping coach, the official added. The club officials are also not too happy with PK, who hasnt accompanied the team to tournaments like the Airlines Cup and the Durand Cup, where the black-and-white brigade performed miserably. Weve made it clear to him that he has to be with the team when we play our away matches in the National Football League, the official added. However, he said that the TA has promised he will be with the team during these matches. Well see for the first ten games of the NFL whether he keeps his words, the official added. Ever-Ready in final Ever-Ready have made it to the final of the Lumding invitational meet beating Orissa Sporst Academy 3-0 in the semi-final on Sunday. According to information received here, Eugene Grey, Ernest Jeremiah and Satyajit Bose scored.  Copyright

 Paes-Rikl in title round
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 12: Leander Paes and David Rikl are on a roll. The top seeds notched up another crushing win to enter the final of the Swiss Open in Gstaad. According to information received here, Paes and Rikl dismissed Czech duo Petr Pala and Pavel Vizner 6-2, 6-1 in the semi-final of the claycourt event Friday. This was their third successive straight-set triumph this week. In Sundays final, Paes and Rikl will clash with the winners of the all-Czech Jiri Novak-Radek Stepanek versus Frantisek Cermak-Leos Friedl clash. Paes and Rikl had beaten the Argentina-Brazil combine of Sebastian Prieto and Andre Sa 6-2, 6-3 in the quarter finals. Besides making the semis of the French Open and Wimbledon, Paes and Rikl have won the Delray Beach title this year and been runner-up (to Roger Federer and Max Mirnyi) at the Miami Masters.

 Pollock: Smith has my support
 Shaun Pollock Dhaka: Shaun Pollock has no regrets with losing his job as the South African captain after a disastrous World Cup campaign and is determined to play his part in the rebuilding the side.I dont think I will look back in regret. I am proud of what I achieved as captain. Now I have to move forward and play my part in the rebuilding process Pollock said on Tuesday. After the World Cup, the team-man that he is, Pollock has no problems playing under the 22-year-old Graeme Smith, the youngest-ever South African skipper. You have to let Graeme get on with the job and find his feet. He needs the support from all the seniors, he said.I wont say anything to him at this stage, I want him to do it in his style. Let him settle down.Pollock, who has an impressive track record as captain, said the new team management has thought of a different role for him and may even contemplate elevating him in the batting as the pinch hitter. Obviously as a senior player, I will try to give as much support to Graeme as possible. I have to try and perform and take as many wickets as I can. Graeme feels I should bowl first change. Since I am not used to doing that, I am trying to learn.There has also been some talk of moving me up the batting order, Pollock said.  Copyright

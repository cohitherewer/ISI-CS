 Bashar leads fightback

(Reuters) Karachi: Habibul Bashar hit his second half century of the Test match against Pakistan to leave Bangladesh on an even footing at stumps on Day III at the National Stadium on Friday. Bangladesh, seeking their first Test match win, were 163 for three with Bashar unbeaten on 82 and Razin Saleh on 27. The pair added an invaluable 80 runs for the fourth wicket, giving Bangladesh a lead of 105 runs and a realistic chance of setting the home team a challenging target. Earlier, Pakistan were dismissed for 346, taking a 58-run first innings lead. Bashar, who made 71 in the first innings, left Pakistans new-look attack look mediocre during his resilient 228-minute knock, which included seven boundaries. Bangladesh again had a shaky start when opener Javed Omar was trapped leg-before by Shoaib Akhtar for 13. Bashar found an able ally in opener Hanan Sarkar as Bangladesh erased Pakistans lead during their second-wicket stand of 54. After Sarkar (30) got out, Bashar continued the fightback with a solid unbroken 80-run stand with debutant Saleh. Earlier, Pakistan, resuming at 301 for five, lost their last five wickets for just 45 runs.  (PTI)  Copyright

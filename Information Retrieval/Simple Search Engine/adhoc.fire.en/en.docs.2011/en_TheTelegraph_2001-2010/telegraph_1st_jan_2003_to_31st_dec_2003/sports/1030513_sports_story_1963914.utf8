 India finish fourth
New Delhi: Indias campaign in the Fed Cup junior tennis tournaments Asia-Oceania zonal qualification tie in Kuala Lumpur stuttered on the final day when they went down to Chinese Taipei 1-2 to finish fourth overall. In the third-fourth position play-off match on Sunday, Sanaa Bhambri won the opening singles match 6-2, 6-1 against Yu-Ting Lin but Tara Iyer was tamed 1-6, 1-6 by Wen-Hsin Hsu. Sanaa and Kartiki Bhat lost the doubles tie to Lin and Hsu 2-6, 5-7, according to information reaching here. Indias creditable performance might be gauged from the fact that the team they beat in the group stages, Japan, went on to win the title beating Thailand in the final. Thailand defeated India 2-1 in the semi-finals.  (PTI)  Copyright

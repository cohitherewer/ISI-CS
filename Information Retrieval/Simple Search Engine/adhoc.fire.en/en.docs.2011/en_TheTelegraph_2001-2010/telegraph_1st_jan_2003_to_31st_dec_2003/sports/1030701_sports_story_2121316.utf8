 Rain ensures dull draw
London: The four-day match between India A and Durham met a watery grave as rain confirmed the expected result, a draw, on the fourth and final day in Chester-le-Street Monday. The tourists reached 95 for three in their second innings before the umpires abandoned the match one over after lunch. (PTI)  Copyright

 Bouncy Mohali pitch on cards, says curator
Mohali: The wicket for the second and final Test between India and New Zealand, beginning on Thursday, is expected to generate good bounce, the curator of the pitch said on Monday. We have worked hard to prepare this wicket. It should offer good assistance to seamers, especially during early hours of the game on all days, chief curator of Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) and a member of the BCCIs grounds and pitches committee, Daljit Singh said. Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble should also love bowling on it on the third and fourth day. Overall, we have tried to keep something for the bowlers as well as the batsmen and lets hope it works the way it is intended, he added. (PTI)  Copyright

 Dejected Hussain threatens to quit
 Nasser Hussain during a press conference in East London Saturday. (Reuters) East London: Nasser Hussain will consider his position as England captain at the end of the World Cup after losing faith in the governing bodies. Hussain, speaking after the World Cup technical committees decision to award his sides group A match in Zimbabwe to the hosts, said Saturday he did not think the ICC had taken Englands security concerns seriously enough. It makes me think more about my long-term future as captain after the tournament, Hussain said. He was particularly angry that the ECB had apologised to ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed on his behalf after the two men had an exchange of views last week. I have absolutely nothing to apologise for, at no stage did I swear or be rude, Hussain said. I just let them know that they had let us down, they should have seen it coming six months ago and seen it snowballing, he added. Hussain said he had lost his trust in authorities in general, and that the Zimbabwe issue had left him as a captain in isolation... Its the players and the cricket that is keeping me going. If I started thinking about the authorities and the way they have behaved, I would be going around in circles. The team is very disappointed, Hussain said. I have seen a group of players whose World Cup dream had been shattered by politics. It should have been sorted out by the ICC six months ago. The authorities have fudged the issue.

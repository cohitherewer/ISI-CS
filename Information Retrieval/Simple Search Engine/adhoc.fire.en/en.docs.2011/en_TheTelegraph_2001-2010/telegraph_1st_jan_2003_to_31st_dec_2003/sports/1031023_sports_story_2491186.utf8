 ICC rejects Shoaib appeal
 Shoaib London: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has lost his appeal against a Test Match and two one-day International ban. Shoaib will miss the second Test against South Africa at Faisalabad starting on Friday and the first two games of a five-match home one-day series against New Zealand next month. Shoaib was banned by ICC Match Referee Clive Lloyd for using foul language against South African tail-ender Paul Adams during the first day of the first Test in Lahore last Friday. Former Australia captain Richie Benaud, appointed to hear the appeal by the ICCs Code of Conduct Commission said Shoaib had admitted he was guilty. In my view, the reason for the implementing of the ICC Code, is so captains in particular and players in general, will embrace the Preamble to the Laws of Cricket, which makes quite clear what is required of them on the field, Benaud said. The appeal I am asked to determine relates to the sentence imposed by Mr Lloyd, not to the actual offence. It seems to me that Mr Lloyd correctly followed the Code of Conduct rules in every way after Shoaib Akhtar accepted, and said, he was guilty. The career of the 27-year-old Shoaib has been fraught with controversy. Last November he was reprimanded for ball-tampering during the first Test against Zimbabwe in Harare. (AFP)  Copyright

 Todd closing in on history 
 Todd Woodbridge has clinched his 75th doubles title Halle: Australian Todd Woodbridge went another step closer to becoming the most successful doubles player of all time when he won his 75th title at the Halle Open on Sunday. Woodbridge and Swede Jonas Bjorkman beat Czech pair Cyrill Suk and Martin Damm 6-3, 6-4 in the final to move the Australian above Frew McMillan into third on the all-time list, two behind American John McEnroe, and three behind Dutchman Tom Okker. Its been a bit of a drought, Woodbridge said, after winning his first title since August 2002. Id be lying if I said I hadnt been thinking about it a lot, maybe too much at times. Ive been taking to John McEnroe about the record a few times, and he says that when I get to 77, hell play the next one with me, he joked. So a guy of his stature knows what Im trying to do. Woodbridge, who won 61 titles in partnership with fellow Australian Mark Woodforde, is only 32 and time is still on his side, although the demands of a young family put extra pressure on his schedule. Id say Ive probably been travelling more this year than any other, he said. But I want to play at the Olympics in 2004, and hopefully that will be enough time to get the record. The clay court season wasnt good, and it feels good to get grass under my feet again. When Jonas and I play our best there are not many teams that can beat us, and that is a good feeling. Woodbridge and Bjorkman will defend their title at Wimbledon later this month, an event the Australian has won seven times.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

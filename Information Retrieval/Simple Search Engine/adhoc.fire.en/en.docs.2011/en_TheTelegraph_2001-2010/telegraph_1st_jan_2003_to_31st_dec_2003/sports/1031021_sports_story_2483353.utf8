The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Not sure when Ill be out: Sourav
 - Badani replaces Team India captain for first two tri-series  matches 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Ganguly  Hemang BadaniChandigarh: The national selectors have replaced regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly with Hemang Badani for the first two tri-series matches only  on October 23 and 26  but its quite likely that Sourav will have a longer lay-off. Indeed, it will be a surprise if he makes a quick return after two surgeries inside five days. The two games are in Chennai (versus New Zealand) and Gwalior (against Australia). Thereafter, four league matches remain, not to speak of the November 18 final  assuming India get there. Im still in considerable pain... So much so that the daily dressings are being done after Ive been put on anaesthesia... Ill not be able to take it otherwise, Sourav told The Telegraph, when contacted (on the cell) in Calcuttas Belle Vue on Monday evening. He added: In fact, at this point in time, I cant put a date as to when Ill be discharged... The doctors will probably be better placed to give an idea after a few more dressings... In any case, the dressings will have to be done for quite some time. Initially, Sourav was to have been discharged on Monday itself. Sourav, it may be recalled, underwent an operation on Saturday morning, less than five days after surgery at the Fortis Hospital in Mohali. The operation was conducted in the same area  left (upper) thigh. Meanwhile, if Yuvraj Singh benefitted by Souravs absence in the Mohali Test, Badani is the ODIs beneficiary. And, the circumstances notwithstanding, he is keen to make an impression after being in the wilderness for 20 months  his last India appearance was during the Mumbai ODI versus Nasser Hussains England. Speaking exclusively from his Chennai residence, Badani said: Frankly, its such a relief... Now, its in my hands to make the most of whatever opportunities again come my way... Will I be under more pressure? Dont think so... If I make the XI, Ill be playing on my home ground (Chepauk)... Surely, that will make a difference... Badani did well on this summers A tour of England and, then, was among the runs in the Challenger. Of course, he came into the picture strongly after a statement-making 127 (for India A, against New Zealand) in Rajkot. That innings will always be special as he got the runs with a fracture above the right wrist  thanks to Darryl Tuffey. I proved a point, Badani had maintained after that knock. He actually did.

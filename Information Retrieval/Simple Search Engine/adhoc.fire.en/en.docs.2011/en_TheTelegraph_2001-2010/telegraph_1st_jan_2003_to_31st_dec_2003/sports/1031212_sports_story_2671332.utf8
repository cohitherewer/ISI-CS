The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bengal sniff outright victory
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sanyal hit a precious 59 Calcutta: Having gone into the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match against Hyderabad with the aim of bagging two points, Bengal perched themselves in a strong position to pocket all four after the end of the penultimate day at Eden Gardens on Thursday. A string of useful partnerships from the bottom half helped the hosts take a lead of 135 in reply to Hyderabads 253. At stumps the visitors were 41 for two, both openers gone, and still trailing by 94 runs. And though the wicket isnt offering vicious turn as it did on Day 1, batting is not going to be easy. Hyderabad do have a mountain to climb here to avoid an outright defeat. A.T. Rayudu and the seasoned D. Vinaykumar are the batsmen they are looking up to at the moment. Bengal took 30 overs to overhaul Hyderabads total after resuming at 153 for three. There were two hiccups  overnight batsmen Arindam Das and Devang Gandhi fell with 53 more to get  and Hyderabad sniffed a chance. Sanjib Sanyal and Laxmi Ratan Shukla snuffed out their hopes with some courageous stroke-play. The allrounders, who had precious little to show with the ball earlier, added 63 in just under 17 overs and showed scant respect for the Hyderabad bowlers including acting captain Shivaji Yadav, who finished with five for 124. The only bowler to command caution and extract turn was carted all over the park by the duo, who not only swung him on the leg-side with the turn, but also cut and drove him against the spin apart from lifting him straight down the ground. Though under pressure, Shukla and Sanjib showed no sign of nerves and their onslaught certainly demoralised the Hyderabad attack. Sanjib posted his fifth Ranji half-century, third of the season, and Shukla fell to a doubtful decision for an entertaining 34. The Bengal innings regained momentum with an eighth-wicket stand of 41 between Sourashish Lahiri and Utpal Chatterjee after the sedate seventh-wicket partnership of Sanjib and Shib Sagar Singh had yielded 40. The last-wicket association of Sourashish and Shib Sankar Paul was worth 44. Souarashish hit five fours and a six in his career-best unbeaten 41 which came off 38 balls. These runs, as admitted by Hyderabad, can prove to be decisive. Earlier, Devang and Arindam had started on a positive note and the former was looking in good touch. Devang was the first player to cut Shivaji on this difficult track and also timed some drives apart from sweeping the off-spinner fluently. Devang wasnt happy with the caught-behind verdict that cut short his stay. Arindam fell for a responsible 91. The recalled opener faced 286 balls and though he let go most of them, hit some well-timed boundaries on either side of the wicket. A maiden hundred was on the cards when he failed to get his gloves away from one that jumped awkwardly. Bengal introduced Utpal in the seventh over of the Hyderabad second innings, but it was Sanyal who got the first wicket an over later. A clever change in field placements fetched the second. With Utpal turning the ball into the left-handed Daniel Manohar, silly point was taken off and placed at leg slip. The move paid off as a turning delivery took the inside edge and Shukla, at leg slip, came up with a smart catch.  Copyright

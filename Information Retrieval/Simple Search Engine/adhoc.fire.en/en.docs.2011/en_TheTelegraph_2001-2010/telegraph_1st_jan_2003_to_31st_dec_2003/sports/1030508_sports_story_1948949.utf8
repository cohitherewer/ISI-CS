 Malleswari now preparing for world championships and Athens New Delhi: Sydney Olympic bronze medallist Karnam Malleswari made a superb comeback after a two-and-a- half-year hiatus, winning the gold in the Commonwealth weightlifting championships held at Nukualofa in Tonga. The meet was held from May 1 to 3. The 28-year-old, who was declared the best lifter in the womens section of the meet, won in the 69kg class, lifting a total of 235 kg. She lifted 102.5kg in snatch and 132.5kg in clean and jerk, which was 2.5 kg more than her Sydney effort. I am now preparing for the world championships and Athens Olympics, said Malleswari at a felicitation function organised by the Indian Olympic Association here on Wednesday. India also won the womens team championship with 193 points beating Nauru (162) and Fiji (151). Other women to win the gold medal were N. Kunjurani Devi (48 kg), Sanamacha Chanu (53 kg), Sunaina (58 kg), Pratima Kumari (63 kg) and Sumati Devi (75 kg). India also won three gold medals in the mens section. Anbu Kathi Ravan won the 62kg class, Satheesha Rai (77 kg) and Senthil Kumar in the 85 kg were the three to bag the top honours. The silver medal winners for India at the meet, where 16 countries took part, were promising junior simple Kaur Bumrah (+75 kg) in the womens section and Vicky Batta (56 kg) and C.P.R. Sudhir Kumar (69 kg) in the mens section. IOA warns coaches After cracking down on the dope-tainted athletes, the IOA said it will not hesitate to take strict action against the erring coaches in a bid to make India dope-free by 2005. We had to start with the athletes. And we will be very strict and take action against the coaches too, IOA president Suresh Kalmadi said at the felicitation. This is not to demoralise the coaches. But we will be very strict. There will be out of competition tests and we will even conduct searches at their homes, Kalmadi said. Newly elected president of Indian Weightlifting Federation, H.S. Dora, warned lifters to be careful against doping. Coaches and lifters should be well aware of the banned substances, he said adding that We will not be found wanting to curb the menace.

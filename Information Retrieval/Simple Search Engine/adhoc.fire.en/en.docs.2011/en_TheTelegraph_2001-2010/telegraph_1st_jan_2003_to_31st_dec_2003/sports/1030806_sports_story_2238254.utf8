The Telegraph - Calcutta
 If we fail, Ill spend more, says Roman
 Abramovich admits he didnt realise buying Chelsea would draw such attention London: Chelseas Russian oil billionaire owner Roman Abramovich said on Tuesday if his expensively assembled side failed on the pitch he would go out and spend more. The 36-year-old told the BBC in his first television interview since buying the club for 140million last month that he had also been surprised by the amount of attention he had received since taking over. I havent thought about how much money I am going to spend, he said. But if I think we need another player because we are not getting the results on the pitch then I will spend the money required. I must say I didnt realise that my buying of Chelsea would receive so much attention, but then football is like a religion in England and I suppose it was merited. Abramovich rejected criticism from some Russians that he should have invested the money in a team in his homeland. Some people, who call themselves Russian patriots, thought I should have spent the money in Russian sport. However it is not a free country like in England and we are not used to people spending money on sports teams. Abramovich has lavished 36.9 million since he bought the club on new signings. Their four new recruits are Southamptons Wayne Bridge (7 million), Blackburn Rovers Irish winger Damien Duff (17 million), Real Madrids Cameroon midfielder Geremi (6.9 million) and West Hams teenage full-back Glen Johnson (6 million). He has also tabled a 15million bid for Argentinian international midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron, though the 28-year-olds club Manchester United have told them to raise their bid.  (AFP)  Copyright

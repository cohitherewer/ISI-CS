 Saqlain, Younis should have been included, says Inzamam
Islamabad: Inzamam-ul Haq and Rashid Latif have joined Javed Miandad in criticising chief selector Aamer Sohails choice of probables for the ensuing one-day International series against New Zealand. Backing Miandads stand that the coach and captain should be consulted before naming a squad, skipper Inzamam said in Lahore he was unhappy with the selection of 22 probables for the five-match series starting on November 22. If I were consulted, I would have suggested the inclusion of Younis Khan and Saqlain Mushtaq. The team needs the experience of Saqlain and Younis, Inzamam said. Former captain Latif, ignored for the ODIs versus New Zealand, said the team will not have the right balance without Mohammed Hafeez, Shahid Afridi and Younis. Latif added he was surprised that Inzamam and Miandad had insisted on the inclusion of Moin Khan in the training camp but not Afridi, Younis and Hafeez. Miandad, meanwhile, had another dig at Sohail, slamming him for changing the team which won the Test series against South Africa and narrowly lost the one day series. Miandad also suggested separate selection committees for the seniors and juniors, adding that no less than 14 youngsters had been victims of the selection committees wrong policy. Not one to take the mud-slinging lying down, Sohail termed the attitude of Miandad as childish. He said that the list of probables had been finalised in the presence of coach, captain and Zia with a consensus that they would be rotated. According to PCB chief executive Rameez Raja, the coach, captain and chief selector have been asked to submit written statements on this matter. Rameez also said Zia had called a clear-the-air meeting for Thursday. (Agencies)  Copyright

 Jugraj back from the US
Bangalore: Injured hockey star Jugraj Singh is back from the US where he underwent treatment for the multiple fractures he suffered in a near-fatal road accident three months ago. The penalty corner specialist will now need physiotherapy and may need to return to the US for another review. After four to six weeks, he (Jugraj) might be required to go back to the United States depending on the progress he makes, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill said, adding that X-ray plates and other medical details would be sent to doctors who treated him there. Gill is certain Jugraj would play in next years Athens Olympics. He (Jugraj) is very determined to come back, and the American doctors who treated him also feel that with his determination and physiotherapy, he should be back, Gill said. We would be glad to have him fit for the Olympic qualifiers. But if that does not happen, my feeling is that he will certainly play in the Olympics, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Double off-spin test for SA 
 - Stage set for dress rehearsal FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Dhaka: Not just the stars,  the people too seem disenchanted with the cricket bonanza  here. How does one explain the near empty stands and the  general lack of interest in the TVS Cup?  The home teams performance has  been anything but encouraging. Add to it, the absence of  Sachin Tendulkar and you have the reasons behind the disillusionment.  Sachins non appearance has robbed  the tournament of spectator interest. Moreover, South Africa  just does not have the mass appeal in these parts. The presence  of Pakistan would have done wonders to the BCB coffers,  remarked an official.  It was destined to be an India-South  Africa final from the moment the tournament was planned.  Post World Cup, it also came as an opportunity to work on  the sides shortcomings or explore new tactics and invade  hitherto unventured avenues.  For India, it has been a test  for the youngsters. Sourav Ganguly is engrossed in his search  for some of the important slots that will fall vacant in  the run-up to the next quadrennial showpiece.  South Africa are going through  a transition phase and it will take some time before they  fall into the groove. Nonetheless, the convincing victories  over the hosts will do enormous good to their morale before  Fridays dress rehearsal to the title showdown.  In Avishkar Salvi, Gautam Gambhir  and Amit Mishra, Sourav has some potent weapons. Very few  fast bowlers have enjoyed the hype and adulation Salvi managed  after the A tour to the West Indies. To be fair to him,  he hasnt disappointed in his brief showing here. The Mumbaiker,  though, was not tested against South Africa in the first  meeting and it will be nice to see how he lives up to the  challenge.  Gambhir, the hero of Wednesdays  win over Bangladesh, and Mishra have also been impressive.  But tougher tests will obviously lie in the days ahead.  They havent done badly considering  its a one-day match. Its now upto the selectors and the  team management to judge their performance, assistant coach  Ashok Malhotra told The Telegraph.  They are doing their job and  only time will help sharpen their performance, Malhotra  added.  Another gain from the tournament  has been Ajit Agarkars form. The allrounder has often been  flayed for his profligate ways and getting to play none  of the World Cup matches has not been of any help.  He, though, has remained focussed  and has shown accuracy in the tough conditions here picking  up wickets regularly. With Jawagal Srinaths future undecided,  he has made a strong bid at the third seamers slot.  The Indians are unlikely to risk  Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh before the final. While Zaheer  is nursing a hamstring injury, Yuvraj is yet to recover  from a bout of fever. The fever has subsided but the weakness  remains. If Yuvraj does make it at the last minute, Sanjay  Bangar will get the boot.  Sourav and Harbhajan Singh are  certain to make a comeback. Out of the team will be Abhijit  Kale and Amit Mishra. This means the Indians will be going  in with two off spinners  Harbhajan and Sarandeep.  For South Africa, tackling the  Indian spinners will be another major test and how they  live up to the challenge in the middle overs could well  decide the course of the game.  Graeme Smith, though, seemed confident.  We will be playing three games in four days. The secret  will be in getting the basics right. If that happens, well  be able to push India.  South Africas batting hasnt  lacked purpose against the run-of-the-mill Bangladesh attack  but India will be a different proposition. The bowling,  at times, has been short of discipline.  For some, the final outcome might  just decide their careers.  TEAMS  India: Virender Sehwag,  Gautam Gambhir, Sourav Ganguly, Mohammed Kaif, Sanjay Bangar/Yuvraj  Singh, Dinesh Mongia, Ajit Agarkar, Parthiv Patel, Harbhajan  Singh, Avishkar Salvi, Sarandeep Singh.

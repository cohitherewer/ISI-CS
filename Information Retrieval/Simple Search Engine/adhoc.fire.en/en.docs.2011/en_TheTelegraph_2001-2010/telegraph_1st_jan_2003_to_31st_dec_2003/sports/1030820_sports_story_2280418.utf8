 Steve plans Udayan model in Hyderabad
Hyderabad: Away from the pressure of competitive cricket, Australian Test skipper Steve Waugh excelled in a different role  answering questions posed by curious children of an orphanage here on Tuesday. Smiling his way into the hearts of street children being rehabilitated by a voluntary organisation Krushi, Steve answered queries ranging from his cricket career to personal life. Waugh expressed his intention to start a home for deprived kids in the city on the lines of Udayan in Calcutta. (PTI)  Copyright

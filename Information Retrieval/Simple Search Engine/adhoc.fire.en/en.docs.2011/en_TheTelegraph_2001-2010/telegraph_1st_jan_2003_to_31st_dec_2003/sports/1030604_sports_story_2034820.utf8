The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dutt wants to meet clubs
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Biswanath Dutt, the former CAB president and the current trustee board chairman, has called all the affiliated clubs for a meeting Wednesday. In the meeting, Dutt will elaborate the reasons why he has decided to leave the association after a stint of 25 years. Talking to The Telegraph, the former BCCI president said: I will make it clear to the club representatives that there shouldnt be a stagnation in the association. I dont think anyone should hold on to a post for all his life. He will tell the club representatives that the stagnation comes only when there is no change, and they should ask for it as and when necessary. The members should decide whether a change is necessary at the helm, Dutt said. He will also ask for some more changes which he feels have become mandatory.  Copyright

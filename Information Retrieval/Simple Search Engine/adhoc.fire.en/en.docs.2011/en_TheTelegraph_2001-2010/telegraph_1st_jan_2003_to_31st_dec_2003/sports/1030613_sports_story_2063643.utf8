 Azhar never got a fair chance, says counsel
Hyderabad: Former Indian cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddins counsel claimed on Thursday that his client was not given enough chance to explain his position regarding allegations of match-fixing. The counsel also alleged that the BCCI had acted with a predetermined mind in proclaiming him guilty. Continuing his arguments before the second additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court here for the third day, Azharuddins counsel alleged that former CBI director K. Madhavan never conducted the inquiry with an open mind. (PTI)  Copyright

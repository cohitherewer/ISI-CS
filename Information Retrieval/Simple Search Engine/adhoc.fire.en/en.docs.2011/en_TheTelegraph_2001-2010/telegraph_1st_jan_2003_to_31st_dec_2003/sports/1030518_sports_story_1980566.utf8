The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahesh-Max advance to final
 Agustin Calleri after beating David Nalbandian to reach the Hamburg Masters final Saturday. (Reuters) New Delhi, May 17 (PTI): Second seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi advanced to the final of the $2.4 million Hamburg Masters meet, beating the third-seeded duo of Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan of the United States in the semi-finals on Saturday. The Indo-Belarussian pair, who had reached the semi-finals in the Masters in Rome last week, won in the last warm-up event for the French Open after a tough battle 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 6-4, according to information received here. But there was disappointment for fifth seeds Leander Paes and Czech David Rikl as the duo lost to world No. 1 Mark Knowles of Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada 3-6, 4-6 in the other semi-final. Bhupathi won the Hamburg title last year with American Jan-Michael Gambill.  Coria-Calleri title clash Reuters adds from Hamburg: Guillermo Coria survived an injury scare and a hotly disputed tiebreak line call to earn a place in the singles final on Sunday against fellow-Argentine Agustin Calleri. Twelfth-seeded Coria needed two and a half hours to overcome Gaston Gaudio 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-0 but Calleri wrapped up a 6-4, 6-1 win over eighth seed David Nalbandian, another Argentine, in just 79 minutes. It was the first time that four players from the same country have contested the semi-finals of a Masters Series tournament. Both Coria and Gaudio showed plenty of touch at the net as well as contesting some fierce baseline rallies but, once he was broken in the second game of the final set, Gaudio virtually conceded the battle and claimed just three points in the last four games. Earlier, Nalbandian paid the price for failing to convert any of six break points he held in the first set or the two he earned in the second. But it was Calleris swiftness around the court that played a major part in taking him to his first Masters Series final.  Copyright

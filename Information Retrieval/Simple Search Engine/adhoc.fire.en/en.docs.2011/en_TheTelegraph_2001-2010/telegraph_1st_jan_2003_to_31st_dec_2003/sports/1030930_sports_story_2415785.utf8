 Chandhok finishes third 
Chennai: Indias new racing star Karun Chandhok ended his 2003 British Forumula III (Scholarship Class) campaign with a fine performance to come third at the Brands Hatch GP Circuit. Chandhoks victory Sunday made him the most successful Indian driver at this level. This was his eighth win of the season taking his tally to a total of 19 podium finishes in all. Karun got 314.5 points to reach the third place in the final championship. This season ended with Karun in third spot in the drivers championship standing, with 10 points separating the top three contenders, the closest ever run in a long time. The car initially was difficult to drive. Here we have very high-speed corners where you need to have confidence to drive it quickly. By the end of the day though the car wasnt too bad and we spotted some problems which we should be able to solve by tomorrow, Chandhok said. Ernesto Viso with 324 points was first while Stevan Kane with 316.5 points came second. (PTI)  Copyright

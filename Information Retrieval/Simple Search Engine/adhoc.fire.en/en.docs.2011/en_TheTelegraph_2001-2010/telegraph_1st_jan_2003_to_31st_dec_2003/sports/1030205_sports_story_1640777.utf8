				 																																	St Johns: The West Indies are seeking to get Marlon Samuels reinstated to their World Cup squad after the middle-order batsman received clearance to play despite his persistent knee injury.				 																																	Ryan Hinds was called into the squad last week in place of Samuels, but Wes Hall, president of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), has begun talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to see if Samuels can still play in the tournament.				 																																	Samuels was examined last weekend by two doctors who decided that the injury to his left knee was not serious enough to prevent him playing in the World Cup.				 																																	Both doctors have concurred that Marlon may return to competitive cricket at all levels  with immediate effect  and we are extremely pleased at this development, Hall told the WICBs official website.				 																																	The reports both share the view that Marlon does, indeed, have a problem with his left knee and that the problem is one, which, because of its chronic nature will require periodic monitoring and evaluation. Both doctors, however, concur that there is no immediate need for surgical intervention.				 																																	We will do all in our power to have Marlon play in this World Cup, Hall added. 				 																																	Port Elizabeth: England allrounder Craig White, who bowled his first ball in weeks Tuesday, was facing a race against time to be fit for the start of the World Cup.				 																																	White has not been included in the England squad for Wednesdays warm-up match against Eastern Province but is pencilled in for a Thursday match against provincial side Border in East London.				 																																	The 33-year-old Yorkshire allrounder tore a side muscle while bowling against Australia in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne, and was told then it would take six weeks to recover. His injury came as a crippling blow to the English attack as White had been their most successful bowler until that stage with 14 Ashes wickets.				 																																	I had my first bowl in however long its been. I was just going at about 80 per cent out there and I sort of bowled good. Its actually been better than I thought it would be, White said Tuesday. I think the big tester will come on Thursday when we play in a game situation, he said. If I get through Thursday, we still got an other week or so before the first game but at least well have an idea of how fit I am. 				 																																	These kind of injuries are always in the back of your mind. When you come back its always there. But Im just going to bowl and try and put up with the pain, he added.				 																																	Johannesburg: Lloyds of London has offered in the excess of $20 million cover in the event of a temporary grandstand collapsing during the World Cup matches in South Africa.				 																																	But the worlds leading insurer refused to provide cover for the matches in Zimbabwe should any of them are cancelled due to political disturbances. 				 																																	Ian Smith, the World Cup organising committees commercial director, said Lloyds were prepared to cover matches in Zimbabwe in the event of rain or public liability, but refuse to underwrite claims resulting from political unrest or civil disturbance. 				 																																	Johannesburg: Lance Klusener is keen to finish off his career with a stint in English County cricket.				 																																	The 31-year-old is keen to play 50 Tests, needing just two more to reach that mark. There have been some offers from counties but nothing definite. Its something Id like to do at the end of my career. I dont know about my future, but there is a tour of England this year, and if I get a chance Id certainly like to play .

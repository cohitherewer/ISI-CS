The Telegraph - Calcutta
 You cant run away from reality: Gibbs 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Cape Town: Had destiny deemed otherwise, Herschelle Gibbs would have been at the SuperSport Park tackling Australias awesome attack. Instead, South Africas highest run-getter in the World Cup (384 at an average of just below 100), is heading for the golf course to recover from the shock of a league-stage exit. Having been a member of the South African XI which lost that tied semi-final, in 1999, heartbreaks arent new to Gibbs. Still, these are difficult days and Gibbs has acknowledged as much in his signed column, Herschelles World, which appeared in Fridays edition of Cape Times. The following are excerpts I have spent (or tried to spend) some quality time with those people closest to me, but Im the sort who needs company, particularly on a golf course... So, Ill be there for the next couple of weeks and catching up with family and friends. Ill certainly watch the rest of the tournament on TV  I wont be avoiding it  but dont ask me who I think will win... Everybody in the squad is trying to come to terms with our early exit.. I know a lot of the guys turned their phones off for a couple of days... Never in my worst or wildest dreams did I imagine this would happen. Sometimes, I may have thought about losing in the final or even the semi-final, but... Some people see it as a simple equation  one run off one ball  and, to be fair, thats what it ended up as... But, there was a ton of thought and planning that went into the run chase before it came down to that... The Team Management did its best... Some of the criticism has been unfair  we may have got it wrong, but it wasnt as if the Team Management was just hoping for the best... Its like a bad cut with stitches: It doesnt stop you from getting on with life, but you have to treat it gently. Contacted on his cellphone, Gibbs told The Telegraph: Frankly, I dont wish to add to what Ive written... The disappointments and... Its part of cricket, thats the way it goes... In time, one has to accept what is reality. You cant run away. Gibbs, at least, is trying to make the best of a terrible bargain. Incidentally, South African cricket continues to be at the receiving end  even off the field: United Cricket Board president Percy Sonn, who was nailed for misbehaving (under the influence of alcohol) after the India-Holland match in Paarl, has failed to make the shortlist for possible judicial appointments.

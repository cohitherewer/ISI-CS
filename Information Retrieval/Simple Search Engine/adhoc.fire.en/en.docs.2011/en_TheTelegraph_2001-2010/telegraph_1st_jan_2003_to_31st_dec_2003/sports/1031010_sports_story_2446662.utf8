The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Abu Dhabi keen to join the ODI bandwagon
New Delhi: Crickets growing global circuit is set to expand further early next year when Abu Dhabi stakes its claim to host one-day Internationals at its new state-of-the-art facility. Local officials hope to rope in world champions Australia, New Zealand and India for the inaugural event in April after a soft-launch in March featuring matches between Indian and Pakistani veterans. The 20,000-seater Sheikh Zayed cricket stadium is being hailed as a marvel of modern architecture and one of the sports most glittering arenas. The complex boasts of expansive dressing rooms for players, floodlights, hospitality suites. The centre-square, comprising eight wickets, is complimented by top-grade practice facilities just outside the main stadium. (AFP)  Copyright

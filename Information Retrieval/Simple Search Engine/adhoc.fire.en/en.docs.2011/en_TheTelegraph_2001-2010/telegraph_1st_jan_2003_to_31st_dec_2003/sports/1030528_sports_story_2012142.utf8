 Paes, Mahesh showdown likely in quarters
New Delhi: Estranged partners Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi are headed for a likely quarter final showdown in the French Open, according to the doubles draw made in Paris Tuesday. Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi of Belarus have been seeded second while Paes and his Czech partner David Rikl are the fifth seeds. Both the teams feature in the bottom-half of the 64-size draw and should the seedings prevail, an exciting clash between the two, who together ruled the doubles circuit a few years ago, is in the offing. Bhupathi and Mirnyi will be up against Thomas Shimada of Japan and Myles Wakefield of South Africa in the first round. Paes and Rikl take on the US-South African duo of Justin Gimelstob and David Adams in the first round.  (PTI)  Copyright

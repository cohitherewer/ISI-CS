The Telegraph - Calcutta
 TFA White whip Bangla 
 - jrd tata Cup l Malswama stars in home teams 3-0 triumph  FROM A CORRESPONDENT  Action during the TFA White-Bangladesh match at JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Saturday. Picture by Bhola Prasad Jamshedpur, Sept. 13: TFA White started their campaign in style by defeating an inexperienced Bangladesh 3-0 in the JRD Tata international invitational football tournament at the JRD Tata Sports Complex on Saturday. The home team took full advantage of a weak Bangladesh midfield and an equally shaky defence. The victory margin could easily have been bigger had some other chances been converted. The visiting teams tactical error in leaving striker Malswama unmarked for most of the time proved costly. The short and stocky player from Mizoram, who along with Jerry Zirsanga is the mainstay of this TFA team, took full advantage of this freedom. He was a steady source of supply for Zirsanga and Vanlal Rova and could have opened the account for his team had his shot from just outside the box not grazed the bar in the 18th minute. Rova, however, in the 35th minute snatched the lead. Manjus throw from the right landed inside the box. The ball bounced and reached Rova who slotted it in to the left of Bangladesh keeper Khaled Mohammad Azam. Playing 3-5-2 proved handy for the Indians as the midfielders kept on feeding the frontline. They created another opening which resulted in a goal in the 38th minute. Zirsanga sent in a high cross to Sutang Marlanki from the right. The energetic Marlanki ran solo with two Bangladesh defenders behind him. With just the goalkeeper in front, all Marlanki had to do was slot the ball in but he was tripped by the custodian and the referee Surendra Sikhrakar awarded a penalty kick. Gurjinder Singh made no mistake. Marlanki had to leave the ground in the second half after suffering an injury. Coach Stephen Constantine said the player may have torn a ligament. The session after the breather saw Bangladesh try to make a match of it. Meanwhile, Mohammad Anower Hossains powerful right-footer from outside the box in the 51st minute was well saved by the home team goalkeeper. Sensing that the Bangladesh midfield had woken up, the Indians pressed for goals. They should have gone 3-0 up soon had Debabrata Roy been alert. Rovas cross from the right was shot by Roy straight to the goalkeeper but the rebound was cleared by a Bangladesh defender just in time. But Roy soon created the third goal when he sent a crisp pass to Malswama, who ran almost straight to the Bangladesh goalmouth. A scramble followed and resulted in an own goal. Shaikh Shamimur Rahman of Bangladesh got the final touch. TFA Blue will take on Uzbekistan in Sundays encounter.  Copyright

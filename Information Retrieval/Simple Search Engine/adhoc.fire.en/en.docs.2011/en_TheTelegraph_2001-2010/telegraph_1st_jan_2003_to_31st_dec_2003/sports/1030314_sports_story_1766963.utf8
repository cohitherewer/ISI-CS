The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kenya wish to renew Patil contract
 Nairobi: Kenyan cricket chiefs said Thursday they were willing to meet national coach Sandeep Patil to discuss a possible renewal of his contract which ends after the World Cup. I am well aware the contract is up but we will be keen to meet Patil after the tournament to discuss whether he would accept our terms, said Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) president Jimmy Rayani. [It may be recalled that The Telegraph reported last week itself that Patil was keen on returning to India once the contract ended with the World Cup.] I signed a four-year contract just after the last World Cup which ends at the conclusion of the tournament, Patil had said. I have decided to return to India. I dont have a position to go back to, but Mr. (Jagmohan) Dalmiya, the BCCI president, has shown an interest, he added. Tikolo unhappy Meanwhile, Kenya have picked up another set of brothers for their Cup campaign, but captain Steve Tikolo is reportedly unhappy with the decision. Former South African Test batsman Peter Kirsten has been passing on tips to the team as a favour to brother, Andrew, who works as assistant to Patil.  I have been to the nets and have spoken to one or two of the players. I have asked Tikolo to cut out the hook shot and to move his feet early. Yet, Steve keeps on getting out off the hook shot. Hes been out in that fashion on at least two occasions, Peter said. (AFP)  Copyright

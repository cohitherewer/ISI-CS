The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zamorano calls it quits
Santiago, July 19 (Reuters): Chile striker Ivan Zamorano announced his retirement on Friday at a new conference alongside President Ricardo Lagos in the presidential palace. Fans gathered outside the palace, calling on the 36-year-old Zamorano, who enjoys cult status in Chile, to reconsider. I have made the most important decision of my career, to say goodbye to soccer. A new life begins now, said Zamorano. The player said Lagos deserved to be the first to know that he was retiring because he was a close friend. Zamorano said he would now dedicate himself to philanthropic work through his own foundation and as an ambassador for UNICEF.  Copyright

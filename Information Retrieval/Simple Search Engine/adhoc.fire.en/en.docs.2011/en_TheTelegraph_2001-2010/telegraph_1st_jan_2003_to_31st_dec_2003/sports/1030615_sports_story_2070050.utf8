 Clubs ridicule meet
 - Confederations Cup l Its an aberration: Deschamps  Brazilian players during a warm-up session in Paris Friday. Brazil take on Cameroon on June 19. (Reuters) Paris, June 14 (AFP): The Confederations Cup is hopefully a thick-skinned individual for, if not, it is likely to be feeling a little sore after all the insults hurled at it over the past year. Frances World Cup winning captain Didier Deschamps has attacked the competition which starts in France on Wednesday as an aberration. Europes key clubs have all dismissed it as superfluous. Deschamps main gripe is that the Confederations Cup places an extra burden on players fitness. The Monaco coach said: This Confederations Cup is an aberration. Its an event that attacks the physical integrity of players, they wont have time to recover. We (the French League) start on August 2, France get together on June 11, and we finish the season on May 24: that doesnt leave a lot of time to recuperate. Deschamps comments mirror the opinion from the G14 group of Europes top teams. G14 director general Thomas Kurth explained: Were opposed to this competition. Weve tried to be conciliatory, constructive, to find a solution. Otherwise well have to scale down competitions across the board. Clubs are lending their players, but they dont get anything in return. Do the sums yourself  a major player costs his club between 4,000 and 5,000 euros a day.  Copyright

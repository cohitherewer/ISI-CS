 Murali looks to slow down
 Muralidharan Kandy: Sri Lankas injury-prone star Muttiah Muralidharan wants to slow down after being described by the teams former physiotherapist as a bio-mechanical mess. The off-spinner, one of the most prolific wicket-takers in the modern game and rated highly by Wisden, has been plagued by injuries over the last few years. At 30, when cricketers are considered to be at the peak of their game and fitness, Muralidharan has already suffered a dislocated shoulder, a hernia operation, torn quadriceps and a niggling groin. Alex Kontouri, the Lankan teams physiotherapist for eight years who quit last week for family reasons, said in a recent interview that Muralidharan was a bio-mechanical mess who needed to be nursed carefully. And the star bowler, hoping to play international cricket for at least four more years, has heeded the advice quickly. Muralidharan hopes to pick and choose his one-day matches in order to stay fit for the 2007 World Cup. I want to play only major tournaments, Muralidharan said. (AFP)  Copyright

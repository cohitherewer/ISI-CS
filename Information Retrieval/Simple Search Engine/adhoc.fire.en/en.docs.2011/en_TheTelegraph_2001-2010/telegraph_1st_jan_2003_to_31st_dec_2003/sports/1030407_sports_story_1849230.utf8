 Raikkonen annexes title
Sao Paulo: Finn Kimi Raikkonen won the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix for McLaren in extraordinary circumstances on Sunday after the rain-hit race was stopped after 54 of the 71 laps. Jordans Giancarlo Fisichella, who in the initial confusion thought he had won his first race in his 110th start, was second with Spains Fernando Alonso third in his Renault. But Alonso was absent from the podium as he had been taken from the track on a stretcher after his car ploughed into the wreckage of Australian Mark Webbers Jaguar, whose crash caused the race to be stopped. Before that it had been a race for survival in the rain, with turn three particularly hazardous and accounting for five withdrawals, including that of world champion Michael Schumacher whose miserable season continued when he skidded off on lap 27.

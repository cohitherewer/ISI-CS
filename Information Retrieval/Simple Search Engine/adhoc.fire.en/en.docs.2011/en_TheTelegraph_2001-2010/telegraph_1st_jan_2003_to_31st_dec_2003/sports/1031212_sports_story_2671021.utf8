The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Everytime Ive thought well, Ive batted well
 - Being defensive to a bad ball never helps, says Sourav  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav thinks you need courage in Australia and South Africa Adelaide: First came the concern over Harbhajan Singhs form. Not much later, the worry over his fitness. Even as that was taken care of  by way of Murali Kartik being rushed as the 17th player  spearhead Zaheer Khan couldnt complete the nets session on Thursday. If not anything else, Team India captain Sourav Ganguly is having to quickly redraw strategy ahead of the second Test. Despite being pressed for time, specially owing to the Zaheer development, Sourav spoke to The Telegraph for around 25 minutes before the customary Test-eve team meeting. The following are excerpts Q Generally, you must be on a high after the 144 in Brisbane... A (Grins) Am definitely more confident... Theres nothing like getting a big score in the first innings of a Test series... Four-five days on, what does that knock mean to you? Quite a bit... As I said then itself, Ive realised a dream. However, I cant afford to rest on that one innings. Individual contributions must be seen in a larger perspective... Cricket, after all, is a team sport where everybody has a role. Among other things, that effort has probably taken some of the pressure off Sachin Tendulkar... Perhaps... At the same time, lets not forget that Rahul (Dravid) and (V.V.S.) Laxman also play a big role in this team... Theres pressure on them too. Is there a worry that you will now be targeted more aggressively by Steve Waugh? No... I expect the Australians to come hard but, then, thats the challenge before me. Moreover, at this level, runs dont come easy. I know that. Youve been speaking of the difference being all in the mind. Will you elaborate? Look, cricket has become such a mental game... Talking from experience, Ive batted well everytime Ive thought well... The clearer one is in the mind, the better the chances of succeeding... Its related. Specifically, what did Greg Chappell suggest during your brief interaction earlier this year? Mainly that I should remain positive... Technically, he emphasised the importance of footwork. Our last tour of Australia was in 1999-2000. Whats the top lesson you learnt then? Two things: That I must build on a good start and shouldnt allow negative thoughts to take root. For a batsman to come good (particularly in Australia), he has to be positive. We were in more than a spot of bother (62 for three) when you took guard. What did you tell yourself? That, whatever the position, any ball which deserves to be hit will be put away. Indeed, being defensive to a bad ball never helps. As you know, Im not the sort to defend and defend... Thats not my style. But, yes, any risk-taking should be minimal. There were two warm-up games before the first Test. How long did it take you to adjust? Actually, adjustment has never been a worry... It does take a couple of days, but the body begins to move in the required manner without much effort... Playing the cut, for instance, began to come naturally here. (After a pause) The adjustment bit apart, you need courage in Australia and South Africa... If you arent gutsy, then... But, surely, theres a bigger demand on technique... Courage as well. The batsmen did get their act right at the Gabba, but were you satisfied with our bowling? No... Zaheer was outstanding and Ajit Agarkar was good in spells... Bhajju (Harbhajan) struggled and Ashish Nehra needs to improve... Shouldnt Harbhajan have undergone surgery after the tri-series in Dhaka? Initially, that was to have been so... Not being a man of medicine, though, I cant make a definite comment... Bhajju must have followed the advice of specialists. (Again after a pause) While I agree he hasnt been at his best, he has been a matchwinner. We ought not to forget that... Given the amount of cricket, some wear and tear is inevitable. As captain, Ive got to be prepared for such situations. Looking back, do you feel Kartik should have been around from the very beginning? Well, as long as only two specialist spinners will be picked, its going to be difficult for him to be chosen ahead of Anil Kumble and Bhajju. Now, with there being a question mark over the latter, Kartik will have opportunities coming his way. Are you upset that Zaheer has had to make himself unavailable (for the second Test) because of a hamstring problem? He was fit when we left for nets (on Thursday morning) but, then, couldnt last the session... Hes out for a week and Ive simply got to accept this reality. Do you intend having a leisurely one-on-one with Steve, somebody you respect, before the series gets over? Nothing is planned, but we did have a chat during one of the interruptions in the first Test... In the midst of a series, its tough finding time. The final question: What was the theme of your speech during the first team meeting (in Melbourne) after touching down in Australia? That we have a huge challenge... That everybody needs to stand up and be counted... That each one of us will know where exactly he stands by the end of this tour (February 10)...  Copyright

 New helmet may help Schumacher 
London: Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher hopes a fighter-pilot style helmet can help him go even faster this season by reducing the ear-splitting din of his Ferrari engine. The noise is something he wants to reduce, the Germans spokeswoman Sabine Kehm said on Thursday. Kehm said that the helmet, being developed by German firm Schuberth, would be closed around his head with Schumacher breathing through a sealed mouthpiece in the same way as fighter pilots.

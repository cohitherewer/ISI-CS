  Milan: AC Milan drew 1-1 with city rivals Inter on Tuesday to reach the Champions League final.Andriy Shevchenko gave Milan the lead in their second leg semi-final at the San Siro stadium on the stroke of halftime but Obafemi Martins equalised with seven minutes left.AC Milan, who were the away side on Tuesday, went through on the away goals rule. The first leg had ended 0-0 last week.In the final on May 28, they will play either Real Madrid or Juventus who meet in Turin on Wednesday with the Spanish side leading 2-1 after the first leg.Shevchenko got past defender Ivan Cordoba as he cut into the penalty area after latching on to a pass from Clarence Seedorf and then lifted his shot over advancing keeper Francesco Toldo.Chances had been rare with both sides conceding possession in a packed midfield and it was long balls forward that produced the only other real efforts on goal.The tension threatened to spill over at times with several off-the-ball incidents. Milans Filippo Inzaghi, Gennaro Gattuso and Rui Costa all picked up yellow cards along with Inters Luigi Di Biagio who will miss the final.  Copyright

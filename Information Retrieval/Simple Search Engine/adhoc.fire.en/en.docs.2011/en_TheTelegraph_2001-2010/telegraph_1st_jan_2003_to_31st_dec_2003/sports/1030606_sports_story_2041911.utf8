 Burnout our biggest fear, says Ponting
 Ricky Ponting hopes people will start listening soon enough Sydney: Australias World Cup-winning captain Ricky Ponting says that burnout caused by exhausting playing schedules is the teams biggest fear. Ponting, 28, arrived with his side at Sydney airport Thursday after leading the world champions to a 4-3 victory in the one-day series against Brian Laras West Indies. Steve Waugh, 38, had captained Australia to a 3-1 win in the Test series earlier in the two-month Caribbean tour. I think that (burnout) is the fear of everyone at the moment, Ponting told reporters. All the players want to play as much cricket for Australia as they can, but at the same time dont want to be worn out, fatigued and have their careers cut a little bit shorter than they might have been. Thats the biggest fear weve got in the team and weve mentioned that to various people and hopefully people will start listening to us pretty soon. Australias cricketers, who have been playing virtually non-stop since November last year, will have a short break at home before hosting a two-Test series against Bangladesh in July. The Australian Cricket Board reacted to pressure from players last week by cancelling the teams involvement in a one-day meet in northern Africa scheduled for August and September. We are very conscious of the need for players to now have a break, ACB chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement Thursday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ive been dedicated and have sacrificed quite a bit: Clarke
 - Aussie youngster eager to earn first Test cap  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Michael Clarke after his century at the Bellerive Oval on Sunday. (PTI) Hobart: Michael Clarke, 22, isnt just Australias hottest young cricketer, he is being seen as a future captain. In fact, he has already captained Australia U-19 and was the A team vice-captain in the three-dayer here. Easy-going, Clarke spoke to The Telegraph during lunch on Sunday  unusual, as he was still batting  but he kept the appointment after missing an earlier one (Saturday evening). Perhaps, this is one more indication that the right-hand batsman who bowls left-arm spin isnt a stereotype. The following are excerpts On what attracted him to cricket I must have been around seven when I began playing... That my father (Les), who runs an indoor sport centre, was a grade-level cricketer obviously influenced my decision... Then, coming in contact with an Anglo-Indian coach at the centre, Neil DCosta, made me more involved with the game... He remains my coach and has also become my manager. On the player he admired as a youngster Michael Slater... Loved his approach, his aggression, loved his positive nature... In any case, youngsters get attracted to the dashing type... In more recent years, Ive been a fan of Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar. Brian Lara as well. On whether he regards himself as a batsman who bowls or an allrounder (Laughs) Most definitely a batsman who bowls. On his approach Im a positive person and that comes through in my cricket... Ive got loads of energy, Im focussed... If I may add, Ive been dedicated and have sacrificed quite a bit. On the Establishment viewing him as a captain in-the-making Oh, thats a long way off. First, Ive got to establish myself in the one-day side and, then, look to earning the first Test cap... Its nice if people are looking at me that way but, really, theres much distance to cover. (After a pause) Not too long ago, playing for Australia was a dream... Having realised that, today, I wish to look at the next step only. Actually, Im yet to get over having been in the same dressing room as the Pontings. On what makes the Australian team tick The professionalism... Sticking together and helping each other out... Somebody or the other is always around to offer advice. On the recent tri-series in India It was a quality experience... I tried to take in as much of the culture I could, but it used to be difficult getting out of the hotels... I mean, the passion is so high... The final (at the Eden), of course, was quite another experience... A 100,000... Phew... On having had a taste of the pressure which goes with international cricket Ive looked at the games as opportunities... Indeed, Ive consciously not put myself under any more pressure than is warranted... For a sportsman, theres nothing better than playing for your country. My priority is to make the most of every opportunity. On Michael Bevan picking him as a potential great in limited overs cricket Im thankful to him but, as Ive said, theres lots that I need to do before I can be recognised as... On his interests outside cricket Rugby, cars, football... Im a David Beckham fan... Apart from being so gifted, he carries himself off the field so well... I would root for Manchester United, as long as Beckham was there. On his Slater-like fascination for cars (Laughs again) Yeah, Ive got a BMW, like Slater... However, I wish I had a Ferrari, which Slater once owned... It wouldnt be a bad idea if Michael Schumacher gifted me one, in the manner Sachin got a present! Finally, on the foreseeable future Well, right now, I would like to add to my lunch score (58). [As it turned out, the New South Welshman went on to remain unbeaten on 131 (237 minutes, 140 deliveries, 12x4, 4x6), his maiden first-class century of the season. He was not out in the first innings as well, on 38.]  Copyright

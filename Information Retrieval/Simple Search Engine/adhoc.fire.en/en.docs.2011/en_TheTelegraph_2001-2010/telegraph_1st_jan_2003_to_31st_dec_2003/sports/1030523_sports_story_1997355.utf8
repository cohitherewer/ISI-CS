The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hewitt, Agassi up against it
French Open - Its a challenge and Ive always liked challenges, says world No. 1 ALLROUNDER: David Nalbandian, last years Wimbledon finalist, can be equally formidable on clay London: Top-and-tailing the French Open draw, Lleyton Hewitt and Andre Agassi know they will face a mammoth task next week as a legion of Latin baseliners look to bury the favourites in Roland Garros clay.Former champions and dogged battlers from Spain, Argentina, Brazil and Chile pepper the draw as the second Grand Slam of the year slides into action.Hewitt may be sitting atop the world rankings but he is not high on confidence on the slow surface while Agassi must pray his 33-year-old legs can motor him around the famous Parisian clay as swiftly as in previous years.The tournament is a showpiece for France but it is the Latins who are most at home and there will be no margin for error for Agassi or Hewitt as the baseliners snap at their heels.Certainly Agassi knows it will not be easy but he has an edge the younger players are missing  experience.Im at a place in my career where I have the luxury of using my experience. Most people who have my experience arent playing any more, he says. My body is still holding up, my mind is still eager and my heart still wants it. So now I can use my experience.Equally hungryHewitt is equally hungry but realises it may be lack of experience which costs him.Maybe I have to work a bit harder on clay, he freely admits. Its a challenge and Ive always liked challenges.Whether I will ever win the French (Open) and master playing on clay, who knows? But Ill give it a shot.Juan Carlos Ferrero lurks immediately beneath the top two. Runner-up last year and a semi-finalist in 2001 and 2000, the Spaniard is desperate to go one better this time round.Victories in Monte Carlo and Valencia in recent months are testament to his form.Seeded fourth lies Carlos Moya, no stranger to glory at the Stade Roland Garros.In 1998 he lifted the French crown and went on to take number one spot in the rankings. Paris is the biggest goal for me, he warned all comers earlier this week.Moyas vanquished opponent five years ago was Alex Corretja  another Spaniard who will also pose a threat in the French capital  seeded 16th this time. Reigning champion Albert Costa sits menacingly in the ninth seeded position.The power of the Spaniards is beyond question but it is the form of the Argentines which has grasped the imagination this month. The nation made history last week when four Argentines reached the semis of the Hamburg Masters  marking the first time any four countrymen had ever made the final four at a Tennis Masters Series event.The historical feat was accomplished by David Nalbandian, Guillermo Coria, Agustin Calleri and Gaston Gaudio. Coria clinched the title but all four are sure to be a threat in Paris. Nalbandian, in fact, proved his allcourt skills by reaching the 2002 Wimbledon final. The Argentine success doesnt really surprise me, Coria said. We are a very good group and we play at a very high level. There has been a lot of bad news from Argentina and I think that us sportsmen, we can give our people something to think about which is positive and forget the negative things.Krajicek, Anna outFormer Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek and struggling Russian glamour girl Anna Kournikova have both withdrawn from the meet.Krajicek, 31, is suffering from an elbow injury while Kournikova has an adductor problem. Both will be replaced by lucky losers, organisers said.The Dutchman won Wimbledon in 1996 but has not claimed a title in the past three years and is currently ranked 71st in the world. Kournikova, still searching for her first career title, has this year suffered the worst slump of her career, dropping out of the worlds top 50 as a result of poor form and injuries.  Copyright

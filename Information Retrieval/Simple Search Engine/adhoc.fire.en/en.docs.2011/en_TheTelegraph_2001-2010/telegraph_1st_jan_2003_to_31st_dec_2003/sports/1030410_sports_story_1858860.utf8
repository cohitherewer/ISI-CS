The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rebel circuit meeting today
London: Formula Ones major carmakers will meet team bosses Thursday hoping to secure their commitment to a new championship run by them from 2008. The manufacturers have invited the 10 teams to a meeting in Munich to present the latest Grand Prix World Championship (GPWC) proposals. They need team bosses to start making a firm commitment, one source at a GPWC-linked team said. Theyre not expecting anyone to sign up to the proposals per se but to signal an intent to do so. The five main European carmakers involved are BMW, Ford, Mercedes parent Daimler-Chrysler, Ferrari owners Fiat and Renault. Renault vice-president Patrick Faure told The Guardian newspaper that the GPWC would present their business plan. I have the feeling that things are very clear, said Faure. There has been the first era of Formula One, now there will be another. We are happy to keep Bernie (Ecclestone) as CEO, but the majority of the money generated by Formula One has to go to the teams.

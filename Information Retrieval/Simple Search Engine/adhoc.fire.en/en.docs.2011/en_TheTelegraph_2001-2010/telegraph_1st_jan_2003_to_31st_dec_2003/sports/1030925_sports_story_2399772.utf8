 Marsh: No let-up in Aussie dominance
Perth: Australia were likely to remain a dominant force in the foreseeable future, Geoff Marsh forecast here on Wednesday. An opening batsman who represented Australia in 50 Tests before becoming a national selector and coach, Marsh made the prediction on arrival at home as coach of the Zimbabwe side preparing for two Tests next month against the world champions. I think Australias future is very bright, Marsh said. You just have to look at the pace bowling. While Glenn McGraths career may be coming to an end, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie are still young and Andy Bichel has a lot of cricket left in him. The 33-year-old McGrath, regarded by many as the worlds best paceman, has been afflicted by injuries in recent months. He had an ankle surgery last month and is in some doubt for the first Test against Zimbabwe, starting in Perth on October 9. Lee, 26, and Gillespie, 28, probably have their best years ahead. Bichel, though 33, remains fit and appears to have several years top cricket left. Marsh said he had seen the Australian under-19 team which won the World Cup a year ago. I saw some terrific cricketers in that team. They are now just coming through the system. There are a lot of very good players coming through. Australia are No. 1 because they are very professional, they do things well.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Pak complete formalities

(AFP) Lahore: Pakistan took just 41 balls to complete an eight-wicket victory over South Africa in the first Test on Tuesday, their first ever home Test win over the South Africans. Pakistan resumed on 137 for one, requiring 24 more runs for victory, and needed only 24 minutes to get them as they finished on 164 for two. Shoaib Malik hit South Africa captain Graeme Smith to the mid-wicket boundary for the winning runs. Taufeeq Umar was the only wicket to fall on the final day, the opener completing a fine match in his comeback following a knee injury. Umar, declared joint Man-of-the-Match with spinner Danish Kaneria, followed up his 111 in the first innings with a powerful 63 off 114 balls, including nine fours. The left-hander was unlucky to be bowled by Paul Adams, who conceded 57 runs from 11 overs. Pakistans only other Test win over South Africa was in 1998 in Durban when fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar took five wickets. It was South Africas second successive Test defeat after losing to England at the Oval in September which allowed the hosts to draw the series 2-2. The foundation for the win was laid on the fourth day when Akhtar and Kaneria wrecked South Africas batting. Taufeeq and Imran Farhat (58) then added a quickfire 134, setting a new record by posting their second century stand of the match, the first time in 296 Tests that Pakistan enjoyed century opening partnerships in both innings. Smith said his team had under-performed. We let ourselves down, he said. We didnt bowl well. We need to regroup now to square this series. Smith called for technology to be used more in Test cricket after two of his top batsmen, Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis, were victims of contentious umpiring decisions in the second innings. I think television has got to play a role somewhere, said Smith, alluding to the two poor decisions on the fourth day.  (Agencies)  Copyright

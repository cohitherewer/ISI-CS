 Aussies not to take it easy
Sydney: Australia will be under orders not to take it easy when they face struggling Bangladesh next month, coach John Buchanan said on Friday. Australia will host the Asian side in two Tests and three one-dayers in July and August. Although Bangladesh have never won a Test and have not enjoyed a one-day victory for over four years, Buchanan said there would be no room for charity. Our game will always be to be as aggressive as we can, Buchanan said in Darwin, the venue for the first Test. We try and put our opposition under as much pressure as we can, right from the word go, so that wont change. Buchanan does, however, expect Bangladesh to become a more competitive side after appointing Dav Whatmore as coach. I think what hell do is bring them direction, I think he will bring them some discipline and give them some shape. Whether that happens immediately time will tell, but I think thats a very good move for them and something that will improve their cricket a little bit quicker than maybe what it has done in the past.

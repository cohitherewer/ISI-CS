The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its advantage Harbhajan 
- Sourav juggles option with Kumble  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Cape Town: Its one thing to make the World Cups Super Six, quite another to actually progress from there. First-timers Kenya are aware of that, though they do have the weight of (10) carried-over points behind them.Yet, if they are eyeing a repeat of Gwalior (1998) or Port Elizabeth (2001), they could be in for much despair: Sourav Gangulys Team India is currently on such a high that a potentially bitter lesson awaits Steve Tikolo and his men.If the Indians do have a worry, its the toss. Of course, Sourav didnt harp on that too much Thursday, on the eve of the first Super Six game, but Newlands is known to be partial towards seam and swing when the floodlights are on.In fact, concern over the toss apart, Souravs worry (in the lead-up) had everything to do with the sole specialist spinners slot. Harbhajan Singh... Anil Kumble... Harbhajan... Kumble... Harbhajan... Rarely has the captain been in such a dilemma: Should he drop the seasoned Kumble after one failure (against Pakistan) or give him another chance? Reaching for the answer  bringing back Harbhajan, according to The Telegraphs sources  caused a bigger headache than the Kenyans potential to create a flutter.That Harbhajan will be back was almost certain by late Wednesday. However, some 16 hours later, Kumbles chances of retaining his berth improved dramatically. By late Thursday, it was back to advantage Harbhajan.The captain has gone through an agonising time... In principle, he is opposed to dropping somebody after just one match. At the same time, many with influence kept suggesting that Harbhajan be brought back, observed a well-placed source.Eventually, Sourav appears to have gone with the (internal) majority view. The Kenyans, on the other hand, dont have to tackle such a sensitive issue. According to coach Sandeep Patil, they will be picking from XIII  out of contention are former captain Aasif Karim and Alpesh Vadher. Light rain is forecast in the morning and, so, we will wait and see what the conditions really are, Patil, looking to build on the Sri Lanka-upset, added.That stunning win remains Kenyas No.1 achievement in this edition, but their batting has left much to be desired. A top score of 217 for seven, that too versus Bangladesh, cant be anybodys idea of inspiration. Worse, after qualifying for the Super Six, the Kenyans got thrashed by the West Indies.Whether they are worth just the 104 scraped against the West Indies will soon be known. Only, the appetite of the Jawagal Srinaths has been whetted. For Team India, Friday offers an excellent opportunity of adding to the (eight) carried-over points and an increase by four will take off much of the pressure in the more demandi- ng games  versus Sri Lanka (March 10) and New Zealand (March 14).Right now, we are taking it one at a time, insisted Sourav, who should be looking at a handsome score to boost confidence before the home stretch of this World Cup. The cynosure, though, will be the peerless Sachin Tendulkar, who is comfortably placed for the Man of the Tournament award.Virender Sehwag, who hurt his right index finger while attempting a high catch Wednesday, is fully fit. The time for him to fire is long overdue.

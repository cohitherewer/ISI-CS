				 																																	London: England all rounder Craig White will be out of action for around three months after undergoing surgery on a rib injury, his county Yorkshire said on Wednesday. Following problems with his side throughout the winter, investigations revealed problems with the bottom rib and he underwent surgery this morning, Yorkshire said in a statement.				 																																	The surgeon has removed a piece of rib approximately two inches in length. This will rule him out of any England selection for approximately three months but it is hoped that he will return to county cricket sooner.				 																																	The 33-year-old has played 30 Tests and 51 one-day Internationals since making his England debut in 1994.				 																																	Colombo: Sri Lanka has denied there was any move to shift the jinxed South Asian Federation (SAF) Games from Islamabad to Colombo so that the oft-postponed event could go ahead.				 																																	Sri Lankas National Olympic Committee (NOC) chairman Hemasiri Fernando quashed a Pakistani news agency report which quoted unnamed top officials and said the Games, which have been postponed thrice, may be shifted from Pakistan to Sri Lanka.				 																																	I cannot say whether the Pakistan officials have any such idea. But we have not yet been informed of it, Fernando was quoted as saying in the Daily Mirror on Wednesday. 				 																																	Fernando also said even if there was such a proposal, Sri Lanka was not in a position to honour it.  				 																																	London: There were no positive drugs tests at the 2003 World Cup, the ICC said on Wednesday.				 																																	The South African Institute for Drug Free Sport (SAIDFS) conducted 100 random tests on players during the tournament. Samples handled by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) accredited laboratory were found to be negative.				 																																	Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne was sent back from the World Cup after testing positive for diuretics, but he was tested before the start of the tournament. Warne has since been banned for 12 months.				 																																	This was the first time dope tests were used at a cricket World Cup. They were carried out at all Super Six games, both semi-finals and the final.				 																																	Hyderabad: Sania Mirza and Sanaa Bhambri moved into the pre-quarter finals of the Japan Open (junior) grade one tournament, according to information received here on Wednesday. While Sania defeated Al Tomiyana of Japan 6-3, 6-3, Sanaa prevailed over Nana Tshuchiya, also of Japan 1-6, 6-4, 3-6.				 																																	n Football: Premier League highlights at 9 am on Star Sports n Football: Uefa Champions League at 2.30 pm and 5.30 pm on ESPN n Cricket: First Test, West Indies vs Australia live from 7.30 pm on ESPN n Golf: Augusta Masters live from 12.30 am on Star Sports

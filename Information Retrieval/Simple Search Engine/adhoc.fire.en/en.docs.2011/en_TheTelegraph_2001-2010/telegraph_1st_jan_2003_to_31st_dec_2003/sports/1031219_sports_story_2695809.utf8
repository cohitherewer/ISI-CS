 Firoz takes lead
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Calcuttas former Indian Open champion Firoz Ali set a sizzling pace with a opening-day card of six-under 66 to lead the Rs 15-lakh Tata Open field in Jamshedpur Thursday. According to information reaching here, unheralded Roop Singh of Chandigarh and Lucknows Vijay Kumar returned cards of five-under each to share the second position in this tenth leg of the Hero Honda Indian Golf Tour over the Beldih and Golmuri Club courses. Playing at the par-70 Golmuri Golf Club, the hard-working pro from Bangalore C. Muniyappa submitted a card of four-under 66 to be in the fourth position overall. Sanjay Kumars three-under 69 was the next best card at the par-72 Beldih course. Firoz stumbled over the par-3 opening hole, but picked up birdies thereafter to move to the top, making the turn at one-under.  Copyright

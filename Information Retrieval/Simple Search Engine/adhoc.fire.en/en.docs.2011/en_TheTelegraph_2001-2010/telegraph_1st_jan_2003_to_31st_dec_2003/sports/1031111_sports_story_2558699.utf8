 Mancini stars in Roma win
 Mancini in Rome on Sunday Rome: Two late goals by Brazilian midfielders Mancini and Emerson gave AS Roma a dramatic 2-0 win over city rivals Lazio that lifted them to second in Serie A on Sunday. The match appeared on the verge of fizzling out to a scoreless draw when Mancinis spectacular 81st-minute volley with the inside of his heel beat Lazio keeper Matteo Sereni. Five minutes later Mancini sent a high pass over the top of Lazios defence to pick out Emerson, who dispatched a clinical low shot into the corner of the net. Mancinis goal capped a memorable first derby appearance after the 23-year-old joined Roma during the close season from Serie B club Venezia. When I arrived in Rome there was some debate about whether Id be able to compete at Serie A level. I feel Ive done my talking on the pitch, he told reporters afterwards. Roma are now two points behind league leaders Juventus on the same mark as AC Milan but with a better goal difference. A scruffy first half produced few chances and Romas best chance was after 43 minutes when a fumble by Lazio keeper Sereni spilled the ball invitingly into the path of Emerson but his shot was cleared off the line by Lazio defender Jaap Stam. Lazio toiled until the 58th minute for their first true shot on goal when midfielder Dejan Stankovic fired directly at keeper Ivan Pelizzoli. The introduction of striker Roberto Muzzi gave Lazio more forward momentum, but just when it seemed they might score, Roma won a free kick on the edge of the area, and Antonio Cassanos waist-high delivery was flicked masterfully by Mancini into the net. Emersons goal sealed the result and Norwegian striker John Carew even came close to adding a third. The defeat capped a nightmare week for Lazio coach Roberto Mancini after the 4-0 Champions League hammering by Chelsea on Tuesday. Congratulations to Mancini, it was a fantastic goal, though maybe 2-0 wasnt a fair reflection of the game, he said. For most of the evening there were two evenly balanced teams out there. Nil-nil would have been a fairer result. Lazios second loss in three Serie A matches leaves them in sixth place and in danger of losing touch with the leaders. Two goals from Peguy Luyindula helped Olympique Lyon shock title rivals Olympique Marseille 4-1 and keep the pressure on French Ligue 1 leaders Monaco on Sunday. Luyindulas goals, both scored from close range in each half, took Lyons unbeaten run to eight games and three successive victories. Djibril Cisse scored twice as AJ Auxerre beat En Avant Guingamp 3-0 to overtake Bulgarias Vladimir Manchev as the leading scorer in Ligue 1 with nine goals. (Reuters)  Copyright

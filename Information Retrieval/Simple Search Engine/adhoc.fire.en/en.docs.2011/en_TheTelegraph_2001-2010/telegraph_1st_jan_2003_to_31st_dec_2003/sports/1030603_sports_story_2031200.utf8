The BCCI has also formed a special committee  comprising Professor Ratnakar Shetty, M.P. Pandove, Niranjan Shah and Chitrak Mitra while Board joint secretary Jyoti Bajpai has been appointed convenor of the committee. Dalmiya said that in a move to unearth local talents from these areas, the NADP will kick off with under-17 and under-19 tournaments. The meets will not be limited-overs engagements as the Board is going to implement the spin stalwarts suggestion in a recent conclave of banning one-dayers till 17 years at domestic level, Dalmiya added. The BCCI president also announced a slew of measures, including involvement of expert coaches in the NADP project. Coaches will be picked from various zonal centres and even the National Cricket Academy, Dalmiya said. The BCCI will cough up all direct expenditures towards the talent search and coaching programmes, including conveyance and fees for the coaches and consultants, who will be sent to these areas to help prepare grounds and wickets, basic practice as well as ground equipment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anups 3 for Bengal school
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: A second-half hattrick by Anup Dutta enabled Kumar Ashutosh Institute of Dum Dum, Calcutta, end their Subroto Mukerjee Cup campaign on a winning note. In an inconsequential, preliminary league group IV match, they trounced Sainik School Imphal 5-0. The victory was of no avail, as Government High School, Dimapur, Nagaland, have already emerged group IV winners. They have gathered nine points and qualified for the quarter finals. The Bengal school champions finished with six points from three matches and finished second in their group. Kumar Ashutosh midfielder Parbinder Singh gave his team a ninth-minute lead and extended it in the 29th minute. Then, in the second half, it was lanky Anup all over, coming into the spotlight in a breezy fashion. He got his hattrick within a span of 22 minutes. In group V, the Maharashtra school champions, M.M. High School, Rabbani beat Guru Gobind Singh Khalsa High School, Jabalpur, 6-0. In another group V match, Good Shephered High School, Shillong, got the better of American College Higher Secondary School from Madurai, 2-0.  Copyright

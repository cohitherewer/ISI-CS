 Arjuna blames it on politics
Chennai: Former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga has identified political interference in cricket as the reason for Sri Lankas dip in performance and blamed the cricket board. There is political interference in selection and that is why we are going down and down, said Ranatunga Friday. The cricketer-turned-commentator was on his way to Mumbai for an exhibition match to raise funds for a philanthropic project by singer Lata Mangeshkar. Ranatunga attacked the Sri Lankan board for the fall in the teams performance. He said the Sri Lankan sports ministry was not doing anything and the interference in selection started in the past couple of years. About the teams performance in the World Cup, Ranatunga said: We are disappointed but we made mistakes too. We did not play well enough against the Australians in the semi-finals. Vice-captain of the team in South Africa, Mahela Jayawardene accepted that his poor form contributed to the teams indifferent performance. I am equally disappointed with my own form and the teams poor showing. Speaking about his exclusion from the Sharjah tournament he said: No player can complain on these aspects when he has not performed. Muttiah Muralidharan refused to accept that there was a big gap in standards between Australians and other top teams, especially in one-dayers. The gap is not big. It is just that the Aussies have maintained their winning habit and their confidence is high.  (PTI)  Copyright

 If Bangla can play Tests, so can Kenya: Patil
Johannesburg: Kenyas coach Sandeep Patil Tuesday insisted his team was ready to step into the Test arena after producing their second giant-killing feat in the World Cup. Kenya, who upset the West Indies in the 1996 World Cup, stunned Sri Lanka by 53 runs in Nairobi Monday to throw open the race for the Super Sixes. Patil, a former Indian Test batsman who has coached Kenya for the last five years, said the victory indicated his team was maturing to join the big league as the 11th Test-playing nation. I think we are getting there, Patil said Tuesday. To tell you the truth, if Bangladesh can play Test cricket, there is no reason why we cant. I think we are as good as them, if not better. Our time will come. Bangladesh, who were granted Test status in 2000, have been clearly out of their depth in the big league and many critics have questioned their elevation. The ICC, which is considering Kenyas application for Test status, does not want them to go the Bangladesh way. The experience of Bangladesh has shown that we need to be very careful , ICCs development manager Andrew Eade told BBC Online.  (AFP)  Copyright

 New-look Vasco start underdogs 
			Margao: A new-look Vasco Sports Club will be looking to brush aside poor performances in the local league when they take on new entrants Haywards 2000 Sporting at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, here Saturday. Hit hard by the inter-state transfers Vasco have lost as many as seven key players, leaving them a depleted side, the biggest loss being Marcos Parreira, who had switched to Mohun Bagan. With Rui Wanderley also not there, the Vasco attack has lost sting. However, they have acquired Brazilian Edson and Nigerian Amachi on loan from Hayward, with hopes pinned on them (the foreigners) to deliver the goods. Vasco have not performed well in the local league, finishing a poor sixth, but the win against ASEAN Cup and National League champions East Bengal in the Federation Cup, has shown that they have the potential to perform well in the NFL and are ready for the challenge, coach Derek Pereira said. We have performed well in the NFL, finishing third in the last two editions, and I have faith in our youngsters who are all geared up to perform their best, Pereira added. Making their maiden entry, Hayward want to prove that they are no pushovers and that they have a balanced side with good bench strength.  (PTI)  Copyright

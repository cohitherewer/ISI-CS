		 Thursday, January 30, 2003  Sourav: No problems playing in Zimbabwe
 Indian captain looking forward to  Pak encounter
 Johannesburg: The Indian  cricket team has no reservations about playing a World Cup  match in Zimbabwe, captain Saurav Ganguly said as the squad  arrived in South Africa for the tournament on Wednesday. India are due to play a group  game against Zimbabwe in Harare on February 19, one of six  matches to be staged in the country. We toured Zimbabwe  two years ago and it was okay for us then, Sourav told  a news conference shortly after the Indian squad arrived  at Johannesburg International Airport. We were looked after very well  then, so we have no reservations about going there now. Earlier this week, Englands players  asked the ICC to conduct an urgent review into their match  in Zimbabwe, citing growing concerns over the political  climate in the country. Sourav was confident his team  would improve on their poor performance on the recent tour  of New Zealand, where they were beaten 5-2 in a one-day  series. New Zealand was a good wake-up call and we are  here to bounce back. In professional sport phases come and  go. Teams come into form and get out of form.  Sourav added his side should not  be ruled out of contention. In one-day cricket, every team  is strong. One-day cricket is a matter of 50 overs a side  and as a rule you cannot write off any team, he said. We have come close on two occasions  after winning the World Cup in 1983. In 1987 and 1996 we  were beaten in the semi-finals. People consider that we  are a side capable of winning. Admitting that his team was under  tremendous pressure to do well, Sourav said, There are  similar pressure on countries such as South Africa and Australia  where cricket is a passion. Sourav said his team was determined  to put up a good show in the World Cup. The boys are keen  to put their heads down and work together to do well in  the World Cup. We need to play as a unit, and everyone  needs to perform, he said. A number of supporters and officials  of the Indian High Commission as also chairman of the World  Cup Organising Committee Ali Bacher were present at the  airport to receive the Indians.  From Johannesburg, the team drove  down to Durban where they will be based till the start of  the tournament on February 8. The team will play two warm-up  games against Kwa-Zulu Natal on February 4 and 6 in Durban.  A lot of people say we are in  a tough group but it all depends on what happens on a particular  day. Anyone can win the tournament. Sourav said his team  was totally focussed and not distracted by issues like the  contracts row. One of the most eagerly awaited  games of the tournament will be Indias clash with  Pakistan at Centurion on March 1, the first time the neighbouring  countries will meet since June 2000 when they played in  the Asia Cup in Dhaka. Were looking forward to meeting  them again, said Sourav. It will be good for people back  in India to watch the two teams meet. The game comes pretty  late so the Super Six places will probably already have  been decided. Its unlikely to be a crunch game. (REUTERS)

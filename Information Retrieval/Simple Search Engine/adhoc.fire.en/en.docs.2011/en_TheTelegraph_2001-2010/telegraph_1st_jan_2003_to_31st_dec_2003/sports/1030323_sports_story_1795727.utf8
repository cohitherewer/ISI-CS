 Teenagers ton thwarts India A
Bridgetown, March 22 (AP): Teenager Narsingh Deonarine hit a maiden first-class ton to lead the West Indies B to a formidable 324 for five against India A on the opening day of their rescheduled Carib Beer Series match Friday. India A captain V.V.S. Laxman is out of the key match with an injured back, while spinner Murali Kartik is absent due to a finger injury. Ajay Ratra is leading the team and they have to win this match to entertain hopes of making the semi-finals. Leg-spinner Amit Mishra fought hard for the tourists, claiming two for 85 from 23 overs. Fast bowlers Yohannan and Avishkar Salvi each took a wicket, as did part-time off-spinner A.T. Rayudu. Rayudu broke the blossoming fourth-wicket stand midway through the final session when Kanhai edged to first slip. The Trinidadian had joined Deonarine just after lunch after Jeffers was bowled by Mishra. Two Barbadians, Patrick Browne and Martin Nurse fell cheaply before the break, as Ratra won the toss and inserted the young West Indians. Barbados have secured a berth in next weekends semis with Guyana and Jamaica. India As battle is against Trinidad and Tobago, who have completed their preliminary matches. Brief scores  West Indies B 324/8 (Shane Jeffers 60, Narsingh Deonarine 100, Aneil Kanhai 64, Amit Mishra 2/85, Avishkar Salvi 1/77, Tinu Yohannan1/48) vs India A.  Copyright

 Kahn, Bayern stay united
Berlin: Bayern Munich captain Oliver Kahn is to stay with the German champions, despite being approached by Englands Manchester United, the goalkeeper said Friday. There have been a lot of rumours and a lot of speculation recently and there is always some truth to it, the German international said, when asked about reports he would move to Manchester. One thinks about it. But Im already playing for the best club in the world, so there are actually no need for thoughts like that anymore. One really has to think carefully about whether it makes sense to move on. Kahn, who had been linked to several other clubs, had said he was considering leaving Bayern even though the team insisted he would not be released before his contract expired in 2006. Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said in March he was worried Kahn might leave if he continued to face pressure from the media over his personal life. Kahn made headlines in Germany for weeks after admitting he had an affair with a barmaid while his wife was pregnant. Bayern officials have said they wanted Kahn, at the club since 1994, to end his playing career with them before moving into an administrative position.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Lehmann hits unbeaten156
 Darren Lehmann flicks one en route to his century on Saturday Cairns, July 26 (Agencies): A power-packed unbeaten century by left-hander Darren Lehmann powered Australia towards a mammoth total on the second day of the second Test against Bangladesh here Saturday. With Lehmann clobbering an unconquered 156 after hitting a century in the first Test in Darwin, the top-ranked side ended the day on 351 for three after dismissing Bangladesh for 295. Lehmann completed his third Test century from 130 balls. Lehmann, who faced 187 balls, figured in an unbroken stand of 219 with skipper Steve Waugh, who was unbeaten on 74. The fourth-wicket partnership snatched the initiative from Bangladesh, who had done well to restrict Australia to 132 for three earlier in the day. Lehmann leapt from 51 to 156 in the final session. He thus became the first Australian to score a hundred in a session since former captain Mark Taylor during his 334 not out against Pakistan in October 1998.  Copyright

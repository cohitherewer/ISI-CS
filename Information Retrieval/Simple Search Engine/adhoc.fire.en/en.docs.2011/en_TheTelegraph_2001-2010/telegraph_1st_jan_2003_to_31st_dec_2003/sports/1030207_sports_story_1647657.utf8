The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak suffer 26-run loss
Benoni: Pakistans much vaunted bowling attack showed lack of discipline as they went down by 26 runs in their last World Cup warm-up match against Easterns Thursday. Pakistan conceded 40 extras, including 14 wides and 10 no balls, and were docked four overs for a slow over-rate as the Easterns made 215 for nine in 50 overs. Pakistan, in reply, were shot out for 189 in 36.4 overs. Pierre de Bruyn put in a sterling all-round show, making 41 and taking four for 40. A worried Pakistan coach Richard Pybus said his bowlers needed to work on their line and length. It was disappointing to have conceded so many extras and the bowlers need to work overtime to alter their length, Pybus said. Shahid Afridi (46) and Abdul Razzaq (44) were the only bright spots in the Pakistan batting performance. Meanwhile, world champions Australia beat Northerns by five-wickets in their last warm-up match at Centurion. Jimmy Maher (78n.o.) and Adam Gilchrist (71) were in smashing form as the Aussies chased a commendable 277 set up by the Northerns with ease. For the losers, Jack Rudolph, played a superb innings of 150 while Brett Lee (4/28) did a splendid job for the Australians. In other matches, New Zeland, Engalnd, Sri Lanka had it easy in their final tune-up to the quadrennial show-piece. While South Africa beat Western Provionce by 92 runs, Sri Lanka beat Free State by five wickets. England, aided by a superb unbeaten 81 by opener Nick Knight eased past Borders by eight wickets.

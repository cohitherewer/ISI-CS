The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 No decision on final postponement
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The winners of the TVS Fiero IFA Shield, which gets underway Thursday, will be richer by Rs 6 lakh. The runners-up will get Rs 3 lakh and the losing semi-finalists will receive Rs 75,000 each.																								At a press conference Sunday, IFA joint-secretary Ranjit Gupta informed ESPN will cover 11 of the 12 matches. The telecast can be seen in three capsules of 30 minute each.																								The final, slated for January 20, may be postponed by a day. The IFA is trying to defer it by a day at least, since it comes off just a day after the semi-finals, but a decision is still awaited, maybe, keeping in view the Presidents brief trip to the city.																								Gupta added the association got confirmation from four foreign outfits but it was of no avail because of the AFC ban on hosting international teams.

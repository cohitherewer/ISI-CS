Action in the fifth round saw a number of upsets once again.

He had held the 2nd seed, Akshat Khamparia of Madhya Pradesh on Thursday. In yet another upset, 11-year-old Debanjan Das of Jadavpur Vidyapith, ranked 53rd, overcame Fide-rated Souvik Chakraborty of Narmada HS in an interesting endgame where both sides had a rook and two pawns. Payel Guha, ranked 57, of Holy Child Girls School made short work of 24th seed Fide-rated Ashish Kumar of Jamshedpur in just 27 moves. Defending champion Joydeep Dutta of Kumar Ashutosh Institution received a jolt as he was held by Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar of Bangladesh in 23 moves in a centre-counter gambit. National sub-junior girls champion Mary Ann Gomes of Frank Correa Academy had little difficulty with the black pieces to dispose off Indradeep Giri of Uttarpara Government High School in the Najdorf variation of the Sicilian defence.

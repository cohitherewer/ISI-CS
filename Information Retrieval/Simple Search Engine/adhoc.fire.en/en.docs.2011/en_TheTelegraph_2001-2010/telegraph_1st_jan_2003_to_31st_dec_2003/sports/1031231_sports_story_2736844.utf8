The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Diligent Lankans prevail in final
 - ASIAN A CHAMPIONSHIP - Lax Indians pay the price after poor batting display  BY INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Russel Arnold with the trophy at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta  INDIA A 197 (44.4 ovs)
 SRI LANKA A 198/3 (33.4 ovs)
 MoM: Pervez Maharoof
 MoS: Russel Arnold Calcutta: The resistance  was meek, the surrender even more pathetic. For a side,  which boasts of wide experience, to be humiliated by a bunch  of rookies does call for some soul searching. Simply put, the Indians did not deserve to win the Kenstar Asian A Championship final at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. Their batting lacked application, the fielding was sloppy and the bowling did not have the discipline and penetration to put it across the visitors. To make matters worse, the hosts lost their last five wickets for 15 runs and within a span of 28 balls. The inability to play the full quota of overs spoke volumes of the batsmens ineptitude. All India needed was another 50-odd runs to keep the contest alive. Sri Lankan skipper Russel Arnold put it well in the end: There seemed to be more effort in our guys. Three of the four players picked for the one-day series Down Under played and their performance read thus  Sanjay Bangar 26, Hemang Badani 23 and Yuvraj Singh 18. It surely couldnt have been showcased had the selectors decided to pick the squad after the final. The conditions did favour swing but the way Bangar succumbed to the moving ball was not encouraging. His footwork lax, he was often found wanting in the corridor of uncertainty. Having survived once, he nicked while slashing outside the off stump. Badani, too, never looked in control. He was struggling to pick the gaps, the timing was not perfect and even his shot selection was injudicious. He, though, was victim of an unfortunate decision, the ball appearing to kiss the pads on way to the wicketkeepers gloves. Yuvraj started off in whirlwind fashion and paid the price for trying to hit every ball. Such indiscretion from an experienced customer is never expected and should come as a good encouragement for the Aussies. Dinesh Mongia fared no better and never showed the responsibility expected from a veteran. Amid all this, Sridharan Sriram showed the determination and attitude needed to build the innings. The left-hander, who played his first match of the tournament, was all focussed but found very little support at the other end. His 65 (82 balls, 4x4) was a reward for his concentration and resolve to carve out the runs. Srirams unlucky dismissal  he was found short of his crease at the non-strikers end following bowler Rangana Heraths brilliant stop and flick back to the stumps  led to the late-order slump. The batsman, who has scored runs by the tons in domestic cricket, surely deserves more exposure and opportunities. Ajay Ratra was also a disappointment. After getting himself involved in another run out after Srirams, he failed to keep the scoreboard moving and wasted 42 deliveries in scoring 15. Having had a Test century under his belt, it was only desirable that he showed better sense in accumulating some runs and guiding his partners. If the Lankan bowling was spot-on, the fielding was brilliant. They seemed supremely fit on the field and the Indians found it tough to match their enthusiasm. The bowling, too, wasnt far behind. Nuwan Zoysa was economical and Man-of-the-Match Pervez Maharoof was devastating in his two spells. First, he removed Bangar and then came back to knock off the tail. His teasing off-stump line proved too hot to handle for the batsmen and he varied his pace intelligently. The visiting batsmen then ensured that their bowlers efforts did not go waste. The Indians dropped a couple of easy catches and the bowling never looked threatening. In fact, the pacers never managed to get the early breakthroughs to make the task of the spinners easier. Jehan Mubarrak (61) and P. Jayawardene (54) stitched together a 104-run partnership for the second wicket in 99 balls and virtually sealed Indias fate. The bowlers could have done very little as the battle was lost in the first session itself. The Asian A Championship title went to the side that deserved it.  Copyright

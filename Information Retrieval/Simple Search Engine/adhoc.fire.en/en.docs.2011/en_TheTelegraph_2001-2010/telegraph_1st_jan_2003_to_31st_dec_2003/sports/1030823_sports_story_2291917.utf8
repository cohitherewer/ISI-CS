 BCB draws Rameez flak
Islamabad: Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Rameez Raja has lashed out at the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for sacking Pakistani coach Mohsin Kamal following Bangladeshs poor performance in the World Cup early this year. Rameez said during the ongoing Test match between Pakistan and Bangladesh in Karachi that the BCB should have treated Kamal with more respect than unceremoniously sacking and putting the entire blame on him. Kamal should have been treated with respect by the BCB. If they wanted to sack him they shouldve done it in a respectable way instead of firing him the way they did, Rameez said. Bangladesh did not perform well in the World Cup and one can understand the disappointment of the people, but it wasnt fair to only hold Kamal responsible for the debacle.  (PTI)  Copyright

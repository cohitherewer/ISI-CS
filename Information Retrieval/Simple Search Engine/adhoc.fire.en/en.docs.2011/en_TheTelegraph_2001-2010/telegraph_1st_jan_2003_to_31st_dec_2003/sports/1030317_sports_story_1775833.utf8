The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Waiting for colour after Super 6 toil
 - The tournament began with a day-night  spectacular. Things then went downhill fast PALE CRICKET: File  picture of Sri Lankan players enjoying a rare moment  of true triumph  Johannesburg: Whisper it  quietly, and especially out of Ali Bachers earshot, but  what chance of a Sri Lanka-Kenya World Cup final? For tournament executive director  Ali Bacher and the event organisers, for sponsors and for  many cricket aficionados, that prospect would represent  the worst of all possible worlds. They would argue that South Africa  2003 desperately needs to be resuscitated with a high-quality,  big-name, nail-biting final. That can only mean one thing:  Australia, the best side on the planet by several leagues,  versus India, a fine improving side boasting both the games  best batsman and, as importantly, the worlds biggest T-shirt,  sun-hat, soft-drink purchasing fan-base imaginable. Sachin Tendulkar versus Brett  Lee would sell more than Maravan Atapattu versus Martin  Suji. Everybody wants to watch the awesome Australians,  even if through gritted teeth and a determination to cheer  for the opposition. And if India make the final, one  billion people, give or take a half-dozen eccentrics who  prefer hockey or kabaddi  will watch the final. There will be no New Delhi government  meetings on March 23. Even the border checkpoints with Pakistan  will be deserted. If Kenya, the first non-Test side  to make the last four, somehow continue the fairytale and  sneak past India in their Durban day-nighter on March 20,  there will be a lot less to enthuse about. Kenyas popularity may have risen  since they failed to find a sponsor before the event but  even now it is still hard to name one of their players who  sets pulse rates racing. Sri Lanka in the final? They are  a colourful side but have been playing pale cricket in South  Africa, losing to India by 183 runs and to Australia by  96. They even lost to Kenya. Bacher, of course, crickets incorrigible  optimist, would declare himself delighted with a Sri Lanka-Kenya  final  in public at least  arguing cricket needs drama  and globalisation. But it would represent a wretched  conclusion to a tournament already blighted by controversy. First there were those months  of labyrinthine arguments over player sponsorship rights   the Indians even threatened to stay away until they forced  the ICC into a series of compromises. Then came the politics and the  match forfeits over security concerns in Zimbabwe and Kenya. There was even the sight of two  black-armbanded Zimbabwean players, Andy Flower and Henry  Olonga, one white, one black, protesting over their governments  human rights record. Both retired after the teams last  game with emigration on their minds. The real problem with South Africa  2003, however, dramatic as it has been, has been simple   a lack of great cricket. Only Australia and, in the latter  stages, India have delivered consistently. The tournament began with a day-night  spectacular, as former champions West Indies beat South  Africa by three runs in Cape Town. Brian Lara scored a dazzling  century. Things then went downhill fast.  One-day cricket thrives on close games but there have been  precious few of those. Worse still, West Indies, winners  in 1975 and 1979, Pakistan, the 1992 victors, England and  then the hosts failed to reach the second round. Interest in the tournament in  South Africa  already burdened with 25 out of 40 games  in the first round involving at least one minnow side   plummeted accordingly. Even the dramatic upsets  Kenya  beating Sri Lanka and then Zimbabwe to reach the semi-finals  were tense rather than high quality.  The pitches, tired and slow and  low after a long South African season, have not helped. Not one of the Super Six games  even suggested a close finish. The victory margins tell  the story  96 runs, six wickets, six wickets, 183 runs,  96 runs, seven wickets, seven wickets, 74 runs and five  wickets. Of course, it is ridiculous to  presume that Kenya could possibly beat India or Sri Lankan  dismiss Australia. Pigs would fly. (REUTERS) Copyright

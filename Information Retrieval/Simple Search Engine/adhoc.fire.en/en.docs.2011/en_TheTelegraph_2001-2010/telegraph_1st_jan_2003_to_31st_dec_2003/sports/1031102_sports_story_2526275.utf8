 Goodwin escapes with reprimand
Melbourne, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Former Zimbabwe Test batsman Murray Goodwin escaped with a reprimand on Saturday after pleading guilty to breaching Cricket Australias (CA) Code of Behaviour. Goodwin, who plays for Western Australia, earned 19 Test caps before quitting international cricket in 2000 and helped Sussex win their first county championship this summer. The 30-year-old was charged by the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) under Rule 9 of Section 1 of the code for making detrimental public comment regarding the selection process of the Zimbabwe Test team. He suggested that race played a part in such selection, Cricket Australia (CA) Code of Behaviour commissioner Alan Sullivan said in a statement. Goodwins comments, which came on the eve of last months two-Test series between Australia and Zimbabwe, were inappropriately timed and potentially harmful to the interests of cricket, Sullivan said. Goodwins case was due to be heard in Sydney today but the player entered a guilty plea on Friday.  Copyright

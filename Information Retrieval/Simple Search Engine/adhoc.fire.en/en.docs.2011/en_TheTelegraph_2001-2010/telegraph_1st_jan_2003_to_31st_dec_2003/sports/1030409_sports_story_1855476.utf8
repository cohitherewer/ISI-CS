 Tollygunge Agragami clinch title
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunge Agragami savour their victory over Tapan Memorial at the Eden Gardens Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: For Ashok Malhotra, age hardly appears an impediment in pursuing a career in local cricket. His 41 of 52 balls for Tapan Memorial could not lead his team to the CAB Knock-out Trophy at Eden Gardens on Tuesday. But the way he mixed caution with aggression in his innings lent enough credence to the fact that hes still a force to be reckoned with, who can make his teammates and other local aspirants run for their money. In the end, Tollygunge proved too strong for their rivals in ensuring their first major success in local cricket since 1998-1999 when they won both the CAB league and Knock-out meets. Batting first, Arindam Das (69) and Kunal Bajpayee (54) set up a perfect beginning for Tollygunge with a 109-run stand, before Devang Gandhi (67 not out) and Avijit Ganguly (35) put up a challenging total of 246 in 45 overs. Tapan Memorial got off to a bad start having lost their openers inside 24 runs. Malhotra and later Yadav tried to put his team back on track, but in vain, once the asking rate started soaring as their innings drew closer. BRIEF SCORES Tollygunge Agragami 246/4 in 45 ovs (Arindam Das 69, Devang Gandhi 67 n.o., Kunal Bajpayee 54; Sumit Dogra 2/41). Tapan Memorial 217/8 in 45 ovs (Vishal Yadav 55 n.o., Ashok Malhotra 41; Rajib Dutta 3/37, Abhinas Kumar 2/35). Tollygunge Agragami won by 29 runs.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The more I see of Bhaichung, the more fascinated I get: Bhowmick
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Subhas Bhowmick 				 	Not that Subhas Bhowmick has ever had much time to spare but, after the ASEAN Club Championship success, even a 48-hour day may not be enough. Despite heavy demands, the 53-year-old former India international and current East Bengal coach spoke to The Telegraph for about an hour-and-half at his New Alipore residence late on Wednesday. The following are excerpts  Q East Bengals ASEAN victory is being seen  as more than just a clubs success. What are your thoughts?  A I quite agree with such a sentiment... Having  said that, let me add a good many sports have potential.  Whats lacking is proper marketing. Soccer, too, isnt being  sold as it ought to be. Unless the marketing is professional,  neither the corporate sector nor even the public will be  very enthused  certainly not for long.  How confident were you of East Bengal returning  with the trophy?  To be honest, I was looking to make the semis. In  fact, on the eve of our departure for Jakarta, the hugely  supportive (UB Group supremo) Mr Vijay Mallya asked whether  we would make the quarters. I responded by promising a semis  berth. He then said he would cheer the team in person if  we actually got there. He couldnt make it for the semis,  but was very much there when we won the championship.  What made you promise a semis berth?  (Emotionally) The players hunger to succeed,  the fire they had within themselves I hadnt seen anything  like it before from such close quarters. Moreover, I could  see that more and more players were gaining in self-belief  From Bhaichung Bhutia to Dipak Mondal, Douglas da Silva  and Mike Okoro, Alvito DCunha to Debjit Ghosh  Did you live and die with each penalty during the  semis shootout (versus Petrokimia Putra)?  It was down to that chance or luck factor Nobody  had to remind me of that Yet, having come through the closing  minutes of regulation time (and the half-hour extra session)  with just ten players, I was hopeful of  You insist you arent a man of emotions. Still,  you must have felt something at the long blast last Saturday?  I thanked God and, for a while, went blank I got  off the bench and moved towards the dressing room Later,  many thoughts crowded my mind I looked at our win as a  step towards getting people to take note of soccer I thought  wed won a battle in the larger war for recognition I also  reflected on the mistakes Id made (in the final) and began  thinking of areas where we needed to get better.  What did you tell the boys on the eve of the final  (against the highly-rated BEC Tero Sasana)?  Enjoy the moment and dont be obsessed with the trophy  Dont do an Ivan Lendl, whose obsession with trying to win  Wimbledon made him forget his tennis Indeed, as nobody  had predicted we would get so far, the boys were already  winners I added that if you can teach the opponents a thing  or two, teach well. Equally, if you need to learn, learn  well.  To what extent should kudos be directed at a coach?  Look, a coach can only contribute a maximum of ten  per cent But, yes, that ten per cent is crucial because  he controls the productivity and non-productivity.  In soccer, the coach/manager is king. Doesnt that  put him under more pressure than the players?  Absolutely What needs to be remembered is that the  finished product cant be good if the raw materials arent  of a high quality Speaking of the coach, he has to respond  promptly  as soccer is such an instant-sport  if the oppositions  strategy is different from what was envisaged Unless that  response is prompt, the outcome will be disastrous. (After  a pause) For instance, I had to redraw plans during  the break in the semis The saying that a coach earns his  salary at half-time is so true. Clearly, for a coach, the  thinking process doesnt stop.  Who is an ideal coach?  Somebody who is technically sound, knows how to cut  the coat according to the cloth at his disposal and, well,  is patient. Also, he must have the ability to get all the  players to talk in the same language and ought not to let  them down publicly. As man-management is a key element,  he must appreciate which players dont like being rebuked  publicly and which players only get going after getting  the stick! (After a pause) Today, I confess I was  impatient in my first stint as East Bengals coach. Thats  the top reason why I wasnt successful.  Does a coach have a shelf-life?  Yes. Just as the body, after a while, becomes immune  to an antibiotic, the players can become immune to a coach  Have you had a role model-coach?  P.K Banerjee 				 	The PK Banerjee of old The time  I was a player and he had a dream Besides being on the  ball technically and tactically, he was a terrific motivator  and Ive tried to imitate him I dont have a degree (in  coaching), but interacting with PK was such an education.  Any overseas-influence, so to say?  When the last (2002) World Cup got underway, I was  quite fascinated by Argentinas Marcelo Bielsa I couldnt  forget his quote about sleepless nights and constantly inventing  tactics He regarded himself a scientist But, as the tournament  warmed-up, I began being impressed by the then Brazil coach,  Felipe Scolari I realised his tactics were more useful  and, as it turned out, Brazil won the World Cup I keep  myself open to ideas and have studied Hollands Rinus Michels  total-football approach. (After a pause) Ive looked  at the functioning of coaches in other sports as well.  Is it true you wanted to quit even after East Bengals  phenomenal run last season?  I wasnt getting that job satisfaction and, so, was  toying with the idea. However, a well-wisher suggested I  focus on the ASEAN meet and the AFC Champions League  Obviously, Kevin Jacksons recruitment (as trainer)  has made a huge difference  (Laughs) Its a long story I think it was  during the (2002) NatWest Trophy that I got a shock on seeing  Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar All the fat had gone  On learning that trainer Adrian le Roux made the difference,  I sought an appointment during the West Indies Test at the  Eden (last October-November) We interacted for about three  hours and I requested a month of his time this summer. Later,  he called and suggested Kevins name. Initially, I thought  we wouldnt be able to pay $ 1,000 per week but, thankfully,  our sponsors quickly gave the go-ahead. I was desperate  to get him as we, Indians, have this bad habit of not listening  to one of our own. The attitude changes when somebody from  overseas offers the same advice. Now, my players food habits  have changed and they want fruits instead of singharas.  What have you learnt in your years as coach?  More than anything else, to be patient With experience,  Ive also learnt to be flexible with tactics.  Any lessons from Jakarta?  I wouldnt say Ive specifically learnt something,  but weve gained in confidence Now, our self-belief is  more pronounced. If I can draw a parallel, the victory in  Jakarta is probably like the Indian cricket teams win in  the Berbice one-dayer (1983) Beating the West Indies on  their own home turf, for the first time, gave us the confidence  to defeat them in the World Cup final not many months later  If we keep improving and are powered by self-belief, we  can beat the best across Asia.  Surely, there are lessons from the build-up to  the ASEAN meet Camping in the five-star Hyatt, getting  Jackson on board  I agree and, just as important, the attitude of certain  people must change. Unfortunately, our staying at the Hyatt  had become a joke in some quarters I couldnt believe it  Therefore, for Indian soccer to move forward, its essential  to first think differently (After a pause, emotionally)  Among other things, staying at the Hyatt and availing of  the excellent facilities allowed my players to project a  different body-language. It helped, too, that Reebok supplied  our kit I mean, on and off the field, East Bengal were  on a par with the other teams. Mentally, then, my boys were  ready for the kill... Did I specifically ask for Hyatt?  No  but, yes, I wanted the players to get out of the guest  house culture. Because of the constraints it wasnt easy,  but we eventually got a handsome deal Looking ahead, Mr  Mallya has already okayed an air-conditioned dressing room  (at the club) and a jacuzzi. Today, a hi-tech gym is my  only demand.  How do you judge whether somebody is or isnt professional?  (Interrupting) I believe the individual should  judge himself. Has he done enough? Has he trained sincerely?  Has he kept a goal in mind? Frankly, for me, attitude is  more important than skill and, before we picked the ASEAN  squad, I told everybody that only the right attitude would  ensure that Jakarta-ticket. (After a pause) Its  because of attitude that Sangram Mukherjee lost his No.  1 goalies position I gave Sandip Nandy a chance and the  rest is history  Did you strike the Bhaichung-deal?  Bhaichung				 	Not the deal, but I did make the  first move when he called Rennedy Singh on his cell in my  presence Bhaichungs initial response was that I would  be inviting (Mohun Bagans) enmity. I said I was prepared  and, of course, added I needed him. Later, I quietly met  Bhaichung in Guwahati and his coming back to East Bengal  became more certain.  Is Bhaichung the finest Indian footballer youve  seen?  Not the most talented, but certainly the toughest  in the mind That boy is remarkable and I keep telling my  players they should treat him as their role model... Theres  much to learn from Bhaichung. Really, the more I see of  him, the more fascinated I get.  Are you disappointed he will be away for two months,  in Malaysia?  Far from it Ive encouraged him to have that short-term  contract with Perak FC. All these years, weve been looking  for players from overseas. Now, teams from beyond India  are interested in our players. Its a matter of pride. (After  a pause) Even Sur Kumar Singh and Okoro may, for a while,  go elsewhere.  Finally, are you aspiring to coach the national  side?  Havent thought about it Im focussed on the job  in hand.  Copyright

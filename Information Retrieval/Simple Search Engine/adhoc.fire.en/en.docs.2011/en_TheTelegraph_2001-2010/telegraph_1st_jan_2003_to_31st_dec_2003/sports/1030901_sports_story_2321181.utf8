The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stint abroad was key
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Soma (above) and  Saraswati believe constant international exposure is  essential for success Calcutta: Anju Bobby Georges world championships bronze wouldnt have been possible had she not trained abroad, say her India teammates. They dont doubt her talent and ability, but quickly add the most important factor has been her training stint in the US. Exposure has been the key. She got the chance to train in the best place possible, as far as athletics is concerned, and availed of modern equipment and facilities, noted Sarswati Saha, the reigning Asian Games 200m champion. Soma Biswas, the Asian Games 4x400m relay gold winner and a silver medallist in heptathlon, doesnt differ. Training overseas for a significant period of time made the difference. She has always been good, but the US stint has added that extra bit. Soma, Sraswati and Anju were in the 2002 Asian Games squad, where Indian athletes, especially women, performed exceedingly well. Anjus event was on the first day. Her gold inspired us all to give of our best, recalled Soma. Saraswati, currently in Patiala for the ATF preparatory camp, feels Anju has gained from the competitions in Europe. Those meets are invaluable in terms of assessing ones own ability and work on shortcomings. Needless to add that rubbing shoulders with the best makes you sharper. The sprinter thinks Anju is naturally gifted. Look at her height and physique. Thats a great asset. To her credit, she has made good use of these and prepared herself. It takes loads of hard work and devotion, mind you. Soma adds that Anju stands out for her focus as well. She is very sensitive about her own performance. Not all athletes are as focussed, observed Soma, Anjus room partner in SAI, Patiala, in the Nineties. Soma and Saraswati think that Anjus has largely been an individual effort. Ive heard that the Tamil Nadu government helped her financially, but she also spent from her pocket. Her enterprise and the will to do well cant be overlooked, said Soma. Government help, good coaching, sophisticated training, international exposure, all that is fine. But Anjus credit lies in the fact that she prepared herself to make maximum use of everything, said Saraswati. Both Soma and Saraswati felt Anjus jump beyond the barrier will encourage others to aim higher. Our dreams are largely confined to the Asian Games but Anju has shown the horizon can be broader. Its an eye-opener, really, said Soma. PTI adds: Encomiums, from all parts of the country, are pouring in. The following are excerpts of what some of the former stars had to say:  MILKHA SINGH: It  is a superb performance that shows Indians can do well at  the global level. Hard work and exposure abroad helped her  win the medal. Anjus success is a lesson for Indians who  yearn for distinction.  T.C. YOHANAN: Anju has come  up with a wonderful performance, for which credit should  be given to her initiative and the backing of officials  for her training stint with Mike Powell.  G.S. RANDHAWA: More than training with  Powell, it was competing in Europe before this meet that  made the difference. She had been consistently nearing 6.70m  and I was expecting a medal. If she trains systematically,  she can win a medal in Athens. She has to improve on her  run and keep competing in high class competitions.  Copyright

 Musharraf calls for resumption
- Bilateral Cricket ties  London: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf renewed the call for resumption of cricketing ties between India and Pakistan on Friday. Musharraf, who arrived here Tuesday, watched the second one-day International here at The Oval which Pakistan lost by seven wickets.It is unfortunate that we are not playing cricket, Musharraf, the patron of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), told a television channel. Not only is it damaging the cause of cricket around the world, it is damaging the standard of cricket between the two countries as well.The last bilateral series took place in 1999, when Pakistan toured India. However, India played Pakistan in the World Cup in southern Africa in March this year. One would like to get back the world championship to the region, therefore we are doing harm to cricket in both the countries, Musharraf said.Musharraf also encouraged other teams to visit Pakistan. Bangladesh will be there for three Tests and five one-day Internationals in August, marking the return of international cricket to the country.A number of countries have cancelled tours of Pakistan in the recent past due to fears concerning terrorism.Weve performed exceptionally well on anti-terrorist campaigns, said Musharraf. Pakistan is a very, very safe place.The cricket countries of the world must understand that theres no problem in cricket on the law and order issue  total security is guaranteed. And they must come and play in Pakistan.  Copyright

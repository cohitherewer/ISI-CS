The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB held, Bagan lose
 - National League - Douglas injured, out of JCT game 
 Dipankar equalised for East Bengal Margao: A brilliant performance by keeper Rogerio Ramos helped Vasco hold East Bengal 1-1 in an 8th National Football League match at the Nehru Stadium on Thursday. The Vasco midfield combined well and surged ahead in the 82nd minute when striker Amaechi Tochukwus powerful header off a Kamal Thapa flag kick kept Nandy rooted as the ball deflected off the post to find the net. East Bengal, who dominated the entire second half, restored parity a minute later. Suley Musah, who often moved up, sent a pass to Bhaichung Bhutia, who back-heeled the ball, to fox the rival defence. Substitute Dipankar Roy, who was standing near the goal, pounced on the loose ball to tap home. Vasco, who had more of the ball possession, played more back passes that helped the rival defence to regroup. Ramos brought off some good saves to prevent a Vasco loss in Goa. East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick was disappointed with his strikers Bhutia and Mike Okoro. If they continue to miss such opportunities we will find it difficult to defend the title, he said. [Meanwhile, Douglas Da Silva has aggravated the injury on his right leg and has been ruled out for the next game against JCT in Ludhiana, A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds. He was tried for 20 minutes on Thursday but could not carry on and had to be replaced.] In Mumbai, Mohun Bagan lost 1-2 to Mahindra United at the Cooperage. Mahindras James Singh put them ahead in the 55th minute with a fine floater following a free kick from the top of the box. Twenty minutes later Bagan captain and striker Jose Ramirez Barreto equalised off mid-fielder Rocus Lamare. However, just four minutes later Mahindra striker Felix Aboagye put his team ahead again.

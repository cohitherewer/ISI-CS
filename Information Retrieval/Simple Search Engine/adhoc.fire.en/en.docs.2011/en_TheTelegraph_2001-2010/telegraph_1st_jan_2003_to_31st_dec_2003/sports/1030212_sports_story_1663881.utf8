 ZCU reports Flower, Olonga to ICC
 Johannesburg: Zimbabwe players Andy Flower and Henry Olonga, who launched a scathing attack on President Robert Mugabe and his government Monday, have been reported to the ICC by their own national cricket board. They have been reported to the ICCs technical committee by the ZCU (Zimbabwe Cricket Union), an ICC spokesman said. However, I can give no specific time for when the hearing is to take place. Former skipper Flower and pace bowler Olonga made a protest  a silent plea to those responsible to stop the abuse of human rights in Zimbabwe  moments before Zimbabwes opening World Cup game against Namibia at Harare Sports Club. They could face a charge of bringing the game into disrepute. The pair could also be sanctioned for wearing black armbands as part of their protest. ZCU chairman Peter Chingoka said: We havent suspended anyone. We have handed the matter over to the ICC technical committee. Its an ICC tournament and they need to handle the issue. Flower, arguably Zimbabwes greatest player ever and among the top batsmen in the world, is not expected to play a major event for Zimbabwe again. He played county cricket in England last year and is expected to return next season. Olonga was the first black player to play for Zimbabwe.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

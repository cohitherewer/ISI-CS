		 Wednesday, January 08, 2003 				 Thrilling to be back, says Agassi
				 	 Agassi																								Melbourne: Lean and crackling with energy, Andre Agassi is back in Australia with just one thing on his mind.																								The three-time Open champion is hitting form, feeling comfortable and right at home as he sets about another tilt at the Australian crown. 																								One more singles victory for the 32-year-old would make him the only overseas player to bag four mens singles titles and only the brave or the foolhardy would back against him.																								To be back is a thrill for me. The moment I landed I felt excited and comfortable and eager to go, the world number two said Tuesday. Thats a good thing.																								As the mercury soars in Melbourne, Agassis strict off-season regime begins to pay dividends at the first Grand Slam of the year  and this year should prove no different.																								For me, not living out of a suitcase for any period of time is holiday enough, the American said of the time spent between the Masters Cup in November and his arrival in Australia last week. I have to do something every day... I didnt take time off, I just took time away from the tennis court.																								For Agassi, doing something entails working out at the gym and pushing himself on runs near his Las Vegas home. 																								It is important for me to be strong and healthy, he added.																								I have got to keep pushing myself physically  it is all I can really count on.																								Certainly Agassis fitness will give him the edge over many competitors his junior when the Open kicks off Monday.																								A wrist injury caused him to miss last years event when he would have been gunning for three in a row. This year, he says he is just happy to be competing. I have always enjoyed playing here, he told reporters at a news conference ahead of the Kooyong Classic  the traditional Australian Open warm-up event at the former Open venue.																								The courts are playing well and I am looking forward to it. For me, if my game is feeling good and I am feeling fresh then I like the way I feel out there. (REUTERS)

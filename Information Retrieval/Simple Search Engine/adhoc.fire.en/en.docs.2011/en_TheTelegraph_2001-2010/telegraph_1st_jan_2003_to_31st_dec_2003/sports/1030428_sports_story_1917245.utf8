 El Aynaoui pulls out
Munich: Defending champion Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco and German Nicolas Kiefer have pulled out of the Munich Open tournament starting on Monday. Organisers of the claycourt event said on Sunday that El Aynaoui was weakened by a virus while Kiefer was hampered by back problems. German Tommy Haas pulled out earlier because of a shoulder problem. Top seed Roger Federer of Switzerland leads the field while local hopes rest on Australian Open runner-up Rainer Schuettler. The two will not be in action until Tuesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

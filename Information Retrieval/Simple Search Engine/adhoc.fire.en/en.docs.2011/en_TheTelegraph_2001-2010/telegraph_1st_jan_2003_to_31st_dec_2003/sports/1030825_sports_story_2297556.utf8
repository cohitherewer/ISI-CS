 The Warnes fly out of Australia 
 Warne is London bound amid reports of another sex scandal Melbourne: Banned Australian cricketer Shane Warne has flown out of Australia with his family  reportedly bound for London  amid reports that another woman will make claims of a sex scandal involving him. Warne, wife Simone and their children left Melbournes Tullamarine Airport last night bound for London, Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio reported on Sunday. He left two days before exotic dancer Angela Gallagher was due to be seen on television making claims about a three-month liaison with Warne, who is in the middle of a 12-month suspension for using a banned diuretic. Gallagher, 38, a mother of two, told her story to channel 7. The programme is expected to be aired on Monday night. Gallagher claims Warne pursued and romanced her with mobile phone messages of a sexual nature she described as pretty full-on. The latest accusation follows those made by South African Helen Cohen Alon that Warne had sent her lewd text messages. Warne refused to field questions or talk about his private life. At this stage any issues or allegations concerning my private life are exactly that  they are private and I will not be making any further comment on those issues or any such issues, Warne said. His wife Simone said she would stand by her husband. Certain individuals are trying to destroy our family. This will not happen, she said. Three years ago, Warne lost his vice-captaincy after admitting he made similar calls to a British nurse. On Friday, Warne said he was going into self-imposed cricket exile and would withdraw from all official training until his drug ban ends in February.  (AP)  Copyright

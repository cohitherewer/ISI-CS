 Team will miss le Roux: Sachin
 Sachin says le Roux had a positive influence Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar said on Monday that the Indian team would miss South African physical trainer Adrian le Roux as he had a positive influence on the team which reflected in its overall performance. In a sudden move, le Roux quit his post on Sunday to take up a similar job with his national team. Tendulkar said the teams overall fitness level had improved, that too in short time, and le Roux should be given the credit. He had different sets of exercises for each player and within a short time the players fitness improved dramatically which reflected in the overall performance of the team. Obviously we will miss him, he said. In fact, he personally saw to it that each and every member of the team went through the exercises scheduled for him and all of us felt the fitness level increase to a great extent, Tendulkar said. When asked about le Rouxs decision to quit and take up a two-year contract with South Africa, Tendulkar said: Well, it is his decision and we have to live with it. Anybody would be privileged to serve his own country and there is nothing wrong in Adrian opting to serve as the trainer of the South African team, he said. On his recent finger operation, Tendulkar said he would be totally fit for the home series against New Zealand in October. There is no pain now and the operation on my ring finger was a success. However, I will have to go through the rehabilitation process  pressing tennis ba-lls and other finger exercises  for the next three months, he added.  (PTI)  Copyright

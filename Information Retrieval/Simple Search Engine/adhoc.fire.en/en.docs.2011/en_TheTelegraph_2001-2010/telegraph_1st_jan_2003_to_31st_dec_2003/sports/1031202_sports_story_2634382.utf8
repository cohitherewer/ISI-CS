The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India, Pak grouped together
London: Pakistan and India were drawn in the same group alongside Kenya on Monday for the International Cricket Councils 12-team Champions Trophy to be held in England in September 2004. Pakistan avoided a match-up with the hosts thanks to their victory over New Zealand on Monday which meant they retained third spot in the official ICC one-day International table. Defeat against New Zealand would have seen Pakistan drop to fourth place. For the first time in the tournaments history, the seedings for the competition are based on the official ODI ratings with the cut-off date set for Monday. The new rule means fifth-placed England will have an opportunity to avenge the recent ODI defeat to Sri Lanka, who are fourth, and will also meet ninth-placed Zimbabwe for the second time in succession in the meet.  GROUPINGS Pool 1: Australia, New Zealand, qualifier (winner of ICC Six Nations Challenge) Pool 2: South Africa, West Indies, Bangladesh Pool 3: Pakistan, India, Kenya Pool 4: Sri Lanka, England, Zimbabwe.

 Spain drop Costa, draft in Lopez
Madrid: Former French Open champion Albert Costa was dropped from the Spanish team that will face Australia in the Davis Cup final, the Spanish tennis federation has said. Feliciano Lopez, who plays well on grass, will replace Costa for the November 28-30 final in Melbourne. The Australians have chosen grass to play Spain. Lopez will be joined by world No. 2 Juan Carlos Ferrero, Alex Corretja and Carlos Moya. Spain captain Jordi Arrese has until November 18, the deadline for nominations, to change his team. This is a difficult situation for Albert Costa, because he has always done what was asked of him, and has given his all, Arrese said. Its clear he is sad, but he knows that our decision makes sense, that we thought about it, and he understands that. Costa, ranked 25th in the world, won the French Open in 2002 and reached the semi-finals earlier this year. He played in the previous three rounds of the competition. Of course my pride is hurt, Costa said. But I also expected it. I will watch all the matches on the television, and whether they win or lose, I will feel like a winner or a loser with them. I feel part of this team. (AP)  Copyright

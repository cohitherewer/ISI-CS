The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly eye revenge vs Vasco
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ashim: Enjoying new role Calcutta: India striker Ashim Biswas said Tollygunge Agragami would seek revenge of their first-leg 0-1 loss when they meet Vasco SC of Goa in the National Football Leagues return encounter at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. We lost that match badly. We created lot of chances but could not convert them. We try to square things even tomorrow, Ashim said on Thursday. He dubbed the Goan opponents quite good, but added his team was capable of beating them. Vasco may be a good side, but there is nothing awesome about them. We should play our game and go for a win, Ashim maintained. Interestingly, acting on an advice from coach Aloke Mukherjee, Ashim has been playing as a left half of late and said he is enjoying his position. In my new role, I can now operate with lot of space. With Akeem (Abolanle) playing up and our defence also doing well, it has helped us find a new balance. Theres enough results to prove such new-found confidence in the team. Since their loss to Vasco on January 30, Tollygunge Agragami have so far remained unbeaten, winning three matches and drawing another. Ashim also played a significant part in it, scoring five goals in four matches to take his total tally to nine  behind Mike Okoro (12) and George Ekeh (10). Its nice to chase such a goal, but a victory is the biggest priority, Ashim said. Vasco (24) are four points ahead Tollygunge. East Bengal are leading the pack with 34 points from 14 outings. Vasco, who drew Churchill Brothers 1-1 in the last match, however, would approach the game in a cautious mode. Tollygunge are playing better and we have to be cautious, said Vasco coach Derrick Pereira.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 All-venue record by Steel City
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: A record 380 students, including 300 from the Steel City, will display their skills in the fourth Jamshedpur edition of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship which gets underway at the JRD Tata Sports Complex on Thursday. The participants come from 34 schools in Jharkhand and Bihar. Never before has this meet attracted so many entries  not even in Calcutta. For the first time, the meet will feature 20 tribal chess players from St Thomas School in the neighbouring Seraikela-Kharsawan district. The meet is being organised jointly by Tata Steel and Alekhine Chess Club in co-operation with the East Singhbhum District Chess Association. Satish Pillai, chief of sports department, Tata Steel, said at a press conference on Wednesday afternoon that they had tried to restrict the entries to 250 but had to increase it due to the overwhelming response. The meet would be played under the 11-round Fide Swiss rules. Manish Kumar, a talented player from Chakradharpur, is the top seed. The top five finishers of the Jamshedpur leg will qualify for the grand finale scheduled in Calcutta from August 24.  Copyright

(AFP) London: Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin-Hardenne earned Belgium a semi-final showdown with the US after propelling their country to a 5-0 rout of holders Slovakia in the Fed Cup on Sunday. Despite the absence of their top four players, a depleted American team whitewashed Italy 5-0. An impressive France trounced five-time champions Spain 4-1 to set up a last-four date with Russia, who whitewashed Slovenia 5-0. Handed the task of spearheading the US campaign in Washington, world No. 8 Chanda Rubin ensured the 17-time champions a spot in the semi-finals when a battling 5-7, 6-4, 6-0 triumph over Francesca Schiavone gave her side a winning 3-0 margin. When asked by reporters if she had decided who would play against Belgium, King replied: No, but Im going to wait until it gets closer to the time and then Ill go by the rankings before asking (the players). Slovakia limped out of the tournament after world No. 2 Clijsters thrashed Janette Husarova 6-0, 6-1 in 40 minutes in Charleroi. Henin demolished Eva Fislova 6-2, 6-1 while Els Callens and Caroline Maes completed the drubbing. Missing the services of their leading player, world No. 9 Daniela Hantuchova, Slovakia relinquished the title they won for the first time in 2002 without winning a set. Amelie Mauresmo beat Magui Serna 7-5, 6-2 to give 1997 winners France a winning lead over Spain before Stephanie Cohen-Aloro extended the margin to 4-0.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

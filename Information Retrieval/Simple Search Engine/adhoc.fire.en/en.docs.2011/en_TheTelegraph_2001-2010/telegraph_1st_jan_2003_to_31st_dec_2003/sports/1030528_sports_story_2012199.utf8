The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dissidents offer to take charge
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The impasse of Mohun Bagan club, following the court order to strip its executive committee of the power of dealing with all football-related matters, continues with officials content with passing the buck. A day after the powers-that-be in the club expressed their reluctance to take up anything related to football, the opposition stepped in Tuesday, seeking authority to sign the players within deadlines. The clubs ruling body is simply washing their hands off the key issue of forming a football team. As far as our knowledge goes, unless the Calcutta High Court-appointed three-man committee takes charge, the existing body can oversee matters related to forming the team, said Debaprasad Mukherjee, the main litigant of the case, which prompted the court to appoint the special committee. If all this amounts to contempt of court, we are ready to face any such consequence, he remarked. The deadline of inter-state transfers comes to an end on May 31. So far, Mohun Bagan have signed eight outstation players and 12 others during local transfers deadline (which ended on May 15). When contacted, club secretary Anjan Mitra reiterated his stand, saying his hands were tied after the court order. Now we are only concerned with the court-appointed committee and nobody else, he said. He also ruled out any possibility of providing any power to the opposition in dealing with the formation of team. Justice Shyamal Sen, one of the special officers, appointed by the high court (Justice Umesh Chandra Banerjee and Indrajit Sen are the two in the three-man committee) to look after the clubs football affairs, however, clarified that the clubs executive committee can go ahead and complete formalities in signing players.

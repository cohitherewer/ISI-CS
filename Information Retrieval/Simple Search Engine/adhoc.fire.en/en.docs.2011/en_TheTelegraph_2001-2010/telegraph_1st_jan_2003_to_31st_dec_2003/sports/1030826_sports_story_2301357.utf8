The Telegraph - Calcutta
 If six batsmen cant do the job, what will the seventh do, asks Syed Kirmani 
 - Unless wicketkeepers are born to wear the big gloves, they wont last at the highest level  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI There is bound to be a debate over who is Indias greatest cricketer. However, there should be no disagreement where the wicketkeeper is concerned  Syed Kirmani, now 53, stands head and shoulders above the rest. Testimony to that being his tally of 198 victims in 88 Test appearances. Additionally, he was a member of the Kapil Dev-led 1983 World Cup-winning XI. The affable Kirmani, who is in Calcutta on an invitation from the CAB, spoke to The Telegraph on Sunday evening. The following are excerpts On the essentials for a wicketkeeper Being born with natural reflexes That instinctive ability should flow in the blood Of course, wicketkeepers can be made, but if they arent born to wear the big gloves, they wont last at the highest level. Sooner, rather than later, they will be exposed. (After a pause) Besides being a natural, a wicketkeeper must be willing to learn  he has to have that attitude. On his idol I didnt idolise Budhi Kunderan, but certainly looked up to him In fact, I took to wicketkeeping by chance and, initially (at the age of six-seven), bricks were my gloves I couldnt use them for catches, but was definitely able to stop the balls in our locality matches. Later, when I was offered a pair of proper gloves (at St Josephs Indian High School, Bangalore), the fit was perfect and I took to them naturally. (Laughs) At t he same time, I didnt stop playing marbles, spinning tops or flying kites. Main sab ke liye game tha. I guess I inherited my fondness for sport from my parents. My father was a fine hockey player, while my mother was a good shuttler. I do believe that 80 per cent of an individual is a reflection of his parents. The remaining 20 per cent is influenced by the environment. On the turning point in the lead-up to his India selection (1971) The Karnataka versus Mumbai (then Bombay) Ranji match in Mumbai (1969-70). I recall that was Kunderans last game and, in a wonderful gesture, he decided not to wear the big gloves. I clicked, both with the bat and behind the wickets, and came to be noticed by the selectors. Its another matter that my debut was on hold till 1975-76. (After a pause) Here, I must place on record the encouragement received from coaches Keki Tarapore and Hemu Adhikari. On his top five wicketkeepers Alan Knott, Rodney Marsh and Bob Taylor will all be No.1. However, if I must place one ahead of the rest, it will be Taylor That trio apart, Ill pick Wasim Bari and Adam Gilchrist. On Knott Technically very sound Came the nearest to perfection till I saw Taylor. Copybook and effortless. On Marsh Despite being heavy on weight, he was so swift in his movements So many years on, I still find that incredible. On Taylor When I first saw him, I realised he moved even better than Knott Indeed, he would collect marvellously The action was so smooth For a wicketkeeper, nothing is more important than receiving the ball. He did so beautifully. On Bari A wicketkeeper should be judged on how he stands up (to spinners) Bari, in my opinion, was very good He was just as adept at standing back. On Gilchrist The technique for collections has changed I wouldnt recommend it but, today, its done side-on instead of taking the ball in front of the body, right in the middle of the chest People seem to forget that the chances of a miss are that much more with a side-on collection Yet, that has become the fashion and Gilchrist isnt found wanting. On wicketkeepers not getting noticed as much as batsmen and bowlers Its a shame that a dropped catch gets more attention than an excellent dismissal Equally, Im disappointed with this business of ODIs encouraging the selection of a batsman who can double-up as wicketkeeper. (After a pause) We played an extra (seventh) batsman in the World Cup, at the expense of a specialist wicketkeeper, but did he have a contribution? Surely, if six cant do the job, what will the seventh do? Its not going to help if specialists arent backed to the hilt Rahul Dravid is a wonderful batsman, but hes no wicketkeeper A wicketkeeper holds the most important position and is best placed to guide the captain and bowler. Actually, a wicketkeeper is ideally suited to coach Look at the Australian Academy, they had (Rodney) Marsh and Wayne Phillips at the same time I believe Brian Taber, another wicketkeeper, was there as well. On whether, generally, preferring an allrounder is the top reason why quality wicketkeepers are currently at a premium Yes, thats one solid explanation. On Team India seeing a huge turnover of wicketkeepers ever since his forced departure (1985-86) (Laughs again) The frequency has been quite like changing shirts in summer Perhaps, Im from the old school, but this treatment has been most disturbing. For Gods sake, only look at specialists. Finally, his tips for aspiring wicketkeepers Be honest, work hard and be humble. (After a pause) Its a wicketkeepers job to make a bad throw look good. So, start working from there Honestly, its a thankless job.  Copyright

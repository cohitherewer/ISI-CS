The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Glamorgan toil to 104/4 
London: After a disastrous batting performance, India A pacers led the side back on track with early wickets as Glamorgan made 104 for four in their first innings on Day II of the three-day match at Swansea on Friday. After being bowled out for a paltry 165, the visitors made a fine comeback, snaring four crucial wickets with Amit Bhandari scalping two and Avishkar Salvi and L. Balaji taking one apiece. At one stage the hosts were on 55 for four before an unbeaten 49-run partnership between Adrian Shaw and Mark Wallace helped the side cross the 100-run mark without losing any more wickets.

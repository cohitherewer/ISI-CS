The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kerala shocked
Chennai: Punjab broke the trend of one-sided matches that were on view as they rallied from two goals down to beat better rated Kerala 3-2 on the third day of the 11th national football championship for women here Tuesday. In another group C match, Haryana trounced a lowly Chandigarh 11-0, while in group A encounters, Tripura beat Jammu and Kashmir 13-0 and Goa managed to hold on to its lone third minute goal by Elwina Miranda to eliminate Karnataka from the reckoning. Both Goa (6 points from 2 wins) and Tripura (4 points from two matches) have already made it to the last eight stage but will play Thursday to decide group winners. (PTI)  Copyright

		 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 South African player against Zimbabwe trip
																								Durban: South African cricketer Errol Stewart, who is expected to be picked for the countrys A team to play in Zimbabwe at the end of this month, has openly come out against going to that country.																								Stewart, who is a lawyer by profession and secretary of the South African Players Association, said in an interview with the Sunday Times, that his views were personal and did not represent other players.																								As a lawyer Im particularly sensitive to the disregard of the rule of law in Zimbabwe, Stewart said.																								Pressure has been brought to bear on senior judges and I just cant agree with the land grabs. Added to this has been persecution of ordinary Zimbabweans and unequal distribution of food aid.																								I dont think Robert Mugabe is interested in democracy, I really dont. Having said this, my decision would be based on several considerations.																								ECB, FA poles apart																								Even the English Football Association (FA) has turned down an invitation for the England team to visit Zimbabwe in May because they considered it inappropriate.																								England play a friendly against South Africa in Durban on May 22 and were offered a fee to set up a pre-match training camp. 																								David Davies, the FA chief executive, has said the offer and fee to play in Zimbabwe had been immediately declined.																								ECB chief executive Tim Lamb said the two issues could not be compared.																								We spoke to Davies this week and he was very keen that the FA should not be seen to be scoring a point over the ECB here, he said. 																								Its much easier to make a decision when another organisation has already gone in and tested the temperature of the water. 																								Its a very different scenario, were talking about a cricket World Cup match instead of just a friendly. Weve signed a contract and the FA hasnt, Lamb said.  (AGENCIES)

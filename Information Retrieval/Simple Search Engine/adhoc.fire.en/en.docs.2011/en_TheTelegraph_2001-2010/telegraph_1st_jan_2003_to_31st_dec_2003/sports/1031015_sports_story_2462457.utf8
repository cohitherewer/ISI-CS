 Court summons Shoaib amp; Co. 
Lahore: A Pakistani court on Tuesday summoned fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and two cricket officials to hear a petition demanding an apology and damages for attending a fashion show on a Muslim holy day. Civil court judge Mohammad Azam Has asked Shoaib, Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Rameez Raja and chief selector Aamer Sohail to appear for a hearing on October 28. The petition, submitted by an individual, demands damages worth Rs 25,000 ($431) and an apology for hurting religious sentiments by attending a fashion show on the Muslim holy night of Shab-e-Barat (a holy night for prayers) on Saturday. The damages we are claiming are just a token, the main thing is apology for hurting religious sentiments, the petitioners lawyer Ansar Mahmood Bajwa said. Pakistani media splashed photographs of players and officials attending a fashion parade in Islamabad late on Saturday night, the eve of Pakistans final one-day match against South Africa. Pakistan lost the match by seven wickets to lose the series 3-2. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, July 13, 2003  Professional opinion 
 FROM OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 	 Shroff				 										Bangalore, July 12: Most of the race professionals were unanimous in their opinion that favourite Grosvenor Square was the horse to beat in tomorrows Derby. The following are views of some of participants:				 										Trainers				 										Darius Byramji: Both my wards will give a good account of themselves. But whoever beats Grosvenor Square will be the winner.				 										Michael Eshwer: On his second to Grosvenor Square in the Colts Stakes, Lancaster is in with a chance. But it looks like Grosvenor Square and Fond Fantasy are the frontline contenders.				 										Ganapathy: Fond Fantasy has improved with every run. She will take some beating.				 										Padmanabhan: It is between Grosvenor Square and Fond Fantasy. The former is my choice. Ramjet, at the most, can be a place proposition.				 										Jockeys				 										David Badel: Grosvenor Square will be hard to toss except for any untoward incident.				 										Srinath: Going by his two mock races, Master Craft will be thereabouts at the busy end. But the stable-mate, Grosvenor Square looks a better bet.				 										P. Shroff: Lancaster will not go down without a fight. But he will have to produce his best to get ahead of the champion colt, Grosvenor Square and the filly, Fond Fantasy.				 										B. Prakash: Grosvenor Square looks to be the public choice. But Fond Fantasy will make him fight for every inch. She is looking much improved since the Fillies Trial Stakes victory.

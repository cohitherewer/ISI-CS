 Heads may roll: Waqar
Bulawayo: Waqar Younis expects heads to roll in the wake of his teams early elimination. It was the first time since the first World Cup in 1975 that Pakistan had failed to reach the second round. There will be a few changes, Waqar said. Wasim Akram, myself, Rashid Latif, Saeed Anwar. There are a few guys who will probably not be there in the next World Cup. Waqar said Pakistan were hoping to put a sizeable total on the board against Zimbabwe, before rain restricted them to 73 for three in 14 overs. Its been a disappointing tour altogether, starting from the game against Australia, Waqar said. We played poorly throughout, even against Namibia and the Netherlands where we should have got 300 plus, and we should never have been in this position. PCB inquiry The Pakistan Cricket Board on Tuesday announced an inquiry into the teams dismal performance in South Africa. Pakistan have reached the semi-finals of all the World Cups since 1979. The only other low point was in the 1996 edition when they were beaten by India in the quarter finals. I do not think it should be taken lightly, PCB chief Lt. Gen. Tauqir Zia said on state television here even as Pakistans slim hopes of reaching the Super Sixes, which hinged on a big victory against Zimbabwe, was washed out by rain. Lt. Gen. Zia said the inquiry, to be headed by former Test player Naushad Ali, would go into all aspects and would assess the contributions of the coach and manager besides performances of the players themselves. He said the high-profile team led by Waqar had no excuse for their shoddy performance.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

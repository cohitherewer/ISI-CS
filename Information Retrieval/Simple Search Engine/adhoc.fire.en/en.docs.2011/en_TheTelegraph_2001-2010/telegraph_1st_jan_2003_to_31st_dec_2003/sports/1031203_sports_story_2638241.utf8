The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kartik stars in resounding win
 Kartik took 4/27 Pune: India A registered a splendid innings-and-92-run victory against Sri Lanka A on the final day of their Test match at the Nehru Stadium here on Tuesday. Left-arm spinner Murali Kartik (four for 27), pacemen Amit Bhandari (three for 28) and Munaf Patel (two for 33) combined well to bundle out the Lankans for a paltry 124 in their second innings. The hosts declared their first innings closed at the overnight score of 556 for seven, thus taking a lead of 216. It was Rohan Gavaskar and Gautam Gambhir centuries which had helped India A post such an imposing score.  The India A bowlers took a firm grip over the visiting  batsmen from the start of their second innings and didnt  allow any partnership to develop. Bhandari struck the first  two blows, sending back P. Jayawardene and Test-reject Jehan  Mubarak to make the score 26 for two. I. Daniel and L. De  Silva produced some resistance for the third wicket. Just  when it looked they would guide the visitors to safe shores,  Kartik got into the act. The ODI regular, unlucky to miss  out on a ticket to Australia, sent back both those batsmen  as well as A. Polonovita to reduce the Lankans to 72 for  five. There was no escape for the islanders from then on.  Kartik bagged one more victim, Munaf Patel chipped in with  two. Daniel top-scored with 30, while K. Weeraratne made  25. N. nawaz did not bat due to injury.  Copyright

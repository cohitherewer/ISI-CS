The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Of Wadekars curtains and Merchants casting vote
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Wadekar Pataudi Calcutta, Sept. 6: Ajit Wadekar was shopping for curtains, back one January afternoon in 1971, when Vijay Merchants casting vote gave him the India captaincy for the West Indies tour. That remains the most controversial act by any selection committee chairman in India. In fact, Merchants conduct had no precedent and nobody has attempted the same since. Apparently, with Easts M.N. Dutta Roy mysteriously absent, the selectors were divided 2-2 on continuing with Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi. Thats when Merchant (representing West) chose to use the chairmans trump card. Incidentally, of that quintet, only Souths C.D. Gopinath is alive. Centrals M.M. Jagdale (father of current selector Sanjay) and Norths Bal Dani completed the selection committee. Pataudi, one understands, had Jagdale and Gopinaths support. Merchant and Dani wanted Wadekar. Had he been present, Dutta Roy would have voted for Pataudi, preventing the chairman from scripting a dubious chapter. Wadekar, of course, had no inkling that he would be replacing Pataudi. That shopping exercise, therefore, continued for a couple of hours. Its when Wadekar returned home that he got the dramatic news from well-wishers waiting with laddoos and a hundred garlands. To say the least, I was taken aback If somebody had to replace Pataudi, Id assumed it would be Chandu Borde Nobody had remotely suggested I was in the running, Wadekar told The Telegraph this morning, shortly before returning to Mumbai. [Wadekar was in the city as chief guest for yesterdays prize distribution ceremony of the countrys premier schools chess tournament.] Once through with being garlanded and stuffed with laddoos, Wadekar telephoned Pataudi for a candid one-on-one. That was the first call he made as India captain. Pataudi took the change in his stride and, when I asked if he was available to play under me, promptly said yes. As for me, I assured Pataudi he would be in my side, which was to be picked the next day. In the morning, though, Pataudi called to say he was opting out for personal reasons He wished me good luck and added I should convey his non-availability to the selectors I was disappointed, but there was nothing I could do, Wadekar recalled. Indeed, Wadekar acknowledged he hadnt been scoring in the Ranji Trophy in the lead-up to the selection  Team India, by the way, had no international commitments after the 1969-70 (home) series against Bill Lawrys Australia  and had jokingly asked Pataudi to ensure he wasnt dropped. That was when both of us happened to be together at the Brabourne nets As it turned out, Pataudi got omitted and Wadekar pointed out, continuing: Whatever anybody may say, Pataudi and I had a good understanding and it wasnt uncommon to have a drink together He would consult me and, when he played under my captaincy (1972-73, versus Tony Lewis England), I didnt hesitate to seek his views I regard Pataudi as one of the finest captains anywhere. Wadekar remains in the dark over why Merchant chose to sack Pataudi, but it has often been whispered that the chairmans strained relationship with Pataudis father (Iftikhar Ali Khan, who played for England and India) influenced that move. To settle an old score, it seems the son was made a victim.  As has been well documented, Wadekar authored history  in the West Indies and, a few months later, also beat England  in England. In 1974-75, however, Pataudi was back as captain   after Wadekars (premature) retirement.  Copyright

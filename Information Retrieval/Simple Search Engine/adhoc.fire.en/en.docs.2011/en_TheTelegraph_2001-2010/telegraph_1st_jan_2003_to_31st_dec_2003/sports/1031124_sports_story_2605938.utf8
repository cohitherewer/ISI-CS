The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Good start by Bengal
 Haldipur is unbeaten on 79 Tirunelveli: An unbeaten 79 by Nikhil Haldipur and his 119-run opening partnership with Amitava Chakraborthy helped Bengal reach 207 for three against Tamil Nadu on a rain-interrupted first day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match on Sunday. Haldipur and Laxmi Ratan Shukla were at the crease when play was called off due to rain 25 minutes into the post-tea session. Electing to bat, Bengal began on a sound note with both Nikhil and Amitava playing confidently as the visitors took lunch at 95 for no loss. Tamil Nadu got the first wicket in the 42nd over when off-spinner Ganesh Kumar removed Amitava. Stand-in captain Devang Gandhi fell soon and Bengal lost another wicket when Subhamoy Das was adjudged leg-before to medium pacer C. Ganapathy. Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri sounded extremely displeased with the decision. Talking to The Telegraph, Ghavri said: Subhamoy played forward and the ball brushed his pad before reaching the keeper. It was told that a mention of this was made in the captains report, which is being submitted to the Match Referee on a daily basis. Subhamoy was included in the XI ahead of Arindam Das.

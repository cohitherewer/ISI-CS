The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India, Pak go down
 Baljit Singh Saini jumps clear of a Troy Elder hit in the Perth meet clash Thursday. Australia won 2-0. (AFP) Perth: Indias new style of play failed to click as they went down 0-2 against Australia in their second league match of the three-nation invitational hockey series Thursday. India never recovered from a third-minute goal by striker Tristram Woodhouse and were dominated throughout by the Aussies who ensured a place in Sundays final with their second successive win in the tournament. India, who won their opening clash against Australia A 3-0 Wednesday, will take on Pakistan on Saturday for a berth in the final. However, the Indians will need only a draw as Australia A shocked Pakistan 5-3 late in the day. Pakistan, with two losses on the trot, will have to beat India by a comprehensive margin to make the final. Australia A, however, are not eligible for the final. The hosts were lucky to score the first goal when Woodhouse slammed home off a rebound from Devesh Chauhan. The Indians disputed the goal claiming that the ball went over the backline before the shot, the referee stuck to his decision. Indian coach Rajinder Singh said his side lost due to defensive goof-ups. We played well. We were put under pressure right from the beginning. We regrouped well and settled down as the match progressed, Singh said. Australia scored the second goal in the 44th minute when M. McCanns flick off a goalmouth melee beat the goalkeeper.

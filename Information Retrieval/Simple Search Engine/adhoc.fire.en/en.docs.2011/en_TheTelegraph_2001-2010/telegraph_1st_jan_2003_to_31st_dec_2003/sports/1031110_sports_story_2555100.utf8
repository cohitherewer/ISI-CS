The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ashish Nehra set to play versus Australia
 - Jawagal Srinath unlikely for tour Down Under  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Ganguly at the city airport, on way to Bangalore, on Sunday morning. (PTI) Calcutta: Barring a rethink, there will be four comebacks when a cornered Team India takes the field in Bangalore on Wednesday, in the tri-series game against Australia. Indeed, captain Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Anil Kumble and Ashish Nehra are the ones going to make a return. While Sourav and Nehra are coming off surgeries, Sehwag missed the Cuttack match versus New Zealand because of a twisted ankle. Kumble didnt feature in that game either, on account of his fathers death. Of course, the captain will undergo a fitness test on Monday afternoon but, given his amazing recovery after being operated upon twice, clearing that appears a formality. Ditto for Sehwag, who wasnt in discomfort during Sundays nets at the Chinnaswamy. I felt good... In fact, I also bowled, Sourav told The Telegraph, when contacted in Bangalore on Sunday. The day, after all, marked his first workout with the team in almost a month  the lay-off having been forced by an abscess in the left thigh. Nehras case is different, as he underwent surgery on his right ankle in mid April. He was in the XIV for the last match, but stayed among the reserves. Now, its certain he will play against the world champions, Indias penultimate league game. With four comebacks on the cards, the XI is bound to have a new look. Hemang Badani (retained as an additional player) will have to make way for Sourav, while Sehwag is going to be in for Sairaj Bahutule  incidentally, he is already home in Mumbai. Nehra should take Ajit Agarkars place, with Kumble replacing Murali Kartik. Zaheer Khan, one understands, has a chest infection and hasnt yet reported in Bangalore. If he isnt available, Agarkar will keep his place and share the new ball with Nehra. Rahul Dravid, whose tenure as stand-in captain has ended, is going to continue wearing the big gloves. Meanwhile, according to well-placed sources, veteran Jawagal Srinath is unlikely to make the tour of Australia, scheduled to begin later this month. It wont surprise if he announces a final good-bye very soon. Srinaths India debut was in 1991-92 and, hit by fitness problems, he hasnt played after this years World Cup final.  Copyright

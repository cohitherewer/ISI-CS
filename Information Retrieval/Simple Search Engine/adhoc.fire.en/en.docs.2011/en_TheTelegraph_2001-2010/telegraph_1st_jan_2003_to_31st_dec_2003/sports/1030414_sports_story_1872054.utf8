 Ferrari delay
Milan: Ferrari postponed the long-awaited debut of its new F2003-GA model in the world Formula One championship, saying Sunday it will start the F2002 car in the San Marino Grand Prix next weekend. The team announced its decision following unsatisfactory tests of the new car, which had been expected to start in the April 20 race at Imola. (AFP)  Copyright

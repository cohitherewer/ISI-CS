 Anand in last 16
New Delhi: Viswanathan Anand cruised into the pre-quarter finals of the seventh Corsica Masters chess tournament in Bastia, France, according to information reaching here. The world rapid chess champion took a step towards annexing another title when he outplayed Croatian Grandmaster Miso Cebalo 1.5-0.5 in the round of 32. A win this year will make it four-in-a-row for Anand. He will play Joel Lautier with the black pieces in the first game of the next round. Lautier beat Vladimir Epishim 2-0. Another Indian, Krishnan Sasikiran lost in the round of 32 to Mikhail Gurevich 0.5-1.5. Sasikiran lost in a rook and minor piece ending in 47 moves with the black pieces and had to agree for a draw in 70 moves with white. In the first of his two-game match with Cebalo, Anand won two pawns after the opening with black pieces. Cebalo then blundered a rook on the 23rd move and it cost him a rook for bishop. Anand made no mistake and won easily. In the next game, Anand seemed content with a draw even though he was in a winning position. (PTI)  Copyright

 Serena in a new role
Los Angeles: Two-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams will play a reformed gang member on parole in an October 1 episode of the showtime series Street Time. As a fan of Street Time, I told myself that if given the opportunity, Id love to be on the show, Serena said on Wednesday. I am taking this role very seriously, because I want to excel.  Serena, ranked No. 1, had the role created for her, said Richard Stratton, the cable shows co-executive producer. Anyone that has seen Serena perform on the tennis court understands her commitment to being the best, he said. Serena, who missed the US Fed Cup victory over Italy last weekend because of an acting commitment, has appeared in commercials with her sister, Venus. She also played a kindergarten teacher last year in an episode of the ABC sitcom My Wife and Kids. Street Time, starring Rob Morrow, begins its second season on August 6. (AP)  Copyright

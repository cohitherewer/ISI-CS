				 																																	Sao Paulo: Sao Paulo officials were working to quash a judges injunction which threatened to force the cancellation of the Formula Ones Brazilian Grand Prix.				 																																	On Friday, judge Joao Andre de Vincenzo of the 12th financial court issued an injunction suspending the contract between the city of Sao Paulo and Formula One management. Vicenzo justified his decision citing the high cost to the city and low return. The judge said he would fine the city $17,000 a day if it failed to cancel the contract within 30 days.				 																																	We are confident, that putting together documents we will show how an event like this benefits the city, municipal sports secretary Nadio Campeao said. Sao Paulo officials hope to get the injunction thrown out before the contract must be renewed at the beginning of 2004. 				 																																	London: Four of the worlds most prestigious marathons have refused to take part in a world-ranking system proposed by the main sponsor of the New York Marathon.				 																																	Directors of London, Chicago, Boston and Berlin said on Tuesday the plan devised by the Netherlands-based banking would create problems with their sponsors. Race directors also said they were not consulted by ING.				 																																	Theres a potential for sponsor conflict, or confusion at the very least, said Guy Morse, executive director of the Boston Athletic Association.				 																																	Dubai: The United Arab Emraites has declared the Fifa World Youth Championship the Middle Easts first tobacco-free sporting event, organisers said on Wednesday. 				 																																	The Ministry of Health have banned smoking at any venues in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah and Al Ain from November 27 to December 19. Tobacco advertising has also been ruled out at the meet of 24 teams including Brazil, England, Argentina, and Germany. 				 																																	New York: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson confirmed on Tuesday the English champions will return to the United States for a pre-season tour in 2004.				 																																	Weve just had our best start in the Premier League, and a lot of that is down to the preparation we had in the US over the summer, Ferguson said.				 																																	Ferguson flew to New York to officially announce that United would take part in three friendlies in the US next year.				 																																	London: Toyota believe they can become a top five Formula One team next year with regular points finishes. We were comparatively close to fifth in the constructors championship this season so this should be within our reach in 2004, said team boss Ove Andersson. Toyota finished 2003 in 8th place with 16 points.				 																																	London: A broken mast scuppered Tracy Edwards first bid to break the record time for sailing around the world non-stop. Now the demands of motherhood could mean she has to put plans for a second attempt on hold.				 																																	But Edwards is worried about being away from her 4-yr-old daughter Mackenna. Being away from her would be very difficult.				 																																	n Cricket, Zimbabwe vs WI, 2nd Test, Day II live from 1.25pm on ESPN n Soccer, Premier League, Liverpool vs Manchester United from 12 noon on STAR Sports n Tennis, Masters Cup live from 11.30 pm on STAR Sports

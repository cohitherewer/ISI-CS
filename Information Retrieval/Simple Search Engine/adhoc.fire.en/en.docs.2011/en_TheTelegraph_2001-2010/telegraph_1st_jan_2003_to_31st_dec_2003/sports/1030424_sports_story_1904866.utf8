 Hashan Tillekeratne quits one-day scene
 Hashan Tillekeratne takes a break from practice Wednesday. (AFP) Colombo: Sri Lankas Hashan Tillekeratne retired from one-day International cricket on Wednesday, less than a week after being appointed Test captain. I want to concentrate more on Test cricket and this will also give room for some of the youngsters to come up, said Tillekeratne, who turns 36 in July. The left-handed opening batsman was in Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup-winning side. He was axed from all international cricket for two years after the 1999 World Cup before returning to favour. Tillekeratne scored 3,789 in 200 ODIs, averaging 29.60 since his debut in 1986. He was named Test captain last Thursday, with Maravan Atapattu picked to lead the one-day side  the first time Sri Lankas selectors have split the captaincy. Tillekeratne is seen as an interim skipper after Sanath Jayasuriyas decision to stand down. Sri Lanka play New Zealand in the first of two Tests starting on Friday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

		 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 ICC ready for mediation
																								New Delhi: The Contract Issue between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the BCCI showed no signs of resolution with the games governing body saying it was ready for mediation even as it accepted Jagmohan Dalmiyas resignation from one of its committees.																								In the battle of attrition, ICC president Malcolm Gray said Tuesday that the BCCI was still obliged to send its best team to the World Cup in South Africa.																								The ICC promptly accepted Dalmiyas resignation from the World Cup Contracts Committee saying it was prepared to begin the mediation process as quickly as possible but warned that BCCI would have to take the blame if it failed to ensure the participation of its top players after having signed the Participating Nations Agreement.																								We want the best Indian team to play, the contractual legal obligation to the BCCI is to field the best team, Gray said to a TV channel.																								 If the BCCI is not able to manage its best players, unfortunately there will be large damages and compensation. The ultimate responsibility will reside with the BCCI, warned the ICC chief. 																								He also informed that the ICC had accepted Dalmiyas resignation from the Contracts Committee. Yes, we would welcome his resignation if it solves the problem. But it does not change the legal obligation the BCCI has to the ICC.																								Asked about ICCs course of action if the Indian players refused to sign the contract, Gray said I would think the Indian public will be quite outraged if they do not sign. I am sure everyone wants the best Indian team to play in the World Cup.  (PTI)

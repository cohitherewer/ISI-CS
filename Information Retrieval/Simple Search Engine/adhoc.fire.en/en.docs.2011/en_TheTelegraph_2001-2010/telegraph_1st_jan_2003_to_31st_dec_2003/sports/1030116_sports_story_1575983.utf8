		 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 Serena for fewer meets
				 	 Serena Williams after her win Tuesday																								Melbourne: World No. 1 Serena Williams has lent her voice to calls for the womens season to be cut amid fears that top players are burning out. Serena is a firm believer that the WTA tour should look at cutting events from the calendar.																								Everyone knows Im not a pro of all the tournaments that we have to play, Serena said. Im all about less tournaments, more money.																								The American acknowledges that changing the packed schedule will be hard with rank-and-file professionals likely to oppose any move to reduce their earning opportunities.																								Its really tough because theres a lot of girls who would like to play more tournaments and who live to play those tournaments.																								Im just not one of those girls, but I think the majority of the girls are, so its kind of tough, Serena said after her Round I scare Tuesday. 																								While Serena believes most players will oppose a move towards fewer events, her stance will have found approval from Belgian fifth-seed Justin Henin-Hardenne. 																								Henin, who breezed past Anna Kournikova Wednesday, said the short break in the off-season made it difficult to recuperate properly.																								When we finish mid-November and have to start first week of January, its hard, said the 20-year-old. If you want to have a good break and some good preparation its hard to be ready for the Australian Open. You only have a couple of weeks.																								Henin believes the solution could be to move the Australian Open to a later date in the year. (AFP)

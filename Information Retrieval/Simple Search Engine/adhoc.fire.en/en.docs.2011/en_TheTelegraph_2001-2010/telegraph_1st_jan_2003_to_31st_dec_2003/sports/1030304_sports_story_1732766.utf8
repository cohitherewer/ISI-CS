				 																																	Dhaka: The Bangladesh team will face a formal inquiry after their dismal performance at the World Cup which the media said brought shame on the country, reports said on Monday.				 																																	A committee with a retired bureaucrat and an army officer who have good cricket knowledge will be set up and they will talk with everyone, from the coach, team members and even myself, Ali Asghar Loby, president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCC), told the Bengali-daily Prothom Alo.				 																																	Loby, whose resignation was demanded during a demonstration in Dhaka on Sunday, indicated the teams Pakistani coach Mohsin Kamal and other officials would be fired. We dont need them as we want someone who can give results ... We gave them everything they asked for, but got nothing in return, he said.				 																																	Pretoria: With the India-Pakistan clash living up to its billing at Centurion Park on Saturday, the clamouring for resumption of cricketing ties between the two neighbouring countries is steadily becoming louder.				 																																	Former Pakistan skipper Imran Khan has called for resumption of cricketing ties, stating it would benefit cricket in both the countries.				 																																	I definitely think there should be more Indo-Pak cricket... It will benefit the game in both the countries, said Imran. 				 																																	Those who normally do not watch cricket and do not know much about it, start watching the matches. All they care is about winning and losing without understanding the subtleties, said Imran.				 																																	n Zimbabwe vs Pakistan live from 1 pm on Max n West Indies vs Kenya, live from 1.30 pm on Sony n Follow Through from 9.30 pm on ESPN

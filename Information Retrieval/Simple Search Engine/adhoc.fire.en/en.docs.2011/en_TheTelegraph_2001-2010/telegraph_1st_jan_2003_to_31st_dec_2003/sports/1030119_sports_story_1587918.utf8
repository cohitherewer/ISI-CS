The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 White set February 4 deadline
																								London, Jan. 18 (Reuters): England allrounder Craig White has been told to prove his fitness by February 4 if he is to play in the World Cup starting next month, it was reported Saturday.																								White, 33, sustained a side strain in the fourth Test against Australia in Melbourne last month and has not fully responded to treatment. White is the one that we have to have a real look at, said England coach Duncan Fletcher.																								He has had enough cricket this winter but his injury has to be reassessed and we will have to follow his progress. The worst scenario is that we will take him to South Africa and, if he is not fit for the very first warm-up game, we will have to look at changing it.																								England are scheduled to play their first preparation match against Eastern Province in Port Elizabeth on February 4. 																								Should White fail in his fitness bid, he could be replaced in Englands 15-man squad with Surrey captain and allrounder Adam Hollioake.

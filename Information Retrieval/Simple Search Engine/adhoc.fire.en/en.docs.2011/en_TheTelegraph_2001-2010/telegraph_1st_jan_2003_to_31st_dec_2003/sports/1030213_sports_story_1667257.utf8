The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No replay if reason isnt security 
Harare: The Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) warned Wednesday they wouldnt play their match vs England if it was switched to South Africa on grounds other than safety and security. If its (the reason to switch the game) outside the issues of safety and security, I dont think it will be agreeable to us, ZCU chairman Peter Chingoka said. The Namibians had a good three days here... safe and secure, and the match was played in very good spirits. Chingoka said: We have passed every test. Its getting like playing computer games  having to guess wheres the next obstacle or whats the next hidden trap. The losses The other problem is the lossthe millions of dollars ZCU will lose for the match being called off. Weve only just started to add up how much money will go down the drain, but it runs into millions and millions of Zimbabwe dollars and millions of US dollars, Vince Hogg, the managing director of the ZCU said Wednesday. For a start, weve had to pay a 100 percent cancellation fee for all the hotel rooms we booked. A room at the hotel where the England squad and their supporters would have stayed costs $130 a night. We had a 44-seater bus laid on to transport the supporters from the airport, and a lot of auxiliary transport as well, Hogg said. Hogg said it was also too late to cancel catering and security arrangements for the match, and that those costs would also have to be borne by the ZCU. He was uncertain whether people who had tickets for the game would be able to use them for another match or would be reimbursed. Its an ICC match, and were waiting for direction from them, Hogg said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

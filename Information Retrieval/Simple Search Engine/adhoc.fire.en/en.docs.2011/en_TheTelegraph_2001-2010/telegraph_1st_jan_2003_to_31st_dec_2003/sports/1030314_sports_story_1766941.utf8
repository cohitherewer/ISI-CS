The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hewitt support for breakaway body
Indian Wells (California): World number one Lleyton Hewitt says he supports the idea of a breakaway International Mens Tennis Association (IMTA). For sure, Hewitt said after reaching the third round of the Pacific Life Open with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Russias Yevgeny Kafelnikov on Wednesday. With my experiences with the ATP Tour, Ive got to look at it in a very positive way. Any way things can be helped, thats great for everyone. At the end of the day, I know with my dealings with the ATP that theres a lot of room for improvement. Hewitt was the first top-10 player to say the men needed a new organisation to better serve their interests. The proposed IMTA is headed by South African Wayne Ferreira and Laurence Tieleman of Belgium.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

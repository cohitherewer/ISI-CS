 Taylor-made tips for Sourav
  Johannesburg: Former Australian Test captain Mark Taylor, who went through a long lean patch like the one Sourav Ganguly is currently experiencing, has a word of advice for the embattled Indian skipper  just hang in there.Taylor, who came under fire after going through 21 Test innings without a 50, said he knew how mentally agonising it is for a captain to hit poor form.Its not a nice feeling. You are worried more than anyone else that you are not scoring runs, the media is jumping on your back, the former cricketers are calling for your head and theres always someone who is being projected as the next captain, the 38-year-old said.All this after you have worried yourself silly about captaining the team. It can be a very frustrating time if you are the captain and not scoring runs. Ask Ganguly and he will tell you, said Taylor.His advice to Sourav was: Hang in there, things will turn around. He is a good batsman and he should be back among the runs but not this way (the way he got out against Australia). You cant hope to slog your way back to form. You need to spend time in the middle, take blows on your body if needed and you should have that determination to get back to form, Taylor added.He opined that there will be a lot of debate on Sourav and his captaincy. Its bound to be. He is the captain of the side, of a nation that takes its cricket very, very passionately and the Indian public is never satisfied. They want fifties and hundreds all the time. I can understand the pressure Sourav must be feeling, he said.He was baffled at Indias batting. I am not sure what they were trying to do. They have come off a disastrous series against New Zealand where none of them got runs. And here they were, trying to hit their way out of trouble. You cant bat like this against a quality bowling attack. Ganguly, Sehwag and others played some  Copyright

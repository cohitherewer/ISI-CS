The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCA chief is manager
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI New Delhi: The Bihar Cricket Association president, Amitabh Choudhary, will be the manager of the U-19 Indian side which will visit Pakistan later this month. Led by Ambati Tirupati Rayudu, the team is going to participate in the October 31-November 6 Asian meet. Indias matches, by the way, will all be in Lahore, where the PCB is headquartered. Choudharys appointment is interesting as he is a senior IPS officer, currently posted in Ranchi. Needless to say, the security aspect will be closely monitored by just about everybody during that short trip. An incident-free visit will definitely be well received by the powers-that-be in New Delhi and could help in the clearance of Team Indias trip to Pakistan early next year. The last visit across the western border was back in late 1997, when the Sachin Tendulkar-captained side played three ODIs. Choudhary, of course, is happy with the assignment given by the BCCI. Its going to be something different and, really, I didnt hesitate in saying yes when the president (Jagmohan Dalmiya) made the offer, Choudhary told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. As already announced, Robin Singh will be coaching the U-19 lads.  Copyright

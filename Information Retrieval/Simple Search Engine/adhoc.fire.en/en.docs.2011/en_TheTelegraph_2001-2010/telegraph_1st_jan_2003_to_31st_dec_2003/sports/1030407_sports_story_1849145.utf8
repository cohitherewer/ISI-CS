The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rooney stars in Everton victory 
Liverpool: Teenage striker Wayne Rooney guided Everton to a controversial 2-1 victory over Newcastle United on Sunday and dealt a hammer blow to the Tynesiders title hopes. Rooney, who helped England to a vital Euro 2004 qualifying win over Turkey on Wednesday, rounded of an unforgettable week for the 17-year-old by heading Everton in front after 18 minutes at Goodison Park. French winger Laurent Robert rifled in a stunning equaliser just before halftime, but a superb solo run and pass by Rooney for Kevin Campbell led to a match-winning penalty converted by David Unsworth in the 65th minute. However, Newcastle boss Bobby Robson was fuming after the referee ignored a knee-high tackle by Evertons Danish midfielder Thomas Gravesen on Olivier Bernard before the ball even reached Rooney for his run. I thought it was an outrageous tackle, its almost a red card, Robson told Sky Sports. He already has a yellow card, so we know he has to go off. I just couldnt understand Mr (Neale) Barry not seeing it and giving it. He played on for quite some time  he must have known the player was injured and on the ground  and then a penalty was awarded against us. It was a crucial decision. Its actually cost us the match... I think Mr Barry will not sleep tonight. Robson said he had not spoken to the referee after the game, adding: Id lose my rag (temper) with him and theres no point doing that. Everton boss David Moyes also believed Neale should have stopped the move that led to his teams winning goal and said he had tried to get his men to put the ball out of play. (Reuters)  Copyright

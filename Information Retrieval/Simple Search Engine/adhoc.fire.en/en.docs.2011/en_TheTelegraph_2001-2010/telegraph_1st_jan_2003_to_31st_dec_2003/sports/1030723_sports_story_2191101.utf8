 Aussies feast on buffalo, wallaby
 Steve feels visiting an aboriginal community was an eye-opener Darwin: The Australian cricketers should have been playing the final day of their Test match with Bangladesh on Tuesday, but instead they spent the day eating buffalo and fishing with aborigines on the remote Tiwi Islands, north of here. Steve Waughs team brushed aside Bangladesh in double-quick time, winning the first of the two Tests by an innings and 132 runs on the third day Sunday. The second Test begins in Cairns on Friday. The worlds best cricket team mixed with the tiny indigenous community of Milikapiti on Melville Island. They ate buffalo and wallaby, learnt about Tiwi Island culture and went fishing with locals. Its been a real eye-opener for us, to visit an aboriginal community and see the culture and traditions, and the way people live, captain Steve Waugh said. Its something new to us and its a great experience. Australian football is obviously number one here, but I think the kids here have definitely got potential for cricket. Waugh added: I see a lot of talent. I think they probably need a role model and they need people to come up here and to show them how to play the game. Islander Mary Elizabeth Moreen said the community loved to watch international cricket on television, but had never played the sport. Our children have never ever had cricket in the community. This is the first time, Moreen said. They didnt know how the game is played. They were all excited and happy. Fast bowler Jason Gillespie said the Australian team could inspire aboriginal talent to come through and play top-level cricket.  (AFP)  Copyright

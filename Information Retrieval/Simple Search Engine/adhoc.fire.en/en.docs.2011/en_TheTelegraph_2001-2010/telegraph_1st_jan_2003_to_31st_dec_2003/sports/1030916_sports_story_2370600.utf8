The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Super Series on ICC agenda
 - Official status likely for Best vs Rest matches  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has proposed a high-voltage Super Series, featuring one five-day game and three limited overs matches, from 2005. According to The Telegraphs sources, the four games will pit the ICCs No.1 ranked team in Tests and ODIs against the Rest of World in both forms. In all probability, this Super Series will be held every two years. The technicalities are being sorted out, but its understood that the matches are going to be accorded official status  in fact, such recognition will be unprecedented. After all, the Rest of World versus England and Australia series, in 1970 and 1970-71, respectively, remain unofficial with the runs and wickets simply added to the first-class record of the players in question. The ICC will formally recommend (to the ten Test-playing nations and Kenya, which has ODI status) that the five-day game be treated as a full-fledged Test and the three limited overs matches be recognised as proper ODIs, informed London-based sources. Apparently, that proposal will be placed before the ICCs Cricket Committee-Management meeting in Mumbai, on Thursday and Friday. In any case, the Super Series is listed as item 4.4 under the events head. Clearly, some groundwork has been done ahead of the chief executives (Mumbai) session. While multiple questions have to be answered  not least pertaining to status and selection of the Rest of World  the idea itself is exciting with a capital E and the ICC should have little problem in adding to its kitty. Of course, the pitch could queer if the ICC insists on enforcing the Player Terms made mandatory for the World Cup and Champions Trophy. Actually, it cant afford another controversy.

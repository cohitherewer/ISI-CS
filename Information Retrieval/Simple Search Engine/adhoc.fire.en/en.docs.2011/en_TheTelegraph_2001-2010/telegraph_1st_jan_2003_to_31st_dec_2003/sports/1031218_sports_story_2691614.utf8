 Shoaib to focus on wickets, not pace
 Shoaib says hes more sensible now Hamilton: Shoaib Akhtar is eyeing wickets and not speed records ahead of the first Test against New Zealand starting on Friday, as he leads a relatively fresh-faced Pakistan bowling attack. The Rawalpindi Express has played 28 Tests, the same combined total as Mohammed sami, Shabbir Ahmed and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria. Im a more mature bowler, I concentrate more on line and length now and Im very sensible. Im after more wickets now rather than bowling fast. There is a responsibility, I have to take it on. Im going to be a big part of the attack, I want to lead the way for the young team, said Shoaib, declaring himself fully fit after a calf muscle problem. In his last Test against New Zealand in Lahore last year he took six for 11 to dismiss the tourists for 73 in reply to Pakistans 643. The home side won that match by an innings and 324 runs. I had a rough time recently because of injury and allegations against me. It took me about one year to get over it. What is done is done, the circumstances are different and Im happy to be back.  Cairns motivation Chris Cairns goes into the Test with a different aim. His eyes are on becoming the sixth member of the exclusive club of players to have scored 3,000 runs and taken 200 wickets. The 33-year-old is fired up for his 56th Test. He needs 147 runs and three wickets to join Richard Hadlee, Ian Botham, Imran Khan, Kapil Dev and Garfield Sobers. Ive got a bit of apprehension, a bit of anxiety but mainly excitement, Cairns said. Im not really motivated by statistics, but in this situation with 200 and 3,000 it is probably the one time Ill pay attention to it. It will mean something to me but Im not going to get stuck on it. The home team will be up against it, after having lost all five one-day Internationals on its recent short tour of Pakistan. The Black Caps missed several regular players on that tour, not all of whom  including Shane Bond and Nathan Astle  are yet available.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, January 06, 2003  It was an exciting Derby: Daniel 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 										Calcutta: Romantic Notes victory did not surprise trainer Vijay Singh a bit. The crafty trainer had candidly admitted on the Derby-eve that the threat to his Derby-favourite may come from his own stable. Who is worried about the opposition. The threat to my favourite may come from my own stable. This was Vijays reply when asked as to who his threat was? But again, he did not reveal as to who was his favourite. Im too damned thrilled by the outcome of the Derby, was all Vijay had to say.				 										Equally delighted was jockey Shanker fior his maiden victory in the Derby that took his classic tally to three. I realised my dream coming true as I approached the distance-post. I was pretty sure of winning in the last 200m, said Shanker who also admitted that he was not not nervous as he approached the winning post.				 										Daniel who had four horses running for the Derby was quite logical when asked about his reaction to the upset victory of Romantic Notes. Let me tell you, it was an exciting Derby and the the best horse on the day won, said Daniel. What was significant according to Daniel is that the Derby has opened the door for very competitive racing event in the coming months. 				 										The first five horses finished in a very close order. We have a very competitive racing (in the top class terms and graded races) coming in the weeks to follow, said Daniel.

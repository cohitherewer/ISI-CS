The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Patel, Kartik save Indias day
 - THREE-DAY TIE - Nicholson burst gives hosts 66-run lead  Sourav Ganguly, Rahul  Dravid and Ajit Agarkar take a break at the Bellerive  Oval on Saturday while (picture below) Parthiv Patel  hits out en route to his 49. (PTI) Hobart, Dec. 20 (PTI): India conceded a 66-run first-innings lead to Australia A before claiming three quick wickets for 57 in the hosts second innings on Day Two of the three-day match at the Bellerive Oval here. Young Parthiv Patel top-scored with 49 and put on a fighting 71-run partnership with Murali Kartik (26) to stem the rot after the hosts had plunged to 162 for seven replying to 311 for five declared. It was the best partnership of the Indian innings. Patel and Kartik got their heads down and attended to the depressing situation with diligence, placing the ball between gaps, flicking and driving through covers with great expertise. Patel was the more belligerent partner, taking a strong liking to Cameron Whites leg-spin and hitting a flurry of boundaries most of which were on the offside. The left-hander hit eight in all before being caught in the slips flirting with an away-going delivery off Matthew Nicholson. Kartik, who negotiated 55 balls, was run out soon after. Both wickets went down without any addition to the tea-time total of 233 for seven. Irfan Pathan and Ashish Nehra resisted the Australia A attack for a few overs before the former fell to Nicholson for 11. Nehra remained unbeaten on nought. The top order had earlier crumbled dramatically from 104 for two. Sachin Tendulkar (36), Virender Sehwag (30), Sourav Ganguly (5) and Akash Chopra (46) were followed by Laxmipathy Balaji (8) in quick succession to put the hosts on top. Tendulkar, who has made just 38 runs in three innings in the first two Tests, reached 36 on Saturday before hooking Damien Wright to Paul Rofe at deep fine-leg. Tendulkar looked in good touch during his 69-minute stay at the wicket, his runs coming off 45 balls. Sehwag took 28 balls to move to 30 with five fours before hanging out his bat at a delivery from Shaun Tait to be caught by wicketkeeper Wade Seccombe. Sourav got to five when he played away from his body to be caught at gully off Nicholson. Akash Chopra batted with caution, making 46 in 203 minutes off 140 balls. But he rushed from the non-strikers end for a non-existent single and was run out. Deep Dasgupta, Chopras overnight partner, was the first man out. He was ruled leg-before to Simon Tait, Australias latest fast bowling hope. Tait took three wickets but went for 72 runs in his 16 overs. Nicholson was the most impressive bowler, taking four for 25 off 21 overs. As Australia A started their second innings, India struck almost immediately. Pathan and Balaji both bowled with a lot of purpose to send back openers Chris Rogers and Michael Hussey cheaply. Balaji added a second scalp when he castled Martin Love.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Miandad heaves a sigh of relief
Wellington: Pakistan coach Javed Miandad didnt want to imagine his fate had the Wellington weather sealed one of the biggest blunders in Test history on Tuesday. Miandads last visit here ended with his sacking after the Test series was drawn 1-1. If rain had denied Pakistan the chance to knock off the remaining 28 runs on the final day, he may have been safer not returning home. The Pakistan players were having their morning tea when they threw open the curtains to see the rain tumbling down on Day V. It raised the chance of New Zealand snatching a miraculous draw after captain Inzamam-ul Haq did not ask for the extra 30 minutes on Day IV, with Pakistan within striking distance of win. Obviously it was not my decision but we were a bit confused. It was the first time Inzamam was facing such a situation, Miandad said later. It could have been different on the fifth day, if it rained more we definitely would have cried. The Pakistan Cricket Board may well have been asking some questions too. They would have been thinking the same way as you all. But people do make mistakes, the relieved Miandad said. (AFP)  Copyright

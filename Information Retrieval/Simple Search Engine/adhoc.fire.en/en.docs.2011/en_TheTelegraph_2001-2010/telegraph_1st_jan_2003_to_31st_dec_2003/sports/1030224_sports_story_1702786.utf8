The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gordon tips and Wright spirit
  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI File picture of John Wright with his wards Pietermaritzburg: Its at hot shot sport psychologist Sandy Gordons suggestion that the Indian cricketers have chosen a theme (Now or Never) for the World Cup. Again, its at his prompting that coach John Wright has given a greater role to youngsters in team meetings.Its not that the youngsters had no contribution but, after Gordons sessions in Paarl, Wright decided to involve them in a more significant manner, informed a well-placed source.Talking to The Telegraph Sunday morning, the source added: Towards that end, Wright has been assigning briefing tasks to the youngsters. At team meetings, then, even they have to speak about either the batting or bowling or fielding strategy.  Apparently, Saturday evenings team meeting (ahead of the Namibia match) was addressed, among others, by Zaheer Khan (bowling) and Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif (fielding). The batting, of course, was taken care of by senior pros Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, while captain Sourav Ganguly did the summing up.Clearly, there are pluses in greater participation and Wright (whose contract is up for renewal after the World Cup) has chosen to encourage the Yuvrajs even more.Incidentally, the huddling of the XI after every wicket has also been at Gordons suggestion. That reinforces the unity bit, besides reminding the players that wickets remain to be taken.Going by the acceptance of his ideas, it wont surprise if Gordon now has a larger role in Indian cricket.

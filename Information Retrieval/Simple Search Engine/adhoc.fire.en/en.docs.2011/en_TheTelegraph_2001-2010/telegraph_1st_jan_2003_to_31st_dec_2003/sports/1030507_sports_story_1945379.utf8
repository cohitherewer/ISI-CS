The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vaughan confirmed as one-day skipper
 Michael Vaughan at a press meet where the ECB announced he was the new one-day skipper London: Michael Vaughan has been appointed Englands new one-day captain, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced Tuesday. The Yorkshire batsman takes over from Test skipper Nasser Hussain, who resigned from his one-day responsibilities after England failed to progress beyond the first round of this years World Cup in southern Africa. The 28-year-old opener, who made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in 2001, will lead the team in 10 one-day matches at home later this year but there will be no time limit on his captaincy. Vaughan, who skippered an England A tour to South Africa and Zimbabwe in 1998-99, was given the captaincy ahead of rival candidates Adam Hollioake and Marcus Trescothick. As well as being a world class batsman, Michael is a strong character with a sound cricketing brain, said David Graveney, chairman of the selectors. While he does not have extensive captaincy experience... the selectors firmly believe he has the personal attributes required to handle the pressures of the England one-day captaincy both on and off the field. Vaughan added: To lead your country is a great achievement and its a chance for us to start afresh, although I believe we were only one wicket away (in losing to Australia) from reaching the World Cup semi-finals this year. My batting shouldnt be affected. When youre out in the middle youre concentrating on that white ball and nothing else. Hollioake has already had one spell as one-day skipper, leading England to victory at the 1997 Champions Trophy tournament in Sharjah before losing the job two years later. Vaughan was one of the few success stories for England in their 1-4 Ashes defeat to Australia at the turn of the year, with his three centuries earning him the Player of the Series award. It followed a successful 2002 English season when he scored four Test hundreds.He heads the PricewaterhouseCooper Test bating ratings and is the first Englishman since Graham Gooch ten years ago to top the rankings. Meanwhile, Rodney Marsh, the former Australian wicketkeeper who has been running the ECB academy, has been appointed as an England selector. Marsh, 55, has an enviable record as a talent-spotter. He was in charge of the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide, where several members of the leading Test and 2003 World Cup-winning team were groomed, before being invited to set up its English equivalent. His appointment was announced at Lords. Marsh joins chairman David Graveney, England coach Duncan Fletcher and former England off-spinner Geoff Miller on the panel. His first task will be to help pick a squad for the first Test against Zimbabwe, at Lords, starting on May 22. But not even a job at the heart of English cricket is likely to damage Marshs status as an Australian icon.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Michael wins battle of brothers
Montreal: Ferraris Michael Schumacher won a battle of brothers on Sunday for a Canadian Grand Prix victory that powered him to the top of the Formula One championship for the first time this season. With Finnish rival Kimi Raikkonen starting from the pitlane after a nightmare in qualifying, the five times world champion made the most of his chances to record his sixth win at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit. Raikkonen calmly battled his way back to sixth place, salvaging precious points but not enough to prevent the German from powering three clear at the halfway point of the season. Schumacher has 54 to the Finns 51. It was the 68th win of Schumachers career, and fourth of the season. Schumacher had the Williams of younger brother Ralf in his slipstream for most of the afternoon while Spains Fernando Alonso also led for Renault. Ralf had to make do with second place, 0.7 of a second behind in a reversal of the 2001 Canadian Grand Prix where he beat the Ferrari to the chequered flag. Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya was third for Williams after a costly spin on the second lap while in second place behind his teammate. Alonso was fourth and Brazilian Rubens Barrichello fifth. Meanwhile, FI supremo Bernie Ecclestone has come to the rescue of struggling Minardi as a surprise shareholder, team owner Paul Stoddart said on Saturday. I welcome my new shareholder with open arms, said the Australian. (Reuters)  Copyright

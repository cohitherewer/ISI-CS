New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh shot a brilliant seven-under 64 in the opening round of the 120-million yen Acom International golf event on the Japanese PGA Tour Thursday, but his effort was overshadowed by a record-breaking 12-under 59 by Masahiro Kuramoto of Japan. According to information reaching here from the par-71 Ishioka Golf Club in Ibaraki, the 48-year old Kuramoto became the first player in the history of the Japanese tour to break the 60 barrier. Jeev was tied second alongside another Japanese Mitsunori Harakawa.  (PTI)  Copyright

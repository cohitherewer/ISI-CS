 Poland end Indian run 
New Delhi: Indias prospects of winning the Akhbar El-Yom fifth hockey meet suffered a serious setback when they crashed to a 4-7 defeat against Poland at Cairo on Wednesday. Poland, taking advantage of Indias defensive lapses early on, pumped in five goals in first 15 minutes of the match. Though India managed a comeback scoring three goals in quick succession Poland scored two more to complete the formality, according to information received here.  (PTI)  Copyright

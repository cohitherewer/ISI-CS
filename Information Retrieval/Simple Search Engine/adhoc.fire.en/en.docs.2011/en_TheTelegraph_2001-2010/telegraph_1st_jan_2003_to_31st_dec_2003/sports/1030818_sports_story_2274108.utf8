 Makelele makes intentions clear
 Makelele says he intends to defy Real and play for France against Switzerland Madrid: Real Madrids French midfielder Claude Makelele has served notice that he intends to defy the Spanish champions and play in the international friendly against Switzerland next week, according to press reports here on Sunday. Makelele is refusing to train with Real Madrid due to a salary dispute, and the 30-year-old intends to join his national squad in Geneva despite the opposition of the Spanish side, the daily El Mundo reported. It would be another mistake to his credit, said Real sporting director Jorge Valdano. We have faxed the French federation outlining the players situation. He is not authorised to travel. Real doctors have recommended that Makelele not play in Reals friendly against Valencia or Frances friendly against Switzerland next Wednesday because of a slight change in his emotional state provoked by his personal and professional situation. Makelele is said to be unhappy with his comparatively low wages, which are reportedly only a fifth of what the clubs high-profile stars like Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Raul earn. He was hoping to double the reported monthly salary of 125,000 euros ($ 141,000) he currently earns at Real by joining English Premiership side Chelsea, who have since distanced themselves from a deal. The player joined Real in 2000 after two seasons with Celta Vigo, having earlier made his name with French league side Nantes.  (AFP)  Copyright

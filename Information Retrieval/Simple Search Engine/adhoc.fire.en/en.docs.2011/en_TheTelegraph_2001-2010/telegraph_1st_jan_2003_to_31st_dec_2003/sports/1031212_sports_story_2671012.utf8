 Real scare prompts a Ruud wage hike 
 Ruud van Nistelrooy London: English champions Manchester United are planning to double Ruud van Nistelrooys wages in a five year deal worth 24 million ($42 million). Media reports said on Monday the deal would double his wages which are currently at 40,000 ($70,000) a week. Reported interest from Real Madrid was believed to have prompted United manager Alex Ferguson to table the bid. We are progressing with his contract, Ferguson said. When United bought Van Nistelrooy from PSV Eindhoven two years ago for 19.5 million dollars ($34 million) they were taking a chance as he had just spent a year having his knee rebuilt after damaging a cruciate ligament. He was then offered less than half the wages United captain Roy Keane gets, but just how important he now is to United was underlined by German coach Felix MaGath after Van Nistelrooy destroyed his Stuttgart side in Tuesdays Champions League clash. And the the players agent Rodger Lindse is now expected in Manchester at the weekend to meet Ferguson. But after firing Manchester United into Fridays draw for the first knockout round of the Champions League, Van Nistelrooy made it clear he was not about to transfer his pursuit of the games biggest prizes from Manchester to Madrid. The striker is convinced United have a serious chance of knocking Real off their European pedestal this season, and the way they unlocked Stuttgarts highly rated defence on Tuesday certainly provided support for his confidence. Our play was outstanding. We created many chances and didnt give anything away, Van Nistelrooy said. Thats the way we should play and it feels good to be a part of that.  It is testimony to the extent which Van Nistelrooy feels at home in Manchester that as soon as Stuttgart had been dispatched, his thoughts had turned to Saturdays derby against Manchester City.  We want to continue our form in the derby, he said. We are doing well in the Premiership and the Champions League. We want that to continue, he said. United fans will however have noted how intimately the clubs prospects have become entwined with the form and fitness of their own flying Dutchman. Not content with scoring his 28th goal in 30 European matches for the club, equalling Denis Laws record with three matches to spare, Van Nistelrooy also set up Ryan Giggs for Uniteds second goal in a convincing 2-0 win. Van Nistelrooy drew level with Laws record with a first half header that was exactly the kind of goal the legendary Scot used to specialise in  finding a yard of space then hanging in the air just long enough to ensure he could direct the ball exactly where he wanted it to go. I am proud I have equalled the record of a player like Denis Law. I have a lot of respect for him, Ive seen videos of him in his heyday and he was a great goalscorer. And I only have to look at his record to realise how good he was. United have a great history and all those players are still heroes here and it is great to be level with him. The Dutchmans European tally is part of a record of 95 goals in 123 games for United, including 51 in 52 in front of the Old Trafford faithful  little wonder that Ferguson hailed him as phenomenal after Wednesdays match.

 Sri Lanka plotting to ambush Aussies: Dyson
Colombo: Sri Lankan cricket coach John Dyson said on Monday that his team was preparing for next years series against Australia after the islanders 1-0 series victory against England. Sri Lanka scored their biggest triumph against England on Sunday when they thrashed the tourists by an innings and 215 runs in the third and final Test. Dyson, a former Australian Test player, is now preparing to ambush Australia during their February-March tour of Sri Lanka. New Test captain Ricky Ponting will take charge of the worlds top-ranked Test team after Steve Waugh retires at the end of Australias current series against India. The series against Australia wont be an easy one, but were ready for the contest. Well be prepared for a tough contest, Dyson said after his team broke Englands stubborn resistance to clinch the series. He said Australia had recently shown that they are vulnerable at this point of time. Last week, Australia suffered their first home Test defeat by India in two decades at Adelaide and trail 0-1 going into the third Test in Melbourne later this week. Englands batsmen had thwarted the Sri Lankan attack to salvage draws in the first two Tests, putting pressure on the team management. Dyson took charge of the Sri Lankan team ahead of the series against England. Former skipper Duleep Mendis had stepped in as a stop-gap coach during the summer series against New Zealand and the West Indies after the contract of Dav Whatmore, another former Australian Test player, ended after the World Cup in South Africa earlier this year. Dyson said he was pleased to inherit an experienced team. Theyre a nice bunch of boys to be with. They work hard and theyre able to handle pressure situations extremely well, Dyson said. He said the Sri Lankan players had been well prepared for the England series and had been self-motivated. Each of our batsmen responded to the responsibility given to them. They knew their job and did it so well that we dominated all the three Tests, he said. There were frustrations at not having finished the job after coming close to winning in the first two Tests, but we won in the end to take the series.  (AP)  Copyright

 Latif letter to ICC on fixing
New Delhi: Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has appealed to the International Cricket Council to remove the 15-over fielding restrictions in ODIs to curb fancy fixing. In a dramatic letter to the ICC, released on the Wisden Cricinfo website, Latif said the restrictions, which bar a team from having more than two fielders outside the 30-yard circle in the first 15 overs, encouraged betting. We have certain loopholes within the format and the laws of matches, which have resulted in the birth of something that I would call fancy fixing, he said. Latif suggested that a rule to have at least four players and the bowler in the 30-yard circle for the entire 50 overs would be a better option. The Pakistan skipper drew a parallel in Tests too and said the teams should be penalised for not completing 30 overs in one session. Presently, the fine is imposed only if a team does not complete 90 overs in an entire day.Latif also suggested the creation of a special committee of recently retired captains to look into the issue of match-fixing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, January 10, 2003 				 Missed chances sink Tolly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Stanley Festus (centre) of Indian Bank in a tussle with Tollygunge stopper Sujit Neogi in an IFA Shield match at the East Bengal ground on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta: Indian Bank won by a goal as Tollygunge Agragami missed many, five were booked and one from each team was thrown out of their 108th IFA Shield match at the East Bengal ground Thursday. 																								If that makes it sound like a tough, no holds barred match, the written word can really mislead. Because, except for referee S. Bharat Mopni of Karnataka, nobody seemed much excited.																								Mopnis over-reaction spoiled some unhurried winter afternoon action. 																								The winner had been decided the bankmens way in the 12th minute of the match, when the well-built Stanley Festus took up a headed Syed Sabir Pasha pass and entered the box. 																								The defenders had been bypassed and goalkeeper Shibram Dey (who was playing for regular keeper Arindam Ghosh, down with the flu) had come out. It was easy for Stanley to change feet and tap home from close.																								The initial Tollygunge initiative wilted, and though the Indian Bank attack was hardly anything to write home about, there was always this gap in the Tollygunge defence to go through.																								To their credit, Tollygunge too did push offensives. Most of the load was carried by Akeem Abolanle and Isiaka Awoemi. 																								In the attack line, though, Akeem would often find himself sans support once at the goalmouth. He also missed many  in the 21st minute he was inside the box with the goalkeeper beaten, but he held on for too long, in the 59th minute he headed down a Mehtab Hossain pass but was off target and more.																								Meanwhile, in the 26th minute of the second half, substitute Mohamed Quizar of Indian Bank, fouled Sujay Dutta to earn his second booking and marching orders. 																								Into injury time of the match Sujit Neogi foul-tackled Stanley and got his second yellow and red card.																								Considering this was a low key starter, the referee could have seen infringements in an easier vein and let football happen instead.																								TEAMS																								INDIAN BANK: Felix Edward, David Maria, Antony Noel, Anandarajan, Villy (Noah Rozario, 90), Harish (Basheer Ahmed, 70), Mohamed Bin Hassan, Joseh, Ravi Babu (Mohamed Quizar, 47), Stanley Festus, Syed Sabir Pasha.																								TOLLYGUNGE AGRAGAMI: Shibram De, Manas Das, Sujit Neogi, Debkumar Sasmal, Dipayan Majumdar, Mehtab Hossain (Amitava Chanda 81), Sandip Das, Isiaka Awoemi, Sujay Dutta, Utam debnath (Srikanta Duta, 55), Akeem Abolanle.																								Referee: S. Bharat Mopni (Karnataka).

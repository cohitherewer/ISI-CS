The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nehra injury may force rethink
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Nehra: Sprained left ankle Pietermaritzburg: Ashish Nehras clumsy fall during the Namibia match, which sprained his left ankle, could affect the Indians strategy against England. According to The Telegraphs sources, Nehra was certain to play at Kingsmead Wednesday but, now, the thinktank may have to review the situation. Captain Sourav Ganguly put it thus: At the moment, it appears to be a sprain. However, lets see how he feels in the morning (Monday)... Sourav himself was struck on the chin, while trying to pull towards the end of his unbeaten innings, but the injury didnt necessitate stitches. Its not a deep cut, the captain remarked. While two Indians suffered injuries, the lone Pakistani on the field  umpire Aleem Sarwar Dar  escaped becoming the biggest casualty: He just about managed to save himself from a full-blooded Sachin Tendulkar strike. Later, asked whether he was preparing for the India-Pakistan game in Centurion, the Man of the Match answered smiling: I was trying to connect, thats all... Im happy I got a four.  Copyright

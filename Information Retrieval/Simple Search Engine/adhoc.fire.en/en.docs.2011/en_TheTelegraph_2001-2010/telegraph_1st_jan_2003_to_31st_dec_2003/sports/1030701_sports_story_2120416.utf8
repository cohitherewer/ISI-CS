 Okoro, Douglas to arrive before derby tie
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mike Okoro of East Bengal has confirmed availability for Saturdays Derby clash against Mohun Bagan. Revealing this late Monday, a club official said the Nigerian striker would land in the city on Wednesday. Defender Douglas da Silva is also expected to arrive before Saturdays game. Coach Subhas Bhowmick, however, is in a dilemma as to whether to field the two foreigners against Mohun Bagan. The Brazilian, though, will be in the Indonesia-bound ASEAN Club Championship squad. Bhowmick has been insisting on taking a 20-member squad to Indonesia, where the meet opens on July 13. East Bengal are likely to leave station July 8. Bhowmick livid Meanwhile, Bhowmick was livid about being forced to play three Super Division matches this week before embarking on their ASEAN Club Championship campaign. Its pathetic, you shouldnt expect good football in these conditions. Any player could have suffered a major injury today. The ground was unfit for any level of soccer. We are leaving for an international meet next week and are forced to play three matches this week by the IFA. This doesnt happen in any part of the world. Unless we have administrators like Jagmohan Dalmiya, football wont survive, said a fuming Bhowmick.  Copyright

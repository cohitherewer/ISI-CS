				 	 Amarnath: Laxman shouldve been picked																								New Delhi: With batting credentials already established, the swashbuckling Virender Sehwag will also prove his worth as a bowler and play a key role in Indias World Cup campaign in South Africa next month, Mohinder Amarnath said Monday.																								Sehwag will play a crucial role both with the bat and the ball, Amarnath, Man-of-the-Match in Indias World Cup triumph in 1983, said.																								Amarnath ensured a piece of history for himself by scoring 26 and then scalping three crucial wickets in the final against West Indies at Lords in 1983 which helped India win their only World Cup.																								The former all-rounder said he expected the Sehwag to enact a similar role as his during the quadrennial show-piece starting February 8. He is the one who can play a match-winning role, Amarnath added. 																								He, however, was not too happy with the exclusion of V.V.S. Laxman from the 15-member squad. I have nothing against Dinesh Mongia, but Laxman should have been picked. 																								Laxman has the experience and his performance on the New Zealand tour should not have been a criteria as others too did not do wonders. 																								Blatter for Cup-opener																								Fifa president Sepp Blatter has been invited to attend the cricket World Cup in South Africa by the organising committee of the countrys 2010 World Cup soccer bid, sports officials said Monday. Blatter had been invited to the opening ceremony of the World Cup February 8 and the first match of the tournament, between South Africa and West Indies in Cape Town February 9. (Agencies)

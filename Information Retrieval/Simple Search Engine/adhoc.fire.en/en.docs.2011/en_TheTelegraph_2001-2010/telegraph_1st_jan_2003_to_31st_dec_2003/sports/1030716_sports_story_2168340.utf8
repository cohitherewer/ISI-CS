The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Schumi II turning up the heat
- I love my brother even if Im battling him for the championship: Ralf  Ralf rejects suggestions that he has finally moved out of Michaels shadow this year because he considers he has always been his own man Berlin: Michael Schumacher paused, carefully considering a question that would have been unthinkable last year.The Ferrari driver, chasing a record sixth Formula One championship, had just been asked by German television who he thought was the better Schumacher right now  himself or younger brother Ralf.At the moment, its Ralf...isnt it?, he said after Ralfs French Grand Prix win on July 6.I dont see any reason against him being considered as one of the co-favourites. Ralf is right up there.Ralf has won the last two races for Williams and is also the only driver to have finished every race in the points so far. His form, after a disappointing start to the season, has helped blow open the title race and silenced critics who only a month ago questioned the Germans ability and desire to win after he trailed Michael home in Canada without attempting to overtake.Ralf remains 11 points adrift of Michael, with McLarens Kimi Raikkonen sandwiched between the brothers ahead of Sundays British Grand Prix, but several pundits already consider him a good bet for the title.He has his best chance yet, although recently he has played down expectations.These chances are very small and I dont even dream about it, Ralf said. The 11-point advantage Michael has is too much and as a result it will be very hard to close the gap.But if we keep working as concentrated as we did the last few races, it could be very interesting. Lets wait for the next two or three races and then Ill be able to tell you more.Hungry for heroesGermans have grown accustomed to Ralf, 28, being in the slipstream of 34-year-old Michael, who still has by far the most fans in a country hungry for heroes.Tennis player Boris Becker boosted Germanys national pride with his Wimbledon exploits from the 1980s and Michael has done the same since he arrived in Formula One in 1991.The reaction to Ralf  Schumi II  is cooler and more like that to Michael Stich, Beckers German rival who beat him in one Wimbledon final.Ralf, in his seventh season in Formula One, rejects suggestions that he has finally moved out of Michaels shadow this year because he considers he has always been his own man.I guess Ive shown before that I have my own character and have long been trying to establish my own identity. This isnt something that happened this year, he said.He said that even though Michael was perhaps the best driver he had nevertheless been overtaken in the past and would be overtaken and beaten in the future too.Will Schumi be able to handle Ralfs success? asked top-selling daily Bild after Magny-Cours, one of several newspapers having a Schumacher field day.Ralf and his Cora are the Beckhams of Formula One, declared Bild am Sonntag about Ralf and his wife.There has been much speculation about why Ralf, after trailing Michael for years, is now winning.Some point to their mothers death recently as a touching moment for Ralf, who was particularly close to her, while others suggest that he has been stung by criticism levelled at him earlier in the season.A more plausible explanation is Williams success in improving the aerodynamics of a car which already has Formula Ones most powerful engine.I wouldnt attribute it all to Ralf, Michael told Bild am Sonntag. Hes finally got a car he can get something out of.The relationship between the two may be changing on the track but it remains the same off it.We were fighting against each other in the last few years in Formula One and our relationship didnt change so I see no reason why it should change now, said Ralf. I love my brother even if Im battling him for the championship.The main difference appears to be that they discuss racing a lot less these days.We have been talking less about Formula One since Ive been in the same league as my brother, Ralf said.Ill give you an example. In Australia we went out for dinner and spent three hours together and I swear we didnt say a single world about Formula One. And that hasnt changed.  Copyright

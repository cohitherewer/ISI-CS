 Davison savours slice of history
Centurion: A little-known off-spinner who couldnt get a game in Australian domestic cricket smashed the fastest century in World Cup history on Sunday. Just four days after his team was routed for 36 by Sri Lanka, Canadas John Davison broke a series of batting records as he reached 100 off just 67 deliveries. It was the fastest-ever World Cup century, beating Indian Kapil Devs 1983-mark by five balls, and equalled the fifth quickest ton in ODIs. I had no idea (he had set the fastest hundred) until I looked at the scoreboard but it sent a shiver down my spine, the 32-year-old said. Once I hit the middle of the bat a few times I worked out it was a pretty good wicket, so I chanced my arm a bit. Davison finished with 111 from 76 balls in 98 minutes, striking eight fours and six sixes. Normally a spinner who bats at nine for South Australia, Davison was selected to play for Canada two years ago when they finished third at the 1999 ICC Trophy to qualify for the World Cup. I think someone read on the internet that I was born in Canada so they contacted me and asked me if I wanted to play. Davison helped Canada qualify for the World Cup but had to seek permission from South Australia to play in the tournament. His previous highest was 31 against Kenya earlier in the tournament.

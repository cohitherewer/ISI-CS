				 																																	Liverpool: Everton boss David Moyes fears teenage striker Wayne Rooney is in danger of burnout with a spell on the Goodison Park bench looming for English footballs hottest property. After his sensational arrival in the big time last year, the 18-year-old Rooney has struggled with his club this season, finding the back of the net only once and being substituted after just 55 minutes of Saturdays 0-2 defeat at Bolton.				 																																	Lets remember his age and what is expected of him, said Moyes. Hes a great player with great ability and potential so we will need to look after him. Maybe we have been playing him too much, maybe we have to look at it and say hes starting too many games and we are expecting too much of him. 				 																																	Moyes believes that Rooney, who used his day off last week to fly to Spain to film a soft drinks commercial, needs to be given space to develop and has called for Rooneymania to cool. 				 																																	Lisbon: Portuguese midfielder Hugo Viana plans to leave English Premiership side Newcastle United in the January transfer window. I dont feel well physically or mentally. My last two matches were dreadful. Ive got to find another club if I want to play in Euro 2004, he told the sports daily Record. Any club will do. I only want to play.				 																																	The 20-year-old attacking midfielder was bought from Sporting Lisbon in July 2002 but has played about 100 minutes this season in occasional appearances as a substitute for Newcastle. 				 																																	London: US sports baron Malcolm Glazer emerged on Monday as the buyer of a major stake in Premier League champions Manchester United, a deal that has stoked rumours he is intent on taking over the club. 				 																																	United said Glazer, owner of American Super Bowl champions the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, now had a 14.31 percent shareholding in one of the worlds richest clubs. United said at the weekend that it had recently met Glazer in the US to explain its strategy and financial results but gave no other details of the talks, described as part of a routine round of meetings with major shareholders.				 																																	Sydney: Australias former pole vault world record holder Emma George announced her retirement from athletics on Monday because of a chronic back problem.				 																																	George, 29, said she had been advised by doctors to retire after undergoing a series of operations.				 																																	My dream was to compete in Athens but I must also consider other aspects of my life and the severe risks involved with continuing to vault, she told reporters. This has been the most difficult decision of my life, but one which does not put my future health and mobility at jeopardy.				 																																	George set 17 world records during her career and won a gold medal at the 1998 Commonwealth Games.				 																																	Pune: A mini World Cup cricket meet for the disabled featuring six countries will be held in India in 2005, president of the All India Cricket Association for the Disabled, Ajit Wadekar said here on Monday.

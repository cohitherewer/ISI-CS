The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians will be hard to dislodge 
 Brett Lee is looking forward to playing in front of packed crowds Mumbai: Tearaway Australian quick Brett Lee said on Monday that it would be a real challenge to bowl against the strong Indian batting line-up in India during the tri-series from October 23-November 18. Lee, here as a brand ambassador for a watch company, said he has great respect for the Indian batsmen and enjoyed great camaraderie with them. Lee added he was looking forward to the challenge of bowling on Indian wickets. Though I am used to Indian conditions as I have come here with the under-19 team in 1994 and had a stint at the MRF Pace Foundation in Chennai three years later, the forthcoming tri-series would be a tough one, he said. The Indians have Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag and Sourav Ganguly who form a very strong batting line-up. It is hard to dislodge them on their own backyard, Lee said. On the ongoing sledging debate triggered by Sunil Gavaskar, Lee said, There is no harm in sledging provided one does not get too carried away. Everybody has the right to form his own opinion and Sunny has his own but sledging will be part and parcel of the game. On Indias tour of Australia later this year, Lee said, The Indians are always a tough side to beat. But we have a very fine pace attack, spearheaded by Glenn McGrath and supported by me, Jason Gillespie and Andy Bichel...It should be a very good series for both the sides. Lee said he was looking forward to bowl before the boisterous Indian crowd. It will be fantastic to play in front of a packed crowd. I enjoy the crowd though sometimes it can be unnerving... All in all it will be fun. We have been playing good cricket for the past one and a half years and if we continue to play in the same way we can do well in the tri-series which I am sure will be interesting, he added. Recalling the World Cup final, Lee said, It is not easy to chase a 350-target in the final of a World Cup and once we got Tendulkar out cheaply, we knew we had the Indians on the back foot and we could win. It was a special World Cup for me personally as it was my first World Cup and when we won it, it was like icing on the cake. (PTI)  Copyright

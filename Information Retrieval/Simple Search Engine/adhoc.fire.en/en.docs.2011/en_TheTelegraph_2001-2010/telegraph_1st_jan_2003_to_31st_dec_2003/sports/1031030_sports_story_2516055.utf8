 Svidler sets up date with Anand 
Cap DAgde: Russian champion Peter Svidler set up a semi-final clash with Viswanathan Anand after beating Bulgarian Veselin Topalov in the quarter finals of the World Rapid Chess championship here on Wednesday. Also making it to the last four was Russian Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk. He put up a fine performance against local star Etienne Bacrot. Grischuk will play compatriot and world No. 2 Vladimir Kramnik for a title-round berth. Anand and Kramnik had earlier made it to the semis with victories over world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine and the worlds top woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary with identical 1.5-0.5 margins. For Anand it will be a tough match as Svidler has been in great form in the past year. The Russian, who recently annexed the national title, is going great guns with a rapid rise in his Elo rating that has now reached a career-best 2723. He had been hovering around 2690 for the last three years and the recent surge has taken him to ninth in world rankings. (PTI)  Copyright

 Mexico pip Brazil to title
Mexico City: Mexicos substitute striker Daniel Osorno scored a delightful golden goal in extra time to give Mexico a 1-0 victory over Brazil in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final on Sunday. Osorno picked the ball up inside the area, skipped by two defenders and drilled the ball left-footed past Brazilian goalkeeper Gomes in the eighth minute of extra time. Fielding their under-23 team and without world-class players like Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, Brazil struggled throughout the final in the Azteca Stadium and Mexico fully deserved their triumph. Mexico had almost all of the play with Jesus Arellano hitting the crossbar and Brazilian goalkeeper Gomes doing well to deny Jared Borgetti and Luis Perez from close range in the first half. Pavel Pardo then went close with a curling free kick early in the second half but Gomes leapt high to his right to tip the ball around the post. Gomes again rescued the Brazilians in the 83rd minute, diving to stop a rasping long-range drive from Osorno. With the hosts firmly in control, the crowd chanted quot;Ole, Ole quot; as the Mexicans stroked the ball around. They had a great opportunity to win the game in the 89th minute when Juan Pablo Rodriguez rounded the Brazilian keeper but Borgetti failed to finish when the ball was played across the face of goal. Perez should then have scored in injury time when a cross from the right dropped at his feet but his first touch was poor and the ball rolled to safety. US finish third  Earlier on Saturday, Bobby Conveys first international goal proved to be a winning one as the United States came from behind to edge Costa Rica 3-2 in the third-place play-off match.

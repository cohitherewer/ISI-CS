The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BASA eyes foreign coach
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Bengal Amateur Swimming Association (BASA) is planning to rope in a foreign coach for the states swimmers. We have requested the sports ministry for financial help in this regard. We are basically eyeing someone from either China or Russia, a top BASA official said on Sunday. If we manage to rope in a foreign coach, but find it too difficult to meet his financial requirements, we may organise a month-long session for local coaches with him, he added. He also said that BASA will organise the national aquatics in the city from September 15 to 20, but the meet may go without any sponsors. We have approached a number of sponsors, but are yet to get a positive response from them, the official rued. Meanwhile, Hooghlys Somnath Addya and Umapada Naskar won the boys 1500 freestyle and 200 butterfly with new state record timings of 20:37.54 and 2:18.16, respectively, in the state aquatics (age-group) Sunday.

 Indian quartet in Singapore plans
New Delhi: Singapore will be looking to a quartet of Indian cricketers to take them to the 2011 World Cup. For a monthly salary of $2500, the four  Chetan Suryavanshi (18), Dharmichand Mulewa (21), Kiran Adhav (18) and Sagar Kulkarni (22)  have been recruited from Pune after a team of Singapore Cricket Association flew in on a talent hunt. The players will touch down in Singapore this week employed as coaches but will also double up as players as and when the need arises. The SCA is investing $600,000 over the next four years to get to the 2011 World Cup and the money will be spent on the four, who in turn are expected to give the game a much-needed boost in Singapore.

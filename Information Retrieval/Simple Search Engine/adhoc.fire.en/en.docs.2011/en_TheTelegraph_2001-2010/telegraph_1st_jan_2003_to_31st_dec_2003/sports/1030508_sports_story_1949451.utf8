 ACC plans an ice-breaking match
Dhaka: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is planning to organise an ice-breaking match between India and Pakistan in September as the diplomatic relations between the two countries appear to improve. We will try to organise an ice-breaking match in September this year provided India allow their team to play against Pakistan, said Syed Ashraful Huq, the ACC chief executive, Wednesday. He also added that the Asia Cup in April, 2004 may be shifted to its original venue  Pakistan. It may even be held in Pakistan, the original venue, instead of Sri Lanka ... But it all depends on a lot of things, Huq said during a brief stop-over in Dhaka en route to Malaysia, where the ACC is currently headquartered.  (AFP)  Copyright

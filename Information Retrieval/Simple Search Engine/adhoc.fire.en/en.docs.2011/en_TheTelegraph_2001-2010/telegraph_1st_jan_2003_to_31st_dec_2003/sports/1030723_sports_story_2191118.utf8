 SA hope Pollock is wrong again
 Pollock had predicted his team would win the ODI tri-series and lose the Test series London: Shaun Pollock predicted, on setting foot in England, that South Africa would win the one-dayers but lose the Tests. Having got the first part of that forecast spectacularly wrong, captain Graeme Smith and the rest of his team will be hoping Pollock proves equally inaccurate during the five-Test series starting on Thursday. The teams look so closely matched that the contest may depend in large measure on Pollock himself  and his availability  as well as that of Jacques Kallis. Both are established, world-class performers in young teams. Both also seem set to miss at least one match, for contrasting reasons. Kallis father is gravely ill with cancer, while Pollocks wife is expecting a baby. The fast bowler looks set to fly home during the fourth Test, leaving an already suspect attack short of a cutting edge. Kallis, meanwhile, is already at his fathers side. It might be a week, it might be a month, team media manager Gerald de Kock said. Hes not in our plans for the first Test at least. Kallis is one of the worlds leading allrounders as well as South Africas in-form batsman. He hit back-to-back centuries in the one-day tri-series against England and Zimbabwe, dedicating those innings to his father before closing the tournament with an average of 109.66. His absence will leave the tourists struggling for balance. Much may depend on the returning Gary Kirsten, the experienced left-handed opener. Lack of balance has been an English problem over recent years. Klusener shocked Meanwhile, Lance Klusener has described his omission from the squad for the England tour as a shock and disappointment. The 31-year-old is taking legal action against the UCBSA because he says he rejected the chance to play for English Counties after being assured of a place in the tour party. Its like your boss calling you on a Saturday night and saying, Sorry, old chap, but you dont have to come to work on Monday. Youre fired, Klusener was quoted as saying in the South African magazine You. Some people may think its sour grapes, but thats not true at all, added Klusener, the best player of the 1999 World Cup. England would have been a highlight for me. I wanted to play at Lords again. I played for South Africa with pride for eight years. I gave my all. Klusener, who has played 48 Tests and 154 one-day Internationals, has had a reputation as a loner. The new South Africa captain Graeme Smith described him as a disruptive force capable of ruining a team. Why is it if you dont want to be part of the crowd youre always seen as different? Klusener asked. Im a private person, I hate being around lots of people. Kluseners last appearance for South Africa was at this years World Cup, where they tied their final group game against Sri Lanka in controversial circumstances to exit the tournament at the first hurdle.

 Akram for promotion of cricket in the US 
 Akram will attend a dinner hosted by Detroit league Lahore: Wasim Akram said on Tuesday he will visit the United States next week to help spur the growth of the game there. I am going to the United States to attend a dinner by Detroit league on September 28. I feel that former players like me can contribute in the promotion of cricket in the US, said the record-breaking former Pakistan skipper, who retired last month. Last year too, I visited the United States and noticed a lot of interest in cricket there and it could be further promoted. The International Cricket Council (ICC) intends to stage a few matches of the 2007 World Cup, hosted by the West Indies, in the US. Expatriates from Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka have formed cricket clubs across the US and the national team also took part in the ICC Trophy two years ago. The 37-year old Pakistani pace bowler, with 502 wickets in 356 one-day Internationals -- both world records  and 414 Test wickets announced his retirement from international cricket last month after a career spanning 19 years. I am enjoying life after retirement and this is the first time that I have come home with no pressure of performing and playing, this is something very different, said Akram.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Sachin gets his Ferrari, at last
Mumbai, Aug. 9 (PTI): Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar got his much-awaited and talked about Ferrari 360 Modeno on Saturday after the finance ministry exempted 120 per cent of the import duty. Tendulkar, who went for a drive after he received the car transported by an Air France flight from Paris, refused to comment on his new vehicle. The finance ministry earlier this week had exempted around Rs 1.13 crore towards the import duty of the Red Ferrari, valued at Rs 75 lakh. The car was gifted to Tendulkar by Fiat after the Mumbai batsman equalled late Don Bradmans tally of 29 Test centuries. Formula One champion Michael Schumacher had presented the car on behalf of the company to Tendulkar when the two met at Silverstone last year.  Copyright

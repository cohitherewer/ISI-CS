The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Soma unlikely to make the cut
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Qualifying mark too high for Soma Calcutta: The world athletics championship is likely to stay a dream for Soma Biswas. She is taking part in the Federation Cup in Hyderabad and according to sources, cant meet the qualifying mark of 6019 points in heptahlon. She has a groin injury and with the qualifying mark being raised from the expected 5800-level, its difficult for her, said the source. Its unlikely that any Indian heptahlete will make the cut. Before leaving for Hyderabad, Soma didnt know that the qualifying mark would be well above what she thought. She had said she wasnt in very good shape, but was still hoping to score around 5700-5800. K.M. Beenamol, Saraswati Saha, Bobby Aloysius are also skipping the Federation Cup, knowing that they will not make the cut for the world championship to be held in Paris from August 23-31. Its unlikely that India will send more than two-three entries to Paris. In that case, Anju Bobby George (long jump) and Neelam J. Singh (discus) are the frontrunners, said the source. Gold for Archana PTI adds: Bengals Archana Mondal won the shot put gold in the Federation Cup in Hyderabad with a heave of 11.50m. Mukti Saha came second in womens 400m at 54.01 seconds, while Harishankar Roy claimed the silver in high jump.  Copyright

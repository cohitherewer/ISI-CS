The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Support for John Buchanan
 - Aussie coach admits there has been drama over past few days  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Everybody appreciates  John Buchanan has the right to offer whatever feedback  he deems fit  Steve Waugh heads  the list of top 
 Australian earners Melbourne: If John Buchanan felt uncomfortable  when his rather stinging letter to each of the XII players  in Adelaide leaked, at the weekend, he should now be feeling  much better: Be it Steve Waugh or Ricky Ponting, nobody  is questioning either the contents or his motive. Moreover,  everybody appreciates that he has the right to offer whatever  feedback he deems fit. For his part, though, Australias  coach isnt saying anything. Yes, theres been some drama  over the past few days  at least, thats the impression   but, frankly, I dont wish to make any comment, he told  The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. But even if Buchanan isnt adding to what he wrote, the letter is likely to do more good than harm. After all, the bit about personal sponsorships and appearances for the teams sponsors is something which needed to be discussed, as a source put it. Apparently, theres unhappiness among the top players that they repeatedly get saddled with making appearances on behalf of the team. For good reasons, the sponsors want the biggest names but, then, that eats into the limited time on hand for the Adam Gilchrists and Pontings. Given that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between CA and the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) will have to be renewed in 2005, theres enough time to thrash out an issue which is causing discontent and is a distraction. The obligations get defined in the MoU. It will be interesting if Buchanan is somehow involved in the process. Incidentally, addressing the matter head-on, Steve has gone on record to say: A lot is expected of the players... You just have to deal with what is in front of you in the best way you can. Its a sensible piece of advice from the outgoing captain. Meanwhile, according to The Age, Steve heads the list of top earners with (Australian) $4 million. He is followed by: Gilchrist ($ 3 million); Ponting ($2.5 million); Matthew Hayden and Brett Lee ($ 2 million each); Damien Martyn ($ 1 million); Justin Langer ($ 800,000); Andy Bichel ($ 700,000); Stuart MacGill, Simon Katich and Brad Williams ($ 600,000 each); Nathan Bracken ($ 500,000).  Darren Lehmann and Jason Gillespie arent in that  list, while Shane Warne  currently serving a one-year ban  for drug abuse  wasnt taken into account when the approximate  annual earnings were calculated.

				 	 Pakistans Taufeeq Umar en route to his 135 in Cape Town on Saturday, Day III of the second Test against South Africa. (AFP)																								Cape Town, Jan. 4 (Reuters): South Africa are set to become the first side to displace Australia at the top of the world Test championship after moving to the brink of victory over Pakistan in the second Test on Saturday.																								Pakistan were struggling at 184 for five after following on at close on the third day.																								The tourists were dismissed for 252 in their first innings in reply to South Africas 620 for seven, still 368 runs behind.																								South Africa lead the two-match series 1-0 and a victory at Newlands would put them ahead of Australia, who have led the Test championship since it was inaugurated in May 2001.																								The home side capped a fine day on the field in the final over when Yousuf Youhana was caught at long on by Jacques Kallis off Nicky Boje for 50, scored off only 29 balls with six fours and two sixes. It was the second fastest Test half-century of all time.																								Earlier, Pakistan lost their final six first innings wickets for the addition of just 12 runs in the space of 44 balls as Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini ripped through the middle and lower order leaving them 169 short of the follow on target of 421.																								Pollock finished with four for 45 and Ntini four for 62 after fast bowler Mornantau Hayward removed Inzamam-ul Haq and Youhana in the space of two balls just before lunch.																								Only opener Taufeeq Umar offered any resistance to the bowling, scoring a career best 135 off 253 balls with 20 fours and a six.																								He then added 67 in the second innings as he and Inzamam put on 121 for the third wicket. Umar was dropped with the first ball of the innings though, when a thick edge to third slip off Pollock was put down by Boeta Dippenaar. Their partnership came to an end when Boje got a ball to turn and bounce deceiving the advancing Inzamam, who was stumped by Mark Boucher for 60.																								With the first ball of the next over, bowled by Pollock, Umar got a faint edge where Boucher completed a regulation catch. 																								Youhana then decided to go on the offensive taking 24 off one Boje over.

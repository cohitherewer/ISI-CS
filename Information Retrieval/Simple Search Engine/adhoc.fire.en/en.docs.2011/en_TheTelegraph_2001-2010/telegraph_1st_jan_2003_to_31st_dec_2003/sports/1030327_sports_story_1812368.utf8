 Rohan skips tie for knot
 Rohan: Out of Duleep Trophy match Vijayawada: Former India keeper M. S. K. Prasad will lead Elite B in the absence of Rohan Gavaskar, who is getting married on April 2, in their Duleep Trophy match against Elite C starting Thursday. Meanwhile, Elite C, led by Shiv Sunder Das, has several top players like Jacob Martin, Nilesh Kulkarni, Pankaj Dharmani and Yere Goud in their ranks. On the other hand, Elite B, too, have a strong line up with the likes of Wasim Jaffer, S. Bahutule, Amit Pagnis and Vinayak Mane. Harvinder Singh replaces an injured Orissa paceman Debashish Mohanty while Gynanendra Pandey fills in for Rohan. Meanwhile, reinforced by the inclusion of former India medium pacer Venkatesh Prasad, a confident Plate B take on Elite A in another match at Bangalore. Elite A, too are determined to make amends after failing to impress in the first two encounters. Prasad, who has replaced S. Dhahad in the squad, is likely to take the place of C. Atram in the final XI. Plate B, led by J. Arun Kumar, is high on confidence following their innings victory in the last match against Plate A. They have 11 points from two outings  eight from the victory and a draw against Elite B. Elite A had conceded first innings leads in both their previous engagements and have six points. S. Sriram, stand-in captain for the injured Reetinder Singh Sodhi, is in superb form with two back-to-back centuries. In the bowling department, its upto medium-pacers Irfan Pathan (jr) and Ranadeb Bose to deliver the goods. However, the Bengal boys did not have too much of an impressive run till now. Devang Gandhi and Deep Dasgupta failed with the bat in the earlier match. So, its about time that they deliver. The bowlers performance, too have not been overtly impressive. While Ranadeb started well in the first match, he couldnt keep up the good work. Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Sourashish Lahiri have also been far from impressive. Veteran spinner Narendra Hirwani has been the real surprise of the tournament so far. In the last match for Elite B, he took 12 wickets that enabled his team to the convincing innings victory.

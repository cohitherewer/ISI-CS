The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Liverpool may cancel China trip
Liverpool: Liverpool are likely to cancel their post-season tour of Hong Kong and China in July because of the SARS outbreak, the club said Sunday. Everton and Aston Villa have already withdrawn from Asian tours because of the spread of the disease. Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry said the likelihood of going to China in its current state was very, very remote. Obviously we are concerned about the problems that the SARS outbreak has caused and were monitoring the situation daily, Parry said. Were not rushing into making a decision but well have to make one by the middle of May because we need some certainty. Liverpool were scheduled to play a Shanghai XI July 4 and a Hong Kong select team three days later.  (AP)  Copyright

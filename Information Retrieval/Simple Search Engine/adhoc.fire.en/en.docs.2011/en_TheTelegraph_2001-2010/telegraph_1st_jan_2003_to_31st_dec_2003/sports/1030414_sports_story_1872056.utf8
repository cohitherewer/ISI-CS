 Maher to join squad in WI
Sydney: Jimmy Maher will join the Australian team in the West Indies to give wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist a rest, the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) announced on Sunday. ACB chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said Maher would arrive in the Caribbean in time for Australias match against a University of West Indies XI in Barbados, beginning on April 26. Maher was a member of the World Cup-winning Australian but missed out on the Test squad. However, the Queensland captain was certain to make the Australian one-day squad to play the West Indies as soon as the Test series was over. We are not necessarily saying that Jimmy is the countrys second-best wicketkeeping option, Hohns said in a statement. But for this match we would rather introduce a player who is going to be with the team for the duration of the trip, rather than fly someone across for a few days. Hohns said Gilchrist needed a short break after an exhausting schedule in recent months.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

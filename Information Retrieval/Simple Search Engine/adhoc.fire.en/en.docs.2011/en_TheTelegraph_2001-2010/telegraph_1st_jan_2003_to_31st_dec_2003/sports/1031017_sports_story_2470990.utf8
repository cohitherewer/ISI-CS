 Hogg to replace MacGill
Sydney: Australian leg-spinner Stuart MacGill was ruled out on the eve of the second Test against Zimbabwe starting on Friday after failing a fitness test. MacGill was replaced by Brad Hogg in one of three changes to the Australian team that crushed Zimbabwe by an innings and 175 runs in last weeks first test in Perth. Fast bowler Brad Williams was selected to make his Test debut after Jason Gillespie was ruled out with a torn muscle and middle-order batsman Simon Katich replaced the injured Darren Lehmann. MacGill injured his calf while bowling in the first Test but was hopeful of recovering in time for the second match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Hes a pretty tough sort of character but I think he probably realised today it was beyond him, Australia captain Steve Waugh said. He did have a separation in the muscle, which is a slight tear, and as a bowler you cant really carry that into a game. Hogg has played three previous Tests for Australia and was a member of the one-day team that won this years World Cup but this will be his first Test on home soil. Katich will also be playing his first game at home after his only previous Test appearance on the 2001 Ashes tour of England. He was called up after Lehmann was ruled out with an Achilles problem. I think hes a quality inclusion, Waugh said of Katich. Simons bowling came in to the equation in this Test match. Batting-wise Martin (Love) would have been in the next-best option.  Williams earns his first cap after  the injury-prone Gillespie strained a muscle in Perth. Williams  was 12th man in that match and his promotion allowed Nathan  Bracken to come into the squad.

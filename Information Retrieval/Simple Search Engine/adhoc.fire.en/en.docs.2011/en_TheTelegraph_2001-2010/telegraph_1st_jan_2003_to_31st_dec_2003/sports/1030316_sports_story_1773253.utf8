The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Olonga listens to voice of conscience
 Olonga: Retires from international cricket East London: Zimbabwe fast bowler Henry Olonga announced his retirement from international cricket on Saturday after his teams final match in the World Cup. In a statement Olonga said his decision had been a matter of personal conviction and added he believed it might be dangerous for him to return to Zimbabwe in the current political climate. It is with great sadness that I am officially announcing my retirement from international cricket, Olonga said. My continued involvement with the Zimbabwean team has become untenable. The stand I took earlier in the World Cup has undoubtedly had repercussions that have affected both my career and my personal life. I have received threatening e-mails which, I believe, make it dangerous for me to return to Zimbabwe. I was never under the illusion that my stand would have no consequences but I believe that one should have the courage of ones convictions in life and do all one can to uphold them. I believe that if I were to continue to play for Zimbabwe in the midst of the prevailing crisis I would do so only by neglecting the voice of my conscience. Meanwhile, a very sad Andy Flower on Saturday recalled his batting exploits in India and regretted he would not get any more chance to play there. I had some great trips to India. It is a great place to play cricket, the Zimbabwean batsman said. Flower, 34, issued a statement during his final match, the Super Six clash at Buffalo Park. For the last 13 years it has been an honour and a privilege to represent my country. However, it is now time for my family and me to move on. Perhaps, in the years to come, I will be able to play a role in the cricketing fortunes of Zimbabwe. To all Zimbabweans who have supported me from my debut until today I want to say thank you.  I always find it strange when people say they have no regrets about what they have done in the last 20 years, said Flower. I have made mistakes both on and off the field but I have kept learning.

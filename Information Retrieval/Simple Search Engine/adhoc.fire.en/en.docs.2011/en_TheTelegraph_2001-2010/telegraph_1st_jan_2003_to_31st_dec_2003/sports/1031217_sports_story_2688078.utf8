 Victory keeps Dempo on top
Margao: Dempo SC maintained their top spot edging past Hayward 2000 Sporting Club by a solitary goal in another National League match on Tuesday. Dempo scored the all important goal in the 34th minutes. Defender Stanley Colaco floated a ball to Sunday Seah off a free-kick. Seah deftly controlled the ball and his subsequent curling shot dipped to the far end of the right post beating rival keeper all ends up. Sporting Club made desperate attempts in the closing stage but failed to find the equaliser. Dempo remained at the top of the table with 10 points from four matches while Sporting Club have so far collected four points from as many matches. (PTI)  Copyright

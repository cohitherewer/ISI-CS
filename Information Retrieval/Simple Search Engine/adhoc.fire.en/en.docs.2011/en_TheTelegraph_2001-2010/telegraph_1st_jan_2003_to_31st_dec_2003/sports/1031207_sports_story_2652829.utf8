The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly battle to another draw
Margao, Dec. 6 (PTI): Akeem Abolanles goal helped Tollygunge Agragami to a creditable 1-1 draw against Dempo in a National League tie on Saturday. The local favourites moved ahead in 40th minute through Francis Silveira. Tollygunge who had earlier held Churchill in Goa, equalised seconds from the whistle. Defender Ebea Barobaro essayed a high cross and Akeem volleyed home to the delight of teammates. The Calcutta team, who many thought would fight to avoid relegation this time, now have two precious points from two away matches. Dempo have four from two. In Chennai, Churchill beat Indian Bank 1-0. Yusif Yakubu scored. On Sunday, Mohammedan Sporting run into Salgaocar in Goa. It wil be a tough match for the Calcutta team to say the least. Not just because Salgaocar beat East Bengal in their first match, but also because of the fact that the Goans are a neat and compact side with some allround ability to boast of.  Rennedy uncertain Mohun Bagan captain Rennedy Singh is uncertain for Wednesdays match against Tollygunge, adds A Staff Reporter. He is yet to recover from a hamstring injury which forced him out of the match versus Mahindra.  Copyright

 Sorry for Rio: Eriksson
 - United describe severity of ban as savage  Rio Ferdinand after being handed the eight-month ban in Bolton on Friday. (Reuters) London, Dec. 20 (Reuters): England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said he felt sorry for Rio Ferdinand on Saturday but respected the decision to ban the Manchester United defender for eight months for missing a drugs test (as reported briefly in Saturdays Late City edition). Eriksson will be without one of his first-choice centre-backs for the Euro 2004 finals unless Ferdinand manages to reduce his ban and 50,000 ($88,310) fine on appeal. With regard to Rio, Im sorry for him. Im sure he will be disappointed to miss football for eight months and Im sure he will see it as a blow to miss Euro 2004, Eriksson said. But I must respect the (disciplinary) commissions decision. Eriksson had been critical of the drawn out process that led up to this weeks two-day hearing in front of an independent disciplinary panel in Bolton. Meanwhile, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson must decide whether Ferdinand is in the right frame of mind to play against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday after the defender was banned for eight months over a missed drugs test. The severity of the ban, described as savage by United, has left a question mark over Ferdinands readiness for top level soccer even though he can play until January 12 when the suspension comes into force. The British media on Saturday were almost united in shock at the severity of the penalty. Some drew attention to the fact that Ferdinands ban was longer than that handed out in Italy to Dutch players Edgar Davids and Jaap Stam after they tested positive for nandrolone. Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich was banned for nine months in April for testing positive for cocaine while at Chelsea. Fifa, meanwhile, remained silent. Fifas head of communciations Markus Siegler said on Saturday that the ruling body would not comment until it had received all the documentation on the case from the FA next week.  Copyright

London, July 12 (AFP): Kents Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Sami destroyed Nottinghamshire Friday with a second-innings haul of seven for 50 to finish the County championship match with a bag of 15 in his teams 287-run win. The 22-year-old had taken eight for 64 in the first innings as Nottinghamshire crashed to 156 all out in reply to Kents first innings total of 362 at Maidstone. Sami finished with match figures of 15 for 114. Sami will play for Kent until August when he will be replaced by Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan. Leicestershire are still not out of the woods in a game against Middlesex at Southgate.

 Proceedings against me eyewash: Azhar
 Hyderabad: Terming the disciplinary proceedings against him as an eyewash, former Indian skipper Mohammed Azharuddun told a city court that the BCCI was prejudiced and pre-determined to implicate him in the match-fixing case. Azhar said he was meted out a raw deal by board and accused former CBI joint director K. Madhavan, who probed the scandal, of lacking in adequate knowledge for conducting disciplinary proceedings. A.C. Muthaiah (then BCCI president) and Madhavan had pre-decided to implicate me and the entire disciplinary proceeding, was as an eyewash, Azhar said. He alleged that Madhavan had also turned down his request to take the assistance of a lawyer during the inquiry proceedings conducted at Hyderabad. He also accused the former CBI director of leaking out information to the press, furnished by him during the inquiry proceedings.  (PTI)  Copyright

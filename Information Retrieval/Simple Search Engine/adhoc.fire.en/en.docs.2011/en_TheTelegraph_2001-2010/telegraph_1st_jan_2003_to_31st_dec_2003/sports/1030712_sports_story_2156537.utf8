 Arjun Atwal pulls out with bad back
Loch Lomond: Indias Arjun Atwal pulled out of the Scottish Open on Friday claiming a bad back after his first round 80. Former US Open champion Retief Goosen and former US Masters champion Ian Woosnam also withdrew, citing back problems. Goosen, who had laboured to a five-over par 76 in his first round, lasted just three holes into his second before calling it a day. Woosnam lasted three holes of his second round. He was six over for the tournament when he decided to stop. Norways Henrik Bjornstad (back) and Britains Warren Bennett (wrist) also withdrew from the tournament on Friday, while Swedens Henrik Stenson was disqualified after playing the wrong ball on his 10th hole, the par-four first, on Thursday.

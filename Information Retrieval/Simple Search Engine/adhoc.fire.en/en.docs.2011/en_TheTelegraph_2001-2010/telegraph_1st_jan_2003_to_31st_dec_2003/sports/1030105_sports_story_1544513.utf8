																								Stockholm, Jan. 4 (AP): Defending champion Thomas Johansson has withdrawn from the Australian Open because of a knee injury. Johansson told Tabloid Expressen that his ailing knee wouldnt recover in time for the Grand Slam tournament starting January 13 in Melbourne.																								The knee is better but not well enough that I can train. And if its not good enough for training then of course I cant play a match, Johansson said.																								The 27-year-old Swede has been plagued by injuries since winning the Australian Open in 2002. He was being treated for a knee injury that flared up in November, but said on Friday that he wouldnt recover in time to defend his title.

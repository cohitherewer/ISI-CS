 Mexico set up Brazil date

Gonzalezs first error came when he misjudged a deep cross from Mexican captain Rafael Marquez in the 19th minute and flapped the ball into his own net. Marquez said his goal was one of the weirdest he had ever scored. I wanted to put over a centre and I surprised him and also surprised myself, said Marquez, who sat out the second half on the bench with an ice pack over his left knee after picking up a slight injury. The Costa Rican keeper compounded the mistake by spilling a low-driven free kick by Rafael Garcia that allowed striker Jared Borgetti to tap in the rebound with Gonzalez floundering on the floor, giving Mexico a 2-0 lead in the 28th minute. The bizarre first goal took the wind out of Costa Rica who until then had created the better chances. In a five-minute spell, the busy Walter Centeno hit the bar with a long range shot with Mexican goalkeeper Oswaldo Sanchez beaten. Centeno, who plays with AEK Athens, then drove another shot just wide of the right hand post. Costa Rican striker Winston Parks whipped a right foot shot across the Mexican goal that Sanchez palmed wide.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Greene at it again
Los Angeles: Olympic champion Maurice Greene signalled he will not give up his world 100m title without a fight when he clocked 9.94 seconds, the years second-fastest time, to win the Los Angeles Invitational Sunday. Everybody was saying Im done, Im through, Im finished, Im washed up, Greene said. But who cares. No matter what the headlines say, you have to go to the line and be ready to run. This is the start of my year. Only Australian Patrick Johnson has run faster this year, clocking 9.93 seconds. American Tim Montgomery holds the world record of 9.78 seconds.  J. J. Johnson placed second in 10.05, with Shawn Crawford third in 10.10. Greene had predicted he would defend his world 100m title and win back the 200m crown in August. (Reuters)  Copyright

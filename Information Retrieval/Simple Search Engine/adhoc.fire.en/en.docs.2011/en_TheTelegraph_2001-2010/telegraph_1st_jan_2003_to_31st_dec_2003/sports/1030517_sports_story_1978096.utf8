 Yuvraj debut delayed
London: A visa problem has delayed Yuvraj Singhs debut for Yorkshire, the county said Friday. The Indian star was due to arrive at Headingley Friday but the delay means he may not be able to represent the county until after this weekend. In that case, the 21-year-old will play his first county match against Glamorgan  a second division four-dayer, starting Wednesday. (AFP)  Copyright

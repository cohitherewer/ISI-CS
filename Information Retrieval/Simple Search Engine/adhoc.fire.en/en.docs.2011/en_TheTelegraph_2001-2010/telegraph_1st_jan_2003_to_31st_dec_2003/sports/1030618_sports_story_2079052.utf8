The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Plea to ignore specific statements
Hyderabad: Former cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin on Tuesday pleaded before the City Civil Court that written statements filed by K. Madhavan, the Board of Control for Cricket in India-appointed investigator in the match-fixing scandal, and former BCCI chief A.C. Muthiah, be ignored. On Monday, Azhars counsel had claimed that Madhavans appointment was illegal as the BCCI bye-laws had no provision for the appointment of an outside agency to probe into allegations of irregularities against a cricketer.

 Sarwan heroics in vain, Lankans win a thriller
 - Loss puts West Indies almost out of contention  Sanath Jayasuriya en route to his 66 in Cape Town Friday. (AFP) Cape Town: Sri Lanka did not quite recover from their batting woes when they toiled to 228 for six off 50 overs in their World Cup match against West Indies Friday. With a loss against Kenya still fresh in the memory of the Lankans, a victory in this game is absolutely vital to keep them in reckoning for a Super Six berth. West Indies fell short of the target by six runs, with Ramnaresh Sarwan, who came back after retiring hurt, stranded on 47. Chris Gayle scored 55. They were all out for 222.Chaminda Vaas (4/22) was most successful bowler. While history favours teams batting first in day-nighters at Newlands, the former world champions had to settle for a relatively ordinary score after a sloppy batting performance that included two run-outs. Captain Sanath Jayasuriya scored a patient 66 to prop up the innings but did not get the support he needed, with only two other players getting past 30. West Indies, needing to win to have a real hope of making the Super Sixes, produced their best performance with the ball since beating South Africa in the opening game of the tournament but were assisted by some poor batting. Opener Maravan Atapattu (three) was run out in the fourth over of the day when attempting a suicidal single, then Aravinda de Silva, looking in fine form, went the same way after a terrible mix-up with his skipper that saw both batsmen stranded at the same end on the third run. Jayasuriya and Hashan Tillekeratne shared a second-wicket partnership of 85 before the latter, hitting across the line, was clean bowled by medium pacer Wavell Hinds for 36 when set for a big score. Jayasuriya, who scored a hundred against New Zealand and an unbeaten half-century century against Bangladesh, put together an uncharacteristically cautious fifty before throwing his wicket away out of frustration. He had a lucky escape on 59, when apparently gloving a catch to wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs, he was given the benefit of the doubt by South African umpire David Orchard. Seven runs later, though, he holed out to Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the deep after a 99-ball knock featuring just four boundaries. (Reuters)  Copyright

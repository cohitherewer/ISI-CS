The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hattrick by Cyril Ekka
Mumbai: Forward Cyril Ekkas hattrick helped Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Chandigarh score their first win in the quarter final league when they beat giant-killers Bhopal XI 3-0 in the 41st Bombay Gold Cup hockey meet at the Mahindra Stadium here on Wednesday. However, despite this victory CISF could not make it to the semi-finals as Indian Oil and Karnataka XI have already made the last four. In the pool A game, CISF took the lead in the 25th minute when Ekka converted a penalty stroke. The stroke was awarded after Bhopal defender Mansoor Ali stopped a goal bound ball. With two minutes to go for half time Ekka increased the lead off an S. K. Kiro cross and with eleven minutes to go for the final whistle Ekka hit yet another field goal. CISF forced just three penalty corners, conceding five. Indian Oil pipped Karnataka XI 2-1 to top pool A. Indian Oil surged ahead in the 12th minute through Prabhjot Singhs field goal. Eight minutes later Karnataka equalised when centre forward Ajay Aiyappa flicked home a Laxman Rao pass. However, seven minutes after the breather Prabhjot scored the decider. (PTI)  Copyright

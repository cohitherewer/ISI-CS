 Sunita Rani lashes out at Jyotirmoyee
 New Delhi: Distance runner Sunita Rani lashed out at Jyotirmoyee Sikdar following the return of her Busan Asian Games medals Tuesday. Jyotirmoyee, a former Asian Games gold medallist had called for strictest punishment for Sunita after she tested positive during the Games last year. Jyotirmoyee never realised the injustice that was being meted out to an innocent fellow athlete. She forgot that it was me who helped her win a medal in 1998, Sunita said. However, I dont hold anything against her anymore, she added. Recalling the trauma, Sunita said: Every morning was a harbinger of death. My life ceased to have any meaning or purpose. Since sports is my life, I thought it was impossible to live with this ignominy, she added.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Martyn has no regrets
Cairns: Australian batsman Damien Martyn said Wednesday he had no regrets batting with a broken finger in the World Cup final despite the fact the decision led to a four-month injury lay-off. Martyn went into the World Cup final against India in Johannesburg last March knowing he had a broken finger  sustained in the semi-final against Kenya  and made 88 not out in a match-winning partnership of 224 with skipper Ricky Ponting. The defending champions became the first team to win three World Cups when they beat India by 125 runs in a one-sided final at the Wanderers. By playing, Martyn further damaged the finger, which ended up looking like an eggshell with five small fractures. After four months on the sidelines and with his smashed right index finger still heavily taped, Martyn hopes to return to one-day cricket this weekend when Australia take on Bangladesh in a one-day double-header here.  Even if Id known what was going to happen I wouldnt change it at all, Martyn said. The World Cup final was the biggest highlight of my life  the frustrating thing is that I didnt think Id be out for so long, I thought it would be two or three weeks or a month. Instead he had to undergo an operation and it was more than two months before he could hold a cricket bat, let alone hit balls and catch. Its been a long slow process of rehab and waiting for the joint to mend. Ill never have full movement in it and in old age itll be a bit arthritic. In that sense the fingers good now, Im just rusty cricket-wise. Ive just got to focus on getting picked this weekend and whatever happens down the track is what happens, he said. (AFP)  Copyright

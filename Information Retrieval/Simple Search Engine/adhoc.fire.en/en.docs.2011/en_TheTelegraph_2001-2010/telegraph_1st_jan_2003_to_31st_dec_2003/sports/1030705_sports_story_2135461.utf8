 India A in 7-wkt win
London: Rohan Gavaskar cracked an unbeaten century as India A cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Nottinghamshire in a rain-affected three-day game at Trent Bridge on Friday after both sides forfeited one of their innings. Gavaskar struck 139 not out from 181 balls with 17 fours and four sixes to lead India A to 341 for three, past the Nottinghamshire total of 339. With the match looking doomed for a draw after the entire second days play being washed out due to rain on Thursday, the two sides decided to forfeit one of their innings to force a result. Nottinghamshire, who had closed the first day at 265 for three, declared their first innings at 339 for five and then forfeited their second innings. India A forfeited their first innings and started chasing a score of 340 in their second. Apart from Gavaskar, Satyajit Parab scored 90 with 16 fours while Ambati Tirupati Rayudu made 71 not out to contribute to India As victory. India A next play a one-day game against Leicestershire on Sunday at Grace Road.  (PTI)  Copyright

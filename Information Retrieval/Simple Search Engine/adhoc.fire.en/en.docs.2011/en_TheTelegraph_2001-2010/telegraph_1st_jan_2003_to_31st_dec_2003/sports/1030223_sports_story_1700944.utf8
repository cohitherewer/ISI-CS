 Solskjaer earns point for United 
London: Manchester United salvaged a point from what seemed a certain Premier League defeat at Bolton Wanderers on Saturday when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored in the last minute to secure a 1-1 draw at the Reebok Stadium. The Norwegian forced home a David Beckham cross to give United a point with just 15 seconds of normal time remaining after a superior Bolton had taken the lead when Bruno NGotty headed home a Youri Djorkaeff free kick after 61 minutes. Meanwhile, Arsenal roared five points clear at the top with a 5-1 thrashing of Manchester City. Goals by Dennis Bergkamp (4), Robert Pires (12), Thierry Henry (15) and Sol Campbell (19) ended the game as a contest almost before the players had even broken into a sweat. Patrick Vieira made it 5-0 after 53 minutes, as Citys defence was torn to shreds. The win, Arsenals best in the league this season, lifted the champions on to 60 points from 28 games, five points more than United. Another match between Everton and Southampton at Goodison Park ended in a dramatic 2-1 win for Everton with Canadian Tomasz Radzinski scoring twice in the last 10 minutes to grab all three points. James Beattie scred for Everton in 33 minutes. (Reuters)  Copyright

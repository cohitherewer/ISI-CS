The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inzy back in reckoning
 - Shoaib among probables after being released by Durham on special request  Shoaib had been asked to make himself available after Sami was ruled out with an ankle injury Karachi: Discarded batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq is back in the reckoning for Pakistans home cricket season after his inclusion by selectors on Tuesday in the 20 probables for the series against Bangladesh. The 33-year-old has been included in the squad announced for the three-Test series after being ignored for three one-day tournaments since the World Cup. But there was no place for former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis, who recently said he still wants to play for the country. We have named 20 players for now. But for the rest of the season there will be changes and more players would be considered, Sohail said. Pakistan takes on Bangladesh in the first of three Tests in Karachi from August 20. The series will be followed by five one-day Internationals before Pakistan hosts South Africa in three Tests and as many one-day games in September and October. They will also play New Zealand in five one-day games in November. Inzamam has scored and 6,214 runs in 85 Tests and 8,957 runs in 290 one-day Internationals, but was left out after a harrowing time at the World Cup when he managed just 19 runs in six innings. We had never dropped Inzy after the World Cup. We were just giving him a break from the game so that he could get over his fatigue and come back stronger, chief selector Aamer Sohail said. He should bring stability to the Pakistan middle order given his experience and class. Inzamam, who scored 329 runs against New Zealand in a Test against New Zealand at Lahore last year, was delighted to be recalled. It is a big relief to be back in the Pakistan squad. Hopefully I will get over the World Cup nightmare in the coming series, he said from Lahore. I was a bit disappointed on being out of the team but now I am ready for the home season. Never in this phase did I think of leaving cricket, I have a lot of it left in me, he said. The burly right-hander said he was hoping to continue playing for Pakistan for another two to three years. I dont think 10,000 runs in Tests and one-day Internationals is an impossible task, he added. Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar will also be available for the Bangladesh series after being released by his county Durham on a special request from the Pakistan Cricket Board. Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq was not considered for the series at his own request, although his English County Surrey had agreed to release him, Sohail said. Saqlain said he would come if absolutely necessary but we told him we could manage without him, he added. Pakistan had asked Saqlain and Shoaib to make themselves available after an ankle injury to fast bowler Mohammed Sami ruled him out of the series. Uncapped batsman Farhan Adil from Karachi is tipped to make his debut in the first Test while two other uncapped players selected are left arm pacer Mohammed Khalil and left arm spinner Abdul Sattar. The squad will go into a training camp in Lahore from August 9 to 16, and the 12 for the first Test will be announced on August 16.  THE SQUAD Mohammed Hafeez, Taufiq Umar, Yasir Hameed, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Yousuf Youhana, Misbahul Haq, Farhan Adil, Hasan Reza, Rashid Latif (captain), Shoaib Malik, Abdul Razzaq, Umer Gul, Shoaib Akhtar, Shabbir Ahmed, Mohammed Khalil, Najaf Shah, Danish Kaneria, Abdul Sattar, Kamran Akmal, Jaffer Nazir.

 United ready to sell Veron
London: Manchester United were reported Tuesday to be ready to sell Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron to either Inter Milan or Juventus. Manager Alex Ferguson was reported to have given up hope in the 29-year-old fulfilling his potential in the English Premiership two years after he paid Lazio 28 million for him. United are unlikely to get anything like that figure in a depressed market. Veron has three years remaining on his Old Trafford contract but has suggested he would be happier at Inter Milan or Juventus next season. I think I will be playing in Serie A next season, Veron told the Mirror. I am flattered that a few teams are looking at me. Big players are good in big teams. I would not have any problems playing for Hector Cuper (at Inter Milan) or Marcello Lippi (at Juventus). I will be the right man. Ferguson has already lined up Cameroons Eric Djemba Djemba as a replacement. The 22-year-old was expected to complete a 5 million move from French side Nantes next week after he finishes playing in the Confederations Cup in France.  (AFP)  Copyright

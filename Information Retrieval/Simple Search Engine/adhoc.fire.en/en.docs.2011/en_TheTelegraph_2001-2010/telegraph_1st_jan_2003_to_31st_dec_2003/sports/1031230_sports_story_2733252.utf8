The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Innings win for South Africa
 Brian Lara leaves the Kingsmead ground on Monday after being caught by Neil McKenzie in Durban for 11. (AFP) Durban: South Africa beat the West Indies by an innings and 65 runs on the fourth day of the second Test at Kingsmead here on Monday, despite fighting centuries by Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Vice captain Sarwan, who made 114, and Chanderpaul (109) both overcame injuries to delay South Africas seventh successive home Test win against the West Indies. South Africa took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the current four-match series. Sarwan needed treatment on the field after being hit on the back of his helmet by a bouncer from Makhaya Ntini when he was on 29, while Chanderpaul batted with a runner throughout his innings because of a strained left thigh muscle. South Africa, who had a 394-run first innings lead, seemed headed for an early win when they claimed the first four West Indian wickets, including that of captain Brian Lara, before lunch. But Sarwan played a courageous innings studded with flowing off-side drives. He reached his third Test century off 186 balls and batted for 312 minutes, faced 225 balls and hit 18 fours before he was bowled off an inside edge by Ntini. The left-handed Chanderpaul helped Sarwan put on 113 for the sixth wicket, a record for the West Indies against South Africa. Chanderpaul was only allowed to bat after the fall of the fifth wicket after being unable to field on the third day because of his thigh strain. Chanderpaul was on 58 when Sarwan was dismissed. Adam Sanford provided support as Chanderpaul went on the attack to reach his ninth Test hundred off 159 balls. With only three overs remaining in the day, South Africa gave notice they intended to claim the extra half hour allowed in order to press for a result. Chanderpaul smashed the last ball of the over from Ntini and Neil McKenzie leaped to hold the catch. It was Ntinis 58th wicket of the year and ensured he would finish as the worlds leading wicket-taker in 2003.  (AFP)  Copyright

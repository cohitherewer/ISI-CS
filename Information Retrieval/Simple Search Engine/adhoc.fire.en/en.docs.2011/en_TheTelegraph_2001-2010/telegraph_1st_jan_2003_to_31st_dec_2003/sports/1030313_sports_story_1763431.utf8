 Barcelona make last eight 
 - Newcastle, Roma snatch vital away  draws against Inter, Arsenal Arsenals Robert  Pires (left) and Fredrick Ljungberg look for an opening  in front of the Roma goal during their Champions League  match at Highbury in London Tuesday. (AP/PTI)  London: Barcelona beat  Bayer Leverkusen 2-0 to reach the Champions League quarter  finals on Tuesday but Inter Milan missed their chance to  join them from Group A after drawing 2-2 at home with an  inspired Newcastle United. No team qualified from Group B  after Arsenal were embarrassingly held 1-1 at Highbury by  an AS Roma side down to 10 men for nearly 70 minutes and  Ajax Amsterdam also drew 1-1 at home with Valencia in their  second-phase clash. Barcelona, who have won 12 and  drawn one of their 13 Champions League games this season,  became the third club to seal their place in the quarter  finals after AC Milan and Manchester United. Goals in each half from Javier  Saviola and Frank de Boer against a Leverkusen side who  have lost all five second-phase games ensured the Catalan  club a smooth passage to the last eight. Inter, on eight points, or Newcastle,  on seven, will follow them after the final round of matches   with the Italians travelling to Leverkusen, on zero points,  and Newcastle hosting manager Bobby Robsons former club,  Barcelona. Inters match at San Siro was  soured by racist taunts from the home supporters directed  at Newcastles black players, while a flare was thrown from  the second tier on to the visiting fans below. The racist  taunts came just a week after Uefa launched a new anti-racism  initiative in London. On the pitch, Inter needed to  draw on all their experience to cope with a determined display  from Newcastle, who were twice ahead through close-range  finishes from skipper Alan Shearer. But Christian Vieri scored his  first goal in Europe since December 2001 and Inters Colombian  defender Ivan Cordoba headed a second equaliser in the 61st  minute to send their qualifying hopes down to the wire next  week. Inter had crushed a 10-man Newcastle  4-1 in November but the return from suspension of Shearer  and his strike-partner Craig Bellamy, who was red-carded  in the match at St. James Park, transformed Robsons team. Group B is wide open with all  four teams still able to qualify for the last eight. Ajax  and Arsenal have seven points, while Valencia are on six  and Roma on four. Arsenal take their hopes to Valencia,  while Roma are at home to Ajax in next weeks final matches  of the second phase. Among the wealth of possible permutations,  the key for Ajax and Arsenal fans is that their teams need  only a draw to be sure of qualifying, while Valencia and  Roma both need to win. Victory looked to have been a  racing certainty for Arsenal Tuesday after skipper Patrick  Vieira headed them into an early lead and Roma skipper Francesco  Totti was shown the red card on 22 minutes for raising his  arm in an aerial challenge on defender Martin Keown. But  Antonio Cassano levelled in first-half stoppage time after  some woeful defending by an Arsenal side who have not won  at home in the Champions League since September. Arsenal then squandered a host  of chances as the scoring touch deserted Thierry Henry,  Dennis Bergkamp, Robert Pires, Francis Jeffers and Nwankwo  Kanu, while Roma nearly snatched a win through substitute  Vincenzo Montella in a late break. Ajax needed a second-half equaliser  from Petri Pasanen to earn a draw in a free-flowing match  at the Amsterdam Arena. Valencia, who reached the finals  of the Champions League in 2000 and 2001 took a first-half  lead when Kily Gonzalez converted from the penalty spot.  (Reuters) Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Douglas hits legal roadblock
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Douglas da Silva of East Bengal Friday suffered a mild setback, so to say, when he tried to board a British Airways flight from Dum Dum Airport en route to his home in Brazil. Lacking in vital papers that he should have submitted to immigration authorities, he was sent back and will now have to go through the formalities Monday. P.K. Chatterjee, DC Security Control, the agency that handles these immigration issues, told The Telegraph: Douglas came to India on a business visa. Hence he was required to file the requisite Foreigners Registration papers within six months of his arrival. However, it has been around eight months since his arrival and he hasnt filed those papers. I had to send him back. A number of details are needed for the filing of such papers, mostly supplied by the people or organisation keeping him, in this case East Bengal club. I have given Douglas fresh papers for this and with offices reopening Monday, he will have to submit them before he can take another flight back home, said Chatterjee. There was none from the club available, till late, to comment on this. Most foreign footballers in Calcutta have to mandatorily sign papers. The office has clamped down since those early days when players moved on student visas and stayed on to earn.  Copyright

 Wang Nan makes it three in row
 Austrian Werner Schlager dealt China a body blow by defeating reigning mens singles champion Wang Liqin in the table tennis world championships quarter finals in Paris Saturday. (AFP) Paris, May 24 (Agencies): Chinas Wang Nan became only the second player to win three world titles in succession when she beat compatriot and doubles partner Zhang Yining at the world table tennis championships on Saturday.Wang, world ranked number two, won 4-3 (11/7, 11/8, 11/4, 5/11, 6/11, 8/11, 11/5) against the current number one, a winner of two World Cups.The victory allowed her to emulate compatriot Chinese Deng Yaping, the only triple world champion before her in 1991, 1995 and 1997.However, the sports superpower has only one representative left in the hunt for the mens singles, with Olympic champion Kong Linhui in a semi-final match-up against Austrias Werner Schlager.Schlager prevailed over reigning mens champion Waqin Laqin in an epic seven setter.The second semi-final pits Greeces Kalinikos Kreanga against Koreas Joo Se-Hyuk, who shrugged off his underdog status to beat Chen Weixing, a Chinese export to Austria.Kreanga said: Lets hope theres at least one European in the final, I dont care whether its me or Werner!

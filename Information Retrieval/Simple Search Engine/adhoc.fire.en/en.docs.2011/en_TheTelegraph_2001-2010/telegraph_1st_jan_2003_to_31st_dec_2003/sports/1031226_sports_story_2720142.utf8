				 																																	Wellington: Yousuf Youhana happily tucked into a celebratory Christmas lunch on Thursday while his teammates barely batted an eyelid on the eve of Pakistans second cricket Test against New Zealand.				 																																	Vice-captain Youhana, the only Jew in the Pakistan squad, celebrated Christmas Day with his wife Tania and said there were never any problems with his teammates of Muslim faith who do not observe Christmas. I usually get cards from them and they always make it a special day for me, he said.				 																																	Youhana said the last time the team were in camp on Christmas Day, teammate Rashid Latif took him out for lunch to celebrate.				 																																	Otherwise it was a routine day for the tourists who had a relaxed morning before training at the basin reserve.				 																																	In the opposition camp, New Zealands cricketers played Santa Claus to make the day for some hospitalised children. Daniel Vettori, Lou Vincent and Ian Butler handed out gifts to children in Wellington Hospital.				 																																	Mexico City: Uruguayan Hugo de Leon has been named coach of Mexican first division club Monterrey where he will replace former Argentina captain Daniel Passarella.				 																																	De Leon came out top of a long list of candidates which also included former Real Madrid coach Vicente del Bosque and former Mexico coach Manuel Lapuente, the Notimex news agency said on Wednesday.				 																																	De Leon coached Nacional, where he also spent much of his playing career, in his homeland from 1999 to 2002 before leaving to take a coaching course. Passarella, who captained Argentina when they won the 1978 World Cup on home soil, was fired last Friday over what the club described as sporting differences.				 																																	He had been in charge of 18 months, during which he led Monterrey to only the second Mexican championship title in their history.				 																																	London: Midfielder Michael Brown will join Tottenham Hotspur from first division Sheffield United when the transfer window opens on January 1, the Premier League club said on Wednesday.				 																																	We are pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Sheffield United and Michael Brown for the player to join us on January 1, Spurs said in a statement on their website.				 																																	The 26-year-old midfielder, who began his career at Manchester City, has scored 28 goals in 142 league games for United.				 																																	Due to a four-match suspension, Brown will not be available to play for Spurs until their Premier League game against Liverpool on January 17. We are sorry to see him go but he does so with our blessing, said United manager Neil Warnock.				 																																	Newcastle: Newcastle manager Bobby Robson is refusing to allow Portuguese midfielder Hugo Viana to return to Sporting Lisbon on loan and will not review the decision until the end of next month at the earliest.				 																																	The 20-year-old joined the Premier League club in July 2002 for 8.5 million but has been unable to force his way into the first team on a regular basis.				 																																	I know he would like to go on loan but Im staying firm in keeping all the quality players,  Sport on Screen Cricket, Australia vs India, 3rd Test, Day I  live from 5.30am on STAR Sports

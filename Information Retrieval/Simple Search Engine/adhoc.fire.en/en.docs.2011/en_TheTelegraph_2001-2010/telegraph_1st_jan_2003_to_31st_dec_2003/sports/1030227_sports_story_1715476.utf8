 No mercy for Warne: Gilchrist
 Adam Gilchrist at a press conference with Warnes substitute Nathan Hauritz Wednesday. (AFP) Johannesburg: Shane Warne should expect no mercy after letting his fans down by failing the drug test, Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said Wednesday. Gilchrist said Warnes belated revelation that he took more than one look good tablet that led him to testing positive for banned diuretic substances would blur peoples perception of his case. I am not saying for one moment that Warney was intentionally doing that  I dont know the real circumstance surrounding that. I dont know all the fine details but there could easily be a perception that information had been withheld and when that does finally come out people can be put off by that. It can cloud peoples judgement of a certain person, Gilchrist said. Theres only one guy who knows what the truth is and hes got to live with that and its up to him whether he wants to tell anyone what it is, Gilchrist added. If indeed there has been information withheld or things not brought out that eventually do come out, he or his party around him have to be prepared to face up to it eventually. Gilchrist said he would not lose sleep over the latest revelations by his teammate. I am not going to toss and turn and think, what else is there? quipped Gilchrist. Its his prerogative to work out what he wants to say. Hes got to live with it being revealed or not. If he says its two now, well, again, Ill believe that. (PTI)  Copyright

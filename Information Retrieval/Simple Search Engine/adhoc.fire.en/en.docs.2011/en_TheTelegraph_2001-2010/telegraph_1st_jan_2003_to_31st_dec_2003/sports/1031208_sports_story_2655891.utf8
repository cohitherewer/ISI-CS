The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka A need 153
Mumbai: Sr Lanka A bundled out India A for 206 in the second innings to set themselves a victory target of 153 runs in the second Test at the Brabourne Stadium here on Sunday. Medium-pacer Tharanga Lakshita (three for 39) was the wrecker in chief. At stumps, the Lankans were six without loss. Earlier, left-hander Tilana Kandamby slammed 60 off 76 balls to give the visitors a vital 54-run first innings lead. India A had made 172 in the first innings. Skipper Naveed Nawaz (47) and Anushka Polonowita (42) started proceedings for Lanka A on Day II and added 67 runs in 19 overs for the fifth wicket. Then Kandamby, who was dropped twice, added another 62 runs with Omesh Wijesiriwardene (22) for the eighth wicket to lend respectability to the total. Kandamby was first dropped on one by Gautam Gambhir at point and then Murali Kartik floored a chance at mid-on on 53. However, medium-pacer Siddharth Trivedi came back to take three wickets in one over to bowl out the visitors for 226. India A, who won the first Test convincingly with left-arm spinner Kartik doing the star turn, face a tough task of defending their lead.  (PTI)  Copyright

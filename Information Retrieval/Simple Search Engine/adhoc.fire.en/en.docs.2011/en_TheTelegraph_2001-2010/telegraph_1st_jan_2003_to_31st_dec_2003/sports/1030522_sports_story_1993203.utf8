 Brazil remain clear leaders
Zurich: World champions Brazil remained clear leaders in the Fifa world rankings published on Wednesday after a quiet month on the international calendar. France were joined in second place by Spain, with Germany still fourth. The only other changes in the top 10 were Argentina (fifth) swapping places with the Netherlands (sixth) and Denmark moving up from 11th to joint 10th with the United States. England (seventh), Turkey (eighth) and Mexico (ninth) remained unchanged, while Costa Rica, up to 18th last month, climbed a further place to 17th, their highest ever position. The biggest movers were Georgia, who rose nine places to 84th following their 1-0 Euro 2004 qualifying victory over Russia on April 30. Bhutan moved into the top 200 for the first time, climbing five places to 195 thanks to a 6-0 victory over Guam in the Asian Nations Cup preliminary competition. India remained on 126, the spot they were in April when the last rankings were released. Montserrat remained 204th and bottom of the list, which is based on a rolling analysis of results over the last eight years weighted on the strength of the opponents and the importance of each match.

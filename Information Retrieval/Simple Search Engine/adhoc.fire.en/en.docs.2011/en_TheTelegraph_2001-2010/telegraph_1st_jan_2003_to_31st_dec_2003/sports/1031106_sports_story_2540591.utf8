The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Subroto Guha passes away
 - Given his talent, he should have achieved more: Chuni Goswami Mumbai: Former India and Bengal fast bowler Subroto Guha died following a massive heart attack at his residence here on Wednesday. He was 56 and is survived by his wife and two sons. According to his family members, Guha had a massive heart attack at 5 am and breathed his last before any medical assistance could be offered. Guha played four Tests for India between 1967-69 and took just three wickets. He had scored 17 runs and took two catches. He was a right-arm medium-pacer and a right-hand batsman coming lower down the order. He made his international debut against England at Leeds in 1967 and went on to play three more Tests against Australia with career-best figures of two for 55. Though he was not a big success in Test cricket, he was very successful playing for Bengal. He took 299 first class wickets from 85 matches. A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Chuni Goswami feels Guha didnt achieve what he could have because he wasnt very hard working. Guha and Goswami played together for nearly a decade and featured in two Ranji Trophy finals  against Bombay. He had a great style. His run-up, bowling action was superb. He could move the ball in the air and off the wicket and his pace was decent. But he was somewhat casual and averse to hard work. With his talent, Guha should have achieved more. Goswami recalled a three-day match against the West Indies in 1966 in Indore where the two of them represented a combined East Zone-Central Zone team. We beat them in that game. Myself and Guha accounted for 19 of the 20 wickets. I got 11 and Guha eight, Goswami said. Every player needs to put in long hours at the nets and its all the more essential for a pace bowler. This is where he missed the trick. He could have played many more Test matches had he paid more attention to this aspect. Gopal Bose, another former teammate of Guha, said the medium-pacer was one of those who would walk into any all-time Bengal XI. In fact, he would be an automatic choice, said the former batsman. His rhythm was fantastic. In seaming conditions, he was unplayable A terrific swing bowler. In the early Seventies, he played a major role in our win over a Hyderabad team boasting seven India players. It was mainly due to him that other teams found it difficult to score at will against us. Todays Bengal team would do anything to get a bowler like him, Bose noted.  (PTI)  Copyright

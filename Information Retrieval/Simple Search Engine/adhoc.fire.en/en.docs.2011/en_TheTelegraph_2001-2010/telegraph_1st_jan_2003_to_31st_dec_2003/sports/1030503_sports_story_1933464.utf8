The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dravid to spend three months in Scotland
New Delhi: Indian vice-captain Rahul Dravid will leave for Scotland by the end of this month for a three-month stint with the Scottish national team, which is trying for a berth in the 2007 World Cup. I am looking forward to this opportunity of playing in Scotland. It will help me stay in touch with the game through the off-season, without too much cricket, Dravid, who is getting married on Sunday, said. Dravid will play 11 games with the side, making their debut in Englands national league. If the Asia Cup is not held, India have no meets until the home series against New Zealand in October.

 Moin added to list of probables
Karachi: Former captain and wicketkeeper Moin Khan has been added to Pakistans probables for the one-day series against New Zealand later this month, officials said on Monday. Moin was added to the list of 22 probables for the series after the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Tauqir Zia, stepped in to defuse a row between coach Javed Miandad and chief selector Aamer Sohail. The dispute flared up after Sohail announced the pool of players last Friday without consulting the captain or coach. THE PROBABLES: Imran Farhat, Salman Butt, Saleem Elahi, Taufeeq Umar, Yasir Hameed, Inzamam-ul Haq, Yusuf Youhana, Asim Kamal, Misbah-ul Haq, Bilal Asad, Abdul Razzaq, Azhar Mahmood, Shoaib Malik, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami, Umer Gul, Shabbir Ahmed, Abdul Rauf, Mohammad Irshad, Fahad Masood, Kamran Akmal, Danish Kaneria, Moin Khan.

 No Ranji match in Siliguri
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Though Bengal won their only Ranji Trophy game last season in Siliguri, the CAB authorities have decided against allotting any match at the Kanchenjungha Stadium this time around. The CAB authorities said Bengal have only two home games this season, against Assam and Hyderabad in the league stage. We prefer to have those games held at the Eden Gardens itself, CAB secretary Bablu Kolay said on Thursday. However, a Deodhar Trophy match between East Zone and Central Zone will take place at Siliguri from January 15. Also, an under-25 match between Bengal and Sikkim will be held at the Kanchenjungha Stadium. Meanwhile, the East Zone leg of the national one-day meet will take place in Jamshedpur from January 3-10. The fixture was finalised in a meeting of the East Zone committee at the CAB on Thursday. The city will host the final leg from February 5, where the champions of all zones will participate.

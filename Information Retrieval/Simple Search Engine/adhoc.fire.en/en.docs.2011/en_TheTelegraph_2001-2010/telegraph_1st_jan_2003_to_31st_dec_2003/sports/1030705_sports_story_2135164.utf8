 Tide Of Fortune may strike again 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL  Prakash Bangalore: S. Ganapathys ward, Tide Of Fortune, who is in great shape, looks good for an encore when she takes on five rivals in the 1,200m H. B. Gundappa Gowda Memorial Cup on Saturday here. Although, the Diffident-Mary Bankers filly is giving chunks of weights all around, her sparkling form may help her partner B. Prakash beat Imperial Legend. The latter was a good second to Prevalence, also from Ganapathys yard.SELECTIONS2.30 pm: Auchterarder 1. Simple And Sweet 2. Alto 3.3 pm: Rivendell 1. Star Again 2.

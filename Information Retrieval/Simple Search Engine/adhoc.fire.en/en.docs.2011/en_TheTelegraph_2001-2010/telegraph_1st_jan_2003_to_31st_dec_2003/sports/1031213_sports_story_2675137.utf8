 Sri Lanka tighten grip
Kandy: Sri Lanka tightened their grip on the second Test against England on Friday, dismissing the tourists for 294 then extending their overall lead to 127. Sri Lanka were 39 for one in their second innings when bad light stopped play on the third day. Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan shared eight wickets as England, who started the day on 163 for four in reply to Sri Lankas 382, conceded a 88-run first innings deficit. Englands plight would have been worse as they slumped to 205 for seven before battling innings by Graham Thorpe (57) and Gareth Batty (38) frustrated Sri Lanka. Left-arm pacer Vaas started an England collapse in the morning as three wickets fell for 28 runs, before mopping up Englands tail with the new ball to finish with four for 77 from 24.2 overs. Muralidharan took two more wickets to finish with four for 60 from 40 overs. Thorpe provided the main resistance for the tourists, playing Muralidharan skilfully and working the ball into the gaps with characteristic industry, to top score with a four-hour innings lasting 198 balls. The left-hander was well supported by Batty, with whom he added 51 runs in 174 balls for the eighth wicket, halting Englands early morning slide.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

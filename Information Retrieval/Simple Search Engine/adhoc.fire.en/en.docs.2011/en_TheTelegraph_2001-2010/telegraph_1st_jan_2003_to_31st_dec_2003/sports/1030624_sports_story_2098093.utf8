The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag one-up 
London: It was one of those rare encounters between two Indians when Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag squared up in the middle representing different county teams in a National League match at Headingley on Sunday. And it was Sehwag, representing Leicestershire, who ended up on the winning side though Yuvraj also made merry with a quick-fire 50 for Yorkshire. Sehwag smashed a fine 80-ball 65, which included 11 hits to the fence. He added 126 runs with Australian Brad Hodge (104) for the second wicket as Leicestershire posted an imposing total of 251 for five in 45 overs. Sehwag got his 50 in 63 balls. Yuvraj, who disappointed with the ball conceding 54 runs in seven overs, made amends with the bat during Yorkshires run chase. He hit seven fours and a six in his 50. (PTI)  Copyright

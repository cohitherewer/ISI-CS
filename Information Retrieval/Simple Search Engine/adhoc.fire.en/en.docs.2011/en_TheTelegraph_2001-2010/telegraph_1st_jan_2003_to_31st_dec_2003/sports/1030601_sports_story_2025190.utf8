 Gray: Aussies living in fools paradise
 Gray is concerned about the future of world cricket Melbourne, May 31 (Reuters): International Cricket Council president Malcolm Gray said today he has told Australia they are living in a fools paradise and should be more concerned for the future of world cricket. Australia, the top-ranked Test nation, successfully defended the World Cup in March before winning Test and one-day series in the West Indies. They also won a world record 21 consecutive one-day Internationals. That has given me concern for some time, Gray said of Australias dominance. On many occasions I have put it to the Australian Cricket Board that they are living in a fools paradise, added Gray in an interview with The Australian newspaper. The team is the best in the world, theyre financially secure, their administration equal to the best in the world. It is very easy in Australia to have a rosy view of cricket and not realise the problems internationally. It is a very serious problem. One of the greatest challenges cricket has is to ensure that there is a greater evenness within the competition. The clash between Glenn McGrath and Ramnaresh Sarwan earlier this month had caused resentment even among their sporting public, he said. This was the first time the Australian public had taken such a strong opposition to the team, Gray added.  Copyright

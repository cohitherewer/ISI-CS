The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Michael running low on confidence
 GERMAN GRAND PRIX - World champion  expecting a tough home race Michael Schumacher  during the Game of Hearts, a celebrity match in Mannheim  on Wednesday. The match takes place prior to the German  GP and the profits are donated to UNESCO. (AFP)  Hockenheim: World champion  Michael Schumacher admitted on Thursday that he and his  Ferrari team are not confident of victory in this weekends  German Grand Prix.  Michael is determined to prove  his doubters wrong on home soil at Hockenheim on Sunday  after failing to shine in the British GP and seeing his  championship lead over Kimi Raikkonen reduced to seven points.  Michael finished fourth for Ferrari at Silverstone, losing  a vital point to McLaren-Mercedes Raikkonen, and had to  watch his teammate Rubens Barrichello lift the winners  trophy.  The five-time champion is determined  to win the German Grand Prix for his home fans this weekend  but admitted: Many people believe that Hockenheim will  not be suitable for the Ferrari. Last year I was very confident  about my chances in the race, which is not all the common  at Hockenheim, and it was one of the highlights of the season.  I cant wait to return to Germany,  but this year the race definitely looks a much tougher prospect  than last season and everyone at Ferrari is aware of that.  It is not an impossible task and, recently, we have made  significant progress, so we feel well prepared. But we can  expect a very tough race.  Michael and Ferrari can expect  Williams-BMW  and their two drivers Ralf Schumacher and  Juan Pablo Montoya  to fight hard for victory. The Williams  pair have collected 73 points from a possible 90 in the  last five races, with Montoya winning in Monaco, and Ralf  Schumacher taking the European and French Grand Prix.  But another strong performance  from Williams, ironically, could be exactly what Michael  needs to boost his championship chances. McLaren, with their  new car now delayed by teething problems and a current testing  ban for at least the next three races, have seen Raikkonens  hopes of taking the title diminishing.  Realistically, he needs Michael  to fail to finish in the points in his home race  which  he has only done three times in 10 appearances here  if  he is to strengthen his championship chances with just five  races to go. While Michael looks over his shoulder at Raikkonen,  however, his Ferrari team have to keep an eye on Williams,  who are just 10 points behind in the race for the constructors  championship. The junior Schumacher Ralf, fourth  in the drivers standings, has counted out his hopes of  fighting his brother for the championship this year but  is concentrating on helping Williams pip Ferrari to the  constructors title. The drivers championship is far from  my thoughts, said Schumacher. Hockenheim is my home Grand  Prix so I am concentrating on that. And hopefully I can  secure another win.  Further down the grid, Jaguar  will be boosted in their hopes of overtaking BAR-Honda for  fifth place in the table by the arrival of Justin Wilson  from Minardi. The British driver, who made his debut at  the start of the season, has replaced Brazilian Antonio  Pizzonia for the remainder of this season.  But Jaguar managing director David  Pitchforth is not expecting Wilson to immediately match  teammate Mark Webber and said: Hockenheim will be like  winter testing for Justin and Hungary is likely to be more  of the same. Monza is really going to be his first real  race because a new team, a new car and new tracks are a  difficult combination to balance. But Justin has a lot of  experience behind him and we can only ask him to do his  best.  (AFP) Copyright

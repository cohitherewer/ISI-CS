The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shock exit for Dortmund 
London: Former Champions League winner Borussia Dortmund suffered its worst-ever European loss on Thursday when it was dumped out of the Uefa Cup in a 4-0 loss at French club Sochaux. The German heavyweight lost 6-2 on aggregate and joined former Uefa Cup champions Schalke 04 and Feyenoord in shock exits. Dortmund, who lost the Uefa Cup final to Feyenoord two years ago, never recovered from the fifth minute expulsion of Salvatore Gambino. Schalke lost 1-3 on penalties at Brondby, while Feyenoord failed to overcome its poor first-leg performance at provincial Czech club FK Teplice to lose 1-3 on aggregate. In another shock result, Polands Dyskobolia Grodzisk Groclin ousted a Manchester City side led by former England manager Kevin Keegan on the away goals rule. Teams comfortably advancing to the third round were Italys Parma, which beat Austria Salzburg 5-0 for a 9-0 aggregate win, and Turkeys Gaziantepspor, which won 3-1 at ten-man Lens to advance 6-1 overall. Antonio Cassano was again the hero for Roma, scoring a late equaliser in a 1-1 tie at Hadjuk Split to send the Italians into the third round on a 2-1 aggregate. Cassano scored the winner in the 1-0 first-leg win. Liverpool beat Steaua Bucharest 1-0 off a Harry Kewell strike for a 2-1 aggregate win, and Newcastle had a 1-0 win over Basel for a 4-2 overall win. Barcelona had Luis Enrique sent off in the 25th minute, but still beat Greek side Panionios 2-0. Javier Saviola and Luis Garcia scored at the Nou camp to give Barcelona a 5-0 aggregate win. Norways Valerenga beat Wisla Krakow 4-3 on penalties in Poland after two 0-0 draws. Sochaux kept its 30-match unbeaten streak at the Auguste-Bonal stadium alive against Dortmund, which won the European Cup in 1997. Pierre-Alain Frau scored from a sixth minute penalty after Gambino was sent off for pulling down Sochaux striker Santos in the penalty area. Francileudo Santos added the second in the 64th minute, Wilson Oruma scored the third in the 76th and Jeremy Mathieu finished the rout in the 89th minute. In Poland, Groclin had better chances in the 0-0 draw. Sebastian Milas goal in the 1-1 first leg draw in Manchester City pushed the club through on goal difference.  (AP)  Copyright

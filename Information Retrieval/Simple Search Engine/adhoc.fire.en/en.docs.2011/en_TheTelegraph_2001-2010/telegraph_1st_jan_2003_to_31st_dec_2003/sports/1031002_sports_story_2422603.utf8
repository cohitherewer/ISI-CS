The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Douglas has stress fracture
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Douglas will be out for at least 20 days Calcutta: All is not well with East Bengal. The red-and-gold brigade, who boasted of a super fit line-up at the beginning of the season, now has an ever-growing casualty list. Their Brazilian recruit, Douglas da Silva has suffered a stress fracture in his shin bone and will not be available for practise for at least 20 days. In fact, the Brazilian could even find himself out of the Super League play-off final, which is likely to take place in the first week of November. He had an injury on his shin bone for a long time, but carried on for the sake of the team, a senior East Bengal official said. The scan on his injury was done after the IFA Shield final and the report came on Tuesday. It is understood that a synthetic device has been fitted around his leg and he has been advised complete rest. Even after the device is removed, the only exercise he can do for some time is swimming. It is feared that if the Brazilian is rushed for the play-off final, he may even become doubtful for the National League. To add to East Bengals woes, Sasthi Duley has suffered a quadricep tear and he too has been advised rest for a minimum of 15 days. Lets see how he recovers, then well decide on his participation in the play-off final, he added. According to the club brass, Debjit Ghosh, Dipak Mondal and Alvito DCunha have not yet fully recovered from their injuries, but unfortunately they had to leave for Bangalore on Wednesday for the national camp.

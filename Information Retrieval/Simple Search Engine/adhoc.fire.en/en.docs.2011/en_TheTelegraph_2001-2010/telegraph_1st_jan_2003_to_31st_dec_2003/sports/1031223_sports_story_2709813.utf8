The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pakistan bank on bowlers
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta: Pakistans bowling  gives them an edge over rivals in the on-going tri-series,  at least against Sri Lanka A, feels coach Naveed Anjum.  Sri Lanka A and Pakistan A meet in the second match of the  competition on Tuesday. We are on par with the other teams in batting and fielding, but bowling gives us an advantage. Its a combination of pace and spin and I think we are rather well off in this department, Anjum told The Telegraph on Monday. Despite the absence of Mohammed Irshad, likely to miss the first two matches with a groin injury, Anjum thinks the likes of Abdul Rauf and left-armer Mohammed Khaleel make the Pakistan attack formidable. We also have a very talented leg-spinner in Mansoor Amjad. Besides, batsmen Mohammed Hafeez and Shahid Afridi are capable of bowling ten overs each, said the coach. The coach refused to comment on the chances of fielding former PCB chief Tauqir Zias son Junaid (a fast bowler) on Tuesday. It depends on what combination we will try out and that will be taken later. He said batting first will be Pakistan As ploy, even though he admitted the ball does a bit at the Eden early in the morning.  Copyright

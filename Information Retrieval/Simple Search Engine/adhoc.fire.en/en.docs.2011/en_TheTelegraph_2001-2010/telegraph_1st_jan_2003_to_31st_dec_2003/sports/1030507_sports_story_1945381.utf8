 Jaffer, Shetty steady Mumbai
- TN drop four catches after taking 11-run first innings lead Wasim Jaffer drives during his 98 at the Wankhede Tuesday. Jaffer and Nishit Shetty (100) put on 188 runs for the second wicket. (PTI) Mumbai: Wasim Jaffer (98) and Nishit Shetty (100) were involved in a 188-run second wicket partnership that helped hosts Mumbai finish the third day at 228 for four in their second innings against Tamil Nadu in the Ranji Trophy final at the Wankhede Stadium Tuesday.Earlier, Mumbai seamers Ajit Agarkar (four for 57) and skipper Paras Mhambrey (two for 36) restricted the visitors first innings lead to just 11 runs.Resuming at 223 for four, Tamil Nadu batsmen found the going pretty tough against some accurate bowling with the second new ball claimed by Mhambrey at the fag end of the second day. They struggled for 28.3 overs before being all out for 271.Mumbai had made 260 in their first innings. After an indifferent show on Day I, the Tamil Nadu fielding again left a lot to be desired. As of now, they have dropped four catches in the Mumbai second innings after flooring three in the first.Shetty, dropped thrice, benefited the most. Just after lunch, he was dropped by J. Gokhulakrishnan off Balaji on four. Then wicketkeeper Raaju failed to latch on to a thick nick off skipper S. Suresh on 74 and lastly it was M.R. Srinivas turn to drop the left-hander on 91. Srinivas, however, made amends, striking thrice towards the end of the day, sending back Jaffer, Shetty and Vinayak Samant (6) in quick succession.Jaffer and Shetty came together after Mumbai lost Vinayak Mane for two in the seventh over. Mane, who had scored 13 in the first innings, was trapped leg-before by L. Balaji trying to drive an over-pitched delivery.Jaffer and Shetty then batted for more than 45 overs together to string in a fine partnership. The 30-year-old Shetty went for his shots, playing a few lofted drives on either side of the wicket. Jaffer, on the other hand, played some delectable flicks and attractive cover drives against both Balaji and Srinivas.Shetty, who reached his hundred with an uppish drive, was out the very next ball when he holed out to Suresh in the point region. His innings included 13 fours and a six.Jaffer, who looked destined for a century, fell leg-before in Srinivas next over. He hit 15 boundaries during his 253-minute stay at the crease.Srinivas also sent back night watchman Samant, caught by S. Badrinath at mid-wicket. Samants dismissal brought the curtains down on the days proceedings, with Amol Muzumdar (4) batting at the other end. (PTI)  Copyright

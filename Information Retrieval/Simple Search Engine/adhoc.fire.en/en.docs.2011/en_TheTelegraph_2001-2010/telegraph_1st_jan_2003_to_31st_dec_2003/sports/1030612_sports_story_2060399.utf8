 NZ against tie in Karachi
Karachi: New Zealand do not want to play in Karachi during their trip of Pakistan later this year after witnessing a bomb blast on their last visit to the city. New Zealand have made a request to this effect. The itinerary is yet to be given final shape, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Rameez Raja said Wednesday. We can understand the reasons for New Zealands request, Rameez said. But at the same time Bangladesh and South Africa have confirmed they will be playing at Karachi this season. Fleming for Yorkshire New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming and left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori have signed contracts to play County cricket this summer, say reports from Christchurch Fleming has signed an 11-week deal with Yorkshire and Vettori inked a five-week contract with Nottinghamshire, as both agreements were endorsed by New Zealand Cricket (NZC).

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassi vows to have another shot at Big W
London: Andre Agassi says he will be back to play at Wimbledon next year, once again looking for a second title at the age of 34. The world No. 1, pounded out of the fourth round of this years tournament by big-serving Australian Mark Philippoussis Monday, had no hesitation when asked about his future plans. Why shouldnt I be back. Im a tennis player. My plan is to be back next year, Agassi said. The American, who won Wimbledon in 1992, said victories grew sweeter with age and defeats more disappointing. They get more disappointing but it doesnt last as long, Agassi said. Its disappointing because its another year lost at Wimbledon, said Agassi, who chose not to play the grasscourt Grand Slam for three years from 1988. As you get older you are aware of how short-term all those opportunities are... But you go home to your boy, you go home to your life... I try to keep it in perspective. Agassi is married to Steffi Graf, has an 18-month-old son and the couple is expecting a second child later this year. He said only a few points on Monday separated himself and Philippoussis, who banged down 46 aces. So little can decide each set. There were a lot of moments when either one of us could have won... he ended up being the one to take the opportunities in the end.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

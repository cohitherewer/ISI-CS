		 Friday, January 03, 2003 				 Gooch takes up cudgels for Steve
				 	 GOOCH: Steve would know when to retire																								Sydney: Steve Waugh is playing well enough to continue playing Test cricket, former England captain Graham Gooch said here on Thursday.																								Gooch, who was 41 when he retired from first-class cricket, said the 37-year-old Steve would know when it was time to retire. And while the fifth Ashes Test, which got underway at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday, may be Steves last, Gooch said the 156-Test veteran had the form to continue playing.																								I think he is still playing well enough, I dont think theres any doubt about that, Gooch told Australian Associated Press. If you want anyone to go out and bat for your life down at number five or six as the Test match progresses, hes the man to do that job.																								Gooch said while the best time to introduce new players was when a team was playing well, it should not be done at the expense of an older player who was still performing.																								If youre performing well enough to stay in the team, then age shouldnt be a consideration, he said. If it becomes a bit of a toss up between the younger guy and the older guy because of form and whatever, then youre always going to go for the younger guy, arent you because hes got more of a future.																								While Steve says he doesnt know whether to retire or play on, Gooch believed he would recognise when to pull up the stumps. I think its up to the individual, he knows how hes playing, Gooch said.																								Steve equalled Allan Borders record of maximum (156) Test appearances when he led his team into the field in the fifth Ashes Test Thursday. He has already become the most successful Australian Test captain of all time with 33 wins in 44 Tests.																								Border held the earlier Australian record of 32 wins in 95 matches. West Indies great Clive Lloyd holds the world record of most Test wins as captain  36 in 74.  (AFP)

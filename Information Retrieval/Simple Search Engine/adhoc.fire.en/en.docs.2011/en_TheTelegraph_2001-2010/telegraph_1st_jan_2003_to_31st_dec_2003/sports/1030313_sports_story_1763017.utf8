The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian pace attack as potent as any
 - New Zealand need better balance  in bowling to restrict Tendulkar amp; Co. BY GREG CHAPPELL NEHRA: Looks good  to take over baton from Srinath  The confidence and team spirit  evident in the Indian team has grown out of the belief that  they can fight fire with fire under any conditions. No longer  do they require pitches suitable for spinners to upset top  teams on foreign soil. Possibly for the first time in their  history, India have a pace attack that can match any going  around for pace and versatility. I believe the combination of batting  and bowling depth, allied with new-found agility in the  field and the spirit, will carry India to victory over New  Zealand on Friday. New Zealand will be shattered  by their loss to Australia. Having reduced the champions  to 84 for seven after asking them to bat first on a slow  wicket containing moisture, New Zealand should have won. The lack of a potent pace partner  to help Shane Bond finish the lower-order caused the downfall  of Stephen Fleming and his men. Fleming made all the right  moves. He had to bowl Bond out because he had the chance  to finish off the Australians. Likewise, he had to keep  Daniel Vettori going at the other end as he was helping  Bond build the pressure. There was little else he could  have done. This is the worrying thing for  New Zealand for the match with India. It is a must-win game  for them and the pressure will be immense. Apart from Bond and Vettori, the  rest of the attack lacked control and ideas. Andre Adams  has bowled well under similar conditions, but he made little  impact here apart from a doodle-bug that gave Bichel a solid  blow to the head. Chris Harris was his usual frugal  self. The slow wicket is his preferred surface so he must  have felt at home, but he could not make a breakthrough  for his captain. Fleming shuffled the deck chairs  but to no avail. He would like a better balance in his attack  against India or his team could be chasing a much larger  total in Centurion Friday. ZAHEER: Hits deck  hard, bowls probing line and length In many ways, Bonds good form  worked against the New Zealand captain on this occasion.  He will need to get wickets from both ends if he is to stop  the rampant Tendulkar amp; Co. On the other hand, Sourav Ganguly  is enjoying a rare embarrassment of riches. His pace attack  is really starting to come together. India have never had  such a potent three-pronged pace attack before.  Jawagal Srinath is the elder statesman  who is confirming what we have recognised for quite some  time. He is an excellent bowler and combines good pace with  intelligent strategy. Ganguly will be thankful to have  him back because he is the ingredient that has been missing  in recent times. No doubt the captain will hope that this  series may inspire the good-natured paceman to extend his  career. Srinath has never had such support  in the pace bowling ranks before. Zaheer Khan and Ashish  Nehra are growing in stature every day. The two left-handers  have combined well with Srinath, offering variation to his  incisive away-swing to the right-handed batsmen. Khan is  not as quick as Nehra, but he does hit the bat hard and  bowls a probing line and length as well. This variation  in the new ball attack has worked well for India. Nehra is the rising star. He is  set to take over from Srinath as the leader of the attack  for the next generation, much like Srinath took over from  the redoubtable Kapil Dev.  The baton is in good hands. The  young man has showed he has pace and the ability to swing  the ball back into the right-handed batsman. This is a proven  winning formula. History will show that bowlers  with this one-two combination can fight in the heavyweight  division and take their share of the spoils. I will watch  Nehras development with interest. There is no doubt that Tendulkar  and the Indian batting line-up has a big part to play in  the remainder of the World Cup. They will need to set targets  and chase targets against some quality opposition, but it  will be their bowling attack that will be responsible if  India are to take the Cup away from the Australians.

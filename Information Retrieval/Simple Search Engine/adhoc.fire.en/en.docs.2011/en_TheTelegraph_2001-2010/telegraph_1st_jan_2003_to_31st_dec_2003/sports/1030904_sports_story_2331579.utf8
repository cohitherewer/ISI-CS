The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bashar defies Pak again
 Umar Gul, who scalped three wickets, in Multan on Wednesday. (AFP) Multan: Bangladesh, inspired again by in-form Habibul Bashar, frustrated Pakistan on the first day of the third and final Test on Wednesday, reaching 248 for six at stumps. Bashar made 72, sharing a 74-run partnership with Javed Omar (38). Rajin Saleh (49) and Khaled Mashud (29 batting) chipped in with 62-run stand for the sixth wicket too. Bangladesh are playing for pride as Pakistan seek a clean sweep after winning the first two Tests in Karachi and Peshawar. Bangladesh opted for first strike and made a respectable start. Bashar was outstanding and continued his purple patch of the first two Tests when he hit 71, 108, 97 and 28. His score of 72 here was his 15th Test half-century and his third in the series, giving him an excellent record of a century and six half-centuries in six Tests against Pakistan. Bashar overcame the quick losses of Omar and Mohammad Ashraful, trapped leg-before by Saqlain Mushtaq. But he fell to a loose shot, edging 17-year-old debutant paceman Yasir Ali to Rashid Latif. Umar Gul finished the day with figures of three for 71.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

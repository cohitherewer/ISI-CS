 Time to adopt a path of honour
 Greig believes golf can be a good example to emulate Bangalore: Former England captain Tony Greig believes the game desperately needs cricketers who can adopt the path of honour and be honest to themselves as well as the sport. I think there comes a time in the evolution of the game where you need to change the directions a little bit. I think that time is now. If cricket wanted to look at anything as an example, golf is good example... Its the honour aspect, he said here Sunday. On a visit to the city to take part in a golf tournament, the ace commentator said golf is a game of honour. If one pushes the ball (in golf), one gets rubbed off (the tournament), he pointed out. Stressing that cricket could take a cue from golf, he said cricketers should be honest enough and walk off if they feel they are out. Whats wrong in walking (back to the pavilion)? If you are out, you are out... Why make it harder for the umpire... There lies an opportunity for the game and take a cue from golf, he said. Greig, who first came to India in 1968, said he has been enjoying his visits since then and added I always think India is the headquarters of cricket. Slowly but surely, India is becoming headquarters in more than the enthusiastic sense... In terms of the finances of the game as well. I suppose the whole thing is based on the love that Indians have for this game, he said. While I have never lived in the shoes of Sachin Tendulkar, the Master Blaster continues to attract adulation in places like Australia and England, Greig said. On the upcoming series between India and New Zealand, he said Sourav Ganguly and his men are hard to beat at home. Tendulkar, Ganguly, V. V. S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid are very, very good batsmen.

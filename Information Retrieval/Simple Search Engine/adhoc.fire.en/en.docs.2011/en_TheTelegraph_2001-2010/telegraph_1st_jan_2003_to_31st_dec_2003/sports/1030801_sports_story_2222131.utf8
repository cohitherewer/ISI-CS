 Glenn McGrath pulls out with ankle injury
 Third lay-off for McGrath this year Cairns: Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath has pulled out of the one-day series against Bangladesh starting this week because of an ankle injury which may require surgery. Im naturally disappointed at having to pull out of the series, McGrath said in a statement on Thursday. However, knowing we have a few months ahead of us that are clear of cricket commitments, I can use that period to get on top of the injury. It is an injury that I have managed for most of my international career, but during the recent Test in Cairns it just seemed to flare up. Its probably the best I have bowled since the World Cup, so its disappointing that this has happened now. Western Australias Brad Williams, who has won six one-day International caps, would replace McGrath in the squad. McGrath took five for 124 as Australia claimed innings victories in both matches of the Test series against Bangladesh this month. The 33-year-old took just one wicket in the second Test which ended on Monday in Cairns in north Queensland. Australias second-leading wicket-taker behind leg-spinner Shane Warne, McGrath is returning to Sydney to seek medical advice on possible surgery, which could leave him on the sidelines for up to five weeks. Its his left ankle and the pain has increased over the last few days, team physiotherapist Errol Alcott told newsmen. (Reuters)  Copyright

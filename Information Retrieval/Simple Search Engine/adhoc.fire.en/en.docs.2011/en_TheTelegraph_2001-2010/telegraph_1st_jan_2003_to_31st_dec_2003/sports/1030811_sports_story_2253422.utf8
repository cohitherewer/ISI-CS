 Pillay: Stress on defence in dying minutes
New Delhi: Indian captain Dhanraj Pillay said on Sunday that his team will put emphasis on defence in the dying minutes of games to deny rivals the opportunity to score late in the Champions Trophy which gets underway in Amstelveen on Friday. Conceding goals in the dying minutes is a matter of concern. Thats why we have decided to cut down on our attacks and put stress on defence in the last five or seven minutes of a match, Pillay said just before the squads departure for the 6-nation meet. Pillay said the 17-day camp in Lucknow under energy-sapping conditions helped the team remove its shortcomings and emerge stronger. We practised hard in the camp almost four hours every day in the morning and evening in hot and humid conditions. We will face cold conditions in Holland but we are hopeful of getting acclimatised before the start of the tournament as we are going five days early. India begin their campaign with a match against the Dutchmen on Saturday.  (PTI)  Copyright

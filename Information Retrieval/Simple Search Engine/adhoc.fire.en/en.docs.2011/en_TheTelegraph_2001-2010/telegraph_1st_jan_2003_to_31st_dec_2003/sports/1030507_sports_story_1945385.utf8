 Aussies to honour former players 
Melbourne: Australias 199 living Test cricketers will be honoured at a reunion dinner in Sydney in July, ACB chief executive James Sutherland said on Tuesday. Each player will receive a commemorative baggy green cap and the older players will be issued with their own official Test numbers. Players began wearing their official numbers on shirts and caps in the 1990s. The July 11 function is a joint initiative of the ACB and the Australian Cricketers Association to reunite Australias Test players. The 385 players who have worn the baggy green cap have collectively contributed to a sporting tradition that in turn has helped develop our distinctive Australian national culture, Sutherland said in a statement. When selected to represent Australia for the first time, players receive a baggy green cap and an allocated Test cap number which becomes part of their identity. In recent times, there has been strong interest in the number which now appears on each players shirt. The most-recently capped and 385th Australia Test player was Queensland batsman Martin Love against England in the 2002-03 home Ashes series. Steve most successful Meanwhile, Steve Waugh became the most successful captain in Test history along with Clive Lloyd of West Indies following Australias nine-wicket triumph in Bridgetown Monday. This was Waughs 36th Test win as captain in 48 outings, the success rate being a staggering 75 per cent. However, three other Australians feature in the list of top 10. While Allan Border is in third spot with 32 Test wins, Mark Taylor is sixth in the list with 26 under his belt from 50. Greg Chappell, too, is right up there in the seventh spot, with 21 wins from 48 outings.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

(Reuters)																								Cape Town: South Africa beat Pakistan in the second Test on Sunday to seal the two-match series and become the first side to displace Australia at the top of the World Test Championship.																								Pakistan, resuming on 184 for five after following on 368 runs behind, were dismissed for 226 on the fourth morning to lose by an innings and 142 runs.																								They had earlier lost the first Test by 10 wickets.																								Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini finished with four for 33 on Sunday. It was clinical, South Africa skipper Shaun Pollock said. To win by these margins showed how well we played.																								South Africa, whose victory gave them a perfect boost before hosting next months World Cup, scored a massive 620 for seven at Newlands, setting a string of records along the way.																								Openers Herschelle Gibbs and Graeme Smith put on a record 368 for the first wicket, with Gibbs scoring a career best 228 and Smith 151. 																								Gibbs innings was the second fastest Test double century in Tests. Gibbs said: It was a really good wicket and I have to thank the groundsman for such a good strip as well as my batting partner  I couldnt have done it without him.																								Pakistan skipper Waqar Younis said: We didnt bat well at all throughout the series. We now have a fair idea about the wickets here, though. We must gather ourselves and return for the World Cup with a positive frame of mind.																								Indian Match Referee Gundappa Viswanath fined all the Pakistan players their entire match fees for slow over-rate. The players went home empty-handed after taking 70 minutes longer than allowed on Day I on Thursday and infringing again on Day II. 																								Ntini was named Man of the Series with 13 wickets.																								Australia have led the Test Championship since it was inaugurated in May 2001 but have yet to play the two weakest sides, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.																								Australia captain Steve Waugh, asked about losing the trophy for the first time after his side had beaten the South Africans in five of their last six Tests, said last month: Everyone knows who the number one side is, so I dont really see that as a big issue. 																								Hayward summoned																								South African fast bowler Mornantau Hayward will be summoned to a disciplinary hearing after signing a two-year contract with English county Worcestershire which will make him unavailable for South Africas tour of England this year.																								UCB chief executive Gerald Majola said Hayward was in breach of his UCB contract in finalising a deal without consulting the board. He would be called to a disciplinary meeting.																								Hayward said he signed the contract in September. I didnt know where I was standing with the UCB. Whether Ill be in the Test team or not was also not known, he said. 																								The first year of the contract has a no-escape clause which means the player cannot be released for international matches. 																								South Africa play five Tests in England from July to September.  (REUTERS)

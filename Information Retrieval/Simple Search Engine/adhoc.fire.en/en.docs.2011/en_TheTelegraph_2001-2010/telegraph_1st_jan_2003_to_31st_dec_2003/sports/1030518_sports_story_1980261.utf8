The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Confusion over Srinath continues
London, May 17 (PTI): Jawagal Srinath has decided to retire from first-class cricket, a leading British newspaper reported Saturday but there was no confirmation from the player. [The Telegraph contacted BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya in Calcutta and chairman of selection committee Brijesh Patel in Bangalore, but none had been informed of any such decision by the fast bowler.] Srinath, who is in UK as a bowling coach-cum player for English county side Durham, could not be contacted for confirmation of the report in The Daily Telegraph which gave no source for it. Srinath, who had a wonderful World Cup in South Africa in February-March returning a haul of 16 wickets at 23.06, may continue to play limited-overs cricket after a break, the paper said. The medium pacer has had a distinguished international career which fetched him 236 wickets in 67 Tests, second only to Kapil Dev among Indians.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I live and die on every ball: Whatmore
While the Aravinda of old cant return, he has shown glimpses of his genius in this World Cup  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI WHATMORE: Theres always talent to replace anyone Johannesburg: Back in 1996, Dav Whatmores planning and the brilliant on-field execution by Arjuna Ranatunga gave Sri Lanka the World Cup  and a new identity. Whatmore, who has worn Australian colours in the big league, didnt have a role in Sri Lankas 1999 campaign but is in the thick of action in World Cup 2003.Whatmore likes keeping a low profile and isnt particularly fond of one-to-one intervi- ews. However, he made an exception for The Telegraph Sunday evening and spoke for around half-an-hour at the team hotel (Intercontinental Sandton Sun  amp; Towers).The following are excerptsOn whether the game has changed from the 1996 World Cup till nowCricket is evolving all the time... The teams have become more professional, with more support staff and such like... The preparation too has got better. Indeed, the quality of planning has improved at a faster rate than other areas... Also, the skill-level of players has risen a few notches.On how different has his own planning been (the present World Cup vis-a-vis 1996)As a lead-up, Ive been with the team a lot longer than 1996. Then, I had been around for less than a year... This time, Ive had more opportunity to try and hit the right combination  mind you, without having a role in the selection. That we toured South Africa at the start of the season has helped. On that tour being disastrousThats because any team from the sub-continent requires time to adjust to conditions which, obviously, are very different. Its never an easy time, its always frustrating... Its been different in the World Cup, as weve played a range of countries (not just South Africa) who also required time to adjust. Weve had the advantage of having toured the country not too long ago. On whether he has himself changed as coach(Laughs) The principles havent... The top principle, of course, is working on individuals to get better... I look at improvement rather than the end-result... The planning, though, is better. Instead of leaving things for the last minute, at the team meeting, we begin the chipping-away process a few days earlier. In the modern era, its important to be flexible. On the present team vis-a-vis the World Cup-winning one in 1996Were definitely a better fielding side now but, as a team, 1996 was better... It was more experienced and, frankly, very hard to beat. We proved it.On his own emotions in his second World Cup as coachGetting to the next stage (the semi-finals) will please me... At times, Im a bit too emotional... I live and die on every ball... Perhaps, I get very angry on the spur of the moment  but that doesnt last too long. You could say Im desperate for the team to do well. On, over the years, what has he learnt as coachThat a coach will be much better off if he is the master of his own destiny... In soccer, for instance, the coach (or manager) is the man. Not so in cricket, where he may not even have a say in selection. Quite often, the coach doesnt get the players he wants, doesnt have a role in the building-up process... Should the coach have a vote at selection meetings? Given my situation, its a must. On whether he agrees with John Buchanan that the powers-that-be dont seem to think a coach has a contribution in the betterment of the sport(Grins) Absolutely. I think we should have a coaches body at the international level... We do need a platform from where we can be heard and the administrators will benefit if they seek our inputs as well. Surely, we can offer a different perspective on how cricket should move forward. On Sri Lankas run in this World CupBut for that Kenya game (in Nairobi), Im extremely satisfied... We shouldnt have tripped at that hurdle and complacency ought not to have taken root. On that slow track, chasing 211, we should have been comfortably home. It wasnt nice losing, but the Kenyans enthusiasm stood out. In fact, their body-language against India too was good (in Cape Town).On whether he felt sorry for South AfricaIts never good for any team to be ousted via a tie... I was happy we wouldnt have to face South Africa in a later stage but, deep inside, one did feel bad... Im human, after all... But, if I may add, South Africa were lucky to have forced a tie and would have lost had the match gone its normal course. On whether he agrees the toss makes all the difference in Durban (in a day-night game)Well, statistics show its fifty-fifty... Seven ODIs have been won batting first, seven batting second... I dont think its as big an issue as was made out. Conditions did change dramatically, during the India-England match but, clearly, that was an exceptional night. It will be interesting to learn from which side the wind blew...On having played a big role in Aravinda de Silvas recall last yearI got involved because I felt he had a contribution to make... While the Aravinda of old cant return, he has shown glimpses of his genius in this World Cup. He can pick the gaps, can be brought on in the first 15 overs and has a wealth of experience and knowledge. .. He has been preparing to bow out on a high.On whether Sri Lanka could soon have to do without some of the most experienced playersAre you suggesting some are over the hill? No, Im not worried. Sanath Jayasuriya has a few years, Chaminda Vaas has never been fitter... Still, theres always talent to replace whoever... While experience has its place, a sprinkling of youngsters is needed. After all, if you have the same team marching at the spot all the time, you wont get very far.On what makes Muttiah Muralidharan tickHis drive for success... At times, that drive leaves him injured... Yet, he wont change... One can go on and on talking about Murali but, to keep it short, its his drive and hunger that has taken him to where he has reached. On whether theres a formula for successThere is, yes... Youve got to have talent, youve got to have character  the player must have fibre in his body  and youve got to have a minimum level of fitness. Put all that together and you should have a success story on your hands.On whether he will seek an extension after MayLook, it wouldnt be proper to discuss that in print.On whether his functioning has been affected by the frequent changes in the Sri Lankan boardContinuity is always better. Beyond that, its difficult for me to comment... Whatever the job, you must give the individuals a decent time to get on with it. Finally, on whether coaches have a shelf life(Laughs again) Ive only known two types: Coaches who have been sacked and the ones  Copyright

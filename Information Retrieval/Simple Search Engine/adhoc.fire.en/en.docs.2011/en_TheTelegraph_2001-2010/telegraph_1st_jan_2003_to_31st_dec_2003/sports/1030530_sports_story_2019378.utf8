The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Becks request to fans
London: David Beckham is set to make a televised appeal to disruptive fans in a bid to get Englands soccer image and reputation back on track. England play Serbia and Montenegro next week and Beckham, following the ugly scenes which marred their last international match against Turkey last month, will appear on BBC1, ITV and SKY before next Tuesdays friendly. The Turkey game, an Euro 2004 qualifier at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland, witnessed a number of pitch invasions and Beckham is concerned about consequences of similar events. It shouldnt happen. If it does again we will be thrown out of Euro 2004, Beckham told The Sun Thursday, adding the England players themselves also had a role to play. We have to be careful about our celebrations. I dont believe the players were responsible but we have to cut it down. He added: We have to celebrate in the middle of the pitch instead of by the corner flag. We want to stay in the competition. England could face heavy sanctions if scenes similar to the Turkey match are repeated. FA spokesman Adrian Bevington believes Beckhams message will help convince fans to think twice.

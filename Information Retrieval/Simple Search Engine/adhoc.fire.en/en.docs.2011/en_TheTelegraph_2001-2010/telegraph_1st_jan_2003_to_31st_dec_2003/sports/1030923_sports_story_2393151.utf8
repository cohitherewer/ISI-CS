 FA to probe Old Trafford fiasco
London: The Football Association (FA) officials confirmed on Monday they were launching an investigation into Sundays controversial Premier League clash between Manchester United and Arsenal at Old Trafford. Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira was red-carded ten minutes before the end after retaliating against United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy. His expulsion created a heated atmosphere which saw Van Nistelrooy surrounded by several Arsenal players after the goalless draw. Vieiras exit led to a post-match war of words with Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger labelling Van Nistelrooy a cheat, a claim which incensed United manager Alex Ferguson. In its statement the FA confirmed it had received referee Steve Bennetts report. But, in an unusual move, it said that as well as reviewing standard video tapes of the game it had also requested further videos of the various incidents from different camera angles.

 Pollock shuns a Cronje scale 
Bloemfontein: Captain Shaun Pollock dismissed reports of a split in the South African World Cup squad Thursday and told his critics not to compare him to late skipper Hansie Cronje. Whenever the Hansie Cronje affair raises its head, a lot of sentiment goes around, said Pollock.Ive moved past it. I have to focus on moving forward. Im not trying to be a Cronje or a Kepler Wessels or a Clive Rice. Pollock said he was not concerned by recent comments by opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs and veteran paceman Allan Donald who both had praised Cronje and lamented the absence of what they claimed was his tactical ability. I suppose comments like those dont help the situation, Pollock said. They dont mean any harm but it did do a bit of harm on the set-up. As for a split though, theres nothing like that. Ponting pot-shot Meanwhile, Australian captain Ricky Ponting took a pot-shot at Pollock, suggesting unimaginative captaincy had contributed to the home nations poor World Cup performance. They are very set in their ways and plans. The South Africans have a very regimented way and style of playing, Ponting said. Ponting said Pollock captained the side exactly the same way every game  bringing himself on in the same over in most games.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

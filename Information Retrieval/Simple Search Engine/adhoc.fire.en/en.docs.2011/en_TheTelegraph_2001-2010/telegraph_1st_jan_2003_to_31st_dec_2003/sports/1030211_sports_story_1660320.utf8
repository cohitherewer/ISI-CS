 Namibia buried under Wisharts 172
- Zimbabwe begin with 86-run victory in rain-hit tie Craig Wishart acknowledges cheers after an undefeated 172 against Namibia on Monday. (Reuters) Harare: Opener Craig Wishart hit a commanding, unbeaten 172 to set up Zimbabwes 86-run victory over Namibia in a rain-curtailed World Cup Group A match on Monday.Although the match started on time after months of controversy about the six World Cup games scheduled to take place in strife-torn Zimbabwe, rain halted play for the second time at 1410 GMT and, with no chance of a resumption, the game was abandoned.Facing a revised victory target of 325 in 46 overs, Namibia slipped from a flying start to 104 for five when rain intervened after 25.1 overs, well behind on the Duckworth/Lewis scoring method for interrupted matches.
	 Zimbabwe, batting first, piled up an imposing 340 for two in their 50 overs.Opener Wishart (172 n.o.) narrowly missed out on the highest individual World Cup score while Grant Flower finished unbeaten on 78.Wisharts 172 was the highest total by a Zimbabwe batsman in one-day Internationals but fell short of Gary Kirstens 188 not out for South Africa against the United Arab Emirates in the 1996 World Cup.Wishart, who struck three sixes and 18 fours in 149 balls, shared an opening stand of 107 with Mark Vermeulen, who made 39 before falling to the left-arm spin of 43-year old Lennie Louw, the oldest player of the meet.Andy Flower, who issued a hard-hitting statement with team mate Henry Olonga before the start of the match criticising Zimbabwes record on human rights and democracy, scored 39.Despite a promising start, the Namibian amateurs were always going to struggle chasing the 17th highest team total in one-day history.

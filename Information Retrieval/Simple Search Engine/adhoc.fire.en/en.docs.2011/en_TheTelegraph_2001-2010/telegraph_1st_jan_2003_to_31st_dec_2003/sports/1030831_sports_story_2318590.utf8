The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mary Ann sole leader 
 BY A CORRESPONDENT  L. Romen Singh makes a move during his game on Saturday. It was Romen who won the Guwahati leg of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, and not Rahul Sangma as was erroneously reported in these columns on Saturday. Sangma, however, is the top seed of the ongoing finals Calcutta, Aug. 30: Thirteen-year-old Mary Ann Gomes (six points) of Frank Correa Academy shot into sole lead after the sixth round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan on Saturday. A pack of four  Rahul Sangma, Minhazuddin Ahmed Sagar, Joydeep Dutta and C.R.G. Krishna  are breathing down her neck with 5.5 apiece. Playing her favourite Birds opening, Mary Ann continued her winning spree by disposing off Soumya Thakurta of St James in a mere 23 moves. MaryAnn next meets top seed Rahul Sangma in a crucial encounter which could well decide the fate of the championship. Sangma survived a scare against Anurag Jaiswal of Children Seminary. The top seed at one time was in a losing position as his king was exposed to a dangerous attack. But Anurag faltered and allowed Sangma to escape with a draw. Second seed Akshat Khamparia of Madhya Pradesh went down to Minhazuddin of Bangladesh in a Kings Indian defence. Third seed Tejdeep Adabwala of Andhra Pradesh, too, was beaten  by compatriot C.R.G. Krishna, the 14th seed  in 29 moves in a Slav defence. Sumit Shaw of St Lawrence held Fide-rated Debayan Majumdar of St James to a draw. Ten-year-old Bitan Banerjee of Baruipur HS did well to share the point with Souparno Ghosh of Don Bosco in a Reti opening. Defending champion Joydeep Dutta outwitted Shamima Akter Liza of Bangladesh in just 27 moves in a Slav defence.

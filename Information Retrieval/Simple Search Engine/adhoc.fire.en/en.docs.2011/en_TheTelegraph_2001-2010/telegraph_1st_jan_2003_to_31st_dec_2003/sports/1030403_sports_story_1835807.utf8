 I can bat at any position: Gambhir
New Delhi: Despite his liking for the openers slot, Gautam Gambhir said he was ready to bat at any position in the larger interest of the team. I can bat at any position. I am confident of handling the pressure, no matter whether I come at the top of the order or in the middle, the left-handed Delhi batsman said from Banglaore following his selection in the Indian squad for the tri-series in Dhaka. Gambhir said getting the chance to play for the country is the ultimate aim of every cricketer and he would try to make the most of the opportunity given by the selectors. I am really happy as this is a dream come true for me. I was trying hard to get a place in the team and this is a big reward. I will try my level best to do well and would give my 100 per cent, he said. Gambhir also expressed his gratitude to his family members, friend Vivek and mentor C. K. Khanna, who is the DDCA vice-president as well as the head of the Chand Khanna club for which he plays. It is only because of them that I am here, a jubilant Gambhir added.  Salvi expected call Meanwhile, an overjoyed speedster Avishkar Salvi said he was expecting the national call-up following a good performance in the West Indies tour and injuries to key pacemen Jawagal Srinath and Ashish Nehra. I am very happy. I was overjoyed on hearing I have been selected. To be in the Indian team is always an honour and for me, its a great achievement, the 21-year old said. Salvi, picked in the national squad for the first time, said the absence of Srinath and Nehra, would give him a great chance to prove himself. (PTI)  Copyright

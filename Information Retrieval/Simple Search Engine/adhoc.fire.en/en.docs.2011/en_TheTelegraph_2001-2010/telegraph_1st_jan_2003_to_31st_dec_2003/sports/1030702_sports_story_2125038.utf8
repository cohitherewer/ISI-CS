The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No boycott for RCTC jockeys 
 BY STAR RACER Gowli Calcutta: Despite the Bangalore jockeys, under instruction from the Jockeys Association of India (JAI), are boycotting races there, their Calcutta counterparts say they have got no instruction from JAI and that there will be no boycott here at the Thursday races. All city jockeys, therefore, are looking for rides in the opening day race-card. Clarifying the position, veteran rider Robert Gowli, also a JAI committee member, said, when contacted over phone: We are not under instructions from JAI to refuse rides. We are definitely going to accept rides coming our way. The Bangalore-based JAI members are on strike  demanding a hike in mount fee from the present Rs 750 to Rs 2,000. Gowli, a champion jockey of yesteryear, however, also said that the position could change in the coming weeks if the parent-body (JAI) decides to intensify the stir and directs them to follow the line. Meanwhile, racing during the season is expected to be competitive, thanks to the presence of nearly 260 horses in the Hastings stable. RCTC is expecting 50 more from Bangalore  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 This win more of a team effort
 - Karsan Ghavri recalls Melbourne of 1980-81  BY INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Ghavri feels Souravs captaincy makes the difference Calcutta: It was 23 years ago that India had last won a Test Down Under. On Tuesday as Sourav Gangulys men scripted history at the Adelaide Oval, Karsan Ghavri  a member of Sunil Gavaskars successful team of the 1980-81 Melbourne Test  could not help but turn nostalgic. Two different wins in two different eras... you cant really compare them. The wicket played a major role in our Melbourne win but todays victory is a result of collective effort, Ghavri, who played 39 Tests, told The Telegraph. The pitch in the third and final Test of that series was dreadful. It seemed straight out of an Alfred Hitchcock horror movie, Ghavri explained. It had lots of uneven bounce and batting on the last day was very difficult. It was almost impossible to play shots on that wicket. We (Kapil Dev, Dilip Doshi and myself) just stuck to a tight line and length to make victory possible. Chasing 143, the Aussies were bundled out for 83 on the final day. The Mumbaikar, now coach of Bengal, said the over-the-moon feeling had taken a while to settle down. That win helped us share the series in Australia. Naturally His two wickets late on the fourth evening had made things easier for India. John Dyson and Greg Chappell were dismissed off consecutive balls and then Doshi picked up another to unsettle the hosts. Finally, it was Kapils five for 28 on the fifth day that sealed Australias feat. Gregs wicket was the turning point of the match. He had been scoring runs by the tons in that series, the lowest being 76 prior to that innings. To get him for a duck off the first delivery made a huge difference. He was bowled down the leg-side. I tried to bowl a bouncer as we had discussed at the team meeting that he was slightly uneasy against the rising ball at the outset. He played for the bouncer but the ball skidded through and knocked down the leg stump which was open, recalled Ghavri, who finished with two for 10 in the second innings. The former allrounder observed it was his partnership for the ninth wicket with Shivlal Yadav in the second Test in Adelaide that saved the series. We needed 331 runs in 265 minutes and were reduced to 135 for eight. Shivlal and myself survived the final 9.2 overs in 31 minutes, showing determination and application. It was not a long stand but a very critical one. I managed seven while Shivlal remained unbeaten on nought. The runs werent important and we stuck on. With only Doshi to follow, we would have lost the Test had either of us been dismissed, Ghavri said. The latest success was accomplished thanks to team effort. Dravid, Laxman, Agarkar no ones effort can be belittled. Souravs leadership has also been exemplary. He wears a positive attitude on his sleeves and has been able to pass it on to his teammates. Ghavri feels India can win the series. Brett Lee will be back but so will be Zaheer Khan. Its going to be tough for Australia because the Indians will be determined to do well.  Copyright

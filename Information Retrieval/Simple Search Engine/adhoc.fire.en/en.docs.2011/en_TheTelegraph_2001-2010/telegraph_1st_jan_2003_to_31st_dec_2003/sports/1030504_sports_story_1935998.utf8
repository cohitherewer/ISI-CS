 Four in the fray

Prabir Chakraborty recently resigned as assistant secretary following allegations that he unduly favoured his club Wari in the local tournaments. The term of Sujan Mukherjee, another assistant secretary, ends in June. Meanwhile, Wari club president Nani Chanda has stood by Chakraborty. Chanda felt Chakraborty was a victim of a conspiracy. However, if Chakraborty is sent to represent the club at the CAB in future, he will not be allowed to be a member of the fixtures or tournament committee, Chanda added. Bangar for Tolly Tollygunge Agragami have confirmed Sanjay Bangar, Amay Khurasia and Jai Prakash Yadav for the P. Sen Trophy. The tournament begins tomorrow.  Copyright

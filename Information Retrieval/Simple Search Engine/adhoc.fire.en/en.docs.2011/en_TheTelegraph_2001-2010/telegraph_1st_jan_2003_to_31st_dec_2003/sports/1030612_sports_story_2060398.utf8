 Disciplined WI attack check Lanka
Kingstown, St Vincent: Disciplined work by a new generation of West Indies bowlers restricted Sri Lanka to 191 in the third one-day International on Wednesday. Off-spinner Ryan Hurley and pace bowler Jerome Taylor produced the kind of accurate bowling that might have prevented Sri Lanka from succeeding in their biggest ever run chase on Sunday to clinch the series. Eighteen-year old Taylor showed genuine pace as he completed figures of two for 39 on his international debut. The more experienced Corey Collymore took three for 28, and Marlon Samuels completed two fine run-outs. As on Sunday, it was a stand by Upul Chandana (33) and Mahela Jayawardene (51) that formed the backbone of the Sri Lanka innings. West Indies skipper Brian Lara won the toss and asked the touring side to bat at the Arnos Vale ground. Another young pace bowler, Daren Powell, opened the bowling and was unlucky when Sanath Jayasuriya punished the one loose delivery of the first over with a flashing square cut for six. West Indies made an early breakthrough when Samuels ran out Jayasuriya (8) with a sharp throw on the run. Romesh Kaluwitharana (14) followed him in the seventh over when his attempted hook off Collymore looped up for Lara to take a catch running back from slip. Lara brought on Hurley on in the 10th over, and the spinner produced a maiden on a wicket that was clearly turning. Hurley and Taylor formed a highly effective pairing for much of the next 20 overs as Sri Lanka struggled to break the shackles. Hall has had enough Former West Indian pace bowling legend Wes Hall is not to seek re-election for the presidency of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), adds another report. The 65-year-old revealed Tuesday he would not be standing because of a medical complaint which worsens with the incessant travelling he has to do in his present role. It is with deep regret I have informed the directors of the WICB and the territorial boards, I will not be offering myself for re-election as president of the WICB at the Annual General Meeting on the July 13, 2003, he said in a statement. I am not seeking re-election because of a pre-existing medical condition. (Agencies)  Copyright

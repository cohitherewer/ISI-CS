The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Souravs release date to be decided on Sunday
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  SouravCalcutta: The decision on when to discharge Team India captain Sourav Ganguly from Belle Vue will be taken on Sunday. Earlier, it was expected that the doctors would make an announcement on Saturday. Souravs wound was stitched up today (Friday) and the position should be clear on Sunday, when the next dressing will be done, one of the doctors told The Telegraph. Sourav had the secondary stitches in the morning but, for the rest of the day, was groggy. Given that he required more rest than usual, the no visitors bit was strictly enforced. While Souravs mother was with him throughout, wife Dona (for example) shuttled between his suite and an adjoining one which is being used by the Gangulys as a private visitors room. Meanwhile, the doctors treating Sourav have clarified that the antibiotics course has not been modified. On Thursday, Board president Jagmohan Dalmiyas office conveyed that the Chennai-based Dr Ram Subramanium had recommended modifications. Dr Subramanium made a short visit at the Boards request.

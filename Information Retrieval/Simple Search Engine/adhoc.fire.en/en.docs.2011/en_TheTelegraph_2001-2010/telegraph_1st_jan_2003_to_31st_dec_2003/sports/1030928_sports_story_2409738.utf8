 Indians will play, insist Malaysia
Kuala Lumpur, Sept. 27 (PTI): Putting to rest speculation over Indias participation in next years Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, the Malaysian Hockey Federation (MHF) said on Saturday its Indian counterparts has accepted an invitation to send the team to the tournament. MHF secretary S. Satgunam said India had accepted the invitation to participate in the January 8-18 meet at the Asian Hockey Federation meeting here. Both Amrit Bose (secretary, Indian Womens Hockey Federation) and K. Jothikumaran (secretary, Indian Hockey Federation) agreed to come here for the Azlan Shah next year. Jothikumaran had said on Wednesday that India may be forced to pull out due to lack of a formal invitation and also because the Dutch team was scheduled to play a five-Test series in India around the same time. Satgunam said there was a misunderstanding because Indias name was not included in the list of participating countries on FIH website. The website names six teams and says the seventh team is not confirmed. But we have already invited India.  Copyright

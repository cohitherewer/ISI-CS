 Montoya needs historic win
London: Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya made his mark at Indianapolis three years ago and he could do with making history again at The Brickyard on Sunday. No driver has won both the Indy 500 race and the US Grand Prix at Indianapolis, though Americas Racing Capital of the World hosted the latter event for the first time only in 2000. The swashbuckling Montoya, Indy 500 champion as a rookie on the great banked oval in 2000, and 1995 winner Jacques Villeneuve can both do it, although it would be a sensation if the Canadian came anywhere near to winning in his BAR. The Williams driver, with the imperious swagger of a man who knows what he can do, is the one with a real chance and also a real need to succeed. The 28-year-old Montoya, once described as Colombias favourite export after coffee and cocaine, arrives in Indiana three points behind Ferraris Michael Schumacher with the title in the balance.

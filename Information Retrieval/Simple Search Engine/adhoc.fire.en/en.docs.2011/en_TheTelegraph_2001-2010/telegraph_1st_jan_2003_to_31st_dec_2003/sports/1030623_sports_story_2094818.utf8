 Trescothick hits ton as England clinch series
 Andrew Flintoff celebrates the dismissal of Yasir Hameed at Lords Sunday London: Marcus Trescothick scored an unbeaten 108 and hit a six to win the match as England somehow scraped home against Pakistan by four wickets after an absorbing battle at Lords, sealing the one-day series 2-1. Trescothick, who also engineered Englands triumph in the second match at The Oval with a spectacular 55-ball 86, this time clung on before cautiously shepherding his teammates to victory after a torrid opening followed by a middle-order collapse. The home team rode their luck to win with nine balls remaining, Trescothick putting on a run-a-ball unbeaten stand of 77 with wicketkeeper Chris Read (25 not out). England, having put Pakistan in and restricted them to 229 for seven despite an explosive display of late hitting by Abdul Razzaq, looked well placed after surviving an opening barrage of extreme pace from Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Sami. But having reached 89 for one, they then caved in to the off spin of Mohammad Hafeez, who took three for three in 17 balls as four wickets tumbled for 25. England needed 62 from the last 10 overs but, in rapidly deteriorating light, Trescothick, having been almost run out on two occasions and dropped on 35 and then 93, received staunch support from Read. England, who could have lost six wickets in the opening 10 overs against the hugely impressive Shoaib and Sami, had all the luck going and it was fitting that Trescothick completed his century off an edge through the slip area off Shoaib. Trescothick reached three figures for the fifth time in one-dayers off 142 balls. Despite the thrilling finish, however, the game was most memorable for Pakistans opening burst of pace bowling. Earlier all rounder Andrew Flintoff took four for 32 in 10 overs for England. (reuters)  Copyright

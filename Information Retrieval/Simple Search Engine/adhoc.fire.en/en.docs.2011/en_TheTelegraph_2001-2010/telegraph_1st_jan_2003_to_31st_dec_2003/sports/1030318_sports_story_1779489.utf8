The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I didnt take captaincy too seriously: Taylor
For many, cricket is about life and death... For me, it was a sport only... By treating it that way, I was able to relax
	 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Port Elizabeth: From the mid-Nineties till he quit, in early 1999, Mark Taylor was the finest captain around. Aggressive, innovative, fiercely competitive... He finished with a handsome 26 wins and 13 losses in Tests and also had a plus-percentage in ODIs  36 victories to 30 defeats. Clearly, he is qualified to talk about captaincy.Taylor, doing TV duty in the World Cup, did just that Monday morning when he spoke to The Telegraph at the Holiday Inn (Kings Beach). Owing to an exclusive contract with Channel Nine, Taylor didnt make any reference to the tournament. In fact, his contract prevented him from talking about Sourav Ganguly  who has been outstanding in this World Cup.Incidentally, Taylor was captain when Australia made the 1996 final.The following are excerpts On the qualities a captain must haveTwo readily come to mind... The ability to understand players on and off the field and the ability to communicate. Captaincy isnt ever confined to the field and dressing room... Then, a captain must have the skills to put his views across in a manner understood by everybody. Also, this line of communication should be two-way as the players, too, may wish to communicate something. A captain must not be a schoolmaster, instructing the boys on what to do. A good communicator is one who is an equally good listener.On whether he had a role model captainI certainly looked at a lot of captains... Ian Chappell, Allan Border, Mohammed Azharuddin... I imbibed what could be beneficial and ignored what wouldnt work for me... Ive no qualms admitting I generally grabbed bits of information from people around me... Of course, I didnt model my captaincy on any one captain.On his approach to captaincy(Laughs) I didnt take it too seriously... For many, cricket is about life and death... For me, it was a sport only. By treating it that way, I was able to relax and go about the captaincy in a better manner. On the criteria in picking his top five captainsExcept for Chappell, Ive chosen the ones I played with and against. Ive deliberately not gone back in time.On his top five (alphabetically)  AzharuddinIan chappell Imran KhanSteve Waugh Steven Fleming AZHARUDDIN: Probably didnt captain by consensus, but adopted the approach he thought was right... The impression I got is that the players knew exactly what was expected of them. I specially liked Azhars field settings for the spinners  used to be very good. (After a pause) Where Im concerned, the match-fixing controversy hasnt taken anything away from his captaincy... Doesnt come into my equation. CHAPPELL: He enjoyed results and, so, was for attacking cricket. Boring draws didnt fit into his scheme of things... In fact, my approach was just the same. He will be remembered for injecting that aggressive nature into our cricket. STEPHEN FLEMING: Takes a stand and doesnt flinch... He knows the limitations of his players and gets the best out of them. If he takes a punt, its calculated... The usual reaction of a team that isnt strong enough is to play defensively  but not New Zealand under Fleming... He wont sit back hoping for a draw and mistakes from an opposition that, on paper, is stronger... Fleming was superb in Australia last season.IMRAN KHAN: Obviously knew his players very well... Led from the front, kept his team together and gambled with purpose. A very fine leader. STEVE WAUGH: Its difficult assessing somebody you played with for a number of years but, then, Steve has done such an outstanding job... He inherited a tough side and made it tougher... Moreover, the present team is playing even more aggressively than when I was captain.Finally, his advice to captains-in-the-makingDont take it too seriously. Everybody wants to be a winner and theres pressure in plenty, but, treat cricket like a sport and not an issue of life and death. In any case, if the enjoyment isnt there, you wont be successful. (After a pause) I dont think one-day cricket allows a captain to be as good as he can be, but  Copyright

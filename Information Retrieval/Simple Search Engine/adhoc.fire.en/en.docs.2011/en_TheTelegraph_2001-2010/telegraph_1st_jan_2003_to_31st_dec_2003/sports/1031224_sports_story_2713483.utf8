The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Afridi critical of umpires
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Jawagal Srinath, who made his debut as Match Referee in the Pakistan A-Sri Lanka A tie, at the Eden on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: The ICC has imposed sanctions against captains being critical of umpiring in public. The triangular tournament for A teams is not regarded as an official ODI series and Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi chose the occasion to criticise the umpires at the post-match press conference on Tuesday. A few umpiring decisions went against us. Russel Arnold survived a couple of close leg-before calls and Salman Butt was adjudged leg-before when the ball had actually taken the inside edge on to the pads, Afridi said. These decisions made a big impact on our performance, he added. It remains to be seen if Match Referee Jawagal Srinath initiates any action.  Afridi felt the loss would serve as a wake-up call to his players ahead of their key clash against India A on Thursday. India are also struggling, having lost their opener in almost identical fashion. So, in that respect, it can be said that we are on the same platform, Afridi said. He informed that Imran Nazir was uncertain for the next game after suffering a back problem. Pacer Mohammed Irshad was still not fully fit. Sri Lanka A captain Russel Arnold said he was very happy with the way things have gone so far. Its pleasing to note that success has been with us. It may look as if chasing 300 was easy but both games have been real tough. Our objective was to stay positive, keep batting till the very end and try and get as close to the target as possible. After that, it was just that things fell into place for us, he explained. With unbeaten knocks of 96 and 100 in two games, Arnold did not wish to send out any specific signals to the selectors back home. Ive got to keep scoring runs just to let them know that Im around and keep impressing them.  Copyright

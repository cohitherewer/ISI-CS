 Sonn flayed for playing truant
Durban: United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) president Percy Sonn has come under scathing attack for skipping a parliamentary hearing on cricket transformation in the country. Sports minister Ngconde Balfour, who attended the briefing by UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola, strongly condemned Sonn for not turning up. It is a huge problem when the president of a national federation is not present after being invited by a committee of parliament, Balfour said. Parliamentary sports committee chairperson Ruth Bhengu was also unsparing. She said it was not good enough that Sonn had other professional engagements in Johannesburg. She said if the countrys cricket body was committed to transformation and change then you have to address the attitude of your president, advocate Sonn. His attitude is not helpful to you, the UCBSA and also the country. Sonn struck a defiant posture, saying he did not have to answer for his actions. It is rank arrogance to ask where I was and what I was doing, he said on Wednesday when asked by a reporter why he had not attended the meeting. I was not asked to be there personally, it was a UCBSA matter. Sonn also declined to respond to Bhengus criticism. The UCBSA has also come to its chiefs defence. Spokesperson Bronwyn Wilkinson said: It is unfortunate that the issue of advocate Sonns being there, or not, has overtaken the contents of the report on transformation in cricket . (PTI)  Copyright

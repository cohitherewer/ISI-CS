 Kallis to return on Tuesday 
London: South Africa allrounder Jacques Kallis will return to England on Tuesday after missing the first two Tests following the death of his father. South Africas media manager Gerald de Kock announced the news at Lords on Friday, adding: He will rejoin the touring squad in the morning and probably play both games next week. The third Test of the five-match series between South Africa and England begins at Trent Bridge on August 14. South Africa warm up for the match with a one-dayer on Wednesday, followed immediately by a three-day game against Kent at Canterbury. Kallis attended the funeral of his father, Henry, in Cape Town on Monday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

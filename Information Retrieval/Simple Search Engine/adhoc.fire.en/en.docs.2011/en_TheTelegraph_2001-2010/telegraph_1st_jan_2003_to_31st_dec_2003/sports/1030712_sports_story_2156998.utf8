 Aussie greats feel the Don is for always
 Don Bradman Sydney: Australian Test greats Arthur Morris, Steve Waugh and Bill Brown claim Don Bradman would still be averaging around 100 runs per innings if he was playing Test cricket today. As 150 of Australias 197 living Test players attended a gala function here Friday to receive commemorative baggy green caps, the incomparable deeds of The Don remained the subject of widespread discussion and disbelief. Hed be averaging 99 these days, believe me, and he might even get himself up over the 100 because Sir Donald Bradman was a unique batsman, said Morris, who was a member of Bradmans 1948 Invincibles touring team to England. He was a great, great player. He had tremendous determination and concentration and he had all the shots. He was amazing. We really cant compare anyone with. Nobody comes close. There have been very good fast bowlers over the years but there were very good fast bowlers in his day, too. Bodyline (Englands 1932-33 tour to Australia) was impossible to bat against. If you had all the fast bowlers of today, bowling straight at the head with six fellas on the leg side, how would they go? Bradman had to play against that, and he didnt have a helmet. The question of how Bradman, who averaged 99.94 in 52 Tests between 1928 and 1948, would fare against the finest bowlers of recent times such as Curtly Ambrose, Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner, Wasim Akram, Richard Hadlee and Muttiah Muralidharan is one that fascinates contemporary cricket followers. Brown and Morris, who both played with Bradman, and current Test captain Waugh, Australias most capped player, believe Bradman was so good he would have dominated any era. Waugh nodded to the suggestion Bradmans average would be 100-odd, saying: If he dominated his era, I think its fair to say hed dominate any era, including ours. A genius is a genius. Thats probably the most simple way you can put it. Brown agreed. He would have been successful whenever he played, one-day cricket, anything, said Australias oldest Test survivor, who will be 91 later this month. He was just the complete player who seemed to be able to bat as long as he wanted to. He would just go on, 100, 200, 300 and on one occasion 400. Thats just unbelievable to the average bloke. His record would be little different, I think.  (AFP)  Copyright

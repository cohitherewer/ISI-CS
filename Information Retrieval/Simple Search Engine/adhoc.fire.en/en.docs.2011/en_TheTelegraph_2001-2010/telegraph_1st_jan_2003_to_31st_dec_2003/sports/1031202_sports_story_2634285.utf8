 Mohanty floors Maharashtra 
Cuttack: Former India paceman Debasish Mohanty (five for 24) bowled a fine spell as Orissa skittled out Maharashtra for a paltry 77 on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy Plate Group match at the Barabati Stadium here Monday. Captain Hrishikesh Kanitkars decision to bat first backfired as Mohanty swung the ball to good effect breaking the backbone of Maharahstra batting. Sanjay Satpathy picked up three wickets without conceding any run. Orissa were comfortably placed at 160 for four with Rashmi Ranjan Parida on 81.

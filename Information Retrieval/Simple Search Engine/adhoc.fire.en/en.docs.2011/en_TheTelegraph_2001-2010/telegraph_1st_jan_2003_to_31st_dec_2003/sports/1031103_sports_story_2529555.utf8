The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Experimentation should continue
 - The never-say-die attitude should stand Indian team in  good stead
 Stickwork / Gurbux Singh		 Gagan Ajit has the attributes of becoming  a great playerIndia reaped a rich harvest at  the Afro-Asian Games, finishing only behind China in the  medals tally. However exciting that may sound, we must  not forget it was possible because most of the heavyweights  took these Games casually. They didnt bother to enter teams  in some disciplines, while in others, they fielded second-string  players. Hockey was an exception. Heavyweights from both  continents vied for glory and even though some big names  were missing, competition was not at a premium. The gold won by Rajinder Singhs  team is, in fact, a big shot in the arm for hockey in our  country. Having stood on the winners podium at the Asia  Cup in Kuala Lumpur just about a month ago, this back-to-back  triumph will help the process of hockeys revival gain further  momentum. There have been occasions in the past two decades  when the game seemed to be on the verge of the big breakthrough  but potential never got translated into results. Rajinders men seem to have realised  that the only way to come to the forefront is by winning  more and more matches, and tournaments. And thats why the  Indian players deserve all the kudos they are getting. It  was really heart-warming to see them beating Pakistan twice  in the same tournament. That too, in front of packed galleries. Pakistan dominated India in the  first half of the final, but the hosts did well to turn  it around and, in the end, win convincingly. Even in the  semi-final, we struggled to put the ball into the Malaysian  net but the boys hung on and ultimately won via the tie-breaker.  Its this never-say-die spirit which should stand this team  in good stead. Dhanraj Pillay, Baljit Dhillon  and Baljit Saini were rested by the Indian Hockey Federation  for this tournament. I whole-heartedly support this policy  because I believe that unless you are prepared to experiment,  the future will be bleak. Trying out the bench-strength  as frequently as possible not only boosts the confidence  of fringe players, it also keeps senior and established  players on their toes. Absolutely nobody should take  his place for granted and the Pillays, Dhillons and Sainis  must know they have to fight their way back into the team.  You need competition to bring the best out of every player. Theres another positive side  to experimentation: it can unearth players who, otherwise,  may have faded into oblivion after warming the benches for  a series of tournaments. Harpal Singh, for example, gave  a good account of himself when he got the chance. The young  full-back charged out well while defending penalty corners  and headed straight towards the man taking the hit  an  art Jugraj Singh had mastered.  Among the other non-regulars on  view in Hyderabad, Arjun Halappa operated at a fast pace  down the right flank. We could be needing someone like him  because most of our attack is left-oriented with the trio  of Prabhjot Singh, Deepak Thakur and Gagan Ajit Singh forming  an effective combination. I was happy to see Dilip Tirkey,  who led the team in Pillays absence, playing solid hockey  in defence. He is gradually regaining peak form which he  was on the verge of losing earlier this year, and that really  augurs well for the Indian team. Another standout performer was  Devesh Chauhan. This well-built man always had the qualities  to be a top-class goalkeeper, but his problem was inconsistency.  He would effect two fine saves and then let in a soft goal.  In Hyderabad, Chauhan maintained a rich vein of form right  through the tournament. Both in the semi-final and final,  it was his brilliance which saved India. Then how can one ignore Gagan  Ajits contribution? He has made it a habit of scoring fabulous  goals against Pakistan. Thats the hallmark of a great player   he rises with the level of competition and produces the  goods in crunch situations. Hes not a forward with great  individual skills but a very good scorer. Previously, he  had this penchant for pulling the ball to his left and scoring  with reverse-flicks. In the Afro-Asian final, it was good  to see him score from his right side as well. The other good quality Gagan Ajit  possesses is a very cool head. The Pakistanis always try  to upset him, but Gagan Ajit doesnt get flustered.  As far as the Indians are concerned,  the year is closing on as high a note as it had begun. But  we cant afford to rest on our laurels, especially as an  Olympic year is knocking on the doors. Though nothing can  be taken for granted, I would be very surprised if we fail  to book our ticket to Athens. I have one simple piece of advice  for the team management: just continue the process of experimentation  in the forthcoming Test series against the Dutch, then  the Azlan Shah meet and Olympic qualifiers in Spain. Thats  the best way to prepare for Athens. Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United win 
London, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Ruud van Nistelrooys second-half double gave champions Manchester United a 2-0 win at Charlton Athletic in the Premier League on Saturday. The Dutchman pounced in the 62nd and 81st minutes to move United just a point behind leaders Arsenal who lost their 100 per cent record in a 1-1 home draw with Portsmouth. Chelsea moved into third place after prolific Romanian Adrian Mutu scored twice in a 4-2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur, while Liverpool beat 10-man Blackburn Rovers 3-1.  Copyright

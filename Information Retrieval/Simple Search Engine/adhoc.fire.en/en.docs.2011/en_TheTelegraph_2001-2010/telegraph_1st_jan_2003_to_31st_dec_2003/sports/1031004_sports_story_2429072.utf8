				 																																	Metz: Mary Pierce could step in for France in their Fed Cup semi-final against Russia next month if Nathalie Dechy fails to recover from a wrist injury in time.				 																																	Captain Guy Forget said on Thursday that Dechy was still unable to practise and that he had talked to Pierce about her playing her first Fed Cup match since 1997 alongside Amelie Mauresmo.				 																																	If she (Dechy) opts out, it would be preferable to have Mary Pierce. At Wimbledon I saw her win some good matches even though she was far from fit, Forget said. Since then she has become much fitter. I have talked to her on the phone and she is very keen to rejoin the team.				 																																	Madrid: David Beckham returned to training at Real Madrid on Friday after recovering from the foot injury that kept him out of the Spanish sides Champions League game against Porto.				 																																	Real said on their website that the former Manchester United midfielder would be fit to join the squad for Sundays league game at home to Espanyol. Beckham suffered injury to this right foot in Reals 2-0 defeat by Valencia last weekend .				 																																	Sydney: Drug testing has been underway for the past three months and almost 600 dope tests will have been conducted by the end of the World Cup, the International Rugby Board (IRB) said on Friday. Weve done 195 tests in the past three months on the 20 participating unions, so thats about 10 tests per union, IRB AntiDoping manager Tim Ricketts said.				 																																	Weve been working away and testing teams when theyve been playing warmups, he said. The IRB was still waiting for 15 results but that all the others had been negative.				 																																	Lisbon: Britains Paula Radcliffe heads the field at the world half-marathon championships on Saturday on a flat course at the Portuguese beach resort of Vilamoura.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 They need all the exposure
 - Waugh lauds Bangladeshs morale-boosting victory over Northern Territory CMs XI  Steve Waugh is looking forward to a new venture Darwin: Steve Waugh says his Australian cricket team aims to put on a good show against Bangladesh here this week. Waugh arrived here Sunday unmoved by critics of the two-Test series between the top and bottom-ranked sides who have predicted all sorts of Test records will tumble. Former Test batsman David Hookes said last week Bangladesh didnt deserve to be in Test cricket and urged the Australians to try to win the first Test, starting Friday, within one day. Bookies are offering odds of 17-1 on that happening. But Waugh said speculation about how long the match would run was more a problem for the media. Its exciting, its a new venue for us all, weve never played Bangladesh in a Test before, in a Test series, so were looking forward to the challenge of playing up here, Waugh said. At this stage of Bangladeshs experience to play against the supposed top five in world cricket is important. Waugh was pleased Bangladesh pulled off a second consecutive morale-boosting victory here Sunday when they downed the Northern Territory Chief Ministers XI by two wickets following a narrow win over the Australian Cricket Academy in Brisbane. Its good to see, said Waugh. Emerging sides, they need a lot of match practice. Theyve played a couple of good games and Im sure their form is okay. We havent played much cricket in the last four or five weeks so it should be a good contest, he said. We expect it to be a Test match and were going to play as hard as we can, Waugh said. I dont know what the result is going to be, but we play as if its going to be a tough Test match. He gave little indication whether Australia would continue the tactic of playing five specialist bowlers which was used on the recent West Indies tour when pacemen Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie, Brett Lee and Andrew Bichel were joined by spinner Stuart MacGill. Well go in with the best balanced side possible, he said. The West Indies wre a bit different because the wickets were slow and low. We needed an extra bowler. If we think we need that, well go with that mix again. Its going to be a big crowd up here and we want to put on a good show. Bangladesh may play well and you never know, thats what sport is all about. It doesnt matter if you beat them by a massive margin or a single run, thats what its about. Waugh can achieve another personal milestone if he can score a century in the two Tests as it would mean he has a century against every Test nation. I havent played a Test match against these guys and neither have any of the other players, so to score a 100 is something to look forward to but theres a lot of work to be done before that, he said. The 38-year-old skipper refused to be drawn on whether the Australian team was playing too much cricket  or his retirement plans. Final warm-up Bangladesh Sunday lifted their spirits with a two-wicket victory in their final warm-up match. Bangladesh held on for the tense victory over the Northern Territory Chief Ministers XI, after being set a second innings target of 187. The win followed a narrow victory over the Australian Cricket Academy team in Brisbane the previous week. After a first innings score of 139  50 lower than the local invitational teams tally  the Bangladesh bowlers restricted the Territory to just 136 in their second innings on Saturday. Starting the fourth and final day at 90 for four, the Bangladeshis were equal to the challenge, despite the loss of three quick wickets for eight runs late in the game. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore said the win would help the teams confidence. I attribute the victory to our second innings bowling, Whatmore said. We had a deficit of 50 runs and real desire. To get the opposition out again for that total was very exemplary, very pleasing  the effort was fantastic. That was what brought us into the game. Whatmore said the team had improved across the board during their three warm-up matches. Even with the batting, I think theres clear evidence in this innings that we werent presenting our wickets, gifting them. Javed Omar top-scored with 44 before falling leg before to Adrian McAdam. Middle-order batsman Al-Sahariar contributed 41 and tail-enders Khaled Mahmud (12 not out) and Mashrafe Mortaza (4 not out) took their side to victory.  (AFP)  Copyright

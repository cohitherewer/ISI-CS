 Sourav to be feted on May 1
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has decided to felicitate India captain Sourav Ganguly for the teams impressive performance in the recently concluded World Cup in South Africa. At its Working Committee meeting Friday, the CAB decided that Sourav will be felicitated at the presence of present and former Bengal players at the state association premises on May 1. Among other things, the committee criticised Bengals poor performance in the Ranji Trophy this season. Association president Jagmohan Dalmiya himself has decided to look into the matter. Dalmiya has already issued a directive to Bengal selectors that they will have to watch at least 60 per cent of the local matches.  Copyright

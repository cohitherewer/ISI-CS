The Telegraph - Calcutta
 One bad game, rues Bhupathi
  BY A STAFF REPORTER Mahesh Bhupathi feels he and Max Mirnyi lost momentum in the decider Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi sounded devastated, even hours after he and Max Mirnyi had lost Tuesdays French Open mens doubles quarter final to Leander Paes and David Rikl.For a set and three quarters, we played some of our best tennis.

His mental maturity is great for the team. He kept looking at me and nudging me and saying be patient it will come.

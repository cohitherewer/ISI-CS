The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Todays matches deferred
 BY A STAFF REPORTER SUPER DIVISION Calcutta: When Subrata Dutta took over as the IFA secretary, he had said he would stick to his schedule. He tried, but the vagaries of the sport in this state forced his hand rather early into the Super Division league. Mohammedan Sporting and Tollygunge Agragami both had matches Friday, according to the original fixtures. Now they dont. Mohammedan Sportings rivals, Eastern Railway have complained that they would be playing too many matches while Ever-Ready would not. They demanded parity . Ever-Readys matches had been put off due to rain, East Bengals inability, Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advanis visit etc. That was fair enough, and I agreed to a change, said Dutta. This has resulted in Mohammedan Sportings next match being on July 17, versus West Bengal Police. We had a match on July 15, versus Bhratri Sangha, but since that match was scheduled for Salt Lake Stadium, it will not be held because no police permission is available in view of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees visit, said Sultan Ahmed secretary of Mohammedan Sporting. The other two matches that day, of Mohun Bagan and Tollygunge, will not be affected because they are Maidan matches.  East Bengal win 11-0 East Bengal thrashed India Club 11-0 in a practice match for the ASEAN Cup in Jakarta Thursday. According to information received, Bhaichung scored three and Mike Okoro two.

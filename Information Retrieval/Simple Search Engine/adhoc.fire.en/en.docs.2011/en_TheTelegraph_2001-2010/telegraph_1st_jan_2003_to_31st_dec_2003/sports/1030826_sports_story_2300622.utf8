 Humpy, Harika in Indian 1-2
 Kozhikode: Ending Chinese domination, Indias  Koneru Humpy and D. Harika grabbed the gold and silver medals,  respectively, in the tenth Asian womens chess championship  which concluded on Monday.  GM Humpy established her supremacy by finishing with  seven points in the nine-round meet. Harika pushed Vietnams  Hoang Thanh Trang to the third spot on better average score.  Both had 6.5 points. WGM S. Vijayalakshmi, who was in contention for the title until she drew her eighth round game with Zhang Jilin of China, lost to Trang Xu Yuanyuan, also of China. Xu finished fourth with six points in the tournament which had been dominated by Chinese players for several years. Defending champion Li Ruofan finished a poor ninth after drawing her last game with Tania Sachdev. Humpy ensured the first spot by drawing Le Kieu Thien Kim of Vietnam. The Vijayawada player thus justified her top billing. Harika convincingly beat Wang Yu of China in the final round.  Being the winner, Humpy qualified for the world championship.  The top 12 from this meet also made the cut and the list  includes five more Indians  Harika, Vijayalakshmi, Bhagyashree  Thipsay, Tania and Aarthie Ramaswamy.  (PTI)  Copyright

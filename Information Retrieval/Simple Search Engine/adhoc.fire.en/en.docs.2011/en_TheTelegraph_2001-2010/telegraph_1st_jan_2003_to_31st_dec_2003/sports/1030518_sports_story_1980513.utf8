(AP) Kingston, May 17 (Agencies): Australia reached 270 for five off their 50 overs in the opening one-day International with the West Indies at Sabina Park on Saturday. Michael Bevan (43) and Ian Harvey (48) put up a quickfire unbeaten 87-run partnership in 10.2 overs for the sixth wicket to provide an acceleration to Australias run-rate towards the end. Earlier, skipper Ricky Ponting top-scored with 59 and Darren Lehmann hit 51 as the duo steadied the innings after Australia lost both openers with 47 runs on the board. Mervyn Dillon and Omari Banks took two wickets each while Chris Gayle claimed the other wicket. The world champions were off to a rollicking start with Adam Gilchrist leading the charge. Matthew Hayden, who scored a century in the last Test of the series, was subdued as Gilchrist stepped on the accelerator. The first six overs produced 35 runs. Gilchrist was severe on Vasbert Drakes, the fast bowler conceding 29 runs in his first five overs. The wicketkeeper-batsmans 21 came off 26 balls and included four boundaries. Hayden managed to score only seven and lasted 17 balls. Dillon picked both the wickets. Dillons first spell read 6-1-23-2. The West Indians named three ODI debutants in the XI  Devon Smith, Banks and Carlton Baugh.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arnold at it again as Lanka master 300
 - Pakistan suffer just what Indians did in Eden run-feast  BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: One Mr Russel Arnold had doomed Indias day at the Eden Gardens on Monday. A day later it was Pakistans turn to suffer the humiliation. The Sri Lankan A side seems to have made it a habit of chasing 300-plus targets successfully. For the second successive day Arnold led his side to victory in the Kenstar Asian A championship. His unbeaten century guided Lanka to a convincing five-wicket win. Despite chasing a mammoth target, not for a moment did the islanders seem to be in any sort of panic. They went about their task in a cool, composed and professional manner. There was no lusty hitting. It was a disciplined effort as the batsmen waited patiently for the loose deliveries that flowed quite generously from the Pakistan bowlers. In the end, Shahid Afridi was critical of his bowlers but was also taken aback by the way in which Lanka had achieved the impossible. I think 4000 runs would have been safe on this wicket! The ball was coming onto the bat at an even pace, making the task of the strokemakers that bit easier on this pitch. Arnolds 100 not out (105 balls, 12x4, 2x6) came about in calculated fashion and involved an 81-run partnership for the third wicket with S. Kalavitigoda. The latter played the supportive role to perfection. Kalavitigoda was also involved in a 77-run stand for the second wicket with Jehan Mubarak. Pakistan managed to create a few flutters with a couple of wickets in the closing stages but that was until Arnold decided to settle the issue with a four and a six in the 49th over from Abdur Rouf Khan. That Pakistan A managed to reach the 300-mark was largely due to a brisk start by Afridi. The skipper, who has been in and out of the senior national side, chose the occasion to send the right signals to the selectors back home. He toyed with the pacers line and length and never let the bowling settle into a rhythm early on. Eight fours and three huge sixes studded his 63 off 47 balls but, more importantly, it was enough to rattle the bowlers psyche. Having survived once, Afridi added 73 runs for the second wicket with Salman Butt and finally fell to one that turned the other way from Herath. The first 15 overs yielded 119 runs and it looked as if there was no way Pakistan could squander the game from there. That Lanka still managed to apply the brakes in the middle-stages of the Pakistan innings was mainly due to the efforts of left-arm spinner Herath and off-spinner Sanam Jayantha. Their joy was, however, shortlived as Pakistan managed to claw back through Bilal Asads blazing knock in the closing stages. If Afridi and Asad had laid the foundation and the climax of the innings, respectively, with scintillating knocks, Faizal Iqbal held the innings together with a disciplined and composed half-century off 77 balls. Their last two wickets added 57 runs in less than eight overs. One aspect that stood out was Lankas superb fielding. They saved nearly 30-odd runs through the agility and enthusiasm of their youngsters on the field. Prasanna Jaywardenes wicketkeeping was also encouraging. His anticipation was impressive and he showed lot of promise in his role behind the wickets. For the record, Jawagal Srinath made his debut as Match Referee. Thankfully, he did not have much to deal about.  Copyright

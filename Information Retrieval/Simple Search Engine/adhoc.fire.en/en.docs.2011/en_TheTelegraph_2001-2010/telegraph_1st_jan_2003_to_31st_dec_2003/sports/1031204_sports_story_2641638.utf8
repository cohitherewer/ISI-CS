 Pak clinch series
Faisalabad: Pakistan beat New Zealand by 51 runs in the third one-day International here on Wednesday to wrap up the five-match series 3-0. Hamish Marshall completed his maiden century (101 not out) as the Black Caps finished on 263 for seven, chasing 314 for seven. Marshall batted without much support for 109 balls, hitting seven boundaries and two sixes. Earlier, opener Imran Farhat missed out on his maiden ODI century by nine runs as Pakistan built up a mammoth total after Inzamam-ul Haq opted for first strike. Inzamam, who made 25, became the seventh player overall (and second Pakistani) to appear in 300 one-day Internationals.  (AFP)  Copyright

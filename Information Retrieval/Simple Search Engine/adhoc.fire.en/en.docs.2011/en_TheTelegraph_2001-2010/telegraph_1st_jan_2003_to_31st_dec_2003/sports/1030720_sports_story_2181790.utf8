 Jaffers 90 before Pollock strikes 
 Jaffer hit a superb knock Arundel, July 19 (PTI): Wasim Jaffer came up with a superb 90 as India A scored a healthy 319 all out on the opening day of the three-day match against South Africa on Saturday.Walking in at the fall of opener Gautam Gambhirs wicket just before lunch, Jaffer produced his best knock on the tour before he was the sixth man out well into the last session. Jaffer hit 12 fours in his 147-ball knock that lasted 202 minutes. For South Africa, Shaun Pollock took four wickets and Dewald Pretorius grabbed three in the last session as India A slid from 195 for three at tea to 319 all out in 89 overs at stumps.Earlier, electing to bat, India were off to a solid start with skipper Shiv Sundar Das (33) and Gambhir (64) adding 93 runs blunting the South African attack. Gambhir, who recorded his second century on the tour against County champions Surrey on Wednesday, continued his fine form hitting 11 fours in his 69 ball knock.Former captain Pollock, who only arrived back in England on Friday after visiting his pregnant wife Tricia in South Africa, produced a second new ball spell of three wickets for one run in seven balls that ended the innings.

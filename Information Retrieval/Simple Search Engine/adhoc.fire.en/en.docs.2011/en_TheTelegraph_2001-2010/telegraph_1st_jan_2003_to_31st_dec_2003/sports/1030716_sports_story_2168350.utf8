The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sania tops doubles rankings
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sania Mirza Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes have both scaled the peak, some four years ago. Now, we have a third world No. 1 in doubles  this time from the distaff side, as a pleasant variation. Sania Mirza, the Hyderabad girl who will be turning 17 in four months time, has been listed as the top player in the International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior girls doubles rankings issued Monday. This was on the cards since the day she and Russian partner Alisa Kleybanova lifted the Wimbledon girls doubles title on the final day of the Championships to earn 180 ranking points. But as per the ITF rankings issued after Wimbledon got over, Sania was only No. 4. The discrepancy arose as Wimbledon did not grant the full quota of 180 points (including Grand Slam bonus) to the champions. It was apparently because the frequent rain interruptions at this years grasscourt Grand Slam meet forced the organisers to truncate the draw size of some of the junior events. Following protests and requests for clarification from several quarters on the new points structure followed at Wimbledon, the Grand Slam committee met over the weekend and decided to revert to the existing system. The 180 points in her bag, Sania is well and truly ensconced at No. 1. Her tally of 790 puts her a full hundred points ahead of the second-placed Kristen Flipkens of Belgium. At No. 4 is Sanias Wimbledon partner Alisa  a significant improvement from her 15th place ITF had awarded her last week. PTI adds from Hyderabad: Sanias focus, meanwhile, has shifted to a coach and sponsors. The countrys first ever female to clinch a Grand Slam crown is keen to get a solid financial hand which can help her work with a good coach. Some names (of coaches) and institutions (sponsors) have come up during recent discussion but we are still waiting for things to take a concrete shape, an official of the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh said. Mahesh Bhupathi, who has taken Sania under his company Globosports fold, has been holding discussions with the state officials on these issues. Sania trains with Mahesh and his father at the Bhupathis academy in Bangalore. Andhra chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu announced after Sanias Wimbledon conquest that the state government would do its bit to identify and engage a foreign coach for the teenager.  Copyright

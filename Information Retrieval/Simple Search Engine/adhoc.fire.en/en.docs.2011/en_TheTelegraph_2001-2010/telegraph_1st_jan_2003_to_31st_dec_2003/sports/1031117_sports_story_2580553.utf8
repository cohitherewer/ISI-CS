The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indian batting Akrams pick
Mumbai: Wasim Akram feels India have the talent to counter the Aussies when they tour Down Under later this month. The Indians have a very good batting line-up with Sachin, Rahul and Laxman  all capable of tackling the Aussie pace, Akram said. He also felt India have a talented bowling line-up at their disposal. India have a lot of talented players but playing the Aussies in Australia is a totally different ball game. If their pace bowlers, particularly Zaheer and Ashish get their act together, then it could turn out to be an interesting series, he added. Talking about his own future, the legendary paceman said: I am planning to start a bowling academy in Karachi in near future, though nothing is finalised as yet. Right now, I am totally concentrating on TV commentary, he added. Akram also expressed optimism that the forthcoming Indo-Pak Test series to be played in Pakistan next year will be a big hit. Im sure millions of people from both sides will be looking forward to the series which promises to be a real thriller, Akram said. Indo-Pak contest in any sport has always generated keen interest all over the world and a Test series between the two is considered almost on a par with the Ashes, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

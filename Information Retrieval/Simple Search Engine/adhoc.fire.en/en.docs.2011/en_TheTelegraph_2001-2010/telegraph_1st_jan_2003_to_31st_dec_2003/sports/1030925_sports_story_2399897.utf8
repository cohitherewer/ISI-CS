The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA reach Pak on Sept. 29
Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Wednesday announced the South African team will arrive next week after endorsing a revised itinerary rescheduling all five one-day matches and two Tests in the relatively peaceful province of Punjab. The itinerary was sent to the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) and is now approved with the South African team likely to arrive on September 29, PCB spokesman Samiul Hasan said. It (UCBSA) still has to inform us about the exact date of arrival, Hasan added. South African cricket officials have already agreed to a shortened tour of Pakistan after PCB dropped the volatile cities of Karachi and Peshawar over their security fears. A bomb blast in Karachi on Friday prompted UCBSA to cancel the tour over the weekend but changed their mind after PCBs furious reaction and International Cricket Council (ICC) intervention. All the matches in the new programme are distributed in Lahore, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad and we felt sorry for the people of Karachi and Peshawar but the decision was taken to save the tour, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said on Tuesday. The South Africans were earlier scheduled to play a warm-up one-day, a one-day International and a Test in the port city of Karachi and one Test in Peshawar, which borders Afghanistan. In the revised itinerary, South Africans will play a warm-up one-day game in Lahore and then play the first of the five one-day games in the same city two days later. The two Tests will be played in Lahore and Faisalabad. REVISED ITINERARY Sept. 29: Arrival in Lahore; Oct. 1: One-day game in Lahore; Oct. 3: First ODI in Lahore; Oct. 5: Second ODI in Lahore; Oct. 7: Third ODI in Faisalabad; Oct. 10: Fourth ODI in Rawalpindi; Oct. 12: Fifth ODI in Rawalpindi; Oct. 17-21: First Test in Lahore; Oct. 24-28: Second Test in Faisalabad.

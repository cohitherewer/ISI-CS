 Pak complete NZ whitewash
 - Hameed, Farhat stitch together fourth successive century opening partnership  Yasir Hameed after  reaching his century on Sunday  Imran Farhat celebrates  his ton in Rawalpindi. (AFP)Rawalpindi: Pakistan completed a clean sweep of the five-match one-day series against New Zealand on Sunday with a 49 runs-win in the final match. It was the eighth time Pakistan have recorded a clean sweep in a one-day series at home and their second of the home season after a 5-0 defeat of Bangladesh in September. The foundation on Sunday was laid by openers Yasir Hameed (127 not out) and Imran Farhat (107) who put on 197 to set Pakistan on their way to an imposing total of 277 for four. It was a record fourth successive century opening stand by the pair in the series, following partnerships of 115, 142 and 134. Indian openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virendar Sehwag have twice posted back-to-back century opening stands, against England in India in 2001 and against Australia and New Zealand during last months tri-series, also in India. The partnership between Farhat and Hameed was Pakistans best against New Zealand, beating the 194 scored by Saeed Anwar and Wajahatullah Wasti in the 1999 World Cup. It was also the best opening stand by any team against New Zealand in limited-overs cricket. Farhat, 21, took just 51 balls to reach his half century, hitting nine crisp boundaries. Hameed, 25, brought up his fifty off 76 balls with a midwicket boundary. Farhat was the first to reach three figures  his maiden one-day hundred  in the 39th over sent down by Chris Cairns, while Hameed brought up his second century in the 45th over. Farhats century featured 12 fours and a six. Hameeds runs came from 154 balls, with nine fours and one six. The 21-year-old Farhat, since returning to the Pakistan team after a year on the sidelines, has figured in seven century opening stands in his last nine innings in Tests and one-dayers. New Zealand picked up three wickets in the last ten overs as Pakistan juggled with their batting order. Tama Canning, in his third one-dayer, was the most successful bowler with two for 59 off 10 overs. Although Hamish Marshall scored his third half century of the series (62 not out), the Black Caps were never able to chase the target once openers Craig Cumming and Richard Jones struggled to bring up 50 in the first 15 overs. Three unnecessary run outs in the innings did not help their cause, either. By the time captain Chris Cairns came out to bat in the 36th over his team were struggling on 141 for three and in the last 10 overs they required 118 for an unlikely win. Marshall and Tama Canning (23 not out) restored some pride by adding 49 undefeated runs in the last seven overs.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

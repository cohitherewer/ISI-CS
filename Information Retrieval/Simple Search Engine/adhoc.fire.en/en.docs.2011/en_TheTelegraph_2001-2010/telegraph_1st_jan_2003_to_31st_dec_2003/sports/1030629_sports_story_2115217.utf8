The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Badani hits 133
London, June 28 (PTI): Hemang Badani followed in the footsteps of his captain Shiv Sundar Das, hitting a brilliant century as India A declared their first innings at 482 for nine on the second day of the four-day cricket match against Durham at the Riverside Stadium in Chester-le-Street today. Badani scored 133. Resuming at his overnight score of 43, Badani came up with an authoritative display of strokeplay, smashing 15 fours and two sixes in his nearly five-hour knock. Left-arm spinner Murali Kartik made a valuable 50-run contribution while A. T. Rayudu made 25. In reply, Durham were 94 for one in 36 overs at close.  Copyright

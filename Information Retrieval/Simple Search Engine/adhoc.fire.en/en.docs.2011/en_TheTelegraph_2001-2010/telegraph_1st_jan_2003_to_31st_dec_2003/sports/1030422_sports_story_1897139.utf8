 Gough takes six in Yorks innings win
London: Darren Gough staked a claim for his old England place on Sunday as Yorkshire crushed Northamptonshire by an innings with a day to spare in the County Championship. The England bowler had been sidelined since July with a knee injury, but finished with match figures of six for 81 as Yorkshire stormed to an innings and 343-run win at Headingley. It was a big test for me and Im really pleased with the way it went. Gough said on his return. Thats as well as I can bowl. And the pace bowler hinted at an England comeback. If I keep bowling like that, Im sure theyll pick me, Gough added. At The Oval, Ian Ward hit an unbeaten 40 off as many balls as champions Surrey finished on 61 for two in their second innings after being asked to follow-on by Lancashire.

At Derby, Matthew Maynard struck 142 for Glamorgan, helping the Welsh side to 352 all out against Derbyshire. The home side followed their first innings total of 420 with 189 for five at close. England spinner Ashley Giles played a captains innings of 94 before taking the vital wicket of Usman Afzaal as Warwickshire kept their hopes alive of beating Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. Nottinghamshire were 122 for three at stumps, chasing a target of 264 to win. At New Road, South African Nic Pothas hit 146 as Hampshire reached 347 all out against Worcestershire, who in turn reached 187 for five at close.  (AFP)  Copyright

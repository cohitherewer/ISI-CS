 Steve hit by errant throw
Melbourne: Steve Waugh had a nasty scare when he was struck in the temple region by an errant throw while fielding for New South Wales in a Pura Cup match here Friday. Waugh, fielding in the covers, was struck flush by a wayward Stuart Clark throw. He left the Melbourne Cricket Ground immediately and was taken to hospital for a precautionary scan. Team physio Pat Farhart said later that Waugh underwent several scans which confirmed there were no fractures. The scans also determined there was no bleeding of the brain. (AFP)  Copyright

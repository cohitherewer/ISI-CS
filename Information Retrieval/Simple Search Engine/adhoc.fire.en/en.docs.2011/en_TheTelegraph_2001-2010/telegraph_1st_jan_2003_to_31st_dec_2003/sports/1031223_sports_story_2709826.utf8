The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Moin guides Pakistan to respectability
 - Wicketkeeper, Sami figure in 152-run stand for seventh wicket - Tuffey scalps  five for 87  Daryl Tuffey in action against Pakistan in Hamilton on Monday. (Reuters) Hamilton: Moin Khan defied the heroics of New Zealand fast bowler Daryl Tuffey as he steered Pakistan to safety on a rain-shortened fourth day of the first Test on Monday. A draw seemed almost inevitable after Pakistan were all out for 463, 100 runs behind New Zealand, with only a day to play on a placid pitch. The Black Caps felt they were in with a chance when Tuffey snapped up two wickets with the second new ball after lunch to reduce the tourists to 285 for six and needing a further 79 runs to avoid the follow-on. Inzamam ul Haq was back in the pavilion for 51 and Abdul Razzaq out for 48. But enter Moin the saviour with an able lieutenant in Mohammed Sami. The pair put on 152 for the seventh wicket and effectively saved Pakistan. Sami contributed just 25 runs with the bat, but most importantly he directed as much of the strike as possible to the experienced Moin who had no difficulty against a bowling line-up that was often astray on a batting-friendly wicket. He worked the ball around with no sign of panic apart from one anxious moment after some sharp fielding by Chris Cairns led to an apparent run-out. But a detailed video analysis ruled in his favour when it was unclear whether Daniel Vettori had dislodged the bails with the ball in his hand. Moins long stint at the crease eventually came to an end when he was trapped leg-before by Jacob Oram, but by then he had ensured New Zealand would have to bat again. The Pakistan tail folded quickly with the last four wickets falling in the space of 26 runs but the damage had been done. New Zealand were required to bat for two overs before stumps with a four from Mark Richardson the only scoring shot to increase their lead to 104. The Black Caps made the worst possible start to the day when Lou Vincent put down a regulation slip-catch after Inzamam edged the first ball he received from Cairns. It was a 29-run wait before the Pakistan skipper was eventually out, trapped leg-before by New Zealands standout bowler Tuffey. He ended the innings with five for 87 from 33 overs, his second such achievement in Test cricket, and his victims were all in the top order. Ian Butler proved very expensive, giving up 113 runs from his 24 overs, while taking the last two wickets to fall to extract a small element of credibility from his performance. Oram with two for 55 and Vettori with one for 117 were New Zealands other wicket takers. After losing three hours play on Sunday, another two hours were lost on Monday because of the rain and the time needed for the outfield to dry. I was out of the game for so long I was really looking forward to a big innings and it was important today, said Moin, whose last Test hundred was in 1996 against England at Headingley.

 Whatmore not scared to face Australia
 Whatmore happy with Bangladesh progress Dhaka: Bangladeshs new cricket coach, Dav Whatmore, is not afraid of facing Australia, even if the Test minnows come against the full might of the games No. 1 team. Scared? No! Why should I be? I am glad to hear that they will field their full team  the attitude is very good, Whatmore, a Sri Lankan born Australian, said during a training session in Dhaka on Tuesday. Whatmore said it would be a good test for the Bangladeshis  who have never won a Test match  to face Australias best. Whatmore, who guided Sri Lanka to the World Cup championship in 1996, took over as Bangladesh coach last month after Bangladeshs dismal World Cup performance in southern Africa in March. Things are going well. Technique is improving. I am happy with the whole process, Whatmore said. Bangladesh will play two Tests and three limited-overs Internationals during their maiden tour of Australia from July 6 to August 7. Captained by allrounder Khaled Mahmud, the Bangladesh team will depart for Australia on June 22 to play some practice matches ahead of the Test series. Bangladesh have won neither a Test nor a one-day International since gaining Test status in 2000.  (AP)  Copyright

 Indian Oil win first leg 
Mumbai: Mercurial centre-forward Prabhjot Singhs fifth-minute strike helped Indian Oil derail Western Railway in the first of the two-legged semi-final of the 41st Bombay Gold Cup hockey tournament at the Mahindra Stadium Friday. Prabhjot gave Indian Oil the lead when he flicked home a fine cross from his skipper Deepak Thakur. In the second half, the railwaymen got a couple of gilt-edged chances, which went abegging.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Probe into GCCs poor marketing 
New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to appoint an agency to investigate the reasons behind the poor marketing of the World Cup by the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), rights holders of all ICC events till 2007. The decision was taken on the first day of the two-day working committee meeting of the BCCI Wednesday. We felt Nimbus, GCCs agent in India, had done a poor marketing of the World Cup. We have decided to appoint an agency to investigate as to why it was done so poorly, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said. [That the BCCI is poised to challenge the poor marketing by the GCC was first reported by The Telegraph on June 22]. GCC was awarded the marketing rights though its bid was $116 million less than its rival. There are still two Champions Trophies and one World Cup left with the GCC and we want a permanent solution to this, he added. Dalmiyas tirade against the GCC comes in the wake of IDI Limiteds (the business arm of the ICC) decision to withhold the entire guarantee money of India for the World Cup. Dalmiya, however, clarified that the money withheld by ICC was $6.5 million and not $9 million and the BCCI intends to settle the issue through negotiations with the world body. New ICC president Ehsan Mani has expressed his desire not to drag the contracts issue to court. It can be settled through discussions. There is no need to adopt a confrontational approach, Dalmiya said. The BCCI also formally extended the contracts of national coach John Wright and physiotherapist Andrew Leipus for one year while ratifying the appointment of new trainer Gregory Allen King. We have decided to give Wright an extension till September 2004, Dalmiya, added. He will lead the Indian team at least till the ICC Champions Trophy to be played in England in August-September next year. Bonus for Cup show Meanwhile, the Indian team will receive bonuses worth $2.5 million for reaching the World Cup final. We may have lost the final but the players did the country proud, the president added. We have decided to honour all the 15 members of the squad by giving out bonuses worth $ 2.5 million. The support staff like the coach, physiotherapist and physical trainer will also receive separate bonuses. Talking about the resumption of Indo-Pak cricket ties, Dalmiya said: We have done our homework and ready with our plans. Once the permission from the government comes in writing, we would announce the proposed programme, he said. On the concluding day of the meeting Thursday, the working committee will announce the itinerary for the home Test series against New Zealand later this year and the subsequent triangular one-day series featuring India, Australia and New Zealand.

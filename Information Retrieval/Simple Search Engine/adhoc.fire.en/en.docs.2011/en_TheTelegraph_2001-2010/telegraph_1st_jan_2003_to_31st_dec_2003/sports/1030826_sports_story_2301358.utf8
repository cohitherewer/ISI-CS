The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Davenport wins, Rubin crashes out
New York: Third seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States advanced to the second round of the US Open here Monday with a 6-1, 6-0 victory over Belgiums Els Callens. Davenport needed only 20 minutes to claim the first set and finished off her 80th-ranked rival in 47 minutes to reach a match against either 87th-ranked Czech Daja Bedanova or Italys Maria Elena Camerin. But Davenport was still suffering from the foot injury which forced her to retire during the final of the WTA event at New Haven on Saturday which handed fellow American Jennifer Capriati her first title in over a year. A 1998 US Open title makes Davenport the only former champion of this event entered this season and she arrived at Flushing Meadows with severe nerve pain in her left foot. She took a cortizone injection Saturday to ease the ache. It doesnt feel 100 percent all the time, Davenport said. Hopefully it will stay subsided for the next two weeks. Eighth seed Chanda Rubin suffered a 72-minute US Open ordeal, crumbling in the first round to lose 4-6, 4-6 to Venezuelan Maria Vento-Kabchi. The American made 46 unforced errors as she struggled to keep the ball in the Arthur Ashe showcourt on a steamy New York morning. Ninth seed Sebastian Grosjean of France lost to Paraguays Ramon Delgado 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 6-7 (7-9), 4-6. Vento-Kabchi, ranked a lowly 84th in the world, simply kept the ball in court as Rubin all but beat herself. It was just a really bad day for me, Rubin said. I just didnt play with enough glue, with enough consistency. I really didnt concentrate well enough. She hit a lot of balls, played pretty well that way. I needed to be more aggressive. Overall it was a poor match for me.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

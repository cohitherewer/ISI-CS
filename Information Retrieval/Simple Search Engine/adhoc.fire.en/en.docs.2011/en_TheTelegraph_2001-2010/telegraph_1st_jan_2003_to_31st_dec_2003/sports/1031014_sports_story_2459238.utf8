The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ATP determined to fight corruption
London: The governing body of world tennis, ATP, on Monday vowed to take all possible steps to keep the sport clean amid accusations of match-fixing. Promising to look into all allegations of match-fixing by some of the players, the ATP said the organisation would do everything to protect the sports integrity. Anything suspicious will be looked into. The ATP is taking everything seriously. The integrity of tennis is paramount, ATP spokesman Nicola Arzani said. The ATP is aware that gambling scandals have battered the image of other sports, including cricket, and a system of penalties has already been put in place. Any player found guilty of match-fixing would be banned for three years and fined $100,000. Gambling has affected other sports, he said. There are rules in place in tennis. A three-year ban would effectively mean the end of someones career and the feeling of the players is that they would never forgive anyone who cheats. Arzani said ATP had entered into a letter of understanding with Betfair  the internet betting company at the centre of claims, to look into the allegations. The ATP first learned of concerns about betting more than three months ago which prompted it to sign the agreement with the company. A report in the Sunday Telegraph alleged that fixes came to light when bookmakers discovered that some matches were attracting a far greater betting turnover than they should have. (AFP)  Copyright

 Shetty, Mishra stun GMs 
 Nisha holds eighth seed Alexander Gominyh New Delhi, Oct. 4 (PTI): Indias Rahul Shetty and N.K. Mishra stunned two foreign Grandmasters to emerge joint leaders at the end of the fourth round of the Parsvnath international chess meet on Saturday. IM Shetty shocked ninth seed Sergei Ovestivitij of Ukraine while IM Mishra got the better of tenth seed Marat Dhzumaev of Uzbekistan to book their place in the five-member all Indian-leading pack. Youngest Commonwealth champion GM P. Harikrishna, IM R.B. Ramesh and 13-year-old Abhijeet Gupta joined the duo in lead (with four points each) winning their respective encounters. On the top boards, Harikrishna defeated V. Sarvanan while Ramesh beat Anup Deshmukh. Top seed GM Dmitry Svetushkin of Moldova defeated Akshay Raj Kore while GM Abhijeet Kunte (3.5) beat Sonak Palit to remain in the joint second spot with 14 others in the tournament, with seven more rounds to go. Meanwhile, GM Koneru Humpy garnered full points by defeating Abhishek Das to remain just one point adrift from the leaders. In other matches, WGM Nisha Mohota played a draw with eighth seed Alexander Gominyh of Russia while GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly defeated P.D.S. Girinath. Calcuttas Atanu Lahiri (3) forced a draw with Uzbekistans Tahir Vakhidov while Arghyadip Das (2.5) lost Sriram Jha. Sayantan Dutta (3) drew with S. Kidambi but Syed Anwar Shazuli got the better of Subhrajit Saha (2.5). Shetty employed the Slav defence against his Ukranian opponent to garner full points from 36 moves while Mishra chose the Dutch defence to emerge victorious in the same number of moves. Meanwhile, Gupta foxed the experienced Lanka Ravi with an unorthodox Trompovsky attack to maintain his cent per cent win record. Ravi, a GM-norm holder, was caught unawares by the kid from Rajashtan as he resigned after 43 moves.  Copyright

 Jayasuriya formally resigns
Colombo: A day after announcing his decision to quit captaincy, Sanath Jayasuriya Friday formally tendered his resignation to Sri Lankan cricket board chief Anura Tennekoon. Tennekoon said he had informed the selection committee chairman about the resignation letter he received from Jayasuriya and the national selectors would take the final decision on the matter next week. He handed over a letter to me this morning and I have informed the chairman of selectors, Tennekoon said. The selectors will have to make the decision as to whether to accept his resignation, Tennekoon was quoted as saying on a website. With two selectors currently out of the country, the five-man panel is expected to discuss the captaincy issue after the Sinhalese New Year next week. The committee, headed by former Sri Lanka leg-spinner Lalith Kaluperuma, will have to decide first whether to accept Jayasuriyas resignation and then who should take over. Though Jayasuriya had expressed his intention to step down from the post soon after the World Cup, he was persuaded by the countrys sports minister to stay till the completion of the four-nation Sharjah Cup. I was asked to continue for Sharjah. Now they will have to find someone else to do the job, Jayasuriya said. According to sources, Jayasuriyas deputy Maravan Atapattu is being considered for the post though off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan said he would take on the mantle of captaincy if he is asked to do so. I am not interested in it. If nobody else takes it, then I have no problem in becoming the captain.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Reid ready to coach Indian bowlers
Brisbane: Former Australian speedster Bruce Reid, who is tipped to take over as the bowling coach of the Indian cricket team during the series Down Under, Friday said that he is ready to join the visitors to make their five-pronged pace attack more potent. If all goes to plan, Reid, a former Australian left-arm paceman should be available before the first Test in Brisbane December 4. Reid confirmed Indian coach John Wright spoke to him more than once on the issue and he is now waiting for the Indian board to clear his appointment at its working committee meeting in New Delhi Sunday. John (Wright) has spoken to me thrice on the possibility of me joining as a bowling coach, Reid said over phone from Perth. I am waiting for things to clear up to join the squad. I have told John as soon as I get the green signal, I will fly over from Perth to join the boys. Indian team management sources revealed Reid has asked for extremely low fees. The bowler has quoted a fee of $ 1,500 per week which is on the lower side by international standards. You cant get a lower fee quoted than what Reid has asked for, said a member of the Indian team management. (PTI)  Copyright

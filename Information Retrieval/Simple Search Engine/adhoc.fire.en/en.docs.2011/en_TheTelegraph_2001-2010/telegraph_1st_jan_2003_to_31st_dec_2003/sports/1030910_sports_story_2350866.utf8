 CPTs state cagers sit and watch
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) have a tradition for producing talented sportspersons. And they are known to take good care of them too. But the cagers of the office team present a different view. There are five Bengal players in our ranks (Suhas Bhattacharya, Robin Mondal, Sujoy Mondal, Amar Swarnakar and Surojit Dey). None of us has played any tournament during the last seven months, one of the quintet said. The office league-cum-knockout, the Barisha invitation meet and the Chhatra Samity invitation tournament have come and gone by while CPT have sat idle. We are the defending champions of the office league. Also, with the state championships coming up, we desperately needed some match practice. But strangely, our authorities have decided to stay away from all the tournaments, alleged the player who had come to see the final of the Chhatra Samity-organised senior invitation meet. He added its more frustrating because they had swept everything last season. And the teams which are playing here lost badly to us in most of the tournaments, he said. CPT sports officer Shibaji Banerjee was in no mood to sympathise with the cagers. When told about players charge, he said: Tell them to do their duty properly. They cant get away without doing their official duties. Banerjee added the manager of the basketball team, Tushar Purakayasthya, had told him theres no need to take part in these sub-standard tournaments. Well play the state championships, thats all, Banerjee signed off.  Copyright

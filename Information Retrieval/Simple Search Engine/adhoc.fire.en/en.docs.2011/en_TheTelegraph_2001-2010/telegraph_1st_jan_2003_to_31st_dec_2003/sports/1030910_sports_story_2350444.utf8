 Burdwan boys win thrilling final
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rakhi Sangha girls  (top) and Burdwan boys after winning the finals in the  state youth basketball meet on the Chhatra Samity courts  on Tuesday. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: An outstanding effort by Zaffar Hussain went in vain as Chetla Park went down 43-44 to Burdwan District in the boys final of the state youth championship organised by the 1923 Chhatra Samity. Rakhi Sangha had it easy in the girls final, thrashing Birbhum District 38-8. The boys final was a pulsating affair with the lead changing hands every quarter. Burdwan boys built up a 17-4 advantage in the first quarter before Hussains skills helped Chetla Park turn things around. The city team went 26-23 up in the second and extended it to 35-29, going into the fourth. But the Burdwan boys, spearheaded by Raju Majhi (18 points), regained control in the last quarter. Their cause was helped by a sudden dip in accuracy of the Chetla boys, who missed a number of sitters. Hussain (27 points) still tried his hardest, making it 43-41 for his team with a three-pointer. There was just a minute to go for the final whistle, but that was enough for Burdwan to snatch the title.  They got three free shots and Majhi showed steely nerves to put the ball in on all three occasions. It won Majhi the Man-of-the-Match award, though no one deserved it more than Hussain. He had to be content with the highest scorer award. Rakhi Sangha girls were on song from the word go, making it 14-4 in the first quarter. They piled on the pressure and the hapless Birbhum girls failed to earn a single point in the second and third quarters. The district team did manage to put up a fight in the last quarter, but the match had already been lost by then. Pallabi Dutta (19 points) of Rakhi Sangha walked away with the highest scorer and best player awards. Priyanka Kumari (10 points) also did a good job for the winners. BTA won the senior all-Bengal invitational meet edging out Eastern Railway SC 51-49 in the final. Amalendu Singh of BTA was the highest scorer of the match with 18 points. RESULTS (All finals) Boys: Burdwan District bt Chetla Park 44-43. Girls: Rakhi Sangha bt Birbhum District 38-8. Senior all-Bengal invitational meet: BTA bt Eastern Railway SC 51-49.  Copyright

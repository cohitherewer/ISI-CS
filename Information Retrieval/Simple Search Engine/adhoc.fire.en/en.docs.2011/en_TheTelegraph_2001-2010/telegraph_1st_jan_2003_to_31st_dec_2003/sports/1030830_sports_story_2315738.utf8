Rafique finished with five  for 118. (Reuters) Peshawar: Bangladeshs Alok Kapali performed a rare hattrick and Mohammed Rafique took five wickets on Friday, but Pakistan once again hit back hard on the third day of their second Test after conceding a 66-run lead. Pakistan, who fell short on a batting belter, were dismissed for 295 in reply to Bangladeshs 361. Speedster Shoaib Akhtar jolted the tourists in the second outing by removing openers Hannan Sarkar for seven and first innings centurion Javed Omar for a duck. By the time stumps were drawn, 2.2 overs earlier due to bad light, Bangladesh lost the prized wicket of Habibul Bashar (28) and Mohammed Ashraful to end the day at 52 for four  an overall lead of 118 runs. Earlier, left-arm spinner Rafique bowled a workmanlike spell of 32 overs and rattled Pakistans top order with figures of five for 118. But leg-spinner Kapali (three for three) stole the show with his extraordinary split hattrick in the last session. He had number nine batsman Shabbir Ahmed caught at mid-off and ended his over by trapping Danish Kaneria leg before. Last man Umer Gul could not take his pad out of the line of stumps and was out plumb leg before off Kapalis first ball in the next over. Kapali became the 29th bowler to achieve this feat in Test history. This left Youhana stranded on a fine 64, which included 10 fours and a six. Rafiques double strike earlier in the first session put Pakistan on the defensive. In an extended session of two-and-a-half hours because of Friday prayers, Pakistan moved to 222 for four from the overnight 134 for two. They lost the key wickets of Taufeeq Umer and Inzamam-Ul Haq to Rafique. Umer added another 15 to his overnight 60 before he got a faint edge to Rafique and was neatly caught by wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud. Umer added 75 runs for the third wicket with Inzamam in two hours. Inzamam, recalled for the series after a dreadful World Cup, lofted Rafique for a big six over long off and scored six boundaries in his 43-run knock. However, he needlessly tried to cut a straight delivery and was clean bowled. Pakistan skipper Rashid Latif dominated the 64-run fourth wicket stand with Youhana and scored 40 but was lured by Rafique to come out of his crease and was stumped. Shoaib Malik, who has been ruled out from bowling after sustaining a groin and calf injury on the first day, spent a painful half an hour at the wicket before he fell to Rafique for a 19-ball duck. Youhana brought up his half century with two successive boundaries off Rafique on the off side but Kapalis late heroics gave Bangladesh a first innings lead for the first time in its 23 Test matches. Shoaib to rejoin Meanwhile, Akhtar will, after all, rejoin English county side Durham after the second Test against Bangladesh. Pakistan had second thoughts about releasing the fast bowler after Mohammed Sami was ruled out of the ongoing test series against Bangladesh with a hairline fracture of the ankle. But Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia said on Friday: Akhtar will join the English county soon after the second Test. (AP)  Copyright

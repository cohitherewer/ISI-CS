The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Smith doubtful starter 
- South Africa skipper says team learned from England loss England skipper Michael Vaughan during training at Old Trafford Wednesday. (Reuters)  Manchester: South Africa captain Graeme Smith could miss Thursdays tri-series match against England at Old Trafford with a shoulder injury. The 22-year-old fell awkwardly on his left shoulder while trying to take a catch running back in South Africas 46-run win over Zimbabwe at Canterbury on Sunday. He took no part in training at Old Trafford on Wednesday and a decision on the left-handed opening batsmans fitness for the day/night encounter will be delayed until Thursday morning. Smith said on Wednesday: I am carrying a bit of a shoulder injury. I am optimistic about playing but I dont know if the physio is. It (the injury) has definitely come on a lot since Monday. If I do play, Ill be playing in pain, but Im ready to give 100 per cent. Id like to play every game but it is a long tour, added Smith ahead of South Africas five Test series against England. The good thing with the shoulder injury is there is not much more damage that can be done. South Africa went down by six-wickets in their opening tri-series match against England at The Oval on Saturday. And they are now three points behind both England and Zimbabwe in the table after their rivals match at Headingley on Tuesday was washed out and declared a no-result, the teams sharing three points each. But Smith insisted he attached no greater importance to Thursdays match than any other. Every game is a big game for us. He also said his team had learnt lessons from their defeat to England where they were on the receiving end of a blistering assault by openers Marcus Trescothick (114 not out) and Vikram Solanki (106). We didnt get our bowling disciplines right. Credit to them, they really played well. But everything they did came off for them. On another day they might have given a catch. Maybe our guys felt a little bit of pressure, with a big crowd and it being the first game against England. There were a lot of nerves. But after the first 15 overs against Zimbabwe our bowling and fielding started to come good. South Africa have called up fast-medium bowler Andre Nel into their squad. Nel, 26 later this month, had been playing for Northamptonshire. But he will be unavailable for Thursdays match because that fixture will see him complete a six-game ban imposed after he was arrested on a drink-driving charge in Tasmania in April during a South Africa A tour of Australia.

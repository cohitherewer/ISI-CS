		 Monday, January 20, 2003 				 Border slams poor pitches
																								Sydney: Australian cricket legend Allan Border Sunday condemned the poor quality of first-class pitches in the country as a threat to Australias position as the games world leader.																								Border expressed concern at the spate of dodgy wickets prepared this summer for the Sheffield Shield competition. He warned that if the trend to green tops and huge first-day wicket hauls continued, batsmen would not develop. 																								Its a worrying trend for me, said Border. Id like to see the wickets prepared a little bit better... I dont want us to go down the England road where you play on result wickets for the sake of getting a result. (AFP)

 Sri Lanka invite India
Colombo: The BCCSL has invited India to join a series in November to turn the tournament into a three-nation event, chief executive Anura Tennekoon said Friday. England is due in Sri Lanka in November for three Tests and three ODIs but the Lankan Board also wants India for the limited-overs segment. If India decides to make the tour, they will have to adjust dates of the home series against New Zealand and the tri-series also involving Australia. Earlier this month, the BCCSL said it would amend the schedule for Englands tour. (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan officials run riot at press meet
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Some things never change in the Anjan Mitra-led administration of Mohun Bagan. Ever since the club was stripped by the high court of the power of overseeing the clubs football affairs, they have put up one excuse after another to cover up their mistakes and playing a blame-game on the media has been a common feature. On Wednesday, the ugly face came to the fore yet again when Mitras men manhandled journalists, bringing disrepute to the century-old club. Mitra, who is the club secretary, called a press conference at Calcutta Sports Journalists Club (CSJC) to speak about the allegations levelled against him by the current football administration. The principal charge against him is related to the subject of withholding payment of footballers. Mitra came to the CSJC armed with more than 100 club members and officials. Whenever any controversial question came up, Mitra either bypassed it or passed the buck. One such question led his men, who totally outnumbered 30-odd scribes present on the occasion, to charge towards the journalists. They used abusive words and some even rampaged through chairs, allotted for the scribes. The club officials, including Mitra, remained silent, allowing their members to run riot inside the CSJC tent for about 20 minutes. Mitra later apologised. Im sorry for what has happened here. As you have seen, they didnt listen to my pleas, the official said. When asked why he had come with so many people at a press conference, he reasoned they had turned up out of their love for the club! During the press meet, Mitra only wanted to present his facts and figures, and as usual, a large part of his accusation was hurled against the current officials running football matters. He insisted Jose Ramirez Barreto was paid Rs 4 lakh in the 2003-2004 season, but turned back completely when asked about the Brazilians letter to club assistant secretary denying receiving any such money. Mitra, however, maintained he would go by the decision of the UB Group, sponsorers of the club, about releasing money with regard to players payments. The official, however, claimed the Isa Musah case would have been handled more efficiently had he been given the charge. Fifa barred the club from recruiting foreigners untill payment to Musah was released within a certain period of time.  Copyright

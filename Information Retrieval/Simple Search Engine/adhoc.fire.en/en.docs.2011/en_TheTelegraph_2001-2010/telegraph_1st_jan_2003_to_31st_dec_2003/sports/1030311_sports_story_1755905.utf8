The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another crown for Leander
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Leander Paes won his second title in two weeks when he and Nenad Zimonjic clinched the Delray Beach doubles crown Sunday. According to information received here, the Indo-Czech pair overcame Dutchmen Ramon Sluiter and Martin Verkerk 7-5, 3-6, 7-5 in the final. Paes, who bagged the Dubai Open trophy with regular partner David Rikl last week, thus caught up with Mahesh Bhupathis 26 career doubles crowns. Bhupathi, whose partnership with Joshua Eagle has failed to take off this year, suffered another first-round defeat in Delray Beach.  Copyright

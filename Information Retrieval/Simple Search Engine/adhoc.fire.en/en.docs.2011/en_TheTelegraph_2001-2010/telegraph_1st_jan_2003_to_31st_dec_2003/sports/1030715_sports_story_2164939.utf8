 Chetram Singh withdraws
Bridgetown: Chetram Singh withdrew as the sole candidate for the presidential elections of the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB). The reason  ownership of a gambling business in Guyana would have disqualified him from holding a position on the ICC. The 53-year-old Singh, president of the Guyana Cricket Board, announced his decision on Sunday at the WICBs annual meeting in Roseau, Dominica. I believe that West Indies cricket needs continued unity at this time and I would not wish to accept the post of president without the broad-based support of the board and the cricket-loving people of the Caribbean, he said. The cricket board has opened nominations to its six- member boards, including Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, the Leeward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands. The WICB said it would call a special meeting to elect a replacement for Wes hall who resigned at the meeting in Dominica. Hall has cited unspecified health problems, which inhibit his ability to travel. Cricket officials have not set a date for the special meeting. Val banks, the Anguillan banker who was re-elected vice president at the meeting over the only other candidate, will act as interim president. (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Meets to be staged from August
Singapore: Southeast Asias three Grand Prix badminton tournaments, due to have been held in June and early July and originally postponed due to the SARS crisis, will be played in August, the International Badminton Federation (IBF) said on Wednesday. The International Badminton Federation is pleased to announce the rescheduling of the Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia Open world Grand Prix events, the IBF said. The decision to put the events back on the calendar came after the world championships, originally set for May 12-18 in Birmingham, were also rescheduled for July 26 to August 3, as the SARS crisis eased. The IBF said the three back-to-back tournaments, which carry world ranking points and Olympic qualifying points, will start in Singapore during the week beginning August 18, move to Indonesia and end in Malaysia. The three meets boast a total prize money of $460,000.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Title for Mahesh-Max 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Second seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi lifted the Madrid Masters Series doubles title on Sunday. Bhupathi and Mirnyi beat Zimbabweans Wayne Black and Kevin Ullyett 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 in the final, according to information received here. This is Bhupathis 32nd career doubles crown and sixth with Mirnyi, of which five have come this year. It took the Indo-Belarussian pairs tally to 878 points and put them second on the doubles team list  24 adrift of American twins Bob and Mike Bryan. In Saturdays semi-final, Bhupathi and Mirnyi had battled past Albert Costa and Martin Verkerk 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-2. With the Indian opting out of the Paris Masters to take part in the Afro-Asian Games, Bhupathi and Mirnyi  who lost in the final of the Vienna meet last week  now have two tournaments (St Petersburg and Houston) to capture the much-coveted year-end No. 1 rank.

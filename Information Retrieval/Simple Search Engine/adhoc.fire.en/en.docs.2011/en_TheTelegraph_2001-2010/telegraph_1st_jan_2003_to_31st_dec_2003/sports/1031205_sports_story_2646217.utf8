 Sheikh may be Leeds rescuer
Dubai: Sheikh Abdul Rahman bin Mubarak Al-Khalifa might not be a household name for soccer fans but he could rescue Leeds United from extinction. The club, with 78 million in debts, is on the brink of becoming the first Premier League outfit to go into administration. Sheikh Abdul Rahman, who used to go to Elland Road to watch Leeds matches when he was a student in Yorkshire in the 1970s, is trying to broker a deal with a Middle East consortium to save the club.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sonn set to be Manis successor
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Percy Sonn Mumbai, Sept. 20: Barring the unexpected, South Africas Percy Sonn will succeed Ehsan Mani as the Internatonal Cricket Council (ICC) president in June 2005. The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) has until next March to forward its nominee, but the process should be completed in the next two months itself. Earlier this year, the ICC confirmed that Manis successor will be from South Africa. As with the current president, Sonn will have a two-year term. According to UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola, Sonns has been the only nomination from the 11 provinces affiliated to the national body. Now, the officebearers will interview him and, then, revert to the full Board with their observations, he told The Telegraph this evening. Sonn, it may be recalled, recently relinquished the UCBSA presidency to set in motion his move towards the No.1 post on the administrative side in cricket. Besides Sonns successor Ray Mali, vice-president Rob Kurz, treasurer John Blair and Majola will sit on the interview-board. We should be through with our work before November 19, when the full Board meets again, Majola added.  Copyright

 Mouma, Kamal emerge winners 
New Delhi: A. Sharath Kamal and Mouma Das  both from PSPB  warmed up their preparation for the nationals in style, winning the mens and womens titles respectively, in the national ranking table tennis championship (north zone) on Wednesday. Top seed Kamal defeated teammate and second seed Soumyadeep Roy 6-11, 11-7, 11-9, 1-11, 11-7, 11-3 while third seed Mouma thrashed Anindita Chakraborty of RSPB 11-8, 11-7, 11-6, 11-9. Kamal, who now heads for the national championship to be held at Manesar, Haryana as a hot favourite after winning his third title this year, required just 33 minutes to overcome Soumyadeep. In the semi-finals, Kamal had earlier accounted for fifth seed Arup Basak of PSPB 5-11, 11-7, 8-11, 11-8, 11-8, 11-9 while Soumyadeep got the better of Anirban Nandy of RSPB 5-11, 11-9, 11-3, 9-11, 11-5, 11-6. In the womens section, Mouma ensured that PSPBs dominance was not hampered by the loss of top-seed Poulami Ghatak. Anindita, who had accounted for the top seed in the quarter finals, came a cropper against Mouma going down in straight games.  (PTI)  Copyright

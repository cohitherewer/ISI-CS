The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hants in talks with Akram 
Johannesburg: Wasim Akram has been approached by English County Hampshire to replace Australias banned spinner Shane Warne for next season, sources said on Monday. Warne, who played for Hampshire in 2000 and had signed another two-year contract, was banned from all cricket by the Australian Cricket Board on Saturday after testing positive for a banned diuretic. Wasim, who played for Lancashire for 10 years, is expected to confirm whether hell turn out for the new County later this week.  (AFP)  Copyright

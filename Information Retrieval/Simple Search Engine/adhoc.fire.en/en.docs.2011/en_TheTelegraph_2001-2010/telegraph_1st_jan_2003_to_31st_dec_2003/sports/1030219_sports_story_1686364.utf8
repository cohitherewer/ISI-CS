The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I played a part in carrying our cricket to multi-million dollar business: Andy Flower
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Andy Flower: Time to move on Harare: Its unlikely that Zimbabwe will, in the immediate future at least, find a replacement for Andy Flower. Yet, the countrys No.1 cricketer is quitting after the World Cup. He is signing off on a controversial note (black armband and all), but that shouldnt detract from his enormous contribution to Zimbabwe cricket. Though Andy declined to answer questions related to his and Henry Olongas extraordinary protest, in the match against Namibia, he didnt duck other queries. In fact, Andy spoke to The Telegraph for around half-an-hour at the Harare Sports Club, late on Monday, after an extended workout and a one-to-one with Olonga. The following are excerpts: On plans after quitting international cricket Ill be back at Essex and, then, take it up from there... Its very sad I wont again be playing for Zimbabwe, but that was a decision I had to make. Ive got to move on now... South Australia? Whether or not Ill play for them is something I wont talk about right now. On the reasons for deciding to quit (After a pause) Some are a little touchy and, so, I wouldnt like to go on record... But, yes, financial considerations have played a part as also family reasons. Over the years, there have been a lot of distractions in Zimbabwe and, last year, it was nice going over to Essex and just enjoying the game... On 11 years of international cricket (Smiles) I havent had the chance to look back... Reflecting at the top of my head, its been an amazing period and Ive played a part in carrying Zimbabwe cricket from small beginnings to a multi-million dollar business  probably the most successful in the country. In fact, cricket is a successful sport as well. I accept we arent one of the best sides in the world, but can still hold our heads high. Speaking purely personally, I never quite expected to do the things Ive actually done... I always wanted to travel the world and cricket gave me the opportunity. Ive been a lucky guy. On having quit the captaincy some years ago Id stopped enjoying the job... That the team wasnt doing well was definitely a factor. Also, it wasnt easy getting the guys to train and behave as professionals. That transitional period involving amateurs and pros was tough... At times, it was frustrating as well. Then, I myself made mistakes in man-management. Having matured, Ive no doubt I would have been a better captain in more recent times. (After a pause) Basically, if you arent enjoying the job, you shouldnt be at it. In a team sport, for example, it tends to affect teammates. On the musical chairs over the captaincy In an ideal world, yes, there should be continuity. That there have been so many changes, in recent years, is a pointer that things havent been rosy in Zimbabwe cricket. However, if a captain is chosen wisely and backed by the Establishment, theres no reason why he cant have a reasonable tenure. Of course, Im opposed to anybody having a fixed term. The appointment has to be open-ended. On having had that three-in-one role (captaincy, wicketkeeping and being the No.1 batsman) Did take its toll, specially on my keeping. I found it hard devoting time to that job and couldnt concentrate to the degree I wanted to. On having stopped being the wicketkeeper That was decided by the selectors. Left to me, I would have continued to keep. That decision, though, was out of my hands. On Tatenda Taibu Oh, hes got great attitude and is getting better and better each time. Moreover, his batting has improved tremendously. Today, he isnt an immature batsman but a very well organised one. Hes modest, but doesnt lack confidence. Hes got a great future. On being regarded one of the finest players of spin Ive worked hard right through my career and tried to be smart at everything I did. (After a pause) Generally, cricketers dont devote much time to thinking about the game. Yet, Ive been particular about doing so. I accept Im not among the most physically gifted but, then, guys have to work hard and devise a reasonably low risk method of getting runs. On always being expected to score (Smiles again) Like it or not, cricketers have to deal with pressure, the pressure of expectations. Its a distraction and must be tackled. Personally, I havent made that a big part of my cricket. Indeed, Ive tried to put pressure in perspective  that its not life or death, that failure wont mean the end of the world. If one series isnt good, well, look to the next one... On his fantastic record (Tests and ODIs) against India Ive believed in a simple philosophy: When the going is good, make the most of it. On his prescription for Zimbabwean cricket Weve already taken a few good steps... Weve got an academy in place, weve got a top coach (Geoff Marsh) and assistant coach (Kevin Curran) and, in Vince Hogg, weve got a good chief executive... So, positives exist... What weve got to do is strengthen our base, which is domestic cricket, and ensure that the academy staff is the best we can afford... The A team too must have a top coach. Also, down the line, the right disciplines must be followed. On what cricket has taught him (Laughs) Straight up, thats a big question... It has taught me humility... Ive learnt by watching somebody like Sachin Tendulkar... The way he has kept his humility is amazing...Then, during the years of travel, Ive been reminded of the importance of being down to earth... Weve been exposed to five-star hotels, but have also encountered crippled beggars... Thats been a different experience. Strictly cricket-wise, I learnt to work through the hard times... The years of cricket also made me appreciate camaraderie... Ive learnt not to be too smart or cocky when on a high and, equally, not get devastated when the ride isnt good. On whether he admires/envies any cricketer(s) Admire a lot of them... The hugely naturally gifted ones like Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Wasim Akram and Shane Warne... Then, the ones who have worked so hard to have that discipline in their game  Steve Waugh, Glenn McGrath... My brother (Grant) as well. Finally, on Zimbabwes chances in the World Cup If we beat India, we should make it to the Super Six. Once there, anything can happen.  Copyright

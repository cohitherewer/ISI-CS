		 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 Sasikiran slips out of top 30
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Krishnan Sasikiran has slipped out of the top 30 in the latest world chess rankings list released this month. The Chennai-based GM had become the first Indian after Viswanathan Anand to break into the elite group in the previous list published in October.																								According to the new list, Saikirans Elo rating is still a very formidable 2664, but he has lost six points to come down to 32nd in the world from 26th. Anand stays third behind Garri Kasparov (2847) and Vladimir Kramnik (2807) with 2753, despite losing two points.																								Hungarian Judit Polgar has become the first woman ever to reach the 2700 mark and she is ranked 13th in the world. Indias Koneru Humpy has gained 12 points to move to 2496. She is placed fifth in the womens ranking list. WGM S. Vijayalakshmi is 37th with 2416.																								Among other Indians, Surya Sekhar Gangulys steady climb continues, and he has gained a smart 25 points to advance to 2556. The GM is ranked third among Indian men.																								Bengals Sandipan Chanda has had to pay dearly for a dismal outing in Decembers world junior championship held in Goa and he has lost a whopping 46 points to slip back to 2464.																								This means that Chanda, who has two GM norms under his belt, will have to start afresh and push his rating back above 2500 and clinch the third norm to pocket the coveted title.																								TOP TEN INDIANS																								1. Viswanathan Anand (2753). 2. K. Sasikiran (2664). 3. Surya Sekhar Ganguly (2556). 4. Dibyendu Barua (2541). 5. P. Harikrishna (2539). 6. Abhijit Kunte (2507). 7. Koneru Humpy (2496). 8. R.B. Ramesh (2465). 9. Praveen Thipsay (2465). 10. Tejas Bakre (2464).

 NZ reach Hyderabad
Hyderabad: New Zealand arrived in the city last night to a traditional welcome. The Black Caps, who lost to Australia in Guwahati, would be playing in the last league match of the tri-series against India here Saturday. The visitors need to win the last match, to be played at the Lal Bahadur Stadium, to bolster their chances of making it to the final. Australia top the points table and have already qualified for the final. India, with nine points, will be playing Australia in Bangalore Wednesday before taking on New Zealand in the last league encounter. New Zealand have ten points with one game to go. (PTI)  Copyright

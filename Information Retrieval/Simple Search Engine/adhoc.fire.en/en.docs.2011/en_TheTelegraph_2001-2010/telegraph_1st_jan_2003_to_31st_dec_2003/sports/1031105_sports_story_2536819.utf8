The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, November 05, 2003  City season from Friday Makybe Diva lifts Melbourne Cup 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 	 Trainer David Hall kisses Makybe Diva after she won the 4.6 million A$ (3.25 million US$) at the Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne on Tuesday. Makybe Diva, who is owned by an Australian tuna fisherman, won the race from Shes Archie and Jardines Outlook. It was the 143rd running of the Melbourne Cup and Makybe Diva became only the 14th mare to win Australias richest and most famous horse race. Ridden perfectly by Glenn Boss, the five-year-old Makybe Diva sprinted clear of the field in the final 200m to win by a length. (AFP) 				 										Calcutta: Although things did not work the desired way, the stewards of the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) has signalled the start of the winter season from Friday. Weather gods have, of course, been kind since November 5, when the season was scheduled to start. However, the start was ruled out when a section of trainers showed reluctance to race on monsoon track. However, it may be too early to rule out the start on the winter track as a shower or two between now and Friday may, again, play the spoilsport.				 										RCTC would have liked to begin the winter season on a weekend and the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC), too, gave hope of such a possibility. However, with the Bangalore owner-trainers and race club fiasco taking a dramatic turn late on Monday night, things were back to square one.

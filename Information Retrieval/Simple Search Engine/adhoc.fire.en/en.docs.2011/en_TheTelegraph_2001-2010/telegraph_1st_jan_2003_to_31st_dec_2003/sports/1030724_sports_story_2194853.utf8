The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Thursday, July 24, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Mohun Bagan finally are paying a little more attention to football problems than to infighting. On Wednesday they acquired a little more stability in the defence as Nigerian Chukwuma Akuneto signed on the dotted line. An addition to the defence has been a long standing demand of Bagan coaches.				 																																																	Also, emulating East Bengals appointment of South African Kevin Jackson as trainer, the faction-ridden Bagan have decided to appoint a Brazilian fitness trainer. The club has no money to pay its players, but believes that it can bear the cost of Robson Matos de Olivera, reportedly associated with seven professional Latin American clubs. Olivera arrives Monday.				 																																																	 Salgaocar of Goa, who arrived in the city Tuesday for the Federation Cup starting Saturday, are pretty much in the dark about the teams they will meet. Coach Savio Medeira said he had no idea on the composition of Indian Bank, who they meet on the opening day. Nor does he have any idea of Mohammedan Sporting or ITI, likely second round rivals.				 																																																	He said Salgaocar have lost eight key players this season (two in each department), but still have in their ranks players like Samson Singh, Agnelo Barreto and Nadendra Metei in attack. 				 																																																	The half line still has Tomba Singh, Climax Lawrence and Jatin Bist. The goalkeepers are Rajat Ghosh Dastidar and Rajat Guha.				 																																																	He said the team will go into the Cup having played no competitive match this season. The Goa league starts only in September.				 																																																	 Two marching orders were issued in Wednesdays fifth division league engagements. Referee Juman Ali Shah threw out Sujit Ghosh of Darjeepara for rough play in their 1-1 draw with Uttarpalli, while Joydeb Das of India Club was marched out by referee Srijit Prodhan in their 1-1 draw with Excelsiors for a rough tackle.				 																																																	 Boys Training Association made the quarter final of the junior boys knockout basketball meet at the WBBA court on Wednesday, beating Anek Gosthi 50-15. Gosthi junior girls, meanwhile, also lost to Dalhousie Institute 7-38 in the league on Wednesday. 				 																																																	FOOTBALL: CFL Super division  Mohammedan AC vs Wari AC (Mohun Bagan), 3.30pm.				 																																																	BASKETBALL: Junior boys knockout  BBYS vs Chetla Park, Barisha AC vs Tarun Bayam Sangha (WBBA courts).

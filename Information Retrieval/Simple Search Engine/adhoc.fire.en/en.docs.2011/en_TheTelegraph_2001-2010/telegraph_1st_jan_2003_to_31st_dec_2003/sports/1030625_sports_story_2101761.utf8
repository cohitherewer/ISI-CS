 Waqar flays Shoaib
 Waqar feels it would have been better for Pak had Shoaib been born an Australian London: Former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis slammed speedster Shoaib Akhtar for talking big and never delivering on the big stage. Waqar, currently playing for Warwickshire, also took strong exception to Shoaibs comment describing him and fellow fast bowler Wasim Akram as declining forces. Waqar, who was sacked as captain and dumped following Pakistans humiliating show in the World Cup, said Shoaib should look at his own disappointing performances instead of talking about others. It is ridiculous Shoaib coming out in the papers saying he is going to do this or do that. He has been doing it for a few years now and he never lives up to it and it looks pretty ugly, Waqar was quoted as saying by The Independent Tuesday. Shoaib spoke about me and Wasim last week saying we lost the World Cup because both of us were on the decline. It was all rubbish, basically, Waqar said. It is no use talking about others on the decline  he should look at his own performance. He performs to his ability once a year  and then he has the nerve to compare himself with Glenn McGrath and players like that. He was saying last week that if had he been born Australian, hed have taken more wickets. It might have been better for Pakistan if he had been born in Australia, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

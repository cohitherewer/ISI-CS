The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. survive close call
 - Dipendu, Sheikh Sanjeeb and Rahim Nabi strike in 3-2 win over Mohammedan AC  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sheikh Sanjeeb congratulates Dipendu Biswas after the first goal at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh  Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting  were on the verge of making a mess of a comfortable three-goal  cushion against Mohammedan AC in the Super Division match  at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. After conceding two goals in a spell of eight minutes, the black-and-white brigade clung on for the last 28 minutes to ensure the 3-2 victory. The win took Mohammedan Sporting to 18 points from eight games while Mohammedan AC stay on 16 from 10. The beginning, however, never suggested things would become so difficult for the Federation Cup finalists. Their midfield worked like a well-oiled machine as Mohammedan Sporting raided the rival territory time and again. Moreover, with hardly any blocking from the opposition in the middle-third, the Mohammedan Sporting attackers reached the penetrative zone quite easily. They were also stretching the rival defence well as balls started floating in from both the flanks. Mohammedan AC did not help their cause with someone like Bernard Oparanozie in the heart of their defence.  The veteran defender, quite clearly overweight, was having a torrid time trying to keep the nippy Dipendu Biswas and Sheikh Sanjeeb in check. Rahim Nabi, who hasnt lived up to his reputation this season, also looked good. Playing a little withdrawn, he was the main supplier. He was also the extra man in the penetrative zone for Mohammedan Sporting, which helped them open the rival goalmouth so many times. They opened scorline in the 15th minute when Bungo Singh sent a cross from the right and Nabis shot struck a rival defender and reached Dipendu on the rebound. The striker promptly slotted the ball in from a goalmouth melee. The second goal, by Sanjeeb, was surely the best of the lot. Nabis pass found Sanjeeb in a difficult angle inside the box, but the strikers brilliant left-footer beat the rival custodian on the far post. The two-goal cushion seemed to bring in a bit of complacency in the Mohammedan Sporting ranks, and their unfancied neighbours came very close to pulling one back in the 42nd minute. Subrata Guha got a ball inside the box with Mohammed Refeek at his mercy, but his right-footer was too weak to test the rival keeper. Mohammedan Sporting made it 3-0 deep into injury time in the first session. Amandeep Singhs free-kick was headed down by Dipendu inside the box and Nabi made no mistake from close. The black-and-white brigade looked eager to add a few more, when a horrendous goalkeeping error by Refeek on a counter attack made it 1-3 for Mohammedan AC. The ball bounced out of Refeeks grasp following a long-ranger by Arup Sarkar, and Ari Benjamin lurking nearby, put it in. Benjamin sent a long ball from the midfield in the 62nd minute and Refeek erred in his outing and was haplessly stranded when Danny Muinro lobbed the ball into the net over the keepers head. Mohammedan Sporting coach Mohammed Habeeb wasnt at all happy with the performance of his boys. Letting in two goals quite disappointing. Anyway, Mohammedan AC also played well.  TEAMS MD.

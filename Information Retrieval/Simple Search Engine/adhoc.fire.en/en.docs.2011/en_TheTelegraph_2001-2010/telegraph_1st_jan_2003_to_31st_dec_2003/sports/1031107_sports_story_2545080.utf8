The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chambers B sample too positive 
London: European 100m champion Dwain Chambers positive test for the designer steroid THG has been confirmed by a second test. The result of the British sprinters B test was known by Thursday evening and matches that of the positive A test, a reliable source said. Once UK Athletics receives official notification of the positive B sample, a disciplinary hearing will be set up. If that hearing finds Chambers guilty, he will face a minimum ban of two years and, under the guidelines of the British Olympic Associations anti-drug stance, he would receive a life ban from Olympics. Chambers admits having taken THG, which was discovered on August 1 in an out-of-competition test in Germany, but says he was unaware of the contents of the supplements he was taking.

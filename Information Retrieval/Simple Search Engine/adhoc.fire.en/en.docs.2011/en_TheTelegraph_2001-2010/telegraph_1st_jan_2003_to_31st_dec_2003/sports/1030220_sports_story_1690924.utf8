 Namibia make England toil
 - Burger hits 85, Van Vuuren takes five  Alec Stewart cant hide a smile after diving to avoid being struck by a shot from non-striker Marcus Trescothick at St Georges Park, Port Elizabeth Wednesday. (Reuters) Port Elizabeth: An inspired innings of 85 by Jan-Berry Burger gave Namibia hope of causing the biggest shock of the World Cup before England held on to win their Group A encounter by 55 runs Wednesday. England, put into bat, were bowled out for 272, stand-in captain Alec Stewart making 60 and Marcus Trescothick 58 in a third-wicket partnership of 78 after Nick Knight and Michael Vaughan fell cheaply. Namibia made England work hard for an ultimately comfortable, if unconvincing, second victory of the tournament. Burgers innings brimmed with attacking strokes, was heading for a deserved century when he spooned a short ball from Craig White to cover. The 21-year-old Stellenbosch University student hit Whites first ball of the match for a huge six and brought his half-century up with a four through the covers off Andrew Flintoff. He found an able ally in Danie Keulder, the pair putting on 97 in 108 balls for the third wicket. With rain clouds threatening, Namibia were ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis rate, but Burgers dismissal in the 29th over changed the course of the game. Englands day got off on the wrong note when captain Nasser Hussain was ruled out with a stiff neck.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

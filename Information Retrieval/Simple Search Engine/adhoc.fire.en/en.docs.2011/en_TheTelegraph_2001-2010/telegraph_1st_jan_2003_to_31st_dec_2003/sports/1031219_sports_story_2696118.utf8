 Kafelnikov still writing farewell script
Moscow: Yevgeny Kafelnikov has already rewritten the script several times for the finale of his tennis career. Leading Russia to Davis Cup victory against France last December would be a perfect final act, he decided. When young compatriot Mikhail Youzhny stole the limelight by winning the deciding rubber in Kafelnikovs place, the older man had to think again. Perhaps a sixth Kremlin Cup title in June would make a suitable farewell point for Russias most celebrated and successful tennis player of all time? But Kafelnikov failed to stick to the script again, losing in the second round. Now the 2000 Olympic champion and the first Russian to win a Grand Slam event may have to draft a closing scene in which he just slips quietly off into the sunset. Kafelnikov himself is still keeping everyone guessing about his future but Russian tennis officials do not expect him to play again. Weve been urging him to continue but it looks as if he just doesnt have the desire to play any more, Russias Davis Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev was quoted as saying by local media. He has also gained weight, some eight kilos. A senior Russian tennis official also said that Kafelnikov would not return next year. I think Yevgeny has made up his mind already but he just likes to keep everybody guessing, he likes playing games with people, the source said. Kafelnikov, looking out of shape, was last seen in public during last months Fed Cup Final Four at Moscows Olympiiski sports complex, sitting in the stands next to his most loyal fan, former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. After a largely disappointing season in which he won only 29 matches, lost 26 and had to fend off allegations of match-rigging, Kafelnikov refused to say whether he would continue playing next year. Youll get the answer just by looking at entry sheets at various tournaments next year, he said after bowing out to Youzhny in a lacklustre second-round effort at the St Petersburg Open  his last match this year in October.

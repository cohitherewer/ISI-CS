 Maradona offered coaching post
Buenos Aires: Estudiantes coach Carlos Bilardo hopes he can link up yet again with Diego Maradona, his Argentina captain in two World Cup finals. Bilardo said there would always be a place for Maradona at the club as an assistant coach. I always want to have Diego with me. I want him at my side without a second thought, said Bilardo, who returned to his ailing former club two weeks ago. I said as soon as I took charge that if Diego wants to be with me he doesnt even have to think about it, Bilardo said. He last linked up with Maradona at Boca Juniors in 1996 when they were coach and captain, respectively, before the player retired at 36. Maradona has lived predominantly in Cuba in the last few years undergoing treatment for addiction to drugs. Estudiantes have picked up four points in two matches since Bilardo, who steered them to the Argentine League title in 1982, took over from the sacked Oscar Malbernat. Estudiantes are 12th in the Clausura Championship standings, 13 points behind joint leaders Boca Juniors and Velez Sarsfield with seven games to go.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

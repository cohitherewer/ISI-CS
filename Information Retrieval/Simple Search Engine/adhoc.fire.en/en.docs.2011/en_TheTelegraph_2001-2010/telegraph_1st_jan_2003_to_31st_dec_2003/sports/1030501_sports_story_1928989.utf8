 New contracts for English pacers
London: World Cup discovery James Anderson and fellow quick bowler Stephen Harmison have been awarded six-month central contracts by England. Both James and Stephen have shown their potential during the winter and Im sure will go on to have long and successful international careers, chairman of selectors David Graveney said on Wednesday. Lancashires Anderson was Englands leading wicket-taker in the World Cup with 10 victims costing 22.50 apiece. Durhams Harmison played four Tests versus Australia. The pair join nine others; Nasser Hussain, Mark Butcher, Andy Caddick, Andy Flintoff, Ashley Giles, Matthew Hoggard, Alec Stewart, Marcus Trescothick and Michael Vaughan.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

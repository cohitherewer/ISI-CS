The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sick Bengal content with draw
 - Five players suffer food poisoning  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ghavri feels Bengal will take heart from this show Calcutta: A sick Bengal team failed to force an outright victory and had to be contented with two points in their Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match against Tamil Nadu in Tirunelveli on Wednesday. Five players suffered from food poisoning while captain Devang Gandhi was down with fever as Bengal struggled to field 11 players on the final day. Assistant coach Satinder Singh had to field for three-and-a-half hours. Tamil Nadu took the opportunity to bat out the whole day scoring 397 for four, with S. Badrinath making 190 and S. Sharath unbeaten on 101. Earlier, on Day III, Tamil Nadu were made to follow on after they conceded a 212-run first innings lead. Pacer Shib Shankar Paul, who had wrecked Tamil Nadu in the first innings with a seven-wicket haul, took three more in the second to ensure his first 10-wicket haul in Ranji Trophy. With this result, Bengal have two points from three games while Tamil Nadu stay on nine. But it was the ailment of the Bengal boys on the final day that hogged the limelight. Talking to The Telegraph, Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri said: The players to suffer were Arindam Das, Subhamoy Das, Shib Sagar Singh, Aniruddha Roy, Sourashish Lahiri and Devang. In fact, Arindam had to be hospitalised. Ghavri, however, hoped this performance against Tamil Nadu will hold them in good stead against Assam in the next match starting at the Eden Gardens from Monday.  Copyright

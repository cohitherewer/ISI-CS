The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lunke surprise leader
Portland (Oregon): American Hilary Lunke, who has never finished higher than 15th in two years as a professional, took a one-shot lead after the third round of the $3.1 million US Womens Open at Pumpkin Ridge on Saturday. The 24-year-old fired a three-under 68 for a total of 208, five below par. Fellow countrywoman Angela Stanford, 25, who won her first LPGA title in Atlantic City last week, was in second place after birdying the last to record a 69. World No. 1 Annika Sorenstam climbed into a share of third place after posting a best-of-the-day 67. The Swede, who won her fifth major last month (the LPGA Championship), was on 211 along with South Korean pair Jang Jeong and amateur Aree Song, 17, and Mhairi McKay of Britain. McKay was four strokes clear overnight but struggled to a 75. Donna Andrews of the US was alone in seventh place on 213. (Reuters)  Copyright

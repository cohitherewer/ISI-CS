																								London: England cricketers would be unhappy to play their World Cup match in Zimbabwe if the security situation deteriorates, the England Cricket Board said Wednesday.																								Players expressed concerns about their February 13 match in Harare with ECB chairman David Morgan in Sydney.																								The talks surfaced as the ICC sent a security delegation to Zimbabwe, including president Malcolm Speed and tournament director Ali Bacher.																								The visit could open the door for the ICC to move games out of Zimbabwe to South Africa. Morgan said he was very interested in the security tour, which will report its findings at an ICC board meeting Friday.																								The players are comfortable with the conclusions that were drawn by the first visit which (ECB chief executive) Tim Lamb was on in November, but they want to be assured that the position remains as it was, Morgan said.																								Any deterioration, any risk to their safety and security, they would certainly be unhappy to go.																								Prime Minister Tony Blairs government wanted England to pull out of the match protesting the policies of President Robert Mugabe, who is blamed for violence, corruption and economic collapse in Zimbabwe.

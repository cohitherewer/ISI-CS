																								New Delhi: With the World Cup just a fortnight away, Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly Friday said the team was trying to forget the disastrous New Zealand tour.																								We are optimistic of a good show and will make all efforts to put up a good show, Sourav said.																								Sourav, who launched team sponsor Sahara India Pariwars Sahara Youth Power, admitted the team had performed below par.																								New Zealand was one of those tours where we did not play well. But we will have to look at the positives of the past 12 months and carry that on to South Africa, he said. He did not appear perturbed by renewed life-threats by a militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba. I have read about it in the newspapers. The government has provided me with security.... And thats it.																								Nehra excited																								Ashish Nehra is hoping to make a memorable World Cup debut scalping big guns. Its huge excitement and though I have not set myself any goals, wickets of Gilchrist and Hayden would be great, he said. (PTI)

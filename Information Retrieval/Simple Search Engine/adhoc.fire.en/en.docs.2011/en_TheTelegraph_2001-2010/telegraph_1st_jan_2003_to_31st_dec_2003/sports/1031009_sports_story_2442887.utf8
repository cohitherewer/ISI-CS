The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dutch coach for Pakistan
Rawalpindi: Dutchman Roelant Oltmans has been appointed as the Pakistan national teams chief hockey coach until December 2004. The appointment comes in the wake of Pakistans failure to win any major hockey title since 1994, when they won the World Cup in Sydney. Oltmans first assignment will be the Afro-Asian Games (later this month) in Hyderabad, for a week but he will properly take over from December 1 this year, Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) secretary Brigadier Musaratullah said on Wednesday. Oltmans said he was delighted at the prospect of working with the Pakistan team. Pakistan have always been a force in hockey. The skill and talent of their players are top quality, Oltmans, who guided Holland to the 1996 Olympic title in Atlanta, said in Lahore. (Reuters)  Copyright

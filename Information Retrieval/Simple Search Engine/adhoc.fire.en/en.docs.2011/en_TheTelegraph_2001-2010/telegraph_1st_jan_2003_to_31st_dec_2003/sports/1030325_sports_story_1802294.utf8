The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arranged marriage only for Yuvraj
 YUVRAJ: Moms the word Durban: If it ever comes to choosing the favourite theme song to be played when he walks to the batting crease, Yuvraj Singh would probably pick the mid-Ninties hit single Arranged Marriage by Apache Indian. Not that the dashing middle-order batsman has a particular liking for the Indi-Pop music, but his mother Shabnum Singh would have gone all the way to make sure her son remained focused on cricket. For, while Indias new-found batting sensation was trying his best extricate India from the jaws of defeat against Australia in the World Cup final in Johannesburg Sunday, Shabnum was warning South African girls to leave her son alone. Shabnam, who has been in South Africa following the Indian team for the past two weeks, said in an interview with a local newspaper that her son was too young to think about anything else but his cricketing career. She said her son was very popular among girls in India and wherever he travels around the world, but there will be no other marriage but an arranged one for my son. The girl he will marry will be my choice, she said emphatically. The girls in India like him a lot. Hes usually mobbed wherever he goes, and Ive noticed that he is very popular with South African Indian girls too. They all want his autograph and to take a photograph with him. But my son has no romantic interests. She was very proud of Yuvraj representing India and would always want him to play for the country. Yuvraj really likes South Africa. The hospitality and people have been wonderful. But he has no plans to buy property or settle here. Hes still too young, and hes still playing for his country. Yuvraj shot into fame in the 2000 ICC Cup when he played a match-winning innings against Australia in only his second game. But after that, his career took a bit of a dip and he found himself out of the squad. However, Indian captain Sourav Ganguly never lost faith in this talented left-hander and the Punjab lad didnt let his captain down. A couple of superb knocks during the NatWest Trophy in England last year proved beyond doubt that he is the real match-winner India was looking for.  (PTI)  Copyright

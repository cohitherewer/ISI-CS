 Mahmud expects inspired performance
Dhaka: Bangladesh captain Khaled Mahmud said Monday he was expecting an inspired effort from his team during their upcoming Test series against England. We have never started a home series in such a confident mood, said Mahmud. We have often done better in away series and hope to apply ourselves better this time. Bangladesh have lost 23 of their 24 Tests but twice took the first innings lead in a recent three-Test series in Pakistan, coming within one wicket of winning the third match at Multan, eventually losing 3-0. The opening Test of the first-ever series between England and Bangladesh will be played at the Bangabandhu National Stadium from Tuesday. The wicket seems to be a batting turf and we hope our batsmen do a fine job. The spinners also might get some help, Mahmud said. (AFP)  Copyright

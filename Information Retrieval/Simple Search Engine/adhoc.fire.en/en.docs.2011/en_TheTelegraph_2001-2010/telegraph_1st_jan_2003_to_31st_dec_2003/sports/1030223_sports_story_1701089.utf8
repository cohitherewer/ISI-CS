		 Sunday, February 23, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	 Pietermaritzburg: World Cup minnows Namibia have been receiving a helping hand from fellow countryman and top-class sprinter Frankie Fredericks.				 																																	Namibia opener Jan-Berry Burger said the former 200m world champion had visited the players to advise them on how to handle themselves on the world stage.				 																																	He met us and had a chat, Burger said on Saturday.				 																																	Frankie told us how to handle pressure situations, even how to tackle the media. He is among the best athletes in the world. He has been doing this for so many years now.				 																																	Namibia face India in a Group A match at the Pietermaritzburg Oval on Sunday. They lost their opening games to Zimbabwe, Pakistan and England but have put in some creditable performances, in particular in dismissing England for 272 and making 217 for nine in reply, with Burger making 85.				 																																	Potchefstroom: Australia batsman Matthew Hayden is determined to focus on cricket rather than politics as the defending champions prepare for their match against Zimbabwe on Monday. Hayden expressed reservations about the situation before Australia departed for southern Africa, but on Friday he said he was comfortable with the match going ahead and was looking forward to it. While there are enormous difficulties and troubles in the country, the ICC, the ACB and the players have taken that into account in our decisions, he said. Now we are really looking forward to showing 6000 people at the ground a great game of cricket and, hopefully, it will be a relief in their desperate situation. My feelings remain about the political situation but we are international cricketers, we love playing cricket for our country, we want to win the World Cup and we are going there to do that, he said.				 																																	Nairobi: Sri Lanka is in a unique position of being the only visiting team to play a World Cup game in Kenya.				 																																	New Zealands decision not to go to Nairobi on safety grounds means that the Kenyans will host just one game on Monday at the Gymkhana Club.				 																																	Handed four points because New Zealand forfeited the game, the Kenyans have eight points because they also beat Canada by four wickets at Cape Town, a week ago.				 																																	According to Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya that makes Kenya dangerous in the shake-up to see which three Group B teams qualify for the next round.				 																																	You cant take anything for granted, he said. Its a funny game and you just can never tell how its going to be so we have to be at our best all the time.				 																																	n India vs Namibia live from 1.30 pm 				 																																	on Max and 1.10 pm on DD1 n West Indies vs Canada live from 1.30 pm on 				 																																	Sony n England vs Pakistan, highlights from 10.30 pm on Max n South Africa vs Bangladesh, repeat from 12 midnight

 Pathan may get Akram tips
Ahmedabad, Nov. 8 (PTI): Irfan Pathan may get a few tips from his hero Wasim Akram in the near future.  I have heard a lot about Pathan seen him on TV. I will give him some useful tips when I meet him, Akram said. Pathan had earlier said he had modelled himself on the former Pakistan captain. Meanwhile, Akram backtracked on his earlier remark and came out in full support of Shoaib Akhtar. Akram, who had earlier advised Shoaib to talk less and let the ball do the talking, opined that cricket needs characters like his countrymate. Shoaib is a character in himself...It is required for the game today... My advice is he should remain the same, he said.  Copyright

 Kapil Dev for five bowlers
Moradabad: Former captain Kapil Dev feels the induction of a fifth regular bowler and two genuine allrounders can make the Indian team an unbeatable side. The present side is far better than the previous ones. If a regular fifth bowler and two allrounders are brought in, it can become almost invincible, Kapil said on Monday. He also had a word of praise for Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh. If they can find their rhythm, they can change the course of the game easily, Kapil added.  (PTI)  Copyright

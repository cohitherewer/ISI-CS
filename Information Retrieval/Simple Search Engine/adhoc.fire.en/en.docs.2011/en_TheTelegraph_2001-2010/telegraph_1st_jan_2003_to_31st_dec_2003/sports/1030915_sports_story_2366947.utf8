 Shane Mosley surprises De la Hoya
 Shane Mosley after his triumph on Saturday Las Vegas: Shane Mosley captured the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association super-welterweight titles on Saturday, with a stunning unanimous decision over favourite Oscar de la Hoya. All three judges scored the fight 115-113 in favour of Mosley. I won by power and speed and most effective shots, said Mosley, who registered his second-straight win over De la Hoya. I had the more powerful punches and was a lot stronger than he was. De la Hoya thought he had won the fight at the end of the 12th and final round as he climbed the ropes and raised both hands over his head. Floyd Mayweather, De la Hoyas trainer, blasted the judges decision and said De la Hoya fought a perfect fight. These old judges are blind and senile. Clearly Oscar won the fight, said Mayweather. He got a little tired in the tenth and eleventh but he picked it up in the 12th. I dont know what he has to do to win a fight. Mosley looked surprised as the judges scores were read out and many in the crowd booed the announcement thinking that De la Hoya had won easily. Maybe my style is little difficult for him, said Mosley. I was a lot stronger than the first time I fought him. He is a great warrior I take my hat off to him. De la Hoya started strong, dominating the early rounds before suffering a cut near his right eye in the fourth round from an accidental head butt. But the judges obviously felt De la Hoya faded in the later rounds and that Mosley took over. De la Hoya was looking to avenge the earlier loss  the only indisputable loss of his illustrious career. I am not disappointed, said De la Hoya. I was keeping him at a distance. It was a hard fight. Mosley, 32, wanted to win this fight to prove his first victory over De la Hoya three years ago was no fluke and re-establish himself as an elite fighter. De la Hoya said earlier he would retire if he lost to Mosley. Former heavyweight champion George Foreman didnt agree with the decision. This is terrible. This is not what boxing is supposed to be. De la Hoya won, said Foreman from his ringside seat.  (AFP)  Copyright

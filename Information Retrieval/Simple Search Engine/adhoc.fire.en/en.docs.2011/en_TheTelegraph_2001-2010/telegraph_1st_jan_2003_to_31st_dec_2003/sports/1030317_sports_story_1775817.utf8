The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Donald backs India vs Aussies
Durban: Former South African speedster Allan Donald feels India must bat second if they are to beat Australia in a likely showdown in the World Cup final. This Indian team is hot. Only India have the goods to beat the Australians, Donald wrote in his syndicated column. I would advise (skipper Sourav Ganguly) to bat second if he wins the toss against Australia. I think India would find it easier to play the Aussies that way, Donald said. When they bat first, they seem too anxious to preserve wickets in the first 15 overs, and dont play too well. Batting second will make them more relaxed as there is a tangible total to target. The fearsome fast bowler, who announced his retirement after his sides early World Cup exit, said India had gained much in confidence after their defeat to Australia in the league stages and backed them to halt the record winning streak of the Aussies. Sometimes, playing so well for so long just implies that a reversal is coming up soon. Who knows, India, who broke Australias 16-Test winning streak, could also break their record streak in one-dayers, he said. Donald said for Australia Sachin Tendulkar would obviously be the prime target but felt the master batsman hardly looked vulnerable on his current form. Tendulkar is in sublime form, and I doubt that he will be intimidated or subdued by anything the Australians dish out for him.  (PTI)  Copyright

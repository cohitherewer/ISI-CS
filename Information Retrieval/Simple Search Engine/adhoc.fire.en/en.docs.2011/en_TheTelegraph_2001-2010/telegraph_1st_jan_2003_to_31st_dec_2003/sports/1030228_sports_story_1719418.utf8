The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bacher stands by day-night affairs
East London: There will be no change in the World Cup fixtures despite allegations that conditions favour sides batting first in day-night matches, tournament executive director Ali Bacher said Thursday. Definitely not, said Bacher, when asked whether a change was possible. Im no expert on weather conditions but the locals say that a lot depends on which way the wind blows and how much humidity there is, said Bacher. That is part of cricket. Conditions can change, as they do in day games as well when there is early life in the pitch or cloud cover. Statistics going back to the first ODI in Durban in 1992-93 showed an even spread of wins for the sides batting first and second, said Bacher. Of 15 day-night games at Kingsmead, seven were won by the side batting first, seven by the side batting second and one was a no-result. Bacher said the two venues selected for day-night matches in the World Cup were Kingsmead and Newlands in Cape Town because they were the only grounds with suitable floodlights that were unlikely to be affected by dew, which could be a factor in inland centres such as Johannesburg and Centurion. The majority of our spectators are South Africans and the number one cricket product for them is day-night cricket because they have to watch the games after working hours, said Bacher. Meanwhile, Pakistan captain warned organisers that one of the World Cup finalists could be decided by the toss of a coin if they stick to their plans of staging the second semi-final under lights. Waqar said: It has become obvious that, in the matches played under lights , teams winning the toss are getting an unfair advantage. I would say any team which wins the toss has won 75 per cent of the game.  (AFP)  Copyright

 More bad news for Mashud
Dhaka: Bangladesh selectors on Friday dropped former captain Khaled Mashud from the 14-member squad for the two-Test series against South Africa starting on April 24. He has been replaced by Mohammed Salim. Earlier, Mashuds exclusion for their last tri-series match was criticised by the Bangladesh media. It raised accusations that the selection panel led by Aliul Islam had started functioning like an autonomous body. The media called it a strange and controversial selection of players and said the mindless chopping and changing had done little to help the confidence of players. Selim was asked to check-in at the team hotel at around midnight on the eve of the match and Islam had instructed him to tell the management that he would replace Mashud for the last match. Squad Khaled Mahmud (captain), Mehrab Hossain, Mohammed Ashraful, Javed Omar, Habibul Bashar, Akram Khan, Sanwar Hossain, Mohammed Salim, Alok Kapali, Mohammed Rafique, Tapash Baishya, Monjural Islam, Mashrafi bin Murtaza, Enamul Hoque.

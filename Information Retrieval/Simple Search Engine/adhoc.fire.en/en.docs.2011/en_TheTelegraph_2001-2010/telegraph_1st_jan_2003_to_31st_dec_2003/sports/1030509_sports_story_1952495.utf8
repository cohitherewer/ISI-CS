The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia keen on foreign stint
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia at a promotional campaign in the city Thursday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia has achieved almost all that is there on offer in Indian football. And, having already plied his trade where the standard of football is higher, the Indian striker is raring to have another go. The Singapore option is still open, but Bhutias ambition doesnt end there. He is aiming for Europe and his agent is already in touch with some clubs there. My agent based in UK, with whom I dont have an official contract, is looking for an opening, the star striker told The Telegraph Thursday. If things work out, I will go for trial, he said. And somewhat reluctantly, he added it may happen as early as sometime before June. Thats the deadline because Bhutia is not closing the Indian option and if he signs for an Indian club other than the city giants, he has to take the inter-state transfer by May 31. Bhutia didnt specify which country he is looking at. Its too early. Bhutia spent three seasons with the English second division side Bury FC from 1999. He is still hopeful of landing a three-month stint with a Singapore club, but then, he is likely to take up the European challenge if he clinches the deal there. Earlier, at a promotional campaign at CCFC, Bhutia mildly attacked the East Bengal secretary who had reportedly gone on record saying that the player was not good enough to represent the National League champions. I dont think that was a mature statement. It was something you expect from a club fan, not a club official, he said.  Copyright

 Uzbek stops Susanthika dominance
Pathum Thani (Thailand): Uzbek sprinter Khubbieva Guzel ended Olympic medallist Susanthika Jayasinghes dominance with an upset win in the womens 100 m at Thammasat Rangsit main stadium in the third meet of the Asian Grand Prix series. Guzel was quick out of the blocks and held off a fast-finishing Jayasinghe to finish in 11.30 seconds. Jayasinghe, who won the 100m at the first two meets in India and Sri Lanka, was 0.01 seconds behind in second place with Thailands Oranuch Klomdee in third. Kazakhstans Gennadiy Chernoval had no problem completing a hattrick in the mens 100m at 10.42 seconds. Sri Lanka, however, retained its pride with Damayanthi Darshas comfortable win in the womens 400m. The Asian Games double gold medallist was the runaway winner at 52.2 seconds. (AP)  Copyright

 AC Milan join Juventus at the top

(AP) Milan: European champions AC Milan beat Lazio 1-0 at the San Siro on Sunday to join Juventus at the top of Serie A, while AS Roma kept in touch as goals from Walter Samuel and Antonio Cassano gave them a 2-0 home win over Parma. Roma inflicted Parmas first loss of the season to move into second place on 14 points, two behind champions Juve and Milan. A 37th minute goal from Andrea Pirlo won an entertaining encounter for Milan after Carlo Ancelottis side suffered some early pressure from Lazio. The visitors thought they had taken the lead in the 17th minute when Dejan Stankovic turned in a pass from Bernardo Corradi but the goal was ruled out for offside  a decision that appeared harsh on the television replay. Milans goal came when Cafus fierce shot was parried by Angelo Peruzzi, the Lazio defence failed to clear and, after Filippo Inzaghis shot was blocked, Pirlo pounced. Unbeaten Roma look back to their best this season and underlined their re-emergence with a sparkling display against Parma. Argentine defender Walter Samuel put Roma ahead in the 29th minute with a left foot finish after a skilful run and cross from the left by highly promising midfielder Daniele De Rossi. Antonio Cassano, another exciting Roma youngster, made it 2-0 on the hour with a header at the back post after more excellent work from De Rossi. It was a topsy-turvy day for Bologna striker Fausto Rossini, whose headed own goal after 48 minutes put his side behind at home to Perugia. The visitors added a second in the 69th minute when English striker Jay Bothroyd tapped home after a dreadful mix-up in the Bologna defence. But former Chelsea midfielder Samuele Dalla Bona pulled one back for Bologna in the 71st minute before Rossini made amends for his earlier blunder with the equaliser  a smart back-heel to turn in a Fabio Pecchia shot. Valencia were in devastating form as they crushed bottom club Espanyol 4-0 at the Mestalla to record their sixth win on the trot and reclaim top spot in the Primera Liga. Two goals from striker Mista and one from the outstanding Ruben Baraja put Valencia 3-0 up by the break and winger Vicente added a fourth 11 minutes from time to complete the rout against a sorry-looking Espanyol, who have yet to win this season. The result means Valencia, who have conceded just one goal in their seven matches, retain top spot after the weekends matches with 19 points, one ahead of Deportivo Coruna. Osasuna, who are more accustomed to battling it out at the other end of the table, regained fourth spot after a goal in each half from Ivory Coast striker Ibrahima Bakayoko gave them a 2-1 win against nine-man Murcia at El Sadar. Atletico Madrid moved out of the relegation zone after a sweetly struck free kick from substitute Jorge gave them a last gasp 2-1 victory at home to Real Mallorca, who remain in trouble. Tottenham Hotspur stole a barely deserved 2-1 victory at bottom club Leicester City in the Premier League. A 79th-minute goal by South African substitute Mbulelo Mabizela on his debut and a last-minute winner from Frederic Kanoute turned the match on its head after a Kasey Keller blunder allowed Paul Dickov to give Leicester a first-half lead. The win meant Spurs jumped to 11th with 11 points, while Leicester remained a point adrift at the bottom on five points.

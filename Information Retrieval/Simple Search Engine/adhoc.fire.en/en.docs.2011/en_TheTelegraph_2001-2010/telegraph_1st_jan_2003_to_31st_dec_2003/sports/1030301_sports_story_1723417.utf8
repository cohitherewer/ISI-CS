The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB to cash in on good run 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Gilmar: Likely to be back Calcutta: East Bengal aim to wrap things up before the National Football League goes for a month-long break from March 7. Talking to reporters on the eve of their match against Tollygunge Agragami, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said: I dont want to keep things pending for April. We are going through a good phase and want to cash in on that. East Bengal are currently on 40 points and victories against Tollygunge Agragami and JCT in the next two games will take them to 46, which according to the coach is enough to clinch the title. But with the Sashthi Duley and Mike Okoro (both double booking) to sit out the Tollygunge game, Bhowmick has to fall back on his reserve bench, that has done wonders for the team. Gilmar Goncalves, the Brazilian forward who was nursing an injury, is likely to make a comeback. Also, Alvito is nursing an injury and the coach may decide to give him a rest. In that case, either Malswamtluanga or Subhas Chakraborty will start. But the coach doesnt want to take Tollygunge Agragami lightly. They have a very organised midfield and with Ashim Biswas and Akeem Abolanle upfront, I cannot take anything for granted, Bhowmick added. Moreover, the pressure is on us to get full points, and any slip-up here, we might just find ourselves in a bit of a hole. On the other hand, the Tollygunge Agragami coach Aloke Mukherjee said that his boys will go into the match with an open mind. We have nothing to lose and a point here will help us make-up for the lapse against HAL, Mukherjee added. Tollygunge were held to a 3-3 draw in that game. Its also an opportunity for the boys to make a mark before the inter-club transfers start. So Im sure, they will give their best, the coach added. Meanwhile Dempo will meet Vasco in another NFL match at the Nehru Stadium in Margao Saturday.  Copyright

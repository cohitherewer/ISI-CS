The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ponting, Fleming are skippers who caught the eye: Bob Woolmer
- The laws and playing conditions dont allow coaches room to manoeuvre  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI FLEMING: Makes it difficult for the opposition Johannesburg: South Africa may have overtaken Australia in the Test Championship table, but the Bob Woolmer years (1993-1993) remain the Proteas best. After all, as coach, he took South Africa to another level and, since his exit (after the last World Cup), the United Cricket Board has struggled to find the right successor.The Kanpur-born Woolmer, of course, continues to be in demand and, if the terms are mutually acceptable, he could head for the West Indies as early as next month. Among the finest readers of the game, Woolmer spoke to The Telegraph in Cape Town last evening  the interview exclusively limited to the top captains and coaches in World Cup 2003.

The following are excerpts On the captains who have impressed him most in this editionFrankly, nobody has been outstanding... However, Ricky Ponting and Stephen Fleming have certainly caught the eye... Its obvious that both have done their homework. Also, captaincy calls for a certain discipline  both have that. PONTING: Is pro-active On Ponting: Has always looked in control, which is expected of a good captain. I think there have been traces of flexibility and innovativeness... A captain who wishes to be different must quickly respond to situations... He could be pro-active as well. Ill give high marks to Ponting on different fronts and the one move I especially liked was when he quickly brought on Andy Bichel (against England). That turned the match on its head.On Fleming: Again, always seems in control and gives the impression of getting the best out of his players... Moreover, he creates pressure, making it difficult for the opposition. While I cant pick any one move as being outstanding, I ought to make a mention of his brilliant unbeaten 134 versus South Africa (at the Wanderers)... A captain should lead from the front and that innings serves as an excellent example.On Sourav Ganguly: The team has been doing well under him, but I havent studied him enough to form a definite opinion. I havent spoken to him either... Besides being flexible and innovative, a good captain must be mentally tough and possess external skills too. For instance, handling the media has become an important aspect... Generally, it helps if the captain has a high cricket intellect.[The interview, by the way, took place before Sourav anchored India to the six-wicket win over Kenya, or else Woolmer would surely have commented on that excellent effort.]On the coaches who have impressed him most in this World Cup(Grins) Look, the laws and playing conditions are such that coaches dont have much room to manoeuvre. Therefore, its difficult choosing the most outstanding. But, yes, John Buchanan appears a cut above the rest, while John Wright and Dav Whatmore have done a fine job. BUCHANAN: Always in control On Buchanan: Its easy to say that Buchanan has such a gifted bunch to work with. Where Im concerned, though, he merits praise for the outstanding manner in which the Australian team prepares itself.On Wright: A coach needs to be caring and must always be concerned about his players. Wright gives the impression that he is both, plus its pretty evident that he has been working hard with your team.On Whatmore: Deserves credit for helping turn the team around after that disastrous tour of South Africa, not many months ago. A quiet worker with clear goals.Finally, on whether it hurt when the tied game in Durban threw South Africa out of the tournament(After a pause) I felt for the boys... appreciated what they must have gone through... Its easy to sit in judgement and say that the thinktank got the (229/230) calculation wrong but, yes, enough attention probably wasnt paid to small details. In a high-pressure  Copyright

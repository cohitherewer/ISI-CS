The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Encourage, dont deride lesser teams
 Cutting Edge/Bobby Simpson Despite some bleatings from the  Australian press about the rights of the lesser nations  to play in the World Cup, I feel the ICC have got it about  right. Certain writers in Australia have suggested that  the competition has become blighted by meaningless matches  and suggesting that 14 teams are too many and six weeks  too long. What rubbish! Yes, there will  be one-sided matches, but these are not restricted to minor  countries as the IndiaAustralia match showed. One of the  minnows, Canada have defeated a Test playing nation, Bangladesh,  and Namibia gave England one hell of a fight just a few  days ago.  World Cups and indeed international  cricket should never be an elitist game and I was of the  opinion that this thinking had gone out many years ago.  Obviously, in some people it hasnt. Obviously, also the  memory of some writers is very short for if it hadnt been  for the World Cup former minnows such as Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe  would still be playing the ICC Trophy.  Sri Lanka, of course, have won  a World Cup and are one of the most feared teams in one-day  Internationals. Zimbabwe have done well from such a small  player base and have executed a sterling and successful  job taking cricket to the black community. Without international  recognition they would have gone backwards and broke. To  survive and prosper, cricket must grow and develop the game  outside the traditional countries. It wont happen if lesser  countries are not assisted. 				 				 				 		At this point some of the new  teams are not up to the standards of the great cricket nations.  But this doesnt stop them loving, cherishing and enjoying  the game just as much as the top team. In many cases they  probably love the game more for to compete in a game, which  in some cases is almost foreign and unknown in their country,  takes great passion and perseverance.  The minnows, as some writers  are now calling them, (God, I hate that expression) dont  get asked to play in the World Cup. They win the right by  performances on the field. As such they deserve respect  and encouragement, not derision.  Australia at one time had a very  narrow view on elevating teams to the exclusive Test club.  In my long Test career, I didnt play a Test against New  Zealand. Other countries had been competing for over 20  or 30 years against New Zealand. Why? Mainly because we  played one Test against them in Wellington in 1946, caught  them on a wet wicket, and bowled them out twice, for less  than a hundred each innings, after Australia had compiled  a good score on a dry track.  How arrogant that we could judge  and ignore them for nearly 30 years based on such scant  evidence. Perhaps we were a little jealous of their performance  in other sports. Based on a population, they are undoubtedly  the top sporting nation in the world, but please dont ever  tell them I said this. Australia fortunately now realise  we must give every assistance to the minor nations and this  year are hosting a Test series against Bangladesh.  Appreciating that Bangladesh will  not draw in the major cities and the normal cricket season  is already over-crowded, Australia will play this series  in our winter. Obviously you cant play in the southern  states, with the exception of Melbourne which has an indoor  stadium. The game will be played in the tropical north in  Queensland and the northern territory.  Cairns and Darwin both have cricket  grounds more than suitable for Test matches. Innovative  thinking such as this will open up a window of opportunity  for Australia to fulfill their promise and responsibility  to developing nations.  In a different way the extra teams  and time taken for the preliminary rounds have added a new  dimension, the weather. South Africa after defeats by the  West Indies and New Zealand looked as though they were dead  and buried to progress through to the Super Six stage. Now, with rain costing the Windies  a win against Bangladesh, South Africa are now in with a  hope. They will remember in 1992 Pakistan after being bowled  out for a very low score against England picked up the point  they needed when rain washed out play to proceed to the  crown. One-day cricket is a tough game with many twists  and turns. A poor umpiring decision, a couple of rash strokes  or losing the wrong toss can all lead to a surprise victory  by the lesser team.  So far the batsmen have dominated  the series and that should come as no surprise for the rules  and pitch preparation are designed in favour of the batsmen.  After a period of poor one-day pitches, Africa have come  up with some beauties. They are flat, a little pacy and  very consistent. They are ideal for strokes off either the  back or front foot.  To succeed or even exert pressure  on such pitches bowlers must have pin-point accuracy and  clever variation of pace. Neither of these qualities have  been evident so far from teams except Australia. It is almost  as if the rest of the teams are working from the same plan.  Give it a bit of a go early and after that try to bowl yorkers,  the script seems to read.  Unfortunately, few bowlers seem  capable of implementing the plans. Too much width seems  to be the main problem and with this, of course, the poor  old captain hasnt got enough fielders to defend the whole  field. The yorker is near impossible to bowl. If any ball  pitches and goes under the bat in the block hole, the batsman  has missed an opportunity to hit it on the full. The yorker  is only possible if the batsman misjudges the flight of  the ball. Of course all batsmen do and some bowlers seem  to be able to achieve it more than others.  I always felt that bowlers with  suspicious actions did it better than perfectly correct  bowlers, for they could achieve more or less pace by just  quickening or slowing the elbow at the point of delivery.  This gives this style of bowler a great advantage because  you pick up their variation much slower than other bowlers. To my mind, far too many yorkers  are being tried. It is a high risk delivery and give batsmen  far too many opportunities to take it on the full or half  volley. Like a slower delivery it should be used sparingly.  Bowlers win matches in Test or  one-day cricket. At present only Australia are bowling in  top form and as such will be the toughest to beat. GAMEPLAN Copyright

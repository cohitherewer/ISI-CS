 Chandhoks second win in F3 circuit
New Delhi: Indias Karun Chandhok dominated the Scholarship Class in the British Formula 3 championship, winning the first of two races at the Croft circuit in Yorkshire on Sunday. The 19-year-old now leads the championship table ahead of Steven Kane and Ernesto Viso. Chandhok clinched the pole in both the races before proceeding to register his second win of the season winning the fifth round. In the second race (sixth round), Chandhok was leading, going into the last lap and in sight of the chequered flag, when teammate Kane banged into the right side taking both the cars out of the race, a media release from JK Tyres, Chandhoks sponsors said here on Monday. Earlier, the T-sport driver did remarkably well to clinch his first F3 pole in wet conditions. Then Chandhok made it a double, grabbing the top spot in the second qualifying session in the evening. In round 5, he got held up by some of the Championship Class cars going into the hairpin and Ivor McCullough got ahead, only to make a mistake on the next lap, allowing Chandhok through to the number one position again. From there on, the T-sport kept the stiff competition at bay to come out on top. The next two races will be held at the Knockhill circuit in Scotland.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Milan vow to go all out vs Real
 - Champions League - Spaniards sweat  over Ronaldo fitness; United wait for Basle SHEVCHENKO: Fit  for selection  Paris: Real Madrid have  been given fair warning  AC Milan will show them the utmost  respect by aiming to win their Champions League quarter  final tie at the Bernabeu Stadium on Wednesday.  In different circumstances the  reigning European champions might be pleased by the Italian  giants offer of playing to their full potential. Borussia Dortmund, third in the  same group and who take on Lokomotiv Moscow the same evening,  will certainly be happy about the Italians sporting promise. However, AC Milan have already  qualified for the quarters, and Reals pre-match nerves  will be strained in the knowledge that star Brazilian Ronaldo,  who has been so influential recently in their domestic campaign,  could be sidelined. He might or might not play,  said Reals doctor Alfonso Del Corral on Monday, who explained  that the Brazilian was carrying a thigh injury. But the possibilities of Ronaldo  playing are not enormous. Ronaldos absence is arguably  irrelevant to a Real side brimming with stars. The situation  would definitely be worse if Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo,  Raul and Guti were all on the injury couch. However the fact is that Real,  second in Group C on five points  only one ahead of Dortmund   are still battling to secure their quarter final place.  AC Milan, on the other hand, have  breezed their way to the top, claiming 12 points from their  four matches so far, and their renaissance as a European  football power does not appear to be slowing down. With influential Ukrainian Andrei  Shevchenko fit for selection, after his promising return  to the league last weekend, Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti  has the luxury of resting striker Filippo Inzaghi. But they will nevertheless be  without midfielder Massimo Ambrosini and 22-year-old Georgian  defender Kakha Kaladze, both injured. Borussia Dortmund will be hoping  AC Milan stick to their promise they have never lost to  a Russian team in European competition. Dortmund also won their away match  2-1 in the Russian capital before Christmas  although that  was their only win of the group phase. In Group D fixtures are just as  delicately poised. Manchester United, also qualified  following their 3-0 win over a flu-hit Juventus, are in  a similar position to their Milanese counterparts.  And going on recent performances  in Europe, Alex Fergusons men would have to have a severe  breakdown before allowing FC Basel to leave Old Trafford  with three potentially life saving points. Basel have been the revelation  in Europe this season a though their only points in the  group came from a 1-0 win over Deportivo Coruna in February. The Swiss minnows may take solace  in the knowledge that United could field a more youthful  side in the absence of key players such as Roy Keane, while  Argentine Juan Sebastine Veron is doubtful. Juventus, who sit second in the  group on four points, host Deportivo, third on four points,  in a crucial match where coach Marcello Lippi will ask French  phenomenon David Trezeguet to come up with more of his magic. Trezeguet came off the bench on  Sunday to score a spectacular goal to end Udineses unblemished  home record and hand Lippi a 1-0 league win which pushed  Juventus three points clear of Inter Milan. As far as history is concerned,  Juventus have the upper hand, only conceding one defeat  from 17 matches against Spanish teams at home. But Lippi  would be wise to command his troops to keep tabs on Deportivos  Dutch striker, Roy Makaay, who has netted 27 times in all  competitions this season.  (AFP) Copyright

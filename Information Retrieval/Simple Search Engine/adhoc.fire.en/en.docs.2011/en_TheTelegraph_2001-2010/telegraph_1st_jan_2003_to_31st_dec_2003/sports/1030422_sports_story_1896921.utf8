The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Love keeps up winning heritage 
 Davis Love III won his fifth Heritage title Sunday Hilton Head (South Carolina): Davis Love III birdied the fourth sudden death playoff hole to defeat Woody Austin and win The Heritage for a fifth time on Sunday. Love, whose previous playoff record was 1-7, glanced his approach shot off the flagstick at the par-four 18th hole and then made a three-foot putt to win. It was a little too long and its unfortunate, both for Woody and myself, that we didnt hit a good putt or a good shot when we needed it and finish it earlier, Love said. But somehow, thats the way playoffs seem to go. Loves victory in the $4.5 million event is his third of 2003, matching his career-best season of 1992. The two players finished the four rounds on 13-under-par 271, a stroke ahead of David Gossett (66), Australian Geoff Ogilvy (67), Chris Riley (67) and 2004 US Ryder Cup captain Hal Sutton (68) at 12 under. Matt Gogel (68), Tom Pernice Jr. (68) and Steve Flesch (69) finished at 11-under 273. The leaderboard took definitive shape when world number two Ernie Els double bogeyed the 16th hole and dropped from 14 to 12-under, opening the door for more than a half dozen players. Els would finish with a 69 for a 274 total  tied for 10th. Late in the afternoon, Sutton and Austin were alone at 13-under, but Sutton bogeyed the 72nd hole to drop back, leaving Austin in sole possession of the lead  albeit briefly. Love, playing in the next to last group, chipped in from right of the 18th green to tie Austin for the lead. Austin then followed Love by getting up and down for par to force the playoff. I hung in there all week, Love said. I hit a lot of funny and uncharacteristic shots for me in this tournament.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

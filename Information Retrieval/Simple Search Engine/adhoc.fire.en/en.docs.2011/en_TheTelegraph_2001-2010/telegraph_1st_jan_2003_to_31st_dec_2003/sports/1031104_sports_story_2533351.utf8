She will participate in the Scottish and British junior Opens next month, a Squash Rackets Federation of India release said on Monday. 				 																																	London: Liverpool boss Gerald Houllier is confident he can persuade star striker Michael Owen to stay on Merseyside, despite persistent rumours linking him with a move next summer. Owen has fuelled the speculation by stalling on signing a new contract at Liverpool and it was reported on Sunday that Real Madrid are planning a  25-million bid for the England striker, who has 18 months left on his current deal. But Houllier, who is attempting to reshape his Liverpool side as a more attacking outfit which will gift Owen more opportunity to express his predatory skills, insisted he would not sell even for twice that price. 				 																																	Hong Kong: Hong Kong has been officially chosen to host the fifth East Asian Games in 2009, a government official said on Monday. Hong Kong beat Taipei during a vote in neighbouring Macau, after Mongolia withdrew its bid to host the Games.

She said the games were a golden opportunity to lift the standards of local athletes.				 																																	Macau is to host the fourth East Asian Games in 2005, after Osaka staged the third in 2001.

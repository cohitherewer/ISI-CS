 India will pose big challenge: Akram
Dubai: Wasim Akram believes India will come back stronger from the Australian tour and will pose a big challenge to Pakistan in the forthcoming series. The Indian team will be a very tough side especially after the series in Australia. By the time they come back, they would have improved a lot. Akram said. Whether they lose or win in Australia their confidence will be sky high. So, Pakistan will have to start their homework now as there will be a lot of pressure on them. They ought to really do well if they have to beat India, he told Gulf News. India is scheduled to tour Pakistan soon after it returns from Down Under but the itinerary has not been finalised yet. PCB, which is facing heavy financial losses, has proposed to play three Test and seven one-day Internationals during the tour. Akram was also happy with the performance of Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra. They need to play more cricket and the more they play against better teams and on different wickets, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hayden: Life wont change
	 - Difficult speculating who can get past me  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta, Oct. 11: Matthew Hayden didnt sleep very well last night (I tossed and turned) but, this morning, wasnt complaining. He did, after all, wake up owning the most envied record in cricket  highest scorer in a single Test innings. My mind kept going at a million miles an hour, was Haydens response to a query from The Telegraph. Not many hours earlier, he made Heath Streaks Zimbabweans see a million stars in broad daylight. The answers, to a string of questions from here, were conveyed telephonically through a Cricket Australia (CA) official this afternoon  specifically, after stumps on Day III of the Perth Test. Despite going five better than Brian Laras 375, though, Hayden doesnt believe life will change. The values Ive been exposed to throughout my life are such that success isnt going to change me I dont see why I shouldnt remain the same person. Its going to be tough arguing with that. Moreover, contrary to the janatas belief, Hayden is convinced his history-creating 380 wont add to the pressures which inevitably exist at the highest level. Im part of such a terrific team and, so, theres no question of getting weighed down Our style is such we dont allow ourselves to be consumed by pressure Its an absolute honour being part of a side which has allowed me to set a record. Ive been lucky. Haydens reply to when the achievement really did sink in, was fascinating  quite like his essay at the WACA Ground: Perhaps, it never will. Incidentally, crickets newest record-holder was most thrilled to learn that infant daughter Grace (Gracie) kept blowing kisses at the TV during his 622-minute innings. Hayden, by the way, will be joined by his wife (Kelly) and daughter before the second Test, in Sydney from Friday. They didnt take the first flight to Perth (from Brisbane) as, typically, the champion opener is focussed on the on-going Test. Its no surprise that, following-on, Zimbabwe are in the doldrums. While Hayden hasnt set a fresh target, he is looking forward to touring Sri Lanka in early 2004 and, then, returning to India for the 2004-2005 Test series. I havent played in Sri Lanka, so that trip means a lot The pinnacle, however, will be next seasons Test series in India Again, thats something Im already looking forward to A number of challenges lie ahead and that trip is right at the top. The India-bit is understandable as the last series (2000-2001) saw the rebirth of Hayden as an International. He hasnt looked back since taking guard at the Wankhede 32 months ago. Hayden didnt exactly confirm dedicating his feat to the Australian victims of the Bali blasts, a year ago, but did say they were uppermost in his thoughts. Yesterday, he emotionally revealed that the black armband (in memory of the victims) and the Baggy Green had more than inspired: Those two things just kept me going To a question on who he felt could get past him, Hayden answered: Id never backed myself to beat Lara, not even in my wildest dreams Its difficult speculating Yet, I do accept that records are meant to be broken. Yes, but Meanwhile, CA is still finalising plans to suitably commemorate the achievement.  Copyright

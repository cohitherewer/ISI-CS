The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Austria sure of retaining venue
Vienna: Austria remains confident of retaining the Spielberg Grand Prix despite Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone terminating the contract for next season. Ecclestone opted out of his contract with the A1 Ring on Tuesday, one day before the option expired, due to the countrys backing of EU legislation against tobacco advertising. Hermann Schuetzenhoefer, head of sports for the province of Styria where the circuit lies, said it was a mere technicality and did not mean there would be no Austrian Grand Prix in 2004. I remain as ever convinced that the Formula One Grand Prix 2003 was not the last one in Styria, he said. (Reuters)  Copyright

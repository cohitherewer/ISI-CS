 JCT snap EB unbeaten run with 2-0 victory 
Ludhiana: With one goal in each half, JCT, Phagwara shocked favourites and Oil PSU National Football League leaders East Bengal 2-0 in the 18th round at the Guru Nanak Stadium here Wednesday. The star of the days match was striker I. M. Vijayan, who, beside scoring a goal, played a major role in giving JCT the lead in the first half. This was East Bengals first defeat in the current league. Just a minute before the breather, JCT drew first blood when Vijayan centred to Joe Paul Anchery who blasted home. JCT continued with their pressure tactics and they got their second goal when the East Bengal goalkeeper did manage to collect Vijayans powerful angular shot from a flag kick, but had himself crossed the goalline .

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Habeebs Md. Sp. stint may be over
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Habeeb will leave for Hyderabad on Wednesday Calcutta: Mohammed Habeebs stint with Mohammedan Sporting seems to be over. It was learnt that the coach, who has been with the team for the last two seasons, has told the officials that he is not willing to continue any more. A top Mohammedan Sporting official informed that the coach will return to Hyderabad on Wednesday. If he is not willing to come back, we will not persuade him, the official, preferring anonymity told The Telegraph. In fact, the Mohammedan Sporting officials were set to show-cause Habeeb following the teams dismal loss 1-3 loss to Ever-Ready in the IFA Shield quarter final on Monday. Weve struck a real low and had no option but to showcause him, the official said. However, the official maintained they wouldnt have removed Habeeb, had he not showed his unwillingness. But Habeeb did not concede he is all set to leave. We had so many injuries in our ranks in the game against Ever-Ready. And you cannot judge the performance of a team on the basis of one game, Habeeb defended. In fact, the club authorities have also decided to release some players before their next campaign in the Airlines Gold Cup. The names will be finalised in a few days, the official added.  Copyright

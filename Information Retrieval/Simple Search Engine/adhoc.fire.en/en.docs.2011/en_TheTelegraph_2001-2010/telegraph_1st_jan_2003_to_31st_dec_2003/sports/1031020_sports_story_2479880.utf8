The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aamer Sohail started it, I retaliated, says More
	 - THE 1992 WORLD CUP SLEDGING CONTROVERSY AS SEEN BY JAVED MIANDAD IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  More feels Miandad started  on the kangaroo loke act after one of his appeals was  made with a jump Chandigarh: Javed Miandad has saddled Kiran More with all the blame for instigating his kangaroo-like act during the 1992 World Cup, in Sydney, but More (now a national selector) doesnt quite agree. Miandads views on that incident have found prominence in his recently-published autobiography, Cutting Edge. He is currently into yet another innings as the Pakistan coach. In fact, Aamer Sohail started it... He kept hurling the choicest of gaalis  something thats a feature of every India versus Pakistan game  and Miandad took offence when I retaliated, More told The Telegraph on Sunday afternoon. Sohail, like Miandad a former captain, now chairs Pakistans selection committee. More added: Things began to hot up when I appealed for a catch down leg off Sachin Tendulkar... Miandad got worked up and asked me to shut up... I responded by saying mind your business... What kept bugging Miandad is that I was asking the bowlers to get him to drive. After all, he was having a back problem and was only comfortable cutting and flicking... Actually, instead of trying to score runs, Miandad  and even Sohail  sought to score in verbal exchanges... Obviously, that worked to our advantage and the pressure increased when Sohail got out (for 62)... To make it worse, Miandad had a hand in Imran Khans run out... But, what became the last straw for Miandad? I think he decided on that kangaroo-like act after one of my appeals was made with a jump... Initially, we were all taken aback and, then, the captain (Mohammed Azharuddin) complained to David Shepherd. The umpire warned Miandad... But, then, he was always a fighter and... More pointed out. Miandad himself got out not much later (for 40, bowled by Jawagal Srinath) and Pakistan fell 43 short of Indias total of 216 for seven. With three catches, More was superb  both with the gloves and verbally. That match (on March 4), by the way, began the sequence of four successive World Cup wins over Pakistan. The 1992 edition, though, was won by Imrans men. Incidentally, it was held just months after the ICC introduced a Code of Conduct and began posting Match Referees. Talking about sledging in general, More opined: Look, a bit of sledging has to be there or else maaza nahin aaye ga... But, yes, it must never be personal nor should there be a racist touch... Asked who sledged the most in his era (1986-1993), More laughed: Miandad has to be at the top... Sohail and Aaquib Javed were the other Pakistanis... Did I sledge? I did and the gloves came in handy... I used them tactically... Among teammates, Manoj Prabhakar did quite a bit... If you ask me, no matter what, a bit of sledging will always be there... According to More, neither an Imran Khan nor a Kapil Dev took to sledging.  Copyright

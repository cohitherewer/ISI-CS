 Chandan wrecks Bihar
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: Off-spinner Chandan Paul (5/44) helped Bengal bowl out Bihar for a paltry 108 on the opening day of the three-day under-15 Polly Umrigar Trophy league match at the Keenan Stadium on Tuesday. In reply, Bengal were 13 without loss with Rohan Bannerji and Srivats Goswami at the wicket. Opting to bat first, Bihar started sedately as Sonal Roy and skipper Rajeev Rao negotiated the medium pace duo of Ritam Porel and Avik Adhikari with comfort. Soft drives and quick singles flowed smoothly before Paul took the ball. He and left-armer Soumya Pakre wove a web around the Bihar batsmen. Roy played early to a Paul delivery to be caught at mid-on. He scored nine and added 30 for the first wicket with Rao. Bihar lost wickets in a heap after lunch with Ajit Dwiwedi the first to go. BRIEF SCORES Bihar 108 (Rajeev Rao 28; Chandan Paul 5/44, Santanu Das 2/18). Bengal 13/0.  Copyright

				 																																	Indianapolis: IRL driver Tony Renna was killed in a wreck during testing at Indianapolis motor speedway after he lost control, went airborne and crashed into a fence.				 																																	The accident which occurred on Wednesday ended the promising career of the 26-year-old Renna, who joined the Indy Racing League as a substitute driver and moved up to major auto racing with an impressive performance in the Indianapolis 500. Tony Renna was a rising star in Indy car racing. All of us involved in racing feel a great loss, said Tony George, president of the IRL.				 																																	London: Britains Davis Cup team will be captained by Jeremy Bates from next year, the Lawn Tennis Association said on Thursday. Bates, head of performance at the LTA, will replace Roger Taylor whose contract runs out at the end of 2003. Britain were relegated to the second tier of the mens team tennis competition this year and Bates first task will be to guide his team to victory over Finland or Luxembourg next April to earn a chance at returning to the top flight.				 																																	London: Englands Football Association (FA) has scrapped a Thursday deadline to deal with the case of Rio Ferdinands missed drugs test. The England defender missed the random test last month. He has since denied using drugs.				 																																	In the interests of all parties concerned and football in general, the FA will proceed through all of the facts with due diligence before making any decision as to what further steps within the process may be, the FA said in a statement onThursday. Therefore we will not be setting any deadlines as to when The FA will make any announcement.				 																																	Munich: Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer has vowed to hand over the 10,000-euro wager he had with Lyon striker Giovane Elber whether the Brazilian forward scores against his former club or not. The pair, old friends from their time at the Olympic Stadium, placed a bet that Elber would not score in either of the two Champions League ties between Lyon and Bayern Munich. 				 																																	But Beckenbauer insists he will pay up regardless, with Elber set to use the money for a good cause in his homeland. Giovane will get the 10,000 euros from me even if he doesnt score against us, Beckenbauer announced.Elber failed to score in Lyons 1-1 draw with Bayern on Tuesday. 				 																																	Birmingham: Turkey defender Alpay, under fire for goading David Beckham during Englands ill-tempered Euro 2004 qualifier in Istanbul, is quitting Aston Villa. He had earned the tag as the most unpopular player in England for riling Beckham after the Real Madrid midfielders penalty miss and again on the way into the changing rooms.				 																																	 n Rugby, World Cup  Live from 1 pm on ESPN n Cricket, India vs NZ  Highlights from 8.30 pm on ESPN n Cricket, Bangladesh vs England  1st Test, Day IV,live from 8.55 am on STAR Sports

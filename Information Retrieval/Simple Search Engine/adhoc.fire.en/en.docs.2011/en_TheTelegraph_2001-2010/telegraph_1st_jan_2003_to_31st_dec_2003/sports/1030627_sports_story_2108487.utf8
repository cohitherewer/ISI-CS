 BCCI defends investigation
 - THE AZHARUDDIN CASE Hyderabad: The BCCI Thursday informed a city civil court that though the decision to hold preliminary inquiry into match-fixing allegations against former captain Mohammed Azharuddin was based on newspaper reports, regular inquiry was based on the findings of the preliminary inquiry. Though newspaper reports cannot be relied upon in matters of this nature, they cannot also be brushed aside as insignificant as they create awareness among the people, BCCI counsel informed second additional chief judge, hearing the suit filed by Azharuddin challenging his life ban from cricket. Stating that a widespread malafide campaign was unleashed against BCCI for its failure to maintain the dignity of Test cricket, the counsel said the Board could not brush aside the allegations. It is an issue of wide public interest and hence BCCI was compelled to order a preliminary inquiry, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Brett Lee to repeat World Cup strategy 
 Brett Lee hopes the MCG wicket will be fast Sydney: Brett Lee has plans to welcome Indias batsmen to the Melbourne Cricket Ground with a pace assault similar to the one that fetched him good results in the World Cup. I have got my plans for how to bowl to India. I will try to use the same approach I used in the World Cup, Lee said in the Sun Herald. There are a couple of different tactics and strategies I use against their (Indian) batsmen, which I am not going to give away. It worked at the World Cup and I will not be bowling too dissimilar to that. It would be fair to say that I am bowling back at top pace, like I was before I got injured. Obviously the body has been the key issue for me and it has come up trumps. As each game has gone on it has just got better and better. Lee, who missed the first two Tests due to injury, said his pace was certainly back and he was ready to take on a resurgent India now. I know I am ready to play, I hope I have proved that in the last couple of games. What has been asked of me I hope I have achieved, Lee said. Looking forward to the Melbourne Test beginning on December 26, Lee said: It is the greatest Test to play in, the Boxing Day Test, and hopefully the wicket will be fast. It will be good for my first game back to have a nice hard, fast wicket to bowl on.  (PTI)  Copyright

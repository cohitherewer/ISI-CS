The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Govt to consider ground realities 
New Delhi: Union sports minister Vikram Verma said on Tuesday that the government will have to consider the ground realities before taking any decision on resuming cricketing ties with Pakistan. They (Pakistan) dont have any control over the terrorists. So, we will have to see the ground realities and their attitude and consider all the aspects (before taking any decision), Verma told a television channel. Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MP and former India manager, Rajiv Shukla, said: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will soon be requesting the Prime Minister to consider a proposal regarding staging of bilateral series in a neutral venue. [According to information available with The Telegraph, though, the BCCI has already sought the governments nod on playing at a neutral venue. In fact, this was reported in these columns on March 20.] Shukla said the BCCI was taking whatever steps possible to revive the cricketing ties between the two countries. The BCCI is quite serious in reviving cricketing ties. But we are waiting for the Centres nod, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

 ICC asks for video footage
Faisalabad: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has asked the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to provide video footage of Sundays spat between South Africa allrounder Andrew Hall and Pakistans Yousuf Youhana. The pair clashed during Pakistans innings in the second ODI in Lahore on Sunday. Television replays suggested Hall had barged into Youhana as he was taking a single. Hall then confronted the batsman, touching his bat and thrusting his face into Youhanas, who responded angrily before umpire Nadeem Ghouri stepped between the players. The two were cautioned by umpire Darrell Hair. We have been asked to provide video footage of the whole match, PCB Chief Executive Rameez Raja said on Tuesday. The impression we have got is that the ICC is to investigate the incident, he said. The Pakistan team did not file a complaint to Match Referee Clive Lloyd and neither umpire reported it. Under the ICCs Code of Conduct, if an incident is not reported to the Match Referee, the chief executive has five days from the close of play on the day the incident took place to lay a charge against a player or official. The ICC said it would wait until it received a full report from the Match Referee and would also review the available footage of the incident before any decision.  Security stepped up Meanwhile, the already-high security around South African cricketers was further boosted after the assassination of a religious leader prompted violent riots, with fears the visitors could be targeted, officials said. The tourists, already swamped by Presidential-style security, were given extra squads of army troops. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Difficult to stay on: Del Bosque 
 Vicente del Bosque Barcelona, June 14 (Reuters): Real Madrid coach Vicente del Bosque suspects he will not be offered a new contract by the Spanish club. We all have our feelings and my intuition is that I wont be staying on, that it will be difficult to stay on, Del Bosque said in a radio interview with Cadena Cope. Real have put off making a decision over whether to offer Del Bosque a new contract at the end of the season. Del Bosques side are still in the running for the Spanish title, a point behind Real Sociedad with two games to play, but the coach fears the worst. I want to carry on at Real Madrid but if at this stage no decision has been made you have to draw conclusions, he said. Speculation is rife that Arsenals French manager Arsene Wenger will move over to Madrid to take charge of the Spanish powerhouse. Nothing, however, has been finalised.  Italian Super Cup Meanwhile, Juventus and AC Milan are set to repeat last months Champions League final showdown in America when they compete for the Italian Super Cup at the New York Giants Stadium on August 3. The decision to hold the match outside Italy was reported by La Gazzetta dello Sport on Saturday. It will be the third time for the Super Cup final to be staged abroad. In 1993, Milan beat Torino in Washington. Last year, Juventus defeated Parma 2-1 in the Libyan capital Tripoli. The decision marries marketing strategy with convenience. Both sides had already scheduled pre-season friendlies in America against Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United at the end of July as Europes top teams try to break into the lucrative US market.

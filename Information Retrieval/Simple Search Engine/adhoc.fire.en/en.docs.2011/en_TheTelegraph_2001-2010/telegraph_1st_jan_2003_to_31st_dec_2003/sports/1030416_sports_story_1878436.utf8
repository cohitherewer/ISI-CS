 Bracewell opts out of race
London: New Zealander John Bracewell, currently director of cricket at County Gloucestershire, has ruled himself out of the running to be Sri Lankas new coach. Bracewell had been short-listed alongside Australian Steve Rixon and former South Africa coach Graham Ford for the post soon to be vacated by Dav Whatmore. But on Tuesday, Bracewell said: I thanked Sri Lanka for their interest but the timing is not right for me. I was flattered to be ranked in such company as Rixon and Graham, who have strong international reputations. But I feel obligated to continue with the team for at least this season. I cant wait to get to work in the mornings and I have been delighted with the attitude of the players in pre-season. I am also excited about working with Jonty Rhodes and learning from that. The main issue of all was the family one. I would probably have had to live apart from them while the contract with Sri Lanka was on and I did not want that. Sri Lanka last week appointed their former captain Duleep Mendis as interim coach while they look for Whatmores successor. The Sri Lanka-born Australian, who helped the island win the World Cup, has been told his contract will not be renewed in June but remains in charge until then.  (AFP)  Copyright

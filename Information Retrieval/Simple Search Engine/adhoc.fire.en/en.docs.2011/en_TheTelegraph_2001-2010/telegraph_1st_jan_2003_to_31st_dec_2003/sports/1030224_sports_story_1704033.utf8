The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ manager reads the riot act
Johannesburg: New Zealand team manager Jeff Crowe has warned his World Cup squad to drastically improve their behaviour after the Durban nightclub brawl which brought shame on the team and left star allrounder Chris Cairns nursing cuts as well as his battered pride. Crowe confirmed he has given all 15 players a note which made mention of the fact they are high-profile sportsmen, their responsibilities in public and how they can be vulnerable in certain situations. Crowe said he had a one-on-one meeting with Cairns, whose memories of the assault were understood to be hazy. Cairns said he had been told his South African partner Carin was pregnant with their second child and was apparently out to celebrate, a news agency reported. Nine players were in the Tiger, Tiger club in Durban in the early hours of Friday morning when trouble broke out between them and local revellers. Crowe was to forward his review to NZC chief executive Martin Snedden in Christchurch who will determine what should be done next. The incident was disappointing and pretty disruptive at this stage of the campaign, said Crowe as the squad headed for Kimberley where they face Bangladesh Wednesday. It will be their first match in ten days after they decided to boycott their game in Kenya because of security fears.  (AFP)  Copyright

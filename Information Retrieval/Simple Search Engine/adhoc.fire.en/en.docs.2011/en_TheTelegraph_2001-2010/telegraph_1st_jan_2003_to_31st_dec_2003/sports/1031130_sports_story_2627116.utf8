The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Daniels 111 as Lanka A hit 255
Pune, Nov. 29 (PTI): A sparkling 111 by Ian Daniel and a 64 by Jehan Mubarak helped Sri Lanka A pile up 255 for three on the opening day of their four-day match versus India A at the Nehru Stadium here Saturday. Electing to bat, the visitors got off to a good start with the openers recording a century stand before Prasanna Jayawardene (40) was caught by Gautam Gambhir off Amit Bhandari. But Daniel, joined by Mubarak, continued to play the attack with ease.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan put Bhaichung on notice 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  BHAICHUNG: Far from impressive Calcutta: It has been a sorry saga for Mohun Bagan throughout the season. With nothing to play for except a bit of pride, the green-and-maroon brigade take on Tollygunge Agragami Monday. Though inconsequential for the outcome of the league, the game can be a bit of an acid test for Bhaichung Bhutia. The striker has been far from impressive this season and Bagan officials want to see him in the last three games before taking a final decision on whether or not to retain him for the next season. He hasnt performed and we will see how he does in these games, a senior Mohun Bagan club official said. And with East Bengal announcing that their doors are shut for the mercurial striker, its crunch time for the former Bury FC player. However, perhaps blissfully oblivious of such growing discontent about his inputs, Bhaichung, along with Rennedy Singh, skipped the team practice on the match-eve. The coach Subrata Bhattacharya, though, said that they would play. Bagan will be without George Ekeh and Satish Bharti, both nursing injuries. We lost to them in the first leg, lets see if some pride can be restored, the coach said of Sundays opponents.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zia: ACC has no future
 - Peeved PCB chief likely to meet Dalmiya in Dubai  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  General Zia Calcutta: The Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments refusal to allow strictly bilateral cricket exchanges isnt the only reason why the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has opted out of the Asia Cup, scheduled for August 10-28 in Sri Lanka. Initially, of course, the tournament was to be hosted by Pakistan. Ironically, the PCB decision came after New Delhi cleared the Board of Control for Cricket In Indias (BCCIs) Asia Cup-file. Look, thats been the top  but not the sole  consideration. There have been a series of events, PCB chief Lt General Tauqir Zia told The Telegraph, Wednesday evening. In fact, Indias participation in the on-going tri-series in Bangladesh, too, has somewhat irked the PCB. Even though India should have visited us after the World Cup, the BCCI made the Bangladesh commitment well over a year ago How do you expect us to react? What do I tell people in Pakistan? asked a distinctly peeved General Zia, when contacted in Rawalpindi. He continued: It was on the understanding that India would play Pakistan in a Test series, even if that be on neutral territory, that we agreed to forego our chance of hosting the tournament. But, when even that isnt materialising, why should Pakistan play at all? After all, its known that Indias no to a bilateral series is hurting the PCB. Its not insignificant that Pakistan supremo General Pervez Musharraf, the PCB patron, is himself very keen on the resumption of cricket ties. Besides the jinxed Asia Cup which, by the way, has seen more postponements than editions  Team India should (by now) have featured in a Test series in Pakistan. But, then, bilateral exchanges have been actively discouraged post-Kargil (mid-1999) onwards. According to General Zia, the PCB hasnt also taken kindly to the manner in which the Islamabad-based Zakir Hussain Syed was treated when he sought to visit Calcutta for an Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meeting last December. Syed, the ACC-appointed Development Manager for the continent, couldnt make the trip as the Indian High Commission made it known he wouldnt exactly be welcome. General Zia added Pakistan would even go unrepresented in the U-17 Asia Cup, slated to be hosted by India at the year-end. There was talk of staging an Asian schools meet in Mumbai around this time but, from what I understand, the idea was shelved as our boys wouldnt have got visas It wasnt a BCCI event, but such things leave a very bad taste, he insisted. With the PCB retaliating in the fashion it has, the ACCs very existence is now at stake. Actually, General Zia bluntly remarked it has no future. It cant, unless India and Pakistan join hands. Incidentally, General Zia and BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya should interact with each other in Dubai (during an Asian Cricket Foundation session), on May 3, and a compromise isnt an impossibility. For now, however, General Zia is firm on not backtracking. He has compulsions. Dalmiyas hands, too, are tied.  Copyright

 West Indies out on Mission 418
- Final test l Hayden (177), Langer (111) set the platform for huge lead with 242-run stand Matthew Hayden, who scored 177 in the second innings St Johns: Matthew Hayden scored 177 and fellow-opener Justin Langer 111 as Australia built a substantial second-innings lead in the fourth and final Test against the West Indies Sunday.The West Indies, chasing 418 to avoid a rare home series whitewash, were 10 without loss at 2 am. Australia were earlier all out for 417 with skipper Steve Waugh remaining unbeaten on 45. Glenn McGrath (14) was the last man to be dismissed. Mervyn Dillon was the most successful bowler with four for 112. Vasbert Drakes took two for 92 and Omari Banks two for 153.The home team enjoyed a revival, taking seven wickets for 140 runs once they dismissed Langer, but by then the damage had already been done by the first-wicket partnership of 242.Australia reached 382 for seven by tea on the third day. Captain Steve Waugh was on 26 and Jason Gillespie on three. Both teams made 240 in their first innings.The West Indies will have to score their highest-ever fourth innings total against Australia to stop the visitors from becoming the first side to achieve a clean sweep in the Caribbean.The highest fourth innings score the West Indies have achieved against the tourists is 352 in Sydney in 1969. The West Indies did score 311 for nine to win the third Test in Bridgetown in 1999.Hayden survived two chances before reaching his 14 Test century early Sunday. He was dropped by captain Brian Lara at first slip off Omari Banks Saturday when he was on 47 and had another let-off on 88 when Devon Smiths throw just missed the stumps.Langer brought up his 15th century shortly after, but after reaching 111 he edged Chris Gayle to Lara at first slip.Adam Gilchrist was sent in at number three but made only six before being caught by Marlon Samuels off Banks after the ball ricocheted off Ridley Jacobs shoulder.The West Indies made another breakthrough when Banks and Samuels again combined to remove Martin Love for two on the last ball of the morning session.Hayden continued his onslaught after lunch, hitting a huge six off Banks on to the roof of the Richie Richardson stand before smashing the next delivery down the ground for four.Mervyn Dillon then bowled Darren Lehmann, who got an inside edge on to his stumps for 14, before Hayden was run out after Waugh played a shot to backward point, and Carlton Baugh had a direct hit after Hayden had been sent back by Waugh.Dillon, who was dropped for the third Test, grabbed another two wickets in the afternoon session when he had Bichel caught by Devon Smith for a duck and Brett Lee by substitute Sylvester Joseph for 18.On Saturday, Australia were denied a first-innings lead for the first time in the series courtesy a flamboyant 68 by Lara, who hit 12 fours and a six. Laras cavalier style ultimately led to his downfall as he drove Andy Bichel straight to Langer at mid-off, having hit the previous three balls for four. Lara signalled his intentions early with a six over point off Brett Lee to get off the mark.  Copyright

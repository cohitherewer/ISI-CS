Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: East Bengal and JCT recorded their maiden victories in the under-19 National Football League Thursday. The red-and-gold brigade defeated Indian Bank 3-0 while Tollygunge Agragami went down to JCT by a solitary goal. In their opening matches Tuesday, Tollygunge had held East Bengal goalless, while Indian Bank and JCT also played out a barren tie. East Bengal dominated proceedings in a one-sided affair at their home ground. Kartik Kisku put them ahead three minutes before the breather. In the second session, substitute Surajit Bose and Bipul Hansda increased the margin. At the Mohammedan Sporting ground, JCT were in total control against the city team. It was only late in the second session that Tollygunge managed to make a few moves into the rival territory. JCT scored the winner in the 22nd minute through Mandeep Kumar, whose snap shot from the top of the box beat the goalkeeper. Tollygunge came close to equalising in the 83rd minute but Raj Kumar fumbled at the last minute. Salgaocar have it easy PTI adds: In Margao, Salgaocar rode Meleish DCostas brace to a fluent 3-1 victory over Churchill Brothers. Churchill had surged ahead in the 14th minute, when a Bango free kick deflected off the leg of defender Minguel Peisco and beat keeper Gerard to find the net. DCosta restored parity in the 34th minute. Rajesh Patil scored the other goal for Salgaocar.  Copyright

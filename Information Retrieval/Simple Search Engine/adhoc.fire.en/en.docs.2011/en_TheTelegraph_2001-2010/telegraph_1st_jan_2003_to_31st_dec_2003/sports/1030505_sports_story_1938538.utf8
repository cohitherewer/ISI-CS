The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mohammedan Sporting back in business
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: With their maiden entry into the National Football Leagues (NFLs) premier division, the winds of change are now blowing across Mohammedan Sporting Club. This was evident on Sunday, when the club held its first Annual General Meeting (AGM) in two decades, amid promise of forming a formidable team for the season. About 300 club members were present and reflected more on developing a better team than on the audit and other usual elements associated with an AGM. We have decided to set up an NFL fund and each club members will contribute Rs. 200 to it. We have also decided to firm up our relationship with the UK-based marketing agent, FMM International regarding sponsors. We are all looking forward to a better and healthier Mohammedan Sporting, club secretary Sultan Ahmed said. It was also planned in the AGM to have a football academy for the club, a la Mohun Bagan, and the officials are looking for land in Howrah. Meanwhile, the club has decided to release Arunava Sarkar and all foreigners except Habeeb Adekunle. Ahmed also said they are not so sure about retaining the striking duo of Dipendu Biswas and Rahim Nabi.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Portuguese deal by AIFF
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The AIFFs Goan connection (in secretary Albert Colaco) is paying good dividends. On Sunday, at an executive committee meeting of the federation in New Delhi, a decision for action was taken on an MoU with a number of Portuguese organisations for tech-transfer. Colaco said here Monday that the deal to be signed between the AIFF on the one hand, and the Portuguese Olympic Committee, the Portuguese national football federation, the University of Porto and Club Victoria (a mid-level Portuguese premier division outfit) on the other, and it envisages that three Indian junior players and a coach can spend two months each year at Club Victoria, soaking in soccer at that level. It also envisages that technical people of the Portuguese federation will visit India for tech support, so to say. The cost of the three kids and the coach in Portugal will be borne by the Portuguese consortium, while the travel is the AIFFs. When the technical delegation comes to India, we host him, said Colaco. The deal was struck during a recent visit of the Portuguese Olympic committee and Club Victoria heads to Goa, Colaco said. While it was originally decided that the kids (to go in March) will be selected from the current under-17 team, their poor performance on Monday (versus Nepal) now sees national chief coach Stephen Constantine due to watch Subroto Cup matches for other probables.

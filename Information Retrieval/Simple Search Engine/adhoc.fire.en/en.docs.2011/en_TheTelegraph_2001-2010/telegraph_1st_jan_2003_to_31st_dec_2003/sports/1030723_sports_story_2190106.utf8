 Brian Lara, who led his country to commendable performances against Australia and Sri Lanka, was named his countrys Cricketer of the Year.On the strength of his bat, Lara also contributed to victories for Trinidad and Tobago in the Carib Beer series, making him the clear favourite for the honour given by the Trinidad and Tobago cricket board.Ravi Rampaul, who holds the record for the most wickets in a regional youth series, was named Young Cricketer smashed his winners trophy from Sundays British Formula One Grand Prix, the Brazilian Ferrari driver said when he arrived here on Monday. Somebody bumped into the trophy and it fell and broke. Im upset but I hope I can get another one, he said. Barrichello said the trophy was smashed when four-yearly football tournament, the Asian Cup, will be shunted forward by one year starting from 2007 to avoid fixture congestion, organisers said.The showpiece competition will be held in China next year, and under the old schedule the edition after that would have taken place in 2008, a statement said. But a desire to give the tournament a free slot in the crowded international calendar has prompted the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) to move the competitions gold medal winner Carl Lewis may avoid going to jail for drunken driving charges stemming from a freeway crash in his new sports car, his lawyer said Monday. Jail time is always a potential. Do I think its realistic? No, said lawyer Mark Rafferty.It is the first time that Lewis has been charged with driving under the influence, Rafferty said. Under the driving under influence law, Lewis could get up to six of a deal to sign Argentine centre-back Gabriel Milito from Independiente because of concerns over the players fitness. Real agreed the signing of Milito on a four-year contract last week but his planned presentation was postponed from Friday after the club said they needed more time to carry out extra medical tests.On Monday, Real offered the player a one-year loan deal instead but failed to reach out of forthcoming tournaments in San Diego and Los Angeles due an abdominal injury that she re-aggravated at Wimbledon, WTA Tour officials said on Monday.The fourth-ranked Williams  who lost in the Wimbledon final to her sister, Serena  first sustained an abdominal tear when playing a tournament in Warsaw in April.Sport on screen

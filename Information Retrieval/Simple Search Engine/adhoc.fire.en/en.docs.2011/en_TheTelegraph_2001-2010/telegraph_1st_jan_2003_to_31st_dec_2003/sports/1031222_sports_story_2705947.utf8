The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Clarke steals the show on final day
	 - Rising star hits unbeaten 131 in drawn match  Akash Chopra pulls one in Hobart on Sunday. He made 25 in the Indian second innings. (AFP) Hobart: Opener Sadagopan Ramesh failed with the bat yet again even as the three-day match between India and Australia A ended in a dreary draw here on Sunday. Southpaw Ramesh, who opened the innings with Akash Chopra, followed his first innings score of four with 22 in the second. He was caught hooking at square leg. India, chasing 308 in 41 overs for a win, were 66 for two at close at the Bellerive Oval. Deep Dasgupta was batting on 19 and Parthiv Patel was yet to open his account when the two captains  Sourav Ganguly and Michael Hussey  agreed for a draw after 33 overs into the visitors second innings. Chopra, who made 25, was the other Indian wicket to fall on the final day. Chopra, doing the team a good turn with his defensive batting, was excruciatingly slow on Sunday during his 98-ball knock. He was at the crease for 129 minutes for his 25. Chopra was finally out in the sixth mandatory over when he edged medium-fast bowler Paul Rofe to wicketkeeper Wade Seecombe. The day truly belonged to Australias rising star Michael Clarke who made 131 from 140 balls in four hours of batting, smacking 12 fours and four sixes. Australia A declared their second innings at 241 for seven after their first six wickets had fallen cheaply. Clarke reached his hundred by clouting left-arm spinner Murali Kartik over mid-wicket for a six. He then hit another four and a six in the same over as the hosts made a dash towards declaring their innings. Resuming at 57 for three, Australia A struggled in the first session, losing Brad Hodge (33), who was bowled by Irfan Pathan. Then Dasgupta picked up a superb catch at square leg off Ashish Nehra to send Cameron White (5) packing. Balaji took his third wicket of the innings when he induced an edge from Matthew Nicholson (7) into the hands of wicketkeeper Patel. Clarke was the guiding light for the hosts as Balaji (three for 87) and Pathan (two for 40) did the star turn for the visitors. When the Indians began their second innings, they were never on the hunt even though Ramesh played a few cracking boundaries during his half-an-hour stay at the crease. Chopra, on the other hand, hardly bothered to keep the scoreboard ticking as he took quite some time to settle down against some fiery bowling. In fact, when Ramesh got out  caught by Hussey off Damien Wright in the 10th over  Chopra was yet to open his account. Dasgupta, who came in following Rameshs dismissal, also batted slowly as India progressed at a snails pace before Chopra was dismissed in the 32nd over. The opener offered a simple catch to Seecombe with India on 66. Patel joined Dasgupta in the middle. But the pint-sized wicketkeeper-batsman was hardly tested as the match was called off just after nine balls. Besides left-hander Ramesh, Kartiks performance in the match must have come as a disappointment for the team management as the left-arm spinner is a strong contender for a place in the side for the Boxing Day Test starting in Melbourne from Friday. Kartik, who was flown in as reinforcement after the first Test in Brisbane, hardly troubled the batsmen, managing just two wickets in the match. He suffered the most at the hands of Clarke in the second innings, where he conceded 53 runs in 12 overs for his only scalp.  (PTI)  Copyright

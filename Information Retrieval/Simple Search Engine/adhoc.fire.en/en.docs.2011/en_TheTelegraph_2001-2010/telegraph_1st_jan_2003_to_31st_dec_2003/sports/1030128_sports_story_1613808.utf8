The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, January 28, 2003 				 Bagan to go all out
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 				 	 EKEH																								Calcutta: For defending champions Mohun Bagan, it is time to consolidate as they seek to put a forgettable first phase in the National Football League behind them. The way they routed Indian Bank 4-0 Saturday, Subrata Bhattacharyas men showed that they meant business. 																								For Dempo SC, their top priority has already been achieved. As coach Armando Colaco put it, they wanted to make sure the team retains its place in next seasons competition. Almost halfway through the tournament, Dempo are in second position and very much safe. 																								Tuesdays Calcutta-Goa clash at Salt Lake Stadium will be fought from different perspectives. While Mohun Bagan will be eyeing full points, Colaco sounded philosophical Monday. My team will play for entertainment. I dont mind if we win, draw or lose the match in doing so, the Dempo coach quipped. 																								Subrata, however, was least interested in what his opponents were thinking on the eve of the match. See, tomorrow is our home match and nothing less than a win will satisfy me, he said Monday morning. 																								Attention will also be on Jose Ramirez Barreto, who scored his hundredth goal for Mohun Bagan the other day. Barreto and George Ekeh, hero of the last match, will be Subratas trump cards. Palash Karmakar will replace an injured Lolendra Singh.

 Railways drub Bengal
Chennai: Bengal suffered their second loss in the national one-day tournament, going down to Railways by ten wickets Sunday. After putting up a commendable 265 in 50 overs, the Bengal bowlers failed to make any impression with Tejinder Pal Singh (156 n.o.) and Amit Pagnis (103 n.o.) notching up the required runs in 35.2 overs. Earlier, Prasenjit Ganguly (45) and Devang Gandhi (63) were involved in a 95-run second wicket partnership.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Order of Merit title for Atwal
 Atwal finished 57th, but still claimed the award New Delhi: A lacklustre performance notwithstanding, Arjun Atwal annexed the Asian PGA Order of Merit title at the season-ending Volvo Masters of Asia golf tournament in Bangkok Sunday to add yet another feather to his cap this year. Atwal, who last week became the only Indian ever to qualify for the US PGA Tour, finished the lowest among the Indians in fray at the $ 500,000 event played at par-71 Bangkok Golf Club course at tied 57th and a three-day aggregate of four-over 288. Atwals only real threat to the Order of Merit title, Chinas Zhang Lian Wei finished tied 39th at 281, according to information received here. It is the second time in a row that an Indian took home the coveted title as Jyoti Randhawa had achieved the feat last season. Randhawa may have not been able to defend his crown but he did outshine Atwal with his performance Sunday a card of six-under 65 in the final round and a tournament tally of 15-under 269 which placed him third on the leaderboard. He pocketed a cheque of $ 30,000. American Ted Purdy emerged the winner with a four-day score of 19-under 265 while Lin Keng-chi of Taipei finished second one stroke behind the leader. Among the other Indians in fray, Chandigarhs Harmeet Kahlon fired a three-under 68 to finish tied for seventh position at 11-under 273. Amandeep Johl at tied-13th, finished two strokes behind Harmeet at nine-under 275. Arjun Singh with a 69 Sunday, tallied two-over 286 for the tied-51st place. India-born Swede Daniel Chopra, who also earned a US PGA Tour card last week at the pga tour qualifiers, finished tied-32nd at five-under 279. Randhawa, who broke par on each of the four days and never once moved out of the top-ten, reserved his best for the last day. His round of six-under 65, was a superb effort but not without incident. The 31-year old carded birdies early on in his round, on the third and fourth. The fifth hole, however, witnessed him return his third double bogey of the tournament. The remainder of Randhawas round comprised of birdies on the sixth, seventh, eighth, 12th, 15th, 17th and 18th interspersed by a lone bogey on the 13th. Kahlon had birdies on the fourth, eighth, 12th, 13th and 18th, while he dropped shots on the 11th ad 17th for a 68. Harmeet was richer by $ 10,317, while his city-mate Amandeep Johl pocketed $ 6,971. Arjun Singh took home $ 2,200. Atwal had a dream start with an eagle on the par-five opening hole. Birdies on the third and ninth placed him at four under on the tenth tee, but the Calcutta pro dropped his first and only shot of the day on that hole to finish with a card of 68 to earn $ 1,825.

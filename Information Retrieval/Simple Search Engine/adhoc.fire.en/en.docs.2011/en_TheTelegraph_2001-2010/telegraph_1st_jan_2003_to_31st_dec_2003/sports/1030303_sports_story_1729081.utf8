The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Namibia, Holland look for first win
Bloemfontein: While the World Cup giants talk of the Super Six, Namibia and Holland are thinking only of surviving the embarrassment of the Group A wooden spoon. With five heavy defeats each, both sides are desperate to clinch their first World Cup win and Mondays match at Goodyear Park is their last opportunity to break their ducks. We have been very competitive against the top sides in terms of fielding and bowling and we have just got to keep the same disciplines, said Namibia skipper Deon Kotze. The biggest mistake would be to think that we have done the hard work and relax against the Dutch. The Namibians must bounce back from the 256-run mauling they received at the hands of the Australians last week  a record defeat in World Cup history. But they showed against England that they do have players who can take the game to the opposition. For the Dutch, playing in their second World Cup, they took a degree of comfort from passing 200 as they chased 301 against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo before losing by 99 runs. We were pleased to get beyond 200 against Zimbabwe, said Holland skipper Roland Lefebrve. Now we need to win against Namibia and I think we have a very good chance if we bowl well and perform solidly.

 Mauresmo seals triumph
 Mary Pierce and Amelie Mauresmo after Frances Fed Cup triumph in Moscow on Sunday. (AFP) Moscow: Amelie Mauresmo crushed American Meghann Shaughnessy 6-2, 6-1 on Sunday to power France to their second Fed Cup title. The world number fours easy victory gave the French an unassailable 3-0 lead over a US team missing several top players. Emilie Loit later made it 4-0 after beating Alexandra Stevenson 6-4, 6-2. After clinching the tie Mauresmo, in tears, ran off court to embrace French captain Guy Forget. Yes, I was crying because it was a very emotional moment, the 24-year-old said afterwards. The Americans, playing in their 26th final, were chasing a record 18th Fed Cup crown. France led 2-0 lead after the first day, with Mauresmo beating Lisa Raymond and Mary Pierce overcoming Meghann Shaughnessy 6-3, 3-6, 8-6. On Sunday, Mauresmo dominated Shaughnessy right from the outset, breaking her opponent twice in the first set and three more times in the second to close out the match in just 60 minutes. The French victory was especially sweet for Forget, who became the second person to lead his country to both Davis and Fed Cup titles, repeating the feat of compatriot Yannick Noah. Noah captained France to their first Fed Cup crown in 1997 when they beat The Netherlands 4-1 in the final. Forget, who first won the Davis Cup as a player in 1991 with Noah as coach, also captained France to the title 10 years later. (Reuters)  Copyright

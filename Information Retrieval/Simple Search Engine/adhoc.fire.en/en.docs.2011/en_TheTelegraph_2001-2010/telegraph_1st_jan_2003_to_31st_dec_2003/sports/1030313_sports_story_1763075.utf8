The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pitch to be re-examined
Durban: The St Georges Park pitch in Port Elizabeth, where Australia have twice come from behind to win low-scoring matches against England and New Zealand, will be re-examined ahead of the first World Cup semi-final there. The Super Six toppers will face the No. 4 team in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday. The awkward bounce has troubled batsmen a lot and there are fears the semi-final game might turn out to be a staid affair on a wicket which is not true. The Cricket World Cup committee (CWC), already bothered by the waning interest following the ouster of the host nation in the league round, has decided to take up the matter and examine if there is really any problem in the wicket. CWC media liaison officer Rodney Hartman said concerned officials  Hilbert Smit, chairman of the SA cricket groundsmans association, and Brian Basson, director of cricket operations  will travel to Port Elizabeth to oversee preparations for the March 18 semi-final.

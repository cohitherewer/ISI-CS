The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Souravs smile reflects his inner  strength
 - The Kenyans have shown what a team  with good attitude and spirit can achieve BY GREG CHAPPELL Yuvraj Singh (left)  and Ashish Nehra celebrate Indias victory over Kenya  in the World Cup semi-final in Durban Thursday  The smile was evident on the face  of Sourav Ganguly on a number of occasions during Indias  semi-final match against Kenya at Kingsmead Thursday. It  first appeared on winning the toss and was on display often  during the latter stages of match as he led his team from  the front. We have not seen the smile much  in recent times, for obvious reasons, and it reflects the  much better state of mind Sourav finds himself in now. He  may well smile as his team has shown resilience, courage  and poise and gone from strength to strength since the setback  against Australia early in the tournament. The most positive aspect of what  has been achieved is that it has been a team effort. No  doubt the senior players such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav,  Rahul Dravid and Jawagal Srinath have played important roles,  but the improvement shown by the young guns, Zaheer Khan,  Ashish Nehra and Yuvraj Singh has been the most exciting  part of Indias campaign. They were all on show in the predictable  victory over Kenya, although the rain did add a little anxiety  to what was not much more than a walk in the park for the  powerful Indian team.  Having won the toss and electing  to bat first on a wicket that a more experienced attack  may have made more use of, the Indian top order embarked  on a circumspect approach that, in the end, paid off handsomely.  Virender Sehwag and Sacin proceeded with caution against  the new ball before Sourav and Sachin laid a formidable  foundation for the tidy total that was always going to be  too much for Steve Tikolos happy band of men. Sachin worked the ball beautifully  as he displayed his surgeons touch. The bludgeon was put  away for another day. Sourav was also cautious early on  before growing in confidence and aggression. Some slight  concerns about the weather no doubt pushed him to up the  run rate in the latter stages. The smiles indicated the  relaxed state of mind the captain is currently enjoying.  Why not? after all he has helped  transform the sorry bunch that arrived in South Africa nearly  six weeks ago into realistic championship contenders. Perhaps  Sourav has finally relaxed into the leader that he is capable  of being. Personal form is another thing  that will have allowed him to relax and having a bowling  attack that can match it with anyone will have helped. Batsmen  can set up wins for you, but it is the bowlers who win matches.  Just look at what Australia has been able to achieve despite  some indifferent batting.  The real test is still to come  for India, but they have done everything necessary in their  last eight games. They have shown commitment to the basic  requirements for success and have shown a strong team spirit.  A captain cannot do much more than that and it helps if  he is able to lead from the front with the bat as Sourav  has done. The Kenyans have shown us what  a team with a good attitude and a good spirit can achieve.  They are not in the same class as the top nations, but they  managed to get to the semi-final because they had a serious  go, and because they wouldnt believe what everyone else  thought.  Tikolo and his team have been  one of the real success stories of this World Cup and some  of the other teams could learn something from their no-frills  approach. The rest of the cricket world has sat up and taken  notice, the ICC now needs to look at what else it can do  to help Kenyan cricket build on this success as they endeavour  to take their cricket to the next stage.  It has taken a seemingly interminable  time to get to the stage we are now at. The two best teams  in the tournament are preparing to shape up at Wanderers  stadium Sunday. A lot of nervous energy has been spent,  and, no doubt, more will be spent before then, but we are  about to find out which of the two is the best ODI team  in the world.  (PTI) Copyright

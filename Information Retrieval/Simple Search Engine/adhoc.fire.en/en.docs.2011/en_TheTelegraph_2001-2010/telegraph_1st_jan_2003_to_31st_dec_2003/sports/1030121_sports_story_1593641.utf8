The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, January 21, 2003 				 ICC set to put Sri Lanka on notice
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Labrooy: Heading back from Australia																								Calcutta: From India, much of the Player Terms action has shifted across the Palk Strait.																								Indeed, the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) business arm, IDI Limited, is preparing to serve a lawyers notice on the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL).																								That could come about as early as Tuesday afternoon.																								Till now (late Monday), the Lankans havent forwarded the Terms and, so, legal provisions will have to be invoked, a well-placed source, based in London, told The Telegraph.																								According to him, the BCCSL has no choice but to immediately follow-up on its 15-strong squad for the World Cup, beginning February 8.																								Though the Sanath Jayasuriya-led squad was announced well before the December 31 cut-off. Not one player has signed the Terms.																								The Lankans are already in breach of the Participating Nation Agreement (PNA) and, irrespective of whether or not the top guns sign, 15 contracts have to be despatched to IDI Ltd, the source added.																								Incidentally, the PNA-deadline ended January 14.																								For its part, the BCCSL has indicated it may pick afresh and eventually send a second-string. Well, such desperation at its Maitland Place HQ is understandable: Failure to offer the best  not the best available  15 could invite claims for compensation from the World Cups sponsors.																								By BCCSL chief executive Anura Tennekoons own admission, the stalemate continues. 																								[In New Delhi, the Delhi High Court reserved its order on the PIL till Wednesday. A division bench, comprising acting Chief Justice Devinder Gupta and Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed, heard the respondents and plaintiffs Monday.]																								Meanwhile, speaking exclusively from Colombo, Sri Lankan Cricketers Association (SLCA) secretary Roshan Mahanama said the picture may become clearer once committee member (and emissary) Graeme Labrooy returned from Australia Tuesday.																								I suppose Graeme will straightaway interact with the BCCSL Sitting across the table is different from talking long-distance or relying on e-mails, Mahanana, who has only just returned from Australia (after a two-month private trip), pointed out.																								Mahanama has himself been out of the loop, as he put it, because of his absence from Lanka. I did a coaches course in Brisbane and, then, some coaching in Melbourne In any case, I hold an honorary post, he remarked.																								Jayasuriya, by the way, is the SLCA president.																								While nobody is speaking of it openly, theres speculation that the BCCSL-players dispute, over the sharing of the financial pie, has something to do with the nasty politicking in that countrys cricket set-up.																								Not for the first time, after all, an interim committee (with Hemaka Amarasuriya) is running the BCCSL and elections in April will see heavyweights Thilanga Sumathipala and Arjuna Ranatunga go for each others jugular.																								For now, however, the ICC is at the BCCSLs throat.																								l Delhi HC hearing report on Page 24

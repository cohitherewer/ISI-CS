The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Federer in last 8 
Rome: Roger Federer brushed aside Tommy Robredo 6-1, 6-1 to reach the quarter finals of the $2.75 million Rome Masters Series Thursday. The fourth-seeded Federer got off to a blistering start, taking the first set in just 19 minutes with his usual arsenal of serve-and-volleying, wily baseline play and effective returns. The 19th-ranked Robredo did not play poorly, but Federer just seemed to be making any shot he wanted to. Federer notched his third consecutive straight-set victory at this claycourt tune-up for the French Open, extending his leading match victory total this season to 34. Third seed Carlos Moya became the latest high-ranking casualty, beaten 4-6, 6-7 by Yevgeny Kafelnikov in Round III. Bhupathi up, Paes out Indian doubles specialists Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes had mixed fortunes. Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi, the second seeds, edged out Argentines Augustin Calleri and Guillermo Coria 7-6, 7-6. Fourth seeds Paes and David Rikl lost 4-6, 3-6 to Federer and Paradorn Srichaphan. Clijsters advances In Berlin, top seed Kim Clijsters battled her way through to the quarter finals of the WTA German Open with a 7-5, 6-3 win over Colombias Fabiola Zuluaga Thursday. Jennifer Capriati advanced to the last eight more comfortably with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Frances Nathalie Dechy.  (AP)  Copyright

 Pakistan clinch series
 - THIRD ODI vs BANGLADESH - Guls five-wicket haul gives hosts 300th ODI victory  Mushfiqur Rahman of Bangladesh tries  to stop a Inzamam-ul-Haq hit during the third ODI in  Lahore on Monday. (AFP)Lahore: Paceman Umer Guls five-wicket haul earned Pakistan a 42-run victory over Bangladesh on Monday, but floodlight failures suspended play twice in the third day-night one-day International at the Gaddafi Stadium. Half centuries by captain Inzamam-ul-Haq (64) and Yousuf Youhana (65) helped Pakistan post a formidable 257 for nine off their 50 overs. Bangladeshs target was revised to 244 off 44 overs  under the Duckworth-Lewis method  after play was halted twice due to malfunctioning of one of the six floodlight towers and 55 minutes of play was lost. Guls five wickets for just 17 runs in nine overs restricted Bangladesh to 201 for nine. The victory not only gave the home team a decisive 3-0 lead in the five-match series, it was also Pakistans 300th ODI win after playing 564 matches. Hannan Sarkar and Alok Kapali both made 61 runs each and added 95 for the fourth wicket. However, the run-rate kept mounting and when Sarkar was bowled by part-time spinner Mohammed Hafeez in the 33rd over, Bangladesh were still 107 runs behind. Sarkar hit five fours. Gul returned for his second spell and removed Kapali and Mashrafe Bin Murtaza to record his best figures in ten ODIs. Kapalis aggressive innings included five fours and a six.  Gul claimed three wickets for  nine runs in his opening spell of seven overs and Bangladesh  slumped to 42 for three in the 13th. Opener Mohammed Ashrafuls  miserable series continued when he was caught by a diving  Inzamam in the slips for second nought in three games. (AFP)  Copyright

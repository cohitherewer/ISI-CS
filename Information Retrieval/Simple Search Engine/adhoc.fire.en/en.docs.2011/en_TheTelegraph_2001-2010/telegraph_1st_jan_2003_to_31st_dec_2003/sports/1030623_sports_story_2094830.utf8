The Telegraph - Calcutta
 LBW experiment from October
New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to come up with an experiment from October to help umpires make correct leg-before decisions. According to ICC cricket manager Dave Richardson, the experiment will see a white line drawn between the stumps at two ends to help umpires determine where exactly the ball pitched and whether the batsman was in line of the stumps. We havent decided whether to use an unbroken or dotted white line. But this is an experiment worth introducing, the former South Africa keeper, said. Richardson said the new method would improve the accuracy rate by another three per cent. The ICC has also decided to introduce the use of earphones connected to stump microphones to help umpires hear the sound of thin edges. There have also been suggestions to increase the number of on field umpires to three. The third official, ICC advocates, will only rule on no-balls to help the remaining two concentrate on batsmen.

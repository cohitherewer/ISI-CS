The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kapils opinion
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Aug. 2: Kapil Dev thinks sledging is not on. You should win on the basis of talent and performance. If you resort to means like sledging, thats unfair, he said. Players like me and (Sunil) Gavaskar played the game in a healthier way, in tune with its lofty spirit. I can understand Gavaskars sentiments. I wholeheartedly support him. If they (Australia) are such a talented side, why do they need to take recourse to sledging? Their performance should be enough, said Kapil, who is here on a promotional tour for Sony Max.

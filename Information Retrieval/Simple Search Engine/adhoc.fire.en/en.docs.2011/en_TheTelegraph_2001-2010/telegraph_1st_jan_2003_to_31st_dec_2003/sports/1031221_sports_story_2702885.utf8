The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anand for rating system review
 - Former world champion says rapid chess points should be considered for main list too  BY ATREYO MUKHOPADHYAY  Viswanathan Anand gives computer lessons to underpriviledged children at a city training centre on Saturday. Picture by Aranya Sen Calcutta, Dec. 20: Viswanathan Anand has had a great year in the shorter version of chess, winning almost everything on offer including the world rapid title. His results in the classical form of the game, though, has not been that exceptional, resulting in a slump in his Elo rating  from 2774 in July to 2766 in October. Talking to The Telegraph here on Saturday, taking a break from his promotional tour for NIIT, the former world champion explained what has caused the slip in the ratings. Anand also spoke in favour of a revision in the rating procedure, while adding he is willing to represent India in the Chess Olympiad next year. There are not too many strong events around the world at the moment from which players like us can gain Elo points. Earlier, there used to be 5-6 such tournaments every year, while now we just have the ones in Wijk aan Zee, Dortmund and Linares. So, I think my dip in ratings is more by accident than by design. But I am not disappointed with my showing in classical events this year. I am happy to have won at Wijk aan Zee and came second and third at Dortmund and Linares, respectively. Dortmund was a nice comeback for me as I had a very bad outing there in 2001. Not that I gained too many points from these events, but the experience was sweet, said Anand. The 34-year-old suggested its time to consider including rapid chess points for the main list. About 80 per cent of total chess in the world at this moment is rapid. Its strange that points gained from this format are not considered in the Elo list. I think these points should be included, maybe with a difference in weightage. Chess has to deal with this. Elaborating on the game front, Anand said he is working on playing with black pieces. Drawing more with black and winning with white used to be my strategy earlier. Im trying to win more with black now. I have beaten Topalov, Shirov and Leko with black this year. I guess my ploy is coming off, said the player based in Collano Mediano, Spain. Anand, who is trying to develop his knowledge in astronomy as a second hobby apart from his interest in wildlife, refused to agree that the recent splurge in the number of GM norms and titles are not the right indicator of a players true strength. However, he did say there has been an inflation of sorts as far as Elo rating points are concerned. The Grandmaster title as such is still unaffected, but the rating table has been influenced. For example, somebody rated at 2600 now is not as strong a player as somebody with that rating nine years ago. But this also shows players are getting stronger. The base of the pyramid is getting wider. Maybe a further title (above GM) will help put things in perspective. Anand said he is yet to be approached by the All India Chess Federation about taking part in the Chess Olympiad scheduled for next year, but added he is willing to represent the country. We will form a good team, but the Russians will stay strong favourites. They are so strong!  Copyright

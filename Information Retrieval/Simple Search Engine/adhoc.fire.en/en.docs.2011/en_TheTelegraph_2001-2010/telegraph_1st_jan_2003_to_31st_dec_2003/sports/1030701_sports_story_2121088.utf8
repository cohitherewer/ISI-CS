The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India on right track: Greg 
Chennai: Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee feel the efforts put in by the MRF Pace Foundation have started to bear fruits. The two, along with Trevor Chappell and Sandy Gordon gave lectures on coaching to 40 former cricketers in a three-day seminar here. Indian coach John Wright was also present. Terming the conclave as a big success, both Chappell and Lillee said that it was a learning process for the coaches attached to the National Cricket Academy of the BCCI. Chappell said that Australias success is a product of a 20-year programme and the Indians are following. If the Indian coaches put the methods in right perspective, they would replace Australia as the world leaders. (PTI)  Copyright

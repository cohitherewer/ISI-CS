The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Were good enough to win, says Harbhajan
																								Jalandhar: Ace Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh feels the New Zealand debacle is history and the morale of the Indian team is high to clinch the World Cup in South Africa next month. 																								He felt the unfavourable conditions and the moist pitches led to the New Zealand nightmare. The Black Caps also played bad cricket, although they won at the end of the day, he said. 																								Harbhajan ruled out any technical changes to his bowling with the fast and bouncy tracks in South Africa in mind. Ill stick to my guns and hope itll bring bagful of wickets, he added.																								He felt that performing on the hard tracks of South Africa will be an added challenge as the ball will nicely come on to the bat.																								This team is a good blend of youth and experience and though we will have a tough group to contend with, Im sure we have the ability to come out with flying colours, a confident Harbhajan opined.																								The contract row also didnt seem to bother the offie. We are here to play cricket and the board is there to look after our interests, he said. 																								Harbhajan felt Pakistan, clubbed with India in the same group, is just another team and it is only the crowd which has a different vision when we play against Pakistan. He rated Australia as the toughest team, but added that India have beaten them in the past and there is no reason why it cant be repeated. The game against Zimbabwe in their own back-yard will also be a challenge, he felt. 																								Harbhajan informed he was concentrating on his batting as well. The tail-enders like Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar performing with the bat in the crucial matches augurs well for us in the World Cup, Bhajji signed off.  [+uc('(PTI) n More Cup stories on Page 26')+]

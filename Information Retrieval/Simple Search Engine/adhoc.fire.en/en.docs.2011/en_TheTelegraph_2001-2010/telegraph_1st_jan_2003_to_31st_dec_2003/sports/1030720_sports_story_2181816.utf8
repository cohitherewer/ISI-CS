The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barcelona pip United to bag Ronaldinho
 The Brazilian is expected to sign a five-year deal on Monday Barcelona, July 19 (AFP): Ronaldinho arrived here on Saturday from Brazil to finalise personal details after Barcelona announced they had beaten Manchester United in the race to sign the Brazilian World Cup winner. Ronaldinho is poised to move to the Nou Camp instead of Old Trafford after Barcelona announced that his current club Paris Saint Germain had accepted their bid of 30 million euros ($33.6 million). Uniteds final offer, which was lower than 30 million euros, was rejected by PSG, according to the clubs president Francis Graille. The French club informed Roberto Assis, brother and agent of Ronaldinho, and gave the go-ahead for the move to Barcelona. Ronaldinho, 23, is expected to undergo a medical Sunday before signing a five-year contract on Monday. Barcelonas website confirmed Ronaldinho was flying in to sort out the final details of his contract. Graille criticised the Premiership champions for not playing by the Fifa rule book and negotiating directly with the player. We havent been very impressed by our English contacts, Graille said. In fact, United have been too sure of themselves, believing that theyd done the hard work by negotiating directly with the player and going behind PSGs backs.  Copyright

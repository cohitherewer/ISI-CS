 Pak reach 227/4 on rain-curtailed Day III
 Yasir Hameed in full cry during his knock of 80 in Hamilton on Sunday. (AP) Hamilton: Play was severely restricted by bad light and rain in the first Test between New Zealand and Pakistan on Sunday. Pakistan, replying to the home teams huge first innings total of 563, took their overnight score from 118 for two to 227 for four as only 38.2 overs were bowled on the third day. No play was possible after tea but New Zealand coach John Bracewell said he was still hopeful of getting a result. Im not concerned about the overs weve lost because we can make up time these days, Bracewell said. But the wearing of the wicket is a problem because when we get out there tomorrow (Monday) well still be playing on a third-day wicket. When you get a big score, you want the wicket to deteriorate. We would have liked some sun on the pitch to help it deteriorate. Earlier, Yousuf Youhana and Yasir Hameed took their third-wicket stand to 79 before Youhana was caught by Lou Vincent in the gully off seamer Daryl Tuffey for 28. That brought skipper Inzamam-ul Haq to the crease and he helped Hameed add 75 for the fourth wicket. But Tuffey claimed his third victim of the innings when he trapped Hameed leg before for 80. Inzamam was 38 not out at the close and Abdul Razzaq unbeaten on 12. Bracewell said the uncertain weather had an affect on his bowlers. The guys would have been thinking how long are we going to be on the park?, and that means the bowlers try too hard and forget about the actual discipline needed, he said. Its a patience game. If you err off a length to these guys they hit you for four. Bracewell, though, was full of praise for Tuffey, who returned figures of three for 60 to take his wicket tally in Tests to 58. I just love the release of the ball from Daryl, Bracewell said. He gained a lot of confidence out of the (recent) Indian tour, he got the feel of being able to perform offshore and thats given him a huge boost.  Wiseman in squad Meanwhile, New Zealand have brought in a second spinner for the second Test starting in Wellington on Boxing Day. In the only change from the squad, Bracewell has added Canterbury off-spinner Paul Wiseman at the expense of batsman Richard Jones. Jones was named 12th man for the first Test after being included as cover for captain Stephen Fleming who was under an injury cloud before the game started. Bracewell said in a statement that playing a second spinner at Wellingtons Basin Reserve was a definite possibility.

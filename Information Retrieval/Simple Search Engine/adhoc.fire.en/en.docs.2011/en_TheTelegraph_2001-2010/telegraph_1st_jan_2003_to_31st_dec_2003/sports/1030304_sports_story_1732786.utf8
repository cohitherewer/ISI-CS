 Stacy Dragila regains pole vault record 
Boston: Stacy Dragila regained the womens world pole vault record when she cleared 4.78 metres on her second attempt at the US indoor meet on Sunday. The performance eclipsed Russian Svetlana Feofanovas world record of 4.77m on February 1 at Birmingham, and set the stage for another showdown between them at the world indoors in Birmingham, March 14-16. Dragila, the world outdoor record holder and Olympic champion, had watched Feofanova break the world indoor record seven times since she had leaped to what was then a world record 4.70m in 2001.

 Bangla vow to battle disaster
Johannesburg: Bangladesh team manager Abu Sharif Faruque warned Saturday that a failure to win any of their six World Cup games would be a disaster for the sport back home. Defeats to Canada and Sri Lanka in their first two matches here have extended their losing streak to 28 games and with encounters against South Africa, West Indies and New Zealand to come, Bangladesh are looking at more humiliation. Bangladeshs performance here have been hugely disappointing and if we fail in all our games it would be a cricketing disaster back home, Faruque said. Bangladesh went down unceremoniously to part-timers Canada in their first game by 60 runs and were then routed by Sri Lanka by ten wickets. Their only realistic hope of breaking their losing streak will be against Kenya on March 1 in their last group game in Johannesburg. I have received a very negative feedback after the loss to Canada because it was a match we were expected to win and this will affect the following back home. Bangladesh went into the World Cup having played a series in Namibia and a warm-up game which gave them a good lead-up, but things have gone from bad to worse since then. We never expected to lose against Canada after some good performances in Namibia and in a warm-up match we chased 251 to win, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

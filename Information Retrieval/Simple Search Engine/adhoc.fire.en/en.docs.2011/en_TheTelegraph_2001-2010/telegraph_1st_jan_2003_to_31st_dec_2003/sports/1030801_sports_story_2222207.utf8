 Prakash falls to Carlsen
Los Angeles: Wild card Prakash Amritrajs progress at the $380,000 Mercedes-Benz Cup was cut short by Kenneth Carlsen on Wednesday. The experienced Dane, ranked in the top-80, beat the Indian youngster 6-4, 6-2 to set up a third-round clash with Lleyton Hewitt. The top-seeded Aussie thrashed American qualifier Michael Joyce 6-3, 6-0. Prakash, the elder son of Vijay Amritraj, had ousted Marat Safin on Tuesday. The Russian, a former US Open champion, retired with an ankle injury when he was trailing 3-5 in the first set. Prakash also lost his doubles, he and cousin Stephen going down 6-7 (5-7), 4-6 to top seeds Rick Leach and Brian MacPhie of the US. Harsh Mankad bowed out of the $25,000 Denver Challenger singles event, local boy John Paul Fruttero beating him 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the second round. Mankad and British partner Arvind Parmar, however, advanced with a 6-2, 6-3 win over American Ryan Haith and Chilean Gonzalo Anguiano.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

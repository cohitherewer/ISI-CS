The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Subrata on notice at Tolly
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: After being sacked by Mohun Bagan last season, Subrata Bhattacharya is not having a good time at Tollygunge Agragami either. His team is struggling to make the Super Six cut in the Super Division League and to make matters worse, club officials and players are displeased with his way of going about things. We officials are not happy with his whimsical ways. His substitutions often defy logic and players are disappointed with his behaviour. He doesnt seem to show the respect some senior players deserve, said an official on Monday. Subrata was issued a sort of an ultimatum during Monday mornings training session when officials asked him what combination he intends to field in Wednesdays match and told him to train that lot accordingly. Tollygunge have a meagre 12 points from nine matches and have two tough teams in Mohammedan Sporting and Ever-Ready to contend with in their remaining two games. A Super Six berth is far from ensured. Though the official didnt say that Subrata will be sacked immediately, he hinted that the coachs future at the club looks uncertain. We are yet to look for a replacement, but wont be surprised if we find out that Subratas days with us is numbered. We have heard he himself wants to quit after guiding the team into the Super Six.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A security expert doing the rounds at venue
Efforts on to ensure people-friendly yet safe event FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  New Zealands Nathan Astle takes a break at Goodyear Park in Bloemfontein Wednesday as a security personnel keep watch. (Reuters) Paarl: Its not uncommon for those associated with the World Cups Security Directorate to suggest that even ants wont be allowed to sneak into any stadia. On the evidence of arrangements at BoE Park, during the India-Holland game Wednesday, thats no boast.Better be safe than sorry, explained a burly police officer as he directed vehicles (with the necessary sticker, mind you) to undergo two checks for explosives: The first was with the help of a sniffer dog (a German Shepherd)  and we were advised to roll up the glasses  while the second, unbelievably, was on a ramp. [So thorough is the access control that our driver, who didnt have a personal accreditation, was initially asked to leave the vehicle. Its after a series of requests that an exception was made. Still, a security assistant was assigned as a shadow till our preferred point of hopping off.]Its possible our expert (the German Shepherd) can miss detection and, so, theres this back-up, the officer told The Telegraph.While the expert required two rounds and less than a minute to give the all-clear, the ramp-inspection took longer.That, of course, wasnt all. While everybody had to pass through a metal detector, any piece of baggage  even a lap-top  was put through an X-Ray machine similar to those at airports.Quite an experience, then, for the uninitiated.Incidentally, the Directorates Mission Statement reads: ...to ensure that the tournament is a people-friendly, yet secure international sporting event. Well, nothing is being left to chance.The Directorate, by the way, is working in tandem with the South African police and intelligence agencies.  Copyright

 IHF to seek FIH, IOC advice on Jugraj
		 IHF is on the look out  for a physiotherapist for JugrajNew Delhi: The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) said on Monday that it will leave no stone unturned to get injured hockey star Jugraj Singh back on the field. The IHF is now on the lookout for a world-class physiotherapist who can help the player, recovering after a road accident last week, regain complete fitness. We will be asking medical boards of international hockey federation (FIH) as well as the International Olympic Council (IOC) to recommend names of the worlds best physiotherapists who can take charge of Jugraj, an IHF source said here. With the sports ministry already announcing to bear all his medical expenses, which also includes paying the physiotherapist, we will be giving him the best person in the business. He is making a fast progress and we hope he will recover completely within the next two to three weeks, said the source. We are collecting details about his treatment and by the time he is discharged we would have finalised the name of the physiotherapist who will guide him.  Camp postponed The IHF was forced on Monday to postpone the preparatory camp for the Asia Cup by a day after most of the probables failed to report on time. The camp, which was to begin at the National Stadium here on Monday morning, could not kick off as per schedule since only two probables  Viren Rasquinha and Prabodh Tirkey  managed to reach the city on Sunday, the deadline for the 21 probables to report for the camp. We do not know why the players failed to reach the venue on time. But we are expecting everyone to be here by tonight. Now we will be starting the training on Tuesday, IHF sources said.

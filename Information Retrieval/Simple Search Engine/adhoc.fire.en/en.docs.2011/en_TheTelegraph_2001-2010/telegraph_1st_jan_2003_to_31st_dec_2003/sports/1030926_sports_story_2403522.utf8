 Im ready for EB: Barreto 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto served a notice to East Bengal on Thursday, saying hes ready for them if they make it to the IFA Shield final. We expect them to be in the final on Sunday and my team will be ready for them, Barreto told reporters after helping Mohun Bagan demolish Tollygunge Agragami. The Brazilian, who was adjudged the Man of the Match, however, ruled out the possibility that he would seek a personal revenge against East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick if the match between the two teams materialises on Sunday. Bhowmick, it may be recalled, forced a one-match ban and Rs 30,000 penalty on Barreto by bringing to the IFAs notice the players involvement in a fracas during their Super Division clash. Barreto later strongly criticised Bhowmick for that. That was past and the only thing I have in my mind now is how to win this tournament, Barreto said. We showed fighting spirit against Tollygunge and need the same spirit, application and determination from everybody to win. Barreto felt playing against East Bengal is an extra motivation and his team is in a good position to beat them. Coach Aloke Mukherjee said his team gelled together well, much to his satisfaction. We have been fast improving. We are a good side if the fans and officials keep faith on us, I promise well not frustrate them for long, he maintained.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav faith helped Laxman
 - Nobody can stop improving, says Hyderabad middle-order batsman  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Laxman is focussed on the Test and will think of the ODIs after the Mohali game Chandigarh, Oct. 18: There are good reasons for Sourav Ganguly being credited with consistently backing youngsters in his three-and-a-half years as the Team India captain. What has been overlooked is that he has also been keeping faith in a number of senior pros who dont have superstar status  a case in point being V.V.S. Laxman. According to The Telegraphs sources, Sourav took the initiative in scripting the dasher-from-Hyderabads return to the ODI squad. The captains argument was simple: Laxman averaged 58-plus when world champions Australia last played in India (2000-2001) and, with the Ricky Ponting-led team featuring in the forthcoming tri-series, it made sense to bring him back. The national selectors went along and, so, Laxman figures in the XIV for the first three matches of the tri-series. Im happy to be back but, at the moment, Im focussed on the Mohali Test... We have a fight on our hands and Ill think of the ODIs once were through with this game, Laxman remarked this evening. Laxman, of course, hasnt played in any ODI after the New Years Day match (his 51st) in Christchurch and, expectedly, being overlooked for the World Cup hurts most. The selectors opted for the younger and fitter Dinesh Mongia. Only, the latter hardly made the most of the many opportunities and should only blame himself. Incidentally, Laxman was compensated by being given the India A captaincy for the West Indies tour. As luck would have it, back spasms kept bothering him and, consequently, he even had to miss the tri-series in Dhaka (which followed the World Cup). Surgery wasnt required, but I did complete an extensive rehab programme... Moreover, the fitness-specific camp in Bangalore (in August) proved beneficial... Today, Im batting well and, really, its a matter of capitalising on that, Laxman pointed out. Asked whether he was aware the selectors havent always been happy with his manner of rotating the strike and his fielding, Laxman said: Look, I believe absolutely nobody can stop improving... Thats been part of my philosophy... If theres something to learn from criticism, Ive tried to learn... Skills apart, Laxmans attitude has made him the player he is. As long that doesnt change, we should be watching more of him. Laxman turns 29 on November 1.  Copyright

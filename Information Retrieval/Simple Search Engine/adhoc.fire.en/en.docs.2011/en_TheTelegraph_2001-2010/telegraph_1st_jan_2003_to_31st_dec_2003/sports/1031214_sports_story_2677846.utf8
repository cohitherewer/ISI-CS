(Reuters) London, Dec. 13 (Reuters): High-flying Chelsea were brought crashing to earth by Bolton Wanderers on Saturday as the Premier Leagues big spenders surrendered top spot after a shock 1-2 home defeat at Stamford Bridge. The Londoners were overtaken by Manchester United who beat fierce rivals Manchester City 3-1 at Old Trafford. Chelsea slipped to their first home league defeat of the season when John Terry deflected substitute Henrik Pedersens last-minute cross past goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini. It had looked as though Chelsea were heading for a routine three points earlier when Hernan Crespo glanced them in front after 22 minutes but Bolton did not cave in. Chelsea had all the play but were pegged back six minutes before the break when Bolton defender Bruno NGotty rose unchallenged to head in Youri Djorkaeffs in-swinging free-kick. Chelsea introduced Joe Cole and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the second half but Claudio Ranieris side gradually ran out of steam against a well-organised Bolton side. Defending champions United now top the standings with 37 points, one ahead of Chelsea and two in front of third-placed Arsenal who can go top with a victory at home to Blackburn Rovers on Sunday. Paul Scholes was the key to Uniteds victory against City, scoring with two fine headers in a lively lunchtime derby. Starting a league game for the first time in two months after a groin injury, Scholes headed the champions in front from Gary Nevilles cross after seven minutes. City, who last won at Old Trafford in 1974, fell further behind in the 34th minute when Ruud van Nistelrooy headed home a pass from Ryan Giggs. Shaun Wright-Phillips pulled one back after 52 minutes but Scholes struck another header 20 minutes later to make the points safe.  Copyright

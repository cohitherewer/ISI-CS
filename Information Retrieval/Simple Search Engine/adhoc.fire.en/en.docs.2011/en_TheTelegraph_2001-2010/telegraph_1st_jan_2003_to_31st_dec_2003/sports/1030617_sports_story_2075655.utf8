The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Miandad turns defensive
- I havent read anything: Akram BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Nothing controversial? Akram with Miandad Calcutta: Some 24 hours after a UK tabloid published a damaging extract from his recently-released autobiography (Cutting Edge), the mercurial Javed Miandad has gone on the defensive.I havent accused any individual of having fixed matches. In fact, meri kitaab koi itni interesting bhi nahin hai, he told The Telegraph when contacted at the Midlands Crowne Plaza in Manchester, Monday evening.The tabloid, of course, quoted liberally from a chapter where Miandad, a former Pakistan captain and current coach, suggested that the ODI versus England in Sharjah on April 12, 1999, was fixed.Led by Wasim Akram, Pakistan lost by 62 runs after being dismissed for 144. Given the sides form, that surprised.Apparently, a series of calls alerted Miandad, then in his first stint as coach, that something was amiss. At the break, then, he made the players swear on the Quran  a tactic employed by Intikhab Alam in the early Nineties  and, not surprisingly, fireworks exploded.The extract reads: Some of the seniors were specially riled up I outlined a simple strategy and alerted everyone to play according to plan. The way our innings proceeded, though, it was as if I hadnt said a word to anyone. It was a pathetic performance With all the talk of betting syndicates in international cricket, and with match-fixing allegations swirling around major centres like Sharjah, I was also concerned that our performance may have had little to do with cricket. It wasnt easy for me to shake off this ideaMiandad, however, countered: Look, I havent read the newspaper Main kaise kahoon ki theek-theek chhapa ki nahin? In any case, my observations were general. After all, cricket mein kuch to ho raha tha. Or else, the Hansie Cronje scandal wouldnt have occurredWith the three-game NatWest Challenge getting underway Tuesday, Miandad had a team meeting to convene. The conversation, therefore, ended on that Cronje-note.Its unlikely, though, that the last has been heard about that match. And, pretty embarrassed must be the Pakistan Cricket Board supremo, Lt General Tauqir Zia, who released the autobiography!Significantly, Akram declined to say much. I havent read anything Main phir kya kahoon? was his exclusive response, when reached for a comment during Hampshires nets in Southampton.Present captain Rashid Latifs reaction, understandably, was exactly the same. The International Cricket Councils Anti-Corruption Unit, however, could have much to say.For the record, the Pakistan squad in England has just two survivors from that infamous game: Shoaib Akhtar and Azhar Mahmood.

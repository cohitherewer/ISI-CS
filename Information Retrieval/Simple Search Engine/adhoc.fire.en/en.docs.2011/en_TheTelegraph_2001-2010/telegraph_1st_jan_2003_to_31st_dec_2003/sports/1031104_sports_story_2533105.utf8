 CWealth delegates on recce in Capital 
New Delhi: A 50-member delegation of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) is in Delhi to get first hand knowledge of the citys ability to host the 2010 Games. The delegation, which arrived here Sunday, includes Michael Hooper of New Zealand, CGF chief executive officer and member, Bruce Robertson, Ian Emmerson and John Tierney  regional vice-presidents of America, Europe and Oceania, respectively, among others. A seven-member bid evaluation committee of the CGF made an official inspection of Delhis bid with reference to its infrastructure and commitment from various organisations involved in hosting the Games in August. The present visit is on a personal basis by the members who had come to India as guests at the inaugural Afro-Asian Games that concluded in Hyderabad Saturday. I have seen the city myself before, so I am here more as a guest. But others are trying to make the most of their visit to the Afro-Asian Games and have a first hand information on Delhis facilities, said Hooper.  (PTI)  Copyright

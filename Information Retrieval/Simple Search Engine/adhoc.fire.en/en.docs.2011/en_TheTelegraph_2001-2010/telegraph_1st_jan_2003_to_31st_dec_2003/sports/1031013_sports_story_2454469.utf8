		 Monday, October 13, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Filderstadt: Kim Clijsters held on to her world No. 1 ranking with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 win over fellow-Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne to retain her Filderstadt Grand Prix title on Sunday.				 																																	Clijsters took just over two hours to overpower Henin-Hardenne, who would have grabbed the No. 1 spot herself with victory. It was the eighth time the two Belgians have met this year. 				 																																	Each has four wins apiece but two of Henin-Hardennes victories came in the French and US Open finals. In a match of lengthy baseline rallies it was Clijsters who was the stronger player in the final set after the first two had been closely contested. 				 																																	Dharwad: Danai Udomchoke of Thailand justified his top billing in the Dharwad leg of the ATP Challenger series, winning the singles title here on Sunday. Udomchoke beat third seed Yeu-Tzuoo Wang of Taipei 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.				 																																	For Indias Prakash Amritraj, it was a disappointing day as he, teaming up with Rik de Voest of South Africa, lost in the doubles final to Ratiwatana brothers of Thailand  Sanchai and Sonchat. The Thai pair won 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. 				 																																	New Delhi: Former Asian champion Yasin Merchant got off to a superb start in the world snooker championships in Jiangmen, China thrashing Singapores Kevin Tang Chuin Wey 4-0 in a first-round match on Sunday. The Indian won 112-10, 89-3, 79-46 and 93-56. In another match, national champion Pankaj Advani defeated Mario Wehermann of the Netherlands 4-2 with the score reading 68-13, 80-9, 37-51, 71-31, 77-66 and 120-0, according to information received here.				 																																	Among the three Indian women in fray, Vidya Pillai beat Jessica Chapman of New Zealand 44-35, 10-45, 63-33, 71-75 and 48-35. 				 																																	New Delhi: Rupesh Roy added another feather to his cap when he won the boys singles title in the second leg of the ITF Pakistan international junior tennis championships in Islamabad on Sunday. 				 																																	The top seed Indian defeated third-seed Shahzad Khan of Pakistan 6-7 (4-7), 6-3, 6-3, despite faltering in the closely-fought first set. 				 																																	Sepang: Italian Valentino Rossi won his third consecutive world title, his fifth overall, in style on Sunday with victory in the Malaysian Grand Prix.				 																																	The 24-year-old Honda rider, who won the final 500cc championship in 2001 and the inaugural MotoGP championship last year, started from pole and, despite a slow start, his victory in 43 minutes 41.457 seconds was never really in doubt. Spains Sete Gibernau was second on Sunday ahead of Rossis compatriot Max Biaggi.				 																																	Abuja: Most swimmers who dream of competing on the international sporting stage might find it difficult to go on after losing a leg. 				 																																	But at the eighth all-Africa Games, one 19-year-old South African swimmer, whose lower left leg was amputated after an accident two years ago, proved that very wrong.				 																																	Natalie Du Toit not only won a gold medal in the 800m freestyle final last week, she did so competing against swimmers who werent disabled.

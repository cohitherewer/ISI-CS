The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Injury cloud over Jonty
Potchefstroom: South Africas joy at crushing Kenya by ten wickets here Wednesday was cut short when it was revealed that Jonty Rhodes had broken a bone in his right hand which could rule him out of the World Cup. He immediately left to see a specialist in Johannesburg where the full damage would be assessed. It was the second scare in the space of three days for the 32-year-old Rhodes who had to undergo an X-ray on Monday after aggravating an old injury to his right index finger while fielding against the West Indies in his teams opening match on Sunday. As a precaution, he took the field here today with his hand heavily strapped. Rhodes, who made his debut in 1991-92, was playing in his 245th one-dayer. Rhodes has already retired from Test cricket and playing his last World Cup.  (AFP)  Copyright

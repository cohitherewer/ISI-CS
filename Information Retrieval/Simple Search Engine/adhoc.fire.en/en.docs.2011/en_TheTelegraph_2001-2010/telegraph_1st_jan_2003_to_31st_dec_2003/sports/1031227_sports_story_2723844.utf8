The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Badani all focussed on final 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Hemang Badanis unbeaten 85 on Friday may have given the national selectors a timely reminder when they sit down to pick the Indian team on Sunday for the forthcoming tri-series in Australia. But Badani himself is more focussed on the ongoing tri-series than the bigger things that may await him. Its great to make the final. And winning it is primarily on our agenda before anything else, Badani said. The captain felt the biggest plus that has emerged for the Indians from this game is the bowling. The bowlers really stuck to their job, I hope its carried forward in the forthcoming games as well, he hoped. He added that there is still scope for improvement, especially in shot selection. Meanwhile, a dejected Sri Lanka A captain Russel Arnold defended his decision to bat first on a track that was giving some assistance to the bowlers. We batted badly, thats it, Arnold quipped. The skipper felt they also need to improve on their bowling to make the final. Tomorrow will be a tough game against Pakistan, he added.  Copyright

 Federer earns final date with Agassi
 Agassi after his win over Schuettler on Saturday Houston: Wimbledon champion Roger Federer overwhelmed world No. 1 Andy Roddick 7-6, 6-2 on Saturday to reach the final of ATP Masters Cup and a showdown with Andre Agassi. Earlier in the day, Agassi produced yet another magical comeback to beat Germanys Rainer Schuettler 5-7, 6-0, 6-4 and leave himself on the brink of capturing his first Masters title since his debut at the year-end finale 13 years ago. The 22-year-old Swiss needed just 62 minutes to crush hopes of an all-American final, humbling a helpless Roddick in front of his home fans. A perfect 4-0 heading into Sundays final, one more win will not only give Federer his seventh title of the season and the winners purse of $1.52 million but will push the Swiss up to No. 2 in the world rankings ahead of Spains Juan Carlos Ferrero. Im playing for something, Im not stuck at number three, I still have room to improve, Federer said.  Federer will carry a considerable age advantage on the 33 year-old Agassi. But Agassi has displayed unparalleled determination this week as he looks to end the season on a high note. Doubles title for Bryans Top-ranked American twins Bob and Mike Bryan outlasted Frenchmen Fabrice Santoro and Michael Llodra 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 on Saturday to capture the ATP Masters Doubles Cup. The Bryans needed a tense three hours and 15 minutes to complete a breakout campaign that also included their first Grand Slam win at the French Open. (Reuters)  Copyright

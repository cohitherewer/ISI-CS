The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain confirmed Test captain
London: Nasser Hussain will remain as captain of Englands Test team, selectors confirmed Thursday. Hussain, 35, stepped down as one-day captain after England were knocked out of the World Cup in South Africa. He said at the time he hoped his decision would prolong his Test career. England are scheduled to play two Test matches this summer against Zimbabwe and five against South Africa. The selectors are yet to announce Hussains successor as one-day captain. Yorkshires Michael Vaughan is the favourite for the job. Ive had my input and theyve had theirs, Hussain told BBC, referring to the selectors. Theyve got a very difficult decision to make because the two or three candidates whove been mentioned are very fine men. Ive played with all of them and its a difficult decision to try to separate them. Hussain predicted several youngsters would be handed debuts in Englands one-day squad following his retirement, as well as Alec Stewart and Andy Caddick. On Stewarts one-day retirement, Hussain said: Hell be missed definitely. Hes one of our best batsmen, if not one of the best batsmen of the last 10 years and one of our best keepers. But what me, Caddick and him have done is open the door for a lot of young lads out there to come into a very fine triangular series (against Zimbabwe and South Africa) and a one-day series against Pakistan. Theres five, six or seven of them who could easily make themselves into international names.  (AFP)  Copyright

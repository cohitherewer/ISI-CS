The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag does give thought to batting 
 - Sachin needs to sort out a few things: Greg Chappell  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sehwag is instinctive, yet isnt only instinctive Melbourne, Dec. 27: A leading newspaper here may have compared Virender Sehwag to a loose cannon, but Greg Chappell, an idol for generations, is convinced the opener is a much better thinker than is widely assumed. Ive been noticing small things and, in my opinion, Sehwag has a cricket brain and does give thought to batting. He definitely thinks more than is given credit. In fact, I would say he has an uncluttered mind and, when that is so, the feet are going to move well... Ive never interacted with Sehwag and, so, dont know the kind of person he is. But, yes, he keeps it simple, with nothing  be it the stance or whatever  extravagant. Of course, he is instinctive, yet isnt only instinctive, Greg told The Telegraph this afternoon. Reflecting on the openers career-best 195 yesterday, he said: Had a Sachin Tendulkar played that innings, it would have been put in the genius category... It was a great knock and Im not going to be critical of the way he got out (to a full toss from Simon Katich)... According to Greg, not going for that loose delivery would have been out of character for Sehwag and batsmen must play their normal game. He reminded: In any case, Im not the sort to stifle something which comes naturally. In Gregs view, the top feature of Sehwags knock was his willingness to build a platform before picking on the Stuart MacGills. Its felt that Sehwag just goes into overdrive. However, yesterday, we saw a different batsman  somebody who played for the moment and its requirements... All credit to him. Asked whether the opener needed to specifically work on handling the short-pitched stuff, Greg responded: Look, to get better, Sehwag can work on a couple of things... But, if youre concerned with his hopping, then even the best hop when bowled a good bouncer... Incidentally, prior to this series, the former Australian captains exposure to the opener was all on TV. Sehwag has certainly improved from the time I first saw him (in early 2001), he remarked. Meanwhile, Greg accepted that Sachin needed to sort out a few things. The two briefly met in the hotel lobby, this morning, but the Little Maestros idol declined to go into details. Please, its not for the papers... That wont be fair... All Ill say is that he needs to sort out a few things... Greg remained non-committal on whether, as was done with Sourav Ganguly, he would soon have a one-to-one with the out-of-form Sachin. The possibility of a session before the fourth and final Test (at the SCG) is very much there, though.  Copyright

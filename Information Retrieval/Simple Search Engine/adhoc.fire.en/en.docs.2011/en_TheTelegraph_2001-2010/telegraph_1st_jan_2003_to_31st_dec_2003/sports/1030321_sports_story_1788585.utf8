The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Call for Pak-India neutral venue
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Durban: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has sought New Delhis permission to play a Test series against Pakistan at a neutral venue. Such engagements now have the International Cricket Councils sanction.Confirming this Thursday afternoon, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya told The Telegraph: While weve moved the government, we havent yet got a response. At this moment, then, it wont be proper to say anything.Bilateral ties have been in the cold storage after Pakistans double-visit to India in early 1999. As for India touring Pakistan, the last trip was back in late 1997. Of course, while New Delhi has been opposed to one-to-one series, it hasnt come in the way of multi- lateral tournaments.In fact, three weeks ago, India played Pakistan in Centurion  and won convincingly.Pakistan, it may be recalled, has already featured in Tests at neutral venues: Sharjah and Colombo. First, the West Indies declined to tour Pakistan (in early 2002) and, then, Australia. Both had misgivings over security.Incidentally, the dates of the much-delayed Asia Cup should soon be finalised. Obviously, the tournament wont be hosted by Pakistan, which ought to have staged it last year  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rio may turn his back on England
 Ferguson feels Ferdinand has a strong case to move court London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has hinted Rio Ferdinand, who has 14 days from Monday in which to lodge an appeal on an eight-month ban for missing a drugs test, may turn his back on England. Ferguson also said the courts would be settling the matter unless the defender, who has also been fined 50,000, was judged fairly. Whether he ever plays for his country again, or whether he wants to play for them, is another matter, said Ferguson. But he has been condemned. We believe we have a strong case to take into the legal system. The United manager said: We will need to assess the situation. It may not end with the FA  we may have to go to court. He has got a right to go to court to protect his reputation. The club would certainly support him. Right from the word go he was bound to get charged because they (the FA) left him out of the English team. That condemned him right away. He has had to carry that burden from that minute when they banned him from playing for England. Ferdinand was left out of Englands squad in the last Euro 2004 qualifier against Turkey in Istanbul on October 11. The match ended 0-0 which was enough for England to go through to the finals in Portugal as group winners. We take it for granted his temperament is guaranteed and we take it for granted his laid-back character helps him, but like any human being he is not unbreakable, Ferguson said. You dont know what is underneath the surface. The fact that we have got so much out of him in the period when he has had to read all the headlines, read what Sepp Blatter (Fifa president) is going to do, what the FA is going to do, I dont think it has been easy for the lad. Fifa warning Blatter, however, has warned United and their manager Ferguson that any appeal to the civil courts is strictly forbidden. I hear of a threat to go to the civil courts - even to the European courts - but that is strictly prohibited in our rules, he said. And if you take that action, the repercussions will be unprecedented. You do not go to court. You present your case to our tribunal in Lausanne or you pay the consequences. These are the rules of Fifa and they will be adhered to. (Reuters)  Copyright

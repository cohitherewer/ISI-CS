 No one-day cricket for U-15 players: Vengsarkar
Bangalore: Former Indian captain Dilip Vengsarkar feels that the talented under-15 cricketers should be banned from playing one-day cricket to keep them away from bad habits. He added that it is important to get the basics right at an early age to have a long career in cricket. Vengsarkar, the chairman of the Talent Resource Development Wing of the BCCI opined that the kids pick up bad habits by trying to improvise and play cross-batted ugly shots in the limited overs game. Bowlers, on the other hand, try to bowl flat and on the stumps to keep runs in check. Vengsarkar was at the National Cricket Academy as a batting consultant to the under-15 trainees. Saying that Mumbai have already banned one-day cricket for under-15 boys, he said they should play two-day matches. Commenting on the 40 boys attending the camp, the chairman said: They are the supply line for Test cricket. He also felt that these boys lack exposure and the BCCI should take them to countries like Australia, South Africa and West Indies to get them used to different conditions.  (PTI)  Copyright

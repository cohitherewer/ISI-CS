 Relieved Lankans to go all out vs Zimbabwe
 Sanath Jayasuriya gets a massage in  East London Friday. (Reuters) East London: A relieved Sri Lanka coach Dav Whatmore celebrated his teams World Cup lifeline Friday after Indias seven-wicket win over New Zealand. Indias win handed Sri Lanka the chance to claim the last semi-final spot by beating Zimbabwe Saturday. If they fail, it will be New Zealand who will join Australia, India and Kenya in the last four. The games on, said Whatmore after spending a tension-packed day watching TV in his hotel room knowing that had Stephen Flemings Black Caps won at Centurion, Sri Lanka would be out of the World Cup. Youll find a very committed team. With the result having gone our way, the boys will be jumping out of their skins now. 			Captain Sanath Jayasuriya, suffering from a chipped bone in the thumb as well as tonsilitis, was confident his team could take advantage of New Zealands slip-up. Jayasuriya said Sri Lanka would be going flat out, while Whatmore indicated they would persevere with out-of-form batsman Mahela Jayawardene. Win it for Andy: Streak It may be curtains for Zimbabwe, but captain Heath Streak said his team will beat Sri Lanka and dedicate the victory to Andy Flower. Andys been a great servant of Zimbabwean cricket, said Streak. His record speaks for him. Hes up there with the legends of cricket.

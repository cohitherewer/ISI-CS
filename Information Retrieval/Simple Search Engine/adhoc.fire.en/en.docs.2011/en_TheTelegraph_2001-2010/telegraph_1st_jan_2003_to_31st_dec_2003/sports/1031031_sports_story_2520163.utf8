				 																																																	 Mohun Bagan are unlikely to take part in the forthcoming Durand Cup. Though the final decision has not been taken, the fact that Mohun Bagan have only one goalkeeper in their ranks, has made things difficult for the green-and-maroon brigade. While three of their top keepers, Prasanta Dora (official commitments), Imran Khan (injured) and Arindam Ghosh (down with jaundice) are unavailable, the only custodian at hand is rookie Bilifang. 				 																																																	Bilifang, incidentally, will make his debut for Mohun Bagan in the Super League play-off final against East Bengal. We cannot go into a tournament of the stature of Durand Cup with only one keeper, a top Mohun Bagan official informed. However, the decision will be finalised once coach Aloke Mukherjee returns after completing his commitments with the Indian team. Meanwhile, a final decision on Jose Ramirez Barreto, who is improving from his injury will be taken on Saturday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WI 161/2 after 36 overs
  Gilchrist scored a whirlwind 64 St Georges (Grenada): Australia opener Adam Gilchrist blazed 64 and Andy Bichel 41 to help Australia to 252 in the sixth one-day International against the West Indies on Friday.The West Indies had reached 161 for two after 36 overs. Wavell Hinds on 74 and Ramnaresh Sarwan (41) were at the crease.The home spinners, however, fought back after the touring side, opting to bat, had raced to 90 without loss in the 15th over.Chris Gayle took three for 37 before Australia were dismissed off the last ball as Nathan Hauritz was run out by a throw from the deep. It was the first time in the seven-match series that Australia had been bowled out.Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden had looked in total control against the pace of Mervyn Dillon and Corey Collymore but Hayden (29) finally lofted a leg-side flick off Collymore into the hands of Wavell Hinds just short of the square-leg boundary.The West Indies battery of off-spinners then put the brakes on at the Queens Park Stadium.Ricky Ponting gifted his wicket when, on two, he pushed the ball to Brian Lara at mid-on and was easily run out. Gilchrist then sliced the next ball from Marlon Samuels to Lara at backward point.The wickets continued to fall as Andrew Symonds (16) miscued a Ramnaresh Sarwan spinner to give Lara another catch at mid-on while Darren Lehmann was caught and bowled by Gayle after scoring 43. Brad Hogg, looking to guide a ball to third man, opened the face and was caught second ball at slip off Samuels without scoring. Gayle, with another caught and bowled, got rid of Jimmy Maher (19) as the batsmen continued to struggle with their timing. Brett Lee and Bichel, however, put together a 50-run stand for the eighth wicket, Bichel continuing his excellent series by hitting two fours and a six off successive balls from Sarwan.

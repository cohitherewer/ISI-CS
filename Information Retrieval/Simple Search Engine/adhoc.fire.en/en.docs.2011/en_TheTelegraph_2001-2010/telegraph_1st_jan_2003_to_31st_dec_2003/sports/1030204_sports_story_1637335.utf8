The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Batting to be blamed, says Sambaran
  BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: At the fag end of what has been a forgettable season, Bengal coach Sambaran Banerjee admits that his team has serious shortcomings in the batting department. After failing to collect even one points from the matches at the Eden but still remaining in the Ranji Trophy elite group, Sambaran said: We never gave the bowlers anything to fight with. Pitch, opposition were not the problem, its the fallout of batting failure. He feels the attitude of certain players is not right. Besides, their cricketing intelligence is not as good. Everything cant be screamed in from the fence, they have to take a few decisions. Its been our problem and we cant blame it on good bowling, bad pitch, poor umpiring or anything. Never did we give the bowlers a total in the region of 350-400, Sambaran said. Intruders freak out It was a good day for intruders at the Eden. Several of them  mainly there for the Frank Worrell Day blood donation camp  walked around the Club House end sightscreen, forcing the umpires to stop play on numerous occasions. Very disturbing, if it happens whole day, said a player. CAB officials made no efforts to stop scores of people as they made their way beyond the area marked players only.  Copyright

				 																																	Durban: South African selection committee chairman Omar Henry Wednesday singled out veteran fast bowler Allan Donald and allrounder Jacques Kallis for failing to perform up to expectations, leading to South Africas early exit from the World Cup.				 																																	Alan and Jacques did not perform to the high standards they produced prior to the start of the World Cup when South Africa played against Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Tests and one-dayers, Henry said.				 																																	Henry said one of the major problems with the selectors was inadequate bench strength. We did not have the necessary capacity to replace these players at crucial stages of the tournament, he said.				 																																	These factors will lead us to start a new era in our cricket and all our focus will be to start building for the 2007 tournament in the West Indies, Henry said.				 																																	Johannesburg: World Cup organisers are set to spend an uncomfortable two days worrying whether the remainder of their showpiece tournament will be played out in front of half-empty houses.				 																																	South Africas stunning exit in the rain of Durban on Monday has led to fears that the Super Sixes may go mostly unnoticed.				 																																	Everyone is disappointed that South Africa didnt progress to the Super Sixes, said Ali Bacher, executive director of the World Cup.				 																																	We have shown the rest of the world we have the capability to host a global event and we need the country to continue supporting in that way they have. I can understand South Africas supporters predicament, but we need the country to show how important the event is. 				 																																	n Sri Lanka vs South Africa, highlights from 8 am on MAX n Australia vs England highlights from 9.30 am on MAX n England vs India highlights from 				 																																	7 pm on MAX

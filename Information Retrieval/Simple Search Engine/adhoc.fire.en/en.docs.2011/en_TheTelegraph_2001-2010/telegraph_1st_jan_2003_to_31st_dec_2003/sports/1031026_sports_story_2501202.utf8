The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Qamar in last 4
Hyderabad, Oct. 25 (PTI): Commonwealth Games gold-medallist Mohammed Ali Qamar kept Indias boxing hopes alive by progressing to the semi-finals with a one-point win over Bilali Suleiman Wanjau of Kenya in the light-fly quarter finals of the Afro-Asian Games here tonight. Another Indian to bring joy was Ramanand, who emerged a runaway winner in the light weight quarter final. Ramanand crushed South African Bongani Mahlangu 26-8. Qamar, who survived the onslaught of hard-hitting Wanjau, a quarter-finalist in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, won 14-13 in the end. In semi-finals, Qamar faces Ethiopian Endelkachew Kebede, who received a bye to the last four stage, while Ramanand clashes with Korean Bak Jong-Su, an Asian Games gold- medallist. The Calcutta-based Qamar could not get his rythym in the first round and the Kenyan was classy with his mixture of both left and right. The Indian, though, was at his best in shielding and towards the fag end of the first round, the Kenyan sufferred a cut on his left cheek. Midway into the second round, Qamar started his charge and earned points. The Indian moved swiftly and used his left hand more often. He maintained his slight edge in the third round too. Qamar looked tired in the fourth round but still defended well.  Copyright

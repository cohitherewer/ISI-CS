The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Things are moving well, says Dalmiya
 - BCCI chief meets ICC president Mani for 35 minutes  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Dalmiya Mani Mumbai: As the sun began to set on Friday,  Ehsan Mani and Jagmohan Dalmiya, heads of the International  Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket  in India (BCCI), respectively, took to the cane chairs religiously  laid out at the CCI every evening.  Both talked non-stop for around 35 minutes and broke  off only because Dalmiya had to ready himself to host the  ICC delegates at a pre-arranged dinner at the Taj. Obviously,  they spoke about the contentious Player Terms and the decision  by IDI Ltd (the ICCs business arm) to withhold Indias  World Cup-related guarantee money. Their dialogue should continue on Saturday.  Ehsan and I have a good equation...  Things are moving well, is all that Dalmiya told The  Telegraph. Of course, he is understood to have again reminded Mani that the BCCI has formally called for releasing that $ 6.5 million with interest. The ICCs position is nothing will move forward till the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), its commercial partner, reverts on the claims made. Apparently, a huge chunk of the over Rs 200 crore sought as damages is bogus and, therefore, has placed the BCCI on a strong wicket. Significantly, the GCC hasnt reacted even though the ICC forwarded its own observations (on the claims) two months ago. But even if the GCC responds in the next couple of weeks, only the Executive Board (ICC/IDI Ltd) is empowered to sanction the guarantee money release. The next Board meeting, by the way, is in Barbados (end-October). The directors of both Boards (ICC and IDI Ltd) are common.  Incidentally, while nobody realistically expects the  Player Terms issue to remain unresolved till the 2004 Champions  Trophy  the next ICC mega event  host Englands chief  executive Tim Lamb chose to have a lengthy chat with Dalmiya  before the latters interaction with Mani.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Batsmen face bigger test in India
 - There is no substitute for real time spent in the middle  under hot and humid conditions
 Top View / John Buchanan If Indian players feel that performing  well Down Under  be it in Australia or New Zealand  is  their ultimate challenge, rest assured, players from these  two countries feel much the same way about playing in India.  When Australia last toured India, the term last frontier  was doing the rounds, with Steve Waughs men feeling that  a Test series win here would be the icing on the cake. That,  quite famously, was not to be. New Zealand, who will set foot  on Indian soil on Sunday evening, must be feeling that this  is the series to prove their worth. Reports emanating from  New Zealand a month ago suggested that the Black Caps were  quite serious about improving their track record in India. They were simulating Indian pitches  and conditions so that players could begin the acclimatisation  process while at home itself. Time will tell us whether  these novel methods will bear fruit. The Indian challenge  for Australians and New Zealanders is more pronounced for  the batsmen. In this regard, I think real time spent in  the middle in hot and humid conditions, on dry wickets,  is the ultimate instructor. When we came to India in 2001,  the one batsman who just could not stop scoring runs was  Matthew Hayden. Till that tour, the big Queenslander  was considered something of an under-achiever. Few thought  about the fact that he had played in Indian conditions,  having toured with an academy team early in his career.  Three Tests later, his little-known  trip to India had been well-documented, and once again there  was proof that there is no substitute for real time in the  middle. The other batsman who found some  consistent touch with the bat was Steve Waugh, and he had  played in India a number of times from the late 80s. Quite  simply, experience is the best teacher in his case. For spinners, the tour to India  is something of a double-edged sword. While you have pitches  that any spinner would trade his right arm for, there are  also batsmen who make the best in the business look like  ordinary journeymen. The conditions are there to be exploited  but sadly for the slow bowlers, Indians are so good in using  their feet that the spinners wiles often add upto nothing. Bowlers of the calibre of Shane  Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan have little to show for their  efforts in India, and that is great testimony to the abilities  of the Indian batsmen. With the batsmen taking time to  come to grips with conditions and the spin bowlers being  rendered somewhat ineffective by every Indian batsmans  natural affinity to spin bowling, the workload falls on  the pacemen. These are not dream conditions  for any fast bowler. The weather provides the greater challenge,  with humidity proving the biggest enemy, followed closely  by dry, soft wickets.  On the last tour to India, Glenn  McGrath would lose around six pounds of body weight by the  end of the day, after his bowling. He tried to acclimatise  to Indian conditions by not turning on the air-conditioner  in his room. He would have to down gallons  of water and amber fluids to keep himself going. For any  fast bowler this is the ultimate test  playing pace has  always been the Achilles heel for batsmen, but keeping oneself  going for five days is very, very challenging even for the  fittest. The Black Caps must have all these  factors playing on their minds as they take that long journey  to India. They are without Shane Bond, and that must be  a blow to them.  Captain Stephen Fleming has played  a few good knocks in the subcontinent and he will look to  lead from the front in the two Tests. Daniel Vettori, on  the other hand, will know that he will have a big challenge  on his hands. The Black Caps are methodical,  systematic and hard-working  a perfect complement to the  unpredictable genius that makes the Indian team so exciting.  By the time we join these two  for the tri-series, these rivals would have got a good measure  of each other as well as the conditions. It will be up to  us to catch up. GAMEPLAN Copyright

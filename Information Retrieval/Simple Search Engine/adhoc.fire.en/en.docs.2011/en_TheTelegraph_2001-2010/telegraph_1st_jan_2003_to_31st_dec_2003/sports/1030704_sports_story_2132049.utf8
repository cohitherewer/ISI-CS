The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nothing real about Real
- Cameroon confirm participation for Afro-Asian Games BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Real Madrids proposed tour of India has been called off.The Indian Institute of Welfare and Business Management, who had initiated efforts to bring the Spanish giants to the city in the middle of August, informed that a South East Asian country has clinched the deal with Real instead. We gather that a South East Asian country has clinched the deal with Real worth $5 million, Ashok Dutta, the director of the IISWBM, told The Telegraph. Dutta went on to add that the date became a bit of an auction and it was not possible for us to compete.He, however, said they are in constant touch with other foreign clubs like Barcelona FC and Bayern Munich, and hope to have one of them on a later date. Earlier, the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi seemed to be in complete dark about the proposed tour.Talking to reporters at a function to mark the launching of Mohammedan Sportings official website, he said: Who are organising this? We have just seen media reports so far. The AIFF president said the senior national teams next international commitment will be at the Afro-Asian Games, expected to take place in October. Only Cameroon have confirmed participation in football so far. But dont expect a full-fledged team, he said.About the Indian teams preparation, Das Munshi said a camp is expected to be held once the Federation Cup gets over in mid-August and talks are on to have friendly practice matches with teams from China, Iran, Thailand and Japan/Korea.We will finalise this during the AFC meeting in Kuala Lumpur to be held later this month. And hopefully, at least one of these teams will play. Preliminary matches of the football event at the Afro-Asian Games may be held in the city with Hyderabad hosting the semi-finals and final.

 Pak aim to repeat Multan show
 Habibul Bashar at nets in Faisalabad on Thursday. (AFP) Faisalabad: Pakistan will look to extend its lead over Bangladesh in their one-day series on Friday when they meet at Faisalabads Iqbal Stadium for the second one-dayer of the five-match series. Pakistan claimed a crushing 137-run win over the visitors in the opening match at Multan on Tuesday. We want to capitalize on our first win and perform in a similar fashion, captain Inzamam-ul-Haq said on Thursday. All Pakistans top ranked batsmen were among the runs in Multans encounter. Yasir Hameed  in his new role as opener  scored his maiden one-day century, while Inzamam and Younis Khan blazed quickfire half centuries to mount an impressive total of 323 for three. I promoted Yasir as an opener because you have to give your best batsman maximum number of overs to bat in a one-day International, Inzamam said. Yasir is a good batsman against fast bowlers and with field restrictions in the first 15 overs, he can get maximum advantage, Inzamam added. Pakistan is unlikely to change a winning combination for the second match which means 19-year-old medium fast bowler Junaid Zia, son of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Tauqir Zia, should get another chance. Junaid made an unimpressive debut in Multan, where he went wicketless in seven overs and conceded 35 runs. Despite losing the Test series 3-0, Inzamam said Bangladesh were a much-improved side. They have been playing international cricket for the last three years and they have definitely improved, he said. The Pakistan captain admitted that his team took their opponents lightly in the Test series, which allowed Bangladesh to come close to its maiden Test victory when it lost the match by just one wicket last week. We sat together after the Test series and decided not to take them (Bangladesh) lightly in the one-day series, and you saw improvement in our performance in the last one-dayer, Inzamam said. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore said his team needs to bowl tighter in order to restrict Pakistans strong batting line-up. THE SQUADS Pakistan: Inzamam-ul-Haq (captain), Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Nazir, Yasir Hameed, Yousuf Youhana, Junaid Zia, Kamran Akmal (wicketkeeper), Shabbir Ahmad, Umer Gul, Shoaib Malik, Abdul Razzaq, Younis Khan, Danish Kaneria and Salman Butt. Bangladesh: Khaled Mahmud (captain), Hannan Sarkar, Habibul Bashar, Sanwar Hossain, Mohammad Ashraful, Rajin Saleh, Alok Kapali, Mohammad Rafique, Khaled Mashud, Tapash Baisya, Alamgir Kabir, Mashrafe Bin Murtaza, Mushfiqur Rehman, Hasibul Hossain and Tushar Imran.

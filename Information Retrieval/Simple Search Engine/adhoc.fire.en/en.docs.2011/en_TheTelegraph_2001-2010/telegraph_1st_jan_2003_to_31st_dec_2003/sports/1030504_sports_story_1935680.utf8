The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Change of guard at IFA 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, May 3: After a long hiatus, the Indian Football Association (IFA) is sure to see a change at the helm Sunday when the secretarial issue will be solved. The indication, till late, shows that the current treasurer Subrata Dutta, nephew of former secretary Prodyut Dutta, will be the only secretary instead of a joint secretary scenario. Joint secretary Ranjit Gupta, recovering from a cardiac illness, finally declined to fight his case. I could have considered my case had there been an option for joint secretaries. Since this is not going to be the case, Ive informed the IFA that I wont be contesting. Besides, Im unwell and I want a break for at least four months, Gupta told The Telegraph Saturday. Keshto Pal, the other joint secretary, is also unlikely to contest. Dutta said: It will be a one-secretary scene, and there isnt anybody else on the horizon so far. Even before his illness, Gupta had indicated that he wasnt interested in another term. He has served two, the first with Mantoo Ghosh.  Copyright

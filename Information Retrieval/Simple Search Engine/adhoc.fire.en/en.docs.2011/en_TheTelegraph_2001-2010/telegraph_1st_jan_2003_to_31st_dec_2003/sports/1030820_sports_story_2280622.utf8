The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, August 20, 2003  Callisto may strike it rich 
 BY STAR RACER		 Vijay Singh  Calcutta: Trainer Vijay  Singh may be trusted to go all out with his three runners   Assailer, Alsheim and Callisto  in their respective events.  Callisto, in particular, is sitting pretty at the weights  for the days feature event, the 1,100m Robin Hood Cup. 				 										Although running after a long lay-off, the Brave Hunter-Aunti Katie daughter has been shaping well in her morning trials to suggest that she is all geared up to strike it rich against the Daniel David-Errol Bhungard brigade in a field of six.				 										Daniels Activity is, however, fancied to win the Mr Mauritius Cup, a 1,200m sprint, from Assailer, who may need this outing. Also a Brave Hunter daughter, the three-year-old Activity was seen galloping easy to ultimately place a decent fifth in a big field of 14 in her last start.				 										In his previous start, Alsheim was seen galloping leisurely in the rear. The six-year-old by Tecorno out of Karishmas Pet was, however, seen covering a good deal of ground, up in the stretch, to finish only four lengths behind the winner, Regal Rocket. 				 										The only thing against Alsheim seems to be his heavy weight of 61 kg. If he fails, it is the Mumbai migrant Moira, appearing to be relishing the city monsoon course, who may again make a pillar-to-post attempt to win the Gold Kale Handicap.

 Durham sign Gibbs
London: English County Durham announced on Tuesday that they have signed South African opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs as one of their overseas players for the 2004 season, as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition. Gibbs, who averages over 45 in his 47 Tests and nearly 36 in one-day Internationals, is currently enjoying a great series against England, which continues with the third Test at Trent Bridge on Thursday. We are delighted with the signing of such an experienced player and I am confident he will make a major impact on the field as well helping some of the younger players develop, Durham chief executive David Harker told the Countys website. Bob Jackson, Durham chairman, added: Durham are committed to attracting the very best of overseas talent and Gibbs continues this trend.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

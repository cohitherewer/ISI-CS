The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Double by Sania 
Hyderabad: Sania Mirza of India has made it a grand double at the ITF womens circuit meet in Benin City, Nigeria. Sania scored an emphatic 6-1, 7-5 victory over Anca Anastasiu of South Africa to add to the doubles title she won earlier in the day, partnering Rebecca Dandeniya of Britain, according to information received here Sunday. Sania was ruthless in her demolition of the South African who had no answer to the Indians ground strokes. Anca did put up a fight in the second set but Sanias forehands found the lines at critical junctures. In the doubles final, the Indo-British pair outclassed Franziska Etzel of Germany and Christina Obermoser of Austria 6-3, 6-0. (PTI)  Copyright

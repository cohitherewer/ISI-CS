The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne found not guilty
 Melbourne: A businessman was fined $ 8,500  on Friday for attempting to blackmail Cricket Australia  (CA) with an allegation that Shane Warne had kissed his  15-year-old niece.  Christopher Kent, 46, pleaded guilty in the county  court here to a charge of attempting to obtain property  by deception. The court said Kent rang up the CA in early 2002, telling them the media was offering his niece $ 3,675 for her story about an encounter with Warne. Kent told the board to match the offer or his niece would go public with the allegations. According to a report, Judge John Nixon said Kent had lied about the media offering the girl money. He said Kents actions could have damaged the reputation of the CA and Warne.  Warne was alleged to have kissed the teenager and  asked her to partially expose herself in January last year,  an allegation he emphatically denied. He was later cleared  of any wrongdoing. He has refused to comment on the case.  (AP)  Copyright

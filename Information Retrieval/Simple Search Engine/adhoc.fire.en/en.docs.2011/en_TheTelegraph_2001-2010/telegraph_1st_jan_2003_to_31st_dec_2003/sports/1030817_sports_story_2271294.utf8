 Anwar calls it quits
 Anwar hoped to play for two more years Karachi, Aug. 16 (Reuters): Sidelined Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar announced his retirement from cricket on Friday. I am happy that I am leaving the game when many people feel I can still play on for another two years. But I have been disheartened by the selectors decision to ignore me after the World Cup, Anwar said. The 34-year-old left-hander ended a 15-year career with 4,052 runs at a world-class average of 45.52 in 55 Tests and 8,823 runs, averaging 39.21, in 247 ODIs. He made 11 centuries in Tests and 20 in ODIs. He also holds the world record for the highest individual score in an ODI  194 against India in Chennai in 1997. Anwars decision came two months after Wasim Akram announced his retirement from international cricket. He and Wasim were among eight senior players dropped after Pakistan failed to qualify for the second stage of this years World Cup. Despite struggling increasingly with knee problems Anwar was the only Pakistan batsman to score a hundred in the tournament, making 103 in the defeat against India. He had said he hoped to play for two more years.  Copyright

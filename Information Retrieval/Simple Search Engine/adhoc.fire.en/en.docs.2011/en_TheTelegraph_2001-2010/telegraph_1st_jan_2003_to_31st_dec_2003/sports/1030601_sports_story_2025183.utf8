 Jadeja: Ill fight for ODI slot
New Delhi, May 31 (PTI): Ajay Jadeja, recently cleared by the high court to play domestic cricket, said today he would fight to get back to the Indian team. He said he was fit and eyeing a slot in the national ODI team once again. I see myself as a one-day cricketer and 37 is the limit for a fit player, the 32-year-old said. There could be no better motivation than try and get back to play for India, he said. Jadeja, who turned out for Air Sahara in the Lala Hari Ram Memorial meet today, said: Playing international cricket is my first priority.  Copyright

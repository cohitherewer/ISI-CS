 Ballesteros for a tech-check 
Tenerife: Five-time major champion Seve Ballesteros believes a quarter of all tournament professionals would be eliminated from competition if the rapid advances in club and ball technology were no longer available. The 46-year-old, who is playing in his 30th successive Spanish Open, is also critical of the games two ruling bodies for not keeping up with the pace set by golfing manufacturers. There would be no more than 54-degree sand wedges, I would ban belly and long putters, there would be only 12 clubs allowed in the bag, and not 14, and I would make the ball bigger, Ballesteros said. That would eliminate 25 per cent of players. The game was invented by the British to develop skill and intelligence in players but the way technology is going, anybody can play. For pros, it should be different, he said, adding his changes would not affect amateurs. (Reuters)  Copyright

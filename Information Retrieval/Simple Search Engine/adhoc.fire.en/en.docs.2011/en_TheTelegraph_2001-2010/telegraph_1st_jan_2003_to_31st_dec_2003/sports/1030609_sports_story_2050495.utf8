The Telegraph - Calcutta
 6th national crown for Naren Kumar
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: V.R. Naren Kumar and co-driver Moosa Sherif of Team MRF gave yet another awesome display of speed and precision driving to win the MRF Taj Challenge Rally, the second round of the Motorsports Association of Indias 2003 Indian National Rally Championship (INRC), in Nashik on Sunday. With this win, Naren Kumar, without regular co-driver D.

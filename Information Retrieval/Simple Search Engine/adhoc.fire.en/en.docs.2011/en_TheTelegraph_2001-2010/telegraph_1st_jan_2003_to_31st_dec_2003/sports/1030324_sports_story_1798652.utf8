The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Monday, March 24, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Ahmedabad: Indias young wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel may still get a chance to appear for his Class XII board examination if he returns from South Africa by Wednesday, a day after the exams get underway.				 																																	If Parthiv can make it before March 26 and is prepared to appear for the other papers, he will be allowed a day off and reappear for the missed paper in July. 				 																																	If he cant, he will have to write all the papers next year, said Gujarat School Education Board chairman P.V. Trivedi.				 																																	Trivedi said there was no provision in board laws to conduct special exams for one student, but the board was sympathetic to Parthiv because he had missed the same examination last year because of his cricket schedule.				 																																	Fearing he may miss the exam this year too, Parthivs parents had approached education department officials to consider him as a special case. The wicketkeeper, among reserves throughout the World Cup, turned 18 earlier this month.				 																																	Calcutta: Regulars at temples on Sundays were greeted with a sight they dont usually come across. It was a mass consisting mostly of youngsters and their agenda was common. An Indian win of course it was, but unlike the previous days during their recent trips, the final prayer fell on deaf ears. God must be Aussie.				 																																	Those possessing posters of cricketers and even the ones with pages torn out of magazines did brisk business in the morning before running out of stock. Those dealing in colours just a few days back had preserved a part of their aabir and even that went missing before the last packet of Mother Dairy did. 				 																																	Siliguri: Bitten by the cricket bug, the principal of a local school announced waiving admission fee for two days beginning Monday if India won the coveted Cup.				 																																	I feel if our boys do win the Cup it will be a real cause for celebration, said B.K. Karna, principal of Livingstone Foundation School at nearby Salugara.				 																																	To make the occasion special we want to share the moment of pride with the children and their parents by waiving the admission fee from nursery to class XI. 				 																																	Johannesburg: Hundreds of campaigners staged demonstrations outside the Wanderers, venue of the final between India and Australia, to protest the US-led war against Iraq Sunday. The resentment of the protestors, carrying placards which read War is not the Answer and Down with US Greed, was directed at Australia which is supporting US in the war.				 																																	We hope Australia loses the World Cup because (Australian Prime Minister) John Howard supports the war in Iraq, the anti-war coalition spokesman said. He said around 800-1000 people had participated in the demonstrations. However, a police spokesman put the figure at 250. We have many policemen deployed to monitor the situation and everything is proceeding peacefully, a senior police official said.				 																																	n Follow Through from 7 am on ESPN n India-Australia World Cup final repeat telecast from 9.30 am on DD 2 and 4 pm on MAX

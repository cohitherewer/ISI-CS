The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ not in awe of Aussies
 Chris Cairns at nets in Port Elizabeth Sunday Port Elizabeth: Coach John Buchanan expects Australia to prove Tuesday they learn from their mistakes and can perform in any condition. The unbeaten world champions pace attack will not be helped by a slow St Georges Park wicket against New Zealand, but Buchanan said they would have to adjust for the Super Six encounter. It is important for our key bowlers, whether they be Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath or Andy Bichel, to adapt, he said Monday. I think we have the capacity to bowl well in any condition...and the same applies to the batsmen. When Australia played England at the same venue in the first phase of the tournament their fast bowlers, apart from Bichel, struggled while the top-order batsmen threw their wickets away. Australia edged home by two wickets thanks to Bichels seven for 20 and 34 not out and an unbeaten 74 from Michael Bevan. Buchanan said he did not expect a repeat of those errors. The batsmen have thought about their game and the type of wicket they are going to play on. Buchanan said the pitch seemed to have a bit more moisture than at the same stage before the England match but added: We cant do anything about it, its a slower wicket, a bit up and down and I think most teams would prefer to play us here. Thats fine, we have to deal with that and if we play reasonably well in this match we are back here for a semi-final so we also have to learn from our experiences. 			Australia have delayed naming their side but are expected to retain the same eleven that thrashed Sri Lanka by 96 runs Friday to give them seven wins out of seven. All-rounder Andrew Symonds will miss his second game in succession as he continues his recovery from a groin injury, with Ian Harvey set to continue in his place. The eve of the match saw Australia adopt their now-traditional optional net session and just three players  spinners Brad Hogg and Nathan Hauritz and left-arm pace bowler Nathan Bracken  took up the option. Meanwhile, New Zealand are also on a winning streak, having won five-in-a-row, since their opening game loss against Sri Lanka on February 10. The Black Caps have insisted they will not be intimidated by Australias awesome pace battalion after Brett Lee was used as a battering ram to deliberately target Sri Lanka skipper Sanath Jayasuriya Friday.

 Mary Pierce bows out
 Mary Pierce during a break in her match against Flavia Pennetta in the WTA Indian Open in Hyderabad on Thursday Hyderabad: Young Flavia Pennetta of Italy made giant strides in her fledgling career to demolish fourth seed Mary Pierce of France 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 and storm into the semi-finals of the $140,000 WTA tournament here on Thursday. Giant-killer Akiko Morigami of Japan also continued her brilliant run, beating Silvija Talaja of Croatia 6-4, 6-2 to book a berth in the last four stage. Pierce later said her concentration was disturbed by sore throat. I had throat infection and it was bothering a bit, she commented. Later, Pierce and Sania Mirza bowed out to Elena Likhovtseva (Russia) and Iroda Tulyaganova (Uzbekistan) 6-3, 1-6, 4-6 in the doubles quarter finals. The winners will now meet Katalin Marosi of Hungary and Jelena Kostanic of Croatia who trounced Penetta and Andreea Vanc 6-4, 6-1. Third seeded duo of Evgenia Koulikovskaya (Russia) and Tatiana Poutchek (Belarus) beat Yulia Beygelzimer (Ukraine) and Ananstassia Rodionova (Russia) 6-3, 6-3, while Li Ting and Tian Tian Sun of China triumphed over Australian Trudi Musgrave and Thai Tanasugarn in straight sets 6-1, 6-3. From a ball girl to a vanquisher of the favourite, Pennetta has come a long way. A decade ago Pierce was playing in Italy and she would have hardly noticed the ball girl who was running with precision to pick up the ball and hand it over to the players. The same ball girl faced Pierce again but in a changed role. This is the biggest win for me, Flavia said after the match. I still remember Mary playing in my country when I was a ball girl and 10-year old.  (PTI)  Copyright

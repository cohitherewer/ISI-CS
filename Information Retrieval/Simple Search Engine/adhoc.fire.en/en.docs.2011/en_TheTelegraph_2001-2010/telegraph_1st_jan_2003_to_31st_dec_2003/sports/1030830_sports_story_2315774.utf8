 Ali Qamar, Ramanand in final
 Ali Qamar New Delhi: Mohammed Ali Qamar and Ramanand kept alive Indias hopes of bagging a gold medal as they reached the finals of the Commonwealth boxing championship at Kuala Lumpur on Friday. While Arjuna awardee Qamar reached the final in the light flyweight category, Ramanand made it to the gold medal match in lightweight, according to information received here. However, two other Indians, Akhil Kumar (flyweight) and Diwakar Prasad (bantamweight) had to be content with bronze medals as they lost their respective semi-final bouts. Heavyweight V. Johnson and Jitender Kumar (light heavyweight) also assured themselves of at least a bronze medal as they reached the semi-finals in their respective categories. Harpal Singh (super heavyweight) is the only Indian to have crashed out of the tournament so far. Other teams taking part in the competition include England, Australia, Japan, Korea, Uganda and Kenya.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Raising the bar comes easy for Hayden
	 - Hard work pays rich dividends for intense pro  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Bradman and Taylor, second  highest among Aussies. Calcutta: Scrambled eggs, muesli, sausages, orange juice Matthew Hayden is pretty particular about breakfast. Actually, he doesnt have a huge appetite for runs only. It was over one such meal, on the eve of this years World Cup final, that Hayden spoke at considerable length to The Telegraph. He didnt duck and, characteristically, was frank. At times, brutally so. As the 35-minute interaction was drawing to a close, one asked whether he was conscious of records and averages. Grinning, Hayden replied: Doesnt drive me, though I have an idea of where Im placed. What Im conscious about is treating every ball as an event Over two days (Thursday-Friday) at the famed WACA Ground, in Perth, Hayden himself became the event. And, by the end of his amazing 437-delivery stay, had relegated Brian Lara to No.2 in the highest individual (Test) scorers club. Frankly, in this Australian side, captain Steve Waugh and Hayden alone had the best credentials to get past the genius from Trinidad. The latter did so with intensity that was often frightening. Incidentally, had Steve not called upon the selectors to pack his 2000-2001 team to India with strong characters, its possible the men-who-matter would have overlooked Hayden. And, then As has been well documented, Hayden made the most of that trip: A phenomenal 549 runs in the three Tests and handsome scores in the ODIs. Even today, he regards that tour as the turning point in a career which began a decade ago. Besides cementing a Test berth, it brought Hayden (who turns 32 on October 29) back to the ODI XI. He continues to be a certainty. Unlike most who attempt to be ignorant about their own limitations and, thereby, reach a dead-end all too soon, Hayden identified his at an early stage and improved every season. Not many years ago, for example, he couldnt quite sweep. To overcome that, Hayden literally begged Cricket Australia (then the ACB) to send him over to Chennai for a week at Bishan Singh Bedi and Srinivas Venkatraghavans clinic. Thanks to that entirely self-driven effort, in the late Nineties, he can now sweep any opposition out of the game. In fact, while speaking that morning, Hayden acknowledged he never quite fancied himself as the most gifted around. Specifically, Hayden said: I didnt have as much talent as some of the others Didnt see myself as naturally gifted and, so had to work hard Inevitably, that encouraged much analysing  however, when that seemed to go out of hand, he put a stop to whatever was unnecessary. Much in keeping with the approach of the two cricketers who have had the biggest influence  Steve and Allan Border  Hayden never stepped back from constantly raising the bar. Often, he challenged himself. Its not surprising, then, that Hayden wasnt overawed at the prospect of crossing the sacred 334 before setting sights on 376 and beyond. Absolutely no disrespect to Mark Taylor, but sentiment shouldnt really have too high a priority in a pros game plan. Of course, its not that Hayden is sans emotion. Overseas, for instance, he specially misses infant daughter Grace and wife Kelly. Moreover, he cant do without the beaches for long. Taylor, for his part, was the first to present Hayden with a bottle of champagne. Just as Lara was among the quickest of callers (on manager Steven Bernards cell) to congratulate him. Once the bubbly was uncorked, Australias newest cricket-icon fulfilled Media commitments and parked himself before the dressing room TV, rooting for the other Australian side in action (at the rugby World Cup, in Sydney) during the day. [The hosts, by the way, won big at Argentinas expense.] As of now, Haydens teammates will be making a formal presentation once the Test gets over. The champagne, though, wont stop flowing.

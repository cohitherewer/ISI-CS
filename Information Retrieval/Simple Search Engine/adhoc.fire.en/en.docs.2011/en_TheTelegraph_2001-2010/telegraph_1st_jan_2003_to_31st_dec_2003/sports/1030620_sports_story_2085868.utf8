The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vaughan wary of Shoaib
 Shoaib Akhtar London: England one-day captain Michael Vaughan admits facing Pakistan quickie Shoaib Akhtar will be a challenge for his inexperienced side in Fridays second ODI at The Oval. The Rawalpindi Express missed Pakistans two-wicket win in the opening match of the three-game series at Old Trafford Tuesday as he was completing a two-match ban for ball tampering. But Shoaib is now available for Fridays match and could form a potent new-ball attack with young paceman Mohammed Sami. We faced Shoaib in Cape Town (where England beat Pakistan by 112 runs in a World Cup match in February) and he was getting it around the 100 mph mark, Vaughan said Thursday. Vaughan admitted his team faced a tough challenge in squaring the series. They have got a few exciting batsmen and in Shoaib Malik, an off-spinner who can turn it the other way.  Stephen Harmison, who was not in the XI Tuesday, could play on Friday. ICC warns England Meanwhile, England have been warned by the ICC to go back to the drawing board over ground security after a pitch invasion at the end of the first one-dayer. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said at Lords Thursday that he was dismayed by the events at Old Trafford. Ultimately its the ECBs responsibility. We cant have international matches where players and officials are subjected to pitch invasions. There are calls for legislation and I would support that, he said.  (AFP)  Copyright

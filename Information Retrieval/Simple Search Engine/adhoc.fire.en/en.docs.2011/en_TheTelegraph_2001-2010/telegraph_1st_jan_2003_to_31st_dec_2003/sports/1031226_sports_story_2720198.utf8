The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India humble Pakistan, earn bonus point
 - ASIAN A MEET - Latif (128) defiance buried under home teams 329  BY ATREYO MUKHOPADHYAY  Yuvraj Singh after reaching his half-century at the Eden on Thursday. Yuvraj hit 60 off 43 balls. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Having gone into Thursdays Kenstar Asian A Championship tie against Pakistan urgently needing a win and with the urge to prove a point at the Eden, India made the occasion memorable with a thumping 80-run victory and a bonus point too. It was a slaughter of the innocent (The Pak attack comprises mostly greenhorns) by the seasoned Indian batting line-up  highlighted by two contrasting partnerships  which virtually ended the match in the first half as the hosts amassed 329 for six. Amit Bhandari then broke Pakistans back with a four-wicket burst that reduced the visitors to 44 for five by the ninth over. Naveed Latif saved Pakistan A from serious embarrassment and also took them close to the 264-mark which would have denied India A the extra point. A victory without bonus fetches five points where the losing team gets one, while the losers get none and the winners six if they clinch the bonus. The right-hander came in at 26 for four in the fourth over and was last out for 128 (124 balls, 7x6, 11x4). Latif was clearing the fence with increasing ease towards the end, but lost his cool after the fall of the ninth wicket. His presence was a constant threat to Indias quest for the sixth point and his slow medium stuff was instrumental in keeping the Indian batsmen in check for a while in the first half. The match was actually over with the Indian innings, after Pakistans new-ball bowlers Rauf Khan and Junaid Zia had failed to find the right length. Gautam Gambhir and the experienced Sanjay Bangar pounced on every opportunity to send the ball to the boundary with the former being the dominant partner in the initial stage. Gambhir followed up his 113 in the first match with 82 (75 balls, 1x6, 12x4). The Delhiite, who likes to get onto the frontfoot and drive, deflected the leg-side stuff off his pads with the finesse associated with most left-handers. He was tested in the first few overs by off-spinner Mohammed Hafeez, but won the battle once he decided to use his feet instead of trying to force the ball through the 6-3 off-side field. Bangar was the more sedate of the two. He played principally in front of the wicket and tried to make most of the short ones with width on either side. A big innings looked on the cards before he tried to drive one that moved away from just short of driving length. He was the second to fall at 194 in the 33rd over for 81 (107 balls, 13x4). Before that, Bangar and Gambhir had put on 154 off as many balls. Hemang Badani perished while going for an early kill and this brought together Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh at 196 for three in the 35th over. Their 121-run stand off 85 balls sealed Pakistans feat. Working the ball into the gaps in the beginning and running for everything, the duo first ensured that there were no more casualties. Yuvraj launched a powerful assault after this. He was brutality personified on the on-side as the last ten overs produced 110 runs. The left-hander, who smashed Zia back over the sightscreen, stopped at 60 (43 balls, 1x6, 7x4). Kaif lasted till the final over for a well-paced 75 (75 balls, 1x6, 5x4). Pakistan just didnt have the fire to match this. Sri Lanka head the table after the first round with ten points. India have six and Pakistan one with the teams scheduled to play each other once more. It will take a monumental effort from Pakistan to extend their stay in the city till December 30  the day of the final.  Copyright

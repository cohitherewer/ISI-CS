The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gold for Rakhee Saha
Nagercoil: The National Circuit athletic meet turned out to be a disappointment Thursday with the stars putting in below-par performances and failing to set new marks. The meet was missing top athletes like Sunita Rani and K.M. Beenamol while Neelam J. Singh managed a best of just 57.6m in womens discus. Rakhee Saha of Bengal clocked 11.80 seconds to win the womens 100m. Poonam Tomar (Delhi) and Greeshma (Kerala) came second and third, respectively. (PTI)  Copyright

 Scud fells Agassi, Roddick in last  8 
 - Serena, Clijsters lead march of  top womens seeds into quarter finals Twice champion Venus  Williams stormed into her sixth consecutive Wimbledon  quarter finals by demolishing Russias Vera Zvonareva  6-1, 6-3 Monday. (Reuters)  London: Australian Mark  Scud Philippoussis put an end to Andre Agassis dream  of winning his second Wimbledon title when he ousted the  world No. 1 in the fourth round Monday. Philippoussis won  6-3, 2-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4 to set up a last-eight clash with  Alexander Popp of Germany. Popp, a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon  three years ago, made the most of his 35cm height advantage  over Belgiums Olivier Rochus to win 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. However, fifth seed Andy Roddick  and a quartet of leading womens contenders from the US  stormed through to the quarters. Roddick convincingly saw off 12th-seed  Paradorn Srichaphan 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 after fellow Americans  Serena and Venus Williams, Lindsay Davenport and Jennifer  Capriati had dodged the rain to reach the last eight. Roddick, seeking his first Grand  Slam title, faces unseeded Swede Jonas Bjorkman in the last  eight, who beat Belarussian Max Mirnyi 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6. The 20-year-old Roddick is still  on course for a much-anticipated semi-final meeting with  Swiss fourth seed Roger Federer, who beat Feliciano Lopez  7-6, 6-4, 6-4. Meanwhile, former champion Davenport  swept through to a quarter final berth against Venus with  a 6-4, 6-1 defeat of Japans Shinobu Asagoe. Davenportbroke serve in the opening  game of the match and wrapped up the first set in 29 minutes  under a brooding grey sky. Venus, on the other hand, made  her sixth consecutive quarter final demolishing Russias  Vera Zvonareva 6-1, 6-3. The 59-minute victory allowed  Venus to avenge her fourth-round defeat to the 18-year-old  at Roland Garros. Belgian second seed Kim Clijsters  put personal friendship to one side and bludgeoned doubles  partner Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-3, 6-2 en route to the quarters. Clijsters quickly settled into  her rhythm after an hours rain delay and her crunching  forehand proved too much for Sugiyama, the 13th seed. Serena crushed 15th seed Elena  Dementieva 6-2, 6-2 to reach the last eight for the fourth  year in a row. The top seed and defending champion rattled  off the first four games in nine devastating minutes to  leave her opponent, looking shellshocked. Former world No.  1 Jennifer Capriati also powered her way into a quarter  final showdown against Serena with an effortless 6-2, 6-3  win over Russian Anastasia Myskina. Paes-Rikl in quarters Leander Paes and David Rikl were  through to the doubles quarter finals on Monday. The fifth seeded pair overcame  rain delays and a first set deficit to defeat Giovanni and  Nicolas Lapentti 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 in the third round.  (REUTERS) Copyright

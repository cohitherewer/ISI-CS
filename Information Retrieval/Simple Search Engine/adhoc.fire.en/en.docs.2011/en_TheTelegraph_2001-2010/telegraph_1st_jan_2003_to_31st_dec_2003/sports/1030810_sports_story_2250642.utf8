 AIFF mulls triangular meet
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Aug. 9: If things go according to plans, football fans will get a taste of the international variety very soon. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said on Saturday a triangular tournament has been planned, as early as late September, involving South Korea, India and a team from the Middle-East. Das Munshi, here for the Tata Federation Cup final, said: We want this tournament to prepare for the Afro-Asian Games in October. He added the Afro-Asian Games may be postponed if the Lok Sabha elections take place in November. In that case, we will have the tournament sometime in late December or early January. The tournament will be named Nehru Series and the matches will be held across the country. The national body and the IFA are on collision course, on the issue of the payment of the fine for the 2001 IFA Shield final fiasco. Das Munshi said IFA is yet to pay $5000 as fine for delaying the explanatory report on the final between East Bengal and Palmeiras FC of Brazil. The AIFF boss said they will pay the fine but realise the amount from the IFA later. But IFA secretary Subrata Dutta countered, saying the report had been sent well before time. Only time will tell, who has to bow, Dutta said.  Copyright

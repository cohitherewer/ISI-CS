Otieno, eldest of the three Obuya brothers who represented Kenya at the World Cup in South Africa, will be returning to the English club for which he played in 2000.				 																																	We have agreed on the terms and I will be playing for BAT for one season which starts in April and ends in September, Otieno, 31, said.				 																																	Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) fixtures secretary Sharad Ghai confirmed the reports and said Otieno had the KCAs blessing to play for the English club.				 																																	New Delhi: Fang Han of China won the gold in the womens trap event on the penultimate day of the Asian clay shooting championships on Wednesday.

In their first campaign in the top flight since 1968, they finished 13th and they currently occupy the same position with seven games remaining. Seven years ago Fulham finished 17th in the third division. 				 																																	Barcelona: Barcelona will launch another appeal against their two-match ground ban following a ruling from the Spanish sports councils disciplinary committee that the original sanction should stand.				 																																	The Spanish football federation imposed the two-match ban after fans hurled plastic bottles and other objects  including a stuffed pigs head  onto the pitch during Barcelonas league game at home to Real Madrid earlier this season.				 																																	Barcelona were informed by the sports council on Tuesday that their bid to get the stadium closure overturned had been unsuccessful. If the appeal fails they will have to play two league games away from the Nou Camp as punishment.

Stadium court producer Bob Ruf was originally leery about playing the song but felt one minute of the music probably wouldnt offend the audience. The tournament received no complaints.				 																																	Capriati told a WTA spokesman that she picked the music because, quot;I like it and I want to support the troops. quot;				 																																	n Football, English Premier League: Liverpool vs Leeds United from 12 noon on STAR Sports n General: Sportsline, live from 7.30 pm on STAR Sports n Tennis, ATP Masters Series: Nasdaq-100 Open, live from 12.30 am (Friday) on STAR Sports

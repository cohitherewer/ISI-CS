The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Canada run Kenya close

Chasing a modest 198 to achieve only their second win in 12 World Cup matches, the Kenyans reached their target with nine balls to spare as Canada, buoyed by their shock win over Bangladesh, pushed them all the way. It was far too close for comfort, said Kenya captain Steve Tikolo. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Schumis rivals predict a battle
 Juan Pablo Montoya Budapest: Kimi Raikkonen and Juan Pablo Montoya predicted an exciting end to the Formula One season here Sunday after putting Michael Schumacher under further pressure. McLarens Raikkonen finished second in the Hungarian Grand Prix to move to within two points of Schumacher, while third place for Williams Montoya reduced his deficit to one point. Schumacher was left disappointed after coming home eighth to leave his rivals predicting an intense battle in the final three races of the season. We are only one point away and we can finish ahead of him in the next race, then we are going to be leading the championship, but we have to wait to see where Kimi ends up and everything, Montoya said. I think its going to be a quite exciting end to the season, added the Colombian. Raikkonen added: Im quite happy with second place from seventh (on the grid) and its better now in the championship of course. Anything can happen in the race and hopefully we can improve the car and be quick in the next race also. Montoya, however, was critical of Schumachers driving tactics after claiming the world champion drove towards him as they battled for position at the second corner on the opening lap.

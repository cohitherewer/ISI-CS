 Dhaka slog pleases Mongia
Chennai: Dinesh Mongia is happy with the way he fared with the bat in the Dhaka tri-series after a none-too-good World Cup in South Africa. The left-hander is particularly pleased with the pace at which the runs came in the meet also featuring South Africa and Bangladesh. My performance in Dhaka was okay, especially my strike rate, said Mongia, who aggregated 103 runs at 51.5 with a strike rate of 99.03 in Dhaka, where India and South Africa shared the honours after rain marred the final. Mongia was criticised for slow batting in the World Cup and the 66-ball 32 he made against England didnt make things any better. I batted slowly in that innings because I was asked to stay at the wicket. I batted under instructions, said Mongia, who managed only 120 runs with 42 as highest in South Africa. The Punjab batsman pointed out that he did not get the chance to bat in all matches. I did not get to bat at all in five games and then a couple of games were against Australia in full flight. Mongia redeemed himself in Dhaka with a 38-ball 55 against South Africa and the hurricane fifth wicket stand with Mohammed Kaif. There was pressure to get some quick runs and I could carry on the assault, said Mongia, who went past the 1000 run mark during the tri-series. Mongia intends to play for Chemplast Club here this summer despite getting offers to play league cricket in England. I didnt get an offer to play for any county. There were offers for league cricket but I feel it wouldnt serve my game.  (PTI)  Copyright

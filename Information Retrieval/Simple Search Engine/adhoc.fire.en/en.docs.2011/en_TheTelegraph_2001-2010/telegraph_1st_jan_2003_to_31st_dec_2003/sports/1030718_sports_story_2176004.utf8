(AFP) Foxboro: Marvin Gonzalezs goal 14 minutes from time gave El Salvador a 1-0 victory over Martinique in the Concacaf Gold Cup on Wednesday, securing a quarter final tie against Costa Rica. Earlier, Costa Rica clinched their place in the last eight with a 3-0 victory over Cuba. El Salvador and Martinique both went into their Group C match needing a win to progress. Jose Gordon almost gave Martinique a 36th-minute lead but his shot was well saved by goalkeeper Juan Gomez. At the other end, Heurlie made several stops before Gonzalez finally struck. Heurlie saved substitute William Alegrias point-blank shot but the ball fell kindly for Gonzalez to tap in from 10m. Costa Rica, who also needed a win to stay in the competition, powered through thanks to their 3-0 victory over Cuba in Group D. A brilliant strike from Walter Centeno in first-half stoppage time gave Costa Rica the lead before substitutes Steven Bryce and Erick Scott put the game beyond Cuba, who now meet the US, the defending champions, in the last eight. Costa Rica eventually broke through when Carlos Castros corner was volleyed in by Centeno from 18m. Bryce doubled the lead almost immediately by slamming in a shot from 14m. Five minutes later, Costa Rica made it 3-0 when Scott pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Waited a long time for this: Fleming
Johannesburg: The career-best knock of 134 not out which helped New Zealand beat South Africa in a group B World Cup match took long time in coming, said skipper Stephen Fleming. Ive waited a long time for an innings like this and Im very happy to lead the side this way, Fleming said. New Zealands original target of 307 was reduced to 226 in 39 overs after two rain interruptions but they scored runs at a frenetic 6.27 an over to seal a nine-wicket win. Anything over 300 is pretty difficult but we had to be positive. We thought it was our last chance, a knockout chance and we will see what we can do. I am very happy to lead the side this way and stay in the tournament, Fleming said. The situation is out of our control. We need the results to fall in our favour, Shaun Pollock said. Its very difficult now (to qualify) but we still have hope, said Pollock. We still believe we can get through. You fancy yourself to defend 306 but they came out and played well. The conditions did not help us much but they outplayed us and all credit to them, Pollock said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

		 Thursday, January 30, 2003 				 Becker in Hall of Fame
																								Newport (USA): Six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker of Germany and former International Tennis Federation president Brian Tobin of Australia were among four people named on Wednesday as inductees to the Tennis Hall of Fame for 2003.																								Former world number one Becker, Tobin and 1960s womens stars Francoise Durr of France and Nancy Richey of the United States will be enshrined here on July 12.																								Becker won Wimbledon in 1985, 1986 and 1989, the US Open in 1989 and the Australian Open in 1991 and 1996. He held the world number one ranking for 109 weeks, winning 49 ATP singles and 15 doubles crowns.																								I am very delighted and feel it a great honour to be inducted into the Hall of Fame, Becker said. It has always been my dream to be a part of this honourable institution and I will treat my membership with great respect.																								Becker, 35, stunned the tennis world with his breakthrough Wimbledon victory in 1985, becoming at the time the youngest man to win a major at 17. He became a crowd favourite at the All-England Club, where he reached the finals seven times in 10 years.																								Tobin has spent 45 years in tennis, including ITF president from 1991-1999 and Tennis Australias president from 1977-1989, during which he oversaw construction of the current Australian Open retractable roof stadium facility.																								Durr was ranked as high as third in the world, that coming in 1967. Her only Slam singles title came at the 1967 French Open but she also captured 11 Slam doubles titles in a career that brought 26 singles and more than 40 doubles crowns.																								Until Mary Pierces 2000 triumph at Roland Garros ended a 33-year drought, Durr had been the most recent French woman to capture her nations title.																								Richey was ranked as high as second in the world, that coming in 1969. She captured 69 career singles titles, including the 1967 Australian and 1968 French crowns. She also won four Slam doubles titles.																								Richey lost in the finals of the US, French and Australian finals in 1966  the same year she captured three of four Slam doubles titles, failing only at the French. (AFP)

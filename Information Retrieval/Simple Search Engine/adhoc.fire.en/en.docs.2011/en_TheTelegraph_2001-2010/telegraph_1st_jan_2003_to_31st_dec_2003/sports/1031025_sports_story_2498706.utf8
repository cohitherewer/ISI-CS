 Bangla make England toil
		 Hannan Sarkar in action  on Friday. (AP)Dhaka: Bangladesh reached 245 for six in their second innings, a lead of 153, on the fourth day of the first Test on Friday as England struggled against a team who have lost 23 of their 24 Tests. When bad light ended play early, Mushfiqur Rahman was unbeaten on 43 and Khaled Mahmud on 17. Matthew Hoggard was the only England bowler to pick up a wicket in the final session when Javed Omar (27) was adjudged leg-before by umpire Asoka de Silva, despite the hint of an inside edge. England took three wickets in the afternoon session, including 20-year-old Hannan Sarkar who edged a good length ball from Hoggard to Marcus Trescothick at first slip for 59. Alok Kapali was out for 12 when he skied a pull to Mark Butcher at mid-wicket, giving Steve Harmison his seventh wicket of the match. Spinner Ashley Giles grabbed his first wicket of the game when Nasser Hussain made a sprawling catch at silly mid off to dismiss Khaled Mashud for seven. Earlier, a century partnership between Habibul Bashar and Sarkar put Bangladesh ahead. Bashar fell for 58 just before lunch when he edged a flighted ball from spinner Gareth Batty to Trescothick at first slip. England debutant Rikki Clarke bowled a useful spell in the afternoon with a mix of good length balls, yorkers and slower deliveries. But Batty and Giles failed to extract the same turn produced by Bangladesh spinners Mohammed Rafique and 16 year-old Enamul Haque Jr. on Thursday.  (Reuters)  Copyright

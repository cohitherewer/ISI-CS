 Hameed hits 170 on debut 
 - First Test vs Bangla l Pakistan in the box seat after Day II  Yasir Hameed cuts one en rout to his 170 against Bangladesh in Karachi on Thursday. (Reuters) Karachi: Yasir Hameed hit a scintillating debut century to help Pakistan gain the upper hand on the second day of the first Test against Bangladesh on Thursday. Hameed made a magnificent 170 as Pakistan finished the day on 301 for five in reply to Bangladesh first innings total of 288. At close skipper Rashid Latif was unbeaten on 27 and Misbahul Haq was not out on 12 as Pakistan led by 13 runs. Hameed became the ninth Pakistani and the 76th batsman in history to hit a century in his first Test. The 25-year-old, from Pakistans northwestern border city Peshawar, led the recovery after his team lost opener Mohammed Hafeez for two and then recalled Inzamam-ul Haq, who was out without scoring. Hameed, who hit a double century in a domestic tournament final in February, swept Bangladeshi spinner Alok Kapali for his 18th boundary to hit three figures in 183 minutes off just 143 balls. He finally played a tired-looking pull straight to mid-on off Mashrafe Murtaza for 170 in 311 minutes, off 253 balls and spiced with 25 hits to the rope. Hameed added 97 for the second wicket with opener Taufeeq Umer and later steadied the innings with a 131-run stand for the fourth wicket with Yousuf Youhana. Umer, who also scored a debut century against Bangladesh two years ago, completed his 1,000th run in 14 Tests before driving straight into the hands of Javed Omar at point, off left arm spinner Mohammed Rafique. Youhana played second fiddle to Hameed during his knock of 46 before handing a return catch to part-time spinner Razin Saleh. Pakistans most experienced batsman Inzamam-ul Haq, recalled for this Test after being sidelined for four months, lasted just five balls before scooping an easy catch off pacer Tapash Baisya for nought. Hameed later dedicated his century to his late father, who dreamed that his son would become a world class cricketer. I dedicate this hundred to my late father who had predicted that I will score a century in my first match for Pakistan, said Hameed. My father was a lawyer but he always wanted me to play cricket and make a name for myself in international cricket Had he been alive he would have felt so proud of me, Hameed added.

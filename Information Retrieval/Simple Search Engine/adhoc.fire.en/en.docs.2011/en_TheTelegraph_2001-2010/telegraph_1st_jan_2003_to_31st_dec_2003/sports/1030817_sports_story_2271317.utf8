The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Woods way behind
Rochester, Aug. 16 (Reuters): Shaun Micheel surged two shots clear of the field after Phil Mickelson, co-leader overnight, twice found water to surrender a three-shot cushion in the second round of the US PGA Championship on Friday. With only five players in the 151-strong field breaking par in difficult conditions at sun-baked Oak Hill, Micheel birdied four of his last five holes for a 68, finishing at three-under 137. Left-hander Mickelson slumped to a 75 for 141 and Tiger Woods ground out a 72 for 146. Mike Weir, who threw away a two-stroke lead with bogeys on his last two holes, carded a 71 to tie for second at one under with Billy Andrade (72). Australias Rod Pampling, joint-leader overnight with Mickelson with 66, was alone in fourth at 140 after returning a 74 as the wind swirled and the greens hardened at the East Course. Seventy players made the halfway cut at eight-over 148.  Copyright

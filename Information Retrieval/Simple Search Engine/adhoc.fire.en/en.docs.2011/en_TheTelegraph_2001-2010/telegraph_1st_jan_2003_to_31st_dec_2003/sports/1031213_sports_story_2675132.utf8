The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aur accha karna tha, says Pathan
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Irfan Pathan (right) celebrates with Parthiv Patel after dismissing Matthew Hayden on Friday Adelaide: I thought he would swing the ball more... But, surely, hes going to improve. That was centurion Ricky Pontings assessment of debutant Irfan Pathan. Actually, the 19-year-old himself agrees he ought to have bowled better. Aur accha karna tha... Aur accha karne se jyada khushi hoti... Am I disappointed that two catches were dropped? Nahin... Yeh sab to khel mein hota rahta hai, Pathan, Man of the Series during the recent U-19 Asia Cup, told The Telegraph. Asked about the tips received from idol Wasim Akram, he said: Jyada mental toughness ki baat huye... Then, I asked him about his famous yorker... He also spoke about swing... Another one-on-one with Akram is on the cards.  Copyright

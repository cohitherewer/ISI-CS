The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Alex nets five
Rio de Janeiro: Cruzeiro midfielder Alex scored five goals, including four first-half penalties, as the Brazilian champions whipped Bahia 7-0 away on Sunday to condemn their opponents to second division football next year. The championships final weekend was marred by a pitch invasion in Porto Alegre, where former champions Gremio beat Corinthians 3-0 to complete a miraculous escape, and a brawl in the Sao Paulo-Flamengo match, which ended with six players sent off.

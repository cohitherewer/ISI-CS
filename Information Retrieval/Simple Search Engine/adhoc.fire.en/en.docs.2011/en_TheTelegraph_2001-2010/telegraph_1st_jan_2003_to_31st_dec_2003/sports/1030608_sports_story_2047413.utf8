Strengthwise, they are really in a bad shape, Jackson said Saturday. He feels that at least three to four months of hard training is imperative for them to reach the required strength. Ill be there for only a month, but the boys need follow the fitness regime and work very hard to keep them in shape, Jackson added. He, however, felt that the teams running ability is much better.

 US may shun national colours off-track 
Raleigh: As a precaution, United States Track and Field athletes at the 2004 Athens Olympics might be discouraged from wearing red, white and blue or anything with USA when they are not competing. For security reasons, if thats the way they want to go, thats what well do, said United States mens athletics coach George Williams, also coach at St Augustines College in Raleigh. USA Track and Field spokeswoman Jill Geer said on Monday that off-track uniform issues are governed by the US Olympic Committee. Coaching and managerial teams always look at a number of security issues before any international competition, including clothing, Geer said. For the 2004 Games, the Olympic team is within the oversight of the US Olympic Committee. A spokesman for the USOC did not return a call seeking comment on whether that organisation was considering such a proposal. Greece is spending more than $ 750 million for security  the biggest security budget in Olympic history and more than three-and-a-half times as much as what was spent for the 2000 Sydney Games. Authorities plan to deploy about 50,000 security personnel  including 16,000 soldiers  during the Games. Williams said track officials have suggested ways to lower the profile of American athletes around Athens. (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rhythm is key for smiling assassin
 - Brett Lee feels he is at his best;  Ricky Ponting has his plans ready for Sachin FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Lee: Im not malicious  Durban: Back in Sydney,  Brett Lee can easily pass off as the boy most mothers would  want their daughter to date. With a million-watt smile,  he does light up many miles. On the cricket turf, though,  batsmen wish Lee simply didnt exist. Its another matter that Lee is  bass guitarist with the popular Six and Out band. For, on  the field, his renditions arent exactly music to the batsmans  ears. Indeed, assuming its an India  versus Australia final, next Sunday, Lee will be the most  prickly thorn in Sourav Gangulys path. He rattled Team  India in Centurion last month and, since, has grown more  menacing. Sanath Jayasuriya got the Lee  treatment not many days ago and, yesterday, it was Kennedy  Obuyas turn to head for the hospital nearest Kingsmead.  Obuya, of course, was the first of Lees hattrick victims. However, like most explosive quicks,  Lee has a softer (deceptive, at that) side  and it surfaced  during the post Australia-Kenya match Media conference.  Im not the malicious type... Thats just not me... Fact  is, when youre bowling at 140-150 kph, theres bound to  be some damage if the batsman doesnt connect... Thanking captain Ricky Ponting  for guiding him towards the fourth hattrick in eight editions  of the World Cup, Lee added, smiling: After having missed  out on occasions, its great to have got one... Its thrilling.  Chetan Sharma (1987), Saqlain Mushtaq (1999) and Chaminda  Vaas (2003) are the other hattrick-achievers. Given that Lee had five wickets  in a 15-ball spell against New Zealand, its pretty evident  hes at his best. I suppose, yes... Dont think Ive bowled  better at any stage of my career... The hattrick will remain  special, not only because its a hattrick, but I got the  wickets when the ball was new. In the New Zealand game,  it was different. Asked if he was disappointed at  not getting the Man of the Match award, which went to veteran  Aasif Karim, Lee responded: It would have been nice...  Having said that, Karim also bowled well and, so, deserved  it. Later, talking to The Telegraph,  Lee insisted he wasnt conscious about speed. When Im  at the top of my run-up, my eyes arent on the speed gun...  Rhythm is what I look for...Anything else is a bonus. That should please Lees guru,  Dennis Lillee. Ponting, meanwhile, is looking  to both Tuesdays semi-final versus Sri Lanka (in Port Elizabeth)  and the March 23 final. Weve first got to get Lanka out  of the way and, then, India must beat Kenya... We do have  a nice record against Lanka and Im confident of our side  doing well. Speaking of India, theyve lifted  their game from the time we last played them (February 15)...  Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra, specially, are setting them  up pretty well and Sachin Tendulkar is firing. We know he  can win any match single-handedly... But, if it comes to  another face-off, well have plans in place. Incidentally, while accepting  his team did have some reservations about the Port Elizabeth  wicket, Ponting said the groundsman had assured the semi-final  would be on a wicket prepared from a different block. Actually, going by Australias  run throughout World Cup 2003, Ponting doesnt have to worry  too much. Copyright

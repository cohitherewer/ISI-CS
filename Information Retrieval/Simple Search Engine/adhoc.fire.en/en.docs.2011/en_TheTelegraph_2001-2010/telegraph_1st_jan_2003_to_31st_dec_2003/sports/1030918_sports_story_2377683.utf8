The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, September 18, 2003  4 Day suspension for C. Alford 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT		 C. AlfordCalcutta: The Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) stewards, on Wednesday, handed jockey Cristopher Alford a four-day suspension for riding an injudicious race on the Derby favourite Aretino  owned by Deepak Khaitan.				 										The stewards, perhaps, felt the jockey had kept the 6-10 hot-favourite too far behind the field, and thus left the No Louder-Lady Cox son too much to do in the home stretch. Aretino, however, managed to place second behind the winner Accuser, his less fancied owner-mate.				 										Alfords suspension starts from September 27 and concludes on November 13. The jockey is, however, likely to appeal. A reduced sentence of two meets will enable Alford to accept rides after October 8, the last day of the monsoon season.

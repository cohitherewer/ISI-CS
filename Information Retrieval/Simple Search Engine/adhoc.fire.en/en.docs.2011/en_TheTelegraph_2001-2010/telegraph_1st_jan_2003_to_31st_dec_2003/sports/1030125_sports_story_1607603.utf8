The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 Salas unsure of Chile future
																								Santiago: Chiles Marcelo Salas said he lacked confidence in his countrys soccer directors and hinted he might reject a call-up to play in the 2006 World Cup qualifiers.																								But, in a conflicting story, the association which controls football in Chile, said Salas had told national coach Juvenal Olmos he was ready to help rebuild the side which finished bottom of the South American qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup.																								Salas told a Santiago daily he was still owed money from previous internationals. To be truthful, I dont have the confidence to start the process all over again, the Juventus striker said.																								After so much time without playing for the national team and enjoying the tranquillity of just worrying about my club, its difficult to think again about the possibility of facing a couple of years of qualifiers.

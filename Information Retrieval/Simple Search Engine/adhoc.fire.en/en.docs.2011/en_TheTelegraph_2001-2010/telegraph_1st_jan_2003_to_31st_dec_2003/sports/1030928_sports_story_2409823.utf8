 Ferrero, Dent to clash for title
Bangkok, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Top seed Juan Carlos Ferrero blunted the serving power of Croatias Ivan Ljubicic to win 6-3, 6-3 on Saturday and set up a final with American Taylor Dent at the Thai Open. Dent reached his second final of the year after knocking out Finnish fifth seed Jarkko Nieminen 7-6, 6-2. Ljubicic was a shadow of the player that blasted 22 aces to upset home favourite Paradorn Srichaphan on Friday and put in a lacklustre performance against his Spanish opponent. With Ljubicic struggling to find his rhythm, the world No. 1 broke twice early to claim the first set. Ljubicic briefly rallied in the second, when he grabbed a break to go 2-1 ahead with a down-the-line winner, but immediately dropped serve to love in the fourth game. Ferrero later hinted that he may skip Januarys Australian Open.  Novak-Scud fight Top seed Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic will face Mark Philippoussis in the final of the Shanghai ATP meet. The Scud disposed of Robin Soderling 6-4, 6-4 in 67 minutes after Novak downed Wayne Arthurs 6-7 (7/9), 6-3, 6-2.  Copyright

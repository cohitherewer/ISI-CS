Midfielder Chitrasen Chandan Singhs powerful shot rebounded to striker Vimal Pariyar, who scored with a crisp and low shot. Gradually Salgaocar took over control by compressing the field and denying TFA opportunities to play their one-touch, speedy football. After a combined move, The Goa club equalised in the 39th minute, when Tomba on the left edge of the box, trapped a loose ball and scored with a swerving right footer to the far post. In the 53rd minute, an error prone TFA defence did not see left back Bello Rasak sneak in from the blind side during a corner kick. Rasak rose above the static defence and nodded home. TFA applied the pressure, but midfielder Bimal Birwa shot wide from close and Pariyars angular shot struck the crosspiece. Substitute Samson Singh scored twice in the 77th and 79th minutes, to complete the tally. He latched onto Ibrebros through and scored with an angular placement. Later he deflected in a rebound, after left midfielders Dharamjit Singhs try was partially cleared. TUESDAYs fixtures East Bengal vs Indian Bank, Chennai; Air India vs Jammu and Kashmir Bank.

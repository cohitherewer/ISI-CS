 Bengal seek revenge in final
Chennai: Bengal eves have a chance to avenge their past losses when they take on Manipur in the final of the 11th national womens football championship Tuesday. Defending champions Manipur will miss the services of attacker Bala Devi (out with two yellow cards) as well as some of their key players who were with the national team in the AFC meet in Bangkok recently. On the other hand, Bengal coach Shukla Dutta feels her team has shown good cohesion in earlier matches. My team doesnt have any injury problem and we will play positive football, she said.

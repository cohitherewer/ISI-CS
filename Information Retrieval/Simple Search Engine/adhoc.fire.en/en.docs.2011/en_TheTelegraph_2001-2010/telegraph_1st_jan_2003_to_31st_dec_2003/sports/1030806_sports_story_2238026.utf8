 Dravids 81 fails to save Scotland 
London: Indian vice-captain Rahul Dravids 81 went in vain as Scotland crashed to a seven wicket defeat to Hampshire in a National League one-day match at the Rose Bowl on Monday. Put in to bat, Scotland scored 225 for five wickets in 45 overs, with Dravid scoring his runs from 99 balls with the help of eight boundaries. Dravid, who steadied the Scots innings which was at one stage reeling at 65 for three, put on 103 for the fourth wicket with South Africas Jon Kent (78 not out).  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pakistan make it 4-0 
Rawalpindi: A fluent century opening stand between Imran Farhat and Yasir Hameed set up a comfortable seven-wicket win for Pakistan over New Zealand in the fourth ODI on Friday. The two youngsters scored half centuries to make a victory target of 184 runs look easy with a stand of 134 from 166 balls. It was their second successive century partnership of the series, which Pakistan now lead 4-0 with one match to play. Farhat and Hameed were in such dominant form that they brought up 50 in the 7th over and 100 in the 20th over. Earlier, Pakistan bowled the tourists out for 183, Shoaib Akhtar taking three for 23.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A collective failure: Sourav 
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav: Runs the issue, not batting order Centurion: From being among the more successful captains on the circuit, Sourav Ganguly has been reduced to presiding over a string of defeats  the win over Holland doesnt count for much. And, the strain is showing. I know I havent been getting runs, I also know others arent getting runs. However, its a collective failure and I wouldnt like fingers to be pointed at anybody, he insisted, during the Media conference after a walloping at the hands of Australia. Repeatedly asked about the batting order (as if shifting Virender Sehwag to No.3 has been the most extraordinary decision), Sourav countered with a perfectly reasonable answer: Today, the issue is getting runs  in whatever position  not the batting order. The captain added: I do realise, of course, that I should be the first person to score... We have a few days break and that will offer time to go over many things. Later, speaking to The Telegraph, Sourav didnt quite agree that he was unusually tense before the Pool A game got underway. I was keen, fiercely keen... I wasnt tense, quot; he maintained. Well, till the captain gets back among the runs, the pressure will only increase.  Copyright

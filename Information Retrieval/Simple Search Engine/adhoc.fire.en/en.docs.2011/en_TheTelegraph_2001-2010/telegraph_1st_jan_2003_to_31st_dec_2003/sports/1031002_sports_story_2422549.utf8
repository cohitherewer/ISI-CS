 Sledging may lead to life ban
Sydney: Australian cricketers would now face a life ban for sledging under a new code of behaviour policy as the countrys board makes an effort to lift the games domestic and international image. Under the new policy, assault and racial and religious vilification are considered the most serious breaches and will be punishable by a ban of between five Test matches and/or 10 ODIs and a life ban, a web-site report said. Cricket Australia (CA) has revealed that pressure for the change came after the clash between Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath and West Indies batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan earlier this year. Growing pressure from various quarters has led to the CA meeting with the national and state teams this week which addressed Australias leading cricketers on four specific areas: code of behaviour, racial and religious vilification, drugs and harassment. Under the proposed code of behaviour for on-field misdemeanours, players can receive suspended ban of up to one multi-day match and/or two one-day matches for abusing cricket equipment or clothing, show dissent at an umpires decision, use obscene language, engage in excessive appealing, celebrate a dismissal before the decision has been given and point towards the pavilion in an aggressive manner upon the dismissal of a batsman. If the cricketer engages in physical contact with other players or officials, charges towards the umpire when appealing and throws the ball near a player or official, it could attract a fine equivalent to between 50 per cent to full match fee and/or a ban of between one and two first-class matches and/or two and four one-day matches. For using language or gestures that offend, intimidate, threaten, disparage or vilify another person on the basis of that persons race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, a played could be banned for between two and four first-class matches and/or between four and eight one-dayers.

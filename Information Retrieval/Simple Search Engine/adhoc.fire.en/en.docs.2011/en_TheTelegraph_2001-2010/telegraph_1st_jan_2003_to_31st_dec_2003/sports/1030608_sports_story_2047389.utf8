The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sambaran for 4 points in win
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, June 7: A rethink on the points system was Bengal coach Sambaran Banerjees main suggestion at the Ranji coaches and captains meeting with BCCI technical committee chairman Sunil Gavaskar in Mumbai Friday. The former state captain said almost all who attended the meeting welcomed the new format, though most spoke in favour of returning to the old format in Duleep Trophy. The system introduced this year awarded two points for outright win and one for first-innings lead. On wickets we get here, its very difficult to bowl a side out twice. A win, thus, should be better rewarded. My suggestion was to award four points for a win, which was well received, said Sambaran. He informed that quality of wickets and standard of umpiring were among prominently discussed topics. Bishan Singh Bedi spoke strongly on the second, while Venkatesh Prasad criticised the kind of wickets available, Sambaran said.  Copyright

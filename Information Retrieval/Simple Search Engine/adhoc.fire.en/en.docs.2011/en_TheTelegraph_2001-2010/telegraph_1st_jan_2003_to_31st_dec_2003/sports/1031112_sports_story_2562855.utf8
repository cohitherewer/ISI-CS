The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Calcutta likely to host Super Cup
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Super Cup match between East Bengal and Mahindra United is most likely to be held in the city on November 19. Salt Lake Stadium will host the high-profile clash  featuring the National Football League champions and the Federation Cup toppers  provided Priya Ranjan Das Munshi approves the new venue. The All India Football Federation president, currently in the US, is expected back later this week. The third edition of this AIFF-organised game was scheduled to be held in Delhi on November 16. But with the Ambedkar Stadium not being available, the AIFF had to think of an alternative date and venue. The city will also host an important meeting on November 19. Members of the NFL organising committee, along with representatives of all 12 participating clubs, will meet that day at a city hotel to study the fixtures.  Copyright

 Junaid Zia pulled out of squad 
Karachi, Nov. 22 (AFP): Pakistan Cricket Board on Saturday pulled out its chiefs son from a 15-man national squad against New Zealand a day after his controversial selection triggered a wave of media criticism. The selectors accepted a request from Junaid Zia, son of PCB chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia, and pulled him out of the Pakistan team for the five-match one-day series against New Zealand, a PCB statement said. Junaids place was awarded to Umer Gul who had been initially selected in the Pakistan A team for next months one-day tri-series in India, the statement said. Junaid requested the selectors that he may be relieved from the one-day series so that he could appear in his academic examinations and would now replace Gul in Pakistan A squad for the December 13 to 21 event in India. Junaid was chosen from outside the pool of 23 probables after he took 35 wickets in four matches of a non-first class tournament.  Copyright

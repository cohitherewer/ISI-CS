The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jayasuriya to brave injury for India tie
- First 15 overs of each innings will hold key, feel rival captains FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sanath Jayasuriya watches his team during nets at the Wanderers Sunday. Despite a bruised left forearm and a chipped bone in his thumb, Jayasuriya will play in the crucial match against India Monday. (Reuters) Johannesburg: One way of looking at Mondays India versus Sri Lanka Super Six match is that its a quarter final for Sourav Gangulys team. A defeat, though, will not send India out of the World Cup; victory will seal a semi-final berth.In fact, the Lankans have much more to lose. Coach Dav Whatmore, however, is convinced even a defeat wont totally ruin chances of making the round-of-four. But, yes, he acknowledged it would be much easier if full points (four) were taken off India.That, of course, is easier said than done.It was learnt late Sunday that an unfit Hashan Tillekeratne will be replaced by Jehan Mubarak, while Prabath Nissanka will take Pulasthi Gunaratnes place.The Indians have peaked at quite the right time and five successive wins is creditable in any tournament, more so in the showpiece event. Conceding that, Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya said with a hint of envy: Theyve been steadily improving... Theyve been getting stronger.Jayasuriya, incidentally, is set to play even though he insisted he was only 80 per cent fit. Its a huge game for Lanka and, really, its inconceivable that Jayasuriya wont figure in the line-up. In any case, well-placed sources have confirmed he will take the field.Not doing so will, in effect, be gifting psychological territory.Assuming the Jayasuriya issue is resolved, Lankas top worry then is Mahela Jayawardenes form. He wasnt required to bat in two matches, but his highest in the remaining five is a mere nine (against the West Indies).Yet, the thinktank will be persisting with him  reason being he is a big occasion performer and could come good at a most critical moment in Lankas 2003 campaign.India have a somewhat similar problem, with Virender Sehwag managing a best of 36 (versus Zimbabwe) in seven games. Ive spoken to him, one-to-one, and conveyed he must build on every start. For example, he has got into the 20s four times, Sourav told The Telegraph.While the Indians will field the XI which beat Kenya at Newlands, the Lankan side may see two changes. Hashan Tillekeratne has a hamstring problem and, if he isnt fit, will have to make way for Jehan Mubarak. Then, theres talk that quick Pulasthi Gunaratne could be replaced by Prabath Nissanka.Even if theres a change, the Lankans will be relying on the in-form Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Express Fernando to try and soften the Indians. Only, its to be seen whether one of them or the wily Muttiah Muralidharan will make the biggest impact.The Wanderers is known to help the quicker bowlers and, so, even Ashish Nehra may make an excellent impression. He has been bowling superbly and appears more hungry than Zaheer Khan. The pick, however, has been veteran Jawagal Srinath.While the captains feel the team which plays better over the 100 overs will take the honours, the first 15 of each innings should make the biggest difference. Indeed, the match will be won and lost there.Meanwhile, it rained rather heavily Sunday, after the teams completed their workout, but the forecast only speaks of cloudy conditions. Thats some relief as nobody would like the elements to spoil yet another India-Lanka game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka notch up 563/5
Colombo, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Thilan Samaraweera and Mahela Jayawardene were in rampant form as they notched up centuries against a lacklustre England attack on the third day of the deciding third Test on Saturday. The duo helped Sri Lanka score a formidable 563 for five at the close of play in reply to Englands modest 265. The hosts, starting the day on 264 for two, posted their second highest innings total against the tourists to establish a commanding 298-run lead. The third-wicket stand between Samaraweera and Jayawardene was the highest-ever stand at the SSC for any wicket and a record third-wicket stand against England, surpassing the 243 compiled by Jayasuriya and Aravinda de Silva at The Oval, 98. Englands players, kept awake into the early hours of the morning by a noisy party at their team hotel, were frustrated by series of dropped catches and close leg before decisions turned down. Jayawardene finished with 134 from 246 balls, having hit 14 fours and a six. It was his 10th Test ton and his first for 18 months.  Copyright

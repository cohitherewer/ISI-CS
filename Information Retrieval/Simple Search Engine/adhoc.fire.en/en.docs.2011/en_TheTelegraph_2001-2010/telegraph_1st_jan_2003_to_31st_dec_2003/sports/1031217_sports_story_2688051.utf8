The Telegraph - Calcutta
 South Africa too hot for WI
 - First test - Nel fined for obscene gesture; Both captains feel the pinch too  Makhaya Ntini, who had a 9-wkt match-haul, celebrates Tuesday Johannesburg: Shivnarine Chanderpauls defiant 74 proved in vain as South Africa beat the West Indies by 189 runs in the first Test on Tuesday. The tourists were dismissed for 188 having been set a victory target of 378. Chanderpaul held firm for more than two hours, facing 91 balls and hitting 13 fours, but the West Indies were on the rack when paceman Shaun Pollock had him caught by Andre Nel at fine leg in the eighth over after lunch. Pollock took four for 31, while fast bowler Makhaya Ntini claimed four for 53. Ntini took nine wickets in the match. The West Indies resumed on 31 for three and slipped to 41 for four in the fifth over of the day when Pollock trapped Ramnaresh Sarwan in front for eight. In his next over, Pollock took the key wicket of Brian Lara, who scored 202 in the first innings, when the West Indies captain dragged a wide delivery on to his stumps to be bowled for five. Chanderpaul and Ridley Jacobs took the visitors to lunch with solid batting. They were separated three overs into the second session when Nel bowled Jacobs for 25 to end a sixth-wicket stand of 98. Chanderpaul fell five overs later, and the West Indies dwindled to 176 for eight just eight balls later when Chris Gayle edged Nel to Mark Boucher. Ntini took his fourth by bowling Mervyn Dillon for seven, and the match ended when Pollock had Corey Collymore leg-before wicket for a duck.  Multiple penalties Andre Nel was fined half of his match fees for sticking out the tongue to Chris Gayle after dismissing him on Tuesday. Acting on a complaint by third umpire Brian Jerling, Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle conducted a disciplinary hearing and charged Nel under a section of the ICC Code of Conduct which bars players from making an obscene gesture. Graeme Smith and Lara had their pockets pinched too as they fell foul of a new get-tough policy on slow over-rates. Smith was slapped a fine of 30 per cent of his match fee because his team were three overs behind the required minimum of 15 overs an hour. His teammates were fined 15 per cent of their fees.  Lara was fined 10 per cent of  his fee because his side was one over behind. His teammates  lost five per cent. (Reuters)  Copyright

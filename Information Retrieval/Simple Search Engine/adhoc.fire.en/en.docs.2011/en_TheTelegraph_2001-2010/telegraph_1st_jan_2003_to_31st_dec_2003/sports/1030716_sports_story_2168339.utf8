 India may host F1: Ecclestone
New Delhi: Michael Schumacher could soon be burning the tracks in India, according to Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone, who believes the country could become a F1 venue. We will be having an F 1 race in India for sure, Ecclestone was quoted as saying in an Indian magazine. India is moving forward very fast. After we do something in China, India is next. Formula One has caught the imagination of millions in cricket-crazy India ever since the races began to be beamed live on television a few years ago. But this is the first time serious efforts are being made to make India a stop on the circuit. Hyderabad is being touted as a possible Formula One venue, although Ecclestone stressed no official moves had yet been made to organise the event in India. But we have been speaking to intermediaries, he said. So they know we are interested. I need to go and have a look.  (AFP)  Copyright

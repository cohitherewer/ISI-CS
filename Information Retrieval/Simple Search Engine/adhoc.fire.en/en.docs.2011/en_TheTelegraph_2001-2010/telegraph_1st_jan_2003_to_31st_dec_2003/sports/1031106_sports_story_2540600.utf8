 Coaching part of Sunny plans
Mumbai: Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar said on Wednesday that coaching was definitely part of his future plans after being chosen for the Castrol lifetime achievement award. I hope I will not become complacent after winning two lifetime achievement awards in a week (CEAT and Castrol) as I would like to contribute little more to the game as an administrator and, in future, as a coach, Gavaskar said. It is a big honour to win this one as they (Castrol) were the first to introduce such awards in Indian cricket and I am looking forward to receiving it at a function in Bangalore on Monday, he added.

 Gillespie under injury cloud
Johannesburg: Concerns are growing over Jason Gillespies World Cup participation after the Australia fast bowler was sent for a scan on his sore right Achilles on Tuesday. The injury, which has kept Gillespie out of the world champions last two matches against Namibia and England, has failed to respond to treatment. It hasnt improved since the problem initially occurred and that is not ideal, team physiotherapist Errol Alcott said on Tuesday. It is hard to speculate on how he is until we get the test results back within the next 48 hours. We would expect to know more about the immediate future when the results of the scan come through. The injury was originally thought to be relatively minor and Gillespies absence from the game against Namibia was said to be precautionary. However, the problem flared up again on Saturday when Gillespie broke down in training before the match against England and that has led to the decision to get the Achilles scanned. For Gillespie the injury is the latest in a series of fitness problems that have dogged his career. The fast bowler was ruled out of the 1999 World Cup with a back injury and missed much of the 1999-2000 season after suffering a broken leg and a broken wrist in a collision with Steve Waugh during a Test in Sri Lanka. It has been disappointing to miss the past two games especially as my form and fitness had been good up to the Namibia game, Gillespie said on Tuesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

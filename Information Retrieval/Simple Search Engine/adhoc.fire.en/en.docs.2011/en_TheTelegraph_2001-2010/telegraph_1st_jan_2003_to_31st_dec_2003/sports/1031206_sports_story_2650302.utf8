 Emphasis was on hitting the deck: Zaheer
 Zaheer feels Bruce Reids inputs have helped Brisbane: Zaheer Khan laid to rest the demons of bowling to the mighty Australians with a five-wicket haul which also anointed him as Indias pace spearhead at the Gabba on Friday. Zaheer has been a targeted bowler for Australia in recent past in one-dayers but the left-arm pacer shook off the psychological damage, if any, with an inspired spell which allowed India a rare dominance over the world champions. Zaheer credited his success to his no-holds-barred approach on a gloomy day. I didnt want to sacrifice my pace, line or length even if it meant I was bowling a lot of no-balls, said Zaheer having transgressed the bowling crease no less than 12 times. Zaheer said his emphasis was on hitting the seam and the deck consistently. Fast bowling is all about bowling consistently in right areas and no matter who the batsman is, he would struggle to find an answer to it. One of Zaheers dismissals was that of Steve Waugh who treaded on to his stumps in trying to avoid a rising delivery on the leg stump. The ball was getting wet and difficult to grip and our request for a different ball was granted. He (Waugh) is a very good batsman and it felt good to claim his wicket. Zaheer praised Bruce Reid for the advice he has offered in the last few days in terms of areas to bowl to Australian batsmen. He has suggested the basics and the right areas to bowl to batsmen in these conditions.  (PTI)  Copyright

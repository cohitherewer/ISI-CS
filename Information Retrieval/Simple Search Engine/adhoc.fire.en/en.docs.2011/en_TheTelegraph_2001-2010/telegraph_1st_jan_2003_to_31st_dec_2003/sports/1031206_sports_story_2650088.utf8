 Becks: La Liga better than Premiership 
 David Beckham during a radio interview in Madrid on Thursday. (AP) Madrid: David Beckham has only been a Real Madrid player for a little over five months but he is already convinced that Spanish football is the best. Spain is the best league in the world and it is incredible to be here, Beckham told a Spanish radio station on Thursday. The views are an abrupt U-turn from those he regularly uttered during his 11-year career with reigning English champions Manchester United when he regularly commented that there was nothing to be compared with the English Premiership. And Im lucky to play for a team that is in contention for everything and playing such good football, added the England captain about his present employers. Ive adapted very quickly. The only club I would have left Manchester United for was Real. Although I had offers from Barca I decided to come here where I could play with people like Figo, Ronaldo, Raul or Zidane. The question now is, will more British players make their way to Spain after Beckhams publicity for La Liga? In the last seven years, the only British players to play in the top flight of Spanish football have been English internationals Beckham and Steve McManaman at Real and also the former Everton and Tottenham defender Vinny Samways, who plied his trade at Las Palmas and Sevilla. Beckham admitted he was surprised that it turned out to be the former Manchester United assistant coach Carlos Queiroz who was chosen to take over at the reigning Spanish champions after the controversial decision not to renew the contract of former coach Vicente Del Bosque.

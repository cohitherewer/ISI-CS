		 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Boys want a break: Hussain
																								Sydney: England captain Nasser Hussain says his exhausted players want to snatch a break between the end of the one-day tri-series in Australia and the World Cup.																								Theres three or four days break between the end of this tournament and the beginning of the World Cup, Hussain said at the SCG on Thursday. 																								Some of the boys have asked me, as captain, if they can pop home for three or four days to empty their suitcases after three or four months away, clear Australia out of their system, start afresh and get on a fresh flight to South Africa, Hussain said.

 Iraqs German coach wants to return
 bernd stange: Not Saddams man Berlin: After leaving Baghdad in a hurry just before the war started, German coach Bernd Stange now hopes to gather Iraqs national soccer team together for a series of post-war international friendlies. Football for me represents peace and thats why we should get back to playing again as soon as possible, said Stange, 54, who signed a four-year contract to coach Iraq last year. Id like to get my team together and go on an international tour with them, perhaps to London or other cities. Right up to the war they kept playing the championship, theyre all fit. Theyre professional sportsmen but theyre not getting whats needed there now, lacking water and proper nutrition, Stange said in an interview. He stayed in telephone contact with his assistants and Iraqi football association officials until a few days after the war started and knew first division matches were being played up until Baghdad was invaded by US forces in early April. The telephone network has been badly damaged and its impossible to get through right now, he SAID. The national team kept training right up until the war reached Baghdad but after that it was no longer possible to practise. Stange said Olympic qualification matches with Vietnam set for April had been postponed indefinitely by Fifa due to the war. He believes Iraq still have an excellent chance of reaching the World Cup finals in 2006. We were ahead of Scotland, Wales and Austria in the Fifa rankings in February and ranked fifth in Asia, Stange said. We have a good team that plays well together, Kurds, Shiites, Sunnis and Christians all play in harmony on the pitch. Saddams payroll Rejecting suggestions he might not be allowed to coach because he was on Saddam Husseins payroll, Stange said he had never met or had anything to do with the ousted Iraqi President or his son Uday, the head of Iraqs football association and Olympic committee. Stange drew widespread criticism in Germany for posing for a photograph during his contract negotiations in Baghdad last year in front of a giant Saddam portrait. I never had any contact at all with Saddam or Uday, Stange bristled. Their names arent on any of my or contracts. My contact has been with the Iraq football association and FA vice president.

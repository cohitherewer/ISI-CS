The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mumbai thrash Baroda, in final
			Mumbais Sairaj Bahutule, who bagged 5 for 21		Vadodara: Mumbai scored a thumping innings and 138 runs victory over last years runners-up Baroda in the Ranji Trophy semi-final match at the GSFC grounds, here on Sunday. Barodas second innings lasted barely 127 minutes, with the team losing nine wickets for 106 runs off 43.2 overs to be all out for 122. Mumbais Sairaj Bahutule bagged five wickets for 21 runs. Mumbai, who have entered the final after three years, will meet the winner of the Tamil Nadu-Delhi game. Baroda, who were bowled out for 130 in their first innings, conceded a 260-run lead to Mumbai who had scored 390. Resuming at overnight score of 16 for loss of captain Connor Williams (6), Baroda lost three wickets in quick succession and were soon reduced to 40 for four. Overnight batsmen Satyajit Parab and Rakesh Solanki lasted only five overs when play resumed this morning. Avishkar Salvi broke the partnership bowling Parab for 36. That opened the floodgates as Baroda failed to withstand the fine bowling of Bahutule, Agarkar and Powar and lost wickets at regular intervals. Delhi-TN in dead heat Meanwhile, in New Delhi, Tamil Nadu lost four quick wickets in the second innings as their semi-final clash against Delhi headed for an exciting finish at the Kotla. Bowlers dominated as the batsmen struggled to put up decent scores on the third day, which witnessed 10 wickets from both the sides tumbling under overcast conditions. After bowling out Delhi for 256 in the morning, Tamil Nadu closed the day at 88 four to take an overall lead of 159. With six wickets intact, Tamil Nadu would be looking to put up a good score to defend though their fortunes would largely depend on the two men at the crease  S. Ramesh and S. Sharath, batting on 20 and five, respectively. The visiting captain S. Suresh surprisingly opened the second innings with Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan in place of the in-form Sadagoppan Ramesh, who top-scored in the first essay with a patient 82. Despite the change, they got off to a poor start as Sivaramakrishnan was dismissed for a duck in the fourth ball of the innings, snapped up by keeper Vijay Dahiya off Amit Bhandari. When S. Sriram and Hemang Badani returned to the pavilion in quick succession, leaving the side at 53 for three, the visitors were in deep trouble. Though wickets were falling regularly at the other end, Suresh tackled the uneven bounce with patience and grit. His vigil came to an end when he was caught behind by Dahiya off S. S. Negi. Earlier, Negi and last man Bhandari saved the home side the blushes as they compiled 62 runs for the last wicket to take Delhi past the 250-mark  SUMMARISED SCORES n In New Delhi: Tamil Nadu 327 amp; 88/4.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 City to host A tri-series
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 15: The city will see some of the best talents in the sub-continent when the A sides of India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka play a tri-series from December 14-21. Announcing this, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Saturday: The tournament was originally scheduled for Bangalore, but it had to be rescheduled. Australian sports psychologist Sandy Gordon will be in the city when India play Australia. He is currently in India interacting with some senior players as well as the juniors. He will make a detailed report and we want to give him a feel of the Eden Gardens and the passion of cricket in the country, Dalmiya said. He, however, ruled out any chances of a Gordon session with the Indian team before the final. But India will have sessions with Gordon when they tour Down Under. The president added that CA chairman Bob Merriman, BCB president Ali Asghar and ACC chief executive Ashraf-ul Haq will also be present during the final. Also Erapalli Prasanna, S. Venkatraghavan and Bishan Singh Bedi will be present and there will be a spinners conclave a day after the final.  Copyright

 Pybus not to seek fresh deal 
Johannesburg: World Cup coach Richard Pybus said Saturday he would not be seeking a new deal with Pakistan after the teams World Cup failure. He also suggested the team might need a home-grown coach to fulfil its potential. Pybus said over phone from East London: Im not down but it was incredibly frustrating. From a coaching point of view, I was not able to help improve the teams performance as I wanted to. My contract ran out at the end of the World Cup campaign and Ill now take some time to think things over. (Reuters)  Copyright

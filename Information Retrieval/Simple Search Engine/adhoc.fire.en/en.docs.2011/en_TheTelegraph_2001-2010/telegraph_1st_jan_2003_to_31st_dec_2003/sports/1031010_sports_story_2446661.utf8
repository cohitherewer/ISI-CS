The Telegraph - Calcutta
 4-way race for title 
New Delhi: GM Marat Dhzumaev of Uzbekistan turned the title race into a four-way affair on Friday when he beat top seed GM Dmitry Svetushkin of Moldova in the tenth and penultimate round of the Parsvnath international meet. Dhzumaev shares the lead with GMs P. Harikrishna, Alexander Fominyh and GM-in-waiting R.B. Ramesh with eight points each. Ramesh played a draw against Scot GM Jonathan Rowson. The Indian has the best chance of clinching the title as he only needs to match the result of his three fellow-leaders to win the championship on a better progressive score. The Delhi Chess Association have applied to the All India Chess Federation for certification of this tournament as a norm-meet so that the third and final GM norm of Ramesh and IM norms of some other players could be confirmed. We have informed the AICF that we will be playing the Rs 1 lakh-odd fee for converting the meet into a norm tournament, an official said. The 27-year-old Ramesh, who got his IM title in 1996, was elated and relieved after achieving the final norm. On the top board, overnight leaders Fominyh and Harikrishna opted to play safe and agreed to a draw after 21 moves. With just a round remaining, 12 players including GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Rowson, IM Lanka Ravi, Neelotpal Das are in the second spot with 7.5 points.  (PTI)  Copyright

 BTTA considers legal action
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA) may explore legal options against a looming threat of de-affiliation from the national body. We are yet to receive any intimation from Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) in this regard, but we are certainly keeping that (legal) option open, said a BTTA official on Saturday. Confirming that the national association is going to take strong action against the state body, TTFI vice-president Prabir Mitra said that a letter  stating the formation of an ad-hoc body and de-affiliation of BTTA  would be sent to the state body within a week.It may be recalled that during last months national ranking championship (East zone), TTFI secretary M.C. Chowhan held a meeting with the warring factions of BTTA and tried them to bring under the same roof. But that effort bore no fruit and Chowhan, then, threatened to take action against the state body citing that the game as a whole was being affected by the in-fighting. The East Zone meet, incidentally, was organised by CoE, instead of BTTA.  Copyright

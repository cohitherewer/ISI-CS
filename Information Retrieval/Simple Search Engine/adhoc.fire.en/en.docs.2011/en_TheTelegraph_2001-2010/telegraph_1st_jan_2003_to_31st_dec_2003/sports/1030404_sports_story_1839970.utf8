The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The missing courtside link
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The well-manicured centre court, the temporary stands, a buzz of activity and a horde of hangers-on eager to acquire their favourites autographs. The South Club wore a typically busy look on the eve of another Davis Cup tie. There was one missing link though: Jaidip Mukerjea. The man who was involved with all nine previous ties at the Mecca of Indian tennis  either as a player, organiser or captain  has been conspicuous by his absence in the build-up to the India versus New Zealand encounter. And he has no plans of dropping in at the venue to watch the matches live over the next three days either, it was learnt. According to an insider, Mukerjea cut down on his visits to the club considerably after losing the elections a few months ago. He was not available for comment. Jaidip was nominated on the organising committee for this tie also, but there was no response from his end. His accreditation card and tickets were sent to his residence only to be refused.

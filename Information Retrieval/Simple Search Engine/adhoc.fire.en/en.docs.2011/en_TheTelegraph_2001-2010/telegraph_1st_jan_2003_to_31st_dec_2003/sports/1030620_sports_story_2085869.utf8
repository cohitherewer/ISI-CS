The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sponsor proposal likely to be vetoed
New Delhi: The sponsor of the national cricket team, Sahara India is planning a joint India-Pakistan outfit to play against a Rest of the World side in the United Kingdom on August 15, Indias Independence Day. According to Sahara, the aim of the match to promote harmony between the two nations. We have put forward the proposal to the cricket board for consideration. It is a novel thought mooted by our chairman, Saharas senior manager-corporate communications said on Thursday. The match, christened the Peace Cup, aims at fostering global peace through cricket. Representing India in the joint team would be Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif, Zaheer Khan and Parthiv Patel. The Pakistani component would be made up by Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Moin Khan and Saqlain Mushtaq. Though Saharas event managers, Percept DMark, are awaiting the BCCIs no-objection certificate for the six short-listed players, it is unlikely they will get the nod. In fact, a top Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official has dismissed as premature the Sahara proposal. As things stand today, the idea in all likelihood will be shot down in the Working Committee meeting, the top official said, on condition of anonymity.  (PTI)  Copyright

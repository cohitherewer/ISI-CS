 WI drop Dillon for third tie
Kingstown (St Vincent): West Indies have left out Mervyn Dillon for Wednesdays third and final ODI against Sri Lanka. Teenager Jerome Taylor has been drafted into the one-day squad to replace Dillon, who will be rested for the two-match Test series, a spokesman for the WICB said Tuesday. Taylor, 18, impressed the West Indies selectors by taking 21 wickets in six games in the recent domestic season. However, he has played a single one-day game at senior level and is unlikely to be named in the final eleven ahead of fellow Jamaican pace bowler Daren Powell. Dillon normally spearheads the West Indies attack and is the only member of the current squad who has taken more than 100 wickets at international level. THE TEAMS West Indies (from): Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Omari Banks, David Bernard, Corey Collymore, Vasbert Drakes, Chris Gayle, Wavell Hinds, Ryan Hurley, Ridley Jacobs, Daren Powell, Ricardo Powell, Marlon Samuels, Devon Smith, Jerome Taylor Sri Lanka (from): Maravan Atapattu, Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Naveed Nawaz, Upul Chandana, Chaminda Vaas, Dharshana Gamage, Prabath Nissanka, Kaushal Lokuarachchi, Kumar Dharmasena, Muttiah Muralidharan, Dinusha Fernando.

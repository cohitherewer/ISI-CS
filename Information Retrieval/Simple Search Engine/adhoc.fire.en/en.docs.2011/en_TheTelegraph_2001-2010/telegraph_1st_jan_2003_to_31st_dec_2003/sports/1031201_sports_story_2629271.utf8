 Womens Test ends in draw
Vapi: The one-off Test between India and New Zealand women ended in a tame draw on Sunday. Having conceded a first innings lead of 76 runs, the visitors played out the final day to reach 102 for the loss of four wickets with opener M. Fahey top-scoring with an unbeaten 60. For the hosts, Nitu David was the chief wicket-taker with three for 35 in 37 overs. Earlier, India had made 277 in reply to New Zealands 201 in the first innings. Hemlata Kala, whose 110 was instrumental in India gaining the first innings lead, was declared Woman of the Match. Anju Jain of India was declared as the Best Batswoman and Rebecca Steel of New Zealand the Best Bowler.  But, Fahey was clearly the player of the day, defying  the home team spinners on a final day pitch after her team  was reduced to 37 for four. At one stage they didnt score  for more than ten overs, but thier application was exceptional.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ATP probing fixing scandal
London: The ATP was reported to be investigating claims that some of the players are deliberately throwing matches in a huge betting scandal. The Sunday Telegraph claimed that the players  all men  are understood to have been involved in bets of thousands of pounds on the result of their own matches. The report claimed bets are placed via coaches and other intermediaries with internet betting exchanges. The penalty for any player found guilty of match-fixing would be $100,000 plus whatever money he made from the bet and a three-year suspension, said an ATP official. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Theres no creative play today... Just structured coaching: Greg Chappell
 - This is one of the weakest periods for bowling in a long, long time and the one-day game is responsible  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Greg Chappell doesnt agree with this business of flat wickets for the maximum runs Adelaide: Some havent forgotten Greg Chappell asking younger brother Trevor to bowl underarm in a one-dayer against New Zealand, an act he has regretted, but everybody else remembers him as the most cultured batsman of his era. Actually, the Sachin Tendulkars grew up idolising Greg and his place among the all-time greats is assured. More recently, Greg has been into coaching and, had a deal been struck in late 2000, he would today have been wearing John Wrights hat. Among the most articulate of his fraternity, Greg spoke to The Telegraph for half-an-hour on Sunday morning. He was, to put it mildly, passionate about every point he made. The following are excerpts Q Two decades after quitting, how do you look at cricket today? A I dont think it has gone from strength to strength, but there are a lot of positives... Equally, there have been negatives. Financially and otherwise, the game is strong in India and Australia, but not so elsewhere. Thats a worry and it doesnt help if two of the top countries  England and the West Indies  remain down for a length of time. But, quality-wise, are the current cricketers better? Im not going to criticise the modern-day players... The batting certainly has improved, because batsmen have become more positive, thanks to the one-day game... Its probably a reflection of society, where people now go out with a degree of confidence... Having said that, one-day cricket hasnt helped bowling... Perhaps, this is one of the weakest periods for bowling in a long, long time and the one-day game is responsible. I mean, the bowlers only think of trying to minimise the damage... Are reconciled to being fodder for batsmen... However, the best way of keeping runs down is getting wickets... It could be cyclical, but... Moreover, I dont quite agree with this business of flat wickets for the maximum runs. Rather, at all levels, we should have good cricket wickets. The game is best showcased when theres a balance between bat and ball. Is captaincy also suffering because of one-day cricket? Absolutely... For example, the on-going Test is only Indias fourth of the year... Thats incredible... Believe me, its very hard for captains to get into the mental side of captaincy if there are so few five-day matches... Because the one-day game is so formatted, captaincy gets lessened... Its such a predictable thing and, therefore, the skills of captaincy arent encouraged. Eventually, that gets reflected in Test cricket. To what extent can an academy structure help? Australia, at least, gained by Rod Marshs decade at the Commonwealth Bank-sponsored one here... There are dangers in having a formatted approach, but Marsh encouraged cricketers to be positive... Encouraged the batsmen to play shots... Really, the present generation owes much to him. Essentially, over the last two decades, how different has the players approach become? Has changed because the administration-driven demands are different... A minimum number of overs must be bowled, time lost is to be made up... The pace is quicker, which is very different from the time the West Indies used slow over rates as a tactic... Looking back, the changes began even before I left, after the (Kerry) Packer years... Talking of batting, the highest individual record has been rewritten twice in less than a decade... Is it easier breaking records? Well, I wouldnt be comfortable commenting... As Ive said, though, the batsmen are more positive and thats a plus from the one-day game. Should cricketers be judged on Test performance only? Ought to be the sole judging area but, then, what happens to a Michael Bevan? Fifty years on, cricket will look different... (After a pause) If cricket is to grow and become a global sport, then weve got to come up with something shorter than even 50 overs for each team... Im not sure, but 20-20 could be an answer... Again, however, the art of bowling will get diminished... Fact is cricket has to survive and must provide what the modern-day spectator wants. Its a challenge. Do we actually have a stand-out batsman in the present times? Yes... Sachin Tendulkar... Ill also pick Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting and Adam Gilchrist... The stand-out batsmen play both forms equally well, thats the beauty. Not too long ago, you coached South Australia for five years... How was that transition? I learnt a lot... I found it stimulating, found it enjoyable... Its another matter that we didnt have much success... Not that it reflects on the players or, for that matter, on me... (Pauses again) What alarmed me is much of the stuff that had become part of the folklore of coaching... I grew up in a distinctly different environment... Yes, there was some basic coaching, but lots of creative play... I grew up in an unstructured era... Yet, now, theres no creative play... Just lots of structured coaching... Im convinced this is the wrong path and this issue needs to be quickly addressed... Getting out cant be treated as terminal. So, what should a coach be doing? He must allow creativity... Must make an allowance for mistakes... Must allow the cricketers to learn from them (mistakes)... A coach must look at the past to work out what is best for the future. He must remember the greats of the past developed in a natural environment and, clearly, theres a lesson. In a modern way, we need to recreate that natural environment. The bottomline is simple: Change the training methods to allow freedom and creativity. Allow experiments... This is critical in the early stages of a players exposure to the game. Indeed, if we had coaches teaching kids how to walk, a lot of them wouldnt get off the ground! One learns to walk by falling and getting up, falling and getting up... With specialist coaches and so on, arent we encouraging a too-many-cooks situation? Too many misconceptions are being presented as facts... I agree that having too many cooks may cause problems... In any case, unproven theories cant be perpetrated... Also, this head-long rush into technology isnt something I welcome... Used as a tool, technology is excellent, but cant be the sole coaching instrument... That can be fatal. John Buchanan is seen more as manager, not a coach. Do you agree? Yes and I do believe thats the way to go about it... I think the American model of sport, with a manager at the top, is the right approach. Of course, once the cricketers are on the park, the captain is boss. Off and on, theres talk of a walkie-talkie hook-up between the captain and coach. Is that something for the near future? I wouldnt approve... On the field, its the captain alone who must direct and control the players... If I may add, while cricketers are being developed, they should also be taught the nuances of captaincy. At full strength, has this Steve Waugh-led team been the best ever? Thats subjective and so many considerations will come into play... All I can say is that its the best of this era, something thats reflected in the statistics. A good team or player of one era will be as good in any other. How much of a difference has Sourav Ganguly made to the Indian side? Plenty... John Wright too... Both are passionate about cricket, both have strong views... Quite honestly, I was very impressed with Souravs vision when he met me briefly for the first time earlier this year... Hes clear about his own game, is clear about where he wants to take Indian cricket. The last question: Is there a formula for success? (Laughs) There is, but Im not willing to reveal! Suffice to say the mental approach has a huge impact on the game. What you intend to do has a bearing on what happens... Im in the midst of writing a book and it will be more than a coaching manual.

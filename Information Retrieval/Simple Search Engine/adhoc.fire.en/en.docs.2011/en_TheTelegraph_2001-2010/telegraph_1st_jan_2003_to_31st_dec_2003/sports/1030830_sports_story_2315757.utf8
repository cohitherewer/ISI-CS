 - NATIONAL RANKING ARCHERY  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Satyadev equalled his world championship tally Calcutta: The first national ranking archery meet (second phase) got off to a roaring start at the SAI complex on Friday. As many as eight archers topped the 1,300-point mark in the Fita round competition, something unprecedented in the domestic circuit. The top five in the mens leaderboard all returned 1,300-plus scores, with UPs Satyadev Prasad managing 1317. Satyadev, the countrys most consistent performer in the last two years, thus equalled his world championship tally where India finished a creditable fourth. Young Mazi Swayan of Punes Army Sports Institute (ASI) totalled 1315, followed by another ASI competitor Tarundip Pal (1312). Veteran Limba Ram (1305) and Kailash (1301) took the next two spots. Leading the womens field of nine participants was Dola Banerjee with a score of 1309. Chekerovolu Sworu (1307) and Reena Kumari (1304) also crossed the magical mark. Completing the top five were Sumangala (1283) and Bhagyashri (1269). The Fita round is an 144-arrow affair over four distances  90m, 70m, 50m, 30m in mens and 70m, 60m, 50m, 30m in womens. Satyadev underlined his consistency, doing well in all but one of the categories  first in 50m with 335, third in 70m and 30m with 328 and 350, respectively. Dola, too, performed uniformly well. She was the best in 30m with 351, second in 60m (330), third in both 70m and 50m (314 each). This is a significant day in Indian archery. Eight scores over the magical figure of 1,300 have never been achieved in our country the norm is two, three or at the most four. Its a very rare occurrence for any tournament anywhere in the world, said Paresh Mukherjee, chairman of Archery Association of Indias technical committee.  This is the first of eight preparatory meets for next years Athens Olympics for which the Indian team has already qualified.

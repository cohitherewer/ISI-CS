Deportivo won 2-1. (Reuters) Paris: Real Madrids three kings of Raul Gonzalez, Ronaldo and Luis Figo ensured the reigning Spanish title-holders were crowned winter champions ahead of the Christmas break with a 3-1 win at Real Mallorca. Real have 39 points from 17 games, with Valencia second on 37 after their 1-0 win over Sevilla on Saturday. French Ligue 1 leaders Monaco were stung by a 0-1 defeat away to Rennes but Didier Deschamps side still hold a seven-point lead over champions Lyon, while in Italy AS Roma maintained their unbeaten record going into their three-week break with a 2-0 win at struggling Empoli. In German Bundesliga action, reigning champions Bayern Munich trail Werder Bremen by four points despite crushing poor SC Freiburg 6-0 ahead of their six-week winter break which started last Tuesday. Real, meanwhile, were rocked after 11 minutes when a mix up between defenders Ivan Helguera and Michel Salgado left Fernando Correa with a clear shot on goal which gifted Mallorca the lead. However, real always looked likely to score and had several chances during an entertaining first half before Raul equalised in injury time. Ronaldo then put the visitors ahead after 55 minutes, going past several Mallorca defenders, for his 14th goal of the season. Figo ensured all three points would be returning to the Spanish capital with Reals third goal from the spot on 68 minutes, after the former Spanish international Miguel Angel Nadal had tripped Ronaldo in the area. This was three important points, the players worked hard for them. I think we are entitled to feel happy because we played well and could have scored at almost any moment, said real coach Carlos Queiroz. AC Milan were beaten 1-2 by Udinese in the Italian League on Sunday, the European champions first loss of the season. Milans defeat, in a match where they missed a penalty and finished with ten men, and Juventus 1-1 draw with Lecce leave Roma heading into the winter break enjoying a six-point lead at the top of Serie A. Milans coach Carlo Ancelotti said: The truth is that we were facing a very good team and the fact Udinese took the lead immediately made it even more difficult a task. When we missed a penalty as well, we knew it was all going wrong. I must admit we are a little tired and the Christmas break is a welcome rest. Udinese arrived at the San Siro stadium on the back of three consecutive league wins and went ahead in the second minute when striker Dino Fava fired past Brazilian keeper Dida from the edge of the area. A clumsy challenge by Udinese keeper Morgan De Sanctis on Brazilian midfielder Serginho earned the home side a penalty, but midfielder Andrea Pirlos usual composure deserted him and he pushed the ball against the post. Udinese made it 2-0 six minutes after the interval when defender Nestor Sensini nodded Valerio Bertottos powerful free kick past Dida. Milans Brazilian winger Cafu pulled one back for the home side in the 70th minute, but the visitors withstood a period of late pressure to hold on for the win and go seventh, level with Parma on 24 points. Captain Francesco Totti struck both goals in Romas 2-0 win at Empoli, with Inter Milan missing a chance to take second by losing 1-2 at Lazio on Saturday. In France, Monaco were undone by Cedric Barbosa, his low shot three minutes after the interval leaving keeper Tony Silva with no chance. On-loan Spanish striker Fernando Morientes went close to equalising for Monaco minutes later, and then skipper Ludovic Giuly shot high with half an hour to go, allowing Rennes to hold on for a deserved victory. Middle of the table Rennes win was all the more noteworthy as they had to make do without strikers Alexander Frei (suspended) and Stephane Nguema (injured). Marseille carved out a hard fought 1-0 win over basement club Toulouse, reduced to ten men shortly after the start, but Alain Perrins faltering side are still some 12 points adrift of their south coast neighbours. Marseille, who only weeks ago were contending the French league title, had Didier Drogba to thank for the winning goal in the 62nd minute of a game.  United go top Meanwhile, Manchester United ended a stormy week for the club with a 2-1 win at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday that swept them to the top of the Premier League (as reported in our late city edition on Monday). United manager Alex Ferguson opted to include Rio Ferdinand two days after he was handed an eight-month ban for missing a drugs test. But the England defender had little to do in a game dominated by the champions, at least for the first hour. Ferdinand, who is expected to appeal against the ban which starts on January 12, was booed by the home fans but cheered by the visiting supporters. With Arsenal held 1-1 at Bolton on Saturday, United knew victory would take them a point clear of London rivals Arsenal and Chelsea going into the hectic holiday programme. It looked plain sailing after first-half goals from John OShea and Ruud van Nistelrooy put them in control. But the champions got a wake-up call in the 62nd minute when Paul Koncheskys deep cross was volleyed across the area by the impressive Stephane Dalmat and Poyet bundled in from close range. The home side then stepped up the pace with Dalmat and Frederic Kanoute applying some late pressure but United held out. Ferguson defended his decision to play Ferdinand, telling Sky Sports: I was very pleased with him. It was probably the best thing for him, to get everything out of his mind and concentrate on playing football. He acquitted himself very well in the circumstances.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

		 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 Greentop greets Bengal
				 	 Nikhil: Likely to open																								New Delhi: A green pitch awaits Bengal in their Ranji Trophy elite group A encounter against Delhi starting at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground Saturday.																								We have been playing on this green wicket throughout the season. We are going for results and this is a positive strategy, said Delhi captain Vijay Dahiya.																								You may have a good team but that may not be enough to get you the necessary points. Look where Railways (three points from five games) is, asked Dahiya.																								Delhi, placed second in the group after Mumbai, have seven points from five games while Bengal have two from five.																								Bengal coach Sambaram Banerjee informed batsman Nikil Haldipur is likely to open while Shabbir Ali will be the third seamer along with Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Ranadeb Bose. (PTI)

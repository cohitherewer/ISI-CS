 If you cant defend 300, you dont desrve to win: Badani
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Sri Lanka A captain Russell Arnold was delighted on two fronts after beating India A in the tri-series opener on Monday. Of course, he was happy to win after conceding 300. And then, the comeback by Nuwan Zoysa after going for 38 in two overs was also very pleasing. It was very good to see him come back the way he did. He was struggling initially, but showed the value of experience later. He is my main man in this attack and we were preparing for a total in the region of 350. He did a great job in helping us keep the Indian total well below that. We thought even 300 would be difficult but stayed positive. This has been a big confidence booster and shall help us do well in this tournament. We remain the third team in the competition still, with India at home and Pakistan being the other team, said Man-of-the-Match Arnold. India A skipper Hemang Badani admitted his team should have got 15-20 more, but refused to identify that as the decisive point. If you cant defend 300, on any pitch, you dont deserve to win. I feel our bowling, fielding and catching left a lot to be desired, said the left-hander.  Sriram for Minhas Delhi allrounder Mithun Minhas, substituting in place of Gautam Gambhir in the second session, has been ruled out for the rest of the meet after suffering a finger injury. He will be replaced by Tamil Nadus S. Sriram. Minhas hurt his left index finger while attempting to stop a ferocious cut at gully by Saman Jayantha. According to a BCCI release, the Delhi captain has suffered a crack in his finger.  Copyright

 Pollock has no excuse: Steve
Sydney: Australia Test captain Steve Waugh says Shaun Pollock has no excuse for South Africas shock firstround exit from the World Cup. It was obviously a breakdown of communication but in these days of professional sport where youre being paid good money, you shouldnt really make that mistake, Waugh said on Wednesday. South Africa tied their final rainaffected match against Sri Lanka on Monday in Durban to go out of the tournament. The home side were still wellplaced when heavy rain cut short the game. South Africa, on 229 for six, were one run short of the score required for victory under the DuckworthLewis scoring system for rainaffected run chases. As a captain, you get the (DuckworthLewis) printout at the end of the innings so you know exactly what the situation is, Waugh said. I think you can get it ballbyball, so I find it hard to believe that they had a mixup on that one. Pollock said after the game that 12th man Nicky Boje had been sent on the pitch to tell batsman Mark Boucher that 229 runs were enough to win. In reality, 230 were required. (Reuters)  Copyright

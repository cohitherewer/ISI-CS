The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachin should be left out of legal debate 
 - Everyone is convinced that if the maestro doesnt deserve an exemption, no one does, feels senior teammate  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sachin has been affected by the Ferrari controversy Bangalore: Perhaps, it has lots to do with his pucca upbringing. Or, there could be an element of personal conviction as well. Whatever be it, Sachin Tendulkar hasnt ever fallen out of line  even the Port Elizabeth incident was misconstrued. Yet, today, he is being bracketed with tax -evaders. Sachin himself wont talk about it but, as confidants point out, he has been affected by the Ferrari (Rs 1.13 crore customs duty exemption) controversy. Hes not at fault... Yet, his image continues to take a beating. Indeed, the longer this drags, the more unnecessary questions will be raised, is how a Mumbai-based confidant put it, when contacted by The Telegraph on Thursday. The matter is now in court, with the next hearing (in New Delhi) slated for September 23. According to that confidant, Sachin verbally approached the powers-that-be and formally applied for a waiver only after being advised to do so. Apparently, no assurance was really handed out. A few weeks ago, though, the government reverted that, in public interest, an exemption would be granted. The Ferrari  presented back in July, 2002  landed only after the go-ahead. The issue isnt about Sachin being wealthy enough to pay. Whats not being highlighted is that the powers-that-be bent no laws. The government has a discretionary allowance and has exercised that... Moreover, while Sachin didnt win the Ferrari in a competition, its a gift for an on-field achievement  equalling Sir Don Bradmans haul of 29 Test centuries. The presentation (from Fiat) had a purpose, another Mumbai-based confidant maintained. [While the maestro now has 31 centuries, his 29th was posted in Port-of-Spain during the 2001-2002 tour. That knock was worth 117.] Sachin, it may be recalled, was gifted the Ferrari (by F-I ace Michael Schumacher) in a symbolic presentation during last years British GP at Silverstone. The function was organised by Fiat (which is handling Ferrari operations), for whom Sachin is a brand ambassador. Significantly, Fiat has announced it will pick up the duty. Clearly, the auto giant hadnt bargained for such a controversy and, conscious of the damage being caused, went public with its decision within 24 hours of the Delhi High Court stepping into the picture. Actually, with everyones memory so short, nobody remembers that Sachin has been felicitated for being among the highest individual tax-payers in the country. Typically, he has never spoken about it. Look, if he was in the wrong, Sachin would have stood up and apologised...Thats the man he is... Sadly, he continues to be seen as a tax evader. Thats absurd...Its another matter that the powers-that-be should offer a waiver to all sportsmen, was the agitated comment of one of the confidants. Thats a valid point. In any case, if the discretion-bit (in the relevant Customs law) is to be re-examined, why must it be done at Sachins expense? He should be left out of the debate. Largely because the matter is in court, no teammate has jumped to Sachins defence. But, as somebody senior remarked the other evening, everyone is convinced that if Sachin doesnt deserve an exemption, absolutely nobody does. For now, at least this should give Sachin some comfort.

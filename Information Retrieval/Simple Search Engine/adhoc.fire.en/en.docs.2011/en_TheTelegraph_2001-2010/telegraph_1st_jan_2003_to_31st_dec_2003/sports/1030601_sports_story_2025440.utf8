The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Bengal in final
Margao, May 31 (Agencies): East Bengal reached the under-19 National Football League final with a 2-0 win over Dempo Saturday. The defending champions will take on JCT for the title Monday. After a barren first half in the semi-final encounter, East Bengal wing-back Satyajit Dutta scored the first goal from a corner-kick in the 49th minute before striker Prasanta Chakraborty completed the tally 15 minutes later. JCT beat Mahindra United 2-1 in the other match with a golden goal by Sunil Kumar. JCT were trailing 0-1 minutes before the final whistle in regulation time when Kulbir Singh scored the equaliser. Mahindra had taken the lead in the 25th minute through Sajid Ansari. Mahindra, who were impressive in the league phase, did not live up to expectations in the crunch game. They did get a chance to extend the lead just after the breather, but Neil Gaikwad failed with the goalkeeper to beat. JCT had beaten East Bengal 3-2 in a group league match in Calcutta earlier.

 Md. Sporting register first win
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Sheikh Sanjib nets 87th-minute winner  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sheikh Sanjib (left) evades Isiaka Awoyemis challenge to score at Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting earned their first National Football League victory with a 1-0 verdict against a depleted Tollygunge Agragami on Tuesday. Mohammedan Sporting, after six matches, have just four points, while Tollygunge stay at six from as many outings. In a display of unimaginative, pedestrian-level soccer at the Salt lake Stadium, the teams failed to score in the first half, and despite a certain level of dominance in ball-possession, Mohammedan Sporting could not push through the defensive set-up of Tollygunge. Added to that was the total lack of enterprise by the forward line, especially their star Dipendu Biswas. Coach Jamshed Nassiri substituted Dipendu with Sheikh Sanjib in the 78th minute. Sanjib scored the face-saving goal three minutes to time. Except for a couple of unplanned adventures around the rival box, mostly by Edeh Chidi, there wasnt much that could be termed an attack per se in the first half. In the 14th minute he travelled up the right with no lateral support and, running out of ideas at the goalmouth, was dispossessed. Then there was this interesting situation in which Chidi dived in the box and Tamil Nadu referee T. Pradeep Kumar ordered an indirect free-kick inside the box. It was wasted, though. Changing ends from pre-break boredom, there was that minute change in pace, but the drudgery came back, soon enough. In the fifth minute Syed Rahim Nabi messed up a clear chance, when he shot over from close a ricochet off the crossbar after Bungo Singh had found the woodwork with a rising shot. Nabi was a mere shadow of his former self, barely being able to keep his feet on the ground, leave alone the game-making the player was once known for. Then there was this Dipendu mess. In a 70th-minute goalmouth melee, Dipendu received a high pass from the left, the ball landing near his feet. He had the time to control and to connect. But he failed to react. Biswas substitution was expected, adding a little more pace. Tollygunge coach Krishnendu Roy, on the other hand  dealing with a lack of four-five of his top players  pulled all but Akeem Abolanle into their own half, pushing for that lone point off a possible draw. A defensive lapse and a quick decision by Sanjib scotched such hopes, though. A goalmouth bungle saw Hossain Mustafi passing to Sanjib, and the latter chipped home before Isiaka Awoyemi could react to challenge. A neat goal, and a quick sigh of relief for Mohammedan Sporting.

 Caddicks goodbye to ODIs
 CADDICK London: England fast bowler Andrew Caddick retired from international one-day cricket Friday. The 34-year-old Somerset player, who led Englands attack at the World Cup in South Africa, will continue playing Test cricket. He said in a statement that he wanted to give younger bowlers the chance to establish themselves before the next World Cup in 2007. His decision follows Nasser Hussains resignation as Englands ODI skipper. This is a decision that I have been considering for a while and, after talking to (England coach) Duncan Fletcher earlier this week, I feel that now is the time for me to retire from the one-day international arena, Caddick said. Playing for England in the World Cup in South Africa was a high point in my career but I will not be around for the next one and my stepping down will create an opportunity for a younger bowler to cement his place in the one-day side. I still feel that I have plenty to give to the Test side but there is a lot of international cricket to be played this summer and I will need to sit down at the end of the season and review my position before I make any further decisions about my international career. Caddicks absence will leave a big hole in an England attack, which suffered from lack of experience in the World Cup . Caddick, who was born in New Zealand, made his ODI debut against Australia at Old Trafford in 1993. He played 54 ODIs, but only one World Cup, taking 69 wickets at 28.47.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

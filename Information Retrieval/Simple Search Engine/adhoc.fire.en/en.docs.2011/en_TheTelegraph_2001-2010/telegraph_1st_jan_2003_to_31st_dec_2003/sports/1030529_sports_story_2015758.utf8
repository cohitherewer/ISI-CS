 Ex-parte order in Jadejas favour
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: The Delhi High Court Wednesday allowed all-rounder Ajay Jadeja to play in domestic tournaments, if selected. It was a relief for Jadeja, facing a five-year ban from the game following his alleged involvement in match-fixing. We deem it just and appropriate to allow the appellant (Jadeja) to participate in all matches in the domestic circle, if so selected, Delhi High Court Justices B.A. Khan and O.P. Dwivedi said in an ex-parte interim order.  The court issued notices to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to file their reply by July 21, when the case would come up for hearing again. Jadeja, who was not allowed to participate in a local match here after the five-year ban was lifted by the court, is expected to be back on the field soon. Jadeja will start playing league matches from Thursday or latest by Friday, his lawyer Vineet Malhotra said. Jadeja was in Mumbai when the court pronounced the order this afternoon. But, he arrived in the Capital later in the day. The order came on a petition Jadeja had filed against the May 26 order of Delhi High Court Judge Manmohan Sarin, who had refused to entertain Jadejas request that he be allowed to play in domestic circuit while hearing the BCCIs petition. The BCCI had challenged court-appointed arbitrator, Justice JK Mehra order, lifting the five-year ban imposed on him. Justice Sarin is scheduled to hear BCCIs objections to lifting of the ban on July 8.  Jadejas counsel Malhotra had argued that Jadeja would become unfit for any form of cricket if he had to wait for the outcome of the original appeal of BBCIs objections to ban lifting.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kanpur may back out 
New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) may have to shift the first Test against New Zealand in October from Kanpur because of poor ground conditions. The freshly re-laid pitch at Green Park was in bad shape, a 25-metre stretch of the stadium wall collapsed following heavy rain and trucks clearing the debris have damaged the sodden outfield, BCCI joint secretary Jyoti Bajpai said on Thursday. We are not sure whether we will be able to hold the Test, Bajpai, who is also the secretary of the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association, said from Kanpur. The pitch and the outfield are both bad. Bajpai said he has informed the BCCI and was worried Kanpurs international future could be in jeopardy if the International Cricket Council eventually found the conditions were not up to the mark. The Black Caps are due to tour India from September to November to play two Tests and a tri-series also featuring Australia. Kanpur has also been criticised in the past for its poor facilities for the spectators and the media. Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta adds: If the Green Park is actually deemed unfit to host the Test against New Zealand, indications are that the match will be shifted to Ahmedabad. According to The Telegraphs sources, Bangalore would have been a hot choice, but the KSCA stadium has already been awarded a one-dayer during the tri-series. In fact, Bangalore is to host the highly-billed India versus Australia match on November 12. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fleming hopes to beat India
Port Elizabeth: Despite his sides crushing 96-run loss against Australia Tuesday, New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming said his side would be high on confidence when they take on India in their must-win World Cup Super Six match at Centurion Friday. We played very well against India at home earlier this year. Though we lost the match today we had some good aspects. We hope to do well against India, said Fleming after his side failed to win the match despite restricting the defending champions to 208 for nine. Brett Lee took five for 42 while Glenn McGrath claimed three for 29 as New Zealand were bowled out for 112. New Zealand speedster Shane Bond, who claimed six for 23, also agreed with his captain saying they will play according to a plan against the Indians. 			We won the home series 5-2 and that would help us to go in to the match on a confident note. We have some plans in place for the Indians, said the tearaway bowler. (PTI)  Copyright

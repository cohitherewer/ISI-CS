The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 18, 2003  Evangeline sets track on fire 
 BY STAR RACER		 Rabani on Evangeline,  the winner of the Supernova CupCalcutta: Half-money favourite Evangeline blazed the track  that had turned muddy due to the unseasonal rains  when the Bharath Singh-trained filly easily claimed the 1,200m Supernova Cup on Wednesday. In the process, the five-length victory of the Excaliburs Lake-Glowing Tribute daughter gave a fitting answer to her critics who questioned the fillys short odds compared to her potential. Rabani partnered the filly.				 										The 1,600m Army Cup, on the other hand, turned out to be a thriller as it became a tricky proposition for the naked eye to separate Vijay Singhs Anatolia from brother Bharaths Flamebird when they flashed passed the winning post. The two horses had finished on either side of the track after Anatolia had drifted out of a straight couse. However, the camera verdict went in favour of Anatolia, ridden by C. Alford.				 										Final Round, from Darius Byramjis yard, won the General A. S. Vaidya Mem-orial Cup in an impressive manner from two-time winner Reaching Out.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

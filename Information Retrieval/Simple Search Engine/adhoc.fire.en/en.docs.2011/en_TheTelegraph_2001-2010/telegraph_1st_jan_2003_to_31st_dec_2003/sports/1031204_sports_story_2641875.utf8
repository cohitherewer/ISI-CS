The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, December 04, 2003  Vijay, Javed rule the day 
 BY STAR RACER M. Reuben on Toe  Poke C. Alford on Inside  Story (right) about to win the Manasseh Memorial Cup  from Moon Mission (left) and Beneficent at the RCTC  on Wednesday. Pictures by Kishor Roychowdhury  Calcutta: Trainer Vijay  Singh made a cleansweep of the three trophy events in Wednesdays  six-event card, while his fellow-professional, Javed Khan,  notched up a brace of winners on an afternoon ruled by favourites.				 										It was the two-year-old debutant Aperitivo, who fully justified his short-odds in the Dangerous Romance Cup and set the ball rolling for Vijays stable. Adderly, looking slightly gross during the paddock-parade, followed suit at generous odds of 5-4 in the Fame Star Cup, thus putting the trainer and his stable rider C. Alford on a hattrick trail. The duo duly achived the target when their less-fancied Inside Story landed the Manasseh Memorial Cup with a degree of comfort.				 										Javed took over from where Vijay left off. The fluent start-to-finish victory of his even-money favourite Toe Poke was well on the cards and the double followed when the stables Mayan Hiss won her race coming with a late run in the home stretch. M. Reuben partnered the two Javed winers.				 										RESULTS				 										1. Colorado Claro Handicap 1,100m: (6-5-1-2) Castle Moon (A. P.

 Rameez wants action against six sledgers
Islamabad: Rameez Raja, the chief executive officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board Tuesday claimed that at least six fast bowlers around the world should be banned and fined for sledging during international matches. I am not going to reveal their names, Rameez said. However the former Pakistan captain made it clear that if the ICC asks him to identify them, he will. I have already written a letter to the ICC that at least six fast bowlers sledged during international games which is a Level 2 offence as per the ICC Code of Conduct. But no action has been taken against them, Rameez said. Indian Match Referee Gundappa Viswanath fined and banned Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar for two matches for ball tampering during last months triangular series in Sri Lanka. I am not defending Akhtar for his action, but the thing is there should be uniformity in imposing penalties on players, Rameez explained.  (AP)  Copyright

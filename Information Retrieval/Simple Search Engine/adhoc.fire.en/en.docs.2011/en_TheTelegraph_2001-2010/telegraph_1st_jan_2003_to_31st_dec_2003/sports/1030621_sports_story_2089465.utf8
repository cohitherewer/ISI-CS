 ICC guns down proposal
London: The ICC has dismissed as impractical the proposed rolling one-day world championship by the Australian Cricketers Association. It fails to address the multi-dimensional task of understanding the unique and complex programming issues, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said. According to the proposal, a team will travel to ten countries in a year to play one game each. A team will also host ten one-off games against ten opponents while playing ten at a neutral venue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inzy not for many changes
 Inzamam and Javed Miandad Islamabad: Pakistan one-day captain Inzamam-ul Haq has said a number of new players may not be very helpful in building a stronger side and asked the national selectors to be cautious while making too many changes to the team ahead of important series. It was okay to try out five or six new players against Bangladesh in this series but if so many changes are made in future we wont be able to build a strong team, Inzamam said after Pakistan beat Bangladesh in the final one-dayer in Karachi on Sunday. Coach Javed Miandad had a different view. Our job is to play with the squad given to us for a match. But I think the selectors tried out six or seven new players in the series because it was against Bangladesh, he said. Miandad lauded the Bangladesh performance in the Tests and ODIs. It was not easy against them in some of the matches but I think this was also because we had some young players and the quality was missing from our side, he said. Both the captain and coach thanked Bangladesh for orchestrating the return of international cricket to Pakistan, saying the tourists proved players are safe here. We thank Bangladesh for playing in Pakistan and by playing an ODI in Karachi, they proved to the world that cricket is safe here, Miandad said. Pakistan, who swept both the Test (3-0) and ODI (5-0) series, were hosting an international team after a 15-month drought due to security fears. New Zealand had to cut short a tour of Pakistan when a suicide bomb blast outside their team hotel in May last year killed 14 people, including 11 French naval staff. Despite the untroubled tour by Bangladesh, a minor blast in Karachi on Friday prompted South Africa to cancel their tour to Pakistan. (PTI)  Copyright

 - SECOND TEST - Mark Vermeulen hits maiden Test century  Corey Collymore appeals for the wicket of Tatenda Taibu on the third day of the second Test in Bulawayo on Friday. (AFP) Bulawayo: Mark Vermeulen scored his maiden Test century to ease Zimbabwes woes on the third day of the second Test against the West Indies on Friday. The West Indies were 13 for one, a lead of 117, in their second innings when bad light ended play 18 overs early. Wavell Hinds was five not out with Daren Ganga on eight. Vermeulen batted for more than seven hours for his 118, facing 304 balls and hitting 14 fours and a six. Zimbabwe were bowled out for 377 with pacer Corey Collymore the most penetrative of the West Indies bowlers, returning figures of four for 70 in 24 overs. Zimbabwe resumed on 173 for three, and Craig Wishart, 86 not out overnight, looked set for his second Test century when he pulled and cut off spinner Omari Banks for consecutive fours. However, Wishart fell to Collymore in the days third over when a ball pitched on middle stump held its line to trap him leg before. Wisharts dismissal ended a consolidating fourth-wicket stand of 154 with Vermeulen. In his next over Collymore speared through Vermeulens guard with a yorker that bowled him for 61, only for umpire Simon Taufel to rule the delivery a no-ball. But Collymore struck again six overs later with a magnificent ball that swung through the air before seaming away to knock back Stuart Matsikenyeris off stump. That reduced Zimbabwe to 201 for five, but Vermeulens patience and Tatenda Taibus industrious approach prevented further damage until the first ball after lunch, which the young wicketkeeper edged to Chris Gayle at second slip for 27 to end a partnership of 78.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Venus pulls out of meet 
London: Venus Williams has withdrawn from the Advanta Championships tournament in Philadelphia, due to a recurring abdominal strain, officials said on Monday. The American, who has not competed since losing the Wimbledon final to younger sister Serena in July, first suffered the injury in Warsaw at the beginning of May. I regret that I will not be able to compete in the Advanta Championships in Philadelphia, the four-time Grand Slam winner said in a statement. Right now, its important for me to make sure that my body is completely recovered. I am working really hard to get myself back to 100 per cent. The lay-off has been difficult but Im really looking forward to returning to the WTA Tour. Serena has slipped to third in world rankings and Venus to sixth. Serena brought her season to a premature end ten days ago when she said the knee operation she has undergone would prevent her from playing again until next year. I really miss playing tennis and I cant wait to come back and compete, however, I feel that I need more time to prepare and get myself in the best shape possible, the Serene had said. Id like to thank all of the fans who have been so supportive. Unlike Serena, Venus has not yet ruled out playing at the season-ending championships in November. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India make semis with 5-3 win
Hyderabad, Oct. 25 (PTI): India were made to toil as they beat Nigeria 5-3 to book a berth in the semi-finals of the mens hockey at the Afro-Asian games here Saturday. A powerful Nigerian display, coupled with some listless Indian show put India into a tight corner, but it was the experience of the hosts that took them through. Len Aiyappa struck twice while Deepak Thakur, Sandeep Michael and Dilip Tirkey completed the scoreline. For Nigeria, Segun Admisoro scored a brace and Auwolo Lomido the third. The Indian win also assured a berth for Pakistan in the semi-finals from Pool B. Earlier, South Korea beat South Africa 2-0 to ensure a place in the semis from Pool A. India went to the breather with a solid 3-0 lead, but things changed dramatically in the second. After Nigeria pulled one back, Aiyappa struck in the 56th minute to make it 4-1. But Nigeria stunned the packed stadium with two quick goals from Ademisoro and Lomido in the 61st and 67th minutes respectively. With time running out, the Nigerians went all out for the equaliser, but Aiyappa converted a penalty corner in the 69th minute to seal the match. Earlier, Pakistani beat Egypt 3-1 with Rehan Butt (9th), Shakeel Abbasi (38), Ghazanfar ali (43) scoring for the winners. South Korea poured water on South Africas medal hopes beating them 2-0. The second semi-finalist from Pool A will be determined Sunday when South Korea take on Malaysia and South Africa play Ghana. While South Africa are sitting on one point, Malaysia are on four from two matches and need just a draw to qualify for the last four stage. In womens hockey, three first-half goals helped China overcome a spirited Nigeria 3-1 for a place in the semi-finals.  Copyright

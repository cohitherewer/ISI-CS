 5-match ban for Latif
 - Inzamam to lead in ODIs  Inzamam, seen wth Latif, is back at helm after leading in NZ two years ago  Multan: Experienced batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq has replaced  the banned Rashid Latif as Pakistan captain for the five-match  one-day series against Bangladesh starting on Tuesday, the  Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Sunday. Match Referee Mike Procter banned Latif for five one-day Internationals for unfair play during the third and final Test against Bangladesh. Latif claimed a catch off Yasir Ali in the Bangladesh second innings on Friday to dismiss Alok Kapali for 22. Umpires Russell Tiffin and Asoka de Silva ruled the batsman out, but television replays showed Latif had not completed the catch and the ball popped out of his gloves when he fell to the ground. Inzamam, who struck a memorable match-winning unbeaten 138 to help Pakistan squeeze out a one-wicket win in the third and final Test on Saturday, had led Pakistan in New Zealand two years ago. Selectors named the playing XI, recalling opener Imran Nazir and allrounder Abdul Razzaq. Donning the big gloves in Latifs place will be Kamran Akmal.  Surprisingly, experienced batsman Younis Khan was  named one of three reserve players, while Junaid Zia, son  of PCB chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia, was picked ahead of  several other good performers. The 3-0 Test series whitewash notwithstanding, the  PCB slammed the team for almost gifting the third Test to  minnows Bangladesh. The Pakistan team played poorly. I think if club-level  players had played this match, they would have performed  better, Zia was quoted as saying in the media on Sunday.  He observed the performance of the bowlers was satisfactory,  but the efforts put in by the batsmen disappointed him.  THE ODI TEAM Inzamam-ul-Haq (capt.), Imran Nazir, Muhammad Hafeez, Yasir Hameed, Yousuf Youhana, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, Junaid Zia, Umer Gul, Shabbir Ahmed. Reserves: Younis Khan, Danish Kaneria, Salman Butt.  Meanwhile, the South African tour of Pakistan has  come under a cloud as many of the players now touring England  reportedly wanted to return home because of fatigue.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

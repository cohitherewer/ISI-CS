The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sri Lanka, England evenly poised
 Andrew Flintoff after dismissing Upul Chandana in Galle on Wednesday. (Reuters) Galle: Spinner Muttiah Muralidharan shone with bat and ball as Sri Lanka fought back against England on the second day of the first Test on Wednesday. Muralidharan, who had earlier slogged 38 at a run-a-ball at No. 11, dismissed openers Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick in a miserly spell to leave the visitors on 97 for two in reply to Sri Lankas 331. Ashley Giles had taken four for 69 from 32.5 overs for England. Vaughan and Trescothick had started positively, posting a 50-run stand by the 12th over, as the latter pummelled debutant Dinusha Fernando for three boundaries in an over. But Muralidharan, introduced into the attack in the 13th over and who finished with two for 15 off ten overs, needed just 15 balls to take his first wicket of the series. The left-handed Trescothick, perhaps unluckily, was adjudged to have nicked a catch to Kumar Sangakkara behind the stumps. Fours over later, with the light dimming fast after a day of glorious sunshine, Vaughan was bowled between the legs as he tried to pad away a big turning off-break. England had slid from 56 without loss to 67 for two. Mark Butcher, who was dropped on 13 by Mahela Jayawardene at short-leg, survived till the close with fellow left-hander Graham Thorpe.

New Delhi: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has requested the BCCI to settle for a lesser amount as guarantee money for the TVS Cup tri-series played in Dhaka in April. Since top players like Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid did not play in the tournament we are trying to renegotiate the participation fee, BCB president Ali Asghar Lobi said from Dhaka Friday. According to reports, the Indian board was to receive nearly $600,000 as guarantee money from the BCB, but Lobi maintained the amount due to India was $ 200,000.

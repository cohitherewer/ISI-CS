 BCCI to be stern with chuckers
Chennai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to ensure strict measures to stop chucking in domestic cricket. It was decided in the working committee meeting of the BCCI on Thursday that umpires would be specially asked to pay particular attention to the action of bowlers. There is a general perception doing the rounds that many chuckers are coming up these days and the BCCI needs to take proper action, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said. He added that umpires will be asked to pay a lot of emphasis in this regard. The BCCI has also decided to increase the remuneration of umpires from Rs 7,500 to Rs 9,000 per match. It was also decided that the power of the Match Referees for the domestic matches will be increased. A workshop will be held in this regard and some of the problems that were faced in the domestic cricket will be addressed, Dalmiya added. It was also confirmed that the services of renowned Australian psychologist Sandy Gordon will be sought for junior cricketers. Dalmiya informed Gordon would work with the seniors and juniors through the National Cricket Academy, which has been asked to work out the formalities. Dubbing the two-day meeting as a success, the BCCI president added that the recommendations in the secretarys report and various sub-committees will be placed in the Annual General Meeting in Calcutta on September 27-28. He also informed the BCCI has been receiving claims and counter claims on over-aged players being allowed to represent state teams in age-group tournaments. In order to arrest this, we have decided Dr Anant Joshi will examine the players and ensure a uniform method for screening such cases, he said. The BCCI will also have a seminar and examination for the Indian statisticians and scorers. Dalmiya added that the BCCI is not seeking profits and put back 95 per cent of its revenues earned in the 2002-03 season into the game. On the upcoming home series, Dalmiya said: An official from New Zealand and three from Australia visited all the venues and their reports are satisfactory. Green Park in Kanpur has not been allotted any match based on the report of the ground and wickets committee.  (PTI)  Copyright

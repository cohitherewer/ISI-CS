The Telegraph - Calcutta
 6-week ICC deadline for Sanwar 
 Sanwar cleared for now Cairns: Bangladesh spinner Sanwar Hossain was on Tuesday cleared to play against Australia in the three-match one-day series despite being on report for a suspect bowling action. But the 19-year-old runs the risk of being no-balled for chucking. He was reported by Test umpires David Shepherd, Rudi Koertzen and Steve Davis (third umpire) after they reviewed tape of his bowling action taken on the second day of the second Test against Australia. The issue is now under the ICC jurisdiction and over the next six weeks Hossain and the BCB will have the opportunity to work on any areas of concern. Hossain will be able to continue to play during this time, the ICC said in a statement Tuesday. If Hossains action is not remedied in the next six weeks and he is reported again, he could risk a formal hearing and could be banned for 12 months under the ICC guidelines. The first of three one-day matches is scheduled for Cairns on Saturday.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Scotland get Ruud shock
 Ruud van Nistelrooy celebrates with teammates in Amsterdam on Wednesday. (Reuters) London: Ruud van Nistelrooy fired a hattrick as The Netherlands crushed Scotlands dream of a trip to next years Euro 2004 finals with a ruthless reminder of where the two countries really stand in Europes football hierarchy. After a series of surprise first leg results on Saturday, three others of the five favourites  Spain, Russia and Croatia  came through with varying degrees of safety in the second legs. But the biggest shock came in Istanbul where Latvia produced a major upset by knocking out World Cup semi-finalists Turkey to reach the finals of a major tournament for the first time in their short soccer history. Spain put their nerves to one side after an unimpressive 2-1 victory over Norway on Saturday to win 3-0 in Oslo for a 5-1 aggregate success. In Cardiff, Welsh dreams were shattered at the Millennium Stadium as a ruthlessly efficient Russian side booked their place with 1-0 play-off, second leg win. Croatia, also held to a draw on Saturday, beat Slovenia 1-0 away in the second leg to go through 2-1 on aggregate. Latvia fought back from 0-2 down to force a 2-2 draw in the last 24 minutes and win the tie 3-2 on aggregate after their shock 1-0 home win in Riga in the first leg. The Netherlands needed just 14 minutes for Wesley Sneijder to wipe out Scotlands first leg 1-0 advantage and after that they scored with almost embarrassing ease as Nistelrooy grabbed his hattrick and Andre Ooijer and Frank de Boer added the others in the 6-0 whitewash. Meanwhile, holders France, Sweden and the Czech Republic are the top seeds along with hosts Portugal. Big guns Italy, Germany, Spain and England are in a second tier of seeds.  (Agencies)  Copyright

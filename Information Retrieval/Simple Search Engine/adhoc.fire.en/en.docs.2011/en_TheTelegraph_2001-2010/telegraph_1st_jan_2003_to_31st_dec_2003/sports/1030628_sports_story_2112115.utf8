The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Raman no to Bengal offer
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Bengals search for their Ranji Trophy coach continues as Woorkeri Venkat Raman on Friday expressed his inability to take up the job. Raman, who coached Bengal in 2001-2002 season, called up the Cricket Association of Bengal joint secretary Bablu Kolay and informed him that his leave of application was not granted by the office, and therefore, he could not take up the Bengal assignment. It was learnt that the search for an outstation coach is on and among those tipped to be in fray is Robin Singh. Madanlals name cant be ruled out either. Meanwhile, Dattatreya Mukherjee and Udaybhanu Banerjee remained Bengals under-19 coaches while Palash Nandy and Barun Burman kept their coaching job intact at the under-17 level.  Copyright

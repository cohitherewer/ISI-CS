The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Boucher backs Gibbs
Cardiff: South Africas vice-captain Mark Boucher said on Friday that out-of-form opener Herschelle Gibbs was due for a big score. Gibbs has managed just 11 runs in South Africas three one-day tri-series matches  in sharp contrast to his form in October when he became only the third player in history to make three successive ODI hundreds. And Gibbs, twice dismissed for five in his previous two tri-series innings, was run out for one in Thursdays seven-wicket win over England at Old Trafford. But Boucher, speaking at the Sophia Gardens, said: Herschelle was unlucky to be run out. Thats the kind of strange way you can get out when youre out of form. And wicketkeeper Boucher joked of Gibbs. Hersch is too laid back to start worrying. But on a serious note he added: Good players dont get out too often. Hes due a big score. The bowlers werent put under too much pressure against the County sides. But theyve started to find their lengths. That was certainly true of pacer Shaun Pollock, who took a miserly one for 21 from 10 overs against England at Old Trafford on Thursday. (AFP)  Copyright

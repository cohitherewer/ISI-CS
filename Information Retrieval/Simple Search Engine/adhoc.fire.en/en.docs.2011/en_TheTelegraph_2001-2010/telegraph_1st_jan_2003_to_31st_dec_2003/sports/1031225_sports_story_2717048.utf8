 United ask for written clarification
 London: Manchester United have requested for a written clarification for the reasons behind Rio Ferdinands eight-month drugs ban. Ferdinand was officially notified of the punishment, handed down by an independent three-man commission at Bolton last Friday and the press association understands United immediately made their request on his behalf in line with FA regulations. While the decision will prolong the amount of time Ferdinand has to appeal against his suspension, United feel they are justified in asking for further details as the central defender and his legal team ponder their next course of action. Because of an anticipated delay over the Christmas holidays, United do not expect to receive a reply until early next week, probably by fax. It is only when the response is sent that Ferdinands 14-day appeal deadline kicks in. So, should the reply be issued on Monday as anticipated, the 25-year-old will have to decide by January 12  the day his ban is due to start  whether he was going to contest the suspension. Nothing coming out of the United camp in the last few days has suggested there has been any change of heart from the official response to the verdict. Ferdinand has been told by Ferguson that his place in the Old Trafford line-up over the Christmas period is not under threat but as it stands, he would miss the remainder of Uniteds season once he has faced Newcastle on January 11.

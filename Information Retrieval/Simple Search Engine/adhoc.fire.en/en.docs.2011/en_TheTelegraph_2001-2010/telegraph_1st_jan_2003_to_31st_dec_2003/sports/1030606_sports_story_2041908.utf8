The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahesh-Elena in title-round
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Leander Paes (left) and David Rikl were defeated in doubles semi-finals by US Bob and Mike Bryan Thursday Calcutta: It was a day of mixed emotions for Indians at the French Open Thursday. While the Leander Paes-David Rikl pair bowed out from the mens doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi, Paes former partner, and the person who he beat in the mens doubles, moved into the mixed doubles final. Bhupathi and his Russian partner Elena Likhovtseva swept into the final of the mixed doubles, according to information received here. On their way the third seeds beat the top-seeded Australian-Argentine pair of Todd Woodbridge and Paola Suarez 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 in the semi-finals. Paes-Rikl out Paes loss came almost as an anti-climax. After the emotional come-from-behind triumph over Bhupathi, a straight-set defeat in the French Open semi-finals was the last thing Paes fans had been expecting. Fifth seeds Paes and Rikl lost 4-6, 3-6 to No. 3 Bob and Mike Bryan Thursday. The Indian struggled with his serving. He got broken in game 2 to give the Americans a 2-0 advantage. The Indo-Czech pair broke back immediately, capturing Mikes serve. But Paes dropped serve again, in the sixth game, to give the Bryan twins back the initiative. In the second set, it was Rikls turn to slip. The Czech left-hander lost serve in game 6 and the Americans capitalised on that single service-break to seal the match. Paes had tripped at the same stage last year in Paris. Playing with another Czech Tomas Cibulec, he had lost in two close sets to Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor. Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi, too, were eliminated in the semis in 2002, by Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Paul Haarhuis.  Copyright

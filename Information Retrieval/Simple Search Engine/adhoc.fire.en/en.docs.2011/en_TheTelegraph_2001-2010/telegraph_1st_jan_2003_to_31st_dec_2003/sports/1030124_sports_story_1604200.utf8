The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Campaign dedicated to Cronje: Donald
																								Cape Town: South African fast bowler Allan Donald, who will be appearing in his last World Cup next month, has said he would dedicate his performances at crickets premier event to his late former captain Hansie Cronje.																								Donald also wanted the ICC and South Africas United Cricket Board to honour Cronje during the tournament but it was rejected.																								I think I feel the loss more than a lot of the other guys, Donald said of Cronje who was slapped with a life ban after admitting to having received money from bookmakers. 																								Some officials treated him like a murderer and took every chance they could to kick him to death. They did a good job of that, he said on Wednesday.																								But guys who played with him respected him and I think its a great shame there wont be a tribute. 																								Unfortunately some people cant bury the hatchet, even after his death, Donald said.  (PTI)

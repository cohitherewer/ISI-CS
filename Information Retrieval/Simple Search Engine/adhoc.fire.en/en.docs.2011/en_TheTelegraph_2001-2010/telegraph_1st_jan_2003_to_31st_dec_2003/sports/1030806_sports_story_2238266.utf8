 India to face Pakistan on Sept. 24
New Delhi: Having dominated their arch-rivals in recent times, India will again get a chance to play against Pakistan in the Asia Cup whose winner will win a spot in the 2006 World Cup. The India-Pakistan match, always a mouth-watering proposition, will be the second in a space of one month as both are due to play in the Champions Trophy in Amstelveen later this month. India, who have been drawn in pool B of the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in Kuala Lumpur from September 21-28, will take on Pakistan in their last league match on September 24. India, who finished second to South Korea at the Busan Asian Games last year, are the top seeds in the pool which also has Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. South Koreans lead pool B, which also has Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong. The tour opener on September 21 will be played between Pakistan and Bangladesh. Later that day, India will open their campaign in the competition with a match against China. Indias next match, on September 22, will be against Bangladesh. The final would be played on September 28.  (PTI)  Copyright

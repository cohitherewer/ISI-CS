 Jonty: Not the script I envisaged
 Rhodes in Johannesburg Friday Johannesburg: South Africas Jonty Rhodes confirmed his retirement from international cricket on Friday, while leaving himself the tiniest of loopholes to make one last comeback. The 33-year-old, cut from the South Africa squad on Thursday because of a broken hand, said: I always made it my intention that I would retire after the World Cup. This is a bit premature but, unless something else happens to someone else down the line, then yes, this is it. Rhodes was dropped by the selectors after it was revealed his hand would take at least three weeks to heal. It is not quite the script that I envisaged, he said, but added: I actually really see it as a blessing. When I left school in 1988, there wasnt really a hope for me to play. I saw one of the newspaper headlines, it said broken dream, but for me to have played 245 ODIs and participated in four World Cups, theres nothing to be ungrateful for. The ICC confirmed that it was technically possible for Rhodes to be recalled later if another South Africa squad member was ruled out of with injury. I dont think Ive got the patience to be an umpire or the temperament to be a coach, and Im not a commentator. I may talk a lot in the field, but its mostly rubbish, Rhodes added. Maybe Ill take up surfing, its safer out there. (Reuters)  Copyright

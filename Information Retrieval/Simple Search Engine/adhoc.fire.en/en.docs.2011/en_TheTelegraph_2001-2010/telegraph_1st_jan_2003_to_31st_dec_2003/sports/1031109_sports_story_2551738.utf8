 Ponting all praise for skipper Sourav
Guwahati, Nov. 8 (PTI): Australian skipper Ricky Ponting today praised his Indian counterpart Sourav Ganguly saying his return to action would rejuvenate the hosts in their crucial last two games. Ganguly is a very good leader. His return to the field would bring a spring in the steps of the Indians, Ponting told newspersons here on Saturday. He is also a great one-day player who has more than 20 one-day hundreds to his name, Ponting said. Ponting also lauded the Indian team despite the two consecutive defeats, saying, A couple of losses may not have augured well for the side. But they are a very good team.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 Hewitt drawn to meet Kuerten in Round III
				 	 Kuerten: Always a danger																								Melbourne: Lleyton Hewitt must wait a few more days to learn his opening opponent in the Australian Open after the top seed drew a qualifier on Friday.																								But Andre Agassi can begin to mentally prepare for the start of his tilt at a fourth Australian crown. He was drawn against fellow-American Brian Vahaly.																								In the womens draw, Serena Williams opens her Serena slam campaign against Frances Emilie Loit while elder sister and No. 2 seed Venus drew Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia.																								The Williams sisters have contested the last three Grand Slam titles  Serena winning the French, Wimbledon and US Open crowns  but neither has reached the final of the opening Grand Slam of the season.																								Serena missed last years Open with an ankle injury, but her best showing prior to that was a quarter-final finish in 2001. Venus record is marginally better  she reached the semi-finals in 2001. 																								Such was the familys domination last year, though, only the very brave would back against the name Williams ending up on the womens singles trophy this year. 																								Defending champion Jennifer Capriati will have much to say about that, however, as she looks to hold on to the crown she won in 2001 and 2002.																								Capriati, seeded third, opens up  in Venus half of the draw  against German Marlene Weingartner. Serenas half of the draw contains Belgiums Kim Clijsters. 																								No change in dates 																								Any imminent shift of the Australian Open from January to March would be unthinkable, the tournaments chief executive Paul McNamee said on Friday.																								Despite players lobbying for a change in the calendar and their complaints about searing Australian midsummer heat and insufficient warm-up events for the opening Grand Slam of the season, McNamee insisted there would be no change in the calendar until 2007 at the very earliest.																								Lets just say we are going to be in January where we are for the next few years  theres no question about that, he said. (Reuters)

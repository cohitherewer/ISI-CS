The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Laxman eyes revenge vs NZ
 Laxman is optimistic about his ODI future New Delhi: India batsman V.V.S. Laxman, bitterly disappointed at his World Cup omission, plans to redeem himself in the October home series against New Zealand and Australia. The World Cup omission was a big shock, the most depressing moment in my cricket career, Laxman, 28, said from Hyderabad on Friday. It took me some time to recover, but I want to get back into the groove quickly and get big hundreds. The stylish right-hander became an instant celebrity in 2001 after scoring a memorable 281, the highest individual Test score by an Indian. It also set India off to a historic comeback home series victory over Australia. That helped Laxman seal a Test spot, but he was left out of the World Cup side, probably because of poor fielding and the inability to accelerate in the slog overs. Left-hander Dinesh Mongia, chosen ahead of Laxman, failed to impress, although India still reached the final. But Laxman said he was confident he could regain a regular one-day berth. I averaged around 35 last year, and I am very optimistic about my one-day future. He will get his opportunity in both versions when India, after a rare break of nearly six months, play two Tests against New Zealand in October and a one-day tri-series also featuring the world champions. Laxman has aggregated 2687 runs from his 44 Tests at a decent average of just over 41, but has managed a moderate 1250 runs in 51 one-dayers at 27.17. Laxman said India would be out for revenge when they face New Zealand in October. We have to give New Zealand a good beating after we lost there on pitches which were not fit for international cricket, he said, referring to Indias Test and one-day series defeats before the World Cup on under-prepared pitches. He said a strong showing would also be the ideal preparation for the tough tour of Australia from November. A good Test and one-day series will raise our confidence, he said. When we travel to Australia, our confidence should be high, that is important. Laxman said he has fully recovered from a side injury he sustained in March and has also worked on his batting. A natural stroke-player, Laxmans footwork came under scrutiny in New Zealand after he made just 27 runs in four Test innings and 39 from three one-dayers. Everyone struggled in New Zealand, he said. But I have worked on certain things and hope they work in match situations. Laxman said it was sometimes frustrating to bat as low as No. 6 in Tests with only tail-enders for support. One cant consistently score big knocks (at No. 6), I have to admit, said Laxman, who however has no plan to reverse his decision not to open the batting again. Laxman produced his 281 batting at No. 3, but a subsequent poor run enabled Rahul Dravid to regain his favoured batting spot.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

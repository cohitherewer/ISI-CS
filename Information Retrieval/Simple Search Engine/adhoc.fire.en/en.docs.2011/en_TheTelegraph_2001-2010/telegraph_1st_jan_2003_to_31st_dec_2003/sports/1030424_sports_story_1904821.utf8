 Yakubu strike in Churchill victory
Margao: Yusif Yakubus goal helped Churchill Brothers score a solitary goal win over Mahindra United in the penultimate round of the 7th Oil PSU National Football League at the Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday. Five minutes before regulation time, a penalty was awarded after Mahindra keeper Naseem Akhtar got marching orders for bringing down Yakubu inside the box. Mahindra had exhausted their full quota of three substitutes and had no option but to field striker Jose Damasio in the goal. Yakubu, who took the kick himself, made no mistake and beat Damasio to score his 18th goal and consolidate his perch as the highest scorer. With this win, Churchill, with 34 points from 21 matches, have a good chance to finish fourth. They play their last match against lowly ITI. Both teams played hard and matched each other well. Churchill had the initiative for the first 15 minutes and had three scoring chances. Yakubu, who posed a threat to the rival defence whenever he was fed inside the box, came close to scoring twice but Akhtar did well to keep him out. Mahindra put up an improved performance and their defence was well organised. Hakmat Singh, assigned to police Yakubu, did a good job to keep him quiet. Tolly meet JCT Tollygunge Agragami will take on JCT in their penultimate National League match at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday, a Staff Reporter from Calcutta adds. However, JCT will be more keen to win the match considering that they will hope to gain the third spot behind East Bengal and Vasco SC. While JCT are now on 34, four points behind even Salgaocar, Tollygunge have 22 points after 20 matches. The home banks on their striking duo of Ashim Biswas and Akeem. (PTI)  Copyright

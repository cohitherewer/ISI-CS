 Jones, tainted coach part
London: Triple Olympic champion Marion Jones has cut her ties with suspended Canadian sprint coach Charlie Francis, the man behind the biggest scandal in Olympic history. Francis was banned for life from coaching Canadian athletes after Ben Johnson tested positive for steroids following his 100 m victory in world record time at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Jones told the Los Angeles Times she had consulted Francis in order to improve her technique, but acknowledged she had wider responsibilities to her sport. (Reuters)  Copyright

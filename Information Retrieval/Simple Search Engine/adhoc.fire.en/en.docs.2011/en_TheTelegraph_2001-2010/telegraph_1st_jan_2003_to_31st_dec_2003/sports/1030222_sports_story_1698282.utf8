 Errant Errols career cut short 
Johannesburg: Errol Stewart, the South African cricketer who refused to tour Zimbabwe earlier this year, will never again be chosen to play for his country, the UCBSA announced Friday. Stewart declared himself unavailable for the South Africa A tour of Zimbabwe in January, claiming he could not morally play while the country was suffering. A spokesman for the governing body said that Stewart was not being punished for his stance, but because he had not followed the correct procedures. He has still not discussed it with UCBSA chief executive Gerald Majola, the spokesperson said. He did not inform the board of his decision, but went straight to the media. A Natal paper reported that Majola had confirmed the board had made a decision Stewart should not be considered by the national selectors. This is not about Zimbabwe and I dont want to get into that, Majola, when asked about UCBSAs decision would be interpreted as tacit support for President Robert Mugabe. Stewart took the decision upon himself by making himself unavailable without good reason and he never consulted with the UCBSA. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Neutral venue proposed
Amstelveen: The revival of India-Pakistan hockey ties got new thrust on Thursday with officials of both camps proposing a series at a neutral venue next year. We have to break the dead lock and it is necessary that we should play each other, K. Jyothikumaran, secretary of the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), was quoted as saying by a news agency. Jyothikumaran, along with an IHF marketing agent, will hold a meeting with his Pakistani counterpart Brig Musarrat Ullah Khan later this week to discuss the issue. Hopefully we will sort out all the modalities in regard to a hockey series next year at a neutral venue, he said. Meanwhile, Jyothikumaran has indicated a possibility of inducting a foreign coach to reverse the fortunes of the team which was lacking in motivation in the ongoing Champions Trophy. It is a possibility (appointing a foreign coach), but right now, I would not like to say anything on this subject, he said  (PTI)  Copyright

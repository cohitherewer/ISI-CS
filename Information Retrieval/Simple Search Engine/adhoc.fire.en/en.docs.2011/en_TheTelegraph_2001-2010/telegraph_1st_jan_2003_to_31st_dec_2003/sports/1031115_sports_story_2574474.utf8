The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Officials plan talk with Subhas
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Top East Bengal officials are expected to meet coach Subhas Bhowmick on Monday, presumably to discuss why the team has been performing so unimpressively in recent days. The meeting could take place at club president Pranab Dasguptas office. The clubs working committee met at its tent on Friday evening, following a condolence meeting for club accountant Ashoke Roy Gupta who passed away recently. There was no special agenda, but talk did gravitate to the football teams performance. After the meeting Dasgupta said there was only a discussion to fathom the reason for the unimpressive displays of the team. He said there was no meat in the speculation that coach Bhowmicks tenure was in question. For the time  and probably through the National Football League  all Bhowmick-related discussion will be muted. This is probably because, though there has been a difference of opinion among office bearers of the club regarding recent comments made by the coach, it has been mutually understood that there is no point disturbing the applecarts balance. Voiced protests at Fridays meeting were hushed and all the president would say was disappointments would be addressed. The coach could not be contacted for comment.  Copyright

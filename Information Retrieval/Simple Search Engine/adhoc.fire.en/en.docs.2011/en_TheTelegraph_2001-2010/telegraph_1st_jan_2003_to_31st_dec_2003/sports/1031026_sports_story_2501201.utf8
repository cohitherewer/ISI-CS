		 Sunday, October 26, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Faisalabad: Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has been asked by the Afghanistan Cricket Federation to coach their junior team in the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Trophy early next year in India.				 																																	Latif, who pulled out of the Test series against South Africa after stepping down as captain, said on Saturday: They want me to act as their coach in the tournament. 				 																																	But I have yet to take any decision as I am going to make myself available for Pakistans tour to New Zealand in December.				 																																	Lloret de Mar (Spain): Former Formula One driver Jean Alesi has been reduced to walking pace after having his drivers licence taken away when caught for speeding. 				 																																	Alesi, who retired from the Grand Prix circuit in 2001, was clocked in his Mercedes AMG at 191 kmph by French police driving his mother from Geneva to Avignon last weekend. It was nine Oclock in the morning  my mother had to take over the wheel, the ex Ferrari driver told AFP Saturday. 				 																																	The Frenchman had a five-year spell with Ferrari and it was with the Italian team that he registered his only GP win in Montreal in 1995. 				 																																	Buenos Aires: Julio Humberto Grondona has been unanimously reelected as president of Argentinas Football Federation for the seventh consecutive time. 				 																																	The 72-year-old who is also vice-president of Fifa first took up office in 1979 with the high point of his time in power coming in 1986 when Argentina won the World Cup in Mexico. His latest mandate runs out in October 2007. 				 																																	Basel: Roger Federer says he could be forced to pull out of next weeks Paris Masters because of a back injury.				 																																	Switzerlands Federer suffered the injury on Thursday before his second round defeat to Croatias Ivan Ljubicic in the Swiss Indoors in his home town Basel. The Wimbledon champion had treatment on his back on Friday and will continue with specialist advice on Saturday in a bid to be fit for the Paris meet, which starts on Monday. My spine was totally blocked yesterday, Federer said. 				 																																	London: Glenn Hoddle, sacked as Tottenham Hotspurs manager last month, says the Londoners should give the job to caretaker David Pleat because no one else could work with the man employed by the club as director of football. He (Pleat) was so obstructive towards me, never working in harmony with me and always working towards his own end, Hoddle said on Saturday. To get the success the fans crave, there is only one solution, give David the job because the position he holds (director of football) is making it difficult for a manager to succeed. Hoddle was appointed manager in April 2001 but lost his job in a 30-second phone call from Spurs chairman Daniel Levy on September 21. Seoul: A top South Korean sports official  has proposed that the two Koreas form a single team for  the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, reports said Saturday.  The offer came from (South) Korean Olympic Council chairman  Lee YunTaek at talks Friday with North Korean officials  on the sidelines of an inter Korean sports festival, Yonhap  news agency said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Steve stands by Warne
Sydney: Australian Test skipper Steve Waugh threw his weight behind Shane Warne and urged fans not to make their judgement without knowing the full facts. While extending his support to Warne and his family, Steve claimed that enemies in the media were trying to wreck the champion leg-spinner. I am part of the cricket side and we have some loyalty to each other... I feel for Shane and whats happened, said Steve. The skippers backing comes amid reports that the teammates of Warne, accused of making lewd calls to a South African woman, were fed up with his off-field indiscretions. Hes human, he makes mistakes and I think he pays for them pretty heavily. I certainly support Shane and his family, the captain was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday. Its a tough time, a lot of people are sort of kicking the boot in right now and a lot of his enemies in the media are having a crack at him. Steve said the latest controversy was a personal issue for Warne and his family to deal with and he should not be judged until he gives his side of the story. The skipper also said instead of prying into ones private life, the media should concentrate on more major issues. Youve got to give the guy a fair chance and let him have his say and when he does that, respect what he says and then make a judgement. But a lot of people have made their judgement before knowing the facts, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

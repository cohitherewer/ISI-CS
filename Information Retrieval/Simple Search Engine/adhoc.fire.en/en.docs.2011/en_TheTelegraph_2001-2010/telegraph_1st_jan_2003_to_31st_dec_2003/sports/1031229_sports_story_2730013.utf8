		 Monday, December 29, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Melbourne: Frances former Davis Cup hero Nicolas Escude and 15-year-old Tatiana Golovin have been given wildcard entries to next years Australian Open, the tournament announced on Sunday.				 																																	The Australian Open, from January 19 to February 1, holds a reciprocal wildcard agreement with the French Open and the two national federations.				 																																	Escude, 27, the hero of Frances 2001 Davis Cup final win over Australia at Melbourne Park, watched his ranking slip from 34 to 114 during an injury-interrupted 2003. Boasting a junior ranking as high as world No. 6 in September this year, Golovin was a semi-finalist at the US Open juniors in 2002, and in 2003 reached the last eight at both Flushing Meadows and Junior Wimbledon, the Australian Open said in a statement. 				 																																	The talented Frenchwoman has played one senior Grand Slam tournament, losing in the first round at this years French Open, the Australian Open statement said.				 																																	London: One positive to come out of the Rio Ferdinand drugs case was that no player would miss taking a dope test again, Football Association (FA) chief executive Mark Palios said on Sunday.				 																																	After this case, I dont think any club will allow a player to miss a drugs test again, Palios told the News of the World newspaper in an interview.				 																																	England international Ferdinand was given an eight-month ban by an independent disciplinary commission earlier this month for missing a drugs test.				 																																	The Manchester United defender had been charged by the Football Association with a failure or refusal to take the test at Uniteds training ground at Carrington on September 23.				 																																	I didnt feel pleased or vindicated (about the decision). I actually felt quite sad because I know, up until now, football has been the loser, Palios said. 				 																																	But if there has been a positive in what has been a difficult year it is that we are at last on the right road.				 																																	London: Englands World Cup winning centre Mike Tindall is not suffering from a broken leg, as was first suspected. Tindall suffered the injury while playing for his club Bath on Saturday.				 																																	Tindall was carried off the field on a stretcher after landing awkwardly while scoring Bats first try in the 10th minute of their Premiership game against Saracens. Tindall underwent a further scan after X-rays showed he did not break his leg. There was no break although the scan did show he had an unstable ankle, a Bath spokesman said.				 																																	The reaction of the players around Mike was that he had broken his leg, said head coach John Connolly.However, it appears that it is an ankle injury and whilst we fear the worst we hope for the best.				 																																	Sydney: Australian super maxi Skandia maintained its narrow lead over New Zealand rival Zana in the Sydney-Hobart race on Sunday as the leading boats neared the finish line after a rough crossing of Bass Strait. High seas forced the retirement of 2000 winner Nicorette of Sweden earlier on Sunday and also caused anxious moments for crews on the two leading boats, which have been engaged in a tense tactical battle throughout the 630 nautical mile race. Skandia and Zana, two 30 metre (98 feet) carbon  fibre boats, have been within sight of each other since  Fridays start in Sydney Harbour and were expected to finish  on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak stars plea
Islamabad: Heroes of Pakistans inaugural cricket tour of India more than 50 years ago have called for the resumption of regular matches to help ease tensions between the two neighbours. Political differences have plagued fixtures since the two cricket-mad countries first faced each other in 1952-1953 following partition in 1947. But surviving members of Pakistans 18-man touring squad, who were honoured for their efforts by Pakistans President this week, said they wanted to see regular series resume. (AFP)  Copyright

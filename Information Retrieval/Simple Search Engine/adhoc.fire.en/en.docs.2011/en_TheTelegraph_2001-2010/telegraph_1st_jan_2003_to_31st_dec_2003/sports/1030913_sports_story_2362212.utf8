The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Youhana steals the show
 - Second ODI - Salehs allround effort fails to lift Bangladesh  Junaid Zia castles Khaled Mashud in the Faisalabad one-day International on Friday. (AFP) Faisalabad: Yousuf Youhanas gritty century (105) inspired Pakistan to a 74-run win over Bangladesh in their second one-day International here on Friday. Pakistan, who won the first game by 137 runs, were restricted to 243 for eight in 50 overs in the second game of the five-match series. Bangladesh, in reply, were dismissed for 169 in 42.1 overs at the Iqbal Stadium. My idea was to stay at the wicket till the 50th over because we lost three quick wickets in the middle of the innings, Youhana said. In the end I scored a century and we posted good enough runs for our bowlers to defend. Rajin Saleh (64) and Habibul Bashar (25) gave Bangladesh an opportunity to level the series when they put on 82 runs for the second wicket off 105 balls. Bashar survived a potential first ball dismissal when wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal missed a chest-high catch off Umer Gul. Experienced allrounder Abdul Razzaq broke the threatening partnership when he trapped Bashar leg before and then uprooted Tushar Imrans middle-stump as Bangladesh lost two wickets in the space of three runs to slump to 90 for three. Saleh completed his half-century for Bangladesh off 65 balls with eight boundaries before Shoaib Malik struck twice and swung the match Pakistans way. Saleh chipped a ball straight to Gul at long-on before Mashrafe bin Murtaza gave an easy catch to Youhana at deep mid-wicket. Junaid Zia was thrashed for 16 runs in his first spell of two overs but came back well to wrap up the innings with three for 21. Earlier, part-time off-spinner Saleh picked up three wickets for 48 while left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique claimed two wickets for 45, as both bowlers prevented the Pakistani batsmen from scoring freely. Youhana raised his ninth century in one-day Internationals in the 49th over off 124 balls, hitting seven fours. He lost his wicket in the last over of the innings when he attempted to hit a successive six off Murtaza and was caught in the deep. Pakistans middle-order batsmen couldnt take advantage of a fine 87-run stand between Youhana and Inzamam-ul-Haq. From a somewhat comfortable 141 for three in the 30th over, Pakistan cheaply lost three hard-hitting batsmen by the 40th over. Younis Khan and Malik fell to Saleh, and Razzaq was caught behind by wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud as Pakistan slipped to 177 for six. Kamran Akmal (26) and Youhana added 53 for the seventh wicket before Akmal holed out at deep mid-wicket to give Saleh his third scalp. After Pakistan elected to bat first, Mohammed Hafeez and Yasir Hameed combined in a 45-run opening stand in 10 overs, but both departed in medium fast bowler Rehmans first over. Hameed, a century-maker in Pakistans 137-run win in the first ODI in Multan on Tuesday, made 15 and was bowled while Hafeez (26) edged Mashud. Inzamam looked in supreme form in scoring 41 off 46 balls. However, Rafique foxed him with a flighted delivery, which castled the Pakistan captain.  (AP)  Copyright

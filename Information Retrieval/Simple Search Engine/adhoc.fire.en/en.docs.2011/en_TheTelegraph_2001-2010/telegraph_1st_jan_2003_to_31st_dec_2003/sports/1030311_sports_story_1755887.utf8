 Inzamam quits vice-captaincy
 Inzamam-ul Haq and Waqar Younis during a press conference in Lahore Monday. (AP/PTI) Islamabad: Beleaguered Pakistan skipper Waqar Younis Monday declined to take full blame for the teams World Cup debacle and refused to step down, saying it would be unjustified if only his captaincy was blamed for the flop show. But vice-captain Inzamam-ul Haq chose to quit his post, saying, it was time a youngster is given the job so that he learns the art of leading the team before he is handed over the big job. The players, flanked by team manager Shahryar Khan, announced their decision at a press conference in Lahore. The desperation to stave off public wrath was evident as the cricketers, once again, apologised for their poor performance. Waqar said the entire team failed to rise to the occasion at the World Cup. It would be unjustified if only the captaincy is blamed. I think we didnt bat and bowl as well as we should have. Overall, the teams performance was below-par and we have no excuses to offer, Waqar said. We have let the nation down but now we have to repair the damage, he said. Waqar said it was now up to the selectors and cricket administrators to decide whether they wanted to retain him as the skipper. Its entirely on them but I think my performance over the last couple of year has been good if not excellent. I have finished second best (in terms of wickets) if not the leading wicket-taker, he said. Woefully out-of-form Inzamam said he had let the country down with his lacklustre performance. I feel I have to shoulder some of the responsibility and consequently have decided to step down as vice-captain. Now my objective is to concentrate on my batting and regain confidence for future assignment, Inzamam said. (PTI)  Copyright

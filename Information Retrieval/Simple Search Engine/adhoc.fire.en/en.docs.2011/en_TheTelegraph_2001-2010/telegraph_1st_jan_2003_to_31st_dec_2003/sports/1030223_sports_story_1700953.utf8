		 Sunday, February 23, 2003  Zurbaran fancied 
 BY TITAN BOY				 										indian turf invitation cup				 										The Mumbai-brigade may call the shots at the Hyderabad Sunday in the 2,400m Indian Turf Invitation Cup. The equation has hardly chanced and those who made it to the paying slots in the Indian Derby, and, of course, the failed-favourite Classical Act, will all be there at the busy-end for their supreme test of class, said S. Padmanabhan whos ward Zurbaran was surprised, in the Derby, by Vinayaks Noble Eagle, now back to his original trainer M. Jadhav. The Mumbai contingent has travelled well and Calssical Acts good looks pose warning of ignore-me-not-kind, added the trainer. 				 										Michael Eshwer, on the other hand, is on the roll. Dont count me out, Pal, said the Saturdays Sprinters and the Stayers winner. The luck factor apart, my Gisele is also the conqueror of Twin Star who placed in the Mumbai Derby. More importantly, she has improved and she is Trustworthy, too.				 										In fact, most of trainers think, this years Invitation Cup is a very open one. Noble Eagle, Zurbaran, Gisele, Fabulous Star, Amber Regent and Twin Star, anyone can win. But considering their present preparations and past performances, Zurbaran (with M. Dwyer in the saddle), Amber Regent and Classical Act are expected occupy the top three slots  not necessarily in the order named.				 										SELECTIONS				 										1.15 pm: Indian Native 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kartik likely to cause upset
 - On and off the field, its a big day for Indian cricket  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: For the first time in years, the dramatis personae have all but gone silent (even off the record) on the eve of picking Team India for a major series  in the present context, the four Tests in Australia between December 4 and January 6. The reason, perhaps, is understandable: There appears to be a question mark over the countrys most successful spinner, leggie Anil Kumble. While three slower bowlers have been named in the 20  others being Harbhajan Singh and Murali Kartik  only two will take next Fridays Chennai-Kuala Lumpur flight en route to Australia. The 20 will be pruned to 16 on Saturday evening, in any case already labelled a big day for Indian cricket. Of course, thanks to 358 wickets in 78 Tests, Kumble may still make it, but he is under pressure from left-armer Kartik. In fact, late on Friday, a well-placed source of The Telegraph indicated even Harbhajan (despite a record 32 wickets in the last series versus Australia) isnt guaranteed a place. Clearly, it seems not just the selectors, but captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright arent sure whether experience alone should get weightage or form be accorded its due. That Kartik keeps making the most of whatever opportunities come his way, is a distinct plus. Indeed, the semi-final in Hyderabad could earn or deny Kartik a seat on that flight from Chennai. Unless theres a rethink, the left-armer and offie Harbhajan are the two spinners set to be fielded against New Zealand. As suggested, Harbhajan is also on trial, difficult though that is to digest. Keeping fingers crossed, no doubt, is going to be Kumble. He did make the 1999-2000 tour of Australia, but was ignored on the 1991-92 visit. Incidentally, the recent success of Zimbabwean Raymond Price  he picked up six wickets in the first innings at the SCG  and Ashley Giles six-wicket haul at the Gabba, last season, hasnt gone unnoticed... The other troublesome spot, so to say, is in the batting department. The left-handed Sadagopan Ramesh is favoured to feature in the 16, but Yuvraj Singh (another left-hander) does have backers. Assuming theres no manipulation of the extraordinary kind overnight, 13 are certain to make the squad: Sourav, vice-captain Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Akash Chopra, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S.Laxman, Parthiv Patel, Deep Dasgupta, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Ajit Agarkar, Avishkar Salvi and Lakshmipathy Balaji. Almost there is Ramesh and the line-up will be completed by two spinners  in all probability, Harbhajan will be one of them. Out of contention, at this point in time, are Hemang Badani and Irfan Pathan.  Copyright

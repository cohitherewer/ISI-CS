 Barcelona will help me reach full potential 
 Ronaldinho feels he must grow as a player Paris: Brazilian midfielder Ronaldinho believes his new club Barcelona will help him to reach his full potential. Im not at one hundred per cent of my potential yet, the 23-year-old playmaker told soccer magazine France Football. What matters is that I continue to grow and surrounded as I am by great players, at Barca or with Brazil, I can be full of hope, he said. Ronaldinhos decision to join Barca in July from Paris St Germain after being approached by Real Madrid and Manchester United had come as a surprise, especially as the Catalan club are not playing in the Champions League this season. It was beautiful. The struggle between such great clubs was an extra motivation to work even harder to reach my best, he said. The gifted Brazilian said he had signed for Barcelona because it was a good offer and PSG agreed. I must grow as a player. Im still very far from Maradona, Romario, Stoichkov, Zidane, Gullit, Van Basten, Rijkaard, Rivaldo or Ronaldo. Theyre the best. My goal is just to work hard and one day get near them, he said. Ronaldinho added that Barca should not feel inferior to champions Real Madrid. I trust Barcelona have the means to challenge them, he said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

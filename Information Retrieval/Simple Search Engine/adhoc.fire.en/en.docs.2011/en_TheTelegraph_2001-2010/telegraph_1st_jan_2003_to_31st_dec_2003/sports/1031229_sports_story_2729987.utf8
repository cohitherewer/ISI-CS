 Kallis, Kirsten in record stand 
 Jacques Kallis on way to 177 in Durban on Sunday Durban: Jacques Kallis and Gary Kirsten guided South Africa to a record total that put them in control of the second Test against the West Indies on Sunday. At stumps on the third day, the West Indies were 18 without loss in their second innings, a deficit of 376. Wavell Hinds was batting on seven with Daren Ganga on four. The West Indies scored 264 in their first innings, but South Africa replied with 658 for nine declared, their highest total on home soil. The score was amassed with the help of a record fourth-wicket stand of 249 between Kallis, who made 177, and Kirsten, who hit 137. The West Indies compounded their misery by dropping six catches during the South African innings. However, the stand of Kallis and Kirsten hogged the limelight on Day III. Kallis 177  his 13th Test century, which lasted eight hours  came off 344 balls and included 20 fours. Kirstens 137 was his 20th century, and he batted for four and half-an-hours, faced 218 deliveries and hit 20 fours. It was the ninth century partnership Kallis and Kirsten have shared in Test matches, also a South African record. South Africa, who resumed on 303 for three, might have lost their fourth wicket in the fifth over of the days play when Kirsten, on 22, edged a delivery from fast bowler Merv Dillon through Brian Lara at first slip.

 Becks Argentine duel continues
 Beckham argues with Duscher (right) and Scaloni in Madrid on Sunday. (AP) Madrid: Deportivos Argentine winger Lionel Scaloni accused David Beckham of making an obscene gesture at him towards the end of Real Madrids 2-1 win over the visitors on Sunday. The England captain and Scaloni tangled in the dying seconds of the match with Beckham appearing to kick his opponents heels from the rear. Both men ended up on the ground and Scaloni tried to hit and stamp on Beckham while being restrained by Reals Roberto Carlos. After that Beckham offered to shake my hand but I refused because it was a false gesture, the former Argentine under-20 international said. At that moment, when he was walking away, he touched his genitals, added Scaloni, using more diplomatic language than he had appeared to use on the pitch. Scaloni then appeared to confront Beckham after the whistle. There was pushing and shoving before they were ushered into the dressing rooms. It was because of this (gesture) that I went after him after the end of the game, explained Scaloni. Deportivo midfielder Aldo Duscher also jumped into the fray to lay his hands on Beckham after the game. The appearence of Duscher in the melee added, if not a chapter then at least a footnote to his controversial history with Beckham. A wild tackle from Duscher infamously broke a bone in Beckhams left foot in the Champions League quarter finals two seasons ago, when the England captain was a Manchester United player. For his part, Beckham shrugged off the incident.  (AFP)  Copyright

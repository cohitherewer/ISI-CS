The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India, Windies should do well in 2007: Sourav
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  SOURAV: All praise for youngsters Calcutta: It was a huge heartbreak on March 23 at the Wanderers, but Indian captain Sourav Ganguly feels that the share of positives surpass the disappointment by a long way. And the biggest plus has been the rise of a number of young players who can do it for India in the future. There were at least 10 players who were new to the big stage, but the way they performed really augurs well for the country, Sourav said in his speech during the felicitation organised by the state government at the Netaji Indoor Stadium Friday. Sourav felt that India and West Indies were the teams to look out for in the 2007 World Cup. West Indies, like India, have a bunch of talented players and they too should do well in the next edition of the Cup, Sourav added. He also thanked coach John Wright, and the support team of Andrew Leipus and Adrian Le Roux for their immense contribution to the team.  Copyright

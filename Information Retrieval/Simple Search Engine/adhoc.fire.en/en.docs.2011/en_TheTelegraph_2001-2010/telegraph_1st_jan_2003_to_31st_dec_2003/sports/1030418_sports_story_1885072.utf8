The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cries to allow Warne for charity
Sydney: The father of conjoined twins Thursday pleaded with the Australian Cricket Board to reverse its decision to ban leg-spinner Shane Warne from playing in charity matches. Australias highest Test wicket-taker was banned from cricket till February 10 next year after testing positive for a banned diuretic. The 12-month ban prevents Warne from taking part in a scheduled match to raise money for Brisbanes Royal Childrens hospital through a charity set up by the Nolan family. Shaun Nolan, the father of conjoined Brisbane twins Alyssa and Bethany Nolan, said the decision was a major blow to Beths Legacy Foundation, which raises money for families with children in hospital. Alyssa and Bethany were born joined at the head on May 3, 2001. While Alyssa survived, Bethany died during an emergency operation to separate her from her sister a few weeks after they were born. Warne and wife Simone are patrons of Beths Legacy Foundation and Warne would have been a major drawcard at the charity match. But ACB directors decided at the weekend Warne could not take part in any cricket match, including charity and testimonial games, during his 12-month ban. Asked what he would say to the ACB, Nolan said: I would say, why not let Warnie get involved in this match and do some real good? Okay, hes copped a ban, let him do some real good for the community and someone... Benefit from that and please change their mind. Nolan said the foundation had hoped to raise about $ 30,000 from the match involving Warne and described the ban as harsh. Theres no personal gain in it for Shane, he said. Warne will have to wait until after Easter to learn whether he can play in English charity matches.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Kahn doesnt rule out leaving Bayern
- We wont let him go, says Rummenigge Berlin: Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn repeated Friday that he was considering leaving the German champions even though the clubs chairman said he was not for sale.There are things that you must consider, Kahn told a news conference in Munich held amid media speculation that he might move abroad.A player always comes to a point where he realises that he has achieved a lot with a club and considers how he can still improve, added the 33-year-old, who had earlier said he was looking forward to a new challenge.The Bayern and Germany skipper, who has been linked to several top clubs, was speaking after Germanys top-selling daily Bild reported Friday that he had received an offer from English Premier League champions Manchester United.There is nothing concrete, Kahn said when asked whether he had been contacted by Manchester United. The decisive factor for me is the level of performance which I can reach. To consider several options is only normal.Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge was quoted as saying Friday that Kahn had a contract for another three years and would not be released by the club.He has a contract until 2006, Rummenigge said. Even if we had 15 offers for him, we would not let him go.Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld said in March he was worried his captain might leave if he continued to face pressure from the media over his personal life.Kahn made headlines in Germany for weeks after admitting he had betrayed his pregnant wife by having an affair with a barmaid.Bayern officials have said they wanted Kahn, who has been at Bayern since 1994, to end his playing career at the club before moving upstairs, possibly as commercial manager.

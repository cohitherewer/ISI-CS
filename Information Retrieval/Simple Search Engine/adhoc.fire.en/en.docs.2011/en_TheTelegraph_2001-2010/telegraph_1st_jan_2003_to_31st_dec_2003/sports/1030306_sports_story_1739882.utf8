The Telegraph - Calcutta
 There may be more like Warne
Sydney: Australias banned leg-spinner Shane Warne might not be the only cricketer to have taken drugs and other top notch players too could be committing a similar offence, according to a senior anti-doping official. Warnes recourse to banned diuretics to speed up his recovery from shoulder injury before the World Cup indicated that several others playing non-stop cricket could be under dope, according to Shoaib Manjra, chief of the ICCs anti-doping agency. I think there is doping in cricket. We cant say its not a problem in the game, Manjra was quoted as saying by The Herald on the sidelines of a three-day conference in Copenhagen where the international sports federations are trying to thrash out a global anti-doping policy. The WADA had come down heavily on the Australian Cricket Board for not imposing a two-year ban on Warne that is mandatory for testing positive for diuretics under its policy. Manjra said Warnes case highlighted a common problem.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

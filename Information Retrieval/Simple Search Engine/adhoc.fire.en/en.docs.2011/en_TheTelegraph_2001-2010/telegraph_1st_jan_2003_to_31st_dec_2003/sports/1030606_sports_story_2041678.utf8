 ACA proposes new ODI format
Melbourne: Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief executive Tim May has called for the current schedule of one-day matches to be scrapped and replaced by a league. The ACA model would mean one nation would be crowned the champion each year. It would feature 11 teams, playing each other three times, and a relegation system. May, a former Australia bowler, launched the model on Thursday in a bid to increase revenue, attendances, development opportunities for emerging cricket nations and lessen any temptation for corruption. The ACA agrees with (outgoing ICC president Malcolm Gray) that the game is being damaged by an unprecedented number of one-sided matches across the globe, May said in a statement. The essence of any sporting competition in the eyes of the ultimate stakeholder (the spectator) is not knowing who is going to win. Cricket authorities have identified that ... cricket is potentially damaged by the over-scheduling of uneven matches, yet they continue to put more of it out there for us to consume. Every set of three matches against another country would comprise a home, away and neutral venue game. Each country would host 15 games for the year, that is, 10 home and five neutral games, May said. One-day cricket as we know it would be totally scrapped, that is, this 30-round competition would replace all other ODI games. (Reuters)  Copyright

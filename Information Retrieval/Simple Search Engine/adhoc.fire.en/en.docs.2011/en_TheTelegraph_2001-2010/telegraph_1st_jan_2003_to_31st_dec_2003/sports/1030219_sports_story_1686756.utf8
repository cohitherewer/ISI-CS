 Fletcher wants Hussain to stay
Port Elizabeth: England coach Duncan Fletcher will try to convince Nasser Hussain to stay on as captain after the World Cup. Hussain threatened Saturday to stand down at the end of the tournament after becoming disillusioned with the sports ruling bodies over their handling of the Zimbabwe controversy. He has done a good job and I would like him to continue captaining England over the next summer, Fletcher said Tuesday. I dont want to talk about the issue during the World Cup and it is something that should be sorted out when the tournament has finished. We are in the middle of a World Cup campaign and I want everybody focussed on that. Fletcher and Hussain have built a successful partnership since their first tour together to South Africa in 1999-2000. Englands World Cup campaign does not begin in earnest until Saturday when they meet Pakistan in Cape Town after matches against minnows Namibia and Holland. (Reuters)  Copyright

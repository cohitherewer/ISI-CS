The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hauritz for Warne
  Melbourne: Young off-break bowler Nathan Hauritz will replace suspended leg spinner Shane Warne in Australias 15-man squad at the World Cup, the ACB announced on Monday.Hauritz will join the Australia squad on Tuesday at their base in Potchefstroom upon their return to South Africa from Bulawayo, the ACB said in a statement. The 21-year-old Queenslander has taken seven wickets in five ODIs after making his debut against South Africa in Johannesburg 11 months ago. Its obviously a strange feeling, because I am disappointed at the result of Shanes hearing, but naturally thrilled to be called up into the squad, Hauritz said in an ACB statement. Shane has been one of my heroes since I was a kid, so to be replacing him now is somewhat bitter-sweet.Meanwhile, Warne said on Monday he was reconsidering his planned appeal against the 12-month doping ban. The appeal situation is something that I have to think about, Warne, who flew home from the World Cup without playing a match, wrote in Melbourne newspaper the Herald Sun.Do I want to go through all this again and put my mum, wife, kids and the rest of the family through another couple of weeks of heartache, anticipation and anxiety? This is something I am giving a lot of thought to because I have seven days to decide. I have a lot of angry and disappointing thoughts at the moment but I do have to start thinking clearly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Milestone beckons Lara
 - SECOND TEST vs SA - Injury scare for Windies skipper;  Gayle, Collymore sidelined
 Gary Kirsten return almost certain Durban: Brian Lara and Gary Kirsten will have individual milestones in mind when the second Test between South Africa and West Indies starts on Friday. Lara will become the sixth West Indian to play 100 Tests, while Kirsten, already South Africas most capped player, will play his 96th Test. Kirsten has said he aims to play at least 100 Tests and score 20 centuries. He has 19 Test hundreds to his name. Stalwart batsman Kirsten is likely to return to the team after missing the first Test in Johannesburg, which South Africa won by 189 runs, to be with his wife for the birth of their first child. I feel sorry for the guys leaving the side, but you cant leave a guy like Gary out, South Africa wicketkeeper and vice-captain Mark Boucher said. Its difficult to change a side after a win like we had at the Wanderers, but someones got to make way for a great player like Gary. I spoke to him the other night, and hes dead keen to get back. I know he wants to play a hundred Tests for his country and score 20 centuries. Lara was injured in training on Wednesday as batsman Chris Gayle and fast bowler Corey Collymore were ruled out of the second Test. Lara was hit on the left forearm while batting during team practice at Kingsmead. Although a precautionary X-ray showed bruising, there was no serious damage. Opening batsman Gayle and Collymore were sidelined with hamstring injuries sustained in earlier matches. Lara went for a precautionary X-ray, which just showed bruising, West Indies coach Gus Logie told reporters. Its Brians 100th Test match, and we want to make it as special as we can  both for him and for the team. The absence of Gayle could open the door for Carlton Baugh, the understudy wicketkeeper to Ridley Jacobs who can play as a specialist batsman. Fast bowler Adam Sanford, who took five for 53 in the drawn tour match against Border in East London at the weekend, and uncapped left-arm wrist spinner Dave Mahommed are in the frame to replace Collymore. Vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan was relieved that key batsman Lara had been cleared to play in the match. It would be a privilege and an honour to captain the West Indies, but Brians fit to go and Im happy with that, said Sarwan. For South Africa, left-arm wrist spinner Paul Adams was recalled to the squad, in place of left-arm finger spinner Robin Peterson. But two days of rain in Durban this week could affect the XI the home side selects for the match. With the conditions as they are, Im not sure if Kingsmead needs a spinner, Boucher said.But thats up to the selectors and the captain, and no-one has seen the wicket yet. Durban traditionally favours seam and swing bowlers early in a match before offering batsmen a sound platform on which to perform. Boucher said South Africa were satisfied with their performance in Johannesburg and did not need to make a lot of changes to their approach. The exception in the first Test was the last session on the third day when the West Indies scored 124 runs and Lara took a world record 28 runs off a single over from Peterson on his way to a score of 202. Boucher said: As we all saw, Lara is the type of guy who can kill you in one session. Were very aware of that, and we dont want to let a session like that slip away from us because they have dangerous players.

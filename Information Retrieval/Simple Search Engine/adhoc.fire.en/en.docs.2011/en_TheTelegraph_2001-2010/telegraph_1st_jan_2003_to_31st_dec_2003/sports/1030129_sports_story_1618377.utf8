		 Wednesday, January 29, 2003 				 EB aim for big win
																								Bangalore: East Bengal will look to extend their winning run when they take on ITI in a National League matchhere. In their previous match against HAL, the red-and-gold brigade emerged a convincing 5-3 winner. Though the attack looks quite potent, the defence still seems to be a bit of the worry for coach Subhas Bhowmick.																								His defensive woes were increased by the absence of Dipak Mondal, who is still nursing an injury. But the form of Mike Okoro, the Nigerian striker, has been a huge boost for the Calcutta giants. Also the presence of Alvito DCunha in prime form has given East Bengals attack an air of invincibility.																								East Bengal are at the top with 22 points from nine games while ITI are languishing at the bottom with three.

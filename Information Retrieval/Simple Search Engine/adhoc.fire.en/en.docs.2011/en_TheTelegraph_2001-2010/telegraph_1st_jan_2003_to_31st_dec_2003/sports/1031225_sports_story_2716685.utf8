The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stakes high on Xmas day
 - Pakistan players eat out, watch movie on India match-eve  BY ATREYO MUKHOPADHYAY  Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh during a practice session at Eden Gardens on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The two teams share lots in common, have had an identical run in the Kenstar Asian A Championship so far and go into Thursdays crunch match hoping its Merry Xmas for just one. Its India versus Pakistan at Eden Gardens and according to many, it doesnt get bigger than this, what if just the A teams are fighting it out. Mind it, defeat again will dent chances of either team making it to the final, with Sri Lanka A enjoying a Santa Claus run under Russel Arnold. Now, an India versus Pakistan match has always been touted as a battle bigger than the one merely between willow and leather. There is this talk of pressure on players How unsettling the excitement and tension of playing this match can be, how the noise from the stands can get the better of discretion and all that. The teams concerned didnt seem to be weighed down a wee bit by this ultra-cricket element! Maybe even the A team players are hardened professionals these days, courtesy the busy cricket calendar. Most Indians certainly are, even though they are doing duty for the A team here. Its an important match, not a big one. Its important to win here, snapped Indian captain Hemang Badani, when asked whether there would be pressure. All nervousness disappears once the players step onto the ground, noted Pakistan A coach Naveed Anjum. The visitors seemed to relax on match-eve. The bowlers had short work-outs at CCFC in the morning while the rest chose to stretch and use the hotel swimming pool to cool limbs ahead of the hot match. This was followed by lunch at Aminia and watching Kal Ho Naa Ho at Metro. Sure, they wanted the players to rest a day after losing to Sri Lanka A. The Indians, though had a routine work-out in the morning. Apart from so called culture and lifestyle, the rival teams share an unusually common track record going into the crunch match. Both were beaten in their first outing after tallying 300, both didnt get as many runs from the middle-order as was expected after two good starts. And last but not the least, bowlers of both teams, seamers in particular, failed to make any impact against the marauding Lankans. And there is more as far as strategy is concerned, for Thursdays match. Both camps feel one outing is far too little to make changes in the playing XI and wish to go ahead without alterations, barring injury problems. Indians dont have any and the Pakistanis are confident that opener Imran Nazir will recover from the back strain suffered in Tuesdays match against Sri Lanka. Speedster Mohammed Irshad is still not fully fit, and coach Anjum said he will wait till his fastest weapon gets back to 100 per cent. The performance of seamers should keep the teams worried and somewhat ironically, encourage them too. The new ball did do a bit in either session, on the pitch to be used in Thursdays match. Consistency would surely have yielded better results. The first few overs in the opening session can still make a difference. And thats why the teams are going in with adequate depth in batting. The team with more batsmen who can bowl should call the shots. Holding the nerves will still be an important aspect.  LIKELY TEAMS India A: Gautam Gambhir, Sanjay Bangar, Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh, Hemang Badani, Dinesh Mongia, Ajay Ratra, Sairaj Bahutule, Sarandeep Singh, Amit Bhandari, Munaf Patel. Pakistan A: Shahid Afridi, Imran Nazir, Salman Butt, Mohammed Hafeez, Faisal Iqbal, Naved Latif, Bilal Asad, Amin-ur Rehman, Junaid Zia, Mansoor Amjad, Rouf Khan.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Becks back home
London, June 14 (Reuters): Manchester Uniteds David Beckham returned from the US Saturday newly honoured (with the OBE) but with his future still unclear. He jetted in from Los Angeles 35 minutes late with his wife Victoria and their two children at the end of a three-week trip aimed at boosting the couples US image. They were whisked away through a side entrance to a waiting car, dodging a horde of media in the arrivals hall. There was little chance to quiz him as the couple headed off, although the England captain declared with a smile: I am truly honoured. An airlines spokesman said: In the interest of safety for the Beckham family and other passengers, an alternative route out of the airport be taken. After a three-day break it is back to more promotional work for Beckham starting on Wednesday in Japan before moving on, with Malaysia, Vietnam and Thailand also on the itinerary.  Copyright

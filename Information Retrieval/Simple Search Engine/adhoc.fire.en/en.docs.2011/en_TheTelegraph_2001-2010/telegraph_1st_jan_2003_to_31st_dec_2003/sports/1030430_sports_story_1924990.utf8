 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagan have just completed a nightmarish soccer season but the cricketers are doing their bit to maintain the clubs reputation as a premier sporting institution. Having already clinched the CAB League championship and the A.N. Ghosh Memorial Trophy, Mohun Bagan lifted the J.C. Mukherjee meet with a convincing six-wicket win over Tollygunge Agragami Tuesday. Last season, too, Mohun Bagan had achieved a triple-crown winning the CAB knockout, A.N. Ghosh and J.C. Mukherjee titles. Chasing 175, Mohun Bagan began Day II on 25 without loss and doubled the score before losing their first wicket. Deep Dasgupta then fell for 18 but opener Amitava Chakraborty anchored the innings with a patient 68. BRIEF SCORES Tollygunge Agragami 174. Mohun Bagan 175/4 (Amitava Chakraborty 68, Kunal Bajpai 2/54). Bagan won by 6 wkts.  Copyright

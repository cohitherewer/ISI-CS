 Becks boy in escalator scare 
 London: England captain David Beckhams younger  son Romeo was rushed to hospital after he fell during a  shopping trip in Madrid with his grandmother, The Sun  reported on Tuesday.  One-year-old Romeo needed two stitches to his forehead  after stumbling on an escalator at an El Cortes Ingles department  store in the Spanish capital, where his dad plays for Real  Madrid. Romeo and his brother Brooklyn,4, were out shopping with Davids mother Sandra at the time. Beckham and his pop star wife Victoria rushed to the hospital to be with their son while he was being treated. Romeo has only just started to walk so he is quite unsteady on his feet, a family friend told The Sun.  As they came to the bottom of an escalator, he lost  his footing and fell over and cut his head. There was quite  a lot of blood.  (AFP)  Copyright

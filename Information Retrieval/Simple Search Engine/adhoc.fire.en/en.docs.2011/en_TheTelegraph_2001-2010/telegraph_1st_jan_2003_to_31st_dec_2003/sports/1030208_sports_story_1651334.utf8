 WI need to tighten bowling: Sobers
Johannesburg: West Indian cricket legend Garfield Sobers thinks his country has a good chance of winning the World Cup provided some loopholes are plugged in the bowling department. Speaking in St Lucia Thursday, Sobers said West Indies had a very solid batting line-up but the bowlers needed some improvement. I think that with their kind of batting line-up, if they perform to their ability, they have a chance, Sobers said. They only have to teach their bowlers how to bowl properly and to bowl a good line and length. And if things are not happening, how to try and contain batsmen. Once they do that, I think they have a good chance. Sobers said the bowlers did not lack in ability but needed to apply themselves well. I have been hearing for so many years and for so long that we dont have any bowlers. I think that we have a number of good bowlers. I think what we have to do as I have been saying on so many occasions is to teach them how to bowl. West Indies, winners of the first two editions of the World Cup in 1975 and 1979, face hosts South Africa in the opening game at Newlands on Sunday and Sobers predicted it to be a very tough match. Tough match. Very, very tough match. South Africa is always going to be a tough game particularly at home.  (PTI)  Copyright

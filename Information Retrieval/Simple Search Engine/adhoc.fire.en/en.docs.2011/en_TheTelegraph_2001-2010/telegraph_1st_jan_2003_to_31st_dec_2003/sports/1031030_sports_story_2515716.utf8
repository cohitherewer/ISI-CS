The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Trainer prescribes soft surface
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Bengal cricket has taken a step in the right direction by bringing in a physical trainer and psychologist for the senior team. But the trainer, Ranadip Maitra, feels some infrastructure upgradation is needed. Talking to The Telegraph on Wednesday, Maitra, who has worked with India trainer Gregory Allen King during the pre-season conditioning camp in Bangalore, said: What we need immediately is a soft artificial training surface for the physical conditioning of the boys. Maitra informed this sort of a surface is there at the NCA in Bangalore and it gives players the feeling that they are training on grass. The Pankaj Gupta indoor training centre surface here is far too hard. There is fear in the mind of players that they can get injured while training. He feels the stretch outside the indoor stadium is the perfect spot to have this artificial surface and the CAB is interested to have it.

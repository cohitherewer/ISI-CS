The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Two-wheeler state meets set to begin soon
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: State championships, culminating in a national event of two-wheeler rallies, are set to take off early next year. This is the obvious fallout of the in-coma national four-wheeler rally circuit. Vicky Chandhok of Madras Motor Sports Club, who was today re-elected president of the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India (FMSCI) for another term of a year, said he was eager to get on with the regulation events (FMSCI has the FIM accreditation) which are cheaper to organise and easier to promote. Chandhok told The Telegraph over phone from Chennai (where the elections were held) that he is eager also for desert rallies and the like, things that can provide motorsport in the country with a high profile. Srikant Karani of Mumbai is the executive vice-president (to look after the karting activities) and Bengal Motor Sports Clubs Rajat Majumdar remains the other vice-president (to look after the rallying activities). The first state to have the two-wheeler rally event will be Karnataka.  Copyright

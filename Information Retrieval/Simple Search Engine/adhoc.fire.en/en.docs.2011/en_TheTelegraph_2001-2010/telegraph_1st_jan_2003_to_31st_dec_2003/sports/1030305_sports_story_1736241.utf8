The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harbhajan back in contention
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  HARBHAJAN: Waiting in the wings Cape Town: Its not the norm to drop a player after one game only, but theres a reasonable chance that Anil Kumble will have to make way for Harbhajan Singh in Indias opening Super Six match, against Kenya, Friday. Kumble, it may be recalled, was preferred over Harbhajan in the key game versus Pakistan last Saturday, but made no impression and went wicketless for 51. The senior pro got the nod on account of his experience yet, at no time, did he command respect from any batsman. In the circumstances, it wont surprise if Harbhajan makes the XI in three days time, a well-placed source told The Telegraph Tuesday. As the wicket here is partial towards seamers, the thinktank could even be tempted to play Ajit Agarkar in Dinesh Mongias place. Whether that will actually come about, remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the Indians, who arrived from Pretoria (via Johannesburg) in the afternoon, had their first workout in three days (at Newlands). The Indian contingent, of course, has increased by one with the arrival of Fatima, Agarkars wife. Captain Sourav Gangulys wife and daughter, who were expected to join him before the Super Six, wont be coming owing to an illness in the family.  Copyright

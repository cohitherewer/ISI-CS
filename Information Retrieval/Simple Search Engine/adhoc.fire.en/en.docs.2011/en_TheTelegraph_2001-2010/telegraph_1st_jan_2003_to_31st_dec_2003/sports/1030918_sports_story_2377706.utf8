The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourashish, Shukla in squad
Mumbai: Bengal allrounder Laxmi Ratan Shukla and off spinner Sourashish Lahiri have been named in the India under-23 squad for the tri-series meet in Colombo from September 27 to October 5. Both Shukla and Lahiri left for Chandigarh this evening with the Bengal squad to participate in the JP Artroi invitation meet. Both Shukla and Sourashish have had stints at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. Shukla, who made his debut for India against Sri Lanka in Nagpur in 1999, has played three one-day Internationals. Sourashish on the other hand had a very good couple of seasons, but missed out on an India A berth. However, he strengthened his claims following an excellent outing at the KSCA tournament in August, which the CAB XI won. Delhi opener Gautam Gambhir will lead the side. Mumbai opener Vinayak Mane and pacer Avishkar Salvi along with Tamil Nadu fast bowler L. Balaji and Baroda speedster Irfan Pathan are also in the squad. Hosts Sri Lanka and Pakistan are the other two teams in the fray.  THE SQUAD Gautam Gambhir (captain), Vinayak Mane, Avishkar Salvi, M. Bisla, A. T.

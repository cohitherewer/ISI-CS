The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne to turn it again within a week
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Adelaide: Shane Warne, Test crickets most successful spinner who is currently serving a 12-month ban for taking diuretics, will resume bowling within a week. He has been off cricket from the middle of February. Except a bit of bowling in a charity engagement, I havent touched the ball... In a few days, though, Ill be back at nets, Warne told The Telegraph on Friday afternoon. He confirmed his comeback would be under Terry Jenners supervision. Earlier, in an interview over TV, Warne said he was hoping to be picked for the tour of Sri Lanka later this season: I reckon there will be two-three spinners... However, my selection will probably be influenced by my presentation during the domestic matches (for Victoria)... He has, of course, shed much weight. Warne, it may be recalled, was sent home from this years World Cup even before the defending champions launched their campaign. Meanwhile, Western Australian batsman Michael Hussey has been appointed captain of the Australia A side which takes on India in Hobart from December 19-21. Michael Clarke, who was in action during the recent tri-series, has been named his deputy. The XI is: Hussey, Clarke, Chris Rogers, Martin Love, Brad Hodge, Cameron White, Wade Secombe, Matthew Nicholson, Damien Wright, Paul Rofe and Shaun Tait. The XIIth man will be a Tasmanian player. Incidentally, the line-up includes Victorias Hodge, who creamed 264 off the Indians in their tour-opener last month.  Copyright

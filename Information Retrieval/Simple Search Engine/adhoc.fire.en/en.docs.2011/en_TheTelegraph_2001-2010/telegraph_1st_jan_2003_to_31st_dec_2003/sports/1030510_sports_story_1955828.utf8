The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mohun Bagan tossed out 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Kalighat rode their luck and the afternoon shower to beat Mohun Bagan to a berth in the P. Sen Trophy final Friday. Chasing 207 to win in 42 overs in the semi-final at Eden Gardens (each innings reduced by three overs due to a late start, caused by the wet outfield), Kalighat had crawled to 67 for four in 16 overs when the elements brought the days proceedings to a premature halt. Since a minimum of 21 overs were required to decide a 42-overs-per side match, the umpires decided to go for the toss of coin, which rolled in favour of Kalighat. Kalighat will meet the winners of East Bengal and Tollygunge Agragami in Wednesdays final. Mohun Bagans highly successful season, during which they won three trophies, thus came to an unfortunate end. Their innings was boosted by contributions of 68 not out and 53 from Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Subhamoy Das, respectively. BRIEF SCORES Mohun Bagan 206/7 in 42 ovs (Laxmi Ratan Shukla 68 n.o., Subhamoy Das 53). Kalighat 67/4 in 16 ovs (Samad Akhtar 3/24). Kalighat won by virtue of toss after rain stopped play.

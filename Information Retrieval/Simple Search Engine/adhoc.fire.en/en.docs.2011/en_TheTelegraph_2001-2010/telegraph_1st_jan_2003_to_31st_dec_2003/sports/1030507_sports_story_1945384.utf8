 Yuvraj to play for Yorkshire
Chandigarh: Stylish left-hander Yuvraj Singh will play for Yorkshire this season, an opportunity which he considers will help improve his cricket. I will play for Yorkshire for four months starting a fortnight from now. I will be playing 10-12 four-day games which will be a good opportunity for me. Also, playing under tough conditions will help improve my game, said Yuvraj. Sachin Tendulkar was the first overseas pro to play for Yorkshire in 1992. My seniors have told me that batting on English tracks is going to be a challenge. Overall, the conditions should be good for cricket, the 21-year-old added. Asked if he was eyeing a Test berth by virtue of his performances in the County, Yuvraj said: I want to perform. Whether my performance helps me gain a Test entry will depend on the selectors. Yuvraj said playing in four-day games would help him build the temperament required for the longer version of the game. I will play in nearly 10-12 four-day games. I think that will help if Im selected for the Test side, he said. Talking about his decision to don Yorkshire colours, he said: They made me comfortable and I eventually decided to go with them. He, however, is not worried by the amount of cricket he has to play in the next few months. If you have been playing for eight or ten years in a row, then maybe you need some break. But for guys like me who have just started their careers, I do not think any break is required. For us, this is the time to play cricket.  (PTI)  Copyright

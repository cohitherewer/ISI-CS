The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Experience versus exuberance
	 - Indians take on Sri Lanka in Asian a championship final at the Eden today  BY INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Yuvraj Singh and  Dinesh Mongia during practice at Eden Gardens on Monday  Monday. . Pictures  by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: The batting blues  of Melbourne is not keeping the India A camp pre-occupied.  The Hemang Badanis and the Yuvraj Singhs are more concerned  about taking the earliest flight out of the city on Tuesday  evening to have more time at home in preparing for the tri-series  Down Under. Sri Lanka, as an opposition, are hardly causing any worry to the Indians and it is the relaxed atmosphere that has kept the players in high spirits on the eve of the Kenstar Asian A championship final. This tournament is not about winning, it is more about helping the youngsters gain experience and prepare for tougher battles ahead. The excellent rapport players of the three teams shared has been the biggest gain here. They exchanged thoughts and also helped each other in improving their technique, explained India A coach Sandeep Patil. On paper, the Indians are way ahead in experience. Only Russel Arnold and Nuwan Zoysa can match the hosts on that count, but it will be the collective effort and the ability to get the basics right on the given day that will decide the outcome. I think its quite even If we play to our potential, we shouldnt have any problems, Lankan skipper Arnold stressed after nets. A point reiterated by Sandeep Patil. We shouldnt be happy with what we have achieved. After experiencing a few hiccups in our first game and came back strongly. But theres always room for further improvement, the coach said. Mohammed Kaif had already been ruled out and Rohan Gavaskar on Monday could not turn up for practice because of high temperature. He is unlikely to play, opening the door for Sridharan Sriram. The Tamil Nadu batsman may open with Gautam Gambhir. Bengal spinner Shib Sagar Singh practised with Badani amp; Co. and will field on Tuesday, if necessary. Amit Bhandari, who was rested on Sunday, will be back in place of Siddarth Trivedi. The positives for the Indians from this meet have not been much  Gambhirs batting and Bhandaris wicket-taking ability have been the exceptions. It would definitely have made sense to try out a few more rookies at the international level. How much help the presence of the Yuvrajs and Bangars would be for the concept of such A-level meets is a debatable issue. If helping them stay match-fit had been the idea behind such a move, then Ranji Trophy matches could have served the purpose. For the untested and the untried, this experience on home turf would have come as a huge boon. The Lankans will definitely put themselves ahead on this issue. The performances of Pervez Maharoof and Naveed Nawaz will go a long way in moulding their careers. They will look to make up for their lack of maturity with youthful exuberance. In the process, the gains will outnumber the negatives. As Arnold said, they will have to look to discipline their bowling in the final. Off-spinner Samantha Jayantha is nursing a finger injury and that is keeping Arnold slightly worried. I hope he recovers in time, said the skipper. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath has also been impressive. The pitch has already started to bear the brunt of the wear and tear of the many matches that have been played on the square. The assistance may not be alarming for the batsmen, but surely a source of encouragement for the slow bowlers. It could well boil down to a battle of nerves and the hosts will once more enjoy the advantage.

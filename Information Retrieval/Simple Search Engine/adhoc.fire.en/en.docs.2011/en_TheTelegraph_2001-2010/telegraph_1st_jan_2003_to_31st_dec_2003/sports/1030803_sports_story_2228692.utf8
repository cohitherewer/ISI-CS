The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ties may be pushed back
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Aug. 2: The semi-finals and final of the Federation Cup may be postponed by four-five days, if conditions at the Salt Lake Stadium do not improve. IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said on Saturday that they are sympathetic to East Bengals demand that a tournament of this stature cannot be held in the prevailing conditions. Were ready to bear the extra expenses if the meet is carried forward by a few days, he added. In fact, the East Bengal versus Vasco match on Monday can also be deferred by a day, if necessary. AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco, who will be in the city on Sunday to discuss the issue, has been informed. However, Dutta made it clear that the semi-finals or the finals cannot be shifted to a different ground. Though the Howrah Stadium and East Bengal ground are in better shape, they do not have proper dressing rooms. The positioning of TV cameras is also a problem, he said. However, repair work at the Salt Lake Stadium has started and Dutta said he is getting the state government support.  Copyright

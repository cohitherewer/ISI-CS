 Rookie Deedar makes cut
New Delhi: Deedar Singh was the lone new face in the national squad as the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) on Friday announced an 18-member squad for the Champions Trophy starting next week in Amstelveen, Holland. Deedar made it to the side in place of an indisposed Sandeep Michael, who was a member of the team that won the title in Hamburg in June, IHF sources said. Former captain Mukesh Kumar, who was left out after making a comeback to the side for the twin-leg tournament in Australia, also failed to win his place back for the tournament. The squad led by Dhanraj Pillay will leave for Holland on August 11. They will take on defending champions Holland in their opening match of the six-nation tournament on August 16. Besides India and Holland, Pakistan, Australia, Germany and Argentina are the other teams in fray. Coached by Rajinder Singh, India will go to the tournament on a high, having won two titles in Australia and Germany in the recent past. The team, boasting enough young talent, is certainly confodent. THE SQUAD Dhanraj Pillay, Devesh Chauhan, Kamaldeep Singh, Dilip Tirkey, Kanwalpreet Singh, Jugraj Singh, Ignace Tirkey, Viren Rasquinha, Vikram Pillay, Bimal Lakra, V.S. Vinay, Baljit Singh Saini, Gagan Ajit Singh, Prabhjot Singh, Tejbir Singh, Deepak Thakur, Deedar Singh, Baljit Singh Dhillon. Chief Coach: Rajinder Singh.  (PTI)  Copyright

		 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Jeev, Atwal start well
				 	 JEEV																								New Delhi: Indian golfers were on a high on the opening day of the $900,000 Caltex Singapore Masters on Thursday.																								Jeev Milkha Singh carded a superb six-under 66 in the opening round to be placed just one stroke behind the leader, Englands Benn Barham on a rain-interrupted day. Defending champion Arjun Atwal also made an impressive start before his round was cut short by thunderstorm. Playing in the same group as world No. 2 Ernie Els, Atwal was five-under after 15 holes. 																								Tied with Jeev were Paul Broadhurst and Simon Khan of England. Leader Barham, playing without any practice round, shot a seven-under 65, according to information received here. 																								Atwal was five-under after 15 holes, while Els made four birdies in the last five holes to join Atwal in the fifth spot.																								Among other Indians, Jyoti Randhawa, shot a two-under 70, which included a depressing double bogey on the final hole. 																								India-born Swede Daniel Chopra birdied his first three holes and was three-under after six holes, while Amandeep Johl was level par after nine. 																								Arjun Singh struggled to a four-over after nine holes, and Harmeet Kahlon made a triple and a double bogey on the third and fourth holes to finish the day at a forgettable five-over 77.  (PTI)

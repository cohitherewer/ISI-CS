		 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Flintoff, Giles make the cut
				 	 Flintoff: On way to full recovery																								Sydney: England Tuesday named injury-plagued Andrew Flintoff and Ashley Giles in their final 15-man squad for the February-March World Cup in South Africa.																								Flintoff and Giles both returned home from Englands cricket tour of Australia to recover from injuries.																								Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney said Flintoff was recovering well from complications after mid-year hernia surgery, while spinner Giles had been given the go-ahead to begin training after breaking his wrist during net practice in Adelaide.																								Selectors also included sidelined Craig White in the squad after the Yorkshire allrounder damaged side muscles bowling in the Boxing Day Test against Australia in Melbourne.																								White is expecting to take three to six weeks to recover, in time to play in the World Cup.																								Opener Michael Vaughan, who did not play in Englands early matches of the triangular one-day series with Australia and Sri Lanka, is back in the one-day squad after a brilliant 145 against Australia in the fourth Ashes Test last weekend.																								I am satisfied that the players selected in this squad represent the best mix of experience and youth that England has available to it, Graveney said in a statement.																								The unavailability of several key players for various reasons over recent months has given us the opportunity to bring in a number of young players into our plans. 																								Several of these players have responded extremely well to the challenge and we have had no hesitation in including them in the squad. 																								Graveney said Flintoff had been bowling at around 90 per cent capacity in the nets back in Lancashire and was experiencing less pain than he had in Australia. The indications from the ECB medical officer are that Andrew will be fit and able to play a full part in the World Cup, said Graveney.																								Graveney said Giles had bowled six overs in the nets last weekend without suffering a reaction and he was satisfied the left-arm spinner would play.

 Unbeaten run motivates Aussies 
Port-of-Spain: Australias run of 21 successive wins in one-day Internationals is motivating the world champions in their bid to inflict a 7-0 whitewash on the West Indies, says skipper Ricky Ponting. We enjoy every win...we havent made that much of a deal (of the unbeaten run), Ponting told reporters after his team went 4-0 up in the series with a 67-run triumph on Saturday. It was a very good win today, the boys batted very sensibly, our openers got us off to a great start and gave us a platform to launch from and Clarkey did well again, Ponting said. We decided to keep as many wickets in hand for the end as we could and give ourselves a really good platform and thats the way it worked out. We decided to open the bowling with Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie today, a bit of extra pace, and it seemed to work for us and when Glenn McGrath came on in the middle, he kept things tight and got their run-rate up.. . The West Indies were under pressure from there. I told the guys this morning that we can use the successive wins as motivation for the rest of this series. If we keep thinking about that record and wanting to stretch it, then Im sure we can keep playing well. Maintaining the unbeaten record through the recent World Cup was a special achievement, Ponting said. Looking back to the whole World Cup and some of the things that happened before, and during, it was an unbelievable effort for us to come through undefeated and to keep it going, he said. Meanwhile, West Indies captain Lara praised the Australians for their commanding game. We bowled well in patches, but again Australia was able to consolidate, keep wickets in hand and have a go at the end, Lara said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

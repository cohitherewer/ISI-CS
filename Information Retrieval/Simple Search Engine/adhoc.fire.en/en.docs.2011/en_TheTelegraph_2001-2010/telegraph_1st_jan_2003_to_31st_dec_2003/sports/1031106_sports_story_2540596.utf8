The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ross plays down Fleming allegations
 FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR Cuttack: Stephen Fleming may have flayed the scheduling of the ongoing triangular series saying it was aimed to suit the hosts but coach Ashley Ross on Wednesday dismissed the skippers remarks as personal observations. I think its important to understand that any complaint has to come from New Zealand Cricket (NZC). What Stephen has said was his own observation which was supported by Ricky Ponting as well. What we are looking forward to now is playing a great Indian side tomorrow, Ross said after an hours nets in the evening. The Board of Control for Cricket in India has, however, refuted the allegations saying he should target NZC for okaying the itinerary. The visitors are not complaining any more and even the delayed arrival of their kits hasnt irked them. Rather, they are looking at the positives emerging out of the disputes. Professional athletes dont concern themselves with things that are out of their reach. These things dont worry us. As soon as the kits arrived, we were ready to train under lights, something which even the Indians havent, the coach remarked. Even the lack of practice in Mumbai on Tuesday, since security arrangements could not be made in a hurry, has not irritated the visiting coach. Our preparations have not been hampered in anyway. The rigours of international cricket is such that rest is always welcome. So its really a matter of trusting in your preparations and trusting in yourself, Ross explained. The successive defeats to Australia have not affected their morale, insisted the coach. The way we turned around from 21 for four to reach 258 in our previous game in Pune was outstanding. The important thing is we are gaining momentum. Im sure we will get some good conditions here and that will bring the best out of the boys. Ross conceded that the absence of Nathan Astle was being felt but it has also brought the best out of the team. Weve shown that even when the top-order players are missing, were going to be very competitive. We nearly beat the world champions and the match was decided in the last over, he remarked. The coach admitted they were under pressure but added: Top or bottom of the table doesnt really matter. What we have to try and do is fire on all cylinders. Weve set our eyes on the immediate task ahead of us, that is to play India and hopefully come up with a great performance. The fielding in Pune has left the team management disappointed and they are hoping to make amends. Certainly were disappointed dropping two vital chances. But it was a mistake and Im sure well come up with a better display tomorrow night.  Copyright

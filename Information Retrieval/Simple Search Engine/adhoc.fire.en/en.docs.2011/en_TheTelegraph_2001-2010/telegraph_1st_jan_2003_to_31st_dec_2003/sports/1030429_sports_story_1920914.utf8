The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ronaldinhos United move on backburner
 Ronaldinhos move will be a financial loss for Paris St Germain Paris: Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldinho will remain at Paris St Germain next season after scoring twice to help them reach the French Cup final, the clubs major shareholder pledged on Monday. The midfielder could probably find a place in any club side in the world and is on the wanted list at Manchester United, according to recent British media reports. Ronaldinho returned to his best form and struck both goals as PSG beat Girondins Bordeaux 2-0 on Sunday. They will face AJ Auxerre in the final at the Stade de France on May 31 in their only chance to win silverware this season after failing to challenge for the league title. Tonights match gives me the will to carry on playing as long as I can, said Ronaldinho. When the fans are chanting my name, I want to give my very best. The Brazilian has not made up his mind about his future but has repeatedly hinted that he wanted to leave the French first division club by the end of the season. Asked about his future, the midfielder declined to answer saying that he was now only looking forward to the French Cup final and nothing else. I really want to give the Parisian fans this Cup. My job is to take care of what is going on the pitch, he said. If Bertrand Meheut, the new chairman of television channel Canal Plus, PSGs main shareholder, has any influence, the Brazilian playmaker will stay. Ronaldinho cant be transferred. From a financial point of view it would be a loss, said Meheut who was said by press reports to be asking 50 million euros for the player. Right place Ronaldinho must be used more often in this team, he said. However, after falling out with PSG coach Luis Fernandez after failing to return on time from a break in January, the coach has restricted his appearances. Their relationship was not helped when the Fernandez substituted Ronaldinho two weeks ago in a league match at Nantes. I want to play as much as I can, he said at the time. I dont like to have to go back to the bench during a game. Fernandez, who refused to comment on that issue, announced in March that he planned to leave the club in June and has been linked with several jobs in Europe, including the vacant managers job at Premier League Fulham. Chairman Laurent Perpere will be on his way too and will be replaced by former Lille head Francis Graille who said he was keen to hire Stade Renness coach Vahid Halilhodzic to take over from Fernandez. Ronaldinho enjoyed an extremely successful World Cup in Japan last June and scored one of the most memorable finals goals of all time when he lobbed Englands David Seaman with a 30-metre free kick to give Brazil a 2-1 quarter final victory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another innings loss for Bangla
 - Pollock snaps up two on Day IV as SA canter to series whitewash  South African skipper Graeme Smith with the championship trophy in Dhaka Sunday. (Reuters) Dhaka: South Africa needed just 13 minutes to wrap up the second Test against Bangladesh by an innings and 18 runs at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Sunday. Bangladesh, needing 24 runs to make South Africa bat again, could add just six runs on the fourth day as Shaun Pollock struck twice in four balls. Resuming on 204 for eight after conceding a 228-run first innings lead, the home side could not deny South Africa its fourth successive innings victory over Bangladesh. Bangladesh lost the first Test by an innings and 60 runs in Chittagong and had lost both matches of a two-Test series by similar margins in South Africa last year. South African captain Graeme Smith took the new ball immediately on Sunday, with Pollock and Makhaya Ntini using it well to end the match efficiently. Tapas Baishya remained unbeaten as his partners fell on the other side. Mohammad Salim was caught in the close-cordon and last-man Mashrafe bin Mortaza was bowled. Smith thus had the satisfaction of scoring convincing wins in his first two Tests at the helm. It is easy to say that we just beat Bangladesh but all of us had to adapt to the conditions here. Our bowlers bowled well, we had some good partnerships and so did well overall, said 22-year-old Smith. It has been a wonderful experience playing in the sub- continent and we know it will help us in the future, said Smith. We will be off to England in some weeks and hope to carry our form from here, he added. Left-handed batsman Jacques Rudolph, declared Man of the Series, was the find of the tour for South Africa. He struck a rare unbeaten double-century on debut (222 not out) in the first Test and followed it up with a well-made 71 in the next. For Bangladesh, though, it was just another result in a dismal record as they have now lost 18 of 19 Tests since gaining Test status in 2000, the only draw coming in a rain- hit match against Zimbabwe. The loss here came in just over three days despite two rain-affected sessions on the second day. Bangladesh captain Khaled Mahmud gave full marks to South Africa but felt his team was capable of doing better. They played well under unfavourable conditions but our batsmen were guilty of getting out in 20s and 30s. We lacked application, said Mahmud.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Vasco held 2-2 in opener 
Margao, Nov. 29 (PTI): Kamal Thapas late goal helped Vasco hold new entrants Hayward 2000 Sporting 2-2 in their opening National Football League match at the Nehru Stadium on Saturday. Vasco took the lead in the eighth minute when Brazilian Edson T. DCastro converted a penalty after Amaechi Tochukwu was tripped inside the box by Sporting defender Akshay Das. But Sporting created more scoring chances and drew parity in the 43rd minute when Bibiano Fernandes 35-yard shot beat keeper Ramos all ends up. After the change of ends, Sporting, playing a more organised game in the midfield, pressed hard and took the lead in the 83rd minute when Louis Aniwetas header found the target off an Andrade flag-kick from the right. Vasco equalised when Sushant Matthew broke free on the right after being fed by a long pass by defender Agnelo Colaco and sent a measured cross to Thapa whose powerful header found the far corner of the net.

 Caddick vows to come back 
 Caddick is encouraged by the return of Gough London: Andrew Caddick has insisted he will resume his England career even though a back injury has ruled him out for the rest of the season. I know what some peoples reaction will be to the news that I am out for the summer, fast bowler Caddick wrote in Wednesdays Daily Express. At 34 they will presume I am finished as a Test cricketer. Well Im not. I still believe I am the best bowler in this country and I intend to prove it in an England sweater again, the New Zealand-born quick added. Somerset paceman Caddick, who announced his retirement from one-day Internationals after Englands first round exit at the World Cup with the aim of prolonging his Test career, has a prolapsed disc in his back. On Tuesday he was ruled out of Englands forthcoming five Test home series against South Africa. He explained that his back problem had been aggravated by the stress fracture hed suffered in his right foot. I now have a prolapsed disc in my back which the medics think may have been caused by walking around with a cast on my right foot. While that has helped sort out my stress fracture, the imbalance caused by walking around with one leg an inch higher than the other has not helped my back. Caddick added that he had faced a career-threatening injury before when shin splints forced him out for a season. But I came out the other side and fully intend to do the same again this time. Somerset and England have not seen the last of Andy Caddick yet, he added. Caddick also said that he was encouraged by the example of his England new-ball partner Darren Gough, who has returned from several knee operations to take part in all six one-day Internationals played by England so far this season. Yorkshire fast bowler Gough, 32, said of Caddick: Hes been a great partner for me with the ball and Ive been a great partner for him. I hope he gets back.  (AFP)  Copyright

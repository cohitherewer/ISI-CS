The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara, Gayle run riot
 - First ODI - Zimbabwe buried under 347  Lara (top) hit his  18th ODI ton and Gayle a career-best 153 n.o. Bulawayo, Nov. 22 (AFP): Chris Gayle made a career-best 153 not out and took two wickets for 21 to take the West Indies to a comfortable 51-run victory over Zimbabwe in the first ODI on Saturday. The visitors won on the Duckworth-Lewis method after scoring 347 for six. Zimbabwe replied with 173 for three in 34.5 overs before rain washed out the game. Brian Lara scored 113, his 18th ODI century, and overtook Desmond Haynes for the most one-day centuries scored for the West Indies. Gayle made a return to form with an undefeated 153 in 158 balls while captain Lara, who won the toss, was even more aggressive, piling up 113 runs off just 105 balls. Lara struck three sixes and 14 fours to record his 18th ODI century. Zimbabwe kept Gayle and Wavell Hinds quiet in the opening overs, as only 13 runs came from the first four overs. But it was a calm before the storm. The run rate steadily climbed, Gayle beginning to celebrate his return to form and with Lara at his irrepressible best. They moved quickly through four an over, then five, on towards six during the 42nd over and well over that in the final stages of the innings. The going was hard and tormenting for Zimbabwe and they were almost always on the defensive. Heath Streak was unfortunate not to get Gayle caught behind with a couple of unplayable balls early on.

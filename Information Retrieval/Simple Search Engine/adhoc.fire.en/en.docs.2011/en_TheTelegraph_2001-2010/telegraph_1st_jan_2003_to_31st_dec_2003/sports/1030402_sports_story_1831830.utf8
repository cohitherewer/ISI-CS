 Dravid to wed Nagpur doctor
Nagpur: The Indian cricket teams vice-captain and one of the most eligible bachelors in the country, Rahul Dravid has been bowled over by a city girl. Dravid, known as The Wall for his solid defence on any pitch, was won over by Vijeta Pendharkar, a doctor, sources close to the family said here on Tuesday. The batsman from Bangalore had in fact hinted during the just concluded World Cup that he would be tying the knot soon but had kept his choice a secret. The marriage would be solemnised in Bangalore on May 4 and the reception held here on May 10. Vijeta has done her MS from the Nagpur Government Medical College and is the daughter of Wing Commander (retd) S.P. Pendharkar and dietician Jayashree Pendharkar. Dravid would obviously gain from the Indian teams none-too-busy international schedule in the coming months. Barring the Dhaka tri-series, for which Dravid has been excused, India dont play till mid-August. (PTI)  Copyright

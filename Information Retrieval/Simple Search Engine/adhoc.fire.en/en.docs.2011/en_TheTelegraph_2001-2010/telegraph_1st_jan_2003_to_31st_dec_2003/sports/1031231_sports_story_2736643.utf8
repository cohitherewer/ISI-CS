 NZ seek Akram help to counter Shoaib
 Inputs from Akram would be invaluable, feels NZ thinktank Wellington: New Zealand have adopted the if you cant beat em, join em philosophy, sending an SoS to the great Wasim Akram after being humiliated by the reverse-swing of another Pakistani, Shoaib Akhtar, in a shocking seven-wicket loss in the second and deciding Test which ended here on Tuesday. Coach John Bracewell and captain Stephen Fleming raised the prospect of bringing in the retired Pakistani seamer after Akhtars devastating match-winning haul of 11 for 78 gave Pakistan the Test and the two-match series. Akhtar achieved figures of 17 for 89 from the two Tests against New Zealand, whose batsmen failed to get to grips with his extreme pace and swing. Input from Akram would be invaluable, Fleming said. Why not go to the best, and if we can get him, great, Fleming said. Certainly if we can get the best players in the world at that skill, then itd be great to learn. New Zealand have some useful exponents of reverse-swing to call on, namely injured star Shane Bond and former Test players Danny Morrison and left-armer Geoff Allott. But Akram is the master, with 414 Test wickets and 502 one-day scalps.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Damien Fleming retires 
  Fleming will work as coach at the Australian Institute of Sport Adelaide: Damien Fleming has accepted a senior coaching role with the national academy, the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) announced on Thursday.The former Australian Test bowler retired from international cricket on Thursday to begin a two-year appointment as senior coach of the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Cricket Academy in Adelaide.The academy is the finishing school for our talented young elite cricketers, so it will benefit them to have contact with recently retired international players such as Damien, ACB chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement.The South Australian Cricket Association has released Fleming from the final year of his contract. Fleming joined the Redbacks from Victoria for the 2002-03 domestic season but played just five games before suffering a serious shoulder injury.Fleming is replacing Wayne Phillips who has been appointed South Australian coach. He will work under the guidance of head coach Bennett King and will be joining fellow senior coaches John Harmer and David Moore at the academys Adelaide base.Fleming will be responsible for all aspects of coaching, working closely with the academys overseas programme and Dennis Lillees Pace Australia programme.A member of the 1999 World Cup-winning side, Fleming said he agonised over his decision to retire after 15 years in first-class and international cricket.It definitely wasnt a black-and-white decision, he said. I have had a week to wrestle over it but its just a fantastic opportunity to get into coaching which I have had my mind on for a couple of years.The jovial Fleming conceded his appointment may shock people familiar with his public image of an affable jokester. A few people might be surprised, he said. But definitely there is a serious side to me that I probably dont always show to the public.Flemings 20 Tests between 1994-95 and 2000-01 returned 75 wickets at 25.89, and he also represented Australia in 88 one-day Internationals.The swing bowlers 114 first-class appearances for Victoria and South Australia resulted in 379 wickets at 28.28. Former Aussie wicketkeeper Rod Marsh was head coach at the academy before he was lured to England. (Agencies)  Copyright

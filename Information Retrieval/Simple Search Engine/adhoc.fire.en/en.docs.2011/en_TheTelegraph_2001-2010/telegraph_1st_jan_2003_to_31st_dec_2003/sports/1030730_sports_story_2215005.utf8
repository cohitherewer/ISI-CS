The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Probables now on Tuesday
Mumbai: The selection of India probables for the conditioning camp ahead of the home series against New Zealand has been put off by a day. The 25 probables will now be picked on August 5 as one of the selectors, abroad on holiday, will not be available before that date, BCCI executive secretary Sharad Diwadkar said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the BCCI pitches committee will meet on August 5 to decide whether Kanpur will host a Test against New Zealand, adds a report from New Delhi. Mohali and Kanpur were initially named as the Test venues but the relaid pitch at the latter centre has caused confusion.  (PTI)  Copyright

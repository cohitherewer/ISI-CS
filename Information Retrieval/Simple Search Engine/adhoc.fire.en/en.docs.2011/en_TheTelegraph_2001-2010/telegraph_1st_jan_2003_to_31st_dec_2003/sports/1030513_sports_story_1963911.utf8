The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Srichaphan bites the dust
 Feliciano Lopez of Spain, who moved into Round II of the Hamburg Masters beating Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan 6-4, 6-3 Hamburg: Paradorn Srichaphan did not grow up playing on clay courts and it was painfully obvious on Monday when the seventh-seeded Thai lost 4-6, 3-6 to Feliciano Lopez of Spain in the opening round of the Hamburg Masters. Lopez is an accomplished clay-court player and he raced to a 4-0 lead before Srichaphan began making some shots. He fought back to 4-3 but lost the game when he could not retrieve a drop volley by the Spaniard. I almost broke him back for 4-4, Srichaphan said. I hit the ball well but he brought back a lot of balls. In other first-round matches, 12th-seeded Guillermo Coria of Argentina defeated Vincent Spadea of the US 6-2, 6-2 and David Sanchez of Spain rallied to beat American Mardy Fish 5-7, 6-4, 6-2. Also, Wayne Ferreira of South Africa ousted Alexander Waske of Germany 6-3, 6-2 and Finlands Jarkko Nieminen beat Stefan Koubek of Austria 6-4, 0-6, 6-1. Srichaphan has won only two matches in five clay-court tournaments this year. It is tough for me. I did not grow up on clay, he said. But I still try to enjoy it. Last year I did not win a match on clay until the French Open.

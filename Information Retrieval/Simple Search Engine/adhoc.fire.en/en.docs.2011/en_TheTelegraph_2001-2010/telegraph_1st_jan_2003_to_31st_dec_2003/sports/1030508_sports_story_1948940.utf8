The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahela back as deputy
Colombo: Right-handed batsman Mahela Jayawardene has been named Sri Lankas vice-captain for the upcoming one-day tri-series starting on Saturday. Chief selector Lalith Kaluperuma said on Wednesday that a 15-member squad has been named for the meet also featuring Pakistan and New Zealand. The squad includes diminutive wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana and allrounder Upul Chandana. Left-handed batsman Russel Arnold, who was left out of the team that toured Sharjah last month, has also been recalled. Kaushalya Weeraratne, a 22-year-old allrounder, has earned a recall after two years. Michael Vandort, another left-handed opening batsman, will stand in if injured skipper Maravan Atapattu fails to regain fitness, Kaluperuma said.  Jayawardene, 25, has played 48 Tests and 140 ODIs. He was first appointed vice captain when authorities sacked Arjuna Ranatunga and his deputy Aravinda de Silva after a failed 1999 World Cup campaign in England.  The squad Maravan Atapattu (capt.), Mahela Jayawardena (vice capt.), Sanath Jayasuriya, Romesh Kaluwitharana, Kumar Sangakkara, Kumara Dharmasena, Upul Chandana, Russel Arnold, Kaushal Lokuarachchi, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralidharan, Prabath Nissanka, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Kaushalya Weeraratne, Dharshana Gamage, Stand-by: Michael Vandort.

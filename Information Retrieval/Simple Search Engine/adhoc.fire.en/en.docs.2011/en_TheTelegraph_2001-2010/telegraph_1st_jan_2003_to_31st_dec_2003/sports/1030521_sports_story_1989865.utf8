 Sachin on road to recovery
Baltimore: Sachin Tendulkar feels no more pain in his left hand, his doctor has said. I can press on that area and its gone, said Dror Paley, an orthopedic surgeon at Sinai hospital in Baltimore, who operated on Tendulkar three weeks ago. Were real optimistic. Tendulkar will return for a follow-up exam at the hospital where Dr Paley and Dr Steven Friedman operated on him on April 29. Dr Paley said on Monday Tendulkar suffered a torn ligament and tendon that affected the finger joint. Dr Paley said a splint that Tendulkar wore on the repaired finger was removed about a week ago and he has regained motion in the finger. However, the Master Blaster needs to continue therapy for a few months to restore strength to the finger. Dr Paley said his patient has not played any cricket since the operation, but hes already playing golf. He also said Tendulkar told him he aims to get back on the cricket circuit in October. Sachin suffered the injury during the last World Cup in South Africa, and according to the player himself, his fielding was most affected by it.  (AP)  Copyright

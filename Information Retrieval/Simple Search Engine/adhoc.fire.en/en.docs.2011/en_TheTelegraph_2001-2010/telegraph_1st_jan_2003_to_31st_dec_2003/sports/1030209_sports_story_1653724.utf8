Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Feb. 8: The Goliaths in East Bengal proved too powerful for the Davids of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited as the National Football League leaders cantered to a 4-1 victory at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Mike Okoro struck thrice to join Mohun Bagans George Ekeh as top-scorer with ten goals, while Suley Musah hit one as East Bengal widened the gap between them and second-placed Salgaocar by seven points with 30 from 12 matches. Kenneth Onu reduced the margin for HAL, who have seven points. In the 21st minute, a M. Suresh through from the centre pierced the defence and Alvito DCunha collected the ball on the left. His minus found Okoro, who tapped in from close. East Bengal did not wait too long for their second. Musah beat the off-side trap following a deft 38th-minute lob from Arun Malhotra into the box. He blasted home an angular right-footer. Musah earned a penelty just before halftime, which was converted by Okoro. He ensured there should not be any other contender for the Man-of-the-Match award, when he scored his third in the 75th minute. Teams EAST BENGAL: Sandip Nandy; Arun Malhotra, M.

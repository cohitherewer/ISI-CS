 Chaos at Wari AGM
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The opposition faction of Wari AC claimed former Bengal captain Arun Lal has been elected club secretary after a chaotic annual general meeting of the club Wednesday. There was a big scuffle between members of the ruling body and the opposition after the meeting and police had to be posted to bring the situation under control. Lal, a life member of the club, said the ruling body of the club had convened the annual general meeting where most members were absent and passed their nominees uncontested. We then intervened and asked for the meeting to be re-conducted, which was refused, Lal said. He informed the dissidents then conducted a meeting and 79 of the 131 governing body members voted in favour of them. The dissidents claimed that Sailen Ghosh became president. Members of the ruling body said the meeting conducted by the dissidents was completely illegal. The AGM had already taken place, on Wednesday itself, so their claim cannot be taken into account, cricket secretary Prabir Chakraborty said.  Copyright

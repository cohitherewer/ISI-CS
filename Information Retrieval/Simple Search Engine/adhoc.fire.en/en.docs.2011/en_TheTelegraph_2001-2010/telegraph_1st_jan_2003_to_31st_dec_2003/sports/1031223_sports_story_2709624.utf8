				 																																	Perth: Serena Williams, out of action since July because of injury, has pulled out of her scheduled return to competitive tennis.				 																																	Serena, the world No. 3, has not played a tournament since winning the Wimbledon final. She had knee surgery in August and early last month said she had recovered well.				 																																	Hopman Cup director Paul McNamee said Serena withdrew from the mixed teams exhibition tournament to concentrate on her preparation for the Australian Open, which starts in Melbourne on January 19.				 																																	Serena had agreed to partner James Blake at the Hopman Cup to defend the title the pair won last year. McNamee said world No. 5 Lindsay Davenport will replace Serena in the US team.				 																																	Serena regrets not being able to come back and defend her title, but we have a wonderful replacement in Lindsay Davenport, McNamee said. 				 																																	London: Heptathlete Carolina Kluft and triple jumper Christian Olsson, both from Sweden, have been voted European athletes of 2003, the European Athletic Association said on Monday.				 																																	Kluft became one of only three heptathletes to score more than 7000 points when she won the world championships in Paris in August. The last heptathlete to top 7000 was Jackie Joyner-Kersee of the US 11 years ago.				 																																	Twenty-four-year old Olsson has won 15 outdoor competitions in a row and has jumped over 17 metres in 53 out of 55 competitions since 2001.

				 																																	Sydney: Sprinter Patrick Johnson has become the first Australian to break the 10-second barrier for the 100m, clocking 9.93 seconds in Mito, Japan.				 																																	Johnson won the 100m final Monday with a legal tailwind of 1.8 metres per second to become the fastest Australian in history, shattering Matt Shirvingtons national record of 10.03 set in 1998.				 																																	Johnson, 30, becomes the fastest man in the world this year, the 17th fastest man of all time and only the 39th man to clock a legal sub 10-second time.				 																																	American Tim Montgomery holds the world record of 9.78sec, set in Paris last September.				 																																	Tokyo: Operators at eight of the 10 giant stadiums used for last years World Cup football finals expect to run up huge losses again in the year ahead due to lessening demand for usage.				 																																	The eight stadiums, newly built or renovated for the 2002 World Cup, are expected to suffer combined losses of 2.5 billion yen ($ 21 million) in the year to March 2004, the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbun said in a poll.				 																																	They also have no prospects of making profits in the future, the paper said. The expected losses are down by only 340 million yen from estimated losses for the previous fiscal year that ended on March 31, it said.				 																																	Paris: The table tennis world championships will be held as planned later this month despite the outbreak of SARS in the sports leading nations, organisers said on Monday.				 																																	The competitions press chief said the French health ministry had advised that provided the athletes from the most affected countries were closely monitored, there was no reason to reschedule the May 19-25 event in Paris.				 																																	This is the last we heard from the ministry on April 23, Hubert Gueriau said. Its pretty hot as the championships are only two weeks away. But we have not heard anything new since.

Her 135 days in conditions described as the perfect storm made her the first woman to complete the longest race on earth for any individual. 				 																																	I cannot believe this is actually over. I have literally lived, eaten, breathed and slept this race, the she said. It only seems yesterday I set off and yet I have done 30,000 miles. 				 																																	She also survived a battering by what she described as the perfect storm 250 miles from the end of the race. Her vessel was hammered for 10 hours off the east coast of the US.

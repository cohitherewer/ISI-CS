The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India must first be flexible, says Rameez
Islamabad: Hoping that the peace overtures made by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would lead to the normalisation of Indo-Pak cricket ties, newly appointed chief executive of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Rameez Raja Thursday said Pakistan were willing to review their decision not to play in the Asia Cup if India abandoned its rigid approach. Addressing his first press conference after taking over his new post, Raja said in Lahore that until and unless there was a change in Indias stubborn attitude towards cricket relations with Pakistan, his country was not interested in playing with India.

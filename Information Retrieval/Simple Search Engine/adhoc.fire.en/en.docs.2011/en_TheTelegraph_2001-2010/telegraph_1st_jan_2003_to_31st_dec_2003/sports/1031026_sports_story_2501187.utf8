 PCB aims to slot ties in Karachi, Peshawar
Faisalabad, Oct. 25 (Reuters): Pakistan hope to revive Karachi and Peshawar as international venues when India make their scheduled tour early next year, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Saturday. South Africa and New Zealand have both shied away from playing matches this year in Karachi and Peshawar, near the border with Afghanistan, citing safety and security concerns. Although venues have not yet been confirmed for Indias proposed tour, PCB spokesman Samiul Hasan said his Board was determined to stage games in Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta. The international Bugti stadium in Quetta is expected to be completed this winter with floodlights and we would want India to play there next year, Hasan said.  Seven ODIs proposed The Indian government announced on Wednesday the resumption of bilateral cricket ties and the PCB has sent a draft itinerary to its India counterpart including seven one-day internationals and three Tests. Hasan added that the proposed tour would take place between February 19 and April 8. PCB chairman Tauqir Zia is expected to discuss the itinerary with BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya during the ICC executive board meeting in Barbados later this month. The PCB hopes Indias visit will help to recoup some of the financial losses suffered because of cancelled and relocated tours following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. India last visited Pakistan for a full Test series in 1989-90 and Pakistans last tour of India was in 1999.  Copyright

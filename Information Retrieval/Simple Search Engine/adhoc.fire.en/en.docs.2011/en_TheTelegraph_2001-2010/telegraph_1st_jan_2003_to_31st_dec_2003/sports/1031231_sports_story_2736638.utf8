The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Procter curtain on doctoring drama
	 - Curators Pitch-repair work draws match referees attention  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Australian players inspect the pitch in Melbourne on Tuesday. (AFP)  Melbourne: It probably wasnt intentional,  but the MCG groundstaff ended up doctoring the drop-in  wicket. However, umpires David Shepherd and Billy Bowden  intervened and curator Tony Ware backtracked.  According to the official version, the groundstaff  removed a portion of the turf during their mandatory sweeping  after stumps on the fourth day, Monday. That hole, just  short of good length at the Southern Stand end, was noticed  by Ware on Tuesday morning and he promptly filled it with  cement and loose soil. In turn, that repair work was spotted by Bowden, who drew colleague Shepherds attention to the same. Match Referee Mike Procter also came into the picture and Ware was directed to restore the surface to the end-of-fourth-day condition. Ware obliged straightaway. Incidentally, he is neither employed by Cricket Australia nor the state body, Cricket Victoria. Rather, he is on the payroll of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC), which looks after the MCG operations on behalf of the Trust which has been assigned by the state (Victoria) government to oversee the amphitheatre. The MCG is crown property. Procter, though, will report the incident to the International Cricket Council. Of course, he insisted the matter was closed and that nobody had misgivings. I had a chat with the Indian captain too and, while Sourav Ganguly wasnt happy with what was done, he left it to me, Procter pointed out. Sourav himself declined a detailed comment, but did say everybody is aware of the laws... As for Australian captain Steve Waugh, he maintained he wasnt aware of the goings-on till after the third Test had been convincingly won by his team.  Asked by The Telegraph  whether he had encountered something similar, either in  his playing days or as Match Referee, Procter replied: Never...  For me, its been a first... However, he quickly added:  But, then, theres no controversy and we should get on  with the series.  Significantly, going by the laws, repairs can only  be done to the area affected by the bowlers foot holes.  Moreover, once the umpires have taken possession of the  wicket, the curator cant touch it. Ware ought to have known  better.  Copyright

 Subhas draws IFA wrath
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta: Things are not  going too well for Subhas Bhowmick. After a string of low-key  performances by East Bengal following the ASEAN Cup success,  his position has been under the scanner. To add to his woes, now the IFA has decided to summon the coach for some of his remarks made against the association. We had written to East Bengal asking them to explain the remarks of Bhowmick. The club has written that it was entirely the views of the coach and they have nothing to do with it, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said. We want him to face the governing body and explain his comments. If his explanation is not suitable, he will be punished, the secretary added. He informed the governing body meeting will take place in the first week of December. Dutta doesnt agree that this is a little too harsh, especially with the National Football League starting late November. Bhowmick should have been more responsible before making such comments. There is no doubt about the fact that he is guilty and has to face the consequences, Dutta said. However, the secretary added that they will keep in mind that East Bengal are the defending National Football League champions and IFA will see to it that their cause is not affected by it.  Coachs clinic Meanwhile, in a separate development, Anjan Chowdhury, who is associated with Arsenal junior team as a trainer, will have a session with local coaches holding C licence in a 15-day camp here. The Arsenal trainer will come to the city in mid-December.  Copyright

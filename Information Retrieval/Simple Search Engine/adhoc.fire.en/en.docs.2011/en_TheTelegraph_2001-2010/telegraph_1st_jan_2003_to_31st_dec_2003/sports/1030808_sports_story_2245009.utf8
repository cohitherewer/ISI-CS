The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tight security for final
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee Thursday said at Writers Buildings that elaborate security arrangements were being made for the Federation Cup final on Saturday. Bhattacharjee held a meeting with the director general of state police, D.C. Vajpai, during the day and told newspersons that there will be sufficient policemen to tackle any law and order problem. He said a police officer of the rank of an inspector general will be in overall charge on the day of the final. Sports minister Subhas Chakraborty criticised the Mohammedan Sporting club officials for identifying themselves with the unruly mob at the Salt Lake Stadium during the semi-final against Mohun Bagan. He came down heavily on the spectators who had turned unruly on that day. We admit that spectators get swayed by sentiments at a football match but one cannot support unruly behaviour. It is also not proper when authorities come forward and get involved with club supporters, he said, adding that if a group of spectators turn violent they cannot be greeted with flowers. Replying to a question, he said Mohammedan Sporting authorities had neither written to him nor contacted him after Tuesday nights match.  Copyright

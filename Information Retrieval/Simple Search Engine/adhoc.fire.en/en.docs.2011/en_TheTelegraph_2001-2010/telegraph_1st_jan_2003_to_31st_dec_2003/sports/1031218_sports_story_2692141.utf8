 Hussain may get the axe
 Hussain may have to make way for an extra bowler Colombo: Nasser Hussains determined batting and leadership was the focal point of Englands series win in Sri Lanka two years ago, but experience may give way to youth in the third and final Test beginning here on Thursday. Captain Michael Vaughan said the team management was considering fielding an extra bowler for the series-decider at the batsman-friendly Singhalese Sports Club, which will require a batsman to be dropped. The choice of who to leave out of the XI boils down between 90-Test veteran Hussain, under whose captaincy England won the last two series against Sri Lanka, and young batsman Paul Collingwood, who has made a big impression in the two drawn Test matches. If we field an extra bowler, well have to decide whether to choose between the experience of Hussain or Collingwood, whos playing well at the moment, Vaughan said. England thwarted Sri Lankas victory charge in the Galle and Kandy Tests with gritty performances on the final day of both matches. We have to make some hard decisions, said Vaughan. Hard decisions are required when youve got a few good players. Hussain has had a lacklustre tour. He missed the first Test due to a viral infection and managed to score 10 and 17 in the second, during which he was called for a disciplinary hearing by Match Referee Clive Lloyd after the Lankans accused him of calling star bowler Muttiah Muralidharan a chucker and a cheat.

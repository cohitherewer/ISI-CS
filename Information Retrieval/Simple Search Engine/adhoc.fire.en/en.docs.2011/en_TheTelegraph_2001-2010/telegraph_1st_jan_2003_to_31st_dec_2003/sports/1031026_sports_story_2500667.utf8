The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav off injections
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Oct. 25: Doctors treating regular India skipper Sourav Ganguly expressed satisfaction today that the wound resulting from the abscess was healing fine. Dr Sukumar Mukherjee, one of the top doctors treating Sourav, said the injections have been stopped from this morning. Medication now is entirely oral. He said the three-four secondary sutures applied yesterday were helping in the recovery and that the infection has cleared up. He also said that under such circumstances, the patient can be back in action in five to seven days from the date of release. So we can assume he should be fit by the next weekend, depending on how we find him tomorrow, said Dr Mukherjee.  Copyright

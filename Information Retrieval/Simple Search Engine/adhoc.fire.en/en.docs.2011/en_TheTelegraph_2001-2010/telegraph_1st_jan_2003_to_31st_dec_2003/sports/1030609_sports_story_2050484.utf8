 Bangla inquiry flays skipper, team officials
Dhaka: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has come down heavily on the team management for the dismal performance in the World Cup while pledging to heed the recommendations of an inquiry into it. The BCB set up an inquiry in March after Bangladesh failed to win a single match in the World Cup. The findings were announced late last night at a press conference. The committee criticised Khaled Mashud for being irresponsible in his duties as captain and player. The committee also blamed former Pakistani pacer Mohsin Kamal, who was their coach during the World Cup, assistant coach Ali Zia, and manager A.S.M Faruque for not performing their duties properly. The inquiry also had harsh words for administrators and management. However, suggestions of any foul play by skipper Mashud were ruled out.  (AFP)  Copyright

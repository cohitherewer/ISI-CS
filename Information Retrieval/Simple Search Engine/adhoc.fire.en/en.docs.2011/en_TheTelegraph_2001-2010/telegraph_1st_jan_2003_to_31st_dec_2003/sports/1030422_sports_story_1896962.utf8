The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thai ref for NFL match
Chennai: The AIFF has roped in the services of two Thai referees for the crucial NFL match between East Bengal and Vasco, slated for Friday in Calcutta. With just two rounds to be completed, East Bengal, with 46 points, are leading the pack of 12 outfits in the League, followed by Vasco on 40 points. As the outcome of this match will virtually decide the winner, the AIFF has sought the services of foreign referees. This is the first time in the history of the NFL that services of foreign referees have been sought. (PTI)  Copyright

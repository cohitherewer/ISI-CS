 IOA sets deposition deadline 
New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association on Wednesday asked the drug-tainted athletes, who tested positive during the National Games in Hyderabad last year, to depose before its medical commission on April 30 to prove their innocence. After a marathon five-hour meeting here, the medical commission and anti-doping commission of the IOA warned that in case the athletes failed to turn up, it will be presumed that they have nothing to state in their defence. It was decided that as per the IOC/OCA (Olympic Council of Asia) rules, the sportspersons tested positive for banned substances should be given personal hearing by the medical commission/anti-doping commission of the IOA. The hearing panel will meet on April 30, chairman of the commission Dr Manmohan Singh said in a statement after the meeting. Sprinters Jagdish Basak of Punjab and Alapatti Kalyani of Andhra Pradesh have been banned for two years each by the AAFI after they tested positive for anabolic steroid nandrolone. The two were among 22 athletes who tested positive during the Hyderabad Games. Reports of all the 22 positive cases were analysed in the meeting thoroughly and discussed with the scientists of the dope control lab of Sports Authority of India along with reports of some B samples.

 Chandhok third in Round 7
 Karun Chandhok New Delhi: Karun Chandhok finished third in the seventh round of the Formula 3 championship at Knockhill in Scotland Sunday. Karun, a T-Sport driver, had a fairly strong run to third place, finishing three-tenth of a second behind teammate Steven Keane and less than a tenth behind Ernesto Viso, according to information received here Monday. However, the 19-year-old retired from Round 8 following a collision with Ivor McCullough. The result pushed Chandhok, leader after Round 6, down to third place in the championship standings. Chandhok began strongly in the seventh round when he moved up the order on lap one but started losing time from the second lap. Rounds nine and ten of the championship, now moving to the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit, will be held on May 25 and 26.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Ronaldo brace in Real show

Real won 4-2. (Reuters) Hong Kong: Two goals from Ronaldo helped Real Madrid record a comfortable 4-2 victory over a Hong Kong XI on the penultimate leg of the Spanish giants Asian tour on Friday. The Brazilian World Cup star struck in the 13th and 34th minutes as Real turned on the style with some dazzling attacking football to delight a sell-out 40,000 crowd at the Hong Kong Stadium. But while Reals superstar attackers always threatened in front of goal, the Spaniards defensive frailty was exposed by a makeshift Hong Kong side, bolstered by the presence of several mainland Chinese players. The Hong Kong XI embarrassed Real to score twice, Chinas Wang Peng heading home on 26 minutes before Li Yao rifled a shot home from close range on half-time. Yet Real always had plenty in reserve, with new signing David Beckham, French playmaker Zinedine Zidane, Portugals Luis Figo and skipper Raul showing some wonderful touches throughout. Figo opened the scoring with a penalty on seven minutes, coolly placing his spot-kick into the bottom left-hand corner after Hong Kongs Lee Wai-man was adjudged to have tripped Roberto Carlos. Ronaldo added his first six minutes later, bamboozling his marker with three step-overs in quick succession before thundering a low shot past Chinese international goalkeeper An Qi on the near-post to make it 2-0. But Real were jolted out of their easy early stride midway through the half. A rare foray upfield earned Hong Kong a corner, and Chinese international Wang rose from Li Mings cross to head home as Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas flapped. Normal service resumed within minutes though. Raul made it 3-1 for Real on 34 minutes with a delicate chip over An from a tight angle before Ronaldo notched his second  courtesy of a raking 50-metre ball from Beckham  a minute later. With Real replacing most of their star names in the second half the game petered out. Raul went close with an audacious 40-yard chip that hit a post, while Ronaldo squandered a string of chances. Real complete their four-match tour of Asia with a game against Thailand in Bangkok on Sunday.  (AFP)  Copyright

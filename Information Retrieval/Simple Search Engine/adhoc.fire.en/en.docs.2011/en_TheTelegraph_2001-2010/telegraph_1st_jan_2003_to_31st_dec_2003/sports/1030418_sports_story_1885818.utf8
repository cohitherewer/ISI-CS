		 Friday, April 18, 2003  He was sitting on a volcano 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 										Calcutta: Vineet Vermas resignation from RCTC has shocked the racing world. The CEO and secretary has been very popular among club members and stewards who feel an era has ended with him quitting the club. The following are the reactions of some of the present and past chief stewards and senior members members of the club who had directly interacted with Verma:				 										Gen. Shankar Roychowdhury (current chief steward): Its a tremendous loss to the club. He was managing the clubs affair excellently. Wherever he goes now, the organisation will be enormously enriched by his experience.				 										B. M. Varma (ex-chief): Its a very big loss to the club. To replace him will be a Herculean task as there is a shortage of talented administrator in the racing industry. RCTC needed his services badly in the crisis time.				 										N. M. Ghose (ex-chief): He was sitting on a volcano. Frankly, a man of his talent, commitment and character had no future in RCTC. He would have remained stagnant in RCTC. Full credit goes to him for bringing down the state governments debt to Rs 8 crore. He is a creator and a leader. In a limited playground he has managed to achieve a lot.				 										Satish Kapoor: The club has lost gem of a man and administrator. Its a great loss to the racing industry as well. I have interacted with many secretaries of various clubs, he was by far the best.				 										B. M. Khaitan, the ex-patron of RCTC was out to attend a wedding, said the family sources thus he was not available for comments.

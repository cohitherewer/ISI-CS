The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McGrath out of last 2 Tests too
 Glenn McGrath Sydney: Australia, who suffered a rare Test defeat to India on home soil on Tuesday, were dealt yet another blow when pace spearhead Glenn McGrath was ruled out of the remainder of the four-Test series. McGraths repaired left ankle has failed to heal completely after two operations to remove bone spurs and he would not play in what was his expected Pura Cup comeback game for New South Wales (NSW) against Tasmania on Friday in Sydney. A concerned McGrath cancelled a session in the SCG nets on Tuesday afternoon after experiencing continuous pain in his ankle. He met with NSW team physiotherapist Pat Farhart later in the day after which the duo agreed a more realistic return date would be their Pura Cup clash against Victoria in Newcastle on January 9. It has not settled, it is still swelling up, Farhart said of McGraths injured ankle. The paceman has not played since pulling out on the eve of the Zimbabwe series in October. Australias fast bowling department was in dire straits as they went down to India. Brad Williams, who damaged his left shoulder while fielding, just about managed to bowl in Indias second innings. Jason Gillespie was forced to leave the field with a groin injury and remains in doubt for the next Test.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

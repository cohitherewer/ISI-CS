(AFP) London, Feb. 1 (Reuters): Manchester United kept the pressure on Arsenal at the top of the English Premier League on Saturday when they won 2-0 at Southampton while Arsenal needed a last-minute goal to beat Fulham 2-1 at Highbury. Arsenal bounced back from the disappointment of conceding a last-minute goal at Liverpool on Wednesday to beat Fulham thanks to a stoppage-time winner from Robert Pires, who had also put the champions ahead early in the game. Arsenal moved on to 56 points from 26 matches  six clear of United who have a game in hand. United moved back into second place above non-playing Newcastle following their win at Southampton, their fifth successive league victory. Newcastle slipped back to third place with 48 points from their 25 matches as their Tyne-Tees derby match at Middlesbrough was postponed, while Chelsea stayed fourth after being held to a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge by Tottenham. At the bottom, Darren Moore gave West Bromwich Albion a 2-1 victory at Manchester City which lifted them off the bottom of the table. Sunderland are now last after losing 1-3 at home to Charlton whose tally included two Michael Proctor own-goals. United kept up their relentless challenge with a convincing victory at St Marys  the first time United have kept a clean-sheet away from home this season. Ruud Van Nistelrooy scored his 25th goal of the season after 15 minutes when he rifled the ball into the roof of the net, and United had the game as good as won seven minutes later when Ryan Giggs scored on his second attempt after Claus Lundekvam blocked his first shot.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 End of Indian challenge
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Naoki Arimoto, the unseeded Japanese who beat Vijay Kannan to signal the end of the Indian challenge, at the BTA Complex Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Lone Indian hope Vijay Kannan crashed out of the ITF Futures mens tennis tournament at the BTA Complex Thursday. He went down 0-6, 6-3, 4-6 to Japanese Naoki Arimoto in one hour and 52 minutes. Kannan could not pose any challenge to the rampaging Japanese qualifier as he walked through the first set. But the Indian fought back, breaking Arimonto in the first game of the second set. Kannan broke him in the seventh and ninth games as well to wrap up the set. However, Kannan could not keep up the good work in the decider. He was broken in the fifth game and Arimoto, after surviving a few anxious moments in the last game, served out to secure a place in the last four. Dutch top seed Fred Hemmes conceded his match to Alessandro da Col of Italy with the players locked one-set all. Hemmes started off well by winning the first set 6-4, but after sustaining a knee injury, he could not carry on after losing the second set in tie-breaker. Also making the semi-finals are Zbynek Mlynarik of Austria, who beat Jasper Smith of The Netherlands 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 and Marcel Felder of Uruguay, who thrashed Matwee Middelkoop of The Netherlands 6-3, 6-0. Results Singles, quarters: Alessandro Da Col (Ita) bt Fred Hemmes (Ned) 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) (conceded); Zbynek Mlynarik (Aut) bt Jasper Smith (Ned) 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3; Naoki Arimoto (Jpn) bt Vijay Kannan (Ind) 6-0, 3-6, 6-4; Marcel Felder (Uru) bt Matwee Middelkoop (Ned) 6-3, 6-0.

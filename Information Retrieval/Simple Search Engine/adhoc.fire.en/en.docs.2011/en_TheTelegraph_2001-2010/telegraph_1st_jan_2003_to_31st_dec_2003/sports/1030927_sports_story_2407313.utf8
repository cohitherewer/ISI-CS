 Rain spoils Day One 
Visakhapatnam: Rain robbed more than five hours of play on Day I of the three-day match between New Zealand and the Board Presidents XI, as the home side reached 23 for no loss at stumps. Skipper Virender Sehwag and Akash Chopra were on nine, after Sehwag won the toss and elected to bat. The umpires called it a day 44 minutes before the scheduled close, with only 46 minutes of play possible. Earlier, a total of 270 minutes of play at the newly built stadium was lost due to a damp outfield and wet run-up following heavy overnight showers. which continued till early morning on Friday. The groundsmen did a Herculean job putting saw dust and their efforts bore fruit when the umpires finally decided to start play half-an-hour into the post-tea session.  (PTI)  Copyright

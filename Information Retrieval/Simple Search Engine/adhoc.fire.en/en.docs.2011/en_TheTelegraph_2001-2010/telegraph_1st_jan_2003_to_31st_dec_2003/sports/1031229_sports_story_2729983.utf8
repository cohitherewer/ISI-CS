 Ian Butler corners Pak
Wellington: A devastating six-wicket haul by young speedster Ian Butler destroyed the Pakistan first innings and put New Zealand firmly in control of the second Test at the Basin Reserve here on Sunday. Butler, 22, took his last five wickets for just 12 runs as the Pakistan innings folded up for 196 at tea on the third day, in reply to New Zealands first innings 366. At stumps, New Zealand were 75 for three in their second knock, an overall lead of 245 with two days remaining. Playing in only his seventh Test, Butler produced a withering spell with the second new ball as Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 28 runs, and their last four wickets for only two runs. Pakistan had started the day with intentions of batting their way to safety and from a slow start had reached 134 for four at lunch. Yousuf Youhana, who struggled early in his innings, gained in confidence after the lunch session and moved to 60 in 246 minutes at the crease before popping a simple catch to Stephen Fleming off Daniel Vettori and Pakistan were 168 for five. Enter butler. Charging into the northerly wind, he bowled Abdul Razzaq for 26 to make it 171 for six. Mohammad Sami was caught behind, Shoaib Akhtar was bowled and Moin Khan was caught.

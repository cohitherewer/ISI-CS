The Telegraph - Calcutta
 In certain areas the role of a coach has got diminished, says Simpson
 - Aussie guru feels he alone should have been in control of the Indian team during the 1999 World Cup  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Bobby Simpson feels Gaekwad should have been made his deputy Melbourne: An outstanding batsman, good captain and inspirational coach... Bobby Simpson has had an excellent innings and, even today, continues to travel as consultant. Though based in Sydney, Simpson keeps turning up here and there. The other day, he spoke to The Telegraph, almost exclusively on coaching. The following are excerpts Q Theres been quite a change from the time you were coach (for a decade from 1986)...Now, there are specialist batting, bowling and fielding coaches to help the main guy... A (Grins) Does seem there are too many people in the dressing room... Having said that, its fair if the coach needs specialists... I suppose thats the way the world is going... Having more and more people for one job. On tours, however, Im sure its hard carrying so many hands... (After a pause) In certain areas, the role of a coach has got diminished, something Im not happy about. I ran the show alone and we did pretty well. Why is the coachs position being allowed to get diluted? The people who (also) appoint specialists dont see it that way... If a coach is confident about doing everything on his own, he should. Bottomline is how one feels about specialists. But, equally, one person should be relating to the players. Youve supported Bruce Reids tie-up with India... I have... Youve got quite a few left-arm quicks and Bruce, Im sure, has identified the problem areas. After all, he was himself a quality left-armer. Its a pity a bad back finished his career prematurely. But, honestly, how much of a difference can specialist coaches make at the highest level? Look, a good coach can quickly spot the little things which do make a difference. For example, a bowling coach may alter the angle of the wrist somewhat and it could help... Obviously, at the Test level, no coach can afford to call for a major change. Did you, at any time, seek specialist help? Dennis Lillee had an invitation to come whenever he liked... I didnt have a problem requesting somebody whom I respected to have a word or two... Actually, I found Alec Bedser a big help... What are your impressions of John Buchanan? Hes more a manager, a very good organiser... Thats how his role is perceived within the team too... It was different when I took charge, as we were an ordinary side... My role, therefore, necessarily had to be different. Its not been the same with John, who got a ready-made team (in late 1999). How did you transform Australia? It was a long process, like a jigsaw puzzle... I began with a nucleus of five  Allan Border, Craig McDermott, Geoff Marsh, David Boon and Steve Waugh  with Dean Jones being quickly added... Initially, I aimed at each player improving by five per cent... We moved on from there. Seven years on, is it a regret that your contract wasnt renewed (after the 1996 World Cup)? No... In any case, I would have gone out within 12 months after the final... That was being discussed and Id suggested Geoff (Marsh) be appointed my deputy in that period... As it turned out, I was on vacation (in Italy) when I heard Geoff had straightaway been named my successor... It would have been easier on Geoff had he worked with me for a year... Indeed, its not easy coaching the guys youve played with. Marsh, though, also went on to win the (1999) World Cup... Yes, but if I may point out, the success of both a captain and coach is determined by the quality of the players... No matter how good a coach or captain, you cant win with a bad team. In a nutshell, what is a coach supposed to do? Simply, all the work till the captain takes his team out to the park... On the strategy bit, I think the captain and coach have to be one... That way, the execution will be neater. If one has strong feelings, its best to argue them out. Are you pleased with the way Sourav Ganguly has grown into the captaincy? Hes improved, hes got better ... However, he should bowl a lot more. Once he does, the team will have balance and picking two spinners overseas wont be an issue. What qualities do you look for in a captain? Consistency, tolerance and decisiveness. And, of course, enthusiasm. Actually, the coach and captain must be the two most enthusiastic in the squad. Did Indias Adelaide performance surprise you? Not at all, because once they took control, they grew stronger and stronger... After the first two days, India never looked back. You were the Indian teams consultant in the lead-up to and during the 1999 World Cup, where we didnt move beyond the Super Six. I assume you would have preferred a bigger role... (Grins again) In retrospect, I should have been in control... One person alone ought to have been answerable... Did you have a problem with the then coach, Aunshuman Gaekwad? We got along well But, because he was the coach, I didnt... As Ive said, with the benefit of hindsight, it would have been more productive had he been my deputy. Have you been keeping track of John Wrights progress? Hes done very well... Theres so much diversity in India, the situation gets political... The last question: Youre regarded as the guru among coaches... (Laughs) Ive never looked for a label... Ive just been a committed and simple coach.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inter have score to settle
 - MILAN DERBY - Cupers side fired up after Vieri return  Christian Vieri and Filippo Inzaghi, seen celebrating a goal for Italy, will be up against each other in the crucial derby between Inter Milan and AC Milan on Sunday Milan: Inter Milan will try to avenge last seasons Champions League semi-final defeat by AC Milan when they face their city rivals on Sunday in Serie A. AC Milan went on to be crowned European champions following an away-goals semi-final win over Inter in May after two closely contested matches at the San Siro stadium shared by the two clubs. Inter also lost both of last seasons league derby games 1-0 and have not beaten Milan at home since an Italian Cup match in January 1998. But Inters Argentine captain Javier Zanetti is convinced his team is made of sterner stuff this season. We are stronger because we are a more complete side, said Zanetti, whose team is fifth on eight points, two less than joint leaders AC Milan, after four games. We have more choices available to us and we have two players for each role. Believe me we have a group of lads here who will get excellent results. There is a cohesion that I havent seen before and that is fundamental, he added. While the fixture arrives unusually early in the Serie A season, the pressure is on Inter to pick up three points after successive draws against Sampdoria and Udinese. Hector Cupers side is boosted by the return of Christian Vieri to their attack  the Italy striker marked his comeback from three weeks out with a calf injury by grabbing the last-minute winner in Tuesdays 2-1 Champions League win over Dynamo Kiev. But they will again be without central defender Marco Materazzi with former Fiorentina stopper Daniele Adani expected to stand in as Inter look to keep a fifth consecutive clean sheet. AC Milan have striker Filippo Inzaghi back to full fitness and is expected to partner Andriy Shevchenko in attack with Ancelotti facing his usual dilemma over whom to select as his attacking midfielder. Brazilian Kaka was one of several players below par in Milans goalless draw at Celta Vigo in the Champions League on Wednesday but he could be given the nod ahead of Portugals Rui Costa. Rivaldo, who was poised to leave Milan last week, is expected to be on the bench having got half an hour under his belt in Spain.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

Jodha-trainee in the 1,000 Gu-ineas as the company in that was a bit too tough for him to tackle. Now that he is back to his own class, the White Crown-Pas Plouc filly may win in the hands of P. Belose.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2.30 pm: Snow Star 1. Scamster 2. Open Season 3.				 										3 pm: Special Place 1. Santarelle 2.

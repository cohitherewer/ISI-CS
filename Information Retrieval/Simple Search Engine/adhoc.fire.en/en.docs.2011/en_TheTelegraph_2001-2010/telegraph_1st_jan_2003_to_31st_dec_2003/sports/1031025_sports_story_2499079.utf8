The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Test series unlikely before Olympics
Hyderabad: Despite the governments green signal to resume bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan, India may not immediately play a Test series with their arch-rivals due to a packed schedule, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) secretary K. Jothikumaran said here Friday. I got an invitation from The Netherlands Hockey Federation two days back and have given the confirmation since the best teams are in the fray, Jothikumaran said about the four-nation tournament in June-July next year. We will also be playing a four-nation tournament in Australia in April. So it is very difficult to accommodate a Test series between India and Pakistan till the completion of the Olympics next year, he said. The two teams have not met in a Test series since 1999. The tournament in Australia, to be played in the second week of April, will feature India, Pakistan, Argentina and the hosts. The championship in The Netherlands, between June 25 and July 5, will see Australia, India, Pakistan and the hosts.  (PTI)  Copyright

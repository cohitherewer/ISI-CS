The Telegraph - Calcutta
 5-0 sweep for Pak 
 Inzamam-ul-Haq hits a boundary off Rajin Saleh during Pakistans final ODI against Bangladesh in Karachi on Sunday. (AFP) Karachi: Pakistan cruised to a 58-run victory in the final one-dayer against Bangladesh on Sunday to complete a 5-0 whitewash of the five-match series. The Pakistan players wore black armbands to mark their protest against South Africas decision to call off their tour later this month due to security fears. Bangladesh were always facing a tall order after a fluent 82 from opener Yasir Hameed helped Pakistan reach 302 for five. Even though the Bangladesh top order struck form together for the first time in the series with valuable contributions from Hannan Sarkar (50), Rajin Saleh (71) and Alok Kapali (69), the target always appeared to be beyond their reach. The visitors finished on 244 for seven. Pakistans Yousuf Youhana reached a personal landmark when he reached 5000 runs by scoring a quickfire 52 from just 32 balls. He became the seventh Pakistani after Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar, Salim Malik, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Rameez Raja and Ijaz Ahmed to reach the mark. The team dedicated the 5-0 sweep to their regular captain Rashid Latif, who missed the series following the five-match imposed on him.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

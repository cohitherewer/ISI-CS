The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lee too ruled out of tri-series 
 Lee has a torn stomach muscle Sydney, Oct. 18 (Agencies): Brett Lee was ruled out of the forthcoming tour of India after injuring himself while bowling during the second Test against Zimbabwe on Saturday. He will take no further part in the remainder of the Test. The Australian fast bowler was forced to leave the field following his third over of the day and was later diagnosed with a torn stomach muscle. I am bitterly disappointed. Ive worked really hard on my fitness and have basically gone through the past three seasons unscathed, so to miss this tour now is a major blow, Lee said. I pretty much knew from my first ball this morning that something was wrong. But hopefully weve identified the problem early and it wont turn into a bigger problem. His replacementwill be announced soon. Veteren Queenslander Michael Kasprowicz will lead a handful of probables, whose fate will be decided by the four-member selection committee led by Trevor Hohns on Sunday.  Copyright

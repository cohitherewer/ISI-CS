The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We must continue to apply ourselves, says Sehwag
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Chris CairnsChandigarh, Oct.18: Not too long ago, Virender Sehwag told The Telegraph that he lives in the present. Well, today, he made the most of his nearly five-hour stay at the PCA Stadium in Mohali. Unbeaten on 128, Sehwag said the fourth morning alone would determine just how far he (and Team India) would go in the second (and deciding) Test. Our aim, of course, is to first avert the follow-on. We must continue to apply ourselves, he pointed out. Sehwag, mind you, didnt forget to compliment opening mate (and fellow Delhiite) Akash Chopra. Technically, hes very good and, obviously, its a help that both of us have played together for Delhi... Meanwhile, hot shot New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns, who has joined the team ahead of the tri-series, admitted that he wasnt sure of a place in the first XI. The guys have done so well, in the Tests, that Im not sure whether Ill make it... Never before have I felt like this... Cairns, it may be recalled, made himself unavailable for the two Tests as his wife was expecting their second baby (a boy). Looking ahead to the tri-series, he commented: Australia and India are favoured to make the (November 18) final, but with key bowlers missing in both teams, we do have a good chance...  Copyright

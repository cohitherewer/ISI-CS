The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Junior annual meet mooted
Karachi: Pakistan and India will attempt to break the ice in their cricket relations by playing in an annual triangular one-day tournament at junior level. The decision to take part in junior tournaments from February 2004 was taken at a meeting of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) in London. These competitions should help India and Pakistan to break the ice and resume cricket against each other on a more regular basis, Pakistan cricket board (PCB) chairman Tauqir Zia said in a statement. The third team in the tournament will be Sri Lanka. This is a positive move and decision at the ACC level. Such competitions will also help promote the game in the region at the grassroot level, Zia added. The Indian government has not allowed its team to play bilateral cricket matches against Pakistan at any level since 2000. India last visited Pakistan for a full Test series in 1988-89, while Pakistans last tour of India was in 1999.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

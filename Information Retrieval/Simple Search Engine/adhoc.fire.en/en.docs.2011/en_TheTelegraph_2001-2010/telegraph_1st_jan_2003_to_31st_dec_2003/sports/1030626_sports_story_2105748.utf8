 Surya suffers defeat in fourth round
Nakhchivan (Azerbaijan): Surya Sekhar Ganguly failed to keep his momentum going and went down to Kadir Guseinov of Azerbaijan in the fourth round of the World Junior Chess Championships Wednesday. It turned out to be a disappointing day for the Indian boys. IM P. Magesh Chandran and national junior champion Abhijit Gupta also lost, against Kritz Leonid of Germany and Sergei Azarov of Belarus, respectively. GM P. Harikrishna, who suffered a rather uncharacteristic loss to Abhijit in the second round, scored his second successive victory and moved to 2.5 points, half-a-point behind Ganguly. Marcin Dziuba of Poland, Leonid and Guseinov, all with 3.5 points apiece, shared the lead. A pack of eight players, including Ganguly, followed them on three points each. Magesh and Harikrishna were in the next lot, comprising nine players. Abhijit, national sub-junior champion S. Arun Prasad and Asian junior champion Deepan Chakravarthy have two points each. In the girls section, Indias youngest WIM Dronavalli Harika gave yet another emphatic display of her positional acumen but missed out on a victory and settled for truce with compatriot and Asian junior champion Tania Sachdev. Harika lost her joint lead after the deadlock and is now in joint third position with Shahna Agaeva of Azerbaijan, having amassed 2.5 points from three rounds. Top-seeded Georgian Nana Dzagnidze and Romanian Cristina Calotescu shared the lead in the girls section with a 100 per cent score of three points. Ganguly was unlucky and lost from a level position. It was a Sicilian Defence where the Indian played black and neutralised after tackling some tricks effectively. Ganguly failed to find the right defence and lost after 63 moves. The queens got traded in the middle game and Ganguly won a pawn in the ensuing rooks and pawns endgame. Guseinov got his share of counterplay on the King side where he obtained dangerous looking passed pawns and advanced it unchecked till Ganguly fumbled in finding the right defence. Magesh Chandrans excursion in a French defence with black pieces was a short and sweet affair, albeit from his opponents perspective. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 Moya highest seed to fall, Anna humiliated
				 	 Second seed Andre Agassi in action against Lee Hyung-Taik in Melbourne Wednesday. Agassi swept past Lee 6-1, 6-0, 6-0. (AFP)																								Melbourne: Businesslike and in a hurry, Andre Agassi stopped South Korean Lee Hyung-taik dead in his tracks on Wednesday with a 6-1, 6-0, 6-0 Australian Open thrashing.																								After winning the opening game of the match, Lee lost the next 18 as seven times Grand Slam winner Agassi romped to an 80-minute victory. Agassi faces Frances Nicolas Escude next.																								Fifth seed Carlos Moya became the highest-ranked casualty in the mens draw after he was beaten 6-3, 6-7, 4-6, 6-4, 2-6 by Mardy Fish in the second round.																								The Spaniard, runner-up in Melbourne to Pete Sampras in 1997, lost to Fish for the second time in eight days. Moya suffered the same fate in the second round of the Sydney International last week.																								Moya has now failed to make it past the third round in his last seven Grand Slam appearances.																								Mark Philippoussis twice fought back from a set down to upset 11th seed Paradorn Srichaphan 3-6, 6-1, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3.																								The big-serving Australian looked to be in trouble after Paradorn led by two sets to one but he managed to break the Thais serve once on each of the final two sets to seal victory.																								That was a big win for me, Philippoussis said. I just hung there in and kept fighting all the way and it paid off.																								Paradorn went into the match as a slight favourite after winning the recent Indian Open. He said: Of course Im a little disappointed but it was a great match and he played really well.																								Philippoussis next plays Sargis Sargsian after the Armenian beat 17th seed Gaston Gaudio of Argentina 2-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-2. 																								Lindsay Davenport was hustled and harried all the way on Wednesday before finally overcoming Iroda Tulyaganova 6-7, 6-4, 7-5 to reach the third round.																								Second seed Venus Williams thrashed qualifier Ansley Cargill 6-3, 6-0. She plays Anca Barna in the third round after the German upset 27th seed Lisa Raymond 6-3, 6-1.																								Davenport struggled to find any consistency throughout but in the end did just enough against the feisty Uzbek. Relieved, she let out a screech of delight after whipping a forehand crosscourt past the 57th-ranked Tulyaganova to finally bury her tenacious opponent. Seeded ninth this year, the former world No.1 will next face Tatiana Panova of Russia.																								Anna Kournikova also suffered humiliation, falling to the heaviest Slam defeat of her eight-year career.																								The Russian was destroyed 0-6, 1-6 by fifth-seeded Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne. She rushed from the court immediately after her 48-minute ordeal ended, red-faced and clearly upset by the one-sided humiliation.																								More than an hour later, make-up reapplied and wearing a black tracksuit top and black cap, Kournikova put a brave face: We were both on the court...I think it was a match.																								Her previous worst showing at a Grand Slam was when she lost 2-6, 1-6 to Steffi Graf in the fourth round of the 1996 US Open. 																								Alexandra Stevensons appalling Grand Slam run continued when the 15th seed lost 2-6, 1-6 6-2 to Czech Denisa Chladkova.																								Since going through to the semi-finals of Wimbledon on her debut in 1999, the American has lost in the first round of 10 Grand Slams and in the second round a further three times. She added another second-round loss to that record as she threw in 33 unforced errors in a bad-tempered match against Chladkova.																								Seventh seed Daniela Hantuchova edged past Italian Adriana Serra Zanetti 7-6, 7-6 to reach the third round and a clash with Samantha Stosur, but former mens champion Yevgeny Kafelnikovs campaign ended in Round II.																								The 1999 winner and runner-up a year later, the former World No. 1 from Russia ran out of fuel after clawing his way back from two sets down, losing to Finn Jarkko Nieminen 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1, 1-6.																								Fourth seed Juan Carlos Ferrero reached the third round with a 6-0, 6-4, 6-2 win over Frances Jean- Rene Lisnard while French Open champion and eighth seed Albert Costa ended Australian Scott Drapers hopes 6-4, 6-7, 6-2, 6-3.

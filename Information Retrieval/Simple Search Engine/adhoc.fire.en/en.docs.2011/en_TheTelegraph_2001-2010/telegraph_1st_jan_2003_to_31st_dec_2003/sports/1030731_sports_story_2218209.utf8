 Prakash scalps Safin - Amritraj Jr Indian No. 1 after Russian  star retires with injury
 Prakash should soon  be getting into the India Davis Cup team  Los Angeles: Prakash Amritraj  scalped former US Open champion Marat Safin in the first  round of the Mercedes-Benz Cup on Tuesday, reports Reuters. The Russians comeback from injury  was short-lived as he was forced to retire in the closing  stages of the first set with the Indian serving to wrap  it up at 5-3. Sixth-seeded Safin, who has been  out of action since April with a left wrist injury, was  clearly in discomfort from the start of his match against  the elder son of former Indian star Vijay Amritraj and finally  threw in the towel after close to half an hour. Having first picked up the injury  during Januarys Australian Open, Safin indicated this latest  setback could stop him from playing the rest of the year. I got injured, I felt a lot of  pain in my wrist, I could not hit a backhand so I decided  to stop, said a dejected Safin. Ahead of Bopanna  A Staff Reporter in Calcutta  adds: The upset over Safin gave Prakash 15 points which  takes his tally to 96 and will push his ATP ranking from  351 to around 315. More significantly, it will make him  the highest-ranked Indian  taking him past Rohan Bopanna. Bopanna lost in the first round  of the Denver Challenger on Tuesday, thus failing to add  to his kitty (95 points). His ranking will stay around world  No. 320. Harsh Mankad, who won his first match in Denver,  is currently No. 364. Prakash is still based in the  US but has been entering tournaments as an Indian since  turning pro in May. He is eligible to play for India in  Davis Cup and should be in Ramesh Krishnans team to take  on The Netherlands in Septembers away World Group play-off  tie. Prakash won a round at last weeks  RCA Championships too, mastering Argentine Sergio Roitman  (world No. 140) in three sets before su ccumbing to German  Nicolas Kiefer in straight sets. Last month, he won three  back-to-back ITF Satellite titles in India last month. Copyright

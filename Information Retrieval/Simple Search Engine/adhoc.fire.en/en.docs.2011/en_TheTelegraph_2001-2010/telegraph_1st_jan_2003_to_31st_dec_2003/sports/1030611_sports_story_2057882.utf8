				 																																																	 Six US coaches arrived in the city Tuesday on a goodwill tour to offer tips to state basketball players. The coaches, four of them are brothers, are associated with the Satellite Sports Club. 				 																																																	Scott Schramm, Darrin Schramm, Josh Schramm, Marty Schramm, Preston Jarrel and Brooke Eversmeyer were on vacation in India when West Bengal Basketball Association got in touch with them. 				 																																																	They agreed to undergo a coaching camp, which started Tuesday, for a week. About 90 boys and girls from the city schools and local clubs as well as trainees from NIS Salt Lake are taking part in it. 				 																																																	A week is not a long enough time to assess the merits and demerits of the players here, but our general impression is that these guys are quite keen to learn, said Schott Schramm. 				 																																																	 Subrata Sarkar will get the best referees award, to be introduced by the IFA at its annual prize distribution ceremony at the Mahajati Sadan Friday. AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi will be the chief guest of the evening.

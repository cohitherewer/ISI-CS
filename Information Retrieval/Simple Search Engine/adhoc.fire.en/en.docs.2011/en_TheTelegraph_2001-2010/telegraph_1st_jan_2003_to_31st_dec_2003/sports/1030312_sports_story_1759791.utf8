 Pycroft resigns
Bloemfontein: Zimbabwe cricket selector Andy Pycroft has resigned on the eve of the teams key Super Six match against Kenya. He sent in a letter of resignation today, and I have passed it on to (ZCU president) Peter Chingoka, Vince Hogg, the managing director of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, said by phone from Harare on Tuesday. He has a difference of opinion with the other selectors and he also cited a lack of communication with them. The teams Cup campaign has been dogged with controversy. England forfeited their match against Zimbabwe in Harare over security concerns while Andy Flower and Henry Olonga began the World Cup by wearing black armbands to protest against President Robert Mugabes government and what they saw as human rights abuses in the country. Olonga has not been selected since.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

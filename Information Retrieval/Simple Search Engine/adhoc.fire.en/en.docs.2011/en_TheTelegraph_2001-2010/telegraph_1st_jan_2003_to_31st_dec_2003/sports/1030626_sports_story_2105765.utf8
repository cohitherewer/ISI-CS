The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kaif knock not enough
London: A superb 53 by Mohammed Kaif for Derbyshire went in vain as Leicestershire won by a run in a nail-biting Twenty20 Cup match Tuesday. With two points from this victory, Leicestershire earned a place in the final to be played next month. Leicestershire, after winning the toss, scored 171 for eight in 20 overs with Virender Sehwag contributing 15. In reply, Kaif who struck 53, set up a thrilling finish. At Headingley, Yuvraj Singh was lucky. Though he made just nine, Yorkshire won.  (PTI)  Copyright

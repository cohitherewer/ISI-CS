		 Thursday, January 30, 2003 				 Court rejects Azhar plea
				 	 AZHAR: Not on par with Jadeja																								Hyderabad: A city court has rejected former India captain Mohammed Azharuddins plea to appoint an arbitrator on the lines of the Ajay Jadeja case to look into the life ban imposed on him by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. 																								Second Additional Chief Judge M. Vijayalakshmi on Wednesday dismissed Azhars application praying to refer the BCCIs life ban on him to an arbitrator as was done for Jadeja. The judge said there was mutual agreement between Jadeja and the BCCI whereas there was no such agreement between Azhar and the cricket board.																								We will file a review petition. Its one option, Azhars lawyer K. Jagdeesh said on Wednesday when asked about the future course of action.																								Azhars lawyer claimed he did not receive a copy of the judgement and said, A decision would be taken after we go through the full text of it but it is logical that we go for a review petition.																								Azharuddin was not immediately available for comment. 																								Azhar had filed his application soon after the Delhi High Court-appointed justice J.K. Mehra as arbitrator in Jadejas case last November.																								Azhar in his petition said since his case was on the same lines as that of Jadeja, the same arbitrator could be appointed to settle the issue.																								Both Azhar and Jadeja were banned on matchfixing charges in December 2000 based on the K.Madhavan Committee report and the two batsmen moved court challenging the ban.  (PTI)

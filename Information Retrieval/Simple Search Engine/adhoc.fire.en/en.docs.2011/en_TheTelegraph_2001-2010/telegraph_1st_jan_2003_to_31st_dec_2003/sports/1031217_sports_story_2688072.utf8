The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia hits injury-time winner
 - National League - Churchill Brothers cry foul after failing to defend early  lead against EB  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Bhaichung Bhutia in action against Churchill Brothers during their National Football League encounter at Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday Calcutta: East Bengals first win in the eighth edition of the National Football League (NFL)  a 2-1 verdict against Churchill Brothers at Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday  could be viewed from different perspectives. If it was a much-needed confidence-booster for the defending champions  a turning point for the team, as coach Subhas Bhowmick put it  they also enjoyed the rub of the green, perhaps for the first time in four games in the ongoing competition. It was a hard-fought win, in that they had to come back from a third-minute shocker from Yusif Yakubu. The equaliser came through new recruit Cristiano Junior, via a spot-kick. The experience of old fox Tushar Rakshit and the expertise of Bhaichung Bhutia also came into focus as much as the teams overall desperation to come out of a bad phase. It was deep into injury time when the mercurial Bhaichung found the matchwinner from a brilliant three-man move. Tushar, who substituted Debjit Ghosh soon after change of ends, delivered a deft through for Suley Musah on the right. The East Bengal captain ran up about 30 yards before squaring the ball invitingly across the penalty box. Junior missed it, but Bhaichung was on the spot, pushing himself in with the ball. Bhaichung had done precious little earlier in the match, but with that goal he literally stole the Goans thunder. Churchill Brothers, always a hard nut to crack, later gheraoed referee S.M. Balu from Karnataka, alleging he had let the ball roll on for some precious extra seconds. But make no mistake, East Bengal returned deserved winners. The beginning, however, was hardly savoury. The home team woke up to a third-minute Mahesh Gawli blunder which handed the visitors the lead. The East Bengal central defender was absolutely free to clear an innocuous Hardip Sangha cross from left, but the formers outrageous clearance gave Yakubu possession just outside the box, with ample space to manoeuvre. The Ghanaian striker entered the box unchallenged and slotted home to the left of custodian Sandip Nandy. East Bengal survived another scare  when Tiken Singhs header off a Yakubu cross kissed the crosspiece  before levelling scores on the stroke of half-time. Junior met with a Subhas Chakraborty floater from the left, but the formers header caught Churchill defender Osumanu Husseinis hand. The Brazilian, whose debut show in a red-and-gold jersey was above-average, converted the resultant penalty. It was all through a pacy, end-to-end match, with East Bengal intent on going for the kill and Churchill relying on counter-attacks. If woodwork came in the way of Tikens 48th-minute attempt, Alvito DCunha met with the same fate nine minutes later. East Bengal enjoyed more of the possession, but they clearly missed injured Douglas da Silvas towering presence in the middle-third. Bhaichungs new role as midfielder hardly produced the desired result and Tushars introduction helped balance the central zone. Despite the handicaps, East Bengal came close to scoring on a number of occasions, but the forwards were easily defeated by the Osumanu-led defence in aerial balls. I hope my boys will get back their confidence from this match. The chance factor clicked for us this may be a turning point for the team, Bhowmick said later. His opposite number Marcus Pacheco pulled up the referee for biased supervision in favour of the home team. His (the referees) decision of awarding a penalty against us was also dreadful... Osumanus handling of the ball was clearly unintentional, Pacheco said of East Bengals equaliser.  Teams  East Bengal: Sandip Nandy; Suley  Musah, Mahesh Gawli, M.

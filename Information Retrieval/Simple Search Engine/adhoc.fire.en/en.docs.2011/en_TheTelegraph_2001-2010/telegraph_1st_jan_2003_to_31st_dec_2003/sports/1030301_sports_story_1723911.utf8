The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inzy to SoS Richards
 INZAMAM: Not lacking in confidence Centurion: Out-of-form Pakistani batsman Inzamam-ul Haq on Friday revealed he was going to speak to West Indian legend Vivian Richards in a bid to get back among the runs at the World Cup. I have never faced such a situation before. I want to call my idol Vivian Richards to sort out the problem, Inzamam said. Richards is currently in South Africa as head of the West Indies selectors, but Inzamam was unaware whether he will come to watch Saturdays high-profile clash between India and Pakistan at SuperSport Park. I have no clue where my form has gone but the confidence is there, the 32-year-old said. My father phoned me from Pakistan and advised me not to lose faith and has prayed for my success against India. I have always followed my fathers advice and have succeeded. Inzamam, who shed 23 pounds to get fit for the World Cup, appears to have lost his appetite for runs as well, struggling to make 10 runs in four matches. But his teammates were backing him to come good soon. I called my old friend Mushtaq Ahmed (former Pakistan spinner) and spoke to Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram, he said. All of them told me that there was nothing wrong and runs would come in the next game. I have never worked so hard as I did before the World Cup and it is quite strange I am not being able to deliver. Inzamams tally of 8,949 runs in 288 one-day matches is the fourth highest behind Sachin Tendulkar, Mohammad Azharuddin and Sri Lankas Aravinda de Silva. Inzamam has never scored a World Cup century, his highest being 81 against Australia four years ago, and Inzamam hoped the record will be set right against India. I am sure a century is just around the corner and if it comes against India, I will be the happiest man.  (AFP)  Copyright

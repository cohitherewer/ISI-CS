 ICC not to charge Flower, Olonga
Johannesburg: The ICC decided on Friday not to charge Zimbabwe players Andy Flower and Henry Olonga with bringing the game into disrepute during a World Cup game in Harare. Former skipper Flower and pace bowler Olonga spoke out against President Robert Mugabes government and its human rights record moments before Zimbabwes opener against Namibia at Harare Sports Club on Monday. Both players also wore black armbands during the match and said they would sport them throughout the Cup. The ICCs tournament technical committee said it had considered the matter after the Zimbabwe Cricket Union argued that the actions of the players had brought the game into disrepute. The ICC said it was up to the ZCU to take further action if it felt that the players had broken their contracts. (Reuters)  Copyright

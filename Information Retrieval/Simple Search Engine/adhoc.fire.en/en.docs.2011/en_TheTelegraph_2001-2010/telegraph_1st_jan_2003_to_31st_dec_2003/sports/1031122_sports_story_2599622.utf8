The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We have to lift our game, says Sourav
Chennai: Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly has told his teammates it is imperative for each of them to lift their game and make amends for past failures in order to succeed in Australia. It is going to be a tough and challenging tour. Each one of us will have to lift our game to win matches there, Sourav said before the teams departure on Friday. India will play four Tests and a tri-series Down Under. Everybody will have to lift his game including myself. We will have to fight and perform well, the captain said. He felt the task at hand was very challenging but the team was hoping to do well. Each tour of Australia by any country is challenging. Australians are very good at home. It is a similar situation when they visit India. It is not going to be any different. But we expect to do well considering the fact that our team has been batting and bowling well for some time now. The Indian skipper, who missed the major part of the recent tri-series including the final, said he is fit now and there is no injury worry over any other player of the team. We are all fit. I got back for two one-day games in Bangalore and Hyderabad but missed the final. To be honest, I have been playing well since the start of the season, he said. Asked about the strategy the team would employ, Sourav said: It is too early to say anything. We have just finished one series and on to another now. It is difficult for me to say at this juncture how the wickets and conditions will be in Australia. Coach John Wright said the team is focussed on its sole objective  win the series against the world champions. We are going on the tour with the hope to win matches and the series. We have the potential to do that.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC holds back Indias Cup dues
 Ehsan Mani rules out immediate payment New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is to freeze payments of millions of dollars to teams involved in this years World Cup. ICC president Ehsan Mani said on Friday the decision was made at the world bodys executive board meeting in Barbados. [However, earlier in the day, the BCCI sources had strongly indicated that the executive board of the IDI Limited had agreed to release the entire amount ($6.5 million), which has been held back from India. The BCCI president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, could not be contacted by The Telegraph till late at night as he was travelling from Barbados to the US.] There will be no immediate release of any money to any country, Mani said in Barbados. He said a total of $36 million had been held back from the teams that competed at the World Cup. He said the ICC had frozen the payments because the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), the ICCs commercial partner for the February-March tournament in South Africa, was demanding around $50 million to compensate for loss of earnings at the event. Mani said any final disbursement would have to wait until the dispute with the GCC was sorted out, which he said will take many, many months. Mani and ICC spokesman Brendon McClements said the ICC was consulting its advisors, and also examining legal issues, as to whether it can release some of the withheld money to the national boards. Any money to be released would be done only on the basis of an undertaking, or in some cases a bank guarantee, but this would be done only if our advisors feel it would be appropriate. The ICC is taking legal advice to assess, to see whether it would be prudent to release money and how much money, they said. The GCC claim follows Indian players insisting on altered contracts to protect personal sponsorship deals. The ICC is also withholding money from New Zealand and England for boycotting matches. New Zealand refused to travel to Kenya and England pulled out of a match in Zimbabwe, both citing security fears. (Reuters)  Copyright

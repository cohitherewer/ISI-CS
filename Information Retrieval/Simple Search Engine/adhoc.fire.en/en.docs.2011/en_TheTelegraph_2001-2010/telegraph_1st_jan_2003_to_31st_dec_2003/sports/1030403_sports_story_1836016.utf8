For me it is a fresh challenge and a new chapter in my career. The aim is for Hampshire to gain promotion in both competitions this year and I hope to be able to play a part in that ambition.				 																																	Bogota: The Colombian soccer league has banned players from lifting their jerseys to celebrate scoring goals.				 																																	Many players lift their shirts after scoring to expose undershirts with messages to their mothers, their girlfriends and god.				 																																	But sponsors complained that the players were obscuring the ads on their jerseys at the most important moment  when television cameras are most focused on the players.				 																																	The measure was indispensable, said Luis Bedoya, president of Dimayor, the professional Colombian league. There were lots of complaints by the sponsors. Dimayor said it will fine players the equivalent of $ 572 for violating the ban.

I have many projects in TV, in radio and other things, but my project at the beginning will be the national team coach of Ghana, the 34-year-old told Chelsea TV. I would like to give back all the experience that I have. I am sitting the diploma to become a manager but I will rest a bit for a few years when I finish because soccer takes a lot out of you.

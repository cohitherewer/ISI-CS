The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sangeetha sole leader
Kozhikode: M. R. Sangeetha of Tamil Nadu emerged the sole leader with 5.5 points after the sixth round of the 30th womens national B chess championship Tuesday. Behind her with five points are Koneru Chandrahasa, Bhagyashree Thipsay, Anupama Gokhale and Sreeparna Chakraborty. Sangeetha made a centre-counter opening to defeat last years under-16 champion Vinuthana in 38 moves. I now need a couple of more wins from the three remaining games to win the title, the 32nd seed said. However, one more win will ensure her a berth in the national A championship. In other games, Koneru and Bhagyashree split points as also Anupama and Sreeparna. Bhagyashree and Anupama have better progressive scores with four consecutive wins and two draws. Asian youth chess India will field their strongest ever 90-member contingent in the Asian youth chess championship to start here Friday.  (PTI)  Copyright

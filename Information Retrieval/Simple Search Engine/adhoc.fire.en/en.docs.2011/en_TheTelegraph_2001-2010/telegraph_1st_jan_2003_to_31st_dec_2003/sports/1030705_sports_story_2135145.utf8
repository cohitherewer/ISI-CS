The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Reals real position not known
Madrid: Real Madrids expansion into Asian markets could bring in 40 million euros ($ 45.84 million) in extra income in the first three years of a new partnership with a sports marketing company, the club said Friday. [A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: This news follows a so far aborted attempt by a Calcutta-based organisation to bring the club to India. India, though remains, on the clubs calendar.] Real said they were guaranteed a minimum of 22 million euros ($ 25.21 million) over the first half of a six-year agreement signed with Asia Sports Development (ASD) to manage the Real Madrid brand in Asia and Oceania. The Real squad, including newly-signed England captain David Beckham, will embark on a four-match pre-season tour of Asia later this month to strengthen their presence in what they see as the key emerging market. Beckham enjoys immense personal popularity in Asia, as demonstrated on his recent promotional tour of the region, but the club said their plans for expansion had been in place long before the England captain was signed up. The tour was organised in February, when the Beckham signing was not on the horizon, Reals marketing chief Jose Angel Sanchez said at a news conference Friday. He added: This agreement is unprecedented in sports marketing. We hope it will bring in 40 million euros over the first three years. As well as the tour, which takes in matches in Beijing, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, the agreement will see Real Madrid and ASD manage official club shops, restaurants and coffee shops. Real Madrid football schools will also be opened, with the first scheduled for Shanghai, and ASD will develop licensed product sales using new technologies. The deal covers China, including Hong Kong and Macao, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Taiwan. Real, arguably the worlds biggest and most successful club, have a separate agreement to exploit their brand in Mexico.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

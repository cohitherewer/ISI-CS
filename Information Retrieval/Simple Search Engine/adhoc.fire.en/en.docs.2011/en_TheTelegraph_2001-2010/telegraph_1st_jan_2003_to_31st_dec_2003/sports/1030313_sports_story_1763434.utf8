		 Thursday, March 13, 2003  Cristopher faces stewards inquiry Romantic Notes shines 
 By star racer 		 Christopher					Calcutta: If apprentice jockey Rutherford Alford hogged the limelight with his well earned rich double though Triumphant and Richie Rich at the RCTC Wednesday, cousin, Cristopher Alford was left to face a stewards inquiry for his listless riding of Assailer in the days opener, the Longtom Handicap. Cristophers handling of the half-money favourite had left many a raised eyebrows thus prompting the stewards to take an unpleasant measure against the leading jockey. A bad fifth till the final turn, when held in an iron grip, the jockey tried to take refuge behind the front-runners along the inside rails as Assailer pulled hard in the stretch-run. Switching the course on the wide when all seemed over, the Vijay Singh-trainee just about managed to place third. The enquiry will be conducted on March 21 thus allowing the jockey some breathing space. Vijays Announcer won the jockey, the Magnanimous Cup, his only winner on the day.				 										Rutherford, in contrast, was all grace as he patiently nursed his slow starter Triumphant (10-1) to post an impressive victory in the Little Bob Handicap.

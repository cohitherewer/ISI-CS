				 																																																	 Mohammedan Sporting have snatch Mohun Bagans international defender Satish Bharti along with goalkeeper Bivash Ghosh. A top official added that the club has also roped in Tollygunge Agragami goalkeeper Amar Deb and Dempo custodian Abhijit Ganguly. Bhartis loss should be a big blow to Mohun Bagan, who suffered badly last season in the absence of quality defenders. On the other hand, Mohammedan Sporting should breathe a little easy now after confirming the goalkeepers since two reliable ones  Prasanta Dora and Imran Khan  have switched over to Mohun Bagan.

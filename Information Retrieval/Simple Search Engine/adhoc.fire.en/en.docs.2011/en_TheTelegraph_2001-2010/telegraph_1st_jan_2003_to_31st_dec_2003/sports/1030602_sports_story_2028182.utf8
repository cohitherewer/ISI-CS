The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Narain targets new laurels
  BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Narain Karthikeyan is on a high these days. Last season the Formula One tracks seemed pretty far off for the fastest Indian. This season the youngster seems to be back in the groove.Narain, who was in Delhi for a couple of days on a promotional tour focussed on the popularity of Formula One, told The Telegraph over phone that he felt confident of now making another series of tests. Narain is so far the only Indian to have tested a Formula One car.I am now third in the World Series of Nissan (formerly known as the Telefonica World Series), he said. Look, last time I had completed with 52 points. This year, with 12 races to go, I am already at 40 points. I feel comfortable I will make a podium finish overall.The Tata Varlin Motorsport Team racer feels that with the new rules in force at Formula One, there could be a few options available for Indians from 2004 (when all the changes are completed), but certainly not before that. The sport, though, still remains reserved for the big-money investor, he said.However, the Formula One tracks look a trifle nearer now, with the changes, he feels .Narain moves to Monza after this week and will have his seventh and eighth races there.

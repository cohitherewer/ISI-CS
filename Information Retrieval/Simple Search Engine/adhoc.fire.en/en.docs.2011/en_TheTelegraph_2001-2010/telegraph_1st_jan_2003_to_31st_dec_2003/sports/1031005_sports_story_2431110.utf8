The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Badani shines on final day as tie ends  in draw
 - 3-DAYER vs NZ - TN batsman scores 127 with fractured hand
 Hemang Badani acknowledges cheers after his century in Rajkot on Saturday Rajkot, Oct. 4 (PTI): Hemang Badani struck a fine century while young Munaf Patel produced another fiery spell as the three-day match between India A and New Zealand ended in a draw on Saturday. Badanis knock of 127 helped the home side take a slender 28-run lead as New Zealand were reduced to 68 for four at stumps at the Corporation Stadium. After Badanis batting exploits, Patel (two for 22), along with Murali Kartik (two for 41), gave New Zealand a scare reducing them to 37 for four in the 12th over before opener Lou Vincent (28 n.o.) and Craig McMillan (17 n.o.) stemmed the rot. First innings centurion Mark Richardson was dismissed early in the second, caught by Rohan Gavaskar at mid-on off Kartik. Richardsons early dismissal saw Nathan Astle promoted to No. 3, but he was trapped leg-before off Patel for five. Skipper Stephen Fleming (3) also failed, becoming Patels second victim. Fleming, who made 27 in the first innings, was snapped by Rohan at point with New Zealand on 34. Three runs later, Kartik dealt another blow having allrounder Scott Styris snicking one to keeper Deep Dasgupta for a duck. With time running out, the home team pressed hard for a few more wickets but Vincent and McMillan played out the remaining 15 overs to force the draw. Earlier, Badani scored a magnificent century to frustrate the Black Caps who toiled hard to prevent India A from taking the lead. Playing with a fractured hand, Badani struck 16 fours and six sixes during his 186-ball knock to become the fourth centurion of the match. Resuming at his overnight score of seven, Badani added 72 with Deep (21). The Tamil Nadu batsman, who was dropped by Paul Wiseman on 81, reached the three- figure mark in style lifting left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori for a six over long-on. Despite the injury, Badani played some superb shots all round the wicket. He played the hook and pull shots against Daryl Tuffey and Jacob Oram with ease after New Zealand took the new ball with the score reading 230 for six. In between, Deep, who provided fine support to Badani, was snapped up brilliantly by Robbie Hart behind the stumps off Tuffey. Earlier, resuming at 216 for four, India A lost Kartik (10), who gave a simple catch to Hart while trying to duck an Oram bouncer. Initially Badani scratched around and found runs hard to come by with his injury restricting his movement. But once he settled down, he looked a lot more comfortable. Rohan (1) did not last long offering a bat-pad catch to forward short leg off a Vettori floater. After losing the two quick wickets, India A struggled to add 48 runs in the morning session. For New Zealand, Vettori and Tuffey took three wickets apiece.  Copyright

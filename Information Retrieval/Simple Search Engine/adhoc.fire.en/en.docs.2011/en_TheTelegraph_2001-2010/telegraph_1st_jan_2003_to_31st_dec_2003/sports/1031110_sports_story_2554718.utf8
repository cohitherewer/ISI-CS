 Juventus take over lead
Milan: Substitute Marco Di Vaio scored two late goals as Italian champions Juventus came from behind for a 4-1 win over Udinese and took over sole control of the top spot in Serie A on Sunday. European champions AC Milan, who began the day level on points with Juventus, were held to a goalless draw at Parma while Inter Milan picked up their second straight win with a comfortable 3-0 home victory over Ancona. Juventus were struggling after Alessandro Del Piero, returning from a seven-week injury lay-off, missed a penalty and Udinese then went ahead with a Marek Jankulovski spot-kick. But the introduction of substitutes Di Vaio and Fabrizio Miccoli turned the game around with Di Vaio equalising in the 79th minute and Miccoli putting Marcello Lippis ahead six minutes later. Di Vaio added his second in the 89th minute and David Trezeuget made it 4-1 in injury time. On Saturday, Cristiano Doni scored one goal and set up another before limping off the field during the first half Sampdoria downed last-place Empoli 2-0.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

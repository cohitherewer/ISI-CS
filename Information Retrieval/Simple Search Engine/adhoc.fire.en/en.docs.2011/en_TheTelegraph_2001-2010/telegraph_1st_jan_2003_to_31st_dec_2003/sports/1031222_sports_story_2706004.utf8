		 Monday, December 22, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	New Delhi: Former India allrounder M.J. Gopalan, who had been the worlds oldest Test cricketer, died in Chennai on Sunday.				 																																	He took one wicket and scored 18 runs in his only Test, which was the second game of the 1933-34 home series against England in Calcutta. He also captained south zone against John Goddard-led West Indians, the first team to visit the country after independence, in 1948-49. Gopalan also played hockey for India with the legendary Dhyan Chand.				 																																	Rye (Australia): World No. 42 Peter Lonard clinched his first Australian Open title when a birdie at the 72nd hole edged out US Open runner-up Stephen Leaney and Chris Downes by one stroke on Sunday.				 																																	The 2002 Australian PGA and Australian Masters winner, Lonard added the national open championship with a stunning approach shot to the par-five 18th that left him with a six-foot putt for birdie.				 																																	London: Chelsea winger Damien Duff will be out of action for at least two weeks after he dislocated his shoulder in the 1-0 premier league victory over west London rivals Fulham on Saturday. I think he will be out for two or three weeks,  Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri told the clubs official website.  Of course, it is a big blow over Christmas because Damien  is Damien. When I dont put him in the squad, my mother  who is 84 years old asks why? She kills me about it, it  is true!

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sampras skips 4th straight meet
Indian Wells: Pete Sampras continued his slew of pullouts on Friday, withdrawing from the Nasdaq-100 Open in Miami just hours after pulling out of next weeks Pacific Life Open. With Sampras deciding to skip the Florida event starting on March 19, he has now withdrawn from four consecutive tournaments. His brother Gus, the tournament director of the Scottsdale Classic in Arizona, said over telephone that he spoke to Pete on Thursday and he still had not made a decision on whether he was set to retire. Hes still holding off, Gus said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

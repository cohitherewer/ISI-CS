 Latif quits as Pak skipper
 - 34-year-old keen to continue as a player  Rashid LatifKarachi: Beleaguered Rashid Latif, who ended a five-match ban at the weekend, resigned as captain of Pakistan on Wednesday. I have stepped down as captain, the reasons for which I dont want to discuss now, Latif said. But I have not retired as a player and I am available for the home series against South Africa (starting next month). I have my reasons for deciding against captaining the side, but I am very keen to play against South Africa and thereafter, he added. The 34-year-old Latif decided to step down a day after being warned by the PCB to act more responsibly if he wanted to retain the position. The PCB can only confirm that Rashid has resigned. He has given no reason to us for his decision, PCB spokesman Samiul Hasan said. Latif, whose five-match suspension by the ICC ended when Pakistan completed a 5-0 whitewash of their one-day series against Bangladesh in Karachi on Sunday, has been at odds with the PCB since August. The PCB let him off with a reprimand after he wrote a letter, which he later released to the public, to the ICC warning of the menaces of match-fixing. Local media also reported that Latif and chief selector Aamer Sohail had disagreements during the Test series against Bangladesh. The PCBs warning to Latif earlier this week came amidst speculation that it might retain Inzamam-ul-Haq as captain for the home series against South Africa. As stand-in skipper for the banned Latif, Inzamam led Pakistan to a 5-0 clean sweep in the one-day series against Bangladesh. Latif captained Pakistan for the 1997-98 tours to South Africa and Zimbabwe before temporarily retiring at his prime, saying he was suffering from burn-out but amid reports he had made match-fixing allegations against teammates. He was recalled after a three-year exile in 2001 and was reappointed captain in place of Waqar Younis after the World Cup. The PCB had announced Latif would continue as captain until the tour to New Zealand in December and January. However PCB chief Tauqir Zia said on Tuesday that Latif had to show more maturity and responsibility.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

																								New Delhi: The BCCI has decided to share 26 per cent of its revenue with cricketers to ensure that the players do not feel any financial insecurity.																								The working committee of the BCCI, which met Wednesday, decided that half of the 26 per cent share  which comes to about Rs 25 crore  will go to international cricketers while the other half will be reserved for the domestic players, board president Jagmohan Dalmiya announced.																								Dalmiya said 80 per cent of the share reserved for domestic players would be distributed among first class cricketers while the rest would be for the juniors.																								The revenues acquired from sponsorship rights, media rights, tour guarantees, share of profits from World Cup and other events, merchandising and licensing rights and guarantee money from affiliated units for allotment of international matches would be shared with the players.																								However, the money coming from the sponsors of junior cricket, National Cricket Academy and the umpires would not be shared with the cricketers, nor would the interests from fixed deposits the board has in banks, Dalmiya said.																								As reported by The Telegraph on January 12, the president confirmed the introduction of a new limited-overs day-night meet, the Corporate Cup, where the teams would be allowed to field a maximum of four foreign players.																								The board also decided to institute its own ratings system and an annual award function from this year. It also made it mandatory for all staging associations to furnish their ticket printers certificate in order to avoid over-crowding in stadiums. (PTI)

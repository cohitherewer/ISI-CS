The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, December 29, 2003  Form served as right guideline 
 BY STAR RACER Shankar				 										The current form of horses and the betting in the bookmakers ring served as the right guideline in Wednesdays six-event card, though Tasmacs upset victory in the Madras Race Club Cup was an exception to the rule. Race goers would have also liked to see Andropov making the line-up but Vijay Singhs hot-favourite became a non-starter, along with The Flying Star and New Reality in the 1,100m Oakmead Hnadicap. Therefore, Flying Dash won the race virtually by a default, as the rest of the five in the contest were, virtually, poor performers during the on going season.				 										Tasmac, a speed merchant, and better known for his prowess only over sharp sprints, found the going easy over a seven-furlong trip when ridden in a check. The recent migrant from Mumbai was held back behind the leader Anokato until 300m from home before apprentice Islam, partnering the Bharath Singh-trainee, hurried to the front and left the field standing.				 										Errol Bhungards Flying Dash found the race tailor-made for her after Andropov cried off from the field. The Forest Fair-Goodness Me three-year-old was luxuriously stationed in the rear by Amyn Merchant and the jockey made his move only nearing the home turn. Hitting the front 250m from home, she carried her topweight to victory the way she desired.				 										The 1,200m Air Force Cup saw a quietly fancied Modesto lifting the trophy in a convincing manner. It was good to see the Metal Precieux-Mea Culpa colt returning to winning ways. He had miserably failed in the monsoon classics after winning a sprint in quite comfortably. The Vijay Singh-trainee seems to relish shorter sprints and it may take a little time before he could be trusted over a 1,400m trip. He was, however, given a waiting race and he easily settled in-fourth behind Secret Blessing, Ever Lasting Love and Far Hope till into the final stretch. Modesto led 300m from home and was eased up in last half-a-furlong, thus allowed Far Hope to finish within a length behind.				 										Shanker, who rode a well-judged race on Modesto, repeated the strategy on the H. S. Bath-favourite Majestic Crown. The only exception he made on this occasion was that he waited a little longer and sent the White Crown-Miss Hattie six-year-old into the lead 1,50m from home to have the measure of the Bharath-duo of Wordsworth and Frontier Flame.				 										Errols Bay Dragon, the 7-4 favourite, was fully tested by Vijays Actable. Had it not been a raw apprentice Shane Domingo doing duty on Actable, the winning-post might have eluded Merchant. It was a virtual last-stride victory from Bay Dragon after the horse was toiling in sixth and joined the issue 200m from home.

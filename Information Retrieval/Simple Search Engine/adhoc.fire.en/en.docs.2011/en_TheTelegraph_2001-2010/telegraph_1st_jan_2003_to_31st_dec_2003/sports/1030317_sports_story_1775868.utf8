 Movies on Warnes agenda
 London: Disgraced Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne wants to utilise his one-year ban from all organised cricket in a constructive way and is planning either to play for a celebrity cricket team or feature in a movie. Warne is negotiating with a club in Kent to play in charity matches, a leading London tabloid reported Sunday. We know that Shane will not be allowed to play organised league cricket but Lashings play charity games, The Mail on Sunday quoted Warnes brother Jason, who also acts as his agent, as saying. Our position is not clear and we cannot agree any deal until it is. But if Shane is to keep himself match-fit, he needs to be playing against top-class batsmen  with Lashings or wherever, Jason said. Warne, in the meanwhile, is back home studying the terms of a movie offer from a major Australian filmmaker, the report said. The champion leg-spinner was sent home from the World Cup without playing a match after a drugs test revealed the presence of banned diuretics. An independent drugs tribunal held him guilty and banned him till February 2004. The ban also meant Warne missed the first year of his 100,000 deal to captain Hampshire.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McCaw to meet Dalmiya in city on Thursday
New Delhi: Allistair McCaw, who is one of the contenders for Indian cricket teams trainers post, will hold a formal discussion with the top echelons of the BCCI in Calcutta next week. South African McCaw will arrive in Calcutta on Thursday next for a meeting with Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya, a top board official said. Also present at the meeting will be coach John Wright and physio Andrew Leipus who are seen as instrumental in recommending McCaws name. The Indian teams trainers post fell vacant following South African Adrian Le Rouxs sudden pull out earlier this month. McCaw has impressive credentials, having worked with the Holland team during the 2003 World Cup, besides being associated with leading PGA golfers and ATP professionals. McCaw also shaped the fitness of world class athletes in triathlon such as Rorie Mackie and international rugby squads like Kempton Wolves. If BCCI comes to an arrangement with McCaw, the proposal will be put for approval at the working committee meeting in New Delhi on July 2 and 3.  (PTI)  Copyright

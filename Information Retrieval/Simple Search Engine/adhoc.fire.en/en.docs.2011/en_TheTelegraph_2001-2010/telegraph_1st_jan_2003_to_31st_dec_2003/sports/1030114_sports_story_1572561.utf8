The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Sensational debut by Anushree 
																								Pune: India junior number three Anushree Saha of Bengal played the match of her life when she defeated seasoned N. Arul Selvi of Tamil Nadu in the opening round of the womens singles in the 64th senior national table tennis championship here on Monday.																								The 15-year-old Anushree was down three-nil and trailing 3-6 in the fourth game. However, from that precarious position, she bounced back in style to shock Arul Selvi 9-11, 7-11, 5-11, 11-9, 11-7, 11-6, 11-4.																								I had almost given up but the cheers from senior players Poulumi Ghatak and Mouma Das helped me gain confidence to turn the tables on my rival, Anushree, who is making her debut in the senior nationals, said after the match.																								Anushrees teammate Shinjini Mitra, however, had to make the exit after a spirited battle against Juipi Borthakur of Assam. In the mens section, Maharashtras Rohit Chowdhury, spurred by the fine showing by the state women players, outclassed Rajiv Ghai of Delhi. (pti)

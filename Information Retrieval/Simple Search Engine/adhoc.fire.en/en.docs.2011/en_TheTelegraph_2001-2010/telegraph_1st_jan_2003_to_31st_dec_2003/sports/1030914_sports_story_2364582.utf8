The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India stage for year-end show
 BY AMITAVA DAS GUPTA  Its a special bond between Navratilova and Paes Calcutta, Sept. 13: If Leander Paes proposes, how can Martina Navratilova refuse? The idea of the red-hot mixed doubles team playing some exhibition matches in India was popped up a couple of months ago and Martina had readily agreed. And even though a brain lesion subsequently rocked Leanders life, Martina remains steadfast in her commitment: she is willing to make the trip to India as and when her good friend and true partner is ready. That day doesnt seem too far off and the proposed series in different cities could materialise sometime in November or December. Thats the best time as its off-season for players both on the ATP and WTA Tour, a source told The Telegraph. Of course, there are a couple of important riders attached to the fulfilment of this dream project. First and foremost is Leanders recovery from the parasitic infection which laid him low almost a month ago. The family and, indeed, the entire nation breathed a sigh of relief the day it was ascertained that the four-millimetre inflammation on the left side of Leanders brain was not a cancerous tumour. But even a worm infection in the brain can take weeks to heal. Next Thursdays MRI would, in fact, reveal how much it has responded to medication over the past fortnight. The hint of tension notwithstanding, there is a quiet optimism in the Paes camp. Though Leander is reconciled to the fact that he would be missing Indias next Davis Cup tie versus Holland and five ATP tournaments thereafter, he is eyeing two events before 2003 becomes history. One is the season-ending Masters Doubles Championship in Houston for which he and Czech partner David Rikl should qualify even if they dont play any more tournament together. The other is the proposed series with Martina. Not often does a living legend, who owns almost every tennis record in the book, agree to visit an alien country to play exhibition matches. Its the special bond she enjoys with the Indian ace which influenced her decision, and Leander is determined to utilise this opportunity. A project of this magnitude will never see the light of the day unless it receives the corporate sectors blessings. And despite cricket taking up the lions share of big companies sport budgets, a one-off project involving Martina seems to have enough takers. A couple of heavyweight sponsors showed interest when they were approached almost a month back, and a private TV channel was more than keen to consider live coverage, but Leanders hospitalisation has put negotiations on the back-burner. Its time now to revive those talks and that is one of the reasons why Leander is set to shift base from Orlando to Mumbai in a weeks time after taking doctors permission to fly. He will still need to rest and be under Dr B.S. Singhals supervision, but that wont stop him from trying to sell the Martina project. Details of the series can only be finalised after discussions with potential sponsors, but as per the preliminary proposal, Australian Open and Wimbledon champions Leander-Martina will play against another established mixed doubles pair in three or four cities in as many days. In case two more big enough names cannot be convinced to take part in the exhibition series, some celebrity tennis players will be approached to test their skills against the 46-year-old American legend and the 30-year-old Indian maestro. The only jarring note is the absence of Leanders hometown from the preliminary shortlist, but its a market-driven effect. Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai are high up on the sponsors wish-list. The City of Joy may get left out, as indeed could the nations capital.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, January 20, 2003  Joe The Pro may win in Mysore 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Mysore: Back from his Bangalore campaign, The Z. Darashah-ward Joe The Pro looks good for an encore in the 1,200m Coimbatore Plate on Monday. Working well during his trials in Bangalore, the Razeen-Divine Colours gelding is expected to have things his own way. Frontier Hero, a consistent performer here is expected to spearhead the challenge, but considering that he was beaten by The Pro when they last met, Suraj Narredu may steer him home with a measure of comfort.

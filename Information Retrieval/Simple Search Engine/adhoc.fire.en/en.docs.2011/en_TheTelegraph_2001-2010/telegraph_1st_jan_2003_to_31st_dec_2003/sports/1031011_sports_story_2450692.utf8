 Gold for Anjali
New Delhi: Anjali Bhagwat won the air rifle gold at the World Cup finals in Milan on Friday. Anjali, who had won the silver at the same event last year, shot 502.4 to win the yellow metal ahead of Chinas Du Li (501.1) and Japans Hiromi Misaki (500). The World Cup final features the ten best performers in the four World Cups of the year. Anjali, who was conferred the countrys highest sport award of Khel Ratna last month, shot 399 in the preliminary and 103.4 in the final round. World champion Katerina Kurkova of the Czech Republic finished fifth while defending champion Lioubob Galkina of Russia ended sixth. On the disappointing note, Abhinav Bindra failed to make it to the final round of the air rifle event, finishing last among the ten contestants with a score of 590.  (PTI)  Copyright

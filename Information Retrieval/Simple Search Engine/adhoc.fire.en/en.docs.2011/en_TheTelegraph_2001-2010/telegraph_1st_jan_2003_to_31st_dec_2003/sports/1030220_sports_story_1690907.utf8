The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fielding worries Hooper 
Benoni: West Indies skipper Carl Hooper said on Wednesday that the disappointment of his teams washed-out match against Bangladesh will be the springboard for his sides assault on a Super Sixes place. Hooper had to share the four points when Tuesdays game here was abandoned because of torrential rain but believes the outcome may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for the crucial clash with Sri Lanka in Cape Town on February 28. Im disappointed that we were not able to get four points, said Hooper. We cant do anything about the weather. We have been in situations before where the weather saved us. Wednesday it probably saved Bangladesh, that was out of our control so we just have to look forward to the next game, said Hooper. Meanwhile, the 36-year-old Hooper said he is concerned about his teams fielding and the poor performance of his openers in the tournament. We dropped a couple of straight forward catches. This is something we obviously have got to work on, if we want to go all the way. Of openers Chris Gayle and Wavell Hinds, he said: The tracks are a little bit different here and they are probably struggling a bit but I think they will come good eventually. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England reach 165/2
 - Pollock joins 300-wicket club  Jacques Kallis scored 66 on Friday London: Shaun Pollock became the second South African to take 300 Test wickets as England closed on 165 for two in reply to the touring sides 484 on Friday. The 30-year-old seamer, who also hit 66 earlier in the day, reached the mark when he induced England captain Michael Vaughan to overstretch for a ball on off-stump and edge to third slip. Vaughan, wretchedly out of form since scoring 156 in the first Test  he has now made 149 in his next eight knocks  had promised something substantial with a series of flashing cover drives before departing for 23. Pollock, the 19th man to take 300 wickets in Test history and joining compatriot Allan Donald (330 wickets) on the list, has taken his wickets at just over 20 apiece. No bowler on that list ended their career with a better average. Vaughan was followed by Mark Butcher (32) before Marcus Trescothick (64 n.o.) and Graham Thorpe (28n.o.), back in the side after a years exile, put on 87 before bad light ended the day four overs early. While it was Englands day, South Africa remained in a strong position. Needing only a draw to win their first series in England since 1965, they had resumed on 362 for four with a total of around 600 runs in mind. One key moment in the morning session, however, killed off that ambition as the last seven wickets fell for 122. Jacques Kallis, on 66, was trying to relaunch the innings after the early morning departures of Jacques Rudolph and Mark Boucher when, backing up, he was run out at the non-strikers end.

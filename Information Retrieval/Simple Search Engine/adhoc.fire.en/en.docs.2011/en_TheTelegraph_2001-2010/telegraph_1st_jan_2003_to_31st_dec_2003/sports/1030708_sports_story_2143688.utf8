 Dravid hits unbeaten 129 
London: Rahul Dravids unbeaten 129 proved not enough to see Scotland through Nottinghamshire in the English National League one-day match at Edinburgh on Sunday. The India vice-captain helped Scotland make 222 for seven wickets in 45 overs. But riding Chris Cairns 65 not out, Nottinghamshire reached the target with 3.5 overs to go.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

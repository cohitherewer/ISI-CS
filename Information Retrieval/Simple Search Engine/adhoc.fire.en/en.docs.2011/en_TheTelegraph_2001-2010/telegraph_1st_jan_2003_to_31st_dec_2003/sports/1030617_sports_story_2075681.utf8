 Kournikova, Haas pull out
Wimbledon: Anna Kournikova has pulled out of Wimbledon because of a back injury. The Wimbledon referees office said on Monday the Russian had notified the All England Club of her withdrawal on Friday. German Tommy Haas also pulled out on Monday, saying he needed more time to recover from a shoulder injury. The Wimbledon Championships starts next Monday. Kournikova withdrew from the DFS Classic grass-court tournament in Birmingham last Monday after aggravating her injury in practice. Haas said he no longer felt any pain but could still not serve properly.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

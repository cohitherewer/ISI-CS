Got by for much of his career playing on-side strokes, owing to a grip that harked back to his hockey background (he has played for South Africa and would probably have played in the 1992 Olympics if the team had qualified). Since remodelled his grip. Excellent sweeper. Quit Test cricket at the end of 2000 to devote more time to his wife and daughter while playing ODIs. Immediately hit five 50s in a row.MONDE ZONDEKI Born: July 25, 1982. Right arm fast bowler.

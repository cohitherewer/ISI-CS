 Steve yet to make up his mind
Sydney: Australias 37-year-old Test captain Steve Waugh is still considering retirement and has yet to confirm his availability for the West Indies tour in April. I havent really felt like making a decision at this stage and I dont want to be pressured into saying yes or no, Waugh said on Tuesday. I know that I said I would take a couple of weeks to make one but Ive stretched that into a month and a bit longer, Test crickets third-highest run-scorer added. I want to make sure its the right decision and it hasnt come to me yet. SA main danger Waugh said he was not writing off South Africa in the World Cup, saying the Proteas were still Australias main danger. After losses to West Indies and New Zealand, South Africa must win every game and hope West Indies beat Sri Lanka just to survive the pool matches. Australia, just as with South Africa this time, lost two of its first three games in 1999 but still won the World Cup in England. I think they are still a good chance of doing well, Waugh said.

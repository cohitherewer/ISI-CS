The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India not taking China lightly
Kuala Lumpur, Sept. 20 (PTI): With the Champions Trophy debacle still fresh in their minds, a determined India launch their Asia Cup hockey campaign on Sunday against minnows China. Coach Rajinder Singhhas warned his players not to get complacent. The curtain raiser will see Pakistan lock horns with Bangladesh. Two more matches are scheduled  Japan vs Hong Kong and Malaysia vs holders South Korea. India, placed in pool B, finished third in the previous edition. We have not played China for more than four years. But I must say they have improved considerably and are capable of springing a surprise, Rajinder said after the teams practice. But we want to win this meet for injured Jugraj Singh. Meawhile, IOA secretary Randhir Singh called on Jugraj in Ludhiana and assured him he would not be out of a job, following uncertainty over a few sportspersons employed with the Punjab Police.

 Grischuk holds Anand to draw
Cap Dfagde (France): Viswanathan Anand started his campaign with a fighting draw with Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk of Russia in the first round of the World Rapid Chess Championship here on Friday. Worlds strongest-ever woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary took off in style by defeating local challenge Joel Lautier. Apart from Judit, only Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and Russian champion Peter Svidler could make a winning start that gives just another indication of the tough battles in the opening game. The tournament has two groups with eight players each and four from each group will qualify to the next stage after playing a round-robin league. Thereafter the event will be a knockout. Anand really had some tall task on hand and eventually, despite giving it a very hard try, the Indian ace had to take the draw with Grischuk.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Kannan trips sixth seed
 Vijay Kannan, who ousted Bjorn Rehnquist in three sets Bangalore: Indias Vijay Kannan rallied from behind to oust sixth seed Bjorn Rehnquist of Sweden 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 and move into the second round of the Indian Oil Servo ATP Challenger tennis championship here on Tuesday. Kannan, who made the main draw as a lucky loser, came back strongly after a tentative start to carve out a memorable outing. I was really lucky (to get into the main draw), 23-year-old Kannan, ranked 508 in the world, said. Rehnquist incidentally is ranked some 325 spots above him. However, it was a mixed day for India. Rohan Bopanna, Indias top singles player, breezed past unseeded Arvind Parmar of Britain 6-4, 6-2 Another Indian, wild card entrant Prakash Amritraj went down to unseeded Bulgarian Todor Enev 1-6, 3-6. Much was expected from 19-year-old Prakash, son of the legendary Vijay Amritraj, but nothing seemed to go his way as Enev overpowered him. Even in doubles, the Indian duo of Harsh Mankad and Vishal Uppal was defeated by the second seeded Russian pair of Yuri Schukin and Dmitry Vlasov 6-4, 6-4 who made the quarter final. Top seed Noam Okun of Israel and seventh seed Tuomas Ketola of Finland advanced to the pre-quarters with ease. Okun, world number 144, beat Frances Rodolphe Cadart 6-2, 6-3, while Ketola accounted for Gouichi Motomura of Japan 6-3, 6-1. ut fifth seed Yen-Hsun Lu of Taipei crashed out, losing to South African Loius Vosloo 2-6, 1-6. In an all-Russian affair, Dmitry Vlasov got the better of Yuri Schukin 6-0, 6-7 (3-7), 6-2, while Germanys Maxmilian Abel beat Jonathan Erlich of Israel 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 7-6 (9-7). In other first round matches on Tuesday, Peter Wessels of the Netherlands defeated Italys Federico Luzzi 6-4, 6-4, while Fred Hammes Jr packed off Swedens Johan Settergren 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). Also making the doubles quarter final were top-seeded Australians Nathan Healey and Alan Jones, who scored a 6-1, 7-5 win over the American-Japanese team of Doug Bohaboy and Motomura.

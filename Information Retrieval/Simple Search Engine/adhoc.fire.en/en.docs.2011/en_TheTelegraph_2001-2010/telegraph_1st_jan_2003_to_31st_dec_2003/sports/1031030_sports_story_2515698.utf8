The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aggressive mind-set must: Imran
 - West Indies team of early 1980s the greatest... However, you need to counter the Aussies attacking cricket  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Calcutta: The tri-series is into its second  week but, while the immediate attention is on that tournament,  many have begun to look beyond the November 18 final. Days later, after all, Team India will be off to Australia  for four Tests and a triangular. It will be our toughest  tour in years and, in Imran Khans opinion, the Sourav Gangulys  must have an aggressive mind-set.  To counter the Australians, youve  got to be aggressive and that has to be reflected in your  mind-set Be it batting or bowling, they attack relentlessly  You should, therefore, counter that The other day, for  example, aggression enabled India beat the world champions  (in Gwalior), Imran, a veteran of many campaigns against  Australia, told The Telegraph on Wednesday. Speaking (from Dubai) on the eve of his 24-hour trip to Mumbai for an awards function, he added: I agree the Australians are ahead of the rest  particularly in Test cricket  but I wouldnt say the sport hasnt seen a greater side. In my book, the West Indies team of the early 1980s remains the greatest According to Imran, the 1992 World Cup-winning captain who is now a Member of the National Assembly, India will do well in Australia if (a) Zaheer Khan fires and (b) the batsmen dig in. The mind-set bit goes without saying. Zaheer has the pace and skill to get the most out of pitches in Australia I expect him to use the bounce to advantage Of course, he will need support  from Ashish Nehra, I suppose, assuming he is fit I do accept you have two of the finest spinners (Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh) but, in Australia, they come into play on the last two days only. However, I would always have Kumble in the XI, Imran pointed out. He continued: My advice to your batsmen is simple: Dig in and stay put History shows that the ones who have got through the early phases, have gone on to collect big runs The ball comes on to the bat and shot-making isnt difficult. But, then, to flourish you must first survive. Also, never look for shortcuts Clearly, India is fortunate to have a Rahul Dravid He can play the sheet anchors role to perfection... How much of a difference can Sachin Tendulkar make? Potentially, lots Incidentally, Ive been misquoted on the matchwinner issue  he definitely is one. Imran had a word or two about (regular captain) Sourav: Look, he must be aggressive I know he has a reputation for being so, but he wasnt in the World Cup final Moreover, Sourav should remember that leading from the front makes the biggest difference. Talking from experience, even the best coach can make a marginal difference. Yet, a captain who leads from the front, can do so significantly Happy with Pakistans Test series victory over South Africa, he said: Frankly, I didnt expect Graeme Smiths men to be a huge threat Be it in Pakistan or India, a visiting side will succeed only if it has an outstanding spinner and/or an express bowler In the sub-continent, you cant win with medium pace Our team is certainly coming along and, at full strength, our attack can match the Australians Shoaib (Akhtar), (Mohammed) Sami Plus the rest Quite a handful, isnt it? Must Waqar Younis, who refuses to quit, be recalled? Well, I dont know how he is bowling We already have a good attack (without Waqar), Imran responded, sending a message to the one-time spearhead. Imran, though, isnt too pleased with Pakistans batting: The consistency isnt there, but Ive been impressed by young Taufeeq Umar He seems to get better each time I see him Generally, it hasnt helped that our selectors have been chopping and changing batsmen The turnover has been sizeable and its not healthy. Speaking about Inzamam-ul Haqs captaincy, he observed: Inzy hasnt done anything wrong So, I dont see why he shouldnt get a longer tenure.  Having consistently called for regular bilateral exchanges  between India and Pakistan, Imran (understandly) is delighted  that Team India will be making a visit  the first since  late 1997  next February.

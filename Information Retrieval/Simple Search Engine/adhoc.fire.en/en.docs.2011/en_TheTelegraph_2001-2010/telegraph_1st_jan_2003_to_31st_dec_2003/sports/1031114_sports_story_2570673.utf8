The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kartik inclusion puts Kumble under pressure 
 - Selectors name 20 not 16; Deep certain to make squad proper to be named on Saturday  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Bangalore: Unimpressed by three successive defeats in the current tri-series, the national selectors put on hold the Team India 16 for the four Tests in Australia. Instead, Syed Kirmani and Co. have named 20, with four to be eliminated on Saturday, after Indias last league game (in effect, the semi-final) in Hyderabad. In any case, this hastily-reached arrangement suits captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright, who favoured the selection after the crunch match (versus New Zealand). Their reasons, though, were different. Now, more than anybody else, veteran Anil Kumble is under much pressure as Murali Kartik has been included as well. Given that just two spinners  one of whom will be Harbhajan Singh  are slated to make the trip, Kartik has emerged a strong contender after troubling the Ricky Pontings in Wednesdays game here. Of course, one-day cricket is far removed from the longer version, but the left-armer keeps putting his best foot forward  limited opportunities notwithstanding. Incidentally, that Kartik had emerged the dark horse was reported in Thursdays Late City edition of The Telegraph. One understands Zimbabwean Raymond Prices recent success in Australia played a hand in Kartiks selection. However, dropping Indias most successful spinner isnt going to be an easy task. Saturdays meeting could well be tumultuous. From Bengals point of view, Deep Dasgupta is back 21 months after his last India appearance. As two wicketkeepers will be on the flight to Australia, and Parthiv Patel is the only other gloveman in the 20, Deeps presence in the squad is guaranteed. Parthiv, though, will go as the No.1 keeper. That Norths Kirti Azad didnt attend the over three-hour selection committee meeting at the KSCA HQ, at the Chinnaswamy, helped Deeps cause which was strongly advocated by the captain himself and Easts Pranab Roy. The possibility of recalling Ajay Ratra was discussed but, with Wright backing Sourav, the issue was settled in Deeps favour. Also set to make a comeback is opener Sadagopan Ramesh. Officially, the left-hander is in a three-way race with middle order batsmen Yuvraj Singh and Hemang Badani, but well-placed sources are convinced he will eventually make the 16. Ramesh has been in the dumps after the 2001-2002 tour of Sri Lanka. The squad will have two other openers in Virender Sehwag, who prefers batting in the middle, and Akash Chopra. Actually, 14 of the 16 berths are confirmed  unless theres a drastic rethink over the next day-and-half  with just the second spinners and the slot headed Rameshs way left to be finalised. Assuming that Ramesh makes it and Kumble doesnt, there will only be six other survivors from the 1999-2000 line-up: Sourav (then the vice-captain), Rahul Dravid (present vice-captain), Sachin Tendulkar (the then captain), V.V.S. Laxman, Ajit Agarkar and Harbhajan. Meanwhile, exactly a year after speculation began on the appointment of a bowling coach, that bit has again started doing the rounds. However, the Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya clarified that nothing had been discussed in any forum. He knows best. LIKELY 16 (as of Thursday night) Batsmen: Virender Sehwag, Akash Chopra, Sadagopan Ramesh, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S. Laxman. Wicketkeepers: Parthiv Patel, Deep Dasgupta. Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Murali Kartik/Anil Kumble. New ball bowlers: Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Ajit Agarkar, Avishkar Salvi, Lakshmipathy Balaji. Named in 20, but not strongly placed: Yuvraj Singh, Hemang Badani. Named in 20, but out of contention: Irfan Pathan.  Copyright

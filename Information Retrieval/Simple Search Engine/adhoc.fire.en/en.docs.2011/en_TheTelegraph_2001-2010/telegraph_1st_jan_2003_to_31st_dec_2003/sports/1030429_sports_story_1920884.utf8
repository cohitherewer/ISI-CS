Suresh, spinners D. Dhandapani and Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan for special treatment. Earlier, after dismissing Tamil Nadu for 261 in the second innings, Delhi lost three quick wickets for 26. Paceman L. Balaji removed Gautam Gambhir (0) Akash Chopra and Mithun Minhas. Earlier, resuming at 88 for four, Tamil Nadu added 173 with Ramesh and Sharath adding 81 for the fifth wicket. Negi was the most successful bowler for Delhi with three wickets. BRIEF SCORES Tamil Nadu 327 amp; 261 (S. Sharath 75 n.o., V Sarvanan 34; Negi 3/41, Sarandeep 2/40).

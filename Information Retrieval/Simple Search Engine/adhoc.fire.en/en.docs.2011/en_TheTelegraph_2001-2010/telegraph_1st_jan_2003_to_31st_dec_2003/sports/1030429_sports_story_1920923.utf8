Apart from confirming Jose Ramirez Barreto for one more stint, Mohun Bagan have roped in Vascos Brazilian striker Marcos Perreira. Dempos India midfielder Samir Naik is also a strong possibility, while another international Rennedy Singh is strongly favoured to remain with the three-time National League champions.

Mohun Bagan are yet to name a coach and the tenure of Bidesh Bose and Shyamal Banerjee got over with the completion of the National League on Monday. Surkumar for EB East Bengal, meanwhile, have struck a deal with Mahindra United defender Surkumar Singh. The Manipuri player spent a season with East Bengal in 2000-01 before moving to Mumbai.

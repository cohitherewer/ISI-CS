 Pakistan to host Bangla in August
Karachi: Pakistan will host Bangladesh for three Tests and five one-day Internationals in August, to mark the return of international cricket to the country troubled by a wave of terrorist attacks in the past two years, officials said Wednesday. We hope that the home season gets full cricket for the sake of fans and players in the country, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said. International cricket is returning to Pakistan and if we are able to hold a home-and-away one-day series with India, it will be a real boost to cricket, Rameez said. Pakistan played their two home series  against the West Indies and Australia  on neutral grounds last year after both refused to tour Pakistan over security fears. Bangladesh will start their 36-day tour with a warm-up game in Karachi before the first Test on August 24. The remaining two Tests will be played in Multan and Peshawar. THE ITINERARY First Test: Aug. 20-24, Karachi; Second Test: Aug. 27-31, Multan; Third Test: Sept. 3-7, Peshawar. One-day Internationals: Sept. 10: Rawalpindi; Sept. 13: Faisalabad; Sept. 16: Lahore; Sept. 19: Multan; Sept. 22: Karachi.  (AFP)  Copyright

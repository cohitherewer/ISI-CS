The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussie academy shifted to Brisbane
Adelaide: Australias cricket academy will be moved from Adelaide, its home for the past 16 years, to Brisbane, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Monday. The CA said the centre will be based at Albion. The academy has produced 139 first class players, 32 of whom have represented Australia at the international level. The decision came as a disappointment for the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA), which had put in a strong bid to keep the centre in Adelaide. Obviously we are disappointed, but South Australia has successfully hosted the cricket academy since its inception in 1987, SACA president Ian McLachlan said.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Humpy loses twice, Ramesh in sole lead
New Delhi: GM Koneru Humpy was made to bite the dust twice Monday by lesser-known opponents in the Pasrvnath international chess tournament here. The Asian womens champion has now suffered three defeats in seven rounds of the Rs 3,00,000 prize money tournament and was lucky enough to garner full points from two ties, which she looked destined to lose. Meanwhile, GM norm holder R. B. Ramesh moved into to sole lead at the end of the seventh round after he defeated GM Saidali Iuldachev of Uzbekistan in 37 moves. Humpy, who lost to C. Praveen Kumar in the second round, lost in the morning session to Integral Coach Factorys R. Balasubramaniam while Shashikant Kutwal of Maharashtra rubbed salt into the wounds as he outplayed the favourite in 64 moves in the evening. Kutwal playing the Sicilian Defence took advantage of some sloppy middle game play by Humpy to move into third spot in the points tally. Earlier in the day, Balasubramaniam was virtually handed the tie by the Andhra girl who blundered on the 31st move, when she was comfortably placed. In other top board games, GM P. Harikrishna played a quick draw with GM Jonathan Rowson of Scotland to park himself in second position along with five others, with six points each. Top seed Dmitry Svetushkin of Moldova ended the dream run of local hope Vishal Sareen as the LIC player conceded the full point to his opponent. Meanwhile, IM Verghese Koshy defeated GM Marat Dhzumaev of Uzbekistan in the morning and then got the better of IM S. Kidambi, rated more than 100 points above him. On Monday local hope and IM norm holder Vishal Sareen had caused a flutter defeating GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly in the fifth round. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 4-wicket victory for Kenya
Cape Town: Ian Billcliff struck a patient 71 as Canada were bowled out for 197 by Kenya in their World Cup group B match on Saturday. Kenya beat Canada by four wickets, reaching the target in 49 overs. Ravindu Shah top scored with 61. Thomas Odoyo remained unbeaten on 27. Captain Joseph Harris and Billcliff shared a third-wicket partnership of 86 to give Canada, fresh from their shock win over Bangladesh, a solid foundation, but Thomas Odoyo took four wickets to give Kenya a good chance of victory. Odoyo had struck an early blow for Kenya when he bowled Ishwar Maraj for five, but opener John Davison made a run-a-ball 31, including two big sixes and two fours, before he was caught by Collins Obuya off Peter Ongondo. Desmond Chumney was then caught by Ravindu Shah off Obuya for 10 to leave Canada in trouble at 48 for three before Billcliff and captain Harris dug in. Billcliff reached his 50 off 81 balls, including two sixes and five fours. The pair was just beginning to accelerate when Harris was caught by a diving Tony Suji for 31. Billcliff was bowled by Suji after being deceived in the flight, sparking a flurry of late wickets. Nicholas de Groot was palpably leg-before to Maurice Odumbe who then bowled Fazil Samad as he swung wildly across the line before Odoyo forced Sanjayan Thuraisingham to sky a catch to wicketkeeper David Obuya. Austin Codrington, who took five wickets to inspire the victory over Bangladesh, arrived at the crease, but Odoyo struck again in the same over when Ashish Bagai edged a simple catch to the wicketkeeper.

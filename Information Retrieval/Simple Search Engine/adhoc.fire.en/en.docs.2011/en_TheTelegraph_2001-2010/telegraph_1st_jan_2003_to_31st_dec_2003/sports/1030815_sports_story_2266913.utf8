		 Friday, August 15, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Frankfurt: Germany lost two soccer stars on Thursday with the passing of Helmut Rahn, 73, and Lothar Emmerich, 61.				 																																	Rahn scored the winning goal to give West Germany the 1954 World Cup title. His goal gave Germany an unexpected 3-2 victory over Hungary in the final at Bern, Switzerland. 				 																																	Three players from the team are still alive  Horst Eckel, Ottmar Walter and Hans Schaefer. Rahn, whose death was announced by the German soccer federation, would have turned 74 on Friday. Emmerich, also a forward for Borussia Dortmund, was a member of Germanys 1966 World Cup squad and played in the 2-4 final defeat by England. 				 																																	Munich: Bayern Munich general manager Uli Hoeness claims that new signing Roy Makaay is five times more valuable than Real Madrids 35 million euro capture David Beckham. The Dutch front-man, 28, cost the German champions a club-record 18.75 million euros from Deportivo La Coruna, but Hoeness believes the price-tag represents good value in comparison with other close season transfers. 				 																																	I would rather have paid five times as much for Roy (Makaay) than David Beckham, Hoeness said on Thursday. He scored 29 goals in Spain, the toughest league in the world.				 																																	New York: Mike Tysons recent bankruptcy filing has delayed the ex-heavyweight champions best shot at a potential huge pay-day: his civil lawsuit against promoter Don King.				 																																	In a meeting this week with judge George Daniels, both sides agreed to put off the scheduled September 22 civil trial until April, attorneys said on Wednesday. 				 																																	Tyson claimed in an August 1 filing that he was now broke despite earning an estimated $300 million in the ring. In his lawsuit filed in 1998 against King, he alleged the promoter siphoned away millions of dollars in earnings. Tyson is suing his former promoter for $100 million. King has denied he did anything wrong.				 																																	London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Thursday that he would support Sol Campbell all the way in his anticipated battle to avoid FA sanctions over an on-field clash with Manchester United midfielder Eric Djemba-Djemba.				 																																	Campbell is facing a three-match ban from the FA after being reported for violent conduct during last Sundays Community Shield defeat to United where he clashed with the Cameroonian.				 																																	Wenger says Campbell is innocent  and called for sanctions instead on the Cameroon midfielder whose high tackle on Campbell he called obscene.				 																																	Kozhikode: A 19-member strong contingent will represent India in the 10th Asian womens chess championship to be held here from Saturday. According to Fide vice president and organising committee secretary P.T. Ummer Koya, 40 players from seven countries will compete in the 11-day tournament.

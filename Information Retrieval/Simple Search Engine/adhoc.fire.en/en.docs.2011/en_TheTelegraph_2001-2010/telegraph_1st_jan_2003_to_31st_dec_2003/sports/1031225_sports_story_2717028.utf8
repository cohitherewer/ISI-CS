 Clijsters, Hewitt get engaged
 Brussels: World No. 2 Kim Clijsters announced her engagement to boyfriend Lleyton Hewitt, a twice Grand Slam champion, on her official website on Tuesday. Lleyton has surprised me, said the 20-year-old Belgian Clijsters, who became the first Belgian to be ranked the games top player in August this year. He invited me for dinner on a boat and suddenly unveiled a ring and earrings. I didnt know what hit me, but Im very happy about it. In Australia, being engaged means a lot, added Clijsters, who won nine WTA Tour titles this year. But there are no concrete plans (for a wedding date). But Im extremely happy with my early Christmas present. Australian Hewitt, the mens world No. 17 , won the US Open in 2001 and last years Wimbledon crown. (Reuters)  Copyright

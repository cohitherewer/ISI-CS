 Olonga asylum in Aussie shadow
Sydney: Australias federal opposition has favoured granting asylum to Zimbabwe pacer Henry Olonga, who is in hiding in South Africa, and let him pursue his cricket career in the country and contribute to the game. Opposition foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd appealed to foreign minister Alexander Downer to act, saying Australia should not forget Olongas courage. I call on Mr Downer on behalf of the Australian government to organise a sporting scholarship for Henry Olonga to Australia so that he can come here to contribute to Australian cricket and to further his own personal cricketing career, Rudd said. I believe that is the right thing for Australia to do, he insisted, saying that Olongas life was at greater risk than ever. The opposition leader said he was aware that Olonga, 26, was trying to claim asylum in several countries, including England.  (PTI)  Copyright

 AIFF asks Fifa for mercy 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: While officials in Mohun Bagan are busy fighting each other, the AIFF is trying to come to the clubs rescue. On Tuesday, the club secretary issued a show-cause notice to the treasurer, while the AIFF requested the Fifa to show some mercy.

Following an appeal from the club, the AIFF has requested Fifa to waive the restriction on recruitment of foreign players. Club secretary Anjan Mitra has demanded an explanation from treasurer Keshto Saha on the basis of an allegation made by accountant Om Jhunjhunwala.The accountant has accused Saha of smuggling out important papers (cheque book etc) from the club office. Saha has been asked to reply in 48 hours.  Copyright

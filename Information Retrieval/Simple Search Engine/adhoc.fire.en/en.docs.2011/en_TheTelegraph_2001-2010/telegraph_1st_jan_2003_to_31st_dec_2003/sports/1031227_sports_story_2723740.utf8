The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ive learnt the art of survival: Kumble
 - If everything is gauged according to result, the yardstick must be same for all  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Melbourne: At 33, Anil Kumble has little left to prove. Yet, despite 364 Test wickets and 313 in the ODIs, some remain unimpressed. Moreover, not everybody remembers he is only the second bowler (after Jim Laker) to clean up all ten wickets in a single Test innings. Understandably, Kumble is somewhat hurt and that came through during his nearly hour-long chat with The Telegraph in the lead-up to the third Test. The following are excerpts On wanting to enjoy this tour I said that in reply to a question (in Adelaide)... I mean, I havent come here to prove a point or set the record straight. Im giving that hundred per cent and, if in the process I can learn, Im bound to improve. On the experience factor earning him a ticket to Australia I dont bother about selection, just do my job... Indeed, I cant be bothered, as I have no role to play in the process... Its not in my hands... I only need to look at performing and trying to win matches. On whether too much has been made of his record overseas Yes... Whether Im good or bad, everybody knows the value of Anil Kumble... Youve been watching me from my first Test series (England, 1990)... Surely, you know my worth... If everything is gauged according to the result, then the yardstick must be the same for every player. On over 13 years of international cricket (Grins) Ive learnt the art of survival... Ive enjoyed success... Have been in teams which have done well... At the international level, youve got to be motivated day in and day out... Youve got to keep performing, youve got to learn from mistakes... Yes, Ive come a long way... Of course, Ive had my share of failures but, then, that cant get dissociated from sport. On handling failure Im positive... I realise that something must have been missing for me not to have done well... I accept failures as failures... Those moments hurt, but Ive taken them in my stride. On whether he is his own fiercest critic Not many actually understand the way I bowl... So... Yes, Im a big critic of my own bowling but, as Ive stated, I learn from mistakes... I do talk to people and try and grasp something which may help me improve. In any case, one never stops learning. On his thoughts in January 2001, before the shoulder surgery in Johannesburg In India, unfortunately, the thinking is that if youre injured, then you arent fit... But, if you bowl over after over, in different grades of cricket for years on end, then the body will be affected... As it turned out, I returned stronger (after surgery)... Initially, I did have doubts but got confidence from Sris (Jawagal Srinath) experience in 1997. On being picked and dropped in 1990 I was 19 when I made my debut and, clearly, was immature... I had to quickly accept that... The first couple of years, then, were spent figuring out what was needed at the international level... In fact, not being picked for the 1991-92 tour of Australia and that seasons World Cup allowed me to work on my fitness, bowling and fielding... If you look at it, making a comeback isnt something new. On the proverbial turning point The 1992-93 tour of South Africa, when I picked up six for 53 at the Wanderers (second innings)... It enhanced my self-belief, gave the confidence that if I could do it once, I would be able to do it again too... Then, on coming back, I was Man of the Series in the home engagements versus Graham Goochs England. On criticism about the so-called designer pitches at home The designer bit has been coined after I started playing when, really, history shows that even in the pre-Anil Kumble era, visiting sides were reconciled to accepting spinning tracks... Ive never asked for designer wickets, nor have I ever complained I cant bowl because the track is too green... Ive never said dont expect wickets from me because its a flat track... (After a pause) Its strange that some terms have cropped up in my time. On his explanation for this coincidence Dont know... Probably people feel I must get help from the wicket... Otherwise, I wont be able to spin... But, then, who doesnt need help? Even batsmen need flat surfaces... If I was a batsman and got out cheaply on one, I would shoot myself... As a pro, I bowl according to the conditions... Try to do my best... I dont see why a spinner should be singled out as feeling more comfortable on a certain type of wicket. On the intensity he brings to cricket I strive for perfection, work towards excellence... That too in all grades of the game. Either the job is done with the utmost dedication, or not done at all. If things go wrong then, obviously, something has been amiss in my preparation... Thats when I take it out on myself, perhaps thats when I get too intense... Having said that, with time, Ive learnt the importance of relaxing... One cant always pick a fiver. On the driving force, so to say Aiming for excellence, consistently competing in top gear... Fulfilling my own expectations, realising those of others... Even that is a driving force. On preparing for Test matches Mentally, it begins a few days prior to the game... I stick to my routine (nets etc.) and, on the eve of the match, work out the fields Ill be having... Work out bowling to all 11... On nets Its an important part of the build-up... I could focus on just a couple of balls or on my action or... It depends... I may bowl only one over. Equally, I could have a long bowl till I get the feeling I want. Once Ive achieved my goal, Ill switch off. On whether any one batsman has made him plot harder Difficult to answer... Depends on the conditions, depends on how a particular match is placed... Ill stand a better chance of putting my point across if the surface has something for me. One tends to be patient when a tailender is around... After all, the mind-set is different when the top order guys are at the wicket. However, in the over-eagerness, theres the risk of losing the plot. On switching off on the field Just a bit in between overs... You try and take your mind away from the moment and, then, get back to where you were... On whether theres a need to interact with the Sandy Gordons He helps give your thoughts an orientation... Helps bring a meaning to what youve been thinking... Gives the thoughts a form, besides helping you understand yourself better. Some can analyse themselves and their game, others cant. Thats where Sandy has a role. Ive found him helpful. On whether he has been inspired by a non-cricketer Prakash Padukone. The way he came up and won the All-England (in 1980) is remarkable... Then, he remains so humble, unassuming... Generally, in India, theres no dearth of talent, only the mental toughness isnt there. Padukone had everything. On his level of comfort with the India captains he has played under Ive been lucky... Im not an orthodox leg-spinner and get wickets by putting the batsmen under pressure... I restrict and... because Ive got my own way of getting batsmen out, the captains have probably found it easier relating to me... More often than not, Ive been given the freedom of setting the field. Therefore, I cant complain. On whether, given a chance, he would do something differently (Smiles) Not sure... But, yes, it would have been great if we had the same support staff at the start of my career... (After a pause) I did try bowling orthodox leg-spinners, in 1990 itself, but stuck to my strengths... Perhaps, had I continued, I would have pleased a few more people... On his approach I keep it simple: A bowler is there to get wickets... As long as the needs of the team are fulfilled, its immaterial how the wickets are got... At the end of the day, its the last column that matters... Of course, not everybody may be successful on every surface but, then, thats to be seen in other sport as well. Ivan Lendl never won at Big W, yet isnt he still regarded a great? Some sportsmen adapt naturally, for others, it doesnt come that way... Do we rate batsmen as being good exclusively on turning tracks or flat wickets? So, keep it simple... Dont reduce cricket to a mathematical thing. On how different was his second stint in County cricket (Leicestershire, 2000) vis--vis the first (Northamptonshire, 1995) At Northants, besides learning, I wanted to prove that an Indian could also deliver... At that time, the focus was largely on players from the West Indies and Pakistan... The level of acceptance, for an Indian, wasnt of the same order... I wanted to change that and, looking back, I believe I did (by taking 100-plus wickets)... At Leicester, I was already established as an International... I was relaxed because I knew what I was getting into... Equally, everybody knew what to expect of me. On whether he has a target Getting to 400 Test wickets and, then, trying for a further 35 to become Indias No.1 wicket-taker... On Shane Warne Irrespective of the conditions, he has been the No. 1... He has mastered the angles and alignments... I admire him, though its a fact he has been part of a hugely successful team... That does make a difference... Im looking forward to his return... Indeed, I would love to impart his kind of spin. On serving as a role model Ive always felt the need to be disciplined... Its been a way of life... If I see something wrong, Ill speak my mind... I wont be quiet simply to avoid a controversy. On whether his engineering background comes in handy (Grins again) If anything, my education has helped me deal with success and accept failures... It has allowed me a holistic perspective to life and cricket. On handling pressure Its entirely what you perceive... The other things take care of themselves as long as I can look back on a day and tell myself I did the best I could... I dont think in terms of having to deliver just because Ive taken over 350 wickets in Tests or over 300 in the ODIs... On whether his ten-wicket haul (second innings, versus Pakistan, 1998-99) at the Kotla remains the one stand-out performance That will stay very special... However, if Im to sit down and look back, Ill go for those six wickets at the Wanderers. People may remember me for Kotla but, in terms of gaining confidence and moving ahead, that Wanderers effort will be at the top. I made a point with that haul. On whether he is indebted to anybody My family, the club (Young Cricketers, Bangalore) I started with... Teammates... Its a long list. On whether theres a worry Yes, that nowadays, there are no jobs for cricketers... And, when something is offered, its by way of a contract... Kids will remain passionate about the game but, at decision time, there will be peer pressure to opt for a proper career... This needs to be addressed. On the Indian Cricket Players Association (After a pause) At some stage, it will be part of the system... Im sure of that. Finally, his message to the young ones Be disciplined, stay focussed and, at the end of each day, go back home satisfied with the effort put in... A sense of achievement should keep you going. Moreover, keep thinking back to either a good delivery or a handsome shot and look to improve on a daily basis  if you dont, you wont get anywhere. Not in cricket, not in life either.  Copyright

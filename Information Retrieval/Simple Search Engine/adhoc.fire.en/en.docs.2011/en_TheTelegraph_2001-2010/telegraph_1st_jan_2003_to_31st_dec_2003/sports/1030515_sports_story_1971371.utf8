 Juventus topple Real to reach final
 Turin: It will be an all-Italian affair in the final of the Champions League in Manchester on May 28. After AC Milan did it Tuesday, Juventus knocked out holders Real Madrid of Spain 3-1 in the second-leg of their semi-final (4-3 on aggregate) to make the final.Pavel Nedved made it 3-0 for the Italian outfit in the 73rd minute when he took a powerful volley following a superb overhead through from the midfield.Zinedine Zidane pulled one back for Real in the dying stages, but then it was too late.Reals cause was not helped either, when Luis Figo missed a penalty midway through the second session.Earlier, goals from David Trezeguet and Alessandro Del Piero put holders Real Madrid in the red in the first session. Trezeguet began the move that led to his goal by heading into the path of Nedved and the Czechs deep cross from the right was headed down by Del Piero back to the Frenchman who did well to turn the ball in from a tight angle.Two minutes before the break Juve doubled their lead when Del Piero made some space for himself on the edge of the area and beat Iker Casillas with a well-placed low shot into the corner of the net. Real started off with World Player of the Year Ronaldo on the substitutes bench, but he had to be brought on in the second session. The Brazilian had been struggling with a calf injury he picked up in the first-leg .  Copyright

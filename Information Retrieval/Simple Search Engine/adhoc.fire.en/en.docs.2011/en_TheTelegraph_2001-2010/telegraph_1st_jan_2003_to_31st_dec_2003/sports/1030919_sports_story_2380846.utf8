 Federer ready for Aussies
 Australian No.2 Mark Philippoussis with Switzerlands No.1 Roger Federer at the draw for their Davis Cup semi-final in Melbourne on Thursday. (AFP) Melbourne: Wimbledon champion Roger Federer is gearing up for three days of action in Switzerlands Davis Cup semi-final against Australia this weekend with two tough singles matches either side of a doubles encounter. The world No. 3 starts his busy schedule in the second singles rubber on Friday against Mark Philippoussis in a rematch of their Wimbledon final. In Thursdays draw, former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt learned that he would open the tie against world No. 127 Michel Kratochvil in the afternoon, before Federer and Philippoussis face off renew their rivalry. Federer said he was not concerned with the workload, which concludes with a reverse singles rubber against Hewitt on Sunday, before Philippoussis takes on Kratochvil. On Saturday, Wayne Arthurs will partner Todd Woodbridge against Federer and Swiss captain Marc Rosset. In the other semi-final, world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero will lead off the Spanish challenge to regain the Cup when he faces Argentinas Gaston Gaudio in the opening match in Malaga. Thursdays draw also matched Spanish No. 2 Carlos Moya against Mariano Zabaleta, while the teams experienced doubles pairing of Alex Corretja and Albert Costa will meet Lucas Arnold and Agustin Calleri on Saturday.

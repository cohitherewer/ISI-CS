The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leeds 750,000 winning goal
London: Mark Vidukas winning goal for Leeds United against Arsenal, which clinched the English Premiership for Manchester United cost the champions 750,000 ($1.2 million). Manchester United must pay the money to Leeds as part of Rio Ferdinands 30 million transfer from Elland Road to Old Trafford last year, the Daily Express said on Tuesday. Under the conditions of the contract, Manchester United agreed to pay a 750,000 bonus to Leeds every time Ferdinand helps them win the championship during his five-year contract. United secured the title last Sunday when Vidukas late matchwinner against Arsenal ended the London clubs hopes of overhauling Manchester. The small print also guarantees Leeds one million pounds every time Manchester United win the Champions League and 500,000 for every FA Cup triumph, up to four million pounds. Vidukas goal also helped Leeds avoid relegation  estimated these days to cost around 15 million in lost TV revenue and ticket sales  and staved off the threat of the club being put into administration. Leeds have debts of 78.9 million and may have to sell Viduka, fellow Australian Harry Kewell, goalkeeper Paul Robinson or striker Alan Smith to stay afloat. A year ago, the quartet might have raised 50 million  nearly two thirds of the debt.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Draw gets Kunte off the mark
Hastings: GM Abhijit Kunte opened his account with an easy draw against GM Jonathan Rowson of Scotland in the second round of the premier event of the Hastings International Chess Congress on Monday. Kunte, who suffered a shock defeat in the first round game against GM Mark Hebden of England, can now look forward to his third round clash with white pieces against top seed GM Vladimir Epishin of Russia. Hebden beat compatriot GM Stuart Conquest to shot into sole lead on two points from as many games. GM Vasilios Kotronias of Cyprus, IM Alexander Cherniaev of Russia and Epishin follow the leader half-a-point behind. Rowson and defending champion GM Peter Nielsen of Denmark have one each. British Open champion Kunte, youngest participant IM Kataryna Lahno of Ukraine and Conquest are next in the list with half-a-point each. English IM Daniel Gormally, who is yet to score, is at the bottom of the table. Seven rounds remain in this Category 13 tournament. Kunte had beaten Rowson in their last encounter at the British Championship and that might have played on the mind of the Scottish GM who played it safe despite having the advantage of making the first move.

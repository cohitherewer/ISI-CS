The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Conditioning camp starts today
Bangalore: The 13-day conditioning camp for Indias home series against New Zealand will start here on Thursday. Coach John Wright, physical trainer Gregory Allen King and physio Andrew Leipus will oversee the proceedings at the camp in the National Cricket Academy. The 36 probables would have an hour-long yoga session each day from 7.30 am. They will have training sessions in the morning and afternoon, chairman of the selection committee Brijesh Patel said on Wednesday. The camp, concluding on August 26, will focus purely on physical fitness, and the probables will only have nets in the second-phase of the camp starting September 1, Patel said. While India did reasonably well in the World Cup, there are certain areas where we need to do better, the coach said.  Wright said the camp would give an opportunity to the probables to interact with King for the first time.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, January 26, 2003 				 Spinners have a field day
				 	 Lahiri: Five for 24																								New Delhi, Jan. 25 (PTI): Day One of the Ranji Trophy tie between Delhi and Bengal turned out to be a field day for the bowlers.																								Delhis decision to bat first seemed imprudent as they were shot out for 164 in just 60.1 overs. By close, however, Bengal were 93 for five.																								Despite the thick grass, it was the spinners who proved to be the danger. Bengal off-spinner Sourasish Lahiri claimed five for 24 while left-arm spinner Utpal Chatterjee took two for 41.																								Delhis innings, started with a first ball dismissal of Akash Chopra, revolved around the 85-run partnership for the third wicket between Gautam Gambhir (43) and Mithun Minhas (41).

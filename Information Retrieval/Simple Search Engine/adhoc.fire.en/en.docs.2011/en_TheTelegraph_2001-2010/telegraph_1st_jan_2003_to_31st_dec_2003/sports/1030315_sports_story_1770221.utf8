 Kenya want Test status from 2005
Johannesburg: Kenya announced Friday they would press for Test status from 2005 after their team reached the World Cup semi-finals. Sharad Ghai, a senior Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) official, said: We will be asking that we be granted Test status from 2005. We do not want to rush, and we will use the time to put together infrastructure. Ghai said KCA officials would make their case at an ICC executive board meeting in Johannesburg coinciding with the end of the World Cup. He said the sport in Kenya was crying out for funding but that would not be possible without Test status. Bangladesh were the last team to be awarded Test status. They have not won a single Test. Kenya beat Bangladesh in the first round of the World Cup, before defeating Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe to become the first non-Test nation to reach the last four of the tournament. Test status, however, is not just based on results but on good venues and competitive domestic competitions. Ghai, reflecting on Bangladeshs problems at the top level, said Kenya were prepared to be patient. He added the Kenyan board had decided that the teams World Cup earnings, currently standing at around $500,000, would be shared exclusively among the 15-man squad  $33,333 per player. The KCA, he said, would not make any money from the tournament. We will be left out of pocket, Ghai said, adding Kenya would press the ICC for compensation because of New Zealands decision to forfeit their first-round World Cup match in Nairobi. The New Zealand forfeiture gave Kenya four points which helped them qualify for the second round. Ghai, however, said: They gave our country a bad name and the effects will linger for some time.

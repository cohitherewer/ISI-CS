		 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 5-game ban on Lehmann 
				 	 LEHMANN: To miss a Cup tie																								Adelaide, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Australias Darren Lehmann has been suspended for five ODIs for his racist outburst in a recent match with Sri Lanka, the ICC announced on Saturday.																								The batsman became the first player ever to be suspended for breaching the ICCs strict code of conduct on racial vilification during Wednesdays game in Brisbane.																								Match Referee Clive Lloyd said Lehmann could have been given an eight-match ban but received a lesser penalty because of his good record and because he had apologised to the Lankans.																								Darrens comments could be interpreted as deeply offensive and I do not think that we can condone such things in sport or life in general, Lloyd said.																								The Australian Cricket Boards chairman James Sutherland said Australia supported the ICC decision.																								It is important that all players not only know their formal code of behaviour responsibilities, but that they also fully understand that these are a reflection of community expectations, Sutherland said																								Lehmanns ban means he will miss the rest of the tri-series with Sri Lanka and England, and possibly Australias first World Cup game. He was found guilty after a three-hour hearing in Adelaide on Saturday.																								The 32-year-old, reading from a prepared statement, said he would not appeal.																								I accept the penalty and would like to say once again how regretful I am, he said.																								Lehmann was reported after he was overheard making an offensive remark about the Sri Lankans when he was alone in the dressing room after being dismissed.																								He immediately apologised to the Lankans and provided a formal, written apology after the match.																								The Lankans said they had accepted Lehmanns apology and did not wish to pursue the matter, but the ICC decided to charge him anyway.																								The Sri Lankan coach Dav Whatmore told the hearing his players held Lehmann in high regard and did not want to see him suspended. 																								n Australian Open: Page 14																								n India out of SAFF Cup: Page 15

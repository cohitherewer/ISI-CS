 Stars demand inquiry into US drugs scam
London: Leading Olympic athletes, coaches and officials have called for an open investigation into allegations of a drugs cover-up by the United States, dating back to the 1988 Seoul Games. Documents released in the US earlier this week suggest that 19 Olympic medallists, including multiple champion Carl Lewis, failed drugs tests between 1988 and 2000, but were allowed to continue competing at top level. Lewis is said to have tested positive for three stimulants banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), including ephedrine, shortly before he was due to compete at the Seoul Olympics. He went on to claim the gold medal in one of the most famous races ever, the 100 m mens sprint final, after winner Ben Johnson was disqualified having tested positive for steroids. The US Olympic Committee (USOC) disqualified the athlete, but then accepted his appeal on the basis that he had taken an herbal supplement and was unaware of its contents. (Reuters)  Copyright

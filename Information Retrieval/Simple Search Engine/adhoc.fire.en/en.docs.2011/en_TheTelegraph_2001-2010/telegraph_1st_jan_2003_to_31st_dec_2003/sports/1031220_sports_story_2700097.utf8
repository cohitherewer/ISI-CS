 Wont be a softie to Sachin: Nel
 Nel wont give up aggression at any cost Durban: South African paceman Andre Nel may have apologised for his indecent gesture against an opposition batsman but was not willing to give up his aggressiveness at any cost.  Nel, who was recently fined for sticking his tongue out after dismissing Chris Gayle during the first Test between South Africa and the West Indies, said he would not allow the incident to curb his aggression as a bowler, particularly against the top batsmen of the world. Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara are the best batsmen I have ever bowled to and I dont want to appear as a softie in their eyes, Nel said.  Nel was fined 10,000 rand (approximately Rs 1.62 lakh) for sticking his tongue out against Gayle after he had the West Indian caught behind on the final day in Johannesburg. South Africa won the match to take a 1-0 lead in the five-Test series. Nel said he went to the West Indies dressing room to apologise to Gayle immediately after the test match. It was a stupid thing to do. I realised immediately that I had lost my head and I felt really bad about it. Im only human. Of course you get excited when you take a wicket, especially when representing your country, the South African said. I give it my best shot when Im playing for South Africa, and its perhaps inevitable that ones emotions would boil over at times. Nel was interviewed by several South African radio stations on the incident. I want to establish myself in the team now and Im grabbing every opportunity. Im delighted that I was able to prove that I can bowl fast, Nel said. I wont be half the bowler I am if I cant run in with aggression and let off steam in that way. We cricket players arent robots. But I realise that I have a responsibility to behave in such a way that I dont bring the game into disrepute. My aggression is my biggest asset, and I wont let the fine turn me into a softie on the playing field. Meanwhile, Nels mentors  former Test players Ray Jennings and Keppler Wessels  have said he was developing into a superb fast bowler and he should not be stifled. Andre Nel and aggressive bowling are synonymous. He likes to try and intimidate batsmen. He gets worked up by doing that and takes wickets as a result, said Jennings, now a coach for the eastern province cricket board.  No matter how much Brian Lara denies it, Nel gave him something to think about in the first Test. Brian was quick to duck under the short-pitched ball at times.  Wessels said: Nel should not lose his style by being stifled.  South African coach, Eric Simons, said they were helping Nel to use his aggressiveness without bringing the game into disrepute.

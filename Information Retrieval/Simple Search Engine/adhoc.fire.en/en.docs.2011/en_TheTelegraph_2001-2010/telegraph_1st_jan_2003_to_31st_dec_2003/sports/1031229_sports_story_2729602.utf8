The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mongia drags India home
 - ASIAN A CHAMPIONSHIP - Afridi misreads pitch on rain-curtailed day  BY DWAIPAYAN DATTA  MoM Mongia, who put on an all-round show, at the Eden on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: There werent any paper torches that generally accompany an Indian win in Calcutta. But a man with a gloomy heart lit up a murky Eden Gardens as the 50,000 returned home, cherishing another Indian triumph against Pakistan. Dinesh Mongia hasnt been considered for the one-day series in Australia, but it was his all-round effort that helped India edge out their arch rivals by four wickets in a rain-curtailed Kenstar Asian A Championship match on Sunday. Man of the Match Mongias unbeaten 48 (he also took two wickets for 19) saw Pakistan packed out of the tournament with seven points. India lead with 18 points and will take on Sri Lanka, who finished at 11, in the final on Tuesday. Thousands queued up for the tickets from early morning braving the chill, but their enthusiasm came close to a washout by the unseasonal rains that lashed the city. But the groundsmen worked hard to get the Eden ready for a 25-over game, once it stopped raining around 10:30 am. It was hard to explain why Shahid Afridi chose to bat after winning the toss, when the ball was doing so many things. His batsmen faltered, all out for 97, and the Indians stuttered and stumbled to the victory mark in 22.2 overs. It seemed Pakistan had eyed a total in the region of 150-175, but in the attempt, they had misread the nature of the wicket. Afridi was the first to depart, skying a Siddharth Trividi delivery in the first over, and the Pakistanis never recovered. None of the batsmen applied themselves and went for outrageous shots, throwing their wickets. Captain Hemang Badani, to everyones surprise, brought in Mongia as second change. Pakistan tried to take liberty against his part-time left-arm spin, thus losing two of their main batsmen  Mohammed Hafeez and Faisal Iqbal. The Indian pacers also did the right thing by pitching the ball up to extract the movement that was there in the wicket. Bangar (three for 23) was the most effective, getting the wickets of the dangerous looking Salman Butt (21) and the in-form Naveed Latif (1). Bilal Asad (23) tried to put up a fight in the later stages, but he ran out of partners. Mongia accompanied Gautam Gambhir at the top of the order, and the two, it seemed would run away with the match. The Pakistan paceman strove for extra pace in ideal conditions, but they lacked the direction that is so vital in a limited overs game. However, it was the extra pace of Mohammed Khalil that claimed Gambhir (16), but still it seemed India would canter home. But once Yuvraj Singh (12) got out with 46 more to get, there were the famous jitters that generally characterise an Indian chase against Pakistan. Badani (0), Bangar (0), Rohan Gavaskar (0) and Ajay Ratra (2) went back in the space of six runs, Junaid Zia (three for 12) being the wrecker-in-chief. Though Zias arm-action looks a little suspicious, his pace can be a handful for Pakistan in the future. But the visitors hopes were dashed by a calm and calculated Mongia and the experienced Sairaj Bahutule (8 not out) as the two took the Indians to the winning mark.  Copyright

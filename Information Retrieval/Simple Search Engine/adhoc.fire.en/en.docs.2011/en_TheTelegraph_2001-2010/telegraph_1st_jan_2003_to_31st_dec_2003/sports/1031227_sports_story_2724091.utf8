 - Premier League - Chelsea fall 2-4 on Boxing Day
 Arsenals Thierry Henry waves after scoring his second goal against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Highbury on Friday. (Reuters) London: Chelsea suffered a Christmas hangover on Friday as they suffered a 2-4 battering at London rivals Charlton Athletic. The defeat was especially costly for Claudio Ranieris team as title rivals Manchester United and Arsenal both won at home. Manchester United beat Everton 3-2 and Arsenal won 3-0 against bottom club Wolverhampton Wanderers. Nicky Butt volleyed United ahead after eight minutes. Gary Nevilles own goal levelled the score before Brazilian Kleberson restored Uniteds lead shortly before halftime. David Bellion scored his first league goal for the champions after 68 minutes before Duncan Ferguson pulled one back with a last-minute header. United now top the table with 43 points, one more than Arsenal with Chelsea third on 39 points. Chelsea fell behind in the first minute to Hermann Hreidarssons header. Although Ranieris side were soon level through John Terrys header, they never looked comfortable. Matt Holland restored Charltons lead with a thumping header from Jonatan Johanssons cross after 35 minutes and Johansson made it 3-1 just after the break, tapping in after some brilliant work by Paolo Di Canio. Jason Euell stunned Chelsea with a fourth after 53 minutes and Eidur Gudjohnsens goal was purely academic as Chelsea slid to their third league defeat. Arsenals Thierry Henry the chief tormentor for Wolves. The Frenchmans corner was turned in by Wolves defender Jody Craddock after 13 minutes and when he converted a pass from Patrick Vieira seven minutes later the Gunners were threatening to run riot. In the 89th minute Henry struck again with a low shot past Michael Oakes.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

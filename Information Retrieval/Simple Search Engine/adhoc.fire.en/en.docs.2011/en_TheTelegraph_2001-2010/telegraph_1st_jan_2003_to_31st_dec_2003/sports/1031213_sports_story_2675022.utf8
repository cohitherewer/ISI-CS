The Telegraph - Calcutta
 It will be difficult vs Porto: Alex
 Alex Ferguson Manchester: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson believes United face a difficult last-16 Champions League tie after being paired with Uefa Cup winners Porto in Fridays draw. I think it could be one of the more difficult draws, he said.They are a good side. Their home record is very impressive. It wont be an easy one but if you want to progress in this Cup youve got to beat the best teams, and I think they are one of the best teams. Meanwhile, Ferguson dismissed as nonsense claims that the Old Trafford board is split over his new contract. One newspaper report on Friday said the negotiations over Fergusons new deal had run into problems. I spoke to (communications director) Paddy (Harverson) and (chief executive) David Gill about that and of course its absolute rubbish, Ferguson said on Friday. Its apparently emanating out of Ireland. I dont know why, but its nonsense. David assured me of that this morning. There is no split in the board and things are going along fine. Ferguson remains confident that a new long-term contract will be signed shortly and is concentrating his efforts on winning Saturdays Manchester derby. Victory over Manchester City would take United back to the top of the Premier League, for a few hours at least. Last year they lost to Wigan before they beat us, so were taking nothing for granted, he said. The important thing for us is to make sure our form is good enough to win the match. I know what it means to our fans and I know what it means to Manchester City. This the real stuff of what history is made of, two great clubs from the one city coming against each other. I have always said over the years that Liverpool has been our most important fixture, historically, and I dont change that. But the Manchester City derby is a special day. (Reuters)  Copyright

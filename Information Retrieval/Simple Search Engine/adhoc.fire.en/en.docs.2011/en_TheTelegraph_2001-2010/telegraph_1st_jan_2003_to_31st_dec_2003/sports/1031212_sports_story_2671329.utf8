The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tempers frayed at Eden 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The cricket was exciting and tempers at Eden Gardens also hit a high pitch on Day 3 of the Bengal-Hyderabad Ranji Trophy duel on Thursday. A senior CAB official struggled to keep emotions in check following a couple of allegedly poor umpiring decisions and gave vent to his ire while speaking to Match Referee Narendra Baghtaria during lunch. Hyderabad captain Venkatapathy Raju, sitting out this match, later found some taunts from the crowd too hard to digest. CAB officials and Bengal players brought things under control. The CAB official told Baghtaria the umpiring has not been up to the mark and Bengal were at the receiving end. He was rather impolite while saying so, but the Match Referee kept listening and didnt protest. Even the Hyderabad camp admitted the caught behind decision against Shukla was incorrect.  Copyright

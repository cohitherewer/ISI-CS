The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Batting key to beating Aussies
 - Monday discharge a possibility for Sourav, who hopes to be fit for last two tri-series matches  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta, Oct. 25: A good luck bat (signed by the Prime Minister himself), SMS-facilitated messages, calls to Sourav Gangulys Sandton Sun suite... The lead-up to the March 23 World Cup final was, to say the least, extraordinary. Perhaps, it could only have been that way. Today, on the eve of the first India-Australia match after that final, the scenario is different: The Team India captain is recuperating in a nursing home and the messages, understandably, have a new theme: Get Well Soon. Of course, the bouquets havent stopped either  despite doctors banning flowers from Souravs suite  and quite a few well-wishers have been sending mithai boxes. In fact, because of Diwali, the odd dekchi of prasad has also come. Comforting, yes, but its terrible for a pro sportsman to be off the field. Injuries are part of sport, but its frustrating when an abscess is the villain. In any case, Souravs recovery (from two surgeries) has been slow but steady. The good thing, though, is that he is now saying Im better, instead of weakly declaring Im struggling. That alone has come as a huge relief to the First Family of Indian cricket and buddies like Joydeep Mukherjee, a former Bengal cricketer. At the moment, Im hoping to be fit for the last two games (November 12 and 15) of the tri-series, Sourav told The Telegraph this evening. To begin with, however, he must be discharged from Belle Vue. If all goes well, the doctors may recommend a Monday check-out. Their decision will be known tomorrow morning, after the first post-stitches dressing of the wound in Souravs left upper thigh. Late last night, there was a scare when a small boil surfaced not too far from the initial area of trouble. Thankfully, regular hot-compress seems to have done wonders. Having already spent eight days at the nursing home, Sourav is desperate to get out. He quipped: Look, now that Ive begun to fight with the nurses, its an indication that I must head home! Asked whether he had actually got over that World Cup final defeat, Sourav pondered and answered: Yeah... He wasnt very convincing, though  in itself not unusual, given the difference between being world champions and the runners-up. Looking to the match in Gwalior, Sourav said: If we bat well, well win... Really, batting is the key... Are the teams, this time, evenly balanced considering a string of key performers are absent, he replied: Going by the current XIVs, all three are placed evenly... The tournament, therefore, should be competitive. Will he be watching the game  Rahul Dravids biggest test as stand-in captain? I will, thats for sure, Sourav responded, indicating he will get back to making notes for the many India-Australia matches that lie ahead in 2003-2004.  Copyright

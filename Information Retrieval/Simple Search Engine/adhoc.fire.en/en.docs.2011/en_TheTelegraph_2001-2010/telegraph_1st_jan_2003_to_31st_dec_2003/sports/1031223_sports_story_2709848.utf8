The Telegraph - Calcutta
 National Rally set for comeback in 2004
 BY SUJIT BHAR  Gaurav Dalal after winning the national racing meet in Chennai on Sunday The National Rally Championship has been principally cleared by sponsors for a grand return next year, though some steep hurdles remain to be crossed before the demand of a level-playing field is addressed. JK Tyre managing director Raghupathy Singhania Sunday said in Chennai he wanted to see the rally circuit (proposed with nine events) back in business, but Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India president Vicky Chandhok said he thought only addressing the necessary pre-requisites would present a fair deal. Chandhoks dissatisfaction stems from the Motorsports Association of India-promoted Asia Pacific Rally Championship that concluded recently where the JK-FMSCI lobbys top racer was given a pre-race unfair deal. The rally, though will be good news for Indian motorsports enthusiasts, this being the first time after the acrimonious break-up that the two association will join hands, as would the top sponsors  JK Tyre, MRF, Maruti and Castrol, Indianoil et al. What is expceted, therefore, is the best fallout from the white flag deal what has recently been worked out under FIA supervision. We are all willing to work in promoting this sport, said Singhania, and basically I have no problem with any other tyre company getting as much mileage. The basic thing we have to guard against is overgrown egos. The details of the rally circuit are yet to be worked out and all this could be discussed in January. This could also open the acceptance and homologation of the Mistubishi Lancer for Indian rallying. The company has been known to have offered stripped down chassis for rallying at a discount. That could boost the system with 1.6 litre engines (an internationally accepted standard) making an entry. Chandhok has been instrumental in the peace deal, but now he is not so sure he can work this out with all parties accepting. MAI is the primary FIA-recognised authority in the country to give licence to four-wheeler rallies. The FMSCI retains the FIMs two-wheeler card. The deal allows joint logo certificates for events (because the Indian government recognises the FMSCI and not the MAI). Whatever Chandhok says, though, the deals should go through, and circumventing the legal hurdles will be the tightrope walk that the two heads  Chandhok and MAI chief Nazir Hoosein  will have to do. If the money is good, feels Singhania, the standard will bound to go up, one day to international levels. At this point JK Tyre spends around Rs 4 crore a year on promotion of this sport. Meanwhile, Narain Karthikeyan looks a trifle depressed even after a successful trial with Minardi recently. Team Minardi has selected a new driver for the year [as reported by Reuters from Budapest Monday], in Hungarian Zsolt Baumgartner, whose government has promised no less than $ 4 million for the drivers entry into the fray. India may be crying hoarse for the slot, but it would be difficult to have any level of sponsorship pushing in that much money to back a single driver. I am hoping against hope that the Tatas (his main sponsors) and other sponsors get together to allow me a headway of at least $ 2 million, Narain told The Telegraph in Chennai Sunday. I believe that if ever India get a Formula One track and a race, it will not be before 2007-8. It will be too late for me then. I want this within the next three years.  Copyright

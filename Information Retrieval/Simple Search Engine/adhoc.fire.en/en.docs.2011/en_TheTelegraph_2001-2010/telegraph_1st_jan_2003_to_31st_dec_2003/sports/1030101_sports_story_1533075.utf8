		 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Sourav sorry for Laxman
																								Christchurch: Indian captain Sourav Ganguly said he felt sorry for V.V.S. Laxman, who has been left out of the squad announced on Monday for the World Cup.																								Laxman is in New Zealand with the Indian side that lost the Test series 0-2 and is trailing 0-2 in the seven match one-day series, along with another dropped player, fast bowler Rakesh Patel.																								Sourav told reporters on the eve of Wednesdays third one-dayer, that he was happy with Indias World Cup side but expressed disappointment for Laxman and Patel.																								It is sad that Laxman and Rakesh Patel have missed out because they have been part of us, but there is always a tomorrow.																								They are both young guys, but I feel for them because I know how it feels to be left out of a side, but we had to pick the best possible 15, Sourav said.																								Laxman has had four scores under 10 and two in the 20s as the under-performing Indian batting line-up failed to fire on their New Zealand tour. Patel, who only joined the side for the one-day series, has yet to play a match. (REUTERS)

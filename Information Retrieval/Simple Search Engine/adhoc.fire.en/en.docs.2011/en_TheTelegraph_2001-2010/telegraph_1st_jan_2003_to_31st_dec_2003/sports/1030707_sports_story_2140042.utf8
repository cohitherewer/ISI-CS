(AFP) London: Australian Todd Woodbridge clinched a record-equalling eighth mens doubles title at Wimbledon on Saturday when he and Swedens Jonas Bjorkman beat Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 (reported briefly in Sundays Late City edition). Woodbridge, who won six of those titles with former partner Mark Woodforde and one with Bjorkman last year, matched the record set by brothers Hugh and Reggie Doherty between 1897 and 1905. After losing the first set against Bhupathi and Mirnyi, the top seeds, Woodbridge and Bjorkman won a pivotal third set tie-break 7-4 and the fourth seeds went on to retain the title they won last year. Its beyond belief that I could do anything like this. I need a good partner to do it, but when I started out on my career I never thought I could achieve this, said Woodbridge. 			He now has 14 Grand Slam mens doubles titles to his name. The 32-year-old is third on the all-time list of mens doubles titles in the open era with 76, just one behind American John McEnroe and two behind Dutchman Tom Okker. McEnroe, who won four Wimbledon mens doubles titles with Peter Fleming and one with Michael Stich, has even suggested that if Woodbridge matches his mark of 77, the two should pair up to equal Okkers record. He is always joking about it, but knowing how competitive Mac is he is probably serious, Woodbridge said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

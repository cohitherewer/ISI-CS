 Kallis ruled out
London: South Africa batsman Jacques Kallis was ruled out of the first Test against England on Monday. Kallis has returned home to be with his father, who is suffering from lung cancer. South Africa media manager Gerald de Kock said: He is not in our plans for the first Test at least. There was a possibility that he would be on a flight today but thats now not going to happen. The first of five Tests starts on Thursday at Edgbaston. It might be a week, it might be a month. Hes being given as much time as he needs, De Kock added. The 27-year-old Kallis is South Africas in-form batsman, as well as a genuine allrounder. He hit back-to-back centuries during the just-concluded tri-series against England and Zimbabwe, averaging 109.66 during the tournament. (Reuters)  Copyright

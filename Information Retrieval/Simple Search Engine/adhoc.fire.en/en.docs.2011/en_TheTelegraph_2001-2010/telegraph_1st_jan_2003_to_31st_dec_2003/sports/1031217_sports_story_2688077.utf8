The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly promise a fight
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 		 Akeem will be Tollys trump cardCalcutta: Tollygunge Agragami coach Krishnendu Roy said on Tuesday that they will take on Mahindra United in the National Football League (NFL) for the pride of the Maidan. Mahindra is a big-budget team. All three other teams from here have suffered defeats in their hands. But that very fact will be our motivation tomorrow, Krishnendu said. Ive told my boys they should play their heart out, because Maidans pride is at stake, the former Indian defender added. While Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting lost the Mumbai outfit 1-2 and 3-4, respectively, in the NFL, East Bengal had to concede the Super Cup to David Booths team through tie-breaker. Tollygunge, incidentally, have so far remained undefeated in the NFL, playing out three draws in as many matches. Krishnendu, however, dropped enough hints that he would aim for another draw against Mahindra United. Three points are what every home team should aspire for, but well not go all out against Mahindra, he put it. He also indicated that there would be a switch from the teams 4-14-1 formation which helped draw with Mohun Bagan in the last match, to 4-4-2. Midfielder Amit Das has been ruled out through injury, but three foreigners  defenders Isiaka Awoyemi, Ebi Bar Bar and striker Akeem Abolanle  will be Krishnendus trump-cards against the fancied rivals. A lot depends on them (the three Nigerians). Akeem is always dangerous in the striking zone, but Bar Bar has also gelled well with Isiaka, the coach pointed out.  Copyright

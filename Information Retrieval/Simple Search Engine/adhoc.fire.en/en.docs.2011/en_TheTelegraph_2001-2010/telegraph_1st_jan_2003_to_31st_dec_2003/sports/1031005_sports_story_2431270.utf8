The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jyoti Randhawa slips, Arjun Atwal climbs
New Delhi, Oct. 4 (PTI): Indias Jyoti Randhawa and Arjun Atwal met with contrasting fortunes Saturday in the $ 6 million WGC-American Express championship at the Crabapple course of Capital City Club in Woodstock, Atlanta. Randhawa had a terrible back nine and slumped to be tied 31st place at six-over 146 following a second-round seven-over 77 while Atwal had a much better round of two-over 72 and was tied 45th at eight-over 148, according to information reaching here. The two Indians are still in with a good chance of finishing among the top ten in the four-round restricted entry meet. On a day when the entire field struggled at the tough course, the combined scoring average being a whopping 74.07, world No. 1 Tiger Woods, however, shot a stunning round of four-under 66. On seven-under 133, Woods carded the lowest round of the day and was one of only five players who managed to break par. That gave him a five-stroke advantage over first-round leader Sergio Garcia, Rocco Mediate, Kj Choi, and Tim Herron, who were tied second at two-under 138 at the half way stage of the premier championship. Australian Stuart Appleby, who had the days second-best score of 68, and Spains Ignacio Garrido are tied for sixth on 139. After bogeys on the par-4 first and the par-5 fourth, Randhawa looked like pulling it back with back-to-back birdies on the fifth and sixth. However, those were the only birdies he hit under treacherous playing conditions as he came in with seven bogeys for his 77. Randhawa struggled to find fairways, hitting only five of them, and also made just six greens in regulation. Atwal climbed up 15 places from his overnight 60th position with a much more consistent round, spoiled only by two successive bogeys on the 15th and 16th holes. He started with a birdie and added another on the fifth. But the fourth and sixth saw him make the turn at even par.  Copyright

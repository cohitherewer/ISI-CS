The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vermeulen sent home
London: The Zimbabwe squad named on Monday for the forthcoming one-day tri-series with England and South Africa has five new faces. Four players from the squad which got thrashed by the hosts in the just-concluded Test series have been dropped while five new faces come in. The major name missing from the squad is Mark Vermeulen, who was thrown off the tour on Sunday for persistent misconduct. Mark had been warned about his conduct on a number of separate occasions during the tour but unfortunately has not heeded to that advice, said team manager Babu Meman. The final straw concerned an incident that took place at the end of play on Friday in the second Test. Mark ignored a management instruction to travel with the rest of the squad on the coach. Instead, he left the ground on his own, said Meman. Mluleki Nkala, Barney Rogers and Vusi Sibanda have also been dropped to make way for specialist limited overs players. Of the five new inclusions, Stuart Matsikenyeri played a minor role in Zimbabwes World Cup campaign earlier this year. The other newcomers are Gary Brent, Waddington Mwayenga, Charles Coventry and Richard Sims. THE SQUAD Heath Streak (captain), Tatenda Taibu, Dion Ebrahim, Grant Flower, Sean Ervine, Stuart Carlisle, Travis Friend, Andy Blignaut, Douglas Hondo, Ray Price, Douglas Marillier, Gary Brent, Waddington Mwayenga, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Charles Coventry, Richard Sims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 IMTA will fizzle out, says Woodbridge
 - Breakaway international body may  be launched next week WOODBRIDGE  Indian Wells: ATP Players  Council vice-president Todd Woodbridge says a proposed breakaway  International Mens Tennis Association (IMTA) will fizzle  out. They dont have enough support,  Woodbridge said at the Pacific Life Open on Tuesday following  a meeting of 16 of the top 20 mens players the previous  night. Its unlikely theyll get off  the ground because what they are proposing is already in  place. We already have representatives and if you dont  like them, you can vote in new ones and do it in the system  that you have. Basically, they are only asking to vote in  another players council. The proposed IMTA is headed by  South African Wayne Ferreira and Belgian Laurence Tieleman,  who have hired a New York law firm to represent them.  They are upset their voices are  not heard loudly enough in ATP decision-making and that  they do not know enough about the organisations finances. Were not trying to close down  the ATP, Ferreira said. We just want someone to represent  us who is not employed by the ATP. We want someone who does  what we tell him to do, rather than what the governing body  tells them to do.  But Woodbridge said the 16 players  at Mondays meeting, which was attended by ATP chief executive  officer Mark Miles, came out in favour of continuing to  work within the ATP structure. The only leading players absent  from the meeting were world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt, Andre  Agassi, Albert Costa and Alex Corretja. Agassi is injured and has left  Indian Wells, Players Council members Corretja and Costa  felt they were already informed enough and did not have  to attend while Hewitt told Woodbridge he would prefer not  to attend meetings. They were 100 per cent behind  where the ATP Tour is heading right now in terms of the  issues Wayne and others have brought up, and with the leadership  thats in place, Woodbridge said. Ferreira has said the IMTA is  planning to launch during the Miami Masters next week. But  Woodbridge was sceptical. They might keep talking for another  month but I dont know whos going to back them, they need  to have funds, Woodbridge said. Are the players who they  sign going to give them 10 or 20 grand each? Who are they  going to employ? They have to have staff. Its not just  saying you are going to do it.  Woodbridge believes the players  began to grow dissatisfied after the ATP was forced to eliminate  its $10 million bonus pool this year due to lack of funds.  The bonus pool paid players based on their rankings and  appearances at Masters Series events.  Tennis and the whole world economy  in general has to readjust and that created this interest,  Woodbridge said.The tour had been rosy for 10 years and  then hit a bump in the road. Its exactly like the information  technology boom, when that bust and everyone said, what  am I going to do? Guys in the locker room are talking  and thats great. They want to know whats going on and  they will become unified to solve problems. The ATP board of directors is  composed of seven members, three representatives from the  Players Council, three tournament directors and Miles. But the players representatives   Ricardo Acioly, Tomas Carbonell and Gary Muller  are  paid by the ATP to be on the board, which does not sit well  with Ferreira. The players need to be more informed  about the business and we need to have someone with a business  mentality to get valuable information for us so we know  whats going on inside, he said. Were a little bit isolated from  the ins and outs. We need an independent person representing  our needs. (REUTERS) Copyright

		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 CRICKET ONLINE - RAVI SHASTRI
				 One must keep setting goals 																										I am a right-handed batsman and often get caught while playing the glance against an off spinner. Please help.																										(Abhishek Bora, 10, Jorhat)																										Play with the bat close to the body and not away from it.																										I am a fast bowler and would like to know how to improve ones line and length. Will only constant practice at the nets help?																										(Dipankar Burman, 15, Dhupguri)																										Practice will be a big help as there is no substitute to it. Also keep your head still and watch the spot you want the ball to land closely.																										I am a medium pacer. What should be kept in mind while setting the field against a batsman?																										(Gaurav De, 15, Jalapiguri)																										Very important to know the line you are bowling and also the strengths and weaknesses of the batsman.																										I am a medium pacer. Everytime I try bowling a yorker, I end up with a full toss or an overpitched delivery. Please help.																										(Nitesh Lal, 14, Salt Lake)																										Again its a delivery that demands a lot of practice. Dont loose heart and keep watching the spot you want the ball to land.																										I am a left-hander and always face a lot of problems while taking on an off-spinner. Please help.																										(Sudhansu Sarkar, 26, Balasore)																										Watch the ball closely and get your footwork organised with the help of your coach.																										I am a medium pacer and end up bowling a good number of no balls in every match. Sessions at the nets and talking to my coach hasnt helped. What should I do?																										(Prabin Boraik, 18, Golaghat)																										Try something different. Try marking your run up with a ball of string. Once you get the right mark it shouldnt change at all because youve got to carry the string with you.																										I often get caught and bowled while attempting the straight drive. Why does this happen?																										(Vivek Dubey, 10, Calcutta-8)																										You are not getting to the pitch of the ball. Also you are lifting your head at the time of impact.																										I am a right-hander and often get caught behind or bowled while attempting the sweep. Is poor footwork the reason for this?																										(Sagnik Goswami, 15, Barasat)																										Yes, that could be the only reason. Also you are not meeting the ball at the right point.																										Does yoga help in improving ones concentration while batting?																										(Ramanuj Dutta, 17, Calcutta-4)																										Yes, it can be a big help to develop concentration.																										How can one improve on the mental strength so vital in todays cricket?																										(Pradip Roy, 22, Calcutta-10)																										Keep setting yourself goals. Keep thinking positive and keep working hard on your physical fitness. Also ensure that you must believe in your own ability.

 Vijai has money title in sight
 Singh has moved ahead of Woods in the third round Houston: Vijai Singh moved ahead of world number one Tiger Woods Saturday in the third round of the Tour Championship, all but guaranteeing the Fijian the PGA Tour money title for 2003. But overshadowing the battle between Woods and Singh was 29-year-old Chad Campbell who, winless after two seasons on tour, jumped to the top of the field with a 10-under 61 that left him on 13-under 200 That left him a shot ahead of Charles Howell III with South Africas Retief Goosen and Chris Riley sharing third place on 203. Five shots off the pace at the beginning of the day, Campbell had nine birdies, an eagle and one bogey in his round to end the day with a one-shot lead. I came out and hit a lot of good shots and made definitely more than my fair share of putts, Campbell said. I felt like I hit the shots the first two days but just didnt make the putts. I chipped in today and made a long putt. Stuff like that just tells you that it is your day. In the two-way fight for the tour money title, Singh hit a four-under-par 67 in the third round to finish on five-under 208, three shots ahead of Woods who managed only an even-par 71. The only way in which Woods could have claimed his fifth straight money title was to have won this event with Singh finishing fourth or worse, but Woods now trails Campbell by 11 shots with 18 holes remaining. If I had made my normal amount of putts I would have a chance tomorrow, Woods said. But obviously Im pretty far back now. Woods immediately lost ground with a bogey on the first hole. From that point he struggled to stay even par, with two birdies and one more bogey as he carded his third straight round in the 70s. I just wasnt quite swinging as well as I was the first two days, Woods said. When youre not feeling all that comfortable, its tough to get it in there close. With only one round to go, Singh looks to be assured of topping the money list for the first time in his 11-year career. After starting the tournament with a two-over-par 73, Singh has clawed his way back to ninth place, eight shots behind Campbell. Im in great position unless something odd happens, Singh said of the money title race. I think Ive secured it. The Player of the Year award is still up for grabs with Woods, Singh and Davis Love III all in the frame. Love is tied for seventh after the third round of the Tour Championship on 207. The award is decided voting by the players, and the results will be announced in early December. Campbell has made his mark on the PGA Tour this season, finishing second in the PGA Championship at Oak Hill and earning total prize money of $ 2,832,064, which ranks him ninth on the order of merit. The 24-year-old American, however, is not satisfied with close-calls or the money. I just want to win, he told reporters after recording a 13-under-par aggregate of 200. (Reuters)  Copyright

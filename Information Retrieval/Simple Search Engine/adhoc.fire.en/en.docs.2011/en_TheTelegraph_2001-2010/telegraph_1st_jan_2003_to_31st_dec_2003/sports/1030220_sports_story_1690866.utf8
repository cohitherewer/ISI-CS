The Telegraph - Calcutta
 An arm to wrist compromise
Andy, Olonga carry on mourning death of democracy in Zimbabwe  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Andy Flower wears a black wristband in protest during the match against India Wednesday Harare: Andy Flower and Henry Olonga again cocked a snook at the Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU), of which President Robert Mugabe is patron, but compromised somewhat by wearing black wristbands instead of armbands. However, they didnt issue a statement.Olonga, of course, didnt get much publicity  he was dropped for Wednesdays World Cup Pool A match versus India, a decision which did raise eyebrows. Andy, who wore the wristband nearer his right forearm, couldnt be missed.The duo is understood to have taken legal opinion before embarking on yet another move of protest, specifically mourning the death of democracy in Zimbabwe. Andys father William, a respected coach, has also been advising.For now, though, the ZCU has chosen not to react. Weve seen the wristbands and the chairman (Peter Chingoka) and I have had a discussion. At the same time, we need to get a feedback from others in the ZCU. Perhaps, we will have something to say Thursday, informed managing director Vince Hogg.Speaking to The Telegraph at the Harare Sports Club, Hogg revealed both Andy and Olonga have already been sent letters by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and that the ZCU was happy with its approach. Basically, the ICC has said the sport ought not to be used to further political ends.The World Cups Event Technical Committee, however, declined to act against Andy and Olonga (after the Namibia incident) but publicly requested them to stop wearing black armbands. Both had vowed to continue with the armband-protest.The Committee came into the picture after the ZCU, in a tactical move, placed the matter at its door.As reported in these columns, the ZCU didnt act itself as any form of disciplining would have invited even more negative publicity. Moreover, the Andy-Olonga mission would surely have got bigger mileage.While a black wristband isnt quite the same as an armband, it still is a protest and the ZCU will probably have to act now. Thus far, its game plan has been to lie low till either the World Cup gets over or Zimbabwes challenge ends.Incidentally, Mugabes presidential mansion is across the road from the Harare SC. It couldnt be confirmed, but the move by a couple of fans to flaunt pro Andy and Olonga banners,  Copyright

																								Melbourne: The Australian team will soon meet the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) officials amid speculation that its World Cup match in Zimbabwe next month would not go ahead.																								Captain Ricky Ponting said none of his teammates had yet approached him with concerns about playing in the strife-torn African nation.																								That may happen today, Im sure a lot of the players who have got problems and concerns will air those today, he said.																								There have been no individuals that have come to me with any great concerns so far, so hopefully that doesnt have to happen.																								The ACB is in favour of the February 24 match going ahead in Zimbabwe, as is the International Cricket Council.																								But Englands Professional Cricketers Association on Monday made an urgent request on behalf of the England players for their match against Zimbabwe on February 13 to be shifted from Harare to South Africa.																								Australian vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said last night at the Allan Border Medal evening here that the Australians needed to reassess their position in light of the developments in England.																								Its really hard to comment because were trying to learn and be informed about what the scenario is, Gilchrist said.																								Well learn a bit more about it but I think its fair to say that theres enough interest in it and enough concern from the player group to warrant assessing it again.																								Ponting said the players had full faith in the ACB to act in the teams best interests.																								Theyve done a fantastic job with keeping us up to date with whats going on in Zimbabwe, he said.																								Weve got total trust in the ACB. What theyve done over the last couple of years has been fantastic as far as player safety is concerned, so weve got no reason to be nervous.  (AGENCIES)

				 																																	Bogota: Former Colombia captain Carlos Valderrama announced his retirement from the game on Saturday at the age of 41.				 																																	The number 10 famous for his deft touches, superb ball control, apparently lazy style and easily distinguished by his mop of hair, decided to call quits after failing to agree terms for a swansong with his hometown club Union Magdalena.				 																																	The time has come to say goodbye and thank everyone who helped me in my sporting career, said Valderrama, who played for his country at the 1990, 1994 and 1998 World Cups and was voted South American Footballer of the Year in 1987 and 1993.				 																																	The time has come for me to go, to say goodbye and I do so with all the tranquility in the world, he told Caracol television, adding that he intended to continue in football as a coach.				 																																	Valderrama, born in the Caribbean port of Santa Marta and nicknamed El Pibe (The Boy), started out with Magdalena.

My batting hasnt changed - its still the same sort of thing, the only change is in your head really, symonds said. His innings was ended by a brilliant running catch in the deep by quinton friend, who ran from long-off to long-on to take the chance off Bojes bowling.				 																																	Boje finished with four for 55.				 																																	London: Sunderland became the first side relegated from the English Premier League on Saturday.

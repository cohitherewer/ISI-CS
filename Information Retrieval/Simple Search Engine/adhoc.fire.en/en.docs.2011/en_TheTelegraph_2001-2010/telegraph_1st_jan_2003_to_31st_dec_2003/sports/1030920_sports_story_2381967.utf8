 Pakistan drop Junaid Zia
Rawalpindi: The national selectors dropped the son of PCB chairman Tauqir Zia from the squad for Sundays final ODI against Bangladesh in Karachi. The 19-year-old Junaid Zia was a controversial choice in the first place. The selectors picked him ignoring the claims of several more notable performers for the first one-day match in Multan on September 9 and retained him for the next three games. Uncapped pacer Abdul Rauf has been included. (AFP)  Copyright

 AIFF clears Bhaichung for Perak
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The All India Football Federation has cleared Bhaichung Bhutia to play for Perak FC in Malaysia. It was learnt that the AIFF has issued the International Transfer Certificate for the player, who was contacted by the Malaysian club for a two-month stint following his performance in the ASEAN Club Championship in Indonesia. Complications arose when the Fifa informed that a loan is permissible for a minimum of six months, but the AIFF requested for an exemption of the rule. But the player was given the ITC on Wednesday following Fifas clearance. East Bengal have taken a wait-and-watch policy on the issue of the release.  Copyright

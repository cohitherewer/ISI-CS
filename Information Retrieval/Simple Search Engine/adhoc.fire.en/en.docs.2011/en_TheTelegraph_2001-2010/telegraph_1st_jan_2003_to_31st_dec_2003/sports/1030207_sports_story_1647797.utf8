The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassi hopeful of doubles tie
San Francisco: Although Andre Agassi isnt making great progress in his attempt to convince wife Steffi Graf to join him for mixed doubles at the French Open, he remains optimistic. Agassi said after winning the Australian Open last month that he wanted Graf to come out of retirement for the French Open in May. Her reaction so far has been less than enthusiastic. Its gone from her looking at me with daggers to Im just going to ignore you for a while, Agassi said Wednesday. Ive made progress, and somewhere along the line Im going to get her over the hump. Agassi said midway through the Australian Open that if he won hed try to convince Graf to be his partner in Paris. But apparently he never told her of his plan in advance.  (AP)  Copyright

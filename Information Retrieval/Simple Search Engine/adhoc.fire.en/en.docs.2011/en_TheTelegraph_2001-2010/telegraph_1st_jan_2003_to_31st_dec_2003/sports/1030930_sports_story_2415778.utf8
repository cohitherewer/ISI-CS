The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Over to Suzukas home stretch
 - Michael Schumacher: We just need one point basically. But you never know...  Michael Schumacher sprays the bubbly after winning the US Grand Prix on Sunday. (Reuters) Indianapolis: Michael Schumacher arrived in the US looking for a Formula One showdown and he left on Sunday with one rivals title hopes dead and buried and anothers barely alive.  The Ferrari hot shot must wait two more weeks for his unprecedented sixth crown but his US Grand Prix win killed off the challenge of Williams swashbuckling Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya. Only Finlands Kimi Raikkonen, 11 years the Germans junior, remained a potential danger as Formula Ones closest championship duel in years suddenly looked like a foregone conclusion. One point is all Schumacher needs. We still have a chance in Japan but its more difficult now, 23-year-old Raikkonen told reporters. Schumacher has won for the last three years in Suzuka and will again be favourite on October 12. He has 92 points to Raikkonens 83. Ferrari also regained the lead in the Constructors Championship, although that battle is far closer with Williams three points behind and 18 at stake. Raikkonens McLaren team are now out of contention in third place. Schumacher refused to take anything for granted, even though history clearly beckoned. Obviously, its a very good position for us to start the last race, he said. We just need one point basically. But you never know. It was just outstanding in Monza, he said, referring to his last win in Ferraris home race. This tops it again. Who knows what will be the next? Im just so delighted and happy about the way things have gone. If you see everything, the amount of pressure that is on is still there, although you handle it. Its just so beautiful when you get the result in like that. The irony of this most unpredictable of seasons is that Ferrari, whose runaway dominance last year led to a major rewriting of the rule book, are close to turning the clock back to where it was. Equally important, the luck that seemed to have deserted Schumacher had clearly returned.Tyres were critical and Bridgestone, outgunned by Michelin in the European heatwave, came into their element in the colder North American conditions. Suzuka, Bridgestones home track, is unlikely to offer Raikkonen as much of a chance as Indianapolis but his team were still ready to clutch at any straws. There is still a tiny chance to win the world championship and that means that we will continue to fight in the last round at Suzuka, said Mercedes motorsport boss Norbert Haug.

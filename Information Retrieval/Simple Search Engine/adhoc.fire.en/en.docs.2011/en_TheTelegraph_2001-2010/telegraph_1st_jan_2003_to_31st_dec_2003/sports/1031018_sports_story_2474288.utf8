The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Souravs quiet homecoming
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sourav Ganguly returns to the city on Friday evening. Picture by Pabitra Das Calcutta: It was an unusually quiet and low key homecoming for Sourav Ganguly on Friday evening. The herds of eager mediamen and over-protective policemen who normally welcome the India captain at the city airport were not around. In visible discomfort following a minor surgery near the groin region which ruled him out of the on-going second Test against New Zealand in Mohali, Sourav limped out of the airport in the company of father Chandi and former Bengal Ranji player Joydeep Mukherjee. Its too early to say whether I will be able to play the first few one-dayers, said Sourav, who has been provisionally named in the ODI squad for the first three games of the upcoming tri-series. It was learnt that Sourav will come under immediate medical attention in the city and the exact course of action will be charted out according to the situation. Never knew this would turn out to be this serious, the India skipper rued. I will have to see a doctor as soon as possible as the infected area needs to be attended to everyday, Sourav said later. Though the skipper is still non-committal about his chances of taking part in the early half of the tri-series, he appeared to be in obvious pain while walking out of the airport and an exceptionally speedy recovery is all that Sourav and his team can hope for.

(Reuters) Manchester: Jacques Kallis struck an unbeaten 82 Thursday following his consecutive weekend centuries to guide South Africa to a seven-wicket win over England in their tri-series clash at Old Trafford. Kallis was in prime form again after scoring 107 against England Saturday and an unbeaten 125 versus Zimbabwe on the following day. He added an unbeaten 145 for the fourth wicket with Jacques Rudolph (71 not out) as South Africa overhauled Englands 223 for seven with 15 balls to spare in the day-night match. South Africa made a faltering start with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith again failing. Gibbs was run out for one after Solanki dived full length and under-armed the ball on to the stumps at the non-strikers end while Smith was comprehensively bowled by James Anderson for 22. Andrew Hall, promoted to number three in place of Kallis, was bowled by Flintoff for 29, giving Kallis and Rudolph the chance to seize centrestage. Earlier, Marcus Trescothick had rescued England once again with a belligerent 60  his 14th one-day International half century  after England had been reduced to seven for two. Trescothick helped Anthony McGrath (52) add 114 for the third wicket before he was caught skying a sweep off part-time spinner Martin van Jaarsveld. McGrath was out shortly after reaching his first one-day 50 with four boundaries. England made an awful start on an overcast afternoon at Old Trafford with Vikram Solanki, who hit his maiden one-day century against South Africa at The Oval on Saturday, falling for four and captain Michael Vaughan succumbing for three. Both were caught-behind by Mark Boucher. Trescothick took successive driven fours off Makhaya Ntini and McGrath followed suit with two square cuts to the boundary from paceman Andrew Hall. Following Trescothicks dismissal in the 31st over, England slumped to 176 for seven before Chris Read (30 not out) and Ashley Giles (20 not out) added 47 from 35 balls in an unbroken partnership. Former captain Shaun Pollock an opening spell of seven overs for five runs with four maidens and took the wicket of England captain Michael Vaughan (3) at the start of the England innings. He finished with figures of 10-4-21-1. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Navratilova: Getting up everyday is an accomplishment
 Navratilova Villanova: Martina Navratilova wears loose-fitting shorts while other players wear skirts tighter than their racket strings. Navratilova is not as spry as she used to be and workouts take a greater toll on her body. Every day I get up, thats an accomplishment, sometimes more than you can imagine, Navratilova said, smiling. Maybe shes feeling her age  she turned 47 this month  but Navratilova is playing some of the best tennis of her career. This is no time to slow down, not when the Fed Cup and possibly the Olympics are on the horizon. Im playing a lot better. All the work that Ive done is paying off now, Navratilova said. It would be a shame to stop playing when Im just hitting my peak. This season, Navratilova won mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon and finished second in womens doubles at the US Open. Shes looking for another doubles title this week at the Advanta championships with partner Lisa Raymond. Unbelievable enough for her to be added by Billie Jean King to the US Fed Cup for the next round against Belgium on November 19 and 20 in Moscow. Navratilova considered the addition an honour, though she used her self-deprecating sense of humour to downplay the news. They kept going down the line and they finally came to me, she said. Im looking forward to hooking up with Billie Jean again and listen to her ranting and raving. (AP)  Copyright

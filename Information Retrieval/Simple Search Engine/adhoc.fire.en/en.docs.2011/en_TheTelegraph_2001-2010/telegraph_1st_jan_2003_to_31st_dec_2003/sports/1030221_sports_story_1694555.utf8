The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain doubtful vs Pakistan
Cape Town: England captain Nasser Hussain could miss Saturdays key match vs Pakistan here after his strained neck showed no signs of improving. Scans conducted did not reveal how serious the injury was, team officials said Thursday, but Hussains progress was being monitored closely. A final decision on whether Hussain will play was unlikely to be made before Saturday morning to give him sufficient time to recover. The 34-year-old opted out of Fridays match vs Namibia because of the injury and was replaced as captain by Alec Stewart. It was the first ODI Hussain missed in nearly two years, a run spanning 32 successive matches after he was rested for the penultimate match in the five-game series against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in 2000. Hussains continued absence would be a severe blow for England after Namibia gave them a fright despite the 55-run defeat. Having forfeited the Zimbabwe match, England must win at least two of their three key games against Pakistan, Australia and India to have a chance of qualifying for the Super Six.  (AFP)  Copyright

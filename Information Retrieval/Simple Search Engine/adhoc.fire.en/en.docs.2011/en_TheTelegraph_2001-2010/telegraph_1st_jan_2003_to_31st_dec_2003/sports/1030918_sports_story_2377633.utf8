The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA may not skip Pak venues
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Mumbai: The South African  cricketers misgivings over playing in Karachi and Peshawar  have, apparently, been set at rest after a security team  from that country visited Pakistan and reviewed everything  that has been put in place.  This was indicated late on Wednesday by the United  Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) chief executive, Gerald  Majola.  Theres a meeting with our players  on Thursday morning and, as of now, it seems we will play  at both venues. However, there wont be any confirmation  till an official announcement is made, Majola told The  Telegraph.  Copyright

 Federer dilemma over Juliette
 Federer joked the cows name will be changed only after talking to her in private Gstaad: After his Wimbledon triumph and a laborious opening round victory at the Swiss Open, Roger Federer turned his attention to more pressing matters on Wednesday  where to settle his new cow Juliette. Federer found himself in a quandary after Swiss Open tournament organisers honoured him with the tan and white Bernese Oberlander during a ceremony on Tuesday to celebrate his Wimbledon title. It was a nice surprise, but now I dont know where I am going to keep her, Federer said of his new 800-kg friend. May be it would be better to leave her in the mountains. She will be happier there than in the streets of Basel, he said, referring to his hometown in northern Switzerland. The 21-year-old Federer was also considering changing her name. During the ceremony, spectators were stamping their feet and chanting Wimbledon as a new name for the bewildered cow, grandly outfitted in a large bell and a bright garland of flowers. In fact, Juliette was the name written on the paper but may be I will choose another. I have to speak to her in private first, he joked. Organisers went all out in the welcome of their new hero, the first Swiss man to win a Grand Slam, flying Federer in from London on a private jet. During the welcome ceremony on Centre Court, they played Tina Turners Simply the Best as Federer stepped on to the court to a standing ovation. Former Australian champion Roy Emerson, a 12-time Grand Slam winner after whom the court in Gstaad is named, was also present to congratulate Federer. With his talent, I dont see why he could not win at Wimbledon again, said the 66-year-old Aussie, a five-time champion in Gstaad. In his first match on Tuesday, a tired Federer overcame Spanish qualifier Marc Lopez 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3.  (AP)  Copyright

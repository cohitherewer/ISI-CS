The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak pacers floor Namibia 
 Wasim Akram appeals for a leg-before decision against Namibia in Kimberley Sunday. He took five for 28 Kimberley: Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar ripped Namibia apart for just 84 to seal a crushing 171-run victory in World Cup group A on Sunday. Man-of-the-Match Akram captured five for 28 and Shoaib four for 46 as Namibia crumbled to the fourth lowest total in the tournaments history in reply to Pakistans 255 for nine. This isnt like any other game, its the World Cup, Wasim said later. You cant just take it easier against the so-called weaker teams, you have to treat every game seriously. Namibias innings lasted just 17.4 overs and 89 minutes, but it could have been even worse as they collapsed to 42 for nine before a partnership of 42 between Bjorn Kotze and Rudi van Vuuren doubled their total. The last-wicket pair prevented the African team from posting the lowest ever World Cup innings score, still Canadas 45 against England in 1979. Namibia lost five wickets in the first three overs, four batsmen made ducks and only three players reached double figures. Akram had Riaan Walters caught-behind in his first over, then Shoaib struck twice. Akram, playing a record 34th Cup match, removed Gavin Murgatroyd (4) and Louis Burger (0) in successive balls but missed out on a hattrick, a feat Shoaib also narrowly failed to achieve after dismissing Jan-Berry Burger and Gerrie Snyman. He blasted out Melt van Schoor (2) and Deon Kotze to complete his sixth five-wicket haul in one-day Internationals and edge to within two victims of becoming the first player to reach the magical 500 milestone. Shoaib, whose fastest delivery was timed at 159.1 kph, almost claimed a fifth victim himself when he bowled Bjorn Kotze with the total on 52, only to see the delivery called a no-ball. The African part-timers did well to restrict Pakistan. Saleem Elahi scored a patient 63 off 100 balls to spare his team the blushes as the Pakistan batsmen struggled to master a pedestrian Namibian attack.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

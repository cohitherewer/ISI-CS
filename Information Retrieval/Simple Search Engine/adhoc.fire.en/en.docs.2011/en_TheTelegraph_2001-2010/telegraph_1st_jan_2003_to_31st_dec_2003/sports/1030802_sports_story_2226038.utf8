 Ponting warns against taking shortcuts
 Ponting wants team to show more discipline Cairns: Ricky Ponting wants his world champion team to show more discipline and respect for the basics of one-day cricket when Australia take on Bangladesh in the first match of the one-day series on Saturday. He reminded his players on Friday of their sloppy attitude in losing three matches in a row at the end of the West Indies tour. That hurt a little bit, Ponting said of the 4-3 series win over the West Indies. We made mistakes in those three games that you havent seen this team make for a long time. We didnt respect the basics of the game and if you dont do that in one-day cricket its going to come back and bite you every time. Ponting said that while Bangladesh had improved in the Tests, the tourists could be tested in the one-dayers. He said the likes of Hannan Sarkar, whose patient attitude typified the effort of the Bangladeshis in the Cairns Test, would need to play differently.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Friday, July 04, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Mohun Bagans Brazilian duo Jose Ramirez Barreto and Marcos Perreira will be available for Saturdays Super Division Derby, but East Bengals Mike Okoro and Douglas de Silva look uncertain.				 																																																	Marcos transfer (and release letter) papers arrived Thursday.				 																																																	While the Brazilians will complete the signature formalities Friday, Douglas will reach the city on the same day, which reduces his chances of getting used to conditions. Okoro will arrive only on Saturday, which virtually rules him out of the Derby. 				 																																																	Meanwhile, the two Brazilians carried out light work-outs Thursday morning under the watchful eyes of coach Alok Mukherjee. Neither of the two exerted himself and restricted practise to laps around the ground. 				 																																																	On the other hand, the sale of tickets for the derby has been brisk, said IFA secretary Subrata Dutta. In all, 88,000 tickets had been printed. 				 																																																	 SAIL had two players marched off in their CFL first division group A tie against Kalighat Thursday but still earned full points. Rashmohan Mallick was shown the red card by Minanshu Bhattacharya for a second booking after arguing with the referee. That was shortly after half-time. 				 																																																	Midway through the second half, Mintu Saha met the same fate, for a dangerous foul. Reduced to nine men, SAIL still managed to find the matchwinner when V. Lalchungmaiya scored five minutes from full time.				 																																																	 South Eastern Railway (SER) thrashed hosts Central Swimming Club 12-2 in the invitation waterpolo championship at Azad Hind Bagh Thursday. While Supratik Mondal netted three, Sanjay Jaiswal, Debabrata Mallik and Biswajit Das scored one each for the winners.				 																																																	In another match, Indian Life Saving Society (ILSS) overcame Rishra SC 13-8, with Sukdeb Banerjee and Pranab Das netting four each.				 																																																	 Eight teams will compete in the Ahiritola Youth Swimming Club-organised all-Bengal Arnika Plus waterpolo tournament to be organised from Tuesday. The final will come off on July 12.				 																																																	 Dhita Mahindra Public Institute beat Somra Durgacharan HS 4-0 in the Britannia-Anandabazar Cup inter-school football tournament Thursday. 				 																																																	Bappa Acharya, Amar Puri, Bharat Singh and Dayanath Kundu scored. Agarpara Mahajati Vidyapith defeated Laupala Kalpataru HS 3-0 with Shankar Oraon (2) and Debashish Bhowmick scoring.				 																																																	 Don Bosco will host the Patterson Memorial inter-school table tennis championship from July 10-14. Entries close Sunday.				 																																																	Meanwhile, the BTTA officials are peeved at the fact 17 Bengal players have been called for the ongoing national camp in the city without informing the state association. We have decided to write a letter to the TTFI seeking an explanation, a BTTA official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI set to appeal order
 - Abhijit Kale gets nod from Pune court; Drama likely in Cuttack  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to appeal against Pune district civil judge V.D. Kulkarnis order on the Abhijit Kale issue. According to The Telegraphs sources, a formal announcement is expected on Sunday, after the emergent working committee meeting in New Delhi. On Friday, judge Kulkarni placed a temporary injunction on the BCCI, restraining it from suspending Kale and thereby denying him opportunities in officially-conducted tournaments  including the Ranji Trophy. As the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) also figured in Kales suit, filed earlier this week, the state body has responded by asking him to head for Cuttack  venue of Maharashtras next Ranji game, from Monday  after appearing before BCCI commissioner D.V. Subba Rao in Visakhapatnam (on Saturday-Sunday). Kale has already missed the opening match, versus Saurashtra. Rao, it may be recalled, has summoned Kale and the two selectors (Pranab Roy and Kiran More) who have accused him of offering an inducement to facilitate a Team India comeback. A written complaint from Pranab and More, to BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, led to Kales suspension last Friday. The commissioner was appointed that very day. Look, well be guided by what the BCCI decides but, till a stand is taken, we must respect the courts order. Otherwise, we risk being charged with contempt Therefore, Ive asked Kale to proceed to Cuttack from Visakhapatnam, informed MCA chairman Balasaheb Thorve, speaking exclusively. Even if Kale gets to play against Orissa  and he certainly can, till the BCCI obtains a stay  his appearance in later games is set to be challenged. As a source put it: Its unlikely that the controversy will end with the Cuttack match Given that the MCA will be guided entirely by the BCCI, its expected that the state body too will go in appeal. In fact, this was strongly indicated by MCA lawyer Girish Shinde, when contacted shortly after judge Kulkarnis order. Had Kale not moved court, the suspension could have been effective for a maximum of six-and-half months  by when the BCCI is obliged to complete the commissioners hearings and the disciplinary committees decision-making. Meanwhile, a PTI report from Pune quoted Kale as saying I feel a bit relieved when asked to comment on the court order. Strong support from the Kapil Devs notwithstanding, the Maharashtra vice-captain probably realises his troubles are far from over.  Copyright

 Beenamol gets Rajiv Khel Ratna
 Beenamol pipped Anjali Bhagwat to the award New Delhi, Aug. 9 (PTI): Asian Games gold medallist K. M. Beenamol was selected for the countrys most prestigious sports award  the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna  on Saturday. The decision to name the middle-distance runner for the top honour was revealed by one of the members of the committee which met here on Saturday to prune the original list of nominees. The decision also put to rest the confusion over whether there would be two Khel Ratna awardees this year. Beenamol edged out ace shooter Anjali Bhagwat who was initially in the running after the committee recommended that the award be shared between them. Beenamol had an extraordinary 2002, winning two gold medals and a silver in the Busan Asian Games.  Copyright

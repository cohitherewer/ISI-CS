The Telegraph - Calcutta
 What counts is being honest with what I do, and being honest with myself: Dravid
 - Mistakes happen and its best to quickly get over that... You cant control the past, only the present and the future  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Melbourne: Today, if theres an Indian who needs no introduction, then its Rahul Dravid  hero of the Adelaide Test and more. Dravid, the Team India vice-captain, spoke to The Telegraph for about an hour in the lead-up to the third Test. The following are excerpts Q As a kid, what did you dream of? A (Grins) Varied from age to age... But, if something kept cropping up again and again, it was my wanting to be a cricketer. From narrowly missing out on the 1996 World Cup to emerging the most consistent batsman has been some journey... Actually, the past seven years have gone so quickly... There have been ups and downs, but Ive enjoyed this ride... Enjoyed the challenges. Youve gone through phases. Will you talk us through them? I was consistent in both forms in the first couple of years... In between, only for a brief period (1998) was I not a regular in the one-day side... Then, from the 1999 World Cup (461 runs), things really changed. Of course, there was a hiccup on the last tour of Australia, but the past couple of years have been good. How much of a difference did your exposure with Kent (2000) make? Little bit as a cricketer, but lots as a person... Being away from home for almost six months taught me a lot about myself... Made me a more confident person... As a cricketer, I got a feel of batting in conditions which changed dramatically. Moreover, I got a number of innings and, really, batting is something I enjoy. In Adelaide, you made the point about having put yourself under pressure on the 1999-2000 tour of Australia. Did you set a target which, as it turned out, added to the pressure? No, it wasnt strictly target-related... Looking back, I focussed more on the result rather than the process of batting well... Wanted to do X and Y things, without enjoying myself... I learnt from that experience... This time, Im taking one innings at a time and, so, am more relaxed. (After a pause) Ive had this attitude for a couple of years and its helping play good cricket. Will you elaborate? Its just that I focus more on the process of batting, of being better prepared... Instead of worrying about the result, I try to get into the right frame of mind. The result doesnt matter as long as Ive given it my best shot. To speak of a turning point, would it be our last tour of the West Indies (2001-2002)? Probably... Its been a good run from there... Not that Ive been doing anything different, but Ive been batting well from then on... I did gain in confidence from that trip (404 runs in Tests) and began to trust myself more. Ditto for the 2002 tour of England (602 runs in Tests). Everybody talks about self-belief. How would you describe it? Its about trusting your game, your abilities... Its possible that doubts crop up, yet thats the time to put aside the fears and doubts... Thats the time to back yourself, to trust whatever youve got... You cant, for example, go into a match doubting your technique. After all, its too late... By then, you should have sorted things out by extra hours at nets or whatever. Once a game begins, youve got to look at performing, not changing things. Being a No.3 batsman in Tests, youre ready as soon as the openers set out. What do you do while in the dressing room? I try and relax, keep a blank mind... I dont like expending too much mental energy as theres no point concentrating in the dressing room... That has to be done in the middle. So, Ill have a sip of water, walk around  to keep the legs going  if the partnership is long and chat once in a while to the guy next to me. Are you superstitious? Not particularly, but I put on the right pad first... Its something Ive been doing from the beginning. In Adelaide, collectively, you batted for five minutes short of 14 hours. Such concentration is exceptional... When the contest is of a high level and the opposition so strongly rated, concentrating for long hours isnt a problem... I enjoy being part of a top contest... I love competing and, clearly, you cant compete sitting inside. But, yes, being able to push body and mind through critical periods is important. As is switching on and off. Do you really ease off when in the off mode? Look, once the ball has been bowled or the over completed, you dont worry too much... Thats when you relax... Its back to being on when the bowler has begun to run in... Its back to peak concentration. Youve spoken about a contest which is of a high level. Well, how motivated will you be versus Bangladesh? The level of motivation doesnt change and my preparation wont be different. The point I was making is that concentrating becomes easier when top bowlers are at you all the time. At least, I havent had to struggle... Also, theres more enjoyment after such a battle. Your immediate thoughts when a mix-up led to Sourav Ganguly being run out (Adelaide, first innings)... I hate being involved... It was very disappointing, more so as Sourav had got a century in the first Test (Brisbane) and was in form... Specially when youre up against a big score (like 556), its important that every wicket is earned. Having said that, mistakes happen and its best to quickly get over that. It shouldnt reach a stage where youre so upset that you lose your own wicket. You cant control the past, only the present and the future. Whats the first thing V.V.S. Laxman (who replaced Sourav) and you tell each other? That we should fight... At that point, we didnt think of Australias 556... Our thoughts were on the next ball, the next over and the next session... Whenever weve batted together, weve looked at building on a small beginning, never aimed at a big goal. But, surely, theres something special between Laxman and you... (Laughs) We know each others game, know how to back and motivate each other. Its generally felt that the more you succeed, lesser the pressure on Sachin Tendulkar. Do you agree? Look, at the international level, you cant win on the strength of an individual performance... It has to be a team effort. Even in Adelaide, debutant Irfan Pathan got Matthew Hayden and Parthiv Patel scored useful runs in the first innings... Big or small, everybody has to make a contribution  and, they do. To win, seven or eight of the guys have to be at the top of their game. Usually, how do you prepare for a series overseas? There wasnt any time for this one... Much depends on the days available... I watch a bit of the bowlers footage, but not a lot as one plays so much and gets to see even more on the TV... Unless hes a rookie, theres little that is unknown about somebody. With an extensive support staff, has cricket become easier seven years after your debut? Definitely not easier, because other teams are improving with focussed planning. But, yes, cricket is better organised and more professional. Theres this appreciation that it isnt just about 11 people on the field, that much back-room work has to be done. (After a pause) Every generation has its fads and theories... Seven years on, things will perhaps be done differently. Youre the vice-captain. What makes this team gel? A combination of things... Were better organised, theres more planning... Weve got a better team ethic and culture... Everyone wants to do well for the team, for each other. Basically, theres better spirit... Also, some good cricketers have come together at the same time... Of course, I dont wish to belittle any of the players Ive played with in the earlier years... I cant think of many who didnt always give off their best. Have you, at 30, begun to peak? Dont know... All Ill say is that the experience of seven years is helping me in the present times... I hope to keep getting better, though. Is there something which drives you besides wanting to do well individually and collectively? I enjoy batting, enjoy the camaraderie... Probably, that also drives me on. Earlier this season, you captained in a Test (Mohali) and led in much of the tri-series. What was the experience like? I knew I was only standing-in for Sourav and, so, wasnt under that much pressure... It was challenging, a nice experience... Does captaincy seem easier from outside? But, when have I said its easy? You learn and, with time, can get better. Seven years have gone, but is missing a hundred on debut at Lords your No.1 regret? I cant change that 95 can I? At least a 95 is better than getting out on zero or... Today, I see that innings as a good start to my career... If anything, its a disappointment, not a regret. One has to move on... For instance, it would have been great had we won the last World Cup final  we didnt, despite our best effort, and must look ahead. Having established yourself as an indispensable member of the one-day XI must be cause for much satisfaction... Its just in the early part of my career that I wasnt a regular... Even that was an experience and I learned... Are you touchy about criticism? Dont get hassled... In any case, now, I handle it better... Having matured, I neither get too excited nor do I get upset. What counts is being honest with what I do and being honest with myself. (After a pause) Not everybody may have the right intentions and somebody could attribute motives to whatever you do... Equally, plenty of people are sensible... Ive grown to accept that. What will you tell an audience of young cricketers? Work hard, technically and in the mind... The more you get to know yourself, the better you will be as a cricketer. Moreover, the more honest, the better. Has it been difficult staying away from the family? (Grins again) Wasnt so earlier, but perhaps now is (after marriage)... Actually, theres a lifestyle which goes with cricket and I enjoy it. Touring helps you grow as a person and one should enjoy that part of being a cricketer. Youre fond of books... Thats one way of switching off... I like music too and chilling out with the boys. Have you been conscious about enjoying a clean image? Not particularly. I havent gone out of my way to live up to a certain image... I try to be the person I am, dont consciously try being a role model... In fact, I dont know whether the intensity I show on the field inspires somebody... Do you have a role model outside cricket? Not any one person... But, yes, my parents have been a huge inspiration... Ive tried to absorb a few things from some of the people whove made a mark... Essentially, Im a good learner... I dont have hang-ups. Sourav feels touring Australia, for example, helps him focus better as a million fans arent watching every step. Do you agree? I do... Im more relaxed overseas, away from all the hype and... The last question: Where do you see yourself five years from now? I never look that far ahead... For now, nothing is more important than the third Test... I take one step at a time... That way, Im comfortable.  Copyright

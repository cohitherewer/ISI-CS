(Reuters) Benoni: South Africa were thrown an unexpected World Cup lifeline when rain robbed the West Indies of a likely victory over Bangladesh in Group B on Tuesday.The West Indies were just starting to tighten the screws on Bangladesh when the heavens opened up and the match was abandoned without a result.Both teams were awarded two points, but the Caribbeans were the real losers as Bangladesh have not won a one-day International for four years.The result left West Indies still needing to win their remaining three matches to make the Super Sixes, while opening the door for hosts South Africa whose hopes had been left hanging by a thread when they lost two of their first three matches in the tournament.Its no more difficult for us than before, the important game for us is the game against Sri Lanka and may be this is a blessing in disguise, said West Indies skipper Carl HooperObviously we wanted the four points but we want to be in the sort of frame of mind when we play Sri Lanka to know that its a must-win situation.West Indies made 244 for nine after being put into bat before reducing Bangladesh to 32 for two in 8.1 overs.Ricardo Powell smashed a half-century off just 30 balls, the fastest of the tournament, to lift them to a good total. He clubbed four sixes and three fours.Bangla want KhanBangladesh are seeking permission to replace injured medium pacer Mashrafee Mortaza with former captain Akram Khan, team manager Abu Sharif Faruque said.

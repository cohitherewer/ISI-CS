The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dutts call evokes poor response
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Poor attendance marked Biswanath Dutts meeting with the Cricket Association of Bengals affiliated units on Wednesday evening. Only around 27 of the 122 affiliated clubs of the CAB attended. The current trustee board chairman and former CAB president was critical of the functioning of the body and also explained the reasons behind his decision to quit the Association. The trustee board has almost become defunct. It has no powers and functions of its own, Dutt told the gathering which included CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya. Dutt suggested overhauling the administrative structure with a two-tier system for smooth functioning, issuing fresh membership against those associate, annual and life members who have passed away. He also suggested the sale of a portion of Club House tickets during international engagements. Whatever has been raised is basically an internal administrative matter of the CAB which Im confident will be sorted out by the members themselves, Dalmiya said later.  Copyright

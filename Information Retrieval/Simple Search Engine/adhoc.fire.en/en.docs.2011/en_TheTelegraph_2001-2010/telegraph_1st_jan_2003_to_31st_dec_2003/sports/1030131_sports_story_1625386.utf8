		 Friday, January 31, 2003 				 Indians at home in Durban
																								Durban: If Sourav Gangulys men thought they would escape thronging crowds and the pressure of expectations in South Africa, they were proved wrong by the sheer number of fans who flocked to welcome them.																								At a function to welcome the Indians, deputy mayor of Durban Logie Naidoo, who is one among the 800,000 people of Indian origin living here, thanked them for choosing the city as their base for the initial stage of their World Cup campaign. Durban has a special connection with India, he said, adding he was sure the Indian team would feel at home.																								A section of the media, however, did not take kindly to the glum faces of the Indians as they disembarked from their flight, saying Harbhajan Singh was the only player who co-operated.  (PTI)

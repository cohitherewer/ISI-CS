The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I need the freedom to operate: Rameez
 - Top-level signals against PCB chief executive quitting  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Adelaide, Dec.13: The Pakistan Cricket Board  (PCB) chief executive, Rameez Raja, is undecided on whether  to continue or put in his papers with a change of guard  at the very top. Rameez was hand-picked by former chairman  Lt General Tauqir Zia in April, just weeks after Pakistans  quick exit from the World Cup. Frankly, my mind isnt made up...  Much depends on what is discussed at my meeting with the  new chairman (Shaharyar Khan)... Ill meet him later today  or tomorrow, Rameez told The Telegraph this afternoon. This latest crisis, of course, has been triggered by Gen. Zias own resignation on December 1. Shaharyar, a one-time foreign secretary and diplomat, is expected to reach Lahore (where the PCB is headquartered) by the evening. Incidentally, the Karachi-based Shaharyar was manager during Pakistans 1998-1999 tour of India and is related to former India captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi. He was the manager more recently as well, during this years World Cup. Rameez, an ex-captain by the way, added: Its a fact that I was given a free hand (by Gen. Zia) and, unless I have the same freedom, I wouldnt like to continue... Moreover, Ive got to be on the same wavelength as the new chairman, somebody I dont know... Without going into details, though, Rameez confirmed having received signals from those around the countrys supremo  General Pervez Musharraf, who is the PCBs patron  that he not quit. In key appointments, the patron has the final say. If Rameez does put in his papers, he could take to TV commentary in a much bigger way.  Meanwhile, Wasim Akram has declined to comment on  developments back home. I m not following whats been  happening and, therefore, wouldnt like to say anything,  he insisted. Akram is here on a commentary assignment.  Copyright

 Azhars case hearing begins
  Hyderabad: Arguments began Tuesday on a petition filed by former cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin in the city civil court seeking the setting aside of a life ban imposed on him by the cricket board for alleged involvement in match-fixing.Azharuddins counsel explained to the second additional chief judge the circumstances under which his client had filed the suit. The counsel pleaded that the BCCI had proceeded against Azharuddin with deep-rooted malice and prejudice. The counsel also claimed the inquiry against him conducted by K. Madhavan, former CBI director, was only as an eyewash. (PTI)  Copyright

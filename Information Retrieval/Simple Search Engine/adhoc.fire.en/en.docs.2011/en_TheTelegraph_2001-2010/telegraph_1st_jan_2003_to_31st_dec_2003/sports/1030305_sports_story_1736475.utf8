 Wessels hits out at SA selectors
Johannesburg: Former South Africa captain Kepler Wessels has criticised the composition of the World Cup squad in the wake of the teams dramatic exit from the tournament. We need to look at selection. The selectors missed it completely, said Wessels who was captain of the team that also lost out on the rain-rule in the 1992 semi-final against England in Sydney. They picked 11 guys to play in the important matches and four arbitrary players to play against Canada not understanding that in a tournament like this if one of your key players loses form, youve got to have someone to replace him. So when Allan Donald lost form they were down to Monde Zondeki or Charl Langeveldt. Former South Africa cricket chief Ali Bacher, now the World Cup supremo, had earlier given late sports minister Steve Tshwete a promise that five coloured players would be included in the 15-man squad. Chairman of selectors Omar Henrywas furious with Wessels. He must realise we are in South Africa. Were not in New Zealand, not in England, not in Australia. We have a unique situation, Henry said. Wessels also said poor preparation had cost the team dearly. When you start your innings, get the Duckworth-Lewis printout. (AFP)  Copyright

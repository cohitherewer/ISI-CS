The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, October 25, 2003  Colic claims 9 Bangalore horses 
 BY STAR RACER Arjun Karan Calcutta: Tragedy struck  trainer Arjun Mangalorkars stable in Bangalore on Thursday,  as seven of his well-bred horses, including two youngsters,  died of colic. Trainers Manohar and Karan Singh also lost  a horse each taking the toll to nine and sending alarm signals  in the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC). Though Mangalorkar was  not available for comment, sources in Bangalore said that  a total of 15 Mangalorkar-trainees were struck by the disease.  While seven survived, one is still battling for life.				 										According to a senior veterinarian, colic is a spasm, accompanied by pain in any soft or hollow organ  such as the abdomen. In horses, colic is broadly classified into three groups: intestinal dysfunctions, intestinal accidents and enteritis or ulcerations.Though the causes are wide-ranging, most colic cases fall under these groups, the veterinarian added.				 										Colic has always been a cause for concern in thoroughbred racing, claiming horses routinely. However,it is the first time that the disease has taken a toll on such a large scale. 				 										not only BTC, but the Maharaja Stud Farm and a city riding school have had casualities on the same day, BTC secretary Nirmal Prasad said over the telephone. We presume that grass by the roadside may have caused the problem and have sent samples for analysis. The post-mortem report is expected by Tuesday and only then will we know the real cause, Prasad added. The grass samples are being tested at the Agricultural University in Bangalore.

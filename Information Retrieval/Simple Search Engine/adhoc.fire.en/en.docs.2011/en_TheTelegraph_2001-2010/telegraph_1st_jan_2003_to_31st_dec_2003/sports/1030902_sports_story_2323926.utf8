The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sporting desperate 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Super Six stage of the CFL Super Division kicks off on Tuesday with a high-voltage clash between two National League teams: Mohammedan Sporting and Tollygunge Agragami. Tollygunge Agragami should have been going into this match on a real high, having beaten Mohammedan Sporting in their first-phase tie to third place. But with Subrata Bhattacharya suddenly going on medical leave, spirit is anything but sky-high. His (Subratas) letter is confusing He writes that he has been advised by his doctor complete bed rest for one- and-a-half months and then states that if he is considered again after a month, he could be back, Tollygunge secretary Mantoo Ghosh said. Subrata said: I am in no position to coach the team for at least a month, he said. Biswajit Das, the goalkeeper coach, will be in charge of the team till a decision is taken on the Subrata issue. Neither team is in the running for the top slot, but there is immense pressure on Mohammedan Sporting, after losing their last three matches. Its a very important game for us We have to go all out for a win, the coach said.  Copyright

 Baby boy for Marion, Tim
 For Marion Jones (seen here with partner Tim Montgomery), the baby is the greatest thing to have happened to her Durham (North Carolina): Triple Olympic champion Marion Jones has given birth to a boy named after her partner Tim Montgomery, the 100 metres world record holder, the proud couple announced on Sunday. Im so happy, said Jones, who won five medals at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. This is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. Hes a beautiful baby and Tim and I could not be more excited. Jones first baby was born at a North Carolina hospital at about 10pm local time on Saturday and, although weighing in at just five pounds 14 ounces, was healthy, the American couple said in a statement. Montgomery heard about Jones labour in the early hours of Sunday in Glasgow, where he was due to compete in an international meet for the United States against Britain and Russia, and was disappointed not to be at her side. We knew wed have a fast baby, but I didnt expect him to be this fast, said Montgomery, who is travelling back to North Carolina after his son arrived a few weeks early. The 28-year-old sprinter added: It was very stressful for me not be right there with Marion. We just didnt think hed come this soon. But Im relieved to know they are both doing very well and I cant wait to see them. The official due date was July 21 but the couple expected the child to be born earlier because athletes training through pregnancy tend to give birth ahead of the due date. Montgomery had decided not to run on Sunday and, instead, search for ways to fly home as quickly as possible. But after sharing her joyful news with Montgomery on the telephone, Jones encouraged him to run. Despite only getting an hours sleep, Montgomery finished second in the 100 metres behind Briton Dwain Chambers. Montgomery has pulled out of his clash with Olympic and world champion Maurice Greene in Lausanne on Tuesday. After taking the next few weeks to recuperate, Jones, 27, plans to return to the track in September to prepare for the defence of her Olympic titles at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chelsea draw 2-2
London, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Chelsea were held to a 2-2 home draw by their bogey team Blackburn Rovers on Saturday as the big-spending London club dropped their first points of the English Premier League season. Newcastle Uniteds miserable week continued when they lost 1-0 at home to Birmingham City while Mark Vidukas late goal helped Leeds United to a 3-2 win at unlucky Middlesbrough.  Fulham recorded a 3-0 win over a poor Tottenham Hotspur, their first win at White Hart Lane for 55 years. Liverpool beat local rivals Everton 3-0 at Goodison Park.  Copyright

 Pathan star of Indian win vs Pakistan in Lahore 
New Delhi: A fine allround performance by Irfan Pathan helped India clinch an exciting 10-run victory against Pakistan in the Asian under-19 tournament at the Gaddaffi Stadium in Lahore on Sunday. In the first match in Pakistan in six years between the two countries at any level, Man-of-the-Match Pathan scored an invaluable 28 off 38 balls in the closing stages of the innings to prop up Indias total. He then struck two vital blows in the first over to fashion Indias first win over their arch-rivals in the four-nation competition. After skittling out India for a none-too-formidable 148 in 38.2 overs, Pakistan themselves could manage no more than 138 in 34.2 overs, according to information received here. In the other match of the day, Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh by eight wickets. India take on Bangladesh while Pakistan play Sri Lanka on Tuesday. India had lost to the Sri Lankans by four wickets in their opening match on Friday. Pathan, who finished with figures of three for 23, removed opening batsman Khalid Latif and No. 3 Sohail Ahmed with the last two balls of his opening over. The tall left-arm seamer from Baroda failed to clinch the hattrick in his next over but cleaned up Khurram Manzoor off the second ball of that very over to leave Pakistan in complete disarray. Shahid Yousuf (27) and Salman Qadir (57 n.o.) added 55 runs for the sixth wicket before Riaz Afridi (27) shared a 58-run eighth wicket stand with Qadir. But Avinash Yadav took three quick wickets to hasten Pakistans end. V. R. Singh (three for 58) was the other bowler to make early inroads into the hosts batting line-up. The Indian innings was in a shambles after Afridi, captain Latif and Mansoor Amjad all scalped three wickets. Karnataka batsman Robin Uthappa (40) was the lone top-order batsman to make a substantial contribution. After Uthappa fell, with the score on 105, Pathans knock was crucial in prolonging the Indian innings. Singh also chipped in with a valuable, unbeaten 19. BRIEF SCORES India U-19: 148 in 38.2 ovs (Robin Uthappa 40, Irfan Pathan 28, Riaz Afridi 3/18, Khalid Latif 3/27, Mansoor Amjad 3/33). Pakistan U-19: 138 in 34.2 ovs (Salman Qadir 57 n.o., I.

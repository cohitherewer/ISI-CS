The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Movement towards bowling coach on the card
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: Sooner rather than later, perhaps, the Board will appoint a fast bowling coach for Team India. Of course, nothing has been finalised, but there could even be a formal request from the team management. According to The Telegraphs sources, Jawagal Srinaths retirement has left our attack both short on experience and guidance. Srinath was a mentor to some of the present quicks and, with his leaving the scene, the bowlers may find the going tough In other words, a coach/guide is needed, one of the sources explained. Of the quintet heading for Australia, Zaheer Khan is the most experienced (26 Tests), followed by Ajit Agarkar (16) and Ashish Nehra (13). Avishkar Salvi and Irfan Pathan are absolute rookies, though the former has played ODIs. Even if the Board doesnt make a long-term appointment straightaway, somebody like Wasim Akram could have a few sessions with the Nehras during the forthcoming tour. The former Pakistan captain, after all, will be in Australia as part of a commentary team. At the same time, options will be there should an ex-stalwarts guidance be necessary. Eventually, however, it may well be an Indian who will work alongside (overall) coach John Wright. Indeed, when the CVs are asked for, Srinath should be strongly placed.  Copyright

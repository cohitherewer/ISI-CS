 Sehwag off to a brisk start
London, May 17 (PTI): Keen to make up for his string of poor scores in four successive innings in his debut County season, explosive Indian batsman Virender Sehwag struck a quickfire 20-ball 32 before rain stalled play on the third day. Sehwag, playing for Leicestershire, unleashed some superb strokes in the four-day match against Surrey at The Oval Friday. In the 20 minutes of play that was possible in overcast conditions, Sehwag had no problems in seeing the ball in the gloom. His first scoring shot was an immaculately-timed straight driven four off Martin Bicknell. Bicknells next ball was struck powerfully through the covers and four overs later, the score had reached 32 for two with all the runs coming from Sehwags bat. Just then rain intervened and Leicestershire will now have the final day left to knock off 328 runs to avoid innings defeat with eight wickets in hand. BRIEF SCORES Leicestershire 200 amp; 32/2 (Sehwag 32 batting). Surrey 560/8 decl. (Mark Ramprakash 152, Ian Salisbury 101 n.o., A. D. Brown 73, A. Stewart 71). Match to continue.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Two from each XII for dope test, deems IDI
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Ganguly leads the Indian team at Saturdays opening ceremony. Any pair can be picked for random tests Cape Town: The International Cricket Councils business arm, the IDI Ltd, which is conducting World Cup 2003, has deemed that four players  two from each of the declared XIIs  will be tested for possible drug abuse after every match. According to a copy of the procedure for Doping Control, made available to The Telegraph, the quartet (plus two reserves) will be drawn by lots. Significantly, the rival managers will do the picking for the opponent team. The procedure, which is new to cricket, reads: 1. Doping Control Officers (DCOs) report 90 minutes before the match to organise the draw. 2. DCOs to notify IDI Event Co-ordinators that they are on site. 3. One hour before the match, the IDI Event Co-ordinator will accompany the assigned DCO to the dressing rooms where the team managers shall provide the Co-ordinator with the team sheet. 4. The DCO and the team managers will make their way to the Doping Control Room (DCR), located close to the players area, and the draw will be conducted to identify the players to be tested. The Event Assistant will take the team sheet and make a photocopy to return to the DCO after the draw. 5. One of the match officials t be at the draw to ensure its integrity  the Event Co-ordinator to fetch the Fourth Umpire from the match officials room to assist in this process. 6. The Lead DCO and one of the assistant DCOs will oversee the draw. 7. Neither the Event Co-ordinator nor the Event Assistant will be present during the draw. 8. The Event Co-ordinator will take no part in the testing procedures. 9. Team managers/representatives to verify that the players on the team sheet are the players selected. 10. The nominated 12 players for the match, by each team, will be entered in the draw. The cards will be numbered according to the players selected by the team management  1 to 12 as indicated on the team sheet. 11. The Lead DCO will verify with the team managers that all the numbers of the players on the team sheet are available, by displaying each set of cards, to the respective managers. 12. Two sets of cards will be made available and each team manager/representative will have the opportunity to draw the players for the opposing team. Two players plus one reserve will be drawn. The third card, drawn by each of the managers, will be labelled with an R. Each of the managers as well as the Fourth Umpire will sign the cards drawn on the reverse side. 13. Once the draw has been completed, the managers will be allowed to leave the DCR and the cards inverted to expose the numbers drawn. The Lead DCO and the Fourth Umpire will relate the numbers drawn with the programme/team sheet to check which players have been drawn to undergo the drug test. Once confirmed, the names will be documented on a competitor selection form by the Lead DCO. The Lead DCO and the Fourth Umpire will sign that form. Only the DCOs and the Fourth Umpire will know the names of the selected players. 14. At the end of the match, the DCO will notify the team managers of the identified players and then, immediately, the players themselves. The players will have one hour to present themselves at the DCR for testing. During this time, they will be free to attend any post-match commitments, but will always be accompanied (albeit discreetly) by DCOs, including inside the dressing rooms. All team managers and the Anti-Corruption Unit have been made aware of the protocols. 15. Once the players have been notified by the DCOs, they should report to the DCR where they have to wait until they are ready to pass a sample. Once the player has been notified, the DCO must be allowed access to all the areas that the player will be moving in. 16. The test will proceed when the players are ready to pass urine. While nothing has been left to chance, it wont surprise if the players arent amused by the shadowing bit.  Copyright

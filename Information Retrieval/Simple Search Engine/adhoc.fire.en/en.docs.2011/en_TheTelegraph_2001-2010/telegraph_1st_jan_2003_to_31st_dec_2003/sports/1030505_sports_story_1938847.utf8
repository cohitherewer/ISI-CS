The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Easy win for East Bengal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: East Bengal cruised to a 120-run win over CAB Presidents XI in the opening encounter of the P. Sen Memorial invitation trophy at Eden Gardens on Sunday. Batting first, East Bengal made 271 for six, thanks to half-centuries from Saikat Mukherjee, Safi Ahmed and Ajay Das. Humzi Ferozie (27) and Ajay gave East Bengal a good opening stand of 65. But the quickfire fifth-wicket stand between Safi and Saikat produced 100 runs, which provided the teams total a semblance of respect. The CAB outfit never looked confident in chasing. Barring the opening stand of 44, there wasnt any partnership of note as they were bundled out for 151. Prabir Mukherjee, Joydeep Mukherjee, Dharmendra Singh and Somen Karmakar took two wickets each. Meanwhile, Indian captain Sourav Ganguly visited the Eden for a short while. BRIEF SCORES: EB 271/6 in 50 ovs (Saikat Mukherjee 55, Safi Ahmed 54 n.o.; Uttam Josh 2/30, Priyankar Mukherjee 2/40). CAB Presidents XI 151 in 43.1 ovs (Priyankar Mukherjee 39; Prabir Mukherjee 2/21), Somen Karmakar 2/23). EB won by 120 runs.  Copyright

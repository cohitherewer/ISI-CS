The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arindam, Devang bolster Bengal 
 Arindam Das hit a gritty 117 Ahmedabad: Riding a scintillating ton by opener Arindam Das and a gritty 90 by captain Devang Gandhi, Bengal Friday gained a crucial 96-run lead over Gujarat on the second day of Elite group B Ranji Trophy match at Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera here. Resuming at the overnight score of 35 without loss, Bengal reached a total 275 for four at close with Arindam remaining unconquered on 117. The visitors were at one time reduced to 92 for three but Arinda, who has hit 14 boundaries so far, and Devang (90) put up a 161-run partnership for the fourth wicket before leg spinner Timil Patel got the better of the skipper. Gujarat bowlers failed to make inroads as the duo frustrated the otherwise disciplined attack, blending caution and aggression effectively and dispatching the loose deliveries to the fence. Devang slammed 10 boundaries and a six in his 162-ball knock, but was unfortunate not to get his century. A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: Meanwhile, Bengal are looking at a lead of around 250 to force an innings victory. Talking to The Telegraph, Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri said: We do not want to bat a second time in this game. A lead of 250 should really be handy. Ghavri in fact, still sees an outside chance for Bengal to qualify for the knock-out stage. If we can force five points here, and things go our way in the other matches, we might just be in with a chance, he said. Talking of Arindams innings, Ghavri said: He was a model of concentration. Well have a team meeting tomorrow and he will be asked to carry on and try to score 200 plus. The coach also had a word of praise for Devang. He also batted beautifully and the partnership between him and Arindam really worked well. Ghavri also added Shib Shankar Paul, who sustained an injury on match-eve, will need about seven days rest to be fully fit for the East Zone one-dayers next month. (PTI)  Copyright

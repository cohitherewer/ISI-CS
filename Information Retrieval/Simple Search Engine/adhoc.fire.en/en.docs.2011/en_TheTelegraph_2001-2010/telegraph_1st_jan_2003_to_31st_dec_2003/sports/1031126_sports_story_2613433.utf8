 Chambers tested positive for THG at world meet Paris: European 100m champion Dwain Chambers, already facing a two-year ban for doping, was named on Tuesday as one of the two athletes to have tested positive for the designer steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) at the Paris world championships.

The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) ordered all urine samples to be re-tested when the previously unheard-of THG was discovered. IAAF president Lamine Diack refused to confirm the two athletes were the positive cases as they were still waiting the B sample test results.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dravid ready to continue playing double role
 - Winning the series Down Under obviously the next goal, says vice-captain  Rahul Dravid at a press conference on Tuesday. (Reuters) Bangalore: India vice-captain Rahul Dravid, who kept wickets at this years World Cup, could don the gloves again in a one-day tri-series against Australia and New Zealand next month. The 30-year-old top-order batsman, who had agreed to take on the responsibility of makeshift keeper only until the World Cup in South Africa, said on Tuesday he was not averse to further duty behind the stumps if the team asked. Initially, the wicketkeeping idea was till the World Cup, Dravid said. But at the end of the day, well assess the situation based on whatever decision is taken by the team and the selectors. We have a good crop of young keepers and were hoping one of them steps up to the plate and does the job. But he added in case the youngsters failed to deliver, it would be a good idea to ask some other player to double up as a keeper. If the youngsters dont (perform) you need an alternative. And it need not be just me alone, it could be anybody, he said. Dravids main focus for the new season after a nine-month Test layoff for the Indian team, however, will be a two-Test series against New Zealand starting in Ahmedabad on October 8. Its almost eight months since we played a Test. Ill have to get back into that frame of mind. This week and the next month is really about that, he said. Talking about personal goals, Dravid said: Obviously, to win the series in Australia.... That would be fantastic. Dravid hit a purple patch with the bat last year, when he struck five of his 14 Test centuries and amassed 1357 runs at an average of 59. He scored three straight centuries in England, including a career-best 217 at The Oval, and followed them up with a ton against West Indies to become the fourth player after Everton Weekes, Australian Jack Fingleton and South African Alan Melville to score centuries in four consecutive Test innings. It was quite a good year, Dravid said. The England tour especially was good for me. We had a bit of an up and down series against West Indies when we lost the Tests and won the one-dayers. We then had a tough time in New Zealand but we picked it up in the World Cup. The veteran of 69 Tests, in which he has scored 5614 runs at 53.46, also had a successful run with Scotland in the domestic English one-day league in the last couple of months. Scotland was a good experience, very different from playing regular County cricket. It was good to be part of something which was new and unique for Scotland and theres a bit of the buzz happening around the place because theyre debutants. Dravid scored 600 runs in 11 matches at 66.66, easily outclassing the other Indians involved in the English domestic championships  Mohammed Kaif, Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag. He welcomed BCCIs move to arrange lectures by prominent personalities for the ongoing camp Prannoy Roys lecture yesterday was brilliant, he remarked. Dravid also indicated the graded payment system will soon be implemented by the BCCI and its just a question of getting the finer things in place. The BCCI is very positive and open. We have discussed the matter. It will take a little bit of time... Sooner rather than later, he said. It is just a question of getting finer things in place, he said, adding that the contract system will benefit both the players and the BCCI. Dravid sees it as a partnership between the BCCI and players. It will make the players feel that they are being taken care of by the BCCI and remind them about their responsibility towards the Board and the country.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

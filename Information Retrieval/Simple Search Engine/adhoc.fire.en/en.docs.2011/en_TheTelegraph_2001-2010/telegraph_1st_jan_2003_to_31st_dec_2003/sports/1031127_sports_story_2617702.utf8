The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, November 27, 2003  Network lifts HRC Cup 
 BY STAR RACER Merchant Network (C. Alford  up) winning the Hyderabad Race Club Cup at the RCTC  on Wednesday. Pictures by Kishor Roychowdhury  Calcutta: Dispelling doubts  about his sprinting abilities, the even-money favourite  Network easily claimed the 1,200m Hyderabad Race Club Cup  on Wednesday. Looking well-tuned for the event, the last  winters 2000 Guineas winner was hardly under pressure while  handing the lowly weighted Barrier Ridge a two-length-plus  beating. Trained by Vijay Singh, jockey C. Alford partnered  the four-year-old by Twist And Turn out of Net Net Net.  Earlier in the afternoon, an odds-on favourite Alexine had  delivered the goods for the jockey-trainer combinations.				 										However, their efforts to reel off a treble was foiled by trainer Daniel David and his stable-jockey Amyn Merchant in the Goolagong Cup when Dashing Chief scored a narrow victory over the favourite Arrayal. Latter in the day, a strongly fancied Blushing Queen triumphed for Daniel and Amyn in the Quincy Handicap. The other professional, who notched up a brace of wins in the seven-event card, was trainer Harvinder Singh Bath. Baths aged and trusted Rheinheart and Tequila Shot won their respective events.				 										RESULTS				 										1. Our Owen Handicap 2,000m: (5-6-4-3) Alexine (C.

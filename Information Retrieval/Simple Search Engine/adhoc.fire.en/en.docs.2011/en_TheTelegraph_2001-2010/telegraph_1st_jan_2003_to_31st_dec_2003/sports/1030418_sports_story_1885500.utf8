The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, April 18, 2003  RCTC CEO resigns 
 BY STAR RACER Vineet Verma				 										Calcutta: Vineet Verma, CEO, secretary RCTC put in his papers on Wednesday. Asked about the reasons behind such a shocking decision Verma said: Some unfulfilled dreams despite exploring all avenues to give them the fruitful shape have prompted the decision. 				 										Stewards of the club who called for an emergency meeting arising out of the serious development, are reported to have accepted Vermas resignation, on Thursday, albeit reluctantly. Verma has served three months notice and he may proceed on leave from July 1. 				 										Vrma, 44 years, is, however, yet to decide about his future course of action added: There are some offers locally and Im going to be around Calcutta, the city I love most.				 										Joining as management trainee in 1980, Verma worked his way up. The main secretarial responsibilities of RCTC befell on the young shoulders of Verma, in 1991, shortly after the financial scam broke out in the club that led to stepping down of the then chief steward, K. K. Duttagupta, and also sacking of some powerful members of senior managerial staff. His problems were further compounded after the detection of arrears to the tune of Rs 13 crore that was slapped by the state exchequer owing to mis-reading of the government circular about collection of taxes from the betting public.				 										Re-designated as CEO and secretary in 1995, the savvy Verma, over the years, has been handling all RCTC problems with tact and intelligence, including the wage agreements with the five separate, registered, trade unions in the club that has an employee strength of nearly 1,400. 				 										Most sought after in the countrys turf circuit for his innovative ideas, Verma served the Turf Authorities Of India (TAI) as secretary general during two separate terms representing the interests of the sport on national and international levels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Unimpressive win for South Africa
 Boeta Dippenaar tries an unorthodox shot during his knock of 80 against Canada Thursday East London: South Africa ground out an unimpressive 118-run victory over Canada in their World Cup group B match Thursday, keeping alive their hopes of qualifying for the Super Six stage. But the tournament hosts, who have to beat Sri Lanka in their final group game to have a chance of advancing to the next stage, dropped five catches as Canada, chasing 255 to win, finished on 136 for five after 50 overs. Fast bowler Makhaya Ntini (two for 19) was the pick of the South African attack, but left-handed opener Ishwar Maraj, dropped four times, anchored Canadas reply with an unbeaten 53 off 155 balls. He became only the eighth man to carry his bat through the full quota of overs in a World Cup innings, while his fifty, which included six fours in 148 balls, was the third achieved by a Canadian at this tournament. Earlier, Boeta Dippenaar rode his luck to rescue South Africa as Canada embarrassed the hosts with a determined bowling performance. Dippenaar made 80 as South Africa struggled to 254 for eight from their 50 overs after being put in. He was supported by opener Graeme Smith (63), the two putting up a 109-run fourth-wicket partnership. South Africa, though, made the worst possible start, crashing to 23 for three as debutant medium-pacer Ashish Patel (three for 41) picked up two early wickets. Patels 39-year-old strike partner Davis Joseph joined the party picking up Gary Kirsten for a duck.. Things got worse in the next over when Patel removed Jacques Kallis for one.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Every game is fun for me, says Bracken
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Change in action comes in handy for Bracken Calcutta: Nathan Bracken has been one of the finds of this tour, according to coach John Buchanan, and the young pacer attributes his success to a subtle change in his bowling action. As the bowler himself has put it, the interactions with John Reid, Geoff Lawson and Glenn McGrath before embarking on the tour and keeping their advice in mind, have helped his cause to a great extent. The wickets may be slow, but they respond very well to change of pace. However, I did have to bring in certain subtle changes in my bowling action and the way I bowl to suits the conditions, Bracken said after nets at the Eden Gardens on Sunday. In these conditions you cannot afford to bowl wides. You have to keep a tighter line and tend to bowl straighter than one normally does outside the subcontinent. Because, bad balls, which might fetch two or three runs elsewhere, is sure to be despatched onto the ropes in these conditions, he explained. Asked how confident he was of retaining his place in the side once the frontline bowlers are back in the side, Bracken said: I have no idea. I only play well, and leave the rest to the selectors. The new guys on this tour have enjoyed the responsibility. They have shown that they are good enough to hold the spots. On his strategy for Tuesdays tri-series final, Bracken said: We have to do the right thing at the right time. We have to hit the right areas and build up the pressure on them. Bracken said he considered bowling to Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, V. V. S. Laxman and Virender Sehwag as challenging. But basically, you have to get everyone out. So, bowling to all is challenging, he said. With 13 scalps on the tour so far, he is looking forward to performing against a full house at the Eden Gardens. Every game is fun for me. I play for fun and Im enjoying the tour. It will be fun to play India before a gathering of 100,000, he quipped.  Copyright

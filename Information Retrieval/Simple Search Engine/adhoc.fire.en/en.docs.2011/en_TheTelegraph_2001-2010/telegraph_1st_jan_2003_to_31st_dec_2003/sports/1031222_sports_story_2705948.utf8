The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bruce Reid likely to accompany team on Pakistan tour
 - Im confident Chopra will convert the good starts into big scores: Sourav Ganguly  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav is happy with Balajis performance Hobart: Bruce Reid, whose short-term contract as Team Indias bowling coach ends with the Sydney Test (January 2-6), is expected to again join the support staff during the tour of Pakistan from end February. Weve been speaking to Bruce and, well, he hasnt been unfavourably disposed towards being with us in Pakistan, captain Sourav Ganguly told The Telegraph on Sunday evening. He confirmed that Reids services (as of now) wouldnt be required in the forthcoming tri-series (January 9 -February 10). Sourav added: Of course, given that we will be playing two matches in Perth (where Reid is based), its possible that he will drop by and review the quicks progress. But, otherwise, there are no plans right now for a bowling coach to accompany the team during the tri-series. The games in Perth, where Reid runs a popular indoor facility, will be against Australia (February 1) and Zimbabwe (February 3). Meanwhile, Sourav said he was happy with the way Lakshmipathy Balaji bowled (three for 87) in the Australia A second innings and Akash Chopras application in both outings here. The match ended in a draw  the result couldnt have been otherwise as India were asked to chase 308 in 41 overs. Eventually, India finished on 66 for two, when the engagement was called off. Balaji hasnt bowled better on this tour and, really, gives us an option... As for Chopra, Im confident he will convert the good starts into big scores, Sourav remarked. Then, in a warm gesture, he praised the talented Michael Clarke for an unbeaten 131 (second innings): With Steve Waugh retiring, theres an opportunity to step in... We all know he is gifted... For his part, Clarke responded by saying: Jees, I dont think anybody can replace Steve... In any case, there are so many guys getting runs. But, yes, its nice to have got an unbeaten century versus India. Barring Sachin Tendulkar, who left for Melbourne on Sunday evening itself (to have extra hours with his family which arrived a day earlier), the rest of the Indian contingent heads for Melbourne on Monday morning. The third Test, at the MCG, begins on Friday.  Copyright

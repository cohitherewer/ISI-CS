The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Monday, September 15, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Loddekopinge (Sweden): Europes women golfers won back the Solheim Cup in crushing style on Sunday, Britains Catriona Matthew securing the point to seal victory over the US.				 																																	Matthew hit her approach to just five feet at the 17th to complete a 3 and 1 win over Rosie Jones, taking Europe to the winning total of 14 and-a-half at a sun-drenched Barseback Golf and Country Club.				 																																	Once Matthew had clinched Europes third victory in the meets eighth edition, the remaining four matches still out on the course were conceded, a point going to each leading team. That left Europe as winners by 17 and-a-half points to 10 and-a-half. 				 																																	London: Sebastian Coe, a double Olympic gold medallist in the early 1980s as a middle-distance runner for Britain, is set to become vice-chairman of Londons bid to win the 2012 Games, the Sunday Telegraph reported.				 																																	Olympic rowing champions Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent were named on Friday among board members for the bid under chairwoman Barbara Cassani but to the surprise of many, Coe was not on the team.				 																																	However, the Sunday Telegraph says after a meeting later on Friday it was agreed Coe, 46, would play a key role as her right-hand man. 				 																																	Barcelona: World champions Germany retained the mens European Nations Cup after a nail-biting 5-4 penalty-shoot victory over hosts Spain on Saturday. The victory also secured them a place at next years Olympics.				 																																	Earlier on Saturday, The Netherlands won the womens tournament for the fifth time in six attempts with a comprehensive 5-0 defeat of Spain in the final.				 																																	The victory ensured that the Dutch gained an automatic place for the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens and will not have to go through next years qualifying tournament in New Zealand.				 																																	London: Paula Radcliffe broke the world five-kilometre road record with a storming performance in a race in Londons Hyde Park on Sunday.				 																																	Radcliffe, the fastest woman marathon runner of all time, outpaced a world-class field to win in 14:51, taking 3 seconds off the previous best time set by American Deena Drossin in California last year. 				 																																	The Briton led virtually all the way to beat Ethiopias Derartu Tulu and Irelands Sonia OSullivan. 				 																																	Milan: The president of Serie B club Verona has resigned, blaming the row that has dogged Italian football over the past month for his decision.				 																																	Giambattista Pastorello said in a statement on the clubs website that the expansion of Serie B to 24 clubs, a move that followed legal and political wrangles, meant the credibility of (Italian) football has been totally annulled.				 																																	Three relegated clubs were handed reprieves by soccer authorities and Fiorentina were promoted from Serie C1. 				 																																	Essen (Germany): Schalke 04s Polish international Tomasz Hajto has been summoned to a court in Essen, facing charges of receiving stolen goods.				 																																	Midfielder Hajto, 30, is accused of being a customer of a cigarette smuggling organisation in the Ruhr area, north Germany.

 Lillee: NCA trainees have flawed run-ups
Chennai: Former Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee has pointed to technical flaws in the run-up of budding pacemen in the National and Zonal Cricket Academies of the BCCI. Lillee said the MRF Pace Foundation worked with 105 boys in the age group of under-15, 17 and 19 from the National Cricket Academys different zones and a commonality of technical flaws unfolded in these bowlers, mostly pertaining from the run-up and delivery process. Excessive rocking of the shoulders, arms across the chest in the running stride, incorrect angle of approach to the wicket were the run-up flaws, which affected the delivery process. These culminate into jumping in or out at the crease, both arms crossing the straight line in the load-ups and over balancing in the delivery stride, which result in a pushing of the ball, rather than bowling it, Lillee pointed out. The Aussie great, however, sounded satisfied with the significant improvement shown by the boys, who were giving their best to correct themselves.  (PTI)  Copyright

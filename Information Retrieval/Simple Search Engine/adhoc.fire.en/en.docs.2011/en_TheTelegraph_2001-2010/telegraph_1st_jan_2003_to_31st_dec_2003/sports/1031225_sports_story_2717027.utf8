The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vital to bat out first two hours, says Fleming
 Its still uncertain if Shoaib will make it Wellington: Pakistans formidable bowling attack will be bolstered by the return of Shoaib Akhtar for the second Test against New Zealand here on Friday, with New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming saying the outcome could be decided in his teams first two hours at the crease. The Black Caps received a huge wake-up call in the first Test in Hamilton when they amassed 563 in their first innings and then collapsed to 52 for seven and then 96 for eight in the second before bad light and rain ensured a draw. Mohammed Sami who finished with five for 44 of 16 overs was almost unplayable. Shoaib missed the first Test through injury, but if he passes a fitness Test before Friday, it will add to the pressure on New Zealand. No doubt about it, the first two hours we bat against them in this next Test is going to be very important, Fleming said. There were mixed messages from the Pakistan camp about Shoaib. Inzamam-ul Haq pronounced the Rawalpindi Express was ready for return , but coach Javed Miandad wasnt so bullish.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Liverpool take League Cup
Cardiff: Liverpool won the League Cup on Sunday after goals from Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen earned them a 2-0 victory over arch-rivals Manchester United in the final at the Millennium Stadium. Gerrards 30-metre drive in the 39th minute, which took a deflection off David Beckham, looked to have settled a clash which lived up to its billing in a pulsating second half after a scrappy opening 45 minutes. But Owen raced away on the break to fire a second past Fabien Barthez in the 86th minute and put the result beyond doubt. Liverpool, who had already won a record six League Cups, were ultimately rewarded for the solid defending and breakaway football which had also brought them the League and Uefa Cup trophies in that 2001 season. United went close to an equaliser just before the break when a shot from Juan Sebastian Veron was punched clear by Jerzy Dudek and a follow-up shot from Paul Scholes was cleared off the line by Stephane Henchoz.  Arsenal win 2-0 Champions Arsenal went eight points clear at the top of the Premier League after a comfortable 2-0 win over Charlton Athletic at Highbury. First half goals from striker Francis Jeffers and Robert Pires were enough to seal all three points in a match that the reigning champions dominated.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

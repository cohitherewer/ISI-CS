 IFA seeks AIFF help
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 12: IFA secretary Subrata Dutta has asked AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco to come to here before the Federation Cup to meet the clubs and sort out the dope testing issue. Several clubs have said they are not ready for this and needed time. The federation wants tests to be done in this championship. Look, a player cant say that he didnt know of the banned substances, said Dutta. Not knowing the rules is never an excuse. They will have to adhere to rules. The secretary admitted that no detailed list of banned drugs was available, not even with the IFA. We are taking this up quickly, and under IFAs medical chief Dr S.R. Das Gupta, we are preparing the list which will be distributed soon to all players in all divisions, he said.  Copyright

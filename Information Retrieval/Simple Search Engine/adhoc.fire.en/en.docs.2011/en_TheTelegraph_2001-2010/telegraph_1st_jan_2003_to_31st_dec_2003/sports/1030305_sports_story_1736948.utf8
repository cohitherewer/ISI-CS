				 																																	Dhaka: Bangladesh will sack the coach of its cricket team after its dismal performance at the World Cup, reports said on Tuesday.				 																																	Mohsin Kamal, who is Pakistani, will be asked to quit before his one-year contract expires on April 30, Dhakas Ittefaq daily reported.				 																																	We dont need anyone, who cant perform, Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Ali Asghar Loby was quoted as saying by another daily, Prothom Alo. It does not matter when the contract ends.				 																																	Kamal, a former Pakistani Test player, replaced Australian Trevor Chappell last year.				 																																	Bangladesh, the newest Test-playing nation, began the World Cup with a shock 60-run defeat to Canada and ended with a 32-run loss to Kenya. Bangladesh would most likely have lost all six Group B matches but for a rain-forced sharing of points with the West Indies.				 																																	The loss to Kenya was Bangladeshs 29th consecutive defeat in one-day Internationals. Bangladesh have also lost 15 of the 16 Tests it has played.				 																																	Johannesburg: Australia will go through to the World Cup Super Sixes in prime position to plot their own route right to the March 23 final. The world champions go through to the second phase with a maximum of 12 points. One more win when they face Sri Lanka in Centurion Friday in the opening match of the second phase before taking on Kenya and New Zealand and they will be heading for the final four.				 																																	Coach John Buchanan, however, has already made it clear that the world champions are determined to retain their momentum. That will not only keep up team morale but also allow the Australians to sidestep the second semi-final, a day-nighter in Durban where the toss could favour one side significantly.				 																																	While Pakistan and England joined South Africa and West Indies in the airport departure lounge on Tuesday, all of them wringing rainwater from their cricket trousers, unheralded Kenya and Zimbabwe were preparing for the next round.				 																																	Kimberley: West Indies captain Carl Hooper said cricket chiefs would have to look at changing World Cup rules on match forfeits and wash-outs after his team were knocked out of the tournament on Monday.				 																																	No disrespect to the Kenyans but theyve more or less qualified for the second round because of New Zealand not going to Kenya, Hooper said on Monday.				 																																	Its not the ideal situation, but I suppose the ICC (International Cricket Council) will still have to look into it.				 																																	Johannesburg: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming was delighted his team reached the World Cup Super Sixes on Monday, but said he could not help feeling sorry for South Africa.				 																																	The Black Caps sneaked through when South Africas must-win match against Sri Lanka ended in a tie under the Duckworth/Lewis method after rain forced the players off.				 																																	Fleming and his teammates watched the game on television. It was incredibly hard. I guess you dont like to see a situation like that for another team, Fleming said. 				 																																	Benoni: Big-hitting Canadian John Davison is dreaming of making a career in the English County Championship. A lot of good friendships were made and a lot of good contacts made here, said Davison whos been playing cricket in South Australia.				 																																	n Zimbabwe vs India, repeat from 9.30 am on SET Max n West Indies vs Kenya, highlights from 5.30 pm on SET Max n India vs Pakistan, repeat from 7.00 pm on SET Max

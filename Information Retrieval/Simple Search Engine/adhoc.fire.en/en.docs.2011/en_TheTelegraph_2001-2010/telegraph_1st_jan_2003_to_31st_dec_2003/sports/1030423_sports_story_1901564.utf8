The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Just what Sir Alex and doc ordered 
 Raul Madrid: Real Madrid were granting Alex Fergusons wishes, as well as following doctors orders, by sending Raul for emergency surgery that will keep him out of Wednesdays Champions League game against Manchester United. The United manager hailed Raul as the worlds best player after his two goals led Real to a 3-1 victory in the quarter final first leg in Madrid two weeks ago. Raul also scored twice in Reals 3-2 win over the English side in the Champions League in 2000 and Ferguson said he hoped the player would be stopped at the border. I hope he doesnt like travelling, Ferguson said. Failing that we will stop him entering the country. In the end, a case of acute appendicitis meant the English side did not have to rely on a compliant customs official to rule out Raul. Real Madrid were just happy to oblige, according to their director Jorge Valdano. Ferguson didnt want Raul coming to England but we went a bit further and stopped him leaving Spain, Valdano joked. His comments have turned out to be a bit of a jinx, its true. Seriously, though, all we can do is lament the timing of the injury and put all our faith in the squad.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

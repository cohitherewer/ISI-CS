 Fifa circular may force Alvito out
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: After Douglas da Silvas injury, there may be more bad news awaiting East Bengal. According to a Fifa circular, there is a question mark over Alvito DCunhas availability for the Super League play-off final on November 2. The Fifa has said in its circular sent to the IFA that a player receiving a red card is automatically disqualified from the next game. If this cannot be exercised in the same meet, the ban will be carried forward to the next meet. Alvito received red card in the IFA Shield final, and East Bengals next game will be the play-off final against Mohun Bagan. The IFA has sought a clarification on the issue from the AIFF. Meanwhile East Bengals Dipak Mondal will undergo surgery in Mumbai on Monday under Dr. Ananth Joshi.

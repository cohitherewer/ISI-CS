The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lehmann, Bevan may push Symonds down
 Symonds: Wants to keep up good work Johannesburg: Andrew Symonds reward for his match-winning World Cup innings against Pakistan may be a demotion in the batting order. The Aussie all-rounder emerged at number six to score a spectacular 143 not out at the Wanderers Tuesday. But with Darren Lehmann to return after serving the last match of a five-game ban, and Michael Bevan expected to be fit after a groin injury, Symonds may find himself squeezed down to number seven for the next match, against India on Saturday. I dont know what we will do and it is a tough selection problem that I havent really thought about too much yet, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said. I guess it will be Lehmann at five, Bevan at six and Simmo will have to slide down the pole to seven for the next match. The likely return of Lehmann and Bevan means Jimmy Maher will step aside and all-rounder Ian Harvey is also likely to miss out despite an impressive return to the team.  Now with Shane out we will have to address which way we go in terms of selection for the rest of the tournament, Ponting said. Symonds said the secret of his success was an uncomplicated approach. When I got out there with Ricky (Ponting) he gave me a hand with each ball, said Symonds. If I hit a four or played a good shot he came down and just said to me next ball and throughout my innings all I worried about was watching the next ball I had to face. When I keep my cricket simple it usually goes alright. It has been a while coming, and I am sorry for that, but now hopefully I can go on from here, he added. Australia travelled to Pretoria on Wednesday with a fielding practice session scheduled for late afternoon at Centurion. (Reuters)  Copyright

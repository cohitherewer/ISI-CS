The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, October 15, 2003  Adolfito has edge over Double Eagle 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 Dhariwal				 										Mysore: The two horses most likely to be involved at the finish of the 1,600m Royal Calcutta Turf Club Cup here on Wednesday are Double Eagle and Adolfito. Both are in the pink of condition, going by their repeated trial gallops. They have met twice, with the former finishing ahead in their first meeting. There is little to choose between them at weights and it could be anybodys race. 				 										However, the Jaggy Dhariwal-ward Adolfito, with Shafiq in the saddle, looks to hold a razor-thin edge.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2.15 pm: Good Hope 1. Purple Shadow 2.

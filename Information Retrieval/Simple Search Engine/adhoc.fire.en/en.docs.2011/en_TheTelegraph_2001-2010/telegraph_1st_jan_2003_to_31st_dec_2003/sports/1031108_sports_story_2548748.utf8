 Fleming denies criticising itinerary
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Guwahati: New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming Friday flatly denied that he has criticised the tri-series itinerary, asserting it was a creation of the media. Fleming was quoted Tuesday by a New Zealand website as saying that the itinerary was aimed at suiting India only as New Zealand and Australia were made to play all the day matches in tough conditions. Explaining his position to mediapersons here this evening, Fleming reiterated what he told the website  New Zealand and the Aussies were playing two sets of cricket in the tri-series, one for New Zealand and Australia, where it seams around and is tough to bat, and Indians play another one where it gets lower and slower then turns. I have never criticised the itinerary, but I still stand by what I told the media. It is a creation of the media that I had criticised the itinerary. I was just explaining my position, Fleming said. Spinner Daniel Vettori had words of praise for Anil Kumble, calling him great. Styris fined New Zealand allrounder Scott Styris was fined $1,478 for showing dissent after being given out in Thursdays four-wicket victory over India, adds PTI from Cuttack. According to sources, Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle stopped short of suspending him, apparently after taking into account his excellent disciplinary record.  Copyright

 Sachin can upset our plans: Steve
 Steve thinks Aussies will find it difficult to dislodge Sachin Kochi: Indias Test series against Australia is three months away, but Sachin Tendulkar has already started worrying the Aussies with captain Steve Waugh admitting his bowlers will find it difficult to dismiss the master batsman. India have very good individual players and Tendulkar is a great batsman known the world over. He is very hard to get out, Waugh, here as brand ambassador of AMP Sanmar Assurance, said on Monday. The Test skipper denied that his bowlers targeted individuals and said it was just that they worked on a plan for specific players. We have plans for every player and sometimes they work. But great players overcome that. They can change the game and improvise. Sachin can do that, said Waugh. Waugh, who does not figure in Australias ODI team, said the tri-series involving India, New Zealand and Australia later this year will be a close affair. Waugh, the worlds most successful Test captain, said victory did not come to him straightaway. It took me 17 matches to get my first hundred. It was a different era and it was the time when the selectors had a lot of faith in the players. We were given time to find our feet. Having scored centuries at a time when critics were trying to write him off, the 37-year-old said: I know what I am capable of. I have played to the best of my ability and am enjoying the challenge. About Shane Warne, Waugh said: He will have to keep himself in shape if he wants to come back. His fitness will be assessed before he is considered for selection for the tour of Sri Lanka. On a recent poll, which revealed football has become more popular than cricket in Australia, Waugh said: Soccer is very popular in our country, but cricket is part of our tradition. The great thing about soccer is it does not cost a lot to play. The cricketer also visited an orphanage and spent time with the children. He said he was delighted to be in the company of the young, energetic and loving children.  (PTI)  Copyright

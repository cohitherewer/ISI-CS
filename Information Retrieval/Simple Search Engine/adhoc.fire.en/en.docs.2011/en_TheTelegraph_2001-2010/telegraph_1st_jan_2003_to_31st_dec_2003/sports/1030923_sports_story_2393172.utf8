The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gairiks dream comes true
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Bengals Gairik Bardhan said on Monday the loss to Deepak Singh in the 100m breatstroke the previous day, had stimulated him to stand on top of the podium, at least once. Gairik fulfilled his dream, claiming gold his pet event  200m breaststroke, but Sundays disappointment was still haunting him. I could not gauge my distance from Deepak in the final thrust and that cost me the gold, Gairik said of his second-place finish in the 100m breatstroke. But my coach (Biswajit Dey Chowdhury) told me to forget that incident and not to get nervous today. The performance of Gairik and Akbar Ali Mir in the nationals, which concluded on Monday, earned them a call-up in the probables for Afro-Asian Games. Both, however, said wins here would give them confidence in the upcoming meet in Hyderabad. Akbar, on the other hand, admitted he had not had the best of start here, but peaked later. It was disappointing, so to say. But todays gold was most satisfying as well, he added. Meanwhile, Gairik is set to be employed with Eastern Railways later this year.  Copyright

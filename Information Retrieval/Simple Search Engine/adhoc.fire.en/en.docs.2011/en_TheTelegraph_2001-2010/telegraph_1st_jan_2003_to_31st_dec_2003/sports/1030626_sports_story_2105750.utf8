 Roddick guns Rusedski down
 - Venus, Davenport in Round 3 l Srichaphan survives five-setter, Kuerten out  Two-time womens champion Venus Williams rolled into the third round at Wimbledon Wednesday, beating Katarina Srebotnik 6-4, 6-1 in 61 minutes London: American Andy Roddick burned Britains Greg Rusedski 7-6, 7-6, 7-5 on Wednesday in an explosive Wimbledon second round showdown. Rusedski left the court fuming after an umpire over-rule at a vital point of the third set, having earlier hurled a foul-mouthed volley of abuse at the official. But he could have few complaints as 20-year-old Roddick outplayed him in the two first set tie-breaks in the shootout between the worlds two fastest servers. The fifth-seeded American kept his cool in the third set to seal victory with an ace and set up a third-round clash against Spains Tommy Robredo. In the womens section, fifth seed Lindsay Davenport and twice champion Venus Williams also sailed into the third round with comfortable victories. Davenport beat Italian Rita Grande 6-3, 6-1, while Venus  showing no signs of the abdominal injury that bedevilled her in Paris  dumped Slovenian Katarina Srebotnik 6-4, 6-1. Second seed Kim Clijsters stepped up her bid for the title with a ruthless 6-1, 6-3 win over Frances Virginie Razzano in the second round. A venerable-looking Todd Martin used his height, reach and grasscourt experience to knock out Gustavo Kuerten out 7-6, 6-4, 6-4. The match was interrupted briefly after the first-set tie-break because of rain and the Brazilian, who had not played a match on grass for nearly three years, never settled afterwards. Martin, now ranked 102 in the world, meets Rainer Schuettler in the third round. Roger Federer teamed old-fashioned wit and guile with 21st century brawn to slice deeper into the draw. The Swiss fourth seed mowed down good friend Stefan Koubek 6-4, 6-1, 6-1 on an overcast Centre Court. Casting off his underachievers reputation with each victory  Federer has lost in the first round here three of his four previous visits  the Swiss put on a virtuoso performance for tennis purists. It was great to be out there, especially with a good friend, he said. Next up for the stylish Swiss is 45th-ranked Mardy Fish. Fish scaled new heights earlier on an outside court, ousting fellow American Jan-Michael Gambill 6-4, 6-4, 6-1. The 21-year-old had never won a match at the All England Club before this year and his victory on Court 11 matches the best Grand Slam performance of his career. Ninth seed Schuettler also advanced smoothly. The German, a surprise finalist at the Australian Open in January, beat Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-2, 6-3, 6-3. Thai 12th seed Paradorn Srichaphan saved two match points as he stormed back from two sets down to beat Frenchman Olivier Mutis 4-6, 1-6, 7-6, 7-5, 7-5 in the second round. Paes-Rikl in 2nd round Leander Paes and David Rikl moved into the second round of the mens doubles with a fluent win over Spanish duo Juan Ignacio Carrasco and Juan Carlos Ferrero. The fifth-seeded pair won 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 and will take on Nicolas Kiefer-David Prinosil.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

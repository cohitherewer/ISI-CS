The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McMillan recalled, Shane Bond out
 Cairns is for ODIs only Wellington: Middle-order batsman Craig McMillan has been recalled to the New Zealand Test and one-day teams to tour India and Pakistan beginning in September, New Zealand Cricket announced on Tuesday. Strike bowler Shane Bond, who is recovering from a back injury, will miss the tour. Allrounder Chris Cairns, whose wife is expecting their second child, will not play in the Test matches but is in the ODI team. Also returning to the team after an injury-enforced absence is Nathan Astle. Michael Mason will take Bonds place in the Test team. McMillan, who had a poor run of form late last year and during the World Cup, had been dropped for the tour of Sri Lanka in April. He was recalled because of his experience and because the selectors were confident he would recapture his best form, selection manager Richard Hadlee said. The Test squad leaves for Brisbane for an eight-day camp on September 10, but will return home before leaving for India on September 21.  THE SQUADS Tests: Stephen Fleming (captain), Nathan Astle, Ian Butler, Robbie Hart, Richard Jones, Michael Mason, Craig McMillan, Jacob Oram, Mark Richardson, Scott Styris, Daryl Tuffey, Daniel Vettori, Lou Vincent, Paul Wiseman.ODIs: Stephen Fleming (captain), Nathan Astle, Ian Butler, Chris Cairns, Chris Harris, Paul Hitchcock, Brendon McCullum, Craig McMillan, Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Scott Styris, Daryl Tuffey, Daniel Vettori, Lou Vincent.

				 																																																	 Akuneto Chukwuma, Mohun Bagans Nigerian recruit has complained to the Fifa players status committee that the club has not cleared his dues. In his complaint, Akuneto says though he had a three-month contract with a monthly payment of Rs. 70,000, Mohun Bagan has cleared only Rs 1 lakh. This, with less than a month left before his contract gets over on October 18.				 																																																	A copy of the letter has also been sent to the AIFF and the IFA. However, a senior Bagan official claimed that dues were cleared.				 																																																	Meanwhile, another Nigerian Peter Nwoji, playing for Mohammedan Sporting, had complained to the AIFF for similar reasons. The AIFF has instructed the IFA to seek an explanation from the club. But Mohammedan Sporting secretary Sultan Ahmed said they have a two-month contract with him and it has been sorted out.

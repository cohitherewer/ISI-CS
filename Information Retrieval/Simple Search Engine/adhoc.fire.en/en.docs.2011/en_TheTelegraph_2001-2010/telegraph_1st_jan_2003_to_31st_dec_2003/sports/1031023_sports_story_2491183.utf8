 Bangladesh bundled out for 203
 - England 111 for no loss at stumps after Harmison (5/35), Hoggard (3/55) trigger hosts collapse  England pacer Stephen Harmison (centre) celebrates one of his victims in Dhaka on Wednesday. (AP) Dhaka: Paceman Stephen Harmisons first five-wicket haul helped England to a position of strength against Bangladesh in the first Test here on Wednesday. Harmison, who turns 25 on Thursday, finished with figures of five for 35 as Bangladesh were bowled out for 203 at the stroke of tea. In reply, England were a solid 111 without loss on a day when floodlights were needed in overcast conditions. Left-hander Marcus Trescothick further tormented the home side by playing a strokeful 77 laced with 12 boundaries and a six, while captain Michael Vaughan was on 30 at close. After his new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard troubled Bangladesh early in the second session, Harmison came back to help remove the tail with the second new ball. The Durham seamer had earlier dismissed overnight batsman Rajin Saleh and also accounted for Javed Omar and Habibul Bashar on the rain-hit first day. England coach Duncan Fletcher was happy at his teams performance, particularly Harmison. It was a fine effort by Harmison and I hope this will go a long way in helping him develop as a good Test bowler, said Fletcher. He adjusted his length according to the need of the pitch. For Bangladesh, Khaled Mashud led a rearguard action with his maiden half-century in 22 Tests, improving on his previous best of 44 against Australia in Darwin earlier this year. Mashud (51) put on 60 runs for the sixth wicket with Mushfiqur Rahman (34) and 34 with left-hander Mohammed Rafique (32) before falling leg-before to debutant Rikki Clarke.  (AFP)  Copyright

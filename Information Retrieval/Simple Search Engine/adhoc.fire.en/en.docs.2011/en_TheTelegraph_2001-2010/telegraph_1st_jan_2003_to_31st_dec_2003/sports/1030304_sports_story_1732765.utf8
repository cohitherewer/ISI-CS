The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I didnt have to hurry after the start my idol gave
- Yuvraj feels India have a good chance of becoming only Asian side to lift Cup twice  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Yuvraj: Dream of facing Wasim Akram realised Pretoria: Yuvraj Singh didnt miss out on Chandigarhs frenzied celebrations to mark Indias 1996 World Cup quarter final win (in Bangalore) over Pakistan. Seven years on, having himself played a big role in yet another victory, last Saturday, he is stumped at the adulation and the feedback from home.I believe people in India have gone mad... As for myself, the calls havent stopped. Funnily, I dont even know most of the callers, Yuvraj remarked Monday afternoon, while interacting with a select group of Mediamen.Yuvraj, of course, is grateful to Sachin Tendulkar for providing him the platform to settle down before keeping the scorers busy in Centurion. India, it may be recalled, won by six wickets.Unbeaten on an excellent 50, Yuvraj emphasised that Sachins blistering 98 made it easy when he took guard at 177 for four. I didnt have to hurry as my idol had given such an extraordinary start... I could get the eye in before going for my shots.According to Yuvraj, Sachins innings also allowed him to back himself even more. I stuck to the basics and backed myself... I did, after all, learn from Sachin whose body-language, in the dressing room itself, had supreme confidence written all over...But, surely, there must have been pressure on two counts  the World Cup plus a game versus Pakistan?Well, we cant do anything about pressure... Its best to back yourself and, thankfully, Rahul Dravid was at the other end... Weve had some very fine partnerships and he has always been hugely supportive. Hes a pro, Yuvraj replied.Yuvraj, by the way, realised one dream when he faced his favourite bowler  Wasim Akram. I wasnt overawed... Played straight and backed myself...His top innings, though, remains the 84 against Australia (ICC KnockOut, Nairobi, 2000). While that was his second ODI, it was his first essay with the bat. Asked whether the on-field exchanges were decidedly more as it was an India-Pakistan match, Yuvraj answered in the affirmative. Both teams were so charged-up that things had to be said... Obviously, I wouldnt like to go into specifics...Later, speaking to The Telegraph, Yuvraj accepted that Team India had a good chance of creating history  becoming the first Asian side to claim the World Cup twice. Lets keep our fingers crossed, he said, smiling.We  Copyright

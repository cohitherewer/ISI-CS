The Telegraph - Calcutta
 October bout for Holyfield
 Holyfield will take on Toney New York: Unable to get another shot at winning an unprecedented fifth heavyweight title, Evander Holyfield will face James Toney, who knows about waiting for a title bout. Holyfield, who was seeking a bout with World Boxing Association heavyweight champion Roy Jones, will instead face the current International Boxing Federation cruiserweight champion on October 4. The fighters have not decided on a location yet, as the deal was made quickly and came as a surprise to many at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon. Holyfield (38-5-2, with 25 wins inside the distance) comes off a unanimous decision loss to Chris Byrd for the vacant IBF heavyweight title in December and was hoping to get a shot at Jones title. Its my goal to be heavyweight champion of the world and I will be the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, Holyfield said. I may not get it when I want to, but I will get it. Ive been boxing for 13 years, Ive had my ups and downs. Toney (66-4-2, 42 wins inside the distance), who went more than seven years without a major title bout before recording a hard-fought unanimous decision over previously undefeated Vassiliy Jirov on April 26, will be fighting as a heavyweight for the first time. The 40-year-old Holyfield has not held a title since losing a unanimous decision to John Ruiz for the WBA strap in March 2001. The fighters met for a third time in December 2001 and Ruiz maintained the belt after they fought to a draw. Jones made history on March 1, when he became the first former middleweight in more than a century to capture the heavyweight championship with a unanimous decision over Ruiz.  (AFP)  Copyright

 South Africas Bangla trip on
 BOUCHER: Loses deputys job Cape Town: South Africa will tour Bangladesh later this month after receiving assurances over the teams security in the country, a South African cricket official said on Tuesday. The US-led war in Iraq prompted speculation that the tour might be cancelled, but United Cricket Board of South Africa chief executive Gerald Majola said on Tuesday he was happy the South Africans would not be at risk in Bangladesh. The South African ministry of foreign affairs has written to us that, in light of the on-going war in Iraq, the tour to Bangladesh may be favourably considered if the relevant authorities there provide the team with the necessary and adequate security control measures, Majola said in a statement. We have received an assurance from the Bangladesh Cricket Board and their government that all necessary security steps have been taken and that the team will face no security problems. Barring any unforeseen circumstances or changes to this situation, the tour is on. South Africa are due to play a triangular one-day tournament which also includes World Cup runners-up India, and two Tests against Bangladesh. The one-day series begins on April 11. The South Africans pulled out of this weeks Sharjah tournament a week ago following the outbreak of war in the Gulf, citing fears for player safety. No vice-captain Meanwhile, Mark Boucher has been dropped as vice-captain after the UCBSA decided on Monday against re-appointing anyone to the post, adds a report from Johannesburg. The decision followed the sacking of Shaun Pollock as captain after South Africa failed to reach the second round of the World Cup. Graeme Smith, 22, was appointed captain. A UCB media release said the selection panel had decided against naming a vice-captain for the tour to Bangladesh, but has elected rather to work though a process to identify the right candidate during the tour. The vice-captain would be decided on a match-by-match basis, the UCB said. (Reuters)  Copyright

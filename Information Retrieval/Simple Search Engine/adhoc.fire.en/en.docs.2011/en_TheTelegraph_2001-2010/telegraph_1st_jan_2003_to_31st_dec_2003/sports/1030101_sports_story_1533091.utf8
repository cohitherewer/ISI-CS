		 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Bengal crash to 9-wkt loss
																								Mumbai: The year ended on a sour note for Bengal as they crashed to a nine-wicket loss against Mumbai in a Ranji Trophy elite group match at the Wankhede Stadium Tuesday. Leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule returned with a six-wicket haul to bundle out the visitors for a paltry 179 in the second innings. 																								Mumbai knocked off the required 48 runs for win with the loss of Amit Velaskar. The loss left Bengal on two points from five games and a fight to save the relegation is on the cards. Mumbai have got eight and they are almost assured of a place in the semis. (PTI)

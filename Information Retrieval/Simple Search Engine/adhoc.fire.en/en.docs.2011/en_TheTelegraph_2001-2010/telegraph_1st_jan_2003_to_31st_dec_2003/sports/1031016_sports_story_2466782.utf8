The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Engineer theory
Mumbai: The debate over who should keep wickets for India in one-dayers continues and former India stumper Farokh Engineer has entered the ring, saying Rahul Dravid should be the man. Engineer said Dravid did a good job with the big gloves in the World Cup and should continue doing so till India find a wicketkeeper who can also contribute with the bat. There is no doubt that Parthiv Patel, the No. 1 wicketkeeper in Tests, is a fine prospect and looks very competent behind the stumps. But to accommodate an additional batsman or a bowler in one-dayers, Dravid has to continue keeping wickets for the sake of the team, he said. Parthiv will be very successful infuture and has a very flexible body with fine movement, though he is still to adjust to one-day cricket. In ODIs, a wicketkeeper has to bat like a top-order batsman, stroking the ball hard and not slice the ball like Parthiv does, Engineer said. (PTI)  Copyright

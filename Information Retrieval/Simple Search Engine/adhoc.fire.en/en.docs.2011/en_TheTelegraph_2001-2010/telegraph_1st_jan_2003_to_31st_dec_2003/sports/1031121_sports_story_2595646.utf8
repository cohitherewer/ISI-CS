The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Uthappa ton in drawn tie
Rajkot: India U-19 opener Robin Uthappa and Sri Lanka A skipper Naveed Nawaz blazed sparkling centuries even as the three-day match ended in draw on the third and final day here on Thursday. Resuming at their overnight score of 180 for three, Lankans declared their second innings at 392 for five just before tea after Nawaz cracked a brilliant 116 with 13 hits to the fence. He put on 107 runs for the fourth wicket with Anushka Pollonwita, who also came up with a patient 68 with nine boundaries. In reply, the Indians made 166 in just 26 overs for the loss of two wickets. Chasing a massive target of 408 with hardly two hours of play left, Uthappa and Sachin Dholpure mounted a fiery assault on Lankan bowlers, scoring at nearly 6.5 runs per over on a track which had little to offer to the bowlers. Uthappa smashed 18 boundaries and a six for his 102, which came off just 67 balls. He got some good support at the other end from a relatively calm Dholpure, who also got his half century with six boundaries to put on a 141-run opening stand. Lankan spinner Mudalige finally got the better of Uthappa, when the latter came out and tried to hit him outside the ground but missed the delivery to be stumped by keeper Jayawardene.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chelsea stay at the top
London, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Chelsea stayed top of the Premier League on Saturday despite being held 1-1 at Leeds United after Arsenal conceded a late equaliser to also draw 1-1 at Leicester City. A 90th-minute equaliser for Leicester by Craig Hignett dramatically denied Arsenal, who had defender Ashley Cole sent off, victory at the Walkers Stadium. Chelsea stay a point clear of Arsene Wengers unbeaten team with 36 points after Damien Duffs second-half equaliser gave them a 1-1 draw at Elland Road. Champions Manchester United are only a point behind Arsenal after thrashing Aston Villa 4-0 at Old Trafford. Newcastle United and Liverpool drew 1-1 at St James Park and Wolves went bottom after losing 5-2 at Spurs.  Copyright

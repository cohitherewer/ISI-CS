The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kaif likely to bat at No. 4
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Kaif: Wasted down the order Pretoria: Dinesh Mongia, who hasnt made a positive impression when batting at No.3/4 in the World Cup, could be sent down the order in Indias last Pool A match, versus Pakistan, Saturday. Mongia, it may be recalled, struggled for his 32 (off 66 balls) against England and, as sources of The Telegraph put it, theres a reasonable chance that Mohammed Kaif will be promoted. In that case, Kaif will bat at No.4, with Mongia going down three slots. A decision, of course, should be taken by Friday evening. Its a fact that Kaif and Yuvraj Singh are being wasted low in the order. Incidentally, there were whispers that senior pro Anil Kumble could replace Harbhajan Singh but, till late Thursday, there was nothing to suggest that change would actually come about. Meanwhile, with the Indians on the verge of qualifying for the Super Six, quite a few players are set to seek Board president Jagmohan Dalmiyas permission to call either their spouse and/or family over. The first to come across may well be the First Lady of Indian cricket, Dona Ganguly, and 15-month-old Sana. The Board disallowed the presence of family members in the league stage.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atapattu, Sangakkara hit fifties 
Gros Islet (St Lucia): Sri Lanka recovered from the early loss of Sanath Jayasuriyas wicket to reach a healthy 125 for one midway through the second session of the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies here Friday. Maravan Atapattu was on a typically patient 59 and Kumar Sangakkara 54. Earlier, pace bowler Corey Collymore celebrated his return to Tests by dismissing Jayasuriya (8) with the score on 19. The tourists, opting to bat first after Hashan Tillekeratne had called correctly, were 77 for one at lunch after 25 overs. Colleymore started nervously but in the 10th over tempted Jayasuriya into a flashing cut to the throat of Omari Banks at gully. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Bangladesh in for a lesson: Gilchrist
 Gilchrist says there will be many positives for both teams Sydney: Adam Gilchrist says Australia are on a ruthless mission for next months apparent Test mismatch against Bangladesh  to teach them a lesson they will never forget. Bangladesh are here for their first series against the worlds top team and they will play two Tests and three one-day matches. People will look at the series and say its going to be a write-off, that we are going to go out there and not only win but smash them, Gilchrist said Wednesday. Hopefully, if we play well, we will achieve that because that will mean we are still playing to our level. Bangladesh have struggled in international cricket but they are here and we are playing them. There is no doubt they will benefit from the experience, whether it is an absolute thrashing or if they really surprise everyone and do well. Win, lose or draw, it will be a step forward for them to play against what is perceived to be the best team in the world. To those who say it will be a waste of time, Gilchrist said: There are a lot of positives to the series that people might be overlooking. It is the first time for Australia playing Bangladesh, so we will be making history in that regard. And there will be the excitement factor of the locals up there getting to see Test match cricket. Gilchrist revealed he had also been called by Lloyd Dorfman, the chairman of Travelex, inviting him onto the board of the worlds largest foreign exchange company. He accepted the role, becoming a non-executive director. The appointment is believed to be the first of its kind for an active Australian sportsman. Gilchrists good sportsmanship at the World Cup, when he walked from the crease despite the umpire giving him not out, convinced Dorfman  who was sitting in the grandstand at Port Elizabeth  to invite him to play a larger role in Travelex.

				 																																	Karachi: The home of English cricket has granted lifetime membership to Pakistan coach and former captain Javed Miandad.				 																																	Miandad said on Friday he has received a letter of confirmation from Marylebone Cricket Club secretary Roger Knight earlier this week. Its a great honour for me as most of the legends of cricket have been given a MCC membership, Miandad said. 				 																																	Other Pakistan players to have received the honour have been Hanif Mohammad, Fazal Mahmood, Wasim Raja, Iqbal Qasim, Nasim-ul-Ghani and Khan Mohammad.				 																																	New Delhi: Continuing their good form, India blanked Malaysia 3-0 to record their third straight victory in the junior challenge open mens hockey tournament in Gniezno, Poland.				 																																	The Indians dominated the match from the word go and were leading 2-0 at half time, according to a press release by the Indian Hockey Federation here.				 																																	They earned five penalty corners and converted two with Sandeep Singh and Vivek Gupta finding the net. Tushar Khandekar scored the third goal for India in the second half. The Indians played a defensive game in the second half as two of their players  Nitin Kumar and Birendra Lakra  were shown yellow cards.				 																																	Madrid: Basque side Athletic Bilbao are to break with tradition and allow sponsorship of their shirts in an attempt to raise new funds, club president Ignacio Ugartetxe said on Thursday.				 																																	Bilbao and Barcelona are the only two first division sides in Spain who do not permit shirt advertising, but both clubs have announced they now will be seeking a sponsor.				 																																	We wanted to find a way of generating income without having to hit the fans too much, Ugartetxe told a media conference. We are having to move with the times.				 																																	Munich: Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer has backed suggestions by Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder, president of the German Football Federation (DFB), to restrict the influx of foreigners into the Bundesliga. 				 																																	Since the 1994-95 season, the final year before the Bosman ruling, the number of foreigners plying their trade in the Bundesliga has almost trebled, jumping from 21.1 per cent to 60 per cent at the start of the 2003-04 campaign.				 																																	Beckenbauer believes Germany should follow the example of Italy where Serie A and Serie B clubs can only recruit one non-European player per season.				 																																	Manchester: Manchester City midfielder Alf Inge Haaland has announced his retirement after failing to recover from a knee injury he says resulted from a tackle by Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane.				 																																	The 30-year-old damaged his left knee during a derby clash two seasons ago and has undergone three operations in an attempt to return to football.				 																																	Manchester United have always denied the injury was related to the tackle, pointing out Keane made contact with Haalands right leg and that the Norwegian had played since the tackle.				 																																	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has released Abdul Razzaq to play three matches for Middlesex. The Pakistan board has permitted Razzaq to fly to England in the middle of the Test series against Bangladesh. He had requested that since he is not in the  Test team he should be allowed to play three matches for  Middlesex, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said.

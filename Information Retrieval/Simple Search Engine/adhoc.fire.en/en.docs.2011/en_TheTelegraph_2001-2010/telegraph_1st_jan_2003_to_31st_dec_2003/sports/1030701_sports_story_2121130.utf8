		 Tuesday, July 01, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Tehran: An Iranian footballer killed a player from the opposing side  who had just scored a goal  by punching him in the head, it was reported here on Monday.				 																																	The Yas-e No daily said an amateur match in Ahwaz in the south-west last Friday turned ugly when a defender punched an opposing forward who had just scored.				 																																	The victim was carried from the pitch and when his death was announced over loudspeakers the attacker was detained by the opposing team and handed over to the police. 				 																																	Melbourne: Don Bradmans last baggy green cap has sold for A$425,000 ($285,235), smashing the world record for a cricket cap.				 																																	The cap, which was originally due to be offered at auction next month, went to an anonymous Australian buyer who plans to put it on public display. Bradman wore the cap on his final tour of England in 1948. He was wearing it when he scored his final Test century and also his last-innings duck. The price eclipsed the previous world record for a cricket cap of $58,690 that was paid last week for Bradmans 1947-48 cap. Bradman, who averaged 99.94 in his 52-Test career, died in 2001 aged 92.				 																																	London: Former England midfielder Paul Gascoigne will not return to Chinese B-League team Gansu Tianma until he is paid back-dated wages, his agent said on Monday.				 																																	Paul is owed money by Gansu and will not be going back until the matter is resolved, Wes Saunders said.				 																																	Gascoigne, who entered an Arizona clinic in April after suffering from depression, signed a one-year renewable contract to become player-coach at Gansu in January.				 																																	The 36-year-old was due back at the club on June 10 but has not returned to China, prompting Gansu on Monday to ask the Chinese Football Association to investigate what they consider a breach of contract.				 																																	Sydney: Shane Warne will make a comeback of sorts next month when he joins Channel Nines commentary team for Australias cricket series against Bangladesh, the network said on Monday.				 																																	It will be the 33-year-old leg-spinners first commentary role since being suspended from cricket for a year in February for taking a banned diuretic. The first Test starts in Darwin on July 18.				 																																	Buenos Aires: River Plate clinched the Argentine championship with one game to spare on Sunday as they beat Olimpo 2-0 while second-placed Velez Sarsfield were beaten 0-1 at home by Estudiantes.				 																																	River struck with two goals in the last ten minutes after Olimpo had dominated the match. Victor Zapata opened the scoring four minutes after coming on as a substitute, and the second goal came from Diego Armando Barranda.				 																																	Vilnius (Lithuania): Raimondas Rumsas has failed a second doping test taken during the Giro DItalia cycle race, the Lithuanian Sports Federation said on Monday. Rumsas now faces a two-year ban. Rumsas tested positive for an unspecified drug during the Giro that ended June 1. He finished sixth.  Sport on Screen

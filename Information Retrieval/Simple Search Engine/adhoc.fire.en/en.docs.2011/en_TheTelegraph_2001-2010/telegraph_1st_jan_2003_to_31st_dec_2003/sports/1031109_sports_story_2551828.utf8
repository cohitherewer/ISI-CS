 - first test l Jacobs (61 not out) negates Price efforts  Ray Price appeals unsuccessfully for a leg-before decision in Harare on Saturday. (Reuters) Harare, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Zimbabwe spinner Ray Price claimed his first match haul of 10 wickets but could not stop West Indies escaping with a draw in the first Test on Saturday. Set 373 to win, West Indies survived a top-order crisis to cling on and end the final day on 207 for nine, with wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs saving his side with 61 not out after occupying the crease for three hours. He and No. 11 Fidel Edwards survived 11.5 overs. Zimbabwe, looking for their first win over West Indies, had the consolation of ending a run of 11 consecutive Test defeats. The second and final Test starts on Wednesday in Bulawayo. The home team dominated the encounter from the start after scoring 507 for nine in their first innings before bowling out their opponents for 335, with Price taking a Test-best six wickets for 73. Zimbabwe then rattled up 200 for seven before declaring again and pressing for victory with 83 overs remaining. Left-arm spinner Price was again the mainstay of the attack, with four for 89 and a match analysis of 10 for 162. He became the third Zimbabwean, after leg-spinners Paul Strang and Adam Huckle, to take 10 in a Test. Fast bowler Andy Blignaut took two for 49, while fast bowler Heath Streak did the early damage in claiming two for 28. West Indies had reached lunch looking comfortable on 18 without loss only to lose three wickets, including that of Brian Lara, for one run shortly after the break. Wavell Hinds pulled a delivery from Streak to Stuart Carlisle.Four balls later Chris Gayle drove recklessly at a wide delivery and was caught behind. A run and 11 balls after that Lara, having faced six balls for a single, offered no stroke to a ball from Price that pitched on the left-handers off-stump and seemed to track away from the wicket. Umpire Billy Bowden adjudged Lara to be out leg-before. At 38 for three, the West Indies were wobbling. But Daren Ganga and Ramnaresh Sarwan held up Zimbabwes progress for 11 overs until Ganga charged Price and was bowled for 16.  Copyright

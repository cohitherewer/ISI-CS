The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chelsea hold Arsenal
London: A late equaliser by Frank Lampard earned Chelsea a 2-2 draw with Arsenal in an action-packed FA Cup quarter final clash at Highbury on Saturday. Arsenal had appeared set to remain on course for a repeat league and Cup double as they led 2-1 with seven minutes remaining, before the England midfielder got the final touch for the equaliser after a goalmouth scramble. Defender John Terry had headed Chelsea into the lead after three minutes and Arsenals Thierry Henry then missed a penalty before fellow striker Francis Jeffers equalised in the 35th minute. Henry made amends when he put Arsenal 2-1 up with a brilliant goal in first-half injury time. Liverpool win 2-0 A rare goal by Senegalese striker El Hadji Diouf and yet another by fellow striker Michael Owen gave Liverpool a much-needed 2-0 home win over Bolton Wanderers in Saturdays sole Premier League match. The win takes Liverpool to 46 points and up one place to sixth in the standings. Bolton keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen was beaten in first-half injury time when Diouf arrived at the far post to head in a goal-bound Owen effort just before it crossed the line  leading to fruitless protests from the Bolton players that the Senegalese player was offside. Boltons Ivan Campo shot wide from the edge of the box early in the first half but as the visitors committed men to attack, they were caught by a typical Liverpool break on 67 minutes. It ended with Diouf crossing low for Owen to score his 20th of the season. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Boxers punch way to fistful of medals
 Qamar won the Arjuna  Award and Commonwealth gold  Mary Kom reigned  supreme as pinweight championNew Delhi: Mohammed Ali Qamar and M.C. Mary Kom hogged the limelight with their medal-winning feats as Indian pugilists benefited from international exposures to bring about some creditable achievements this year. The Indian boxers had to their credit a rich medal haul of 63 medals from eight major competitions during the year. The pugilists got the chance to perform before the home crowd in four events including the inaugural Afro-Asian Games in Hyderabad and the second Asian women boxing in Hisar. The Indian eves did reasonably well to upstage China to take the second position in the Asian womens meet which evoked a good public response in the small town of Hisar. The year was particularly eventful for light flyweight boxer Ali Qamar who returned with a gold medal from the Commonwealth boxing championship and also won the Arjuna award while Mary Kom reigned supreme as pinweight champion in the evolving women section. Indian boxers made it to the finals of seven weight categories out of the total 11 categories in the Afro-Asian Games with Akhil Kumar and Jitender winning the gold. The officials at the Amateur Indian Boxing Federation believe it was quite a creditable performance by the local boys when the opposition comprised African and Asian big-wigs. The year began on a bright note for the country as boxers garnered eight gold, nine silver and three bronze from the 20 weight categories in the YMCA international championship held here in February. However, the competitions organised in Poland, Turkey and Cuba during April and May did not yield anything more than a few bronze medals for the pugilists. The Indian boxers regained form to bring home two gold, three silver and two bronze medals with a bonus of best boxers award for Akhil Kumar from Eduardo Garcia boxing championship at Santa Clara, Cuba in early June. Indian boxers competed in 10 weight categories. However, Indian boxing received a blow when for the first time in the history of the sport when three boxers were banned for their doping misdemeanour during the Hyderabad National Games in 2002. D Bhagya Rajan, Srikanth Poosa and Sandeep Kumar, all of whom represented Andhra Pradesh were held guilty by the Indian Olympic Association for taking performance enhancing drugs during the meet.

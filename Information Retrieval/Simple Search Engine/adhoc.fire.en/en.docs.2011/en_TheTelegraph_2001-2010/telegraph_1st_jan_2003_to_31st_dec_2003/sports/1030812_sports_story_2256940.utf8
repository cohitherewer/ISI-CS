 Vettori itching to bowl in India
 Vettori confident despite a hand injury New Delhi: Despite being troubled by an injury to the bowling hand, Daniel Vettori is looking forward to New Zealands tour of India, the ultimate for a spin bowler. Vettori, whose preparations for the tour were severely affected as the injury forced him to return home last week from England after a brief stint with Nottinghamshire, said he would not be surprised to see turning tracks on the tour. (Indian captain Sourav) Ganguly has already on record saying hes determined to make amends, so Im sure well see pitches prepared for their spinners, New Zealands most successful spinner said. But thats good news for me and Im looking forward to it, he was quoted as saying in the New Zealand Herald website. Vettori was not required to bowl during Indias tour of New Zealand last summer when Stephen Flemings team thrashed the tourists in the two Test played on under-prepared pitches which offered too-much lateral movement. India also lost the ODI series (2-5) that followed the Test matches. Vettori, who had an ordinary World Cup and was overshadowed by off- spinner Paul Wiseman during the tour of Sri Lanka, has more reason than most to look forward to the next months tour. Im really excited about India because its the ultimate tour for a spin bowler, he said. Vettoris plan to gain some vital match practice with Nottinghamshire came unstuck as he produced some ordinary performances before suffering an injury. The bowler, who split the webbing between the spinning fingers of his left hand, failed to impress during the match he played against the touring India A side in England, taking only one wicket for 104 runs in 14 overs. To add to his discomfort, there were complications on his hand and he had to be admitted to Nottingham Hospital with an infected arm. Vettori said he was frustrated with the way things went during his four weeks with the County side. I didnt bowl too well in the first game but started to come right, and then I was just sidelined by the hand injury, which was extremely frustrating, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mahindra win 1-0
Mumbai: Mahindra United hung on to a first-half strike by S. Venkatesh to defeat Durand Cup champions Salgaocar SC in a National Football League match here on Sunday. It was dull and drab encounter at the Cooperage. However, the forward line of both teams got a plethora of chances only to be wasted by some poor finishing. With the forwards competing with each other in missing the target, the lanky mid-fielder Venkatesh rose to the occasion in the 24th minute heading a corner kick by Falguni Dutta. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I am staying, assures Kallis
Johannesburg: South African cricket received a welcome shot in the arm on Saturday following their early World Cup exit when Jacques Kallis committed himself to playing for his country for the foreseeable future. Kallis, one of the worlds few genuine allrounders, had a modest World Cup but scotched rumours that he was about to pursue his career abroad. Kallis has been linked with several English counties and, more recently, with Western Australia. The man at the centre of all the speculation, though, said: If there has been any talk, it certainly hasnt reached me. I would hope I have at least a couple of good years at international level left in me, hopefully more. It was a horrible, disappointing World Cup for all of us but theres only one way to get over it and thats by setting new targets and moving forward. I want to be a part of that, Kallis said. Allan Donald confirmed his retirement from international matches on Saturday, while Pat Symcox stood down as a South Africa selector. Head selector Omar Henry said Symcox had cited work commitments as the reason.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

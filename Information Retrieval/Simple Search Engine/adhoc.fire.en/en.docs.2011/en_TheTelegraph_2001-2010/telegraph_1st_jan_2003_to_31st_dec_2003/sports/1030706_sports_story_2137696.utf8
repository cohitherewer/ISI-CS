The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Steve a champion: Sourav
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav has learnt from Steve never to give up Calcutta, July 5: Just the other day, Steve Waugh had kind words for Sourav Ganguly. Today, the latter reciprocated by defending Australias Test captain in the most emphatic manner. Its unfortunate that people keep putting Steve down. In my opinion, he remains a champion and has been doing enough to keep his place in the XI, Sourav told The Telegraph. While Steve has been reminding the world that he will continue as long as the enjoyment is there, the Jeff Thomsons and the David Hookes have been asking him to quit. For the statistically inclined, nobody has played more Tests (160) than Steve. Then, with 10,265 runs and 30 centuries he is second only to Allan Border in the first category and third  behind Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar  in the Test centurions club. Interacting briefly, the Team India captain added: In fact, Ive been looking up to Steve more for his qualities as a player than captain. Given the talent-level of his team, after all, its not difficult to However, only somebody special can consistently bat the way he does. Thanks to Steve, Ive learnt never to give up. While Steve himself isnt sure of the legacy he will be leaving once he does retire, Sourav has no doubts what that will be. Of course, Bobby Simpson and Mark Taylor have had a role, but its really Steve who has made Australia into such awesome world-beaters Many years on, he will still be saluted for taking Australia to such exceptional heights. That surely will be his legacy, he opined. [Speaking exclusively during his two-day trip here, this week, Steve had praised Sourav thus: His captaincy has direction and he enjoys his teams respect Under Sourav, the boys havent been backing down and they seem to enjoy a fight Earlier, most Indian sides would fall apart under pressure  not this one.] Its for good reasons, then, that the Team India captain draws inspiration from Steve. Moreover, he acknowledged that the legends off-the-pitch conduct had enhanced his stature even more. Its amazing that Steve keeps making long-haul trips to stay in touch with Udayan Indeed, I would request all those in a position to help, to do so. In any case, their number is small, Sourav, who himself quietly supports quite a few NGOs, pointed out. Meanwhile, Steve has appealed to Indias corporate sector for help in expanding his charity work specific to the daughters of leprosy sufferers. Im confident there are people (from industry) waiting to put up their hands If you ask me, theres no point having millions in the bank if that money isnt going to be utilised for improving the lives of the less privileged, he emphasised in a message from Chennai, on the eve of his return to Australia. Not that Steve needed to, but he did add: My own involvement (with Udayan and more) is long term and I intend giving as much time as I possibly can. Once Im through with cricket, my work in Calcutta will be high on my list of priorities. Many will raise a toast to that.  Copyright

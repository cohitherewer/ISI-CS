		 Wednesday, January 29, 2003 				 Green carpet welcome awaits Indians 
																								Durban: A massive welcome banner, Zulu dancers and a sitar recital will form part of the rousing welcome that the Indian cricket team will receive when they arrive here for their World Cup campaign.																								The hotel where the players will be staying will roll out a green carpet resembling a cricket pitch, complete with white markings, stumps and bails at each end.																								Its a variation of the red carpet treatment, but much more appropriate, said Ravi Nadasen, the assistant general manager of The Holiday Inn-Elangeni hotel.																								Durban will be the base city for the Indian cricket team. The community of Chatsworth has been fighting for a long time to have this match. We are very pleased to host the Indian cricketers, chairman of the cricket transformation committee in Kwazulu-Natal, Saha Govender said. (PTI)

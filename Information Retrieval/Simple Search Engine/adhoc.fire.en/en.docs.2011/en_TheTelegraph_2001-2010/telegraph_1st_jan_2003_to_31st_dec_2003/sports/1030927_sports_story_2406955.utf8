		 Saturday, September 27, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Milan: Brazilian World Cup winner Rivaldo has been released from his contract with European champions AC Milan, the Serie A club said on Friday. Milan said in a brief statement on their website that the former Barcelona player had asked to be released from his contract which ran until July 2005.				 																																	The decision to mutually cancel the contract, with effect from today, was taken in absolute friendship and calmness, said AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani.				 																																	Rivaldo, 31, has not featured for Milan in Serie A or the Champions League this season and recently said he felt humiliated by being left out of the side. 				 																																	Sydney: The Australian Open has been rescheduled from November to December to avoid clashing with the Davis Cup tennis final while another tour event has been cancelled because of financial problems.				 																																	Australian golf officials released separate statements on Friday announcing this years Open championship had been switched from November 27-30 to December 18-21 while the Perth International had been cancelled.				 																																	The Perth International had been scheduled for November 13-16 but was abandoned because of financial reasons, the PGA Tour of Australasia announced.				 																																	London: Former England allrounder Dominic Cork is leaving Derbyshire by mutual consent to seek an alternative county contract next season.				 																																	The time is right for me for a new challenge, but I wish everyone at Derby all the very best for the future, Cork said on Thursday.				 																																	Cork, 32, signed a one-year extension in June but had requested that his contract be terminated immediately so he could get a fresh start with a new county. He was replaced as captain by Australian batsman Michael Di Venuto on Tuesday.				 																																	Milan: Claudio Taffarel, Brazils World Cup winning goalkeeper in 1994, has announced his retirement from the game at the age of 37.				 																																	Taffarel, who played in Europe for Italian clubs Parma and Reggiana and Turkish side Galatasaray, was offered a one-year deal by Serie A club Empoli but decided to retire.				 																																	I dont want to continue playing, I am quitting. I am doing this above all for my children, said the Brazilian. I am certainly leaving football but Id like to stay in Parma and Id like to open a restaurant here.				 																																	Taffarel was a hero for Brazil when they won the 1994 World Cup against Italy in the USA on penalties. 				 																																	Istanbul: Turkey has sold out all 42,000 tickets for a critical Euro 2004 qualifier against England next month despite relatively high prices, generating a record revenue of some $1.8 million, Anatolia news agency reported Friday. Fearing a repetition of the violence that has scarred previous games between the sides, the English federation has turned down its ticket allocation and has urged fans to stay away from the October 11 match in Istanbul.				 																																	The winner will qualify automatically for the finals with the other side going into the play-offs. 				 																																	Buenos Aires: The Argentine championship, suspended for 15 days following crowd trouble, resumes at the weekend with a high-risk match between two clubs whose supporters share a long, violent rivalry. Racing Club and Boca Juniors meet on Sunday in a fixture that has been marred by a history of hooliganism.

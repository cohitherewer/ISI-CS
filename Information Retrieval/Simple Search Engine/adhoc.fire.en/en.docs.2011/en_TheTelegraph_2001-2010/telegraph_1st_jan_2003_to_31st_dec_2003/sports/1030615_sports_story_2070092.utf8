The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ive been learning from John
 - England-bound India A coach Patil believes the preparation programme cant be faulted  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sandeep Patil (right) and John Wright Calcutta, June 14: Given his profile, coach Sandeep Patil is expected to receive as much attention as his India A players during their June 22-August 3 tour of England. Left to himself, he would be happy if the likes of Shiv Sundar Das and Avishkar Salvi alone were thrust into the limelight. However, thats probably easier said than done. Of course, a fortnight into his first India assignment in seven years and Patil is himself pretty upbeat. Initially, I was a bit apprehensive I wasnt sure how quickly I could adjust to a wholly Indian environment but, thankfully, I settled down in a couple of days, Patil, under whose guidance Kenya made the World Cup 2003 semi-final, told The Telegraph this afternoon. Speaking from Bangalore, where the preparatory camp concludes Wednesday, the coach added: That (Team India coach) John Wright and (National Cricket Academy bowling consultant) Madanlal have been contributing as a team has made it very comfortable Then, the facilities at the Academy are fantastic. Indeed, the approach has undergone such a change. In our time, the camps would be for four-five days  an eyewash, really. Now, even for a A tour, its an 18-day affair. Nobody, then, can fault the preparation. Patil, who worked with India A and the colts in the early Nineties, was also Team Indias coach (cricket manager, as the appointee was then designated) for six months in 1996. After a three-year break, he was back in business as the Kenya coach. That relationship ended when Patil decided on a return to his roots after the February-March World Cup. As Ive said, this assignment is yet another challenge and Ive been learning every day. In fact, Ive learnt a few things from John and have been specially impressed by the way he goes about the players mental toughness aspect. That appears to be his forte, he remarked. According to Patil, he has been focussing on fielding as thats an area where the scope for improvement is immense. [Incidentally, a Pune-based physio will be accompanying the squad.] Twelve of the 16 players have already played Tests or ODIs and, so, this is a chance for them to forget having taken that one step back. Now, theyve got to take that step forward and push the regulars. While doing so, though, their fielding must be top-bracket, Patil explained, adding that young Parthiv Patels case was obviously different. Parthiv, after all, is being sent exclusively to gain experience. He isnt, for example, in captain Shiv Sundars boat. The coach, however, declined to compare the A squad of the early Nineties and the present one. Look, the proof of the pudding is in its eating So, Im not going to sit in judgement merely after watching the players at nets. Lets see how they fare in England where, as you know, conditions can change by the hour, he pointed out. Patil, by the way, didnt agree that playing against the Counties only  there is no fixture versus England A  may not prove that demanding. More so, if the Counties dont field the best XI. Look, exposure to the Counties itself is an opportunity and the players must grab this chance. Moreover, because of the weather being fickle, England isnt ever an easy place to tour, he countered. Actually, its also an opportunity for Patil. Yes, it definitely is and Ill have to move forward Having said that, I do hope my renewal of the India links isnt limited to this one trip, he signed off. Patil, clearly, will be in the fingers-crossed mode August 3 onwards.  Copyright

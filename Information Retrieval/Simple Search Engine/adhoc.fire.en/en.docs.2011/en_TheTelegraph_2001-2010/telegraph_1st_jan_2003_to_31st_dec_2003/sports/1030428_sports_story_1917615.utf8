The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Viji best among women 
Mumbai: Grandmaster Nguyen Anh Dung of Vietnam won the Commonwealth mens chess tournament when he drew his tenth and last round match with Dibyendu Barua here Sunday. Dung finished with 8.5 points to his credit. Barua (7.5) finished fourth in the meet. Though Barua had the same points as Rustom Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and Evgeny Vladimirov of Kazakhstan the Indian GM was behind on progressive score. [In a rather unusual decision, though, Barua was declared the Commonwealth Champion, because Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are not Commonwealth countries, adds a Staff Reporter from Calcutta. Dung was declared the tournament champion though the tournament itself is called the Commonwealth meet. [The All India Chess Federation website said GM K. Sasikiran and GM Abhijit Kunte won mens silver and bronze, respectively in the Commonwealth part of the meet.] WGM S. Vijayalakshmi of India also finished on 7.5 points  she scored a smart victory over Kotronias Vasilios (6)  but was fifth overall on progressive. Vijayalakshmi clinched the womens Commonwealth title with the victory in her tenth round game. (PTI)  Copyright

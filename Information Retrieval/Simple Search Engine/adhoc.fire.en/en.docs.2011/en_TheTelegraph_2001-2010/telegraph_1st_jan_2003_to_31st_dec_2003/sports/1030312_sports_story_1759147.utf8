 Im quitting, no regrets: Andy Flower
Bloemfontein: Zimbabwe stalwart Andy Flower confirmed Tuesday he will retire from international cricket as soon as his teams World Cup campaign comes to an end. He insisted that he has no regrets about the black armband protest he staged, along with teammate Henry Olonga, to express his anger at the deteriorating political conditions in his strife-torn country. I have no regrets about what I have done at this tournament, said the 34-year-old batsman. The only thing I regret is getting run out when I had made 37 in the last match against New Zealand. That incident contributed to his teams six-wicket defeat which means Wednesdays Super Six clash against Kenya has become a must-win situation if Zimbabwe are to have any hope of reaching the semi-finals.

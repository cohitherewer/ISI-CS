The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shastri to coach SA
		 Ravi ShastriDurban, June 7 (PTI): In  a bid to make the national players media savvy, the South  African cricket team is hiring the services of former India  captain Ravi Shastri ahead of the series against England.  Shastri, who now works as a television commentator  (and is also a columnist for The Telegraph), will arrive  in South Africa next week to help coach young captain Graeme  Smiths wards the finer points of press relation. Smith, for whom the England tour will be the first major assignment since taking over the reign of captaincy from Shaun Pollock after the World Cup, knows very well what awaits them during the series. Thats why we wont leave any stone unturned to ensure were properly prepared for what awaits us. Ravi can tell us what to expect from the point of view of a player and the media, Smith was quoted as saying by a South African website. Smith made it clear he would like his teams relationship with the South African media to improve. During the World Cup, the relation between the local media and the South Africans had strained a lot following the hosts first-round exit. Smith also admitted that he was a bit nervous about the future series. We are a little afraid of what lies in store for us in England. We know were not going there as favourites. Its not a coincidence that we havent been able to win a series there since we were readmitted.  As captain its a great incentive to try to lead  the team to victory, said Smith.  Itll be different  Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta  adds: Shastri, who is immensely pleased at being  invited to South Africa, told The Telegraph: Its  going to be a very different experience and, honestly, I  should enjoy every minute.  According to Shastri, he is supposed to hold a one-day  clinic in Johannesburg next Friday and, being the pro  that he is, will reach there a couple of days before his  date with the South Africans.

 Viji scalps world champion
 - Asian Team Chess | Endian women  stun China to move atop table Jodhpur: S. Vijayalakshmi  beat reigning world champion Zhu Chen as the Indian women  scored a 2-1 victory over China to emerge joint-leaders  with Vietnam after the third round of the Asian team chess  championship Thursday. In the mens section, top seeds  China roared back to form after two ordinary rounds and  thrashed Iran 4-0 to join Vietnam at the top of the tables  on 8.5 points. The Vietnamese were involved in  a 2-2 draw against a spirited India C, who are sitting pretty  in third place just half-a-point behind the leaders. In  the fourth place is Kazakhstan on 7.5. The other Indian  teams in fray, A and B, are next in the order with seven  points apiece. While there was no surprise in  the mens section, the womens half witnessed something  sensational. Vijayalakshmi, the first WGM of the country,  scored a thumping victory over the world champion to script  a spectacular win for her team. The womens section looks wide  open by this surprising turn of events as China and India  C, who blanked Bangladesh 3-0, share the third place on  six points each. India B are in the fifth spot with 5.5  points. In the last World Cup at Hyderabad,  Zhu had suffered an unexpected loss to S. Meenakshi, younger  sister of Vijayalakshmi, and that must have been a major  booster for the former national champion. Playing white, the Indian faced  the Grunfeld Defence and it looked almost a one sided affair  once she launched an attack against the king. The white pieces appeared almost  in a frenzy to checkmate black and the Chinese did not have  a chance after some fine moves by Vijayalakshmi. An exchange sacrifice was followed  by a piece sacrifice by Vijayalakshmi that ripped apart  Zhus king side and the match over after just 36 moves. On board two, Nisha Mohota came  good and held Xu Yuhua to a draw while national champion  Aarthie Ramaswamy settled for peace against Hoang Qian to  complete the Indian win. In the mens section, India A  tried hard but faced stiff resistance against India B and  the result was a 2-2 draw that can be considered a very  satisfactory one for the latter. Leading the team from the  front was the countrys youngest GM Koneru Humpy who held  the mighty Krishnan Sasikiran to a draw. Double GM norm holder R.B. Ramesh  put it across GM P. Harikrishna to make sure that Tejas  Bakres defeat against Dibyendu Barua on board four did  not matter much. (PTI) Copyright

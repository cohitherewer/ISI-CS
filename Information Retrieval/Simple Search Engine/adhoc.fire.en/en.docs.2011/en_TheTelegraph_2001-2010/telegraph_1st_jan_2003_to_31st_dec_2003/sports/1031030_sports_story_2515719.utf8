The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain, Clarke steady England
Chittagong: Nasser Hussain and Rikki Clarke steadied England with an unbeaten century stand as they closed on 237 for four against Bangladesh after the first day of the second Test. The obdurate Hussain was on 47 and allrounder Clarke unbeaten on 53 after the visiting team had lost four top-order wickets for eight runs to slump to 134 for four. Hussain, concentrating on defence, had a life on 36 when he drove straight back to Mohammed Rafique, who injured a finger as he tried to take the catch. Four runs later the former England captain escaped again when edging through the slips. Clarke, batting as cautiously as Hussain, chipped slow left armer Enam-ul Haq (Jr) over mid-on for his eighth four to bring up a maiden half-century. The pair scraped together 49 runs in 28 overs in the final session. Put into bat, Englands opening pair had put on 126 before Marcus Trescothick (60), Michael Vaughan (54), Mark Butcher (6) and Graham Thorpe (0) all fell within five overs. England were without strike bowler Steve Harmison due to a back strain. They left out off-spinner Gareth Batty to include Richard Johnson and fellow quick Martin Saggers, who made his debut.

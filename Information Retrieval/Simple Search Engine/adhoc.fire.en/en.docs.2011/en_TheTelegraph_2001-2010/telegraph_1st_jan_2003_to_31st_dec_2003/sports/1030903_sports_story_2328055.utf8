The Telegraph - Calcutta
 For parents and coach: Vijayan 
Phagwara: I.M. Vijayan, who got the Arjuna Award for football has dedicated this biggest and most prestigious sports award to his parents back home in Kerala, the former national coach Sukhwinder Singh Sukhi and to his former coach Char Tulia. Vijayan said he will play more vigorously to justify the honour bestowed upon him. I have been hoping to win this award for the last three years.  (PTI)  Copyright

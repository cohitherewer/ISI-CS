		 Wednesday, January 29, 2003 				 Media may be prime target
																								Cape Town: Journalists and commentators intending to travel to Zimbabwe for the World Cup have been warned that they may be prime targets for militant aggression in the country.																								Movement for Democratic Change member of Parliament David Coltart said that hate speech in the country had affected certain sections of the community and journalists may suffer as a result. The world saw in Bosnia what can happen when hate speech is repeated often enough and I hear hate speech directed against Caucasians and Indians every day, Coltart said.																								Cup security chief Patrick Ronan admitted that there was no specific legal obligation to provide for the safety and security of journalists but added that he had drawn up a list of dos and donts.

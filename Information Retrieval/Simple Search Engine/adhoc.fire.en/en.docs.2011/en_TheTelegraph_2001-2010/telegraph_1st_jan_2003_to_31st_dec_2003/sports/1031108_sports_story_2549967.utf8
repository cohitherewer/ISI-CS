				 																																																	 The big guns of Bengal are going to give the state table tennis championship a miss this year. The six-day meet starting on Tuesday clashes with the Central Zone championship schedules, a fact which has resulted in the national-ranked players from the state committing themselves in the national meet.				 																																																	The Central Zone meet starts in Vadodara on Wednesday. The East Zone meet will be held at SAI here from November 19 to 23.				 																																																	Announcing this, the BTTA secretary Ashis Dutta informed on Friday that Ranabir Das, Sourav Chakraborty (last years state champion), Mouma Das, Mantu Ghosh, Poulami Ghatak and Anindita Chakraborty will not participate in the state meet, to be held at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra.				 																																																	In a depleted field, Arjun Dutta and Arup Basak have been picked as the first two seeds among men, while Samapika Paul and Sinjini Mitra will be their counterparts in womens category. 				 																																																	In all, 475 players from 16 districts (East Midnapore being the debutant) will be in the fray for top honours in ten categories of the Rs 52,000 tournament.				 																																																	 Former world billiards champion Manoj Kothari lost to Brijesh Damani 3-4 in the quarter finals of the state senior snooker meet at BRC. 				 																																																	Mudit Poddar beat Akram Khan in the other quarter final. 				 																																																	Having lost the first frame, Poddar staged a comeback winning the next four frames en route to his semi-final berth. 				 																																																	Damani won the first two frames, but Kothari fought well to draw level at 3-3. But in the decider, Damani was too hot for him.				 																																																	 Somak Palit and Shanker Roy shot up to the joint lead in the penultimate round of the Fide-rated chess meet being held at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra. Somak beat R. Balasubramaniam (8) to dethrone him off the leaders position while Shanker accounted for Suvrajit Saha. The current leaders are tied at 8.5 points.				 																																																	CHESS: Fide-rated meet at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra, final round from 12 noon.				 																																																	SNOOKER: State senior meet at BRC from 2 pm.				 																																																	SHOOTING: Inter-club meet at North Calcutta Rifle Club.

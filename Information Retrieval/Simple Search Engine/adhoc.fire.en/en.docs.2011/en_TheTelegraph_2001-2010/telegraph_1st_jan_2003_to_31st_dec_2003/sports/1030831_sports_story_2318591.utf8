The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Satyadev in semis
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tarundeep Rai at SAI on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Aug. 30: The semi-finalists in Olympic round, at the first national ranking archery championship (second phase), were identified on Saturday. In a surprise of sorts at the SAI Eastern Centre, three of the eight archers (four men and four women) who represented India at the recent world championship failed to make the last-four stage. Notable among those who lost out on a semi-finals berth was Limba Ram. Satyadev Prasad and Tarundeep Rai, members of the world championship team, made the cut along with Kailash and Jayanta Talukdar. Ved Prakash, the fourth member of the world championship team, is not taking part here because of a finger injury. Rai recorded the best score of the day  169 out of a maximum of 180. He also returned a 167. In the womens section, Dola Banerjee and Chekrovolu Swuro reached the semi-finals. Two of their world championship teammates, Rina Kumari and Bhagyawati Chanu, lost earlier. Sumangala and Bansara Lindhar were the other two semi-finalists in the womens section.  Copyright

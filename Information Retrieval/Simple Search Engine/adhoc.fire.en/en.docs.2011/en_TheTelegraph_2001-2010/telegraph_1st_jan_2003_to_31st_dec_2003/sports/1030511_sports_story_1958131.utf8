Arati, who passed away just after midnight (as reported briefly in Saturdays Late City edition), was 58 and leaves behind her husband, two daughters and countless admirers. Arati was cremated this morning at Nimtala. She was founder secretary of the state body and played a pivotal role in making womens soccer a mainstream sport in the country. Her contribution to the development of womens soccer in India was recognised in 2001 when the Fifa and the IOC presented Arati a certificate of appreciation.

Womens football is where it is only because of her, said Anita Sarkar, the first Indian woman to have obtained a coaching licence from the English FA.

 Bergkamp hits out at Nistelrooy
London: Rivalry between Arsenal and Manchester United spilled over to the fringes of the Dutch squad on Thursday when Dennis Bergkamp told Ruud van Nistelrooy that he deserved to be sidelined from the national team. United star Van Nistelrooy reacted angrily at being replaced during the Netherlands Euro 2004 qualifier against the Czech Republic last month and was axed for the next match. The spat has led to Van Nistelrooy starting on the bench for this Saturdays trip to Hampden Park, where Dick Advocaat will be hoping his Dutch troops can snatch a first-leg victory in their crucial Euro 2004 play-off against Scotland.

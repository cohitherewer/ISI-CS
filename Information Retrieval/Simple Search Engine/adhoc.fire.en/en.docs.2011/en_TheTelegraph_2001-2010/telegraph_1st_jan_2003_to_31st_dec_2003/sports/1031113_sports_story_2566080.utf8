The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Asgar Ali in lead 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Banking on a career-best six-under par 66, veteran city golfer Asgar Ali took the Day I lead at the Rs 8.5 lakh Servo Masters 2003, the eighth leg of the Hero Honda Indian Golf Tour (2003-04 season) at the Digboi Golf Links course on Wednesday. According to information received here, Asgars citymate SSP Chowrasia and Gast Ram were three strokes behind the leader with 69 apiece. Pappan and Zai Kipgen shared the fourth spot with a total of 2-under par 70 while five others  Sandeep Syal, Sanjay Kumar, Suleman Ali, Vishal Singh and Yusuf Ali  shared the sixth position. Asgar has, in fact, been advised by doctors for rest to overcome his back injury. But his passion for the game grabbed attention from the viewers and fellow competitors all through the day. After an early birdie on the third, he ended up with a bogey on the fifth. But he came back strongly firing a quadruple of birdies beginning from the very next hole to be four-under for the front nine. Asgar, however, played it safe on the back nine adding only a couple of birdies on the 14th and the par-3 16th which is the signature hole of the course.  Copyright

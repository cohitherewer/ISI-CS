Anaheim: Olympic champion Li Xiao-Peng defended his two titles in vault and parallel bars on Sunday as China finished with a flurry at the 2003 world gymnastics championships. Lis sterling show, combined with Fan Yes gold on the balancing beam, propelled China to the top of the medals table ahead of runners-up US. China had a total of eight medals, including five gold and two silver, to the US seven medals. The US also had five gold while Japan was third with two gold and two bronze. I feel I can do my job, said Li. I feel very confident and I trusted myself. Before the competition we werent sure how we would do as a team, said teammate Huang Xu. There was one tie on Sunday as Huang had to share the silver medal with Alexei Nemov of Russia. Huang and Nemov each had scores of 9.762. Li won the vault by an even bigger margin than the bars, scoring a 9.818 on vault to beat runner-up Marian Dragulescu (9.687). Fan Ye, whose point deduction in team finals cost China a bronze, redeemed herself by winning the balance beam gold. Brazils Daiane Dos Santos captured the first gold for her country at a world championships by winning the floor exercise. (AFP)  Copyright

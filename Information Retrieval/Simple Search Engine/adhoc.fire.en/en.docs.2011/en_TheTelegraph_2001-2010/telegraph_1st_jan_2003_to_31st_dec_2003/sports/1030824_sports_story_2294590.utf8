The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chelsea, United keep slate clean
London, Aug. 23 (Reuters): Champions Manchester United and Chelsea maintained their perfect starts to the Premier League season with contrasting 2-1 wins on Saturday. Manchester United recovered from a goal down to beat Newcastle United 2-1 with goals from Ruud van Nistelrooy and Paul Scholes at St James Park. Chelsea started brightly but were forced to battle for the points in their 2-1 win over Leicester City at Stamford Bridge as three players were sent off  Geremi of Chelsea and Leicesters Alan Rogers and Riccardo Scimeca. By then the match had been decided by a superb debut goal from striker Adrian Mutu who lashed the ball home on the stroke of half-time after picking up a re-bound from his own free-kick. Newcastle took the lead through Alan Shearer in the 26th minute. But United gradually took control of the match, captain Roy Keane scoring both goals in the second half.  Copyright

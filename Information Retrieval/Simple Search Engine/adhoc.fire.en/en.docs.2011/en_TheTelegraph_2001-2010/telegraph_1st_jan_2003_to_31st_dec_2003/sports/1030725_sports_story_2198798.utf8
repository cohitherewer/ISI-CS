 Rohan hits 61 as India A struggle
London: India A on Thursday struggled to reach 149 for six against Glamorgan in a three-day match on their tour of England. At stumps on a rain-shortened first day at Swansea, Parthiv Patel was batting on one at the end of 52.1 overs. A 116-run third wicket stand between Sridharan Sriram (62 off 127 balls, 6x4) and Rohan Gavaskar (61 off 126 balls, 8x4, 1x6) tried to repair the damage but to no avail. Both batted with composure and were selective in their choice of strokes. This was after the early fall of two openers, captain Shiv Sundar Das and Satyajit Parab. Both Das and Parab fell to seamer Harrison who returned with figures of two for 27 for the day. Parab fell for four while Das hung on for a not-too-confident 14. The dismissal of Gavaskar was followed by a middle-order collapse which saw four wickets fall for seven runs. Test spinner Robert Croft was the wrecker-in-chief for Glamorgan, claiming three for 45 from 16.1 overs. Croft first claimed Gavaskar. Parkin had Vijay Bharadwaj out leg before. Croft then trapped Hemang Badani plumb in front and then removed Sriram, out caught by Powell, to end a happy day for Glamorgan.  (PTI)  Copyright

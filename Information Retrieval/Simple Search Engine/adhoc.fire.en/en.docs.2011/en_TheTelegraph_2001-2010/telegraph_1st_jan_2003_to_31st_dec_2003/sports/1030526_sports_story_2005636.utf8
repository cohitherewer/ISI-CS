 Cathy Freeman finishes poor fifth

(AFP) Eugene: Mexicos Ana Guevara registered the best performance of the year in womens 400 metres, destroying the field in winning at 49.34 seconds at the 2003 Prefontaine Classic Grand Prix meet Saturday. Guevara beat runner-up Tonique Williams of the Bahamas (50.39) by more than a second to break the meet record of 50.02 set by Australias Cathy Freeman in 1998. Freeman, the 2000 Sydney Olympic champion, finished a disappointing fifth at 51.70. Guevara was undefeated in 2002, winning all 11 of her races, and ran the fastest 400 in six years, 49.16 seconds. Australias Jana Pittman had the previous best time of the year at 50.43. It was a little disappointing, Freeman said. I dont think it is any indication of what kind of fitness Im in. It was just one of those days where you are not quite on it. Stacy Dragila won the womens pole vault, beating Svetlana Feofanova of Russia, who is the world indoor champion. Dragila, of the US, jumped 4.62m on her second try, while Feofanova missed all three of her attempts at the height. St Kitts and Nevis sprinter Kim Collins proved his recent victory over Maurice Greene was no fluke, winning the 100m in 10.00. Collins, who ran a 9.92 earlier this year, beat Trinidads Darrel Brown while European champion Dwain Chambers finished fourth in 10.17. American Kelli White won the womens 100m in 10.96, just off the meet record set last year by compatriot Marion Jones.  (AFP)  Copyright

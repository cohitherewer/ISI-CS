The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arun Kumar, Sujith run riot
Bangalore: Sujith Somasundar smashed an unbeaten 150 while skipper J. Arun Kumar hit 106 as Plate B amassed 344 for two on the opening day of their Duleep Trophy encounter against Elite A here at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium Thursday. Openers Somasundar and Arun Kumar plundered 188 to build an excellent platform for a huge total. Amay Khurasia, who came in at the fall of Arun Kumars wicket, got out cheaply for four. Vijay Bharadwaj then joined Somasundar and the duo remained unseparated till stumps. Bharadwaj was unbeaten on 58 (eight fours). Sarandeep finished the day with two for 109. Bengal medium-pacer Ranadeb Bose, who shared the new ball with Irfan Pathan (jr), got to bowl just eight overs in which he conceded 23 runs. Jaffer hits 76 In Vijayawada, Elite B compiled 248 for four on Day I of their clash with Elite C. Opener Wasim Jaffer hit a strokeful 76. Opting to bat first, Elite B began on a sedate note with Amit Pagnis and Jaffer playing patiently and sensibly to put on 92 by lunch. Pagnis (49) got out in the first over of the post-lunch session. Jaffer went on to complete his half-century in the company of Vinayak Mane, the two compiling a 91-run stand. Parida and Kulkarni bagged two wickets each. summarised SCORES n In Bangalore: Plate B 344/2 (S. Somasundar batting 150, J. Arun Kumar 106, V.

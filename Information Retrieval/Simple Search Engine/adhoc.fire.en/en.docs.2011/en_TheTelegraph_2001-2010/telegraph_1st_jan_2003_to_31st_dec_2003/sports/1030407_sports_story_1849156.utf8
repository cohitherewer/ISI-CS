The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. top group 
Jamshedpur: Calcutta giants Mohammedan Sporting topped group B of the second division National Football League despite a goalless tie against Goas Haywards Sporting Club. With both teams already assured of berths in the final leg, the match was of interest only in deciding the group champion. Though Mohammedan Sporting and Haywards finished on 11 points, the former was adjudged group champion on the basis of better goal difference, having scored 13 goals and conceded just one. Haywards too scored 13 goals but let in six. In the lacklustre match at the J.R.D. Tata sports complex, both sides made several forays into opposition territory, but were let down by poor finishing. The Calcutta giants wasted some golden opportunities in the second half.

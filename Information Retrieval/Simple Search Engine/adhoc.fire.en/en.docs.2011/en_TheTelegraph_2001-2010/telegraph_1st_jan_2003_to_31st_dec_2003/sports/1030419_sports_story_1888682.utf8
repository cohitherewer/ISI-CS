The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bad day in office, says Sourav
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Dhaka: Sourav Ganguly is confident Sundays final against South Africa will be a different ballgame altogether. On the other hand, despite Fridays convincing five-wicket victory, Graeme Smith feels India will start favourites. It was just a bad day in office. Sunday will be a new game, Sourav said. Asked if he lamented the decision to play two off spinners, the Indian skipper retorted: Isnt it only natural. They are our best spinners. Even Avishkar Salvi has bowled well. Sourav hoped the return of Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh will change equations a lot on Sunday. Our batting was a bit brittle. We lacked the experience. An ecstatic Smith remarked that the victory was a big one. We are slowly starting to get things right. The guys are learning to live upto the pressure. We now have two consecutive victories in the hot and humid conditions. It does make one feel proud. We hope to keep improving and look forward. All the experience is going to come out on Sunday, he said. MoM Neil McKenzie felt that batting against the Indian spinners wasnt that difficult. There wasnt much turn. Some balls just tended to skid, he said. Coach Eric Simons also seemed satisfied with the performance. The guys got things right today. The more time you spend in the middle will help you adjust to the conditions better, the coach added.  Copyright

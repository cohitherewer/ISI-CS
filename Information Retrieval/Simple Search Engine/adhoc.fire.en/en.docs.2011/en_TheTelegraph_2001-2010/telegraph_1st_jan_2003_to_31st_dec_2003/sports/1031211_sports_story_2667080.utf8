The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bucknor shrugs off criticism
Melbourne: Steve Bucknor has dismissed media criticism of his umpiring sparked by his controversial decision against Sachin Tendulkar in the first Test against Australia last week. The Jamaican umpire raised his finger at a half-hearted leg before wicket appeal from Jason Gillespie in Brisbane, bringing a look of shock to the Indian batsmans face and a stunned silence from the Gabba crowd. Just recently I was umpiring the World Cup final so I dont understand what is happening, but at the moment I am pretty comfortable (with my form), Bucknor said in Brisbane. (The criticism) doesnt bother me. Mistakes are going to be made. I know that. Everyone makes mistakes including myself, added Bucknor. Tendulkar, who made a duck, had not played a stroke to the delivery in qu estion but television replays suggested the ball would have sailed over the stumps. Gillespie was walking back to his mark when Bucknor finally gave his decision. Commentators labelled Bucknors decision a disgrace, an insult and astonishing. Bucknor said he could not discuss the Tendulkar decision specifically. I give myself enough time to think about my decision, to replay just about everything about that delivery, and by so doing I should, in the end, be able to make that (correct) decision, said Bucknor, who has umpired in 84 Tests. Sometimes it doesnt go that way. Its not because my brain is working slowly. Media in Australia and India have been quick to recall how Tendulkar received several dubious decisions when India toured Australia four years ago. Fridays second Test is at Adelaide Oval where Tendulkar was infamously given out lbw to Glenn McGrath by Australian umpire Daryl Harper after ducking into a short ball which hit the batsman on the shoulder.

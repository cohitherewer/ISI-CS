 Asif tips to break ice
Karachi: Asif Iqbal Wednesday proposed tours by legendary cricketers as sporting ambassadors between Pakistan and India, saying it could serve as a catalyst to break the political stalemate between the neighbours. I think there should be tours by sporting ambassadors to Pakistan and India which can pave the way for a revival of bilateral cricket between the neighbours, he said. The likes of Hanif Mohammed, Zaheer Abbas and Imran Khan should tour India and collect feedback from people, and Indias Sunil Gavaskar, Bishan Bedi and Kapil Dev should come to Pakistan.

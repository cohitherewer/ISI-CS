 															- NZ TOUR AVERAGES				 	 SRINATH																								New Delhi: In an otherwise gloomy Indian performance, Virender Sehwag and Indian performance, Virender Sehwag and Jawagal Srinath stood out with their individual brilliance, topping the Indian batting and bowling averages, respectively, in the just concluded one-day series against New Zealand.																								Sehwag was not only the highest run-scorer from either side but also had the maximum average. His two hundreds gave him a total of 299 runs, almost double that of the next highest scorer, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming. Sehwag, who had an average of 42.71, was the only batsman from either team to have scored a hundred on the entire tour.																								Srinath was much more consistent than Sehwag and was the highest wicket-taker on either side. His 18 wickets from seven matches came at an impressive average of 11.16 and was only a shade inferior to New Zealands Andre Adams who took 14 wickets at 9.35 runs apiece.																								Yuvraj Singh and Rahul Dravid were the only other Indian batsmen whose aggregates reached three-figures. Yuvraj scored 114 runs at an average of 19.14 while Dravids 116 runs gave him an average of 16.57.																								Captain Sourav Ganguly scored 58 runs from seven innings at a woeful average of 8.28 while the case of Sachin Tendulkar was even worse. Tendulkar managed to score just two runs from the three matches he played after missing the first four one-dayers due to an ankle injury.																								Among the bowlers, Zaheer Khan also had a good series claiming 10 wickets at an average of 25.80.																								For New Zealand, Fleming had the highest run aggregate of 157 while Matthew Sinclair scored 146 runs.																								n Statistics tables on Page 18 (PTI)

 Bangla lose 18 wickets on Day 3
Dhaka, May 3 (AP): Bangladesh were on the verge of another big defeat after South Africa claimed 18 wickets on the third day of the second Test. Bangladesh resumed their first innings Saturday at four without loss and were skittled out for 102 at the stroke of lunch. Following on 228 runs behind, Bangladesh were 204 for eight  still needing 24 runs to avoid another innings defeat. Play was extended by 30 minutes following a request from the South Africans who hoped to wrap up the match Saturday only. But wicketkeeper Mohammad Salim (batting 24) and tailender Tapash Baisya (batting 8) ensured the visitors would have to take the field on Day IV.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latif urges fans to behave
London: Pakistan captain Rashid Latif on Sunday called on his sides supporters to behave during the upcoming one-day International series against England. Crowd trouble marred the triangular series with England and Australia two years ago, and fears of a repeat were heightened on Saturday when hundreds of fans jumped the fences and dodged stewards to reach the square following Pakistans five-wicket win over Leicestershire at Grace Road. This is very bad for cricket, I think, especially in Pakistan and England with the Pakistani crowd, said Latif. They love us and follow Pakistan cricket all over the world but it is not good for the cricket and I do not support that kind of thing.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A modern cricketer
 Michael Vaughans approach reflects his era London: If anything could shatter the cloistered calm of Londons gentlemens clubs this spring, it has been the new Wisden Cricketers Almanack. For the first time in 140 editions the primrose cover carries a photograph, a somewhat anonymous picture of Englands new one-day captain Michael Vaughan under a helmet. Traditionalists, some of whom appear to begrudge still the switch to over-arm bowling, predictably spluttered into their gin-and-tonic. The slim Yorkshire opener drives and cuts with an elegance reminiscent of Tom Graveney more than 30 years ago. But he is also a thoroughly modern cricketer, emulating the all-conquering Australians by launching into the attack from the first ball of the innings. Vaughan, 28, has looked the part from his first ball in Test cricket. Unhurried and unruffled with a fine technique, he always promised to develop into a suitable successor to the great Yorkshire openers Herbert Sutcliffe, Len Hutton and Geoff Boycott. Nothing, though, hinted at the feats of 2002. Vaughan took four centuries from the Sri Lanka and India bowlers in England with a succession of glorious strokes. He has been absolutely brilliant, enthused the doyen of commentators Richie Benaud. I am just captivated by the way he has come on this summer. The dapper Yorkshireman then mastered the mighty Australians on their own territory, scoring a further three hundreds in a losing cause.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

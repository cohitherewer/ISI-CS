Former opener Aamir Sohail heads the boards new selection committee. If we win in Sharjah, it will be a huge bonus, Samiul Hasan, a spokesman for the board said. We have to be patient with this young team, he said. He said the team was building the skills of its younger players to give them international exposure to prepare for the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies. Among the new players is fast bowler Umer Gul. All-rounder Rana Naved-ul Hasan and opener Muhammad Hafeez will also make their international debut.

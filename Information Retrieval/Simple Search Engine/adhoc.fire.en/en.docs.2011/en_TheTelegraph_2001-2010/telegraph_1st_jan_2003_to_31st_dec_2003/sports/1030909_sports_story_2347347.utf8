 Ramchand passes away
		 RamchandMumbai: Former India cricket captain G.S. Ramchand, who was admitted to a local hospital after heart complications, died on Sunday night. Ramchand, under whom India registered their first Test win over Australia in the 1959-60 home series, was 76 and is survived by his wife, son and daughter. Ramchand suffered a cardiac arrest in 1995 but recovered. He suffered a second stroke on August 4 this year and was admitted to the Hinduja Hospital before being discharged on August 20. On August 28, his condition worsened and he was again admitted to the hospital but never recovered. The funeral will be held on Tuesday after his daughter returns from the US. Ramchand, who made his Test debut in 1952 as an allrounder, represented India for the next eight years. Born in Sind, he was an aggressive batsman and a fine medium pacer. His best moment came when he led India against Richie Benauds Australians in the 1959-60 home series. Though the Australians won 2-1, Ramchand prevented a 4-0 washout. Ramchand played in 33 Tests. He scored 1,180 runs at 25.00, which included two centuries. He also took 41 wickets, his best being four for 49 against Pakistan in Karachi in 1954-55.  (PTI)  Copyright

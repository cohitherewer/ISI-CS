 MacGill wants to seal berth
Brisbane: Australian leg spinner Stuart MacGill wants to be known as an entrenched Test bowler and not merely as Shane Warnes stuntman. The four-match Test series against India will shape MacGills future with Warne returning from a 12-month ban in February before the three-Test tour of Sri Lanka. The 32-year-old MacGill is keenly looking forward to taking on the Indians for the first time and on Monday talked like a man who expected to be selected in Australias XI for the first Test at the Gabba, starting on Thursday. His position is in question with left-arm quick Nathan Brackens good form and Brisbanes pace-friendly reputation leaving the selectors to float the thought of a four-prong fast bowling attack. This series, whether I like it or not, is important in redefining me if you like, MacGill said on Monday. Im either the replacement or Im able to stand alone consistently. If I do well, or hold my own at least, against these guys I can be seriously considered as just another spin bowler rather than the stuntman. (Another) reason I want to do well is because they (India) are supposed to be the best players of spin in the world. MacGill has enjoyed a great career in his own right. He has 133 Test wickets at an average of 26.3 and possesses a strike-rate comparable to the likes of Dennis Lillee and Glenn McGrath. I think my ability to take the ball away from the right-handed batsman might be important considering most of the Indians are right-handed batsmen, he said. (AFP)  Copyright

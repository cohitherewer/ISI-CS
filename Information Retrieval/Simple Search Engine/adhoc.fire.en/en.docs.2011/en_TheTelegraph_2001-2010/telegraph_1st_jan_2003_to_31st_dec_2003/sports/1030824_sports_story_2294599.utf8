The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bajpai likely as new treasurer
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta, Aug. 23: Come the September 27-28 AGM and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will have a new treasurer. Moreover, given that joint secretary Jyoti Bajpai is tipped to succeed Kishore Rungta, yet another top post will then see a fresh face. With no indication of anybody seeking to challenge them, Jagmohan Dalmiya and S.K.Nair will continue as president and secretary, respectively, in 2003-2004.  Of course, it will be the third and last year for Dalmiya, while Nair will be in year No.2. Going by the rules, a secretary can call the shots for a maximum of five years  provided he gets the thumbs-up at the AGMs. Incidentally, the city will be hosting the annual conclave for the second year in succession. While the BCCIs constitution specifies the term for the president, secretary and treasurer, its vague about the joint secretary. Usually, the incumbent gets a maximum of five years, but Bajpai is about to complete six. No. Theres no question of another year (as joint secretary), Bajpai told The Telegraph, when contacted in Kanpur. However, he played safe when asked whether he would indeed be the next treasurer  at a time the BCCI has gone on the offensive to get its World Cup dues from the International Cricket Council. The AGM is still some weeks away and, so, Im not confirming anything. Its another matter that there has been talk I should take up that post, Bajpai remarked. Whatever his current stand, well-placed sources insist Bajpai will eventually move into Rungtas chair. In fact, Prof. Ratnakar Shetty and C.K.Khanna, key office-bearers in Mumbai and Delhi, respectively, are emerging frontrunners to succeed Bajpai. Some have also been speaking about Brijesh Patel. Only, he is already wearing two hats: Chief selector and National Cricket Academy director. In the next few weeks, then, it could well be Prof. Shetty versus Khanna. Though elections arent expected, the group loyalties wont exactly disappear and, as Mumbai is on the other side of the divide, the majoritywallahs may decide not to accommodate Prof. Shetty. On the joint secretary issue, at least, the lead-up to the AGM should see frenzied activity.  Copyright

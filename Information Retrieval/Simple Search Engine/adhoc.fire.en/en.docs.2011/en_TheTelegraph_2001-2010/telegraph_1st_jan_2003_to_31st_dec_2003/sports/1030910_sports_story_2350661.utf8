 Fifa order on Bagan again
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 		 Fifa has asked Bagan to  clear George Ekeh's duesCalcutta: After Isa Musah Eroje, Mohun Bagan have been rocked by George Ekehs complaint. And Fifa has taken action by ordering the city club to pay up $6,500, the amount due to the Liberian who donned green-and-maroon jerseys last season. Mohun Bagan assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury said that Fifas letter, asking the club to clear dues amounting to Rs 3.5 lakh, was received on Tuesday. Ekeh had complained to the Fifa on May 6 The matter will again be taken up by the status committee of the world body at its next meeting, Chowdhury said. This is a big blow for Mohun Bagan, at a time when they were trying to recruit some quality foreigners for the National League. Chowdury, however, is confident of exploiting his personal relationship with the Liberian to avoid any further Fifa axe. The moment I got the letter, I got in touch with Ekeh and asked him to settle the matter out of court, he said. The Liberian has promised assistant secretary he will try to settle the issue. Chowdhury, who has been entrusted the responsibility of looking after football-related matters by the court-appointed special officers, said he is even trying to get Ekeh play for the club in the National League. Ekeh told me he is currently negotiating with a Tunisian club, but that may not materialise finally, said Chowdhury. Meanwhile, the Isa Musah chapter is a closed one. I have sent his payment on August 22 and the case has been settled for good, Chowdhury added. The official added that the ban on recruiting foreign players will be lifted by October 11. The matter has been referred to the AIFF and the national body has sought clarifications on the issue from the Fifa.  Copyright

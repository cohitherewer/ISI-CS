 Police start investigation
Hanoi: Police in Vietnam have begun investigating reports of match-fixing involving two players during the recently concluded ASEAN Club Championship football competition. Vu Hang, head of the disciplinary section of the Vietnam football federation, said on Monday he has already met the two players who reportedly accused two other teammates of asking them to throw a match. He declined to give details. The Tuoi Tre (Youth) reported on Monday that hours before the ASEAN meet match between V-league champions HAGL and Indonesias Persita Tangerang. Two Vietnamese defenders told the team management that two of their teammates had asked them to help the Indonesian side win 1-0. They were reportedly offered $5,000 each. HAGL lost that match 1-2 but still advanced to the quarter finals where they lost to Thailands BEC Tero Sasana.  (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gradation yet to be implemented
Jaipur: Even though the Board of Control for Cricket in India has released more than Rs 12 crore in pending match fees to the national players, there are no signs of the much-awaited graded payment system being implemented in the near future. The graded payment system, which envisages different grades of match fees on the basis of seniority, has been accepted in principle by the BCCI, but kept in abeyance for a more detailed study. Sources in the board, however, said the system was unlikely to be implemented until the newly-formed Indian Cricket Players Association was recognised by the BCCI. According to the sources, as of now the ICPA consists of just a handful of players and the BCCI would talk only to a truly representative players body on this issue. Meanwhile, BCCI treasurer Kishore Rungta said cheques amounting to more than Rs 12 crore had already been dispatched to the 27 cricketers for their pending match fees. (PTI)  Copyright

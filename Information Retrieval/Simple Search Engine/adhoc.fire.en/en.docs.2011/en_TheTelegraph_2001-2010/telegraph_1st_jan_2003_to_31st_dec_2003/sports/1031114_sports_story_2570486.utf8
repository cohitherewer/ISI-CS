		 Friday, November 14, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Durban: A young black African cricketer in the eastern Cape region of South Africa has written his name into the countrys record books by scoring a triple century in a provincial B match. Dumisa Makalima, 22, a right-hander for Eastern Province B, scored 302 against Free State B in Bloemfontein in a United Cricket Board Bowl match.				 																																	His triple century came off 326 deliveries in his teams second innings total of 514 for five. He scored 61 in the first innings.				 																																	The CEO of the Eastern Province Cricket Board, Dave Emslie, says Makalima has great potential and he will be included in the top league soon.				 																																	Tehran: Irans Asian Cup qualifier against North Korea was abandoned on Wednesday night after a visiting player was injured by a fire-cracker thrown from the crowd, the Iranian Soccer Federation said on Thursday.				 																																	The incident occurred an hour into the Group D match at the 100,000-capacity Azadi stadium, minutes after Iran had gone 1-0 ahead from a penalty converted by striker Ali Daei.				 																																	North Koreas coach immediately ordered his players to leave the field in protest. About 20 minutes later, after the Koreans refused to return, the referee abandoned the game.				 																																	London: Britains John Higgins became the first snooker player to compile a maximum 147-break in successive matches during the British Opens second round in Brighton on Wednesday.				 																																	The 1998 world champion, who completed a maximum during last months LG Cup final in Preston, achieved the feat in the fifth frame of his 5-1 victory over Michael Judge.				 																																	As one of the top seeds, the world number four received a first-round bye at this event.				 																																	Ive had quite a few 147s in practice before I came here so I knew I was playing well, said Higgins, who earned 25,000 for the break.				 																																	New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan will lead the Carlin F3 team for the year-end Macau Grand Prix, featuring the worlds best F3 drivers.				 																																	The Indian has been asked to lead the three-car Carlin team at the ultra-demanding street track in the Chinese province after top racer Alan Van Der Merwe of South Africa opted out to secure a testing role in Formula One.				 																																	Nico Rosberg and Portugals Alvaro Parente are the other members of the team, which won the British F3 series this year.				 																																	Narain has a natural talent which is most perfectly demonstrated in fast demanding corners and at circuits like Macau where there is only one way to drive  with full commitment even into the totally blind corners, team boss Trevor Carlin said after selecting the Indian to lead the team. 				 																																	Buenos Aires: Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa appealed on Wednesday for his teams opponents to attack them.				 																																	It would make life easier if the opposition team attacked more, because creation uses more energy than destruction, he told a media conference. It would help us because it would weaken the oppositions defensive system.				 																																	Argentina can expect to face a massed defence as they take on Bolivia at home in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday.				 																																	Bielsas teamhave four points from two games in their campaign to qualify for Germany 2006. 				 																																	n Cricket, West Indies vs Zimbabwe  Second Test, Day III, live from 1.25 pm on ESPN n Cricket, Classics  India vs Pakistan, from 9 pm on ESPN n Tennis, Masters Cup  Live from 6.30 am (Saturday) on STAR Sports

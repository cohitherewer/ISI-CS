 Gough not in ODI squad
 David Graveney feels Darren Gough can be recalled for Englands tour to West Indies London: Darren Gough was omitted from Englands one-day International for the tours of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka announced at Lords on Wednesday. Yorkshire fast bowler Gough, 32, retired from Test cricket after the second Test against South Africa at Lords earlier this season but still made himself available for ODIs. But Englands chairman of selectors, David Graveney, announcing the squads, said that Gough could be on Englands tour of the West Indies in the New Year. Gough still remains a selection option for the second part of the winter in ODIs, said Graveney. However, as part of our planning for 2007 (when the next World Cup takes place), the selectors needed to look at other options bearing in mind the playing conditions in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In the Test squad, which will play two Tests in Bangladesh and three in Sri Lanka, England have included four uncapped players: Worcestershire off-spinner Gareth Batty, Surrey all-rounder Rikki Clarke, Durham all-rounder Paul Collingwood and Kent wicket-keeper Geraint Jones. The inclusion of Paul Collingwood and Rikki Clarke will also give us the option, where necessary, to strengthen our batting line-up still further and build totals which the captain can defend with what is a young and relatively inexperienced attack. England omitted seamers Martin Bicknell and James Kirtley, both of whom played in the 2-2 drawn Test series with South Africa concluded on Monday. Instead Yorkshires Matthew Hoggard, fit again after a knee problem, was preferred. Martin Bicknell and James Kirtley both made strong contributions in the recent Test series but Matthew Hoggard was preferred as we feel that his type of bowling will be most effective in the conditions we are likely to face on the sub-continent, said Graveney. Surrey batsman Graham Thorpe, who made 124 on his Test comeback at The Oval in Englands nine-wicket fifth Test win against South Africa and Durham fast bowler Stephen Harmison were both included in the Test squad.

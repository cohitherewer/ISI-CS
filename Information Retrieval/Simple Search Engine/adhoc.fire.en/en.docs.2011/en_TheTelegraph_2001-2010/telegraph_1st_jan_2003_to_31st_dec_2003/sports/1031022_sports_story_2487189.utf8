The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leander forced to defer visit
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Leander Paes city visit has been deferred by a day. He was forced to change plans after being held up in Goa where he was busy with a shoot. With heavy rains sending the shooting schedule haywire at Leanders ancestral home in Velim, he had to spend extra hours to complete the work. He returned to Mumbai late on Tuesday and was late for the flight to Calcutta. Leander is now scheduled to catch Wednesdays morning flight from Mumbai. Meanwhile, Dr Vece Paes, who cut short an Asian Cricket Council (ACC) work-related visit to Malaysia to be with Leander, suffered a freak accident on his way back, at a Bangkok hotel. I slipped and fell in the bathroom and landed on my wrist, said Leanders father, who is ACCs fitness training consultant. He hurt his ribs and an X-ray on Tuesday confirmed a fracture. I couldnt get up for half an hour and then had to crawl my way to the bed it was quite scary.  Copyright

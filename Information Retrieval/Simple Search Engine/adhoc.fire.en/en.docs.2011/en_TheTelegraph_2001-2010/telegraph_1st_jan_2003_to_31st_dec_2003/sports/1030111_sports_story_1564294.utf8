		 Saturday, January 11, 2003 				 Perfect sister act by Venus Williams
				 	 Venus: This was Serenas year																								Melbourne: Venus Williams got used to finishing second last year to sibling Serena in the most remarkable sister act in tennis history.																								Twenty-two year old Venus took to winning Grand Slams faster than year-younger Serena reeling off back-to-back victories in the 2000-01 Wimbledon and US Open.																								Venus was considered the better of the two Williams sisters when they emerged on the WTA Tour in 1998, but it was Serena who broke through for the familys first Slam title at the 1999 US Open. 																								From there Venus won four majors as Serena had to content herself with just one final appearance at the US Open in 2000 and then she was beaten by Venus.																								But last year Serena came of age in tennis and Venus took a back seat. 																								Venus, who had a 62-9 match record last year, has carried herself with great composure in those big tournament defeats, praising her sisters achievements, even though at her own personal cost. 																								She has had a great year, Venus said after the US Open final last September. Everyone has their year. This is her year.																								It was the 10th consecutive slam womens title won by an American, seven of them by the Williams family.																								Serena was just the better player. Im proud of her, Venus said. I did the best I could. I made a lot of errors. Maybe I could have played better, made more shots. But believe me it wasnt easy out there.																								Given the way they have dominated Grand Slam finals over the last year that looks a statistic soon to become a relic of the past. (AFP)

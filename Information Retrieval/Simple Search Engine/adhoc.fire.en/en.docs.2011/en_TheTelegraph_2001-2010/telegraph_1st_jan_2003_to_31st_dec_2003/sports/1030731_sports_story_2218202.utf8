 Kunte in joint lead
Edinburgh: Abhijit Kunte defeated overnight leader GM Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh to move to the joint top position in the 8th round of the British Chess Championship. GM P. Harikrishna joined Abhijit at the top of the tables with a hard-earned victory over compatriot and Commonwealth womens champion S. Vijayalakshmi. Both Abhijit and Harikrishna have 6.5 points each to their credit and will now meet in the next round. Half-a-point behind the two leaders were GM Peter Wells of England, double GM norm holder Tejas Bakre and Rahman while a pack of nine players including GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Vijayalakshmi were on their toes with 5.5 points apiece. Three more rounds remain to be played.  (PTI)  Copyright

 HC rejects Jadejas plea for return
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court Monday rejected allrounder Ajay Jadejas plea for return to grade cricket in view of BCCIs petition challenging Justice J. K. Mehra award setting aside the five-year ban imposed on him following the match-fixing controversy. Justice Manmohan Sarin, who had on May 16 issued notices to Jadeja, BCCIs investigator K. Madhavan and members of the disciplinary committee, agreed with BCCI counsel Kapil Sibals submission that the cricketers plea cannot be entertained unless the objections to the award were decided. The court is scheduled to hear BCCIs objections to the award on July 8 after the respondents file their replies. Earlier, a division bench of the court had on April 24 asked the BCCI to consider Jadeja for Ranji Trophy and posted the matter for hearing on May 19. However, when the matter came up for hearing, the bench sent the petition to Justice Sarin after BCCI counsel Radha Rangaswamy submitted that the award had already been challenged before a single bench. The BCCI challenged the Justice Mehra award on April 25, just two days before it was to become binding. The January 27 award would have become final on April 27 at the expiry of 90-day statutory period, had it gone unchallenged. Jadeja accused the BCCI of scuttling his selection in the Ranji Trophy by faxing a letter to the DDCA and advising the latter not to select him. He was also not allowed to take part in a charity match in South Africa as the ICC objected to his participation at the instance of the BCCI, his counsel P. P. Malhotra alleged.  (PTI)  Copyright

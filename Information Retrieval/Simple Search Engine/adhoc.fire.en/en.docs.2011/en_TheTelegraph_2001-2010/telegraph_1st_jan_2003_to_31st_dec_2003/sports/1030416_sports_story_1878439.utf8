 Smith should not lead, feels Woolmer
Dubai: Former South Africa coach Bob Woolmer thinks the teams new captain Graeme Smith is too young and inexperienced to lead his country. Graeme is a good cricketer, but I dont think he should be captain, Woolmer, who is in Dubai to conduct a coaching clinic for youngsters, said on Tuesday. Graeme is too young and hasnt done his apprenticeship yet. To be the captain of an international side, one needs to go through the apprenticeship period and do a lot of hard work to get there, he added. The 22-year-old Smith was appointed South Africa captain last month after Shaun Pollock was sacked following the teams poor showing as World Cup hosts. He became the second youngest captain in ODI history when he led his side on Sunday against India. South Africa lost by a massive 153 runs. His inexperience showed during South Africas match against India on Sunday in Dhaka when he decided to bowl Shaun Pollock after the 28th over, Woolmer said. I fail to understand the logic behind bowling him to late. A ridiculous decision indeed since Shaun is a wonderful bowler with the new ball, the Englishman added. Woolmer, the ICCs high performance officer, thinks there was no reason to sack Pollock. It was like disarming the team, he said. South Africa over-reacted to certain things that happened during the World Cup. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Soma 10th in Italy 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Soma Biswas, who put up a creditable performance Calcutta: Soma Biswas finished 10th in heptathlon at the World Combined Event meet in Italy. According to information received from her coach Kuntal Roy, the Asian Games silver-medallist tallied 5315 points. It was way below her personal best of 6185, but considering the alien conditions and the fact that she reached the venue the night before the meet got underway, it was a pretty creditable showing. J.J. Shobha, the other Indian in the fray, came 12th with 5285 points. A Ghanaian girl topped with 5952 points. The first day didnt go too well for Soma, who was part of the Busan Asian Games gold-winning 4x400 relay team too. She faltered in the 100m hurdles and was below-par in shot put also, thus lying in 15th spot. On Sunday, though, she made up some lost ground with a fine run in 800m to improve five slots. This was the first time two Indians had qualified for the World Combined Event meet. Somas next assignment will be the circuit meet in Delhi on May 18, followed by the Hyderabad Grand Prix. There will be two more Combined Event meet in June-July  in Austria and France. But Soma and Shobha havent yet confirmed participation.  Copyright

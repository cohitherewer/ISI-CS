The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Patil unhappy
London: India A coach Sandeep Patil is not happy with his wards for drawing their four-day game against Durham at Chester-Le-Street, and criticised them for not following a proper game plan. Patil felt his batsmen played too slowly in the second innings and the seamers were not up to the mark. It is not an acceptable excuse for our seamers to say that it was a flat pitch. They have to learn to adapt to any conditions if they want to have a Test future, Patil said on Monday. Also our batters were a little over-cautious because they want to please the selectors. We got into a good position in the first innings and I felt we could have accelerated. You have to have targets in mind and achieve them. We didnt do that, which was why the declaration (in the second innings) came late. The game ended in a draw after rain washed out more than a session of play with India A at 95 for three in their second innings after having taken a 149-run first innings lead. Patil praised Murali Kartik and Amit Mishra, who claimed seven wickets between them.  (PTI)  Copyright

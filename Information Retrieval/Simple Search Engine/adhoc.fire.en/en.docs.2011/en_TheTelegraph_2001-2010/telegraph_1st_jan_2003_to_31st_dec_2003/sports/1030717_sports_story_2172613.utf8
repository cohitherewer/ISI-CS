 Delhi HC reserves order on PIL
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday reserved its order on a PIL by former Union minister N.K.P. Salve and former cricketers Kapil Dev and Madanlal. The PIL, which also had former Punjab governor S.S. Ray as a plaintiff said that the ICC had imposed strict and unreasonable conditions in its contract with Indian players. A division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice A.K. Sikri, while reserving the order asked all the parties including the ICC, BCCI and the sponsors to file their affidavits on the maintainability of the petition within a week. The High Court had on January 22 ordered that no foreign exchange would be released to the ICC if the apex cricket body debarred India from playing in the championship or imposed any penalty or damages on players or the BCCI. However, the Supreme Court had on January 31 allowed the sponsors including LG Electronics India (LGEI) and Hero Honda to remit foreign exchange for the tournament, subject to the final outcome of the litigation. At the very outset, the court asked the petitioners counsel if the petition could still be entertained after the Indian team was allowed to participate in the World Cup. (PTI)  Copyright

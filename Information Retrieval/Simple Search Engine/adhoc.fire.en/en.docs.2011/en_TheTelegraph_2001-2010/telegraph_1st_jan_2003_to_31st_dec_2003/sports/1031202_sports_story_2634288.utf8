The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak rout NZ in 2nd ODI
 - Sami returns magical figures of five for 10; Razzaq slams 42 off 16 balls  Comeback man Salim Elahi top-scored for Pakistan in the second ODI in Lahore on Monday. (AFP) Lahore: Mohammed Sami rocked New Zealand with five wickets in 11 deliveries in Pakistans convincing 124-run victory in the second ODI on Monday. Sami, the 22-year-old right-arm paceman, skittled through the New Zealand tail with career-best figures of five for ten as the tourists collapsed to 157 in 38.5 overs in reply to Pakistans imposing 281 for six off 50 overs. Jacob Oram, debutant Tamma Canning, Paul Hitchcock and Brendon McCullum were all bowled by Samis scorchers. Opener Richard Jones top-scored for the tourists with 63 off 110 balls before Sami returned for his second spell and wrapped up the innings in quick time. He claimed four wickets in his seventh over without conceding a run and then finished the match by clean bowling McCullum in his next over. New Zealand, who made 291 in the first game before losing the high-scoring thriller by three wickets on Saturday, never looked to threaten Pakistans total once Chris Cairns was run out in the 28th over for 29. Jones and Cairns were involved in a 69-run fourth wicket partnership off 79 balls before the skippers dismissal. Jones departure in the 36th over triggered the collapse as New Zealand lost the last six wickets for just two runs. Earlier, Saleem Elahi returned to international cricket with a half-century and Abdul Razzaq belted an explosive unbeaten 42 off 16 balls after stand-in captain Yousuf Youhana had won the toss. Elahi, who last played in the World Cup, and half-centuries by openers Imran Farhat and Yasir Hameed helped Pakistan reach a strong total. However, it was Razzaq, who made rapid 47 off 22 balls two days ago, whose clean hitting took Pakistan to a tall total in the end. He hit four boundaries and two sixes as Pakistan made 103 runs in the last ten overs. Elahi was out in the last over when he drove uppishly to Daniel Vettori low in the covers after hitting six fours in his 69-ball knock. Elahi was included in the side after regular skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, due to play his 300th ODI, had to miss the match due to a throat infection. Farhat and Hameed laid a solid foundation and contributed 115 runs off 144 deliveries under perfect batting conditions. Vettori bowled an unchanged spell of ten overs and got rid of both openers. Hameed top-edged a sweep soon after completing his half-century while the left-handed Farhat holed out to Paul Hitchcock  one of the three changes in the visitors squad  in the deep after hammering eight fours and a six.

				 																																	Beijing: Hui Cheung-kwok, who won two gold medals in bowling in 1998 and 2002 Asian Games, Friday died of a mysterious illness, similar to SARS.

Unconfirmed report said before his death he showed symptoms similar to those of SARS victims.				 																																	Hui was the first Hong Kong player to win Asian Games gold medals in Bangkok and Busan.				 																																	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has so far killed 69 people in Hong Kong since March 12 while 1,008 are still admitted to various hospitals in the former British colony now under the Chinese rule.				 																																	Meanwhile, more than 20 arm wrestlers from China and Indonesia (countries worst affected by SARS) have not been cleared for the ongoing Asia-Pacific armsport championship in Guwahati.

Bourne was checking out the course for a race on Saturday in the Wanaka area, 200 kilometres from Dunedin, when the accident happened. He was still unconscious and in a critical condition, the TV station said. Baltrops condition was described as stable by Dunedin Hospital on Friday.

London: Ex-England midfielder Paul Gascoigne, who has been playing for a Chinese B-League team, is being treated for depression in a clinic in Arizona, his friend and adviser Jimmy Gardner said on Friday.

He said Gascoigne had not finished with the Chinese club, Gansu Tianma, but added: Of course he wants to play again in England.

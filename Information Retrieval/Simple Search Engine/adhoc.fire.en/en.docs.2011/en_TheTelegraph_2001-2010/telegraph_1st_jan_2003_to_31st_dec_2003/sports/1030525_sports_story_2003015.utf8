The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan face threat from sponsors
- COURT ORDER AFTERMATH BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta, May 24: Mohun Bagan slipped into troubled waters Saturday as their sponsors McDowell  amp; Company Limited threatened to withhold their promised amount for the forthcoming season following Fridays Calcutta High Court ruling.The court has ordered the clubs executive committee to keep away from matters related to football and it has also ruled that McDowell cannot form a company with the club. A three-member committee comprising Umesh Banerjee, Shyamal Sen and Indrajit Sen has been formed to look after football.After yesterdays ruling, we dont know where we stand, a UB Group official told The Telegraph Saturday.He made it clear that under present circumstances, the company has no other option but to withhold the money allocated for the coming season. The sponsors have already released Rs 60 lakh of the 1.55 promised.As per the present situation, ideally, we should ask Mohun Bagan to return that amount, the official added. He agreed that a part of the 60 lakh has already been spent on recruitment of players. But still, asking for a refund cant be ruled out.McDowell will also seek a clarification on their agreement with the club. We would like to know about the validity of our agreement and hence our rights, the official added.They will, however, wait for the court order before coming to a conclusion. We will take a wait-and-watch policy, he added.The official informed that they are eager to meet the three-man supervisory body. However, a member of that committee said he was no position to comment on the issue as he was yet to receive a copy of the court order.Its just that I have heard about it today. Lets see, what the court order says, said Banerjee.Mohun Bagan secretary, Anjan Mitra, is currently in Darjeeling and will be back on Monday. Our stance will be to ensure that there is no contempt of court. Also, we will try to protect the interest of the sponsors, Mitra said.  Copyright

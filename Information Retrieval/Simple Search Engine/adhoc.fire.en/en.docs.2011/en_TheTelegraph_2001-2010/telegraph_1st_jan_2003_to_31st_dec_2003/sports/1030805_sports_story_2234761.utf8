The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bopanna, Qureshi triumph 
New Delhi: The Indo-Pak pair of Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi won the $25,000 Challenger doubles event in Denver. The top seeded pair defeated Americans Josh Goffi and Jason Marshall, the second seeds, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, according to information received here. This is the first time Davis Cupper Bopanna has won a doubles crown outside India. He has quite a few titles in the Indian Satellite and Futures circuit. The tall man from Coorg lost in the first round of singles, thus failing to push his ranking up from 321. But the doubles matches served as good practice for upcoming events as well as the Davis Cup tie in Holland. The win gives Bopanna and Qureshi 50 points each and will push the former up by 20 places to 258 on the doubles ladder. Bopanna and Qureshi have also entered the Binghamton Challenger event, which is a $50,000 prize money tournament. The Denver win, however, prevented Bopanna and Qureshi from playing the singles qualifiers at Binghamton. Meanwhile, Megha Vakharias winning run came to a tragic end as she damaged the ligament of her right thumb and lost in the final of the $10,000 ITF event in Harrisonburg, US. Playing with a taped hand, the Fed Cup player went down to Shikha Uberoi of the US 1-6, 1-6. The runner-up effort gave Vakharia four WTA points.  (PTI)  Copyright

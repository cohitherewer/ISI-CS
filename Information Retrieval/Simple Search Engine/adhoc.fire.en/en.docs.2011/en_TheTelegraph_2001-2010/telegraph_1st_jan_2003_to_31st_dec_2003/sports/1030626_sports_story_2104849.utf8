The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Plans on to get Real
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: An effort is on, with various agencies working in tandem, to get the great Real Madrid to play a match in India, possibly in Calcutta. The talks are on, and while it just might turn out that some of the top stars will be absent, the soccer-crazy city will at least be able to see much of the talent from this star constellation which was added recently with the signing of Manchester United superstar David Beckham. The details of the event arent clear yet, but, following the once promise of Maradona by a state minister, fingers would stay crossed. This effort has been set in motion by ESPN-STAR Sports, with considerable input from the Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (ISWBM) which is celebrating its golden jubilee year. The institute is also one of few which has adopted a sports management diploma programme. Ashoke Dutta, director of the institute, refused to comment on the event, saying some details will be available Thursday. There is also a plan to bring Juventus along for the match. Things are likely to fructify in the next two months.  Copyright

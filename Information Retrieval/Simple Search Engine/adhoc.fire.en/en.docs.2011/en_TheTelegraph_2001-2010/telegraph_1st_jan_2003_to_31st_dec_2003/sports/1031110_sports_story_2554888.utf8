 Olonga feels hes finished
London: Former Zimbabwe Test pace bowler Henry Olonga has admitted that he will probably never play cricket again after undergoing knee surgery. I think Im finished, the 27-year-old told the BBC Saturday. Olonga, and teammate Andy Flower, won worldwide publicity earlier this year for their anti-Robert Mugabe protest during the World Cup when both men wore black armbands and issued a powerful statement denouncing the policies of the Zimbabwe government. He is now living in England after being granted a five-year visa and has no plans to try and play county cricket. Im not interested. If Zimbabwe were to change, I might consider a comeback but Ive still got to find the motivation and my biggest stumbling block at the moment is my fitness. Well see how my knee progresses. It is pretty worn, just from the years of playing, so Ill have to contend with that and whether I want to do further damage. Olonga, who first suffered knee problems in 2002, is now pursuing a music career. But he remains a vocal critic of the Mugabe regime. (AFP)  Copyright

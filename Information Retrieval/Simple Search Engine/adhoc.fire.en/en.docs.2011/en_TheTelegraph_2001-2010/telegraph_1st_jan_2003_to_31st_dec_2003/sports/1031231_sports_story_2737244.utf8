The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes comeback put off by two weeks
 - Indian ace to miss Chennai ATP meet  Paes is hoping to play the Australian Open and Davis Cup Mumbai: Indian ace Leander Paes on Tuesday ruled himself out of next weeks ATP Tata Open meet in Chennai as well as the Sydney meet thereafter, but said he could return to court for the Australian Open in Melbourne from January 19. Paes, who was expected to partner Mahesh Bhupathi in the doubles event at Chennais Nungambakkam Stadium, said he was disappointed to put back his return by two weeks. He took the decision to have more time to recover from the brain cyst which laid him low in August. It was diagnosed as a parasitic infection, forcing the doubles specialist to miss the last three months of the 2003 season. He has thus not played a competitive match for four and a half months now. I was looking forward to playing the Tata Open but now it looks like it will be the Australian Open that will herald my comeback. I have already talked about this with Mahesh, Paes, who is currently working to regain full fitness in Orlando, said in a release issued here. I have been practising hard for tournaments next season starting in January. I am disappointed to postpone my return and realise that it is a long and hard road back to the professional circuit. Nearly five months off the circuit is a long time in this competitive sport but Im sure I want to come back and compete at the highest levels of the game, Paes said. Paes, who partnered Martina Navratilova to the mixed doubles crown in the last Australian Open, said he is now focussing on defending that title with the legendary American and fulfilling his responsibility in playing for the country in Davis Cup. India take on New Zealand in an Asia-Oceania zone group I first-round tie in Invercargil (near Christchurch) from February 6-8 with Paes making his debut as captain.  (PTI)  Copyright

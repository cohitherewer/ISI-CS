The game, it may be recalled, ended in one of the biggest upsets with the 1996 champions losing by 53 runs. The concerned broadcaster has already been asked to provide the tapes... In fact, the request was made early Tuesday, informed a well-placed source of The Telegraph. Its to be seen whether Sir Paul Condon and his team decide on further action.  Copyright

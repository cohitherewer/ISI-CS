		 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Murali may go Warnes way
				 	 MURALI																								Melbourne: Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan believes he will follow Shane Warnes lead and retire from one-day cricket to concentrate on Tests.																								I only ever get injured playing one-day cricket, never Tests, Muralidharan was quoted in The Age on Thursday.																								Im only 30 now, but I think in maybe one or two years after the World Cup I will do the same thing as Warnie (Shane Warne).																								I will speak to my parents and some former Sri Lankan captains about it, he said. It depends how I feel, but I think this is probably my last time (touring Australia). I hope to put the No Australia tours clause in my next contract, and then thats it. (REUTERS)

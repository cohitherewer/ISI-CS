The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No. 23 breaks all records
 Beckham puts all recent Real signings in shade Madrid: England captain David Beckham broke all records for replica shirt-sales on his first day as a Real Madrid player, the club told reporters on Thursday. Club officials said its main souvenir shop alongside the Santiago Bernabeu sold 8,000 shirts No. 23 in little more than the seven hours on Wednesday. Two hundred were sold in the first hour after Beckham had formally been presented with his new jersey by Real Madrids honorary president and legendary striker Alfredo di Stefano. Then the numbers started to rocket once news spread around the Spanish capital that Beckhams shirt was in stock. Even the second and third team shirts, in black and grey, were gone by Wednesday evening. Real said that by the close of trading Wednesday, the shop had exhausted its initial supply of Beckhams shirt. To put Beckham on your back is not cheap. Real Madrids replica shirts are the most expensive of any club in the Spanish first division and cost 78 euros each, which is 54 for any English visitor. Beckhams first day sales put all the other recent big signings in the shade. On the first day that Ronaldo joined Real Madrid, 2,000 shirts had been sold. In 2001, only 300 shirts with Zinedine Zidanes name and number were sold on the first day after the Frenchmans world record transfer from Juventus was formally completed. Not a single Luis Figo shirt was sold on his first day, owing to the fact that there was none in stock after problems with the delivery from the manufacturers. Beckhams shirt sales will please Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, who has always admitted that he signed the former Manchester United player as much for his commercial pulling-power as his ability with the ball at his feet. Perez hopes that part of Beckhams 35 million euros transfer fee will be paid off by replica shirt sales in the Asian market, where Beckham is even more of an icon than he is in Europe. Counterfeit shirt manufacturers were also quick off the mark. Beckhams shirts were already on sale by Wednesday evening in tourist traps such as Madrids Puerta del Sol, where street traders  usually illegal immigrants  display their wears on blankets strewn across the pavement. One street trader was prepared to sell AFP  after some haggling  a slightly flawed pirate copy of Beckhams replica shirt for 18 euros, less than a quarter of the price of the official version.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Demand outstrips supply
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Interest among the public in Thursdays India A-Pakistan A match stumped the organisers. While about 40,000 turned up at the Eden (25,000 of them holding priced tickets), many more returned dejected as there were not enough tickets. Reacting promptly, the CAB has decided to open blocks B1, K1 and L1 for Sundays Indo-Pak clash and also for the final slated for Tuesday. This would accommodate about 25,000 more. All these will be priced tickets.  TV replay blues Doordarshan, broadcasting the meet live, was caught on the wrong foot twice during the Indo-Pak match Thursday. A run out decision concerning Sanjay Bangar and a catch claimed by Mohammed Kaif against Naveed Latif were referred to the third umpire. Third umpire K. Hariharan could not be provided with any conclusive shots which resulted in the official giving the benefit of the doubt to the batsmen on both occasions. It may be possible that Doordarshan didnt have enough cameras in the right places. Its not known whether this has drawn displeasure from the teams concerned.  Copyright

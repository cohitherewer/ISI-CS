The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vettori: All India trips have been educative
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Daniel Vettori Chandigarh: By now, Daniel Vettori has become an India-veteran. Yet, for him, this business of learning never stops. Yes, all my trips have been educative... Actually, for any spinner, touring India is the hardest part of his career... Why? Because the batsmen are such good players of spin... Vettori remarked, during a brief interaction with The Telegraph after a Media conference in Mohali. Now 24, Vettori accepted he was relieved that regular captain Sourav Ganguly wasnt leading in the second (and deciding) Test. But, he quickly added: Having said that, its not that Ive found it easy... I mean, all batsmen are so good at tackling spinners... Its such a challenge... Earlier, Vettori emphasised that his role was primarily restrictive. Im not a big turner, nor do I have plenty of variety... My role, then, is to restrict. Once the runs dry up, the wickets will follow... Incidentally, this left-arm exponent didnt read much into Sachin Tendulkars lack of touch and quipped: Yeah, the last time everybody spoke about him being out of form, he replied with 144 (in the previous Test in Mohali)... So... On Sunday, though, Vettori prised out Sachin with little difficulty. Reflecting the mood in the New Zealand camp, Vettori is hopeful of an upset on the fifth and final day of the current Test.

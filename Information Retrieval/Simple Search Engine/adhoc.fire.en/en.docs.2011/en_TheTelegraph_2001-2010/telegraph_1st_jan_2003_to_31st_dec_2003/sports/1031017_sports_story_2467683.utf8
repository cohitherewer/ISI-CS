 Kallis wants to do it for dad
Lahore: South Africas Jacques Kallis, wanting to continue a run of good form in honour of his father who died in July, is looking forward to the two-Test series against Pakistan starting on Friday. His memories still linger on in the mind, the top allrounder said on Thursday. It is easier said than done that you get on with life. But I keep on going knowing the old man would have wanted me to go out and perform to the best of my ability for South Africa. He added: I am looking forward to locking horns with the quality Pakistan bowlers. You cant count Pakistan out of the series even if they lost the one-dayers. They can produce unbelievable results. Kallis said: Quality fast bowling always gets me going and the boys are also very confident after the way we came back from the death in the one-day series. (Reuters)  Copyright

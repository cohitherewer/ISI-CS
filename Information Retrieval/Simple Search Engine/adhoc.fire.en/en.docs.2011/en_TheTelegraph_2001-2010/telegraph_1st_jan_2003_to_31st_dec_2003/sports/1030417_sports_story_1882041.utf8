 Fisichella to get Interlagos trophy in Italy
London: Italys Giancarlo Fisichella will have to close his eyes Friday and pretend that Imola is Interlagos. Nearly two weeks after the Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix, the Jordan driver will be handed a winners trophy that was carried away from the Sao Paulo circuit by McLarens championship leader Kimi Raikkonen. The international automobile federation (FIA), which sorted out the mess last Friday when Fisichella was belatedly declared the winner, said Wednesday that the Roman would receive the trophy at Imola ahead of Sundays San Marino Grand Prix. Fisichella, deprived of the joy of a podium celebration after recording his first win in 110 starts, will be handed the trophy in a short ceremony on the circuits start-finish line. Eddie Jordan, whose team was marking its 200th Grand Prix at Interlagos and saw justice prevail when a timing error was unearthed, will be present as Raikkonen and McLaren boss Ron Dennis hand over the trophy.

 Eight Premier League players in rape probe
 London: Eight unnamed Premier League players  were at the centre of a probe into the alleged gang rape  of a 17-year-old girl, The Sun newspaper said on  Monday.  The newspaper said the girl had consented to sex with  one of the players at a London hotel but seven other players  joined in against her wishes. Westminster Sapphire have received an allegation of rape. At this point it would be inappropriate to comment further,said a Scotland Yard spokesman said. The players were not named, but were said to include at least one international and several other household names.  All seven play for the same club. The other player,  with whom the girl was willing to have sex, plays for another  club. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangladesh humiliated by Canada
  Bangladesh skipper Khaled Mashud snaps up Joe Harris in Durban Tuesday. (AFP) Durban: Minnows Canada pulled off the first major upset of the World Cup Tuesday, beating Test nation Bangladesh by a comfortable 60 runs in their opening Group B match. Although Canada slumped after a positive start to be bowled out for a modest 180, their bowlers cashed in on a bouncy pitch to dismiss Bangladesh for just 120 in 28 overs. This was just the fifth instance of Test-playing nation losing a World Cup game against a non-Test playing team. Earlier, Sri Lanka beat India in 1979, Zimbabwe shocked Australia in 1983, Kenya stunned West Indies in 1996 and Bangladesh surprised Pakistan in 1999. Hannan Sarkar and Sanwar Hossain, who both made 25, were the only batsmen to offer resistance as the Canadians backed up some accurate out-swing bowling from the dreadlocked Austin Codrington, who took five wickets for 27. Ian Billcliff top-scored for Canada with 42.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

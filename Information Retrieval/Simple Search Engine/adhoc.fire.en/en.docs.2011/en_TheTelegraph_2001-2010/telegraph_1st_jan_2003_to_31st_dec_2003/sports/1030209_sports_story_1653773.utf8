 Indians still a dangerous bunch: Pollock
 Cape Town, Feb. 8 (PTI): South African captain Shaun Pollock has said Indias strong batting line-up posed a serious threat to other participants in the World Cup, despite their poor show in New Zealand. They may have had their failures in recent times but it remains potentially a very dangerous batting line-up, said Pollock who had still not forgotten the two ICC Champions Trophy semi-final defeats to India in Kenya and Sri Lanka. I remember from my past experience they are a dangerous bunch of customers. They did it to us in Kenya and Sri Lanka, and they batted brilliantly well when they toured here last time (in 2001), he said. The hosts captain in particular remembers Sourav Ganguly for some astonishing hitting in the one-dayers, smashing no less than 14 sixes in the triangular Standard Bank tournament of 2001-2002. Sourav showed he had a freakish sense of timing, commented Pollock about his Indian counterpart.  Copyright

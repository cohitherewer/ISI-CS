 Gayle hits form
 Chris Gayle Bridgetown: West Indies opener Chris Gayle, left out of the first two Tests against Australia because of confusion over eligibility rules, said on Saturday he was glad to be back and he had found new motivation in his absence. Gayle made 71 on his return as he shared a first-wicket partnership of 139 with Devon Smith in the third Test.He was batting on 56 in the second innings at tea on Day IV. Im not out to prove anything, all I want is to play cricket for the West Indies and represent the team, he said. When I was dropped, I used that to set myself some targets in these two Test matches. I really trained hard and so far Im pleased with myself.  (Reuters)  Copyright

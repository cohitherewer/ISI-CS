 Henry voted PFAs Player of the Year
 Thierry Henry with the PFA trophy on Sunday London: Arsenal striker Thierry Henry was named the English Professional Footballers Association (PFA) Player of the Year on Sunday. The Frenchman has enjoyed a rich vein of form this season, scoring 22 Premier League goals in Arsenals bid for a second straight league and cup Double. This means a lot to me because the other players have voted for me, Henry said. They all know better than anyone else because they play against me and they must have noticed something, so Im happy they have noticed something. Its never easy when you come from another country to get people to like you but, at the end of the day, the most important thing is football, no matter which country you are from. Three of the 25-year-old Henrys strikes have been voted goal of the month  against West Ham United, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City  making him the first player to achieve the feat thrice in a season. Henry took the honour ahead of Paul Scholes, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Gianfranco Zola and James Beattie. Henry breaks three years of Manchester United domination of the award. Roy Keane took the vote in 2000, Teddy Sheringham, now with Tottenham Hotspur, won it in 2001 and Van Nistelrooy 12 months ago. The last Arsenal player to take the PFA award was Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp in 1998. Arsenals Irish midfielder Liam Brady won it in 1979.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

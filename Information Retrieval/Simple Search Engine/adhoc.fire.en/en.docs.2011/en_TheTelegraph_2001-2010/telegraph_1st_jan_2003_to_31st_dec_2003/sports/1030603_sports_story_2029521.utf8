 Miandads own story 
Islamabad: Pakistan coach Javed Miandad has launched his autobiography, outlining his rise from the streets of Karachi into portals of international cricket. The book, titled Cutting Edge: My Autobiography and published by Oxford University Press, was formally launched in Karachi on Sunday by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia. Miandad said at the launch that the purpose of writing this autobiography was to narrate his side of the story since many people had misunderstood him. I wanted to express my feelings in this book since I had experienced a lot of difficulties during my career. I wish the current players do not go through the ordeal that I had to face.

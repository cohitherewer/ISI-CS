The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Draw puts SAI in trouble
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: Sports Authority of India (SAI) Eastern Centre, Calcutta squandered a number of chances before being held to a goalless draw by St. Ignatius of Gumla, Jharkhand, in a group 8 league match of the 2003 Subroto Mukerjee Cup football tournament on Friday. The draw has put the Calcutta sides route to qualifying for the knock-out quarter final stage a little troublesome. At present both the SAI outfit and St. Ignatius are level on four points from two matches. The Calcutta side has a better goal difference of plus seven, as compared to their opponents plus four. However, in their concluding matches on Saturday, SAI face a tougher opponent, Sanjay Public School, Chandigarh. In contrast, the 1993 Subroto Cup champions St. Ignatius meet Chopasni Senior Higher Secondary School, Jodhpur, which have lost both their previous matches by large margins. The Jodhpur school lost 0-7 to the SAI outfit on Thursday and were beaten 0-10 by Sanjay Public school, Chandigarh on Friday. SAI coach Uttam Ghosh later lamented the absence of ace striker Bablu Rahman, who missed the tie due to a knee injury.  Copyright

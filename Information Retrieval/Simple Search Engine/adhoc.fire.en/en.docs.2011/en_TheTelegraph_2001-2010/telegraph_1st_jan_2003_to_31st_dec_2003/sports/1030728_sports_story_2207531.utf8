 Steve hits 32nd century
 - second test l Bangladesh need another 155 to make Australia bat again  Matthew Hayden takes a catch to dismiss Hannan Sarkar on the third day in Cairns on Sunday. (AFP) Cairns: Australia captain Steve Waugh scored his 32nd century in the second Test against Bangladesh on Sunday as Australia moved within six wickets of a 2-0 series sweep. Waugh declared at 556 for four at tea on the third days play, in reply to Bangladeshs first-innings 295. Australias bowlers then reduced Bangladesh to 106 for four before close with the visitors requiring another 155 to make Australia bat again. Sanwar Hossain on six and Alok Kopali on 10 were the batsmen at the crease. Hannan Sarkar hit eight boundaries in his 55 and put on 75 for the second wicket with Habibul Bashar (25) before Bangladesh lost both batsmen and Mohammed Ashraful (0) in seven balls for three runs. Waugh hit his second successive hundred, reaching 156 not out to move into second on the all-time centurions list behind Indias Sunil Gavaskar (34). Sachin Tendulkar is third on 31. 			The 38-year-old Waugh was involved in two major partnerships, including an unbeaten fifth-wicket stand of 174 with Martin Love who made 100 not out, his maiden Test century. Waugh also added 250 for the fourth wicket with Darren Lehmann, who was out for his highest Test score of 177 in the morning session. Resuming on 351 for three, Australia added 104 runs for the morning session and a further 101 after lunch. His 233-minute partnership with Waugh, who hit 17 boundaries, ended when Lehmann backed away and played a lofted drive to cover off Tapash Baisya and was caught by Ashraful. Love scored an elegant hundred off 154 balls with seven boundaries before Waugh immediately declared after 139.2 overs of suffering for Bangladesh. Australias total was the highest conceded by Bangladesh in their three-year history in Tests, beating Sri Lankas 555 for five declared in Colombo in September 2001. It was the seventh time Bangladesh had conceded 500 or more in an innings. Waugh, the games most-capped player and most successful captain, has hit four Test centuries this year and opposing players rushed to shake his hand at the change of innings on Sunday. Waugh and Lehmann scored hundreds in last weeks first Test. Australia lead the two-match series 1-0 after Bangladesh, who have not won a Test in 20 attempts, lost the first Test inside three days by an innings and 132 runs in Darwin last week. Procter returns home International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referee Mike Procter returned home to South Africa following the death of his father, officials said on Sunday. The former Test player was the ICC Match Referee for the first two days of play in the second Test in Cairns between Australia and Bangladesh this week. Procter will not take any further part in the match and will be replaced for the remaining days of the Test by former Australian allrounder and current Cricket Australia Code of Behaviour Commissioner Ron Archer, Cricket Australia said in a statement.

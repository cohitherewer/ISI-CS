The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ill be back: Barreto
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Barreto wants to see Bagan at the top Calcutta: There is hope at the end of the tunnel for Mohun Bagan. No, this is not emanating from anything abstract, make-belief world of a club plunged into utter confusion and chaos, but from a players promise and self-belief. It is more valuable and, therefore, trustworthy. Almost four years with the national club of India and Jose Ramirez Barreto has seen both sides of the coin. From being the top-scorer of the National Football League to helping his team win it twice to his failures in the current season, which he has described as the worst-ever. But in the Brazilians professionalism, also exists an intense passion and a point to prove his priorities. Out of such priorities, probably came with his announcement on Wednesday that he would don the green-and-maroon jersey for another year. This is not the right time to leave Mohun Bagan, Barreto told reporters after Mohun Bagans 3-3 truce with relegated ITI of Bangalore at Salt Lake Stadium and his departure for Brazil. Ill come back and want to give off my best, want to see my club at the top again, he felt. It was a feeling Barreto never tried to hide under the wraps of professionalism. Listen to his words again: So many people love me here.  So many things Ive got from this club. I really wanted to give the club all I could. But I couldnt. But there is also a tomorrow, a future, and Im looking forward to it. I want to see Mohun Bagan come out of the present situation. Because this is not only bad for the club, but for Indian football as a whole. Meanwhile, it was learnt that Bagan also managed to rope in Tollygunges Ashim Biswas.  Copyright

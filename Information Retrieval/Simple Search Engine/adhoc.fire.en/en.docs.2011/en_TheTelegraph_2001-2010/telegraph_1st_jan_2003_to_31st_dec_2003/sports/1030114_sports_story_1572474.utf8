		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Lanka ride another Sanath ton
				 	 Jayasuriya: 106 off 110 balls																								Sydney: Sri Lankas resurgence in the tri-series continued on Monday with a 31-run win over England as off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan became only the fourth bowler to claim 300 wickets in both Tests and one-day Internationals.																								The only other bowlers to achieve the double are Pakistan frontline seamers Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble.																								Sri Lanka scored 284 for seven in their 50 overs before dismissing England for 253 in 49.2 overs. Muralidharan took one for 36 from his 10 overs, bowling tailender Jimmy Anderson for one as England again failed to build on a century opening stand.																								Sri Lankas win, their second in succession after starting the series with three straight losses, keeps them in contention for the finals with 12 points. Australia have 22 from five games with England on 14 from six.																								Sri Lanka captain Sanath Jayasuriya won the toss and batted, hitting his second successive century as Sri Lanka smashed 284 for seven. It was the left-handers 15th century in his 277th one-day International and he put on 144 for the second wicket with Hashan Tillekeratne, who made 44.																								Maravan Atapattu was out for a sixth-ball duck in the first over of the match. 																								Jayasuriya reached his hundred off 94 balls and was out for 106 in 110 balls including 15 fours and one big six over point off Stephen Harmison.																								Wayward again																								The lanky paceman was again wayward with nine wides in his spell of nine overs, conceding 59 runs for no wicket which included 14 off his first over, although Sri Lanka had to negotiate two tight spells from Andy Caddick, who took two for 29.																								The Somerset fast bowler had Atapattu caught at slip in the first over and returned to dismiss De Silva in the 47th over for 51 from 59 balls. Nick Knight (42) and Marcus Trescothick, who was run out for 85, made 115 for Englands first wicket, their second successive century stand.																								But England then lost five wickets for 64.																								Shah made 39 before he became one of De Silvas four victims. The 37-year-olds four for 30 was his career-best but he was pipped by his captain for the Man of the Match award.																								While Muralidharan was at times unplayable on Monday, De Silva was also a key weapon. He was on a hattrick when he had Shah caught and Ronnie Irani caught and bowled for two in the 44th over with the score on 227 for eight. (REUTERS)

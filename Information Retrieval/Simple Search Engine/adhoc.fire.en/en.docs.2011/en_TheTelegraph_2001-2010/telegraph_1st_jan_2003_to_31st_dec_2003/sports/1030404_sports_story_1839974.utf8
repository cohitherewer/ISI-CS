 Boom or bust time for United
Manchester: Alex Fergusons bid to avoid two years without a trophy faces an 11-day examination that could make or break Manchester Uniteds season. United play Liverpool, Newcastle United and Arsenal in the Premier League and Real Madrid in the Champions League between this Saturday and April 16. It is going to be a big month. Liverpool at home, Newcastle and Arsenal away, said Ferguson. They are fantastic games and we have a quarter-final of the Champions League in between. Arsenals recent defeat by Blackburn Rovers has left United just two points behind the title holders with seven games left. Victories over Liverpool and Newcastle will ensure United move at least one point in front of the leaders if they then win at Highbury on April 16. If we win our remaining games we win the league, Ferguson said. Its not quite as easy as that, but thats the factual situation. Its not easy at the end of the season, points can be dropped. But the important thing is that we dont drop as many points as our opponents, and if we do that then we have a chance. The task starts with Saturdays match against Liverpool, with Gerard Houlliers side having won their previous three Premier League games to end a poor run of results. Liverpool appear to have the measure of their rivals. Uniteds only win in the last seven meetings over the past three seasons came at Anfield in December and Liverpool beat United 2-0 in the League Cup final a month ago. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Injured Shoaib out for 3 weeks
 - Richie Benaud to hear PCB appeal
 London: Former Australia captain Richie Benaud  will hear Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars appeal against  his one-Test and two ODI ban for breaching the ICC Code  of Conduct, even as the Rawalpindi Express was ruled out  for three weeks after straining a hamstring during the first  Test against South Africa in Lahore Monday.  Benaud, now an esteemed broadcaster and Cricket Australias  nominated member of the ICCs Code of Conduct Commission,  has been appointed as appeals commissioner for Shoaibs  case by ICCs legal counsel, Urvasi Naidoo. Shoaib was banned for using foul language against South African tail-ender Paul Adams during the first day of the first Test in Lahore last Friday. If the ban is upheld, Shoaib will miss the second Test against South Africa in Faisalabad starting from October 24 and the first two games of a five-match home one-day series against New Zealand next month. Meanwhile, in Lahore Shoaib has been cautioned his recovery period could be longer. Doctors have said he is out for three weeks, but it could be longer, PCB spokesman Samiul Hasan said.  Shoaib, however, put on a smiling face on Monday,  saying his contribution to Pakistans possible win in the  first Test was achieved with his four-wicket burst. I am  happy that I have contributed to the teams position, whether  Mohammed Sami takes more wickets or Danish Kaneria takes  the bulk, I want my contribution in the win, said Shoaib.

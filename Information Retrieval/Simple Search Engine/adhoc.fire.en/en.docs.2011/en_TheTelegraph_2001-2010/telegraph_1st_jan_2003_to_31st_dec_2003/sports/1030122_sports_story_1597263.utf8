The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 A breather for Lanka
																								Colombo: The Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) has asked for more time from the ICC, awaiting the return of skipper Sanath Jayasuriya from Australia, to resolve the pay row that threatens the countrys participation in the World Cup.																								[According to a top ICC source late Tuesday, the BCCSL has been given a breather till Friday. Thats when our Executive Board will confer telephonically on both the Lankan and Indian issues, he told The Telegraph, adds our Special Correspondent.]																								The BCCSL said it has asked for a few more days to get its squad to sign the Player Terms after another round of talks with Jayasuriya failed. The BCCSL believes it will be able to negotiate directly with Sanath when he returns Wednesday, a BCCSL spokesman said. 																								Meanwhile, the state-run Daily News slammed Jayasuriya and his men. We admire the determination they have shown in negotiating for money, but we wish they had shown those qualities when facing the likes of Glenn McGrath. (PTI)

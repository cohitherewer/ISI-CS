 Pollock fined full match fees for dissent
 Pollock is the ninth player to be fined or suspended this year Rawalpindi: Match Referee Clive Lloyd fined South African allrounder Shaun Pollock his full match fees on Wednesday for dissent in Tuesdays third one-dayer against Pakistan. Umpire Darrell Hair reported Pollock for showing dissent and after taking into account evidence he was charged under level 2 clause of the Code of Conduct and has been fined his full match fees, Lloyd said. However, the Match Referee found no evidence that wicketkeeper Mark Boucher used abusive language against Pakistani allrounder Shoaib Malik. A PCB spokesman added that Lloyd had heard the charges and had exonerated Boucher. The Match Referee has also cautioned the Pakistan and South African teams over slow over-rates, Samiul Hasan said. He said Lloyd had not fined Pakistan for slow over-rates in the third one-dayer because the match finished early due to bad light. But the slow over-rate remains a major concern and teams can run into serious trouble, Lloyd said. Shaun Pollock is the ninth player to be fined or suspended this year for violating the code of conduct. (Reuters)  Copyright

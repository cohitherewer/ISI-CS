 Defeat dents TFA White chances
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: Uzbekistan moved into the final of the JRD Tata Cup international invitational football tournament when they outplayed India TFA White 2-0 in a league tie on Friday. Both Uzbekistan and India TFA White have completed their engagements with eight and seven points, respectively. TFA White still has a chance of making the title-round if India TFA Blue manages to beat Iran on Saturday, or at least play out a draw. Iran have five points from three matches while TFA Blue have three from as many. If Iran win, they will slip into the final versus the Uzbeks on Monday. The days match was marked by some drama as TFA Whites star playmaker Malswama was given marching orders by Thai referee Natth Phaengsupha within seven minutes of the start. Uzbekistans Abdumajid Yulchiev was also shown the red card. Both players were penalised for rough tackle. The first goal came in the 29th minute when Abbos Abdullayev slotted in a cross from Anzur Ismailov. The team slid in the second in the 74th minute through Shakhboz Umarov.  Copyright

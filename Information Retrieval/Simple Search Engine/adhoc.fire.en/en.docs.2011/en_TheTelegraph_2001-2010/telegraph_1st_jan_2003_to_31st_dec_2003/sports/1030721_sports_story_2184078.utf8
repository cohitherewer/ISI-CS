 MacGill out of Warne shadow

He took five for 65 in the Bangladesh second innings (AFP) Darwin: Stuart MacGill, living in the shadow of Shane Warne, has learnt to take his opportunities when they arise and on Sunday he did it again with his seventh five-wicket haul in Test cricket. The leg-spinner snared five for 65 as Bangladesh lost the first Test here by an innings and 132 runs midway through the third days play at Marrara Oval. MacGill now has the 121 wickets in 24 Tests, five wickets a Test, remarkable considering that he is regarded as the understudy to Australias greatest wicket-taker Shane Warne, who is currently sitting out a 12-month drugs ban. Warne has amassed 491 wickets in 107 Tests at slightly less than the wicket-taking ability of the New South Wales tweaker. Ive learned through my career that when you get a chance with the ball you have to make the most of it, so Im really quite satisfied with how it went today. The leg-spinner added Bangladesh didnt die wondering on Sunday and he was taken for two sixes by Al Sahariar and Mashrafe Mortaza in the second innings. That last six I got hit for (by Mortaza) was definitely one of the biggest sixes off my bowling, he said. Normally 90 per cent of my wickets come from my leg-break and even in the first innings I got both my wickets with something different. In this game I felt if I was consistent with my leg-break perhaps the variation was a chance and it was. Ive been playing for Nottinghamshire in the English County championship and we play on really slow wickets and I think its improving my bowling because the margin for error is much smaller over there and I have to work a little bit more on my consistency.

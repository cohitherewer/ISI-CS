 Humpy leads with a round to go
Kozhikode: Top seed GM Koneru Humpy maintained her lead, moving to 6.5 points, after the eighth and penultimate round in the Asian womens chess championship on Sunday. Half-a-point behind Humpy, in second spot, were five players  Hoang Tanh Trang and Li Kieu Kim of Vietnam, Indians D. Harika and S. Vijayalakshmi and Xu Yuanyuan of China. On the top board, Humpy played a Nimzo-Indian Defence and opened up a slight advantage by the 11th move to make room for her major pieces, pushing Trang on the defensive. Humpy committed a major blunder on the 26th move, but recovered and drew level by the 30th to ensure a draw in 35 moves. After an English Opening, tournament sensation Harika made a positional error on her 12th move against Le Kieu Kim, but bounced back by the 17th to ensure a draw after 20 moves. On the third board, WGM Vijayalakshmi opted for the Morphy variation against the Ruy Lopez Opening of Zhang Jilin and went for a rook exchange on the 24th move. Though the Chennai player was ahead by the 30th move, Zhang neutralised soon to split the point after 57 moves. In an all-Chinese affair, Xu Yuanyuan beat second seed Zhao Xue on the fourth board.

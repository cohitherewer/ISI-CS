 Autopsy report surprises doctor 
Paris: France team doctor Jean-Marcel Ferret has expressed surprise that Cameroon midfielder Marc-Vivien Foes death was caused by a heart-related condition. Foe passed a thorough medical examination when he joined Olympique Lyon in 2000, Ferret said in the French daily Le Parisien Wednesday. He was declared absolutely fit to play soccer. He was not suffering from any heart malformation, he added. The autopsy on Foe found that he died from a hypertrophic cardio myopathy. (Reuters)  Copyright

		 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 Anand draws with Timman
				 	 ANAND: Draw in 23 moves																								Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): Viswanathan Anand did not require even a single original move to get to a comfortable draw with veteran Dutch Grandmaster Jan Timman while Judit Polgar shot into sole lead after a thumping victory against Anatoly Karpov in the fourth round of Corus chess meet here.																								Worlds best woman player Judit Polgar of Hungary gave an amazing display of her attacking prowess against the former Russian world champion to take the sole lead on 3 points.																								Russian duo of BrainGames match winner Vladimir Kramnik and Evegeny Bareev, Spaniard Alexei Shirov and Anand remained on the heels of the leader half a point behind while as many as five players including Karpov were tied with a fifty percent score at fifth place.																								In the Grandmaster group B tournament, former world junior girls champion Koneru Humpy drew with women world championship finalist Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia to take her tally to 1.5 from four games. 																								Top seed GM Zhang Zhong of China continued with his winning run in the event and registered his third victory on the trot to maintain a slender half point lead over nearest rivals. Humpy is on joint 8th position with 9 more rounds remaining. 																								It turned out to be a friendly theoretical discussion between Timman and Anand. The draw was agreed to in just 23 moves. 																								Polgar, the lone woman in the main event, continued to hold centre stage. The victory for Polgar was sweet and well timed considering that beating Karpov is no joke. 																								Karpov was up against a queens Indian defence. Embarking on the Petrosian system, the Russian faced a theoretical novelty by Polgar on the 12th move and got into trouble after missing a picturesque tactical stroke on the 16th move that left his king stranded in the centre.																								It took 33 moves for Polgar to add Karpovs scalp to her kitty.																								Kramnik registered a study-like win over polish GM Michal Krasenkow. (PTI)

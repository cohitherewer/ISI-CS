 Argentine replaces Hierro 
Madrid: Real Madrid are set to sign Argentina international Gabriel Milito from Independiente to shore up their weakness in central defence. Real Madrid failed to defend their Champions League crown last season and poor defence, particularly the centre-backs, was the reason given by most pundits. Milito will fill the gap left by Reals long-serving captain and centre-back Fernando Hierro, who was unceremoniously sacked along with coach Vicente del Bosque last month.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

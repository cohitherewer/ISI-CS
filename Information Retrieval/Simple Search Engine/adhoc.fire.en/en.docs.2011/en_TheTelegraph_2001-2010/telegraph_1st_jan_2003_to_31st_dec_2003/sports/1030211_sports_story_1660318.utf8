The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tollygunge desperate for win 
  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Ashim: To play as withdrawn forward Calcutta: Tollygunge Agragami have had a mixed bag this season, but nothing short of a victory will satisfy them in their National Football League (NFL) match against Indian Bank at the Salt Lake Stadium Tuesday. Aloke Mukherjee put things in perspective. It is important that we do not lose any points against teams placed below us at home, the coach said. Tollygunge have 14 points from 12 games while Indian Bank have 12 from 11. Mukherjee, though, wasnt willing to under-estimate the bankmen. They are quite an organised side. I have asked the boys to keep (Nadika) Jayasuriya under double covering and keep an eye on Sabbir Pasha as well. Tollygunges recent record against Indian Bank has hardly been encouraging. The city team lost both times they met the Chennai outfit  in the first phase of the NFL in Chennai and then in the IFA Shield. On both occasions, we were in control and should have won, the coach observed. On the likely composition of his team, the coach said: We will play in the 4-5-1 formation which yielded great results against Salgaocar. Tollygunge held Salgaocar 1-1 in their last match. Mukherjee said he wants to use his lynchpin, Ashim Biswas, as a withdrawal forward. I want to use his playmaking qualities to the full along with Moses Owira. Nigerian Akeem Abolanle will be the lone striker. Salgaocar eye victory Salgaocar will try to extend their impressive run when they take on Vasco at the Nehru Stadium Tuesday, PTI adds from Margao. Three wins and a draw in the last four matches have put the former champions on 23 points, seven adrift of leaders East Bengal. Salgacoar coach Savio Madiera feels his team will perform to potential. Theres also an added motivation, as Salgaocar lost their first leg match to Vasco. Vasco coach Derick Pereira said: With Rui Wanderly Weis not at his best, I plan to field newcomer Luis Antonio. Vasco have a point less than Salgaocar.  Copyright

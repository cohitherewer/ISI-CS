The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No Becks tag please
London, June 21 (AFP): James Anderson, dubbed the David Beckham of English cricket, said he had no wish to be as famous as the Real Madrid-bound football star. Anderson, 20, produced a match-winning performance which would have made the England football captain proud, becoming the first England bowler to take a ODI hattrick. The Lancashire paceman said Beckham-style fame was not for him. Im not sure Id like as much pressure and attention as David Beckham gets. This is cricket and I dont think its followed as much as football, added Anderson. But if kids want to play cricket because of me then I am happy with that. Reflecting on his bowling, Anderson said: The ball is coming out well at the moment. I was just trying to hit the stumps, especially with the No. 10 and 11. I tried to pitch all three balls as full as possible, explained Anderson, who had Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami as his hattrick victims. It gave me goose bumps when I ran into bowl my hattrick ball. Everything went crazy when it came off, added Anderson. Some experienced bowlers have told me theyve never had one (a hattrick) and now Ive got two in a season (against Essex with England Test captain Nasser Hussain one of the victims).  Copyright

				 																																																	 Even as Mohun Bagans four Punjab recruits threatened to return home because they had not received any payment from the club, the High Court-appointed special officers scrambled to arrange for the money, and said on Tuesday that they hoped to start paying the players by Wednesday.				 																																																	The sponsors might seek our signatures on the requisition and that could delay the process. We have informed them that if needed we will sign, Justice G.N. Ray, one of the special officers, said.				 																																																	He added that they were negotiating with the sponsors, UB Group, over additional funds needed to sign Jose Ramirez Barreto. The signing of players would also be completed by Saturday. 				 																																																	Meanwhile, the warring factions came together at an informal meeting in a bid to restore normalcy at the club. Both parties decided to keep the players away from club politics. However, the fighting spirit among the rival factions persisted and initially there was hardly any sensible talk possible.				 																																																	The issue was of ego, with nobody able to decide who was going to moderate the debate. Sense prevailed later and a hasty desicion was taken to save the day as the players relented too.

In the cadet girls final, Priya Saha takes on Madhurima Das.

 BCCI neglects former players: Mushtaq
 - Legendary batsman feels Sachin  is the Kohinoor of cricket Mushtaq doesnt  think a foreign coach is necessary  Indore: Legendary cricketer  Mushtaq Ali accused the Board of Control for Cricket in  India (BCCI) of showing an utter disregard towards players  of his era and said it was high time cricket administrators  made a serious effort to ameliorate the plight of these  former players. The BCCI should think about honouring  the players who brought glory to Indian cricket. They dont  bother about us and its quite a shame, Mushtaq said. Still perfectly fit at 89, Mushtaq  said he has never believed in begging for favours from the  BCCI but felt it was the duty of the administrators to be  a little more sympathetic. We were paid only Rs 250 per  Test, and there were very few benefit matches at that time,  said Mushtaq, who represented India in 11 Tests and scored  612 runs at 32.21, including two centuries. I will have to undergo a cataract  surgery in a few months from now and it would help if the  BCCI takes care of such expenses, he said, while insisting  that his sons were in financially sound position to meet  the expenses. He also did not appear very happy  with the modern-day version of cricket. W. G. Grace agar aaj ka cricket  dekhte to bechaare ro dete, Mushtaq said. In those days cricket was so  tradition-bound that it was seemingly difficult to imagine  any change could take place. We didnt believe that a time  would come when something called one-day cricket would dominate  the game completely, he said. Mushtaq also has strong reservations  about the current dress code in one-day cricket. The kind  of (coloured) clothes they don in one-day cricket, they  look like jokers, he said.  But describing Sachin Tendulkar  as the Kohinoor, he said the maestros technical skill  and strokeplay has made modern-day cricket worth watching. The original Kohinoor may be  resting in England but we have our own  Sachin Tendulkar,  he said. Sunil Gavaskar got the chance  to face better quality bowlers (from West Indies) during  his time. But Sachin has never played them. I would have  loved to see him play against such great fast bowlers,  he said.  But he opined there was no need  to change the Ranji Trophy format. The idea of appointing a foreign  coach was also beyond my comprehension since there are  so many talented coaches in the country. He cited the example  of Sandeep Patil who worked wonders with minnows Kenya  during the last World Cup. (PTI) Copyright

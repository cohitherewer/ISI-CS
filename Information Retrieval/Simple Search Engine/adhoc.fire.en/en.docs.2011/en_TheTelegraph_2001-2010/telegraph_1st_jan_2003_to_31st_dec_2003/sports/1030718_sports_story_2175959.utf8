 Gus Logie wants to build on recent success
 Logie (seen with captain Lara) is excited to get the extension St Johns: Augustine Gus Logie was appointed senior team coach of the West Indies on Wednesday after serving in a caretaker capacity in the recent series against Australia and Sri Lanka. Logie, who played 52 Tests and 158 ODIs, signed a two-year contract (as reported in Thursdays late edition). The 42-year-old said he was excited by the appointment. Logie was serving temporarily as a replacement for Roger Harper, who has taken over as head coach at the cricket academy of the St Georges University in Grenada. The decision to offer Logie an extension was taken at the WICBs meeting of directors in Roseau, Dominica, over the weekend. I am excited about being appointed coach of the senior West Indies team. Its another opportunity to serve West Indies cricket at another level, said Logie, who was an entertaining middle-order batsman and fine fielder. Logie declared he was looking to build on the encouraging home series against Australia and Sri Lanka. They rebounded in the final Test against the Aussies, having already lost the first three, to register the highest successful fourth-innings chase in Test history. Later they beat Sri Lanka 1-0 in a two-Test series. We started something with this team in Guyana against the Australians, which has worked for us, and we will be looking to continue in this vein, he said. We want to show the players that commitment and personal responsibility, along with the right attitude, discipline and hard work can help one improve as an individual. And as a team in world cricket. Logie played his Test match cricket between 1983 and 1991, scoring 2470 runs at an average of 35.79.  (AFP)  Copyright

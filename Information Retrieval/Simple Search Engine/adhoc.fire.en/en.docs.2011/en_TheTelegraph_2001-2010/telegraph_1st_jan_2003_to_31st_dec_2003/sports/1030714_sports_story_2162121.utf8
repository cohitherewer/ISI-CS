The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thrilling win for India A
London: A 38-run unfinished last-wicket partnership between Irfan Pathan and Avishkar Salvi helped India A clinch a one-wicket victory against Lancashire in Blackpool Sunday. Pathan had earlier put on 22 for the ninth wicket with L. Balaji . Chasing 192 for victory, India A were reduced to 155 for nine, Pakistan allrounder Azhar Mahmood taking three for 28. For India A, Vijay Bharadwaj was the highest scorer, as they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Bengal captain Rohan Gavaskar managed three. Earlier, Pathan (four for 19) and Salvi (three for 38) were instrumental in restricting Lancashire to 191. Balaji (three for 37) also did a commendable job. C. Schofield (69 n.o.) and G. Maiden (62) were the top scorers for Lancashire. At one stage, the hosts were reduced to 61 for eight, but a 130-run ninth wicket partnership between Schofield and Maiden helped them reach a fighting total. Mahmood (0) was claimed by Pathan.

 Ronaldo wants Olympic gold
Rio de Janeiro, Dec. 27 (AFP): Real Madrids Brazilian superstar Ronaldo has admitted his New Year wont be complete without having the chance to win the Olympic gold medal in Athens next summer. Ronaldo, who capped a fine World Cup last year by scoring twice in the final against Germany, said he wants to make himself available for selection to Olympic team coach Ricardo Gomes. Im going to be a fan while waiting for the pre-Olympic team to win its ticket (in the qualifying tournament). Then I would like to make myself available for selection to Gomes for the Olympic Games, Ronaldo said in an interview. The 27-year-old strikers interest is understandable given his contribution to Brazils two World Cup triumphs in the past decade (1994, 2002). However, it seems mainly to stem from the unfinished business of Atlanta in 1996  when Brazil could only manage the bronze medal. Only three players over the age of 23 are allowed to take part in Olympic football teams, and two other Brazilians  Real Madrids Roberto Carlos and AC Milan midfielder Kaka  have also expressed Athens Olympics aspirations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mixed day for Bangla
Chittagong: Bangladeshs top order collapsed in familiar fashion on Thursday, leaving them tottering at 93 for four in their first innings on the second day of the final Test against England. That left them 233 runs behind England, who suffered a collapse of their own earlier in the day losing their last five wickets for 13 to be bowled out for 326. England medium-pacer Rikki Clarke, playing only his second match, grabbed two wickets off successive balls to reduce Bangladesh from 61 for two to 63 for four after opener Javed Omar (2) and Hahibul Bashar (18) had fallen early. The 22-year-old Clarke trapped Hannan Sarkar (28) leg-before, shuffling across his stumps, off the last ball of his fourth over and then got Alok Kapali, fending a bouncer to gully, off the first ball of his fifth. England had earlier slumped from 313 for five as Chris Read (37), Nasser Hussain (76), Richard Johnson (6), Martin Saggers (1) and Ashley Giles (6) fell within 13 overs. Paceman Mashrafe Mortaza claimed a career-best four for 60. But the visitors still ended the day in command because of Bangladeshs failure to come to terms with a pitch that offered seamers Hoggard, Clarke, Johnson and debutant Saggers some bounce and lateral movement. England started the day on 237 for four, but lost Clarke in the days fourth over. Hussain raised his 29th Test 50 and consolidated with Read to take England past the 300-run mark, their first time against Bangladesh in two Tests. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Rivaldo keen on Chelsea switch 
 Milan not too keen to leave Rivaldo London: While Brazilian World Cup winner Rivaldo eyes a move to big-spending English club Chelsea, his present employers AC Milan dont seem too keen to leave the playmaker. Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani says the club has had a change of heart and wants to keep Brazilian playmaker. Milan announced on Friday that they had agreed to the players request to be released from his contract. The former Barcelona striker said he wanted to leave Milan as he could no longer cope with being left out of the side by coach Carlo Ancelotti. But after the Brazilian said farewell to his teammates before the 3-0 win over Lecce on Sunday, Galliani said he would make an attempt to keep Rivaldo. The documents relating to the cancellation of Rivaldos contract are still in the office drawer. I will do everything in the coming hours to keep Riva, Galliani told the clubs television station Milan Channel. It is my desire and that of the team and Ancelotti would be very glad to have him back, added Galliani. However, Rivaldo maintained he is keen on a Chelsea switch and its unlikely hell stay on in Milan. Tomorrow I will talk with Galliani but I think it will be difficult, said the Brazilian. It is sad, today the fans were chanting my name, but life is like that, he added. Rivaldo repeated that his main problem was his lack of opportunities in the side. The situation is very difficult, I have not had a chance to play and I have always played at other clubs.  At Chelsea it would be very easy for me to fit in quickly because there are already so many stars, some of whom I know directly. Perhaps that would make it the easiest choice for me because if I have good partners who know how I play then I could, literally, guarantee success. So Chelsea is interesting to me but I cannot say more specifically at the moment. I have to take in other factors. However, I think that England is the logical destination for me because Ive had so many offers from there that it would be the easiest place to go and succeed. Rivaldo revealed that Middlesbrough and Newcastle are two of the clubs chasing his signature but he has reservations about joining either of the north-east outfits. At Newcastle of course I know there is interest, but I know that Sir Bobby Robson could be having trouble so Ill wait on that. (agencies)  Copyright

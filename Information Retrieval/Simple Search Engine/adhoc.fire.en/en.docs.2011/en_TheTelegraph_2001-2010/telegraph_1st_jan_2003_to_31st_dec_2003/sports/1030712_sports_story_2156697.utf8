The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Swayams is sole leader
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT Bhubaneswar: Swayams Mishra of Cuttacks Stewart School emerged sole leader with 6.5 points after the end of the seventh round of the Bhubaneswar leg of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship here. In the seventh round, he drew with Sourav Mohapatra of Cambridge School, Cuttack with white pieces in a Ruy Lopez, Classical variation. Neither of them could gain any advantage of the opening. White had some space advantage in the middle game but black successfully managed to keep the position closed making it difficult for white to make a breakthrough. Both players agreed to a draw after 61 moves. Earlier in the sixth round, Swayams faced top seed Kiran Manisha Mohanty of Aurovindo School of BBSR. Kiran started the game with her favourite e4 and Swayams replied with e5 and the game turned into Ruy Lopez Worrel Attack variation. Kiran had a good position in the middle game but because of a series of weak moves her position slowly crumbled. She played a wrong move in the 41st and had to resign on the 70th. In the second board of the seventh round, Sumit Kumar Banerjee of Damodarpur UGME School faced Kiran. Manisha adopted the Sicilian defence. Sumit committed a mistake by castling on the queen side and lost a pawn on e5. Afterwards he lost a knight because of a blunder and was mated on the 49th move. In the third board, Debasish Das of Niali High School adopted the Petroffs defence against Thompson Sahoo of Govt Boys High School, IRC Village, BBSR and got an equal position in the middle game.

 Vancouver win bid 
Prague: Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics on Wednesday after a secret vote by International Olympic Committee members. The Canadians beat off bids from South Koreas Pyeongchang and the Austrian city of Salzburg to win the right to stage the winter sports extravaganza after two rounds of voting. Salzburg was eliminated after placing last of the three candidates in the first round. Vancouver beat Pyeongchang in the second ballot.Vancouvers Sea to Sky bid had been praised early on by the IOCs evaluation commission for its clear vision for the Olympics that would leave a good post-Games legacy. The early favourite, Vancouver stayed in front throughout to bring the Games to Canada for the first time since the 1988 Calgary Olympics. However, the Salzburg delegation reacted with disappointment to their surprise elimination. Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel said: We are deeply disappointed. Theres no point blaming the referee...it was a sporting competition and we lost in the first round and that hurts, he said. We knew we werent the favourite and that Vancouver was a nose ahead of us. But we expected an open, exciting race to the end and thats why this early exit hurts. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Real scotch Beckham rumours
Madrid: Real Madrid have tried to quash rumours about a possible deal to sign England captain David Beckham by issuing a formal statement denying any interest in buying the Manchester United player. Contrary to the speculation that has surrounded this matter, Real Madrid have no intention of negotiating a deal to sign Mr. Beckham, read the statement put out on the clubs website on Tuesday. Although the club has a policy of not using official channels to deny rumours, the present statement has been issued in order to bring an end to the growing speculation that, without any basis, has linked Mr. Beckham to Real Madrid.

				 																																	Johannesburg: Allan Donald came under renewed fire on Tuesday when former South Africa allrounder Adrian Kuiper criticised his bowling at the World Cup and suggested he should not be selected again.				 																																	Kuiper, one of the veteran fast bowlers former teammates, said: The bowling attack hasnt gelled and Allan Donald hasnt been a real threat, has he? I think it could be the end of the road for Donald, he told The Citizen newspaper.				 																																	There comes a time in everyones career. He isnt bowling with confidence and is only at half pace.				 																																	Donald, due to retire after the tournament, has taken one wicket for 106 runs in two Group B matches. South Africa already need other results to go their way if they are to reach the second round.				 																																	Donald played in the defeats by West Indies and New Zealand but was not selected for the easy victory over Kenya. Why didnt we play Allan against Kenya? If he was lacking form he should have played, Kuiper added.				 																																	Donald had been heavily criticised in the media and by his own supporters during the tournament. The 36-year-old, who was nicknamed White Lightning, is the only South African to take 300 Test wickets, and has 272 one-day victims.				 																																	Cricket bible Wisden named Donald as their second-best one-day bowler of all time behind Pakistans Wasim Akram. Kuiper played one Test and 25 one-dayers, the last in January 1996. 				 																																	Johannesburg: South Africas struggling World Cup squad should go on a drinking binge in a bid to get their campaign back on track, according to one of the countrys leading newspapers.				 																																	Beer  its the fuel of all champion teams, the Johannesburg-based Star suggested Tuesday. It added that Shaun Pollocks side should do what the rest of the country did on Sunday night and get hammered on beer and wine and leave the regrets in the bottom of the bottle.				 																																	South Africa, the pre-tournament second favourites behind Australia, lost two of their first three games and need other results to go their way if they are to sneak through to the second round from Group B.				 																																	It said Australia had come back from a similarly poor start in 1999 to win the trophy, before repeating its suggested solution for bringing the home side success.				 																																	Ranchi: Indian womens cricket skipper Anjum Chopra Tuesday said the mens team would benefit if the captain batted down the order and gave Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag a chance to go at the bowling with their natural striking power.				 																																	I feel Sourav can be pushed down the order as in the past two games he has not done well... Even in New Zealand he has not been scoring when coming up the order, Anjum, the only Indian woman to have an ODI century said.				 																																	She said Sachin and Virender can open the innings and Sourav can come down at No. 3. 				 																																	She also appealed to the people not to attack the houses of the cricketers.				 																																	After all it is just a game of cricket and one should not attach so much emotional importance, she said, condemning the attack at the residence of Mohammed Kaif in Allahabad. 				 																																	Its very sad. Whoever did that, is not right. It is really unfair. I heard that Kaifs mother had been mistreated by some people. They threw stones at her house. She is an old woman. The culprits should be punished, said Anjum.				 																																	Nairobi: Kenyan coach Sandeep Patil has said he was disappointed New Zealand refused to play their match in Kenya despite Nairobis security guarantee.				 																																	Its sad that New Zealand cannot come here. The Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) and the government have worked hard to make sure their grievances were addressed, Patil said.				 																																	We have tried our best, but I cant talk about their judgement. I respect their judgement, Patil, a former Indian Test star said.				 																																	Patil, fresh from his teams four-wicket win over Canada at the weekend, said he will take one game at a time. 				 																																	He sounded extremely respectful about Sri Lanka, whom Kenya play on February 24. 				 																																	We have to stay focused and positive, but we have to realise also that it (Lanka) is a giant team, Patil added. 				 																																	n India vs Zimbabwe Live from 1 pm on Max and DD-1 n England vs Namibia from 1:30 pm on Sony n Canada vs Sri Lanka, deferred live from 11:30 pm on Max

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Laras day out on karting track 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: For the sponsors it was more of an occasion to showcase Brian Lara and the crowd lapped it up with vigour. The city-leg of the MRF-MAI Formulae Mondilae championships was reduced to the background as the West Indies skipper hogged all the limelight during his hour-long stay at the go-karting track in the outskirts of the city on Sunday evening. I like the crowd here Calcutta is one of my favourite cities in India, Laras comments sent the spectators into raptures. Going by popular demand, Lara also made a couple of rounds of the 3.5km track on the kart. He started off at a slow pace and even hit the side barrier once, but he soon gained in confidence, picked up speed and finished with aplomb. I never felt tense. I had the experience of go-karting once in the past and not an entirely new experience for me, he said. I plan to get more involved with go-karting once I quit cricket, he said after watching keenly the KCT final, the first of the three events slated for the day. Goas Audember Hede won the 22-lap race with a timing of 9:59.131. City boy Amitrajit Ghosh (10:05.698) came second followed by Amar Patil (10:09.352) from Pune. Having handed over the prizes, Lara also joined in the celebrations, forcing a not-too-eager Hede open his bottle of champagne on the victory podium. Punes Raymond Banerjee won the showpiece event, the INKC final. Banglaore-based Deepak Pal Chinappa was second and Fazal Khan third. Last years Asian zone champion Preetham Muniappa was fourth.

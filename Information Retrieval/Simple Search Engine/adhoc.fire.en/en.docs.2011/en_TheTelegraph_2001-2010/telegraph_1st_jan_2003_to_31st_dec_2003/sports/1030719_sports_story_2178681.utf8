 Kallis may skip game for dad
London: South African allrounder Jacques Kallis is staying home with his critically ill father, meaning he could miss the first Test against England which starts next Thursday at Edgbaston. Kallis scored 329 runs in the tri-series before flying home to be with father Henry who has lung cancer. We appreciate that this is an extremely difficult and emotional time for Jacques, said South African coach Eric Simons in a statement Thursday. I have told him that he must take as much time as he needs to be with his father, Simons said. Shaun Pollock, however, will be back in time for the tourists next match  a three-day game against India A starting in Arundel Saturday  after spending time with his wife, who is pregnant. Pollock is expected to miss the fourth Test of the series in order to be at the birth. (AFP)  Copyright

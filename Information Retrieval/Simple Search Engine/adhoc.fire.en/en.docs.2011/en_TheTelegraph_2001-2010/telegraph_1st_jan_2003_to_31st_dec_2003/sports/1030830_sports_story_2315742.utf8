 CA sees strong Warne return
Sydney: Cricket Australia on Friday said it was looking forward to the return of a strong Shane Warne to international cricket once his ban expires next year. We are looking forward to February 10 next year and Warne coming back as a strong player, CA chairman Bob Merriman told The Herald Sun. Merriman insisted the players personal life was not a matter of concern for the board. (PTI)  Copyright

 Pak hail Indias return to top tier
Karachi, Aug. 9 (AFP): Pakistan coach Tahir Zaman on Saturday called on Asian teams to play aggressively to counter the Europeans. He also welcomed Indias return to the top flight, before leaving for Amstelveen, Holland, for the Champions Trophy beginning on Saturday. Pakistan and India are the representatives of Asia in the elite six-team event. The neighbours, once considered giants of international hockey with 11 Olympic titles and five world titles between them, find themselves out of the top three and are engaged in a quest to regain lost glory. Its heartening that India is coming up after being out of the top-six fold but they too have brought in aggression in their style, said Zaman, a member of Pakistans 1994 World Cup champion side. Field hockeys attraction is the flair and skill of Asians but since the face of the sport has changed, Asian teams need to be aggressive to counter the Europeans, Zaman said.  Copyright

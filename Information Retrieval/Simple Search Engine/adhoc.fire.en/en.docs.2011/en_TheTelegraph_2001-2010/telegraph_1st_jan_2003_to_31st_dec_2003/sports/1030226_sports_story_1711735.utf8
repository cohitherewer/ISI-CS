The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gower hopes England are 3rd time lucky
			 London: Former England skipper David Gower was hoping that his country would be third time lucky against India when the two square up in a crunch World Cup match in Durban Wednesday. India beat England in the last two big games  the NatWest series final last summer and the ICC Trophy clash last September  but Gower hoped England would go out and score a win Wednesday . Cricketers always used to be superstitious folk. I would always look to find the same shirt, trousers, gloves and, naturally enough, bat if I was in the middle of a good run and would imagine a Hussain, Trescothick or Knight might do the same. So maybe the simple analysis of third time lucky might be enough, Gower wrote in a column. For both Nasser Hussain and Ganguly it is time for another stirring up and at em dressing-room speech, a sort of once more unto the breach or its no Super Sixes for us.  (PTI)  Copyright

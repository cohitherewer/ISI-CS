 Frank Bruno in mental hospital
London: Former world heavyweight boxing champion Frank Bruno was being treated at a mental hospital after being taken from his home by medics. A police source said officers had helped to remove the 41-year-old father of three from his home in Essex on Tuesday under the terms of mental health legislation. Essex police said: We have been assisting ambulance crews to remove a patient from an address near Brentwood. The source added: The patient is Frank Bruno. It is my understanding that he has been sectioned. He said Bruno was believed to have been taken to a London hospital. Bruno has recently gone through a painful and costly divorce from wife Laura. The Briton admitted last month he had received treatment at the Priory Clinic, known for treating addiction, following his divorce. However, he denied he had a drink or drugs problem.

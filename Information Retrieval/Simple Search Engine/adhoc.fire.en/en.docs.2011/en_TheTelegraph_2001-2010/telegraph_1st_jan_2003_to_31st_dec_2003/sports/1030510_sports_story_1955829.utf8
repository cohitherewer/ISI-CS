 Ramesh: We lost on Day III 
New Delhi: The third day turned out to be the decisive phase of the Ranji Trophy final, Tamil Nadu opening batsman and former India player Sadagopan Ramesh said on Friday. I think we lost the match on the third day when we were bowled out for 271. We were aiming for a first innings lead of 100-150 runs but lost the last six wickets cheaply (for 43 runs), Ramesh said over phone from Chennai. After skittling out hosts Mumbai for a modest 260, Tamil Nadu managed to extract only a paltry 11-run first innings lead. Mumbai went on to make 387 in the second innings before bowling out Tamil Nadu for 235 to clinch a 141-run victory and their 35th title. Ramesh also said some bad bowling and a few dropped catches completed a miserable day. We did not bowl well at the start of second innings (of Mumbai) and also a dropped a few catches. It was a bad day overall for us, he said. Our plan was to get a big first innings lead while also batting Mumbai out of the match. We never thought about batting in the second innings on that wicket, he said. Ramesh said Tamil Nadu did well throughout the season and had their own moments in the final before things went wrong.

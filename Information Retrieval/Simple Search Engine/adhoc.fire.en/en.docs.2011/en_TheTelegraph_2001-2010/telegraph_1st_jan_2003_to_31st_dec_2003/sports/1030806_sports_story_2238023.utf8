The Telegraph - Calcutta
 First Test in Ahmedabad
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The first Test between India and New Zealand, scheduled to be held in Kanpur from October 8-12, has been shifted to Ahmedabad. The second and final Test stays at Mohali. Announcing this on Tuesday, the BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said that according to members of the Grounds and Wickets Committee, the Green Park ground in Kanpur is in no shape to host an international match. Members of the Grounds and Wickets Committee visited Kanpur on Monday and after meeting Dalmiya here, reported that there is a tussle between the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) and the state government, hindering proper maintenance of the ground.  Kanpur faces embargo The four members of the committee  chairman Venkat Sundaram, Daljit Singh, Prabir Mukherjee and Anand Shukla (Dhiraj Parsana, the fifth member, is abroad)  even recommended that Kanpur shouldnt be allotted international matches until the dispute is settled. Dalmiya said the BCCI will consider the suggestion and take a decision after its working committee meeting in Chennai on August 20 and 21. The BCCI chief added practically no work had been done at the Kanpur ground for nearly six months and though some did get underway recently, it is going at a snails pace. The last international match played in Kanpur was an ODI between India and England in January 2002.  Copyright

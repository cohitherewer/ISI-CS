The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We have the technique to handle such wkts: Fleming
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Ahmedabad: Adjusting to the conditions in India has been Stephen Flemings sides biggest challenge on this tour. From the bouncy tracks back home to the slow and low turners here has been quite a task and on Tuesday the New Zealand skipper claimed his side has the technique to handle it. Youve got to make some adjustments. Its vastly different from what we play on but theres no need for tension. If the pitch does turn, my team has the technique to handle such situations. Were not going to worry too much about it, Fleming remarked. He predicts it will be a tough battle for the Indian spinners to make the visitors lie low as the pressure will be on the hosts. The expectations from the Indians will certainly be high. There will be a good turnout, a demanding public and a demanding media. Everyone will expect India to do well and win the series. In Fleming, the Black Caps possess an astute leader who has guided the team to considerable success in their recent sojourns to the subcontinent. He led the way with an epic unbeaten 274 against Sri Lanka in Colombo during the last drawn series. And the Indians will have to look to dismiss him early. I always look to perform in these conditions, he stressed. But we also have other good players who can perform in these conditions Nathan Astle, the gutsy Mark Richardson, Craig McMillan weve enough talent to deliver the goods. Sourav Ganguly, however, felt that expectations cannot weigh his team down. Expectations are always there. Its how you handle this pressure. We are confident after our performance at home in the last three years.  Copyright

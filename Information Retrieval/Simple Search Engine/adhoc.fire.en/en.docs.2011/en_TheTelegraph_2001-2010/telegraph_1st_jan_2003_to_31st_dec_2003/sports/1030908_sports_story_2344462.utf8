 Jugraj is fully out of danger
Ludhiana: Injured hockey star Jugraj Singh is on the path to recovery and completely out of danger, but doctors were still not sure when the penalty corner expert would be able to take the field again. Doctors and experts are keeping fingers crossed and not even willing to suggest a tentative timeframe for the 20-year-olds return to the national squad. His haemoglobin level is normal and he is responding well to the treatment, said one of the doctors attending on Jugraj. According to Dr Bassi, chief of the orthopaedic department of the DMC Hospital where Jugraj is admitted, said Jugraj was in high spirits. He added that Jugrajs right elbow, which had multiple fractures, had been properly screwed while a bone had also been put in position. According to another medical opinion, progress in such cases depends on physiotheraphy and will-power of the patient. Jugraj is lucky to have not injured his hip bone, otherwise the case would have been all the more complicated. Jugraj, who has been Indias penalty corner specialist for the last few tournaments, was at his best against Pakistan in the recently concluded Champions Trophy which India won 7-4. He scored two and foiled Pakistans penalty corner specialist Shohail Abbas a number of times, even taking hits on his body. Jugraj had the accident on the Grand Truck Road in Jalandhar late last Tuesday when his car hit a lamp post, trying to avoid an auto-rickshaw. (PTI)  Copyright

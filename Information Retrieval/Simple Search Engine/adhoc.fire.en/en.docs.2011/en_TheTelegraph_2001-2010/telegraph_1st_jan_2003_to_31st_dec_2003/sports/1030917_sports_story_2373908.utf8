The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, September 17, 2003  Its Aretino vs Richie Rich 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: It may turn out to be a close contest between Aretino and Richie Rich in the 2,000m Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes, the main attraction in Wednesdays race card. The former, a Vijay Singh-trainee, has had adequate preparations for the Derby in Bangalore. However, the No Louder-Lady Cox three-year-old may find a strong challenger in Richie Rich, the comfortable winner of the Colts Stakes last month. However, with a victory on the uphill Bangalore racetrack under his belt, Aretino, who will be ridden by C. Alford, gets preference over Richie Rich.

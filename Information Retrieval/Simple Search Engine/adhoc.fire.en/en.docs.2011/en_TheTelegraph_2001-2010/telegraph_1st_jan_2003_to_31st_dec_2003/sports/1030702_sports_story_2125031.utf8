The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, July 02, 2003  Gullane may be hard to beat 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Mysore: Gullane appears to be a safe bet in the upper division of the 1,400m Hyderabad Race Club Gold Trophy on Wednesday here. In his previous start, he had placed a good second behind a form-horse like Marvel Star. Gullane, a ward of Z. Darashah, had set record time over the course almost two years ago. Now crossing swords with his vanquisher at favourable terms, K. P. Appu is unlikely to miss this time out.				 										The Lower division may see Potential Force coming good. The Satish Narredu-trainee will be partnered by Suraj Narredu.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2 pm: Auric 1. Aethion 2. Random Hearts 3.				 										2.30 pm: Sheer Blossoms 1.

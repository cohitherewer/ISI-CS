The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dashing Chief may upstage stablemate 
 BY STAR RACER  Calcutta: With the RCTC top brass meaning business now, things are bound to improve. The failure of favourites since the beginning of the season has been a cause of concern in RCTC. Moreover, trainer Vijay Singhs stronger representation in Wednesdays race card may also restore normalcy to an extent. However, with Another Time and Dashing Chief making a strong bid in the afternoons main event  the 1,400m Mysore Race Club Cup  trainer Daniel David appears to enjoy a thick edge over the field. But Dashing Chiefs forward condition may help the Chief upstage stablemate.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

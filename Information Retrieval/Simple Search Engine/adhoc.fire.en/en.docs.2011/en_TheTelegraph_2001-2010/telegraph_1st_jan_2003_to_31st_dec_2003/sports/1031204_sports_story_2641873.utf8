 Valencia held goalless

(AP) Madrid: Valencia missed a chance to stretch their lead at the top of the Primera Liga when they were held to a 0-0 draw by a dominant Real Sociedad at the Anoeta on Tuesday. The leaders were in uninspired form against the Basque side who can count themselves unlucky not to have claimed their first win in six outings in a game they dominated from start to finish. Sociedad had two goals disallowed in the first half and enjoyed a host of scoring opportunities in the second, but were unable to clinch the win they deserved. The result leaves Valencia a point clear of Real Madrid. Third-placed Deportivo Coruna, who are a further point behind Real, could also overhaul Valencia if they win their match away to Valladolid. Sociedad started positively and looked to have taken an early lead when Valery Karpin poked the ball in on three minutes, but the Russians goal was ruled out for a non-existent offside. The home side had the ball in the net once more in the 32nd minute when Darko Kovacevic turned his defender and cracked in from the edge of the box but again the goal was disallowed, this time for a foul by the powerfully built striker. Valencia looked more lively at the start of the second and finally produced a shot on target when midfielder Carlos Marchena unleashed a powerful drive from the edge of the area, only to be denied by a fine one-handed save from Sander Westerveld.

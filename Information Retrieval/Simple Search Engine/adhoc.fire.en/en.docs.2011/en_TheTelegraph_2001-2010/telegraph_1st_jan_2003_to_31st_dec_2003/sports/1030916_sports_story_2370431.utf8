The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barreto strikes back at Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagans Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto on Monday strongly criticised East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick for relating the player to the on-field fracas between the two teams during the Super Division Championship Leg. The Indian Football Association (IFA) has investigated the incident on the strength of the referee and match commissioners reports as well as video clippings of that match. Bhowmick brought the matter to the IFAs notice on Sunday when he showed another video clipping in which both Barreto as well as East Bengals Mike Okoro and another club official were shown heckling the match officials. The IFA league sub-committee and disciplinary committee members will hold a one-on-one with the players on Tuesday before arriving at a final decision. It is very sad that a coach, not a club official, has raised my name for punishment. This is quite surprising, but here, anything can happen, Barreto told reporters after the Mohun Bagan-Mohammedan AC match at Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. In think he (Bhowmick) wanted to put mental pressure on us, but it didnt work today, Barreto added. Bhowmick, though, stuck to his move, saying he did it for the greater interest of football as a whole. I feel sad for the players but Im clear in my conscience. It is my fight for justice, to ensure the new interest in the game does not die a premature death. After all, I believe that condoning a crime is as punishable as committing it, he remarked. The East Bengal coach also stressed that he had the officials backing for his move. Both Bhowmick and his counterpart in the Mohun Bagan camp, Aloke Mukherjee, said the play-off should be over before the IFA Shield.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe take 2-1 lead
Harare: Andy Blignaut completed career best figures to bowl Zimbabwe to victory in the third one-day International against West Indies on Wednesday. Fast bowler Blignaut delivered a fiery second spell to take four for 43 as Zimbabwe won by 21 runs and took a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. Zimbabwe made 229 for five after losing the toss but dismissed West Indies for 208 in the 48th over. West Indies opener Chris Gayle top-scored with 61, including seven fours, his dismissal in the 40th over effectively ended the tourists challenge. The major contributions to Zimbabwes total were Mark Vermeulens 66 and an unbeaten 65 by captain Heath Streak. West Indies captain Brian Lara put the home side into bat on a cracked pitch in humid conditions but most of the Zimbabwe top and middle-order struggled to settle down. (AFP)  Copyright

 Chanderpaul to miss ODI series
Kingston: Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who hit a match-winning century in West Indies historic victory over Australia, will miss the ODI series because of a fractured finger on his left hand, officials said on Thursday. The 28-year-old left-hander, declared Man of the Match at St Johns, had surgery last night and has been advised six weeks of rest, West Indies manager Ricky Skerritt said. No replacement has been named yet. Chanderpauls absence for the seven one-day matches beginning Saturday is a further setback for the home team, which also must do without experienced wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs. The 35-year-old Antiguan has been given time to fully recover from a groin strain. THE SQUAD Brian Lara (captain), Ramnaresh Sarwan (vice-captain), Chris Gayle, Devon Smith, Marlon Samuels, Ricardo Powell, Ryan Hurley, Carlton Baugh, Omari Banks, Vasbert Drakes, Mervyn Dillon, Corey Collymore, Jermaine Lawson, David Bernard.

 Anand gifts Kasparov game
 KRAMNIK: Sole leader Linares: Viswanathan Anand suffered a rather uncharacteristic loss against world No. 1 Garri Kasparov in the seventh round of the Linares Super GM chess tournament Saturday. Russian GM Vladimir Kramnik emerged sole leader at the halfway mark with four points and is followed by Anand, Kasparov and Peter Leko, who all are on 3.5. Kramnik drew his seventh-round match against Leko. The Indian world No. 3, playing black, opted for the Caro Kann Defence and maintained the balance with exchanges at regular intervals. Kasparov could do no better than enter a rook-and-minor-pieces endgame, which put Anand under slight pressure but his position was anything but a losing one. A further trade of bishops saw the two wizards battling out a pure rook-and-pawns endgame that should have been drawn with correct play from Anand. However, the former world champion made the decisive mistake on the 57th move allowing Kasparov to wrap the issue four moves later. Kramnik tested Leko for a while in the Sicilian Sveshnikov with white pieces. Kramnik had an interesting idea in the middle game but that too failed to yield a desirable advantage. Arriving in a complex position after 25 moves, the players decided against pressing further and agreed to a draw. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ill wear Real shirt with pride, says Becks 
 Beckham was upset at being substituted by Claude Makelele after just 55 minutes against Mallorca Madrid: David Beckham is the first to admit his form has not been up to scratch since his move from Manchester United to Real Madrid but the England captain is convinced he will triumph at the Spanish club. Its a tough challenge but if I didnt believe I could do the job I wouldnt have taken it on, Beckham told reporters on Tuesday. I think I can achieve here. I can and will wear the Real Madrid shirt with pride. Beckham has played poorly in his two games in Spain, a goalless draw away to Valencia in a pre-season friendly and a 1-2 defeat by Real Mallorca in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup. He did have the satisfaction of setting up Reals goal, scored by Luis Figo, against Mallorca on Sunday with a pinpoint corner and admitted he was surprised when Figo took the next two corners that came his sides way. It was a surprise because Luis had scored from the first and then they didnt want another goal, Beckham said. The decisions about taking free kicks and corners on the field are spontaneous, though, and it depends on who is closest to the corner when its given. The England skipper also said he was upset at being substituted after just 55 minutes against Mallorca but was now looking forward to getting another chance to impress in the return on Wednesday  a match that will see him make his home debut. Any player that is substituted gets upset and Im no different, Beckham said. Its a football thing but its a long season and it will sort itself out. Id give anything to score on Wednesday. Its hard to put into words what it will feel like to run out at the Bernabeu. Beckhams mediocre displays have brought the first stirrings of criticism from the Spanish sports press but the England man is taking heart from the fact that Figo, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo all started slowly after making their moves to the Bernabeu. Im not worried about getting off to a quick start, Beckham said. Zizou (Zidane) and Ronnie (Ronaldo) both came in for criticism. Someone even said that when Zidane moved he wasnt a player fit to wear a Real Madrid shirt and hes one of the best players in the world, if not the best. Adapting to Real Madrid has been easier than I expected.  In another development Beckham said he is confident a compromise can be reached between Real Madrid and England that will allow him to play for both club and country next week. Real take on Villarreal on Wednesday or Thursday next week, but England captain Beckham is in danger of missing out on what would be his second league match of the season. England are away to Macedonia in a European Championship qualifier on September 6 and coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is likely to want his captain to join up with the rest of the squad five days early. Id like to play in both games, Beckham said. Thats the thing playing for club and country is all about  compromise. Its important to get this sorted out. Ive spoken to both bosses but its out of my hands. It will be decided by my club and my country, but therell be no argument.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes illness upsets friend Sachin
	 - Maestro sends best wishes via sms, Sourav is distressed  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  A 2002 file picture of Leander and Sachin at a promo for the sports goods maker they endorse  Bangalore: Its not been a publicised friendship,  but Sachin Tendulkar and Leander Paes have been pals for  almost a decade. Its no surprise, then, that Leanders  hospitalisation in the US has upset contemporary crickets  No. 1 star. I heard about it on the TV in  the morning and, well, it came as really bad news... Ive  sent an SMS and, like the rest of the country, will be praying  that Leanders illness isnt serious, Sachin told The  Telegraph on Wednesday evening, soon after returning  to the Grand Ashok from a Karnataka government function. In fact, Sachin was curious whether there was an update during the time he was away from the TV  first, at the conditioning camp and, then, at the function. Have you heard anything different? he asked, in that tone of much concern. Actually, without even waiting for an answer, Sachin added: Leanders such an easy guy to get along with... It was in the mid-Nineties that he met me during a game in Calcutta and, since then, weve grown to admire each others play... That both of us promote Adidas has, obviously, brought us together on quite a few occasions... While they havent met for some months, both have been in contact through SMS ever since Sachin decided to use a mobile  significantly, largely to allow his mother stay in touch whenever he is on the move. Sachin, of course, hasnt watched any Leander match in person, but recalled that Indias tennis ace did make an appearance during our 1999-2000 tour of Australia. I just hope things will be fine, he concluded, beginning to return some of the calls taken by the hotel in his absence. Incidentally, Sachin (a John McEnroe fan) was hooked on tennis till the 1983 World Cup changed everything. Meanwhile, Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, who also knows Leander (a fellow Calcuttan) well enough, said he was distressed and was hoping that the multiple tests dont throw up anything crushing.  For those who need a gentle reminder, it was in 1996  that both Sourav and Leander had their finest moments: One  got a Test hundred on debut at Lords, the other collected  bronze at the Atlanta Olympics.

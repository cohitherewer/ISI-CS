The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Andhra all out for 30
Mohali: Andhra Pradesh collapsed to their second lowest total when they were skittled out for a mere 30 runs in 17.4 overs by Punjab on the opening day of their Elite group A Ranji Trophy match here on Wednesday. Speedsters Gagandeep Singh and Vineet Sharma picked five wickets each to wreak havoc on the visitors after they were put into bat by Punjab skipper Dinesh Mongia. In reply, Punjab were comfortably placed at 141 for three at close of play. Pankaj Dharmani was batting on 36 while Ravneet Ricky was dismissed just before close for 20. Earlier, Andhra collapsed like a pack of cards with Y. Ganeshwar Rao (11) being the only batsman to reach double figures. Andhras lowest-ever total is 29 made against Tamil Nadu in Coimbatore, 1978. Southern Punjabs 22 against Northern India at Amritsar in 1934-35 is the overall lowest in Ranji Trophy. Captain M. S. K. Prasad was among the seven batsmen who failed to open their account against Gagandeeps inspired spell. Sharma then polished off the tail giving away just three runs in the 4.4 overs he bowled. In Mumbai, Amol Muzumdar (91 batting) helped Mumbai finish on 236 for five on Wednesday. SUMMARISED SCORES  In Ahmedabad: Gujarat 210 (Akash Christian  35, Bhavin Thakker 50; Dodda Ganesh 5/61).

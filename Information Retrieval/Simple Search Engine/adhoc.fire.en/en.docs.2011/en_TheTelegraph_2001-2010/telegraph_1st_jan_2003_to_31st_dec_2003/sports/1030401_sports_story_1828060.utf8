The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agassis drama has more of form than theatrics
 BY JOHN PARSONS IN KEY BISCAYNE  Andre Agassi with the trophy after winning the Miami Masters title at Key Biscayne Sunday Andre Agassi marches on. Looking as sprightly, confident and competent as when he won his first title here in 1990, the 32-year-old American became Nasdaq-100 Open champion Sunday for a remarkable sixth time after a 6-3, 6-3 win over Carlos Moya. The 26-year-old Spaniard, who had shown ample evidence earlier in the tournament that he is rapidly restoring the form which made him world No. 1  albeit for only two weeks  in 1999, could not divert the American from his record-breaking path. Agassis wife, Steffi Graf, who won the womens title here five times, joined in the ovation, as her husband followed his well-worn path of lifting his game at precisely the right moments for his third consecutive Key Biscayne, worth 330,000. The 70-minute encounter will be remembered more for Agassis superb tennis than any drama. With him breaking for 3-1 in the first set and again for 4-3 in the second, there was never any serious hint of an upset even though he had played three days in succession and Moya had enjoyed a free day on Saturday. Once again we admired Agassis range of talents  his ability to vary pace, to make full use of the court and serve so effectively that he won 31 of his 33 service points. In addition, an immaculately played serve-and-volley point denied Moya one break point in the third game, while an ace and a service winner prevented him from immediately breaking back in the second set. Moya said: The difference was the respective serves. Im supposed to serve better than him but I didnt. Only in my first service game (when he saved three break points) was I comfortable with my serve. He puts you under so much pressure with his returns and didnt give me any chances. On top of that I wasnt able to return at all. The way Serena Williams kept the womens title in the family for the fifth time in six years reinforced the belief that she has become as dominant a force in womens tennis as Tiger Woods in golf. Explaining her often careless, sluggish approach during the first two sets of her 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 defeat of Jennifer Capriati, the Wimbledon and world champion said: I think I was just being lazy and not working hard enough, expecting the win to come without moving my feet. It was during this period that Williams committed most of her 42 unforced errors, less than when she also beat Capriati in the final here a year earlier, but more worrying because it followed an equally relatively shoddy semi-final performance against Kim Clijsters. Both let her off the hook. Williams, who would love to go through the year unbeaten but feels its probably impossible, promises to respond to this wake-up call. Ive slacked off a little but Ill be back in South Carolina (next week) and Im actually going to the gym. I havent done so for about four weeks and I think my trainers upset about that. Instead of taking this week off, Williams said she was going to practise. I dont think Ive been practising enough. Thats why my form is off. Williams, whose first thought after her second success at a tournament won three times by older sister, Venus, was to concentrate on winning the French Open again, admitted that instead of practising between tournaments she has simply been hanging out, relaxing and not working. I cant keep doing it like that. Theres people out there working hard and coming closer.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

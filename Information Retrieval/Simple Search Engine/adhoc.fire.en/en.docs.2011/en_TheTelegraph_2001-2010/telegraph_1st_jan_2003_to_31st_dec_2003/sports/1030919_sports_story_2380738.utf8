Three more national records were set on the day. While the Karnataka women broke their own record (9:06.29) in the 4x200m free-style relay with a timing of 9:01.27, the Police men broke the record, held by Railways, in the same event.

Former national champion Sebastian Xavier had a forgettable end to his career in an individual event when he was disqualified inspite of finishing second in the mens 50m for a false start. T.A.

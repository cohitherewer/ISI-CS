 BCCI not willing to sit on laurels 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: It has been one of the most successful years for the Indian team in recent memory, but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is not ready to sit on the laurels. On the eve of the boards Annual General Meeting, president Jagmohan Dalmiya spoke about its achievements over the 2002-03 season: The BCCI is the facilitator for forward movement. We dont want to sit on what we have achieved over the year. He added that everyone, starting from the president himself, is accountable. Every one has to perform to help Indian cricket move forward. The BCCI also gave a video presentation of its activities over the season. The show was organised by the communications and co-ordination committee, chaired by Rajya Sabha MP Rajiv Shukla. Dalmiya said the BCCI is trying to introduce a cultural change with the induction of modern techniques. Weve brought in foreign coaches and physical fitness experts which have been a big boost. Also, the proposal to have a physical trainer for every affiliated unit is a step in the right direction. But does the fact that Team Indias support crew comprises so many foreigners worry the BCCI president? Not at all. The foreign support staff will obviously not continue for eternity. As of now, by interacting with these foreigners, Indian coaches, trainers and physiotherapists are getting the much-needed exposure. That day is not far away when other countries will seek our help in these departments, Dalmiya said. Also, seeking foreign assistance does not mean the board is forgetting the rich traditions of Indian cricket. Spin has always been one of the strong points of Indian cricket and we organised a spinners conclave which was a success.  According to the president, one of the most notable achievements of the BCCI is that India can boast of a solid reserve bench these days. This has been possible due to the number of under-19 and A team tours abroad, he added.  Copyright

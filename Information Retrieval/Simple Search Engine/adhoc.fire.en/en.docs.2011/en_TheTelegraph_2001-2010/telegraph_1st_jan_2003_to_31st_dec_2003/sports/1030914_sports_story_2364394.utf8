The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kapils turn to do the talking 
 - 'Positive thinking' lectures across countryngive the legend  'a big kick'
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta, Sept.13: Twentyfive years ago, when Kapil Dev made his India debut in Quetta, many insisted the somewhat gawky Jat was fit to be lectured on just about everything. Today, style-icon Kapil is doing the talking  on positive thinking and more. From IIMs to the corporate sector, schools and universities The former captain and coach has quietly been scoring on a different wicket  pretty much like present Australia coach John Buchanan. Be positive and enjoy were key elements of Kapils cricket. Understandably, in his lectures, that hasnt changed. Ill be satisfied if even one individual gets to wholly believe in positive thinking and makes the most of thatGenerally, theres a tendency to be negative when, in fact, we should be looking at what we can accomplish he told The Telegraph this afternoon, speaking on his cellphone. Kapils own josh-filled attitude helped him to 5,248 Test runs (eight hundreds) and 434 wickets, besides 3,783 ODI runs (one hundred) and 253 wickets. Initially reluctant to talk about his lectures, he acknowledged getting a big kick out of the exercise: My commitments with Sony and Kinetic dont leave much time for anything else However, I try and accommodate the lectures Yes, Ive been enjoying the role of speaker. According to Kapil, the janatas response during shoots for a TV programme encouraged him to formally dwell on positive thinking. Look, my message is simple: Think you can do it Let that be the driving force...Moreover, dont shy away from picking up the positive traits of others. You could be good, but somebody may well be betterSo, learn from that person, he pointed out. Kapil added: My theme doesnt change with a change in audienceBe it at a university or with senior executives, I stick to the basics of being positive. While most see Indias only World Cup-winning captain as the No.1 example of being positive, he himself feels Nelson Mandela and Mohinder Amarnath rank higher than anybody. Despite decades in prison, Mandela never hated his tormentors Rather, he focussed on the positive aspects of life and, currently, is admired both by Whites and Blacks His approach should serve as an eye-opener. As for Mohinder, I think even he wont remember the number of comebacks He kept bouncing back and served Indian cricket splendidly Had Mohinder not been positive, though, he would have faded out after being dropped for the very first time (following the 1969-70 home series versus Australia). Actually, he was a survivor for 20 years Asked whether Team India 2003 needed a pro motivator, Kapil replied: If it helps, why not? After all, hasnt the world changed? But, yes, the boys must be exposed to the right person Also, they have to be comfortable with the frequency of that interaction Incidentally, positive thinking took centrestage during his recent closed-door session with the probables in Bangalore. I didnt just speak about cricket and, really, mujhe maaza aa gaya, he quipped. Kapil didnt reveal where he was headed next  to an IIM or a gathering of dealers  but confirmed being committed to the lecture circuit. Happy listening.  Copyright

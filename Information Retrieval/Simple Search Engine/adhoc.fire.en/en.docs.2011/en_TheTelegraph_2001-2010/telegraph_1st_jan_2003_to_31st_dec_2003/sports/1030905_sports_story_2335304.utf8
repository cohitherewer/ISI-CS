The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jugraj shouldnt rush return
 We re-establishd ourselves as the 'bad boys' of world hockey
 Stickworth / Gurbax singh The news of Jugraj Singhs accident  was shocking. It is a huge setback for Indian hockey. Jugraj  is one gutsy lad. In the few years that he has been around  in the international arena, he has come out as a front-ranking  defender-scorer. I remember the way he took the  fast drag-flicks of Pakistans Sohail Abbas, the fastest  hitter in the world today, on his body and how he then went  ahead and scored too. It was a show of brilliance and sheer  guts. Let me tell you that if doctors feel the injury is  a fully curable one, you will see much more of him. However, under no circumstances  should Jugraj hurry on his way back. This could end his  career prematurely. We have seen this in the case of Rajeev  Mishra who tried to push his recovery. He did not get the  best treatment. Even if Jugraj misses the Athens Olympics,  he should give his injury time to heal properly. And I ask  for all, including the government and the IHF, to provide  him the best possible treatment. Jugraj still has eight-nine years  of good hockey left in him. He can afford this wait. Jugrajs injury will be a setback  for the team. He improved through the last few outings and  had become one of the pillars of the team. There is talk  of Baljit Singh Dhillon taking over the penalty corner duties,  but Jugraj will be missed in the defence. Coming back to the Indian performance  in the last Champions Trophy, what we basically did was  only re-establish ourselves as the bad boys of world hockey.  The campaign started with a lot of hope. However, firstly  we forgot that in our preceding assignments, in Australia  and Germany, we had lost to both the host teams. That did  dilute our wins. We didnt carry this knowledge into the  Champions Trophy. Secondly, we dont realise that  arguing with umpires is a pastime that neither the FIH nor  the sport around the world in general thinks very well of. We do need to make several adjustments.  They range from the very preliminary stuff like trapping   something we are atrocious at  to sorting the jumble  in our heads. There has to be a basic change in attitude  in the players, and there has to be some method through  which the Indian players can be coached. I believe Indian hockey players  are simply not conducive to coaching. This is not because  of any special anathema they have against coaches, but,  unlike other disciplines, a hockey player grows up sans  a coach and sans any level of strict discipline that is  necessary in team play. Consider the school level, and  the club level these days. Where are the coaches? Who are  the people who would be expected to take the players through  the paces in passing, trapping, the basics of the game,  and most importantly, the discipline? Even in clubs, you  have coaches who see to it that the player is provided  with a hockey stick, required ancillary kit and balls. Then  they are expected to take control of situations and expected  to move through a defence line, a blueprint for which isnt  available. Coaches step in only at national  levels. A sudden shift from the do-it-yourself scenario. It is a question of a general  level of education, too, but that isnt lacunae enough in  theory classes. The idea, and this is a dangerous trend  I say, is to not take any notice of what the coach may be  saying once you have reached a certain level in the sport  in the country. It is the general belief that the star player  always outlasts the coach in the team. The frequent change  in coaches in the national side lends credence to this theory. Consider the Champions Trophy.  I believe superstar Dhanraj Pillay is to be blamed in the  main for the unruly nature of the players. There has to  be some knowledge of the rules that an umpire is required  to enforce. Today an umpire has the power to change a penalty  corner award to a penalty stroke award in case of an unruly  protest. He also has the power to withdraw a penalty corner  award to an attacking side if it insists on demanding a  stroke. These are aspects that have to  be kept in mind. The stars quarrel more  Pillay, Baljit  Singh Dhillon, Baljit Saini, Jugraj One has to remember  that when such a star is booked and has to spend time outside  the ground, the team does not benefit from his absence. Id like to take into account  the following that needs to be worked upon.  Consistency (play is in patches)  Too many ifs and buts  Improvement in basics: trapping  is faulty, time is wasted in controlling  No right-in or right wing, attack  too lopsided in left bias  Playing with practically three  forwards, Pillay between the half-backs and forwards, a  basically no-mans land of little use  Too much holding onto the ball  and delaying the passes  Defenders scared to tackle and  commit, allowing in rival attackers  Poor defending to counter-attacks Conceding unnecessary penalty  corners  No plan for free-hits from outside  the circle  you hit in hard and pray for the best  Unable to enforce penalty corners. All that, while I notice a lack  of mental toughness, low level of game maturity, lack of  knowledge of own weaknesses and low levels of concentration.  That doesnt make me feel good. And all this, while the Indians  can really play good hockey. Only it comes out in those  rather small bursts, too insignificant sometimes, in the  international arena. Copyright

		 Sunday, December 21, 2003  Own Vision romps home 
 BY STAR RACER Prakash on Own Vision Obligado (partly  seen) winning the Eveready Calcutta Gold Cup from Allodium  at the RCTC on Saturday 				 										Calcutta, Dec. 20: Daniel Davids ward, Own Vision, kept her date with the Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks on Saturday. The 4-7 hot-favourite was hardly tested over the 2,400m trip when she trounced her five rivals. B. Prakash partnered the Razeen-Treasure Land three-year-old daughter.				 										The Eveready Calcutta Gold Cup, in contrast, produced a thrilling finish with two Narredus  Mallesh and Suraj  in the field of nine, making it a family affair. It was a a great sight  a fight between experience of Mallesh and youth of Suraj  that set the stands alight. However, Malleshs 12-10 favourite Obligado, from D. Byramjis yard, prevailed over nephew Surajs Allodium after a grim battle for supremacy in the last 250m of the 1,600m race. Suraj did lose the battle on the seven-year-old Allodium but not before he won the hearts of the Saturday crowd.				 										Vijay Singhs Almara made an impressive debut in the Breeders Cup. The Brave Hunter-Cool Tempo filly lost some ground at the start and yet triumphed handsomely in the hands of C. Rajendra who also booted home Bharath Singhs Arrayal in the Time Machine Cup.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

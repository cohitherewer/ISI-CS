The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Curators crossed fingers
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Port Elizabeth: Usually, captains and coaches are a hassled lot, especially on the eve of a World Cup semi-final. At St Georges Park, Monday, curator Adrian Carter had a much more creased forehead. All, of course, owing to concern about the slow and low wickets in the four matches so far. Look, the effort has been to produce good one-day wickets. However, conditions are such that... the boyish Carter  he is only 29  trailed off, while talking to The Telegraph. Carter, though, was quick to remind that the quicks actually had a ball in the two games  Australia versus England and Australia against New Zealand  where the wicket was heavily criticised. Andy Bichel took seven for 20 versus England, while Shane Bond returned figures of six for 23 against Australia. Moreover, in the same match, Brett Lee took five for 42. The semi-final, however, will be played on the wicket which hosted the first game  New Zealand versus the West Indies, on February 13. Batting first, New Zealand scored 241 for seven and, then, dismissed the West Indies for 221. Weve worked hard on the wicket... Now, its up to the guys to get some runs, Carter remarked, rubbishing a report that the United Cricket Board had rushed Centurions Hilbert Smith to supervise preparations. Stories can keep flying about. Fact is, I myself requested Hilbert to come over. Having said that, wickets here wont be like the Wanderers or the one in Centurion, Carter pointed out. While Sri Lankan coach Dav Whatmore declined to comment (Im not an authority), Australias John Buchanan said the wicket looked the best of the three seen by his team. For good measure, he added: Whatever the wicket, our job is to play... That should make Carter, possibly the youngest curator at a Test venue, sleep easy.  Copyright

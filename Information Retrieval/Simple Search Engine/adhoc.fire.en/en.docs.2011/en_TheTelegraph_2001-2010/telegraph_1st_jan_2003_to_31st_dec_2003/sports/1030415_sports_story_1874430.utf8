The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB favourites: Barreto 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto of Mohun Bagan feels Vasco SC stand no chance against current leaders East Bengal in their match on April 25, which is being billed as the virtual title-decider of the seventh edition of the National Football League. East Bengal are far superior to them (Vasco). And more importantly, the match will be played here at Salt Lake Stadium and that will make the difference, Barreto said on Monday. The Brazilian also praised the rival club as the most balanced team and the deserving winners of the League. Their players are fit and the bench strength is simply too good. They fully deserve the title, he said of East Bengal. Speaking after the Mohun Bagan-Tollygunge Agragami match, Barreto regretted that failing to help Mohun Bagan defend the title was painful. It is doubtless my worst season for the club, he maintained. He, however, attributed this failure to the exodus of some key players like James Singh and Debjit Ghosh from the last years winning team. We have missed some vital players this year. Besides, our midfield sometimes has failed to deliver (in crunch matches), he said. Barreto leaves for his native land for a two-month break. Hes also not playing Mohun Bagans final match against HAL.  Copyright

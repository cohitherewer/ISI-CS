The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rohans 173 in mammoth total
 Rohan is making most of the opportunity Pune: Riding on brilliant centuries by Rohan Gavaskar and Gautam Gambhir, India A took a lead of 216 runs on the penultimate day of the second cricket Test against Sri Lanka A on Monday. Resuming at their overnight score of 203 for three, India A posted a mammoth 556 for seven, thanks to the sparkling performance by Rohan. The Bengal captain slammed 173 off 308 balls with 12 hits to the fence while Gambhir hit 131 off 218 balls with 19 boundaries. Wicketkeeper Ajay Ratra chipped in with 68 runs before being stumped by Prasanna Jayawardene off R. Hearth. Ramesh Powar, who hit two sixes, remained not out on 64. The performance of the India A batsmen put the home team in a strong position. For Sri Lanka A, K. Weerratne and Hearth took two wickets each. Powar and Murali Kartik were at the crease when stumps were drawn. Rohan, who was picked for the Challenger Trophy as well as the Irani Trophy earlier this year, is making good use of these opportunities. After a good knock in the Challenger meet, he also scored a solid 60-odd against the Sri Lankans in the drawn first Test in Ahmedabad  (PTI)  Copyright

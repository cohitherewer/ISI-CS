The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Set goals at every stage and try to surpass them: Lara
 - Great batsmen wish to have a distance between them and the rest, says the West Indies captain  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Brian Lara relaxes  in his city hotel suite on Sunday. Picture by Aranya  Sen Being the owner of the most coveted individual records (highest Test and first-class score) in cricket, Brian Charles Lara doesnt require a visiting card. Actually, the MRF brand ambassador wouldnt require one even if he wasnt a double world record-holder. Lara, who spent two days in Calcutta for a promotional, spoke to The Telegraph for around 35 minutes (in his hotel suite) on Sunday afternoon. It was the West Indies captains first  and, possibly, only  one-to-one interaction over the two days. Owing to time constraints, however, the interview was largely confined to batting. The 34-year-old Lara, by the way, has himself totalled 21 hundreds in Tests (51.55 average) and 17 in ODIs (average of 43.10). The following are excerpts On the qualities needed by batsmen aspiring for the big league Look, at the highest grade, most batsmen have natural ability Whats most important is self-belief and being tough in the mind You may have the skills, but wont get very far if you dont have that mental strength In fact, if you study the careers of top batsmen, you will come across occasions when they were mentally challenged If they are great, its because they won that battle. On the extent to which a batsman can improve Depends on his commitment Cricket is a team game and, so, theres a mix of individuals I mean, youre bound to have some average batsmen. At the same time, they too must play a part Personally, I dont think a situation should be encouraged whereby only the better ones do the bulk of the work Clearly, theres a role for everybody and the average batsmen must have the commitment and discipline to improve. Agreed, not everybody is going to be great, but you must aspire to be remembered as a batsman who made good contributions. On what separates a great batsman from the rest (Smiles) The desire to lift his game to another level and not remain content being at the top of the pile The great ones wish to have a distance between them and the rest Of course, this holds true for sportsmen in general, not just batsmen A truly great sportsman will put in double the work even though he has been blessed with exceptional talent Look at a Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods or a Michael Schumacher On his idols The late Roy Fredericks and (Sir) Viv Richards Actually, Ive also learnt from other players The Gordon Greenidges and Desmond Haynes [Incidentally, apart from Jordon, Woods and Schumacher, Laras heroes outside cricket are footballers Zinedine Zidane and (fellow-West Indian) Dwight Yorke.] On the dos and donts for batsmen The fundamentals are the same for every batsman Essentially, you must be disciplined and should look to laying a foundation Obviously, youve got to cut down on the risks (Adds laughing) Not too long ago, even I was considered a risk-taking batsman The lesser the risk, the better your chances of flourishing. On whether he has consciously cut down on risks Greater knowledge about the art of batting and maturity have played a part My own batting is driven by mental approach and visualisation Very often, people have talked about my technique and That my bat is going too high up and However, Ive never allowed that to be a big issue because, then, it would be a distraction. Whatever success Ive achieved is largely due to my mental strength. On whether rankings and labels matter Early on in my career, yes, I did want to move up the ladder When in the early 20s, one looks for security Thats only natural Later, though, you cant be driven by individual rankings Youve got to carry the team along Today, as the West Indies captain, Im focussed on getting the team to move up (After a pause) Its nice to be No.1 or whatever, but that shouldnt ever be the sole cause for satisfaction. On being a matchwinner As a youngster, I aspired to be on top of the pile and, once there, the pressure bit has to be accepted That comes with being the most prized wicket In the long run, however, no team should depend on one batsman or bowler. For quite some time, everything was expected from me only. Now, Im happy to say the West Indies team is moving away from that For a confirmation, you just have to look at this years Antigua Test We scripted the greatest run chase ever but, in getting to that winning score (418 for seven), my contribution was no more than 60. On where would he rate himself on a scale of 10 (Interrupting) Ive never rated myself On whether captaincy can affect a batsman-captain Yes, indeed Equally, added responsibility could enhance an individuals game If the leadership qualities are there, those shouldnt be stifled. Am I any different in my second innings as captain? Well, Im certainly a better listener and experience has made a difference Today, Ive got a more holistic view of what leading the West Indies is all about (Again, after a pause) Captains dont go to a leadership-specific finishing school They learn on the job and its never easy On the structure of cricket in the West Indies Theres room for improvement I dont sit on meetings and so on but, yes, a case can be made out for calling upon the experience of former players Am I worried that kids back home are being drawn to baseball and basketball? No. On his message for the young ones By all means have a role model, but dont simply look to emulate him Rather, set goals at every stage and try to surpass them To speak of myself, be it in school or at the provincial level, I always wanted to be No.1 Each time I achieved one goal, I was inspired to go for the next. Finally, on himself (Smiles again) Im more responsible Given my position in West Indies cricket, I have to be so While I avoid fanatical fans, Im pretty affable and anybody could walk up and talk about interesting things I admit being in the limelight is tough, yet I make the effort to have a few quiet moments I quite like the US where I can simply get lost in a crowd No cameras, no fans  Copyright

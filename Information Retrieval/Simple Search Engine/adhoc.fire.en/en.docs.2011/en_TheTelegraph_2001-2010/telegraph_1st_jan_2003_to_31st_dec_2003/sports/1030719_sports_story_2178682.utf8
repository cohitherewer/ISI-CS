The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gough in, not Thorpe
 Gough is back in a Test squad after two years London: Pace bowler Darren Gough, who has not played the longer version of the game for two years, was recalled to the England squad on Friday for the first Test against South Africa starting at Edgbaston next Thursday. Gough, 32, whose international career appeared finished because of long-term knee problems, performed well in the recent tri-series against South Africa and Zimbabwe. He wins back his place at the expense of Richard Johnson, who has been suffering from a groin injury. We need his experience and his quality, said England chairman of selectors David Graveney. However, there is no room for Surrey left-hander Graham Thorpe, who opted out of the Ashes tour of Australia because of personal problems. Anthony McGrath, who scored two half-centuries against Zimbabwe, retains his place in the middle-order. Thorpe, Englands best middle-order batsman over the past 10 years, said last weekend he was keen to play for his country again. Robert Key has been dropped.

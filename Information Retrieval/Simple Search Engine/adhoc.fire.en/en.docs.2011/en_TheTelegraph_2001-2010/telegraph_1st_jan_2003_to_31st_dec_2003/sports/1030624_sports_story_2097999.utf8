 Kaye clinches maiden title
Harrison (New York): Jonathan Kaye clinched his maiden PGA Tour title at the rain-affected Buick Classic on Sunday, sinking a 12-foot eagle putt at the first extra hole to edge out John Rollins. Both players had closed with final rounds of four-under-par 67 to complete the regulation 72 holes at 13-under 271. Joey Sindelar fired a closing 68 to finish third at 11 under. World No. 1 Tiger Woods returned a 70 to share 13th place at seven-under 277. (Reuters)  Copyright

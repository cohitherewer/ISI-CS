 ICC plans Bangladesh improvement
Dhaka, May 17 (AFP): The ICC has vowed to reverse Bangladeshs cricketing fortunes after repeated defeats in Test and one-dayers, an official said Saturday. I honestly tried to point out specific areas where the ICC could render support to make Bangladesh more competitive as quickly as possible, Andrew Eade, ICCs Global Development Manager, said before leaving Dhaka at the end of a two-day visit. The ICC wants to bring about significant changes in terms of result-oriented progress in Bangladesh cricket within a short span of time, he added. Eade said the ICC would help whittle down lists for a Chief Executive Officer of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and a high-profile coach for the under-19 team as well as assisting and monitoring strategic plans. We also want to help build a national training centre with modern facilities and to restart specialised training programmes and to lobby the Asian Cricket Council to fund development activities in Bangladesh, he said. Despite the general concern about the Bangladesh teams poor performance, Eade was confident that the BCBs present plans would help change the situation. Some quarters have questioned the ICCs decision to give Bangladesh Test status in 2000.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arsenal win 2-1
London, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Premier League leaders Arsenal showed typical resilience in beating Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at Highbury on Saturday to preserve their unbeaten record this season and go four points clear at the top. Freddie Ljungbergs deflected winner in the 78th minute settled a tight derby after Robert Pires had cancelled out Darren Andertons early strike for Spurs. But bottom club Leeds Uniteds problems intensified after they crashed 6-1 at Portsmouth. Charlton Athletic went fourth in the table after a 3-1 home victory over Fulham. Arsenal have 30 points, four more than Chelsea and five more than champions Manchester United, both of whom play on Sunday. Charlton have 21 points.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, December 20, 2003  Own Vision for Oaks 
 BY STAR RACER Daniel Vijay 				 										Calcutta: A virtual festival of racing begins from Saturday with eight race events which may unfold very exciting sport, thanks to the three events major races on the cards  the 2,400m Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks, the 1,600m Eveready Calcutta Gold Cup and the Breeders Cup over an 1,100m scurry. The combined value of the three sweepstakes races is marginally short of rupees one million mark. More importantly, the first two being graded races and well represented by outstation challengers, a hoard of outstation champion riders will be seen in action. 				 										Own Vision looks cut above her five rivals vying for the third classic, the Oaks. The Razeen-Treasure Land daughter, though outclassed by Psychic Flame in the fillies Guineas, is a thorough stayer and may find the Derby trip more to her advantage. B. Prakash partneres the Daniel David-trainee.				 										The Gold Cup, on the other hands, may turn out to be a close tussle among Obligado, Network, Noble Executive and Attorney.  all four-year-olds who are in a different league compared to the local challengers. Although the terms of the race favours Noble Executive, the Daniel-ward does not seem to be in the form that had helped him finish ahead of the other three in the recent past down South. Accustomed to the local track and the environment, it is Network who may defy all logics and the Vijay Singh-trained horse may win in the hands of C. Alford.

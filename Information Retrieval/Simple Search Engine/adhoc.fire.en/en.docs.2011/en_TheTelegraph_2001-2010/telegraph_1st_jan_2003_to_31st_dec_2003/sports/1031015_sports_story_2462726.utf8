 Mankad in Round 2 
Belgaum: Harsh Mankad entered the second round of the ATP Challenger but fellow-Indians Mustafa Ghouse and Sunil Kumar Sipaeya were eliminated. Mankad edged out Briton James Auckland 6-7 (4-7), 7-5, 7-6 (7-4). His next opponent will be unseeded Swiss Stephane Bohli, who knocked out third seed Michal Mertinak of Slovakia 7-6 (7-3), 6-2. Sipaeya raised his game in the second set but it wasnt good enough against Branislav Sekac. The Slovak won 6-1, 7-6 (10-8). It was a different story with Ghouse. The national grasscourt champion lost 2-6, 6-4, 4-6 to Slovak Victor Bruthans. Fourth seed Rik de Voest beat Michael Lammer of Britain 7-6 (9-7), 6-3.  (PTI  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nakata denial 
Tokyo: Parma midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata has blasted media reports linking him to Italian rivals Lazio, insisting such stories were pure rumour. You shouldnt believe everything you read in the newspapers or see on TV, the Japan captain told his official website. Most of it is pure rumour. People spin the truth to start rumours all the time. The press should stick to reporting about the facts. Nakata has struggled to establish himself at Parma since joining from AS Roma for $26 m two years ago.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

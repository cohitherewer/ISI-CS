 Yuvraj fails again
London: Yuvraj Singhs poor run for Yorkshire continued as he was dismissed for nine in their key one-day Frizzell Championship match against Kent at Tunbridge Wells Sunday. Yorkshire, chasing Kents 208 for 7, could manage only 186 for 9 in 45 overs, losing by 22 runs. Yorkshire now face an uphill struggle to ensure their place in the first division. They looked well-placed to overhaul the target of 209, but a fine nine-over spell by Ben Trott saw the return of Chris Silverwood, Matthew Wood and Yuvraj for 19 runs. Yuvraj failed to click with the ball too, going wicketless for 22 runs.  (PTI)  Copyright

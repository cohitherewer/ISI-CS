 East Zone table tennis in national-state body tussle
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Aug. 2: The East Zone table tennis championship is set to become the bone of contention between the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) and the Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA). It is learnt that though the meet may be hosted in the city, the BTTA may not have a role to play in it. According to the TTFI brass, they plan to host the tournament on their own without help from the state association. The tournament was originally scheduled to take place in Jamshedpur in August, but the Jharkhand association backed out at the last moment. If its an entirely TTFI organised event, it is likely to take place at the SAI, Eastern Centre. However, if the TTFI does go ahead with its plans, the BTTA authorities will take up the matter. When the tournament went to Jharkhand in spite of our bidding, we didnt say anything. Now Jharkhand backed out and we have made a fresh bidding. But, if they still dont award the meet to us, we will fight till the end, a top BTTA official said, adding that, it could become an issue involving the state government if such a decision is carried out. It has also been learnt that the tournament is likely to be deferred till November because a number of international tournaments are just round the corner. The TTFI will send their senior and junior teams to Pyongyang and Toronto in the third week of August for two international meets. Also, the Asian Junior meet is round the corner.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Club throws out Olonga
Harare: Zimbabwe fast bowler Henry Olonga has been sacked by his Harare-based cricket club on Thursday after continuing a World Cup protest against President Robert Mugabes government. Olonga, who plays for Takashinga, said: Theyve withdrawn my subscription which means Im out of the club. But Im free to play for another club and thats what Ill do. Im glad it was sorted out amicably. Olonga and teammate Andy Flower sported black armbands in their opening Group A game against Namibia in protest against the death of democracy in Zimbabwe. The Zimbawean cricket authorities reported them to the International Cricket Council for bringing the game into disrepute. The parent body did not charge the pair but asked them not to wear the armbands again. Flower and Olonga responded by exchanging them for black wristbands during Wednesdays game in Harare against India. Flower had retained his place against India but Olonga was dropped and acted as 12th man. Zimbabwe was suspended from the Commonwealth last year after allegations that Mugabe had rigged polls. Around half the countrys 14- million people are suffering food shortages, a crisis which Mugabe critics have blamed in part on his policy of redistributing white-owned farms to landless blacks.

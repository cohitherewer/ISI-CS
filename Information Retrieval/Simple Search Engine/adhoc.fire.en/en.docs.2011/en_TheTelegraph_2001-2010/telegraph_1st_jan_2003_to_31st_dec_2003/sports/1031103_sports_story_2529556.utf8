The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan make EB toil for title
 BY SUJIT BHAR  Calcutta: Ashim Biswas  brilliant first-half goal was neutralised with a penalty  conversion by Suley Musah in the latter session, and the  deadlock was taken into sudden-death shootouts before East  Bengal clinched their 29th IFA league title at the Salt  Lake Stadium Sunday with a 6-5 aggregate verdict over Mohun  Bagan. The form book was proving true, the way most first half sorties looked. Following an early Biswas-Rennedy misdirected adventure, there were East Bengal attacks on all menus. That was also when the saga of misses for the red-gold brigade started. Okoros seventh-minute shot came off the crosspiece during a pressure situation in the Mohun Bagan box. It was a good ploy to use Alvito DCunha as dummy and in switching flanks in attack as Bhaichung Bhutia was expectedly kept on a marker leash. While Bhaichung took his minders off the line, Okoro could penetrate. But Sunday, unfortunately, Okoros only blind spot was the goal. Despite the defensive Bagan formation, there were deceptive individual moves, like Rennedy Singhs, in the 13th minute. He sped across off a counter-attack move and floated across the goalline. As the ball swerved, Sangram Mukherjee, under the East Bengal bar, managed to palm it away. Not surprisingly, coach Subhas Bhowmicks strategy of trying to keep Suley Musah down to sweeper did not work. The East Bengal skipper loped up often in attack, and in the 23rd minute passed at the goalmouth to Okoro. From very close range, Okoro headed out, shooting in a tearing hurry. The relief in the Bagan defence was translated into a tearaway counter-attack through Lolendra Singh that Biswas picked up 25 yards from the goal. Biswas received, and finding Sangram well advanced of his charge swiftly lobbed the ball over the keepers head. The ball looped onto the goalline and bounced into the roof of the netting. It can easily be termed as one of the best goals of this league. The general rhythm was disturbed, but attacks continued on either side  Rennedy messing up at one end, Musah heading over from close at the other. All through, though Bhaichung seemed pretty much low-key. He was marked alright, but for a player of his class this was hardly a handicap. Biswas did break free of his markers for Bagan. East Bengal mounted concerted attacks in the second half and 17 minutes into the session, in a goalmouth melee, the ball took Manitombi Singhs hand. Maybe the ball would have gone elsewhere than the goal, but it was Fifa referee Kamaleswaran Shankars decision to award the penalty. Musah converted with ease to restore parity. Play could have been competitive yet, but Biswas pulled a muscle and had to be pulled out of action (coach Aloke Mukherjee later said it was neither the old injury nor was it serious). That put the reins on Bagans adventures. Action gravitated towards midfield till regulation time ended. Soccer in extra time was dull despite coach Mukherjee pushing in Sunil Chhetri. Maybe he made a mistake in substituting youngster Bilifang Narzary with Imran Khan under the bar. Khan remained unsettled in this big match situation. Bagans Marcos Parreira shot onto the crosspiece in the first of the shootouts, but Bhaichung returned the compliment when he shot onto the left post. Palash Karmakars rising shot was saved by Sangram, but Alvitos powerful chip took the crosspiece and went off from the goalline immediately after. East Bengals troubled title-clash finally ended when Mehtab Hossains chip in the sudden death was saved by Sangram and Mahesh Gawli slotted home.  Copyright

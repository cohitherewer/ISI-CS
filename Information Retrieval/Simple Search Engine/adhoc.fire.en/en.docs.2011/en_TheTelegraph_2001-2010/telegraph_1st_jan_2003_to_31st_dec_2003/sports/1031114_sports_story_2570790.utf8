The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Italy go down 1-3 to Poland
Warsaw: Poland beat Euro 2004-bound Italy 3-1 on Wednesday in a friendly international overshadowed by a bombing in Iraq which killed at least 18 Italians  mostly military police  and nine Iraqis. Players held a minutes silence before the game as a mark of respect for the victims. From the kick-off, Italy looked shaky at the back as Poland put on the kind of attacking display lacking from their failed Euro 2004 qualifying campaign. The hosts scored from their first chance following a corner, defender Jacek Bak beating keeper Francesco Toldo from 15m after six minutes. Fellow defender Tomasz Klos made it 2-0 with a glancing header from a Jacek Krzynowek free-kick in the 18th minute. AS Romas Antonio Cassano hit back straight from the restart, rounding goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek to score on his Italy debut. Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni switched his central defence at half-time, bringing on Marco Materazzi and Massimo Oddo for Fabio Cannavaro and Giuseppe Pancaro but the Poles continued to threaten. As the game looked like it would fizzle out amid a wave of substitutions, Poland made it 3-1 after 85 minutes when Krzynowek netted after a shot had rebounded off the post.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

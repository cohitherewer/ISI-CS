The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Test of nerves for Roddick
 Roddicks temperament has improved, but remains untested New York: A thunderbolt serve, a peerless recent record and a celebrity girlfriend have turned Andy Roddick into the hottest property in American tennis. Yet the world No. 4 still requires a Grand Slam title to become the complete package. It sounds almost churlish to suggest this, but can the A-Rod handle the pressure? A win-loss record of 30-2 since the French Open, and a 20-1 return on North American hardcourts this summer, would indicate the question should remain strictly rhetorical. His partnership with coach Brad Gilbert, not to mention a high-profile relationship with singer and actress Mandy Moore, has seen Roddick blossom from a reckless dynamo into a mature, 20-year-old contender. His serve of 149 mph earlier this season equalled the world record speed, while he carries himself with great confidence and now understands how to manipulate different situations on court to his advantage. He has scooped three titles in his last four tournaments, including back-to-back Masters Series crowns at Montreal and Cincinnati. Moreover, he has the backing of many American fans who are eager for Roddick to assume the glorious mantle held by Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi down the years. Yet being the overwhelming favourite for a tournament such as the US Open does not sit comfortably with everyone. Roddicks temperament has improved significantly, but it remains untested at the end of a tight five-setter in a cauldron like Flushing Meadows. So, too, has his ability to go the distance at a Grand Slam event. At the Australian Open and Wimbledon this year, he fell at the most agonising stage of all  the semi-finals. How will those memories play on his mind in New York? I prefer to look forward, he says. Im also not into ifs and buts...Id like to think Ive improved as a player since the Australian Open. Im playing with confidence...I feel as though when I walk on court I will win. Hopefully it will continue. I need to regroup, calm down and get ready for a whole new tournament. It is true he has improved, in every department. Even his formidable serve has got better for he now mixes up the delivery. This weapon will be key in determining his progress at the Open.

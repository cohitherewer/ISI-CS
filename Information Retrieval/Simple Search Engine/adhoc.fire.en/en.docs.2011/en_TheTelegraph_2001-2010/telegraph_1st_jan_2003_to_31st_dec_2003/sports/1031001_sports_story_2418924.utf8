The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bopanna, Amritraj shown the door 
Tumkur: Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj crashed out of the $25,000 ATP Challenger meet here on Tuesday. Sixth seed Marcello Craca of Germany, the world No. 242, ousted Bopanna 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3) in a match lasting over two hours. An off-colour Amritraj, ranked 333, put up a disappointing show to go down 2-6, 3-6 to Briton Martin Lee. Much was expected of Bopanna, especially after his heart-warming performance in the Davis Cup tie against Holland in Zwolle. But the man with a Challenger title (Jakarta) under his belt failed to get his act together when it mattered most on Tuesday. Craca broke Bopanna, world No. 351, in the ninth game to pocket the first set easily. The Coorg lad returned the compliment in the second set to restore parity. Bopanna appeared uncomfortable with the bounce, the German adapting to the new court much quicker. There was no service-break in the decider, but Craca kept his nerve in the tie-breaker to advance.  other results Singles: Michal Tabara (Cze) bt Michael Lammer (Sui) 6-3, 6-1; Ota Fukarek (Cze) bt Dmitry Vlasov (Rus) 6-1, 6-4.

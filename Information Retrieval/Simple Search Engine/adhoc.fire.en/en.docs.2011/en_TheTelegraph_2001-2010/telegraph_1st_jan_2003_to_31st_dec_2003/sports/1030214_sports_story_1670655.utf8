The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warne claim rubbished by doctor
Sydney: Shane Warne cant use his mother as an excuse for taking a banned drug that could end his cricket career, Australian Medical Association president Kerryn Phelps said Thursday. After the news of Warne testing positive broke out Monday, the leg-spinner said his mother had given him the diuretic tablet, moduretic, which he swallowed the day before he returned from a shoulder injury to the one-day team last month. Phelps, however, rubbished the excuse as nonsense. Warne said he didnt take it as part of his shoulder treatment, so goodness knows what he was taking it for unless he had PMS (Premenstrual Stress), Phelps said. The Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) had a hotline open from 9am to 9pm on weekdays and 9am to 5pm on weekends and public holidays so that athletes could find out any drugs status before taking it, Phelps said. You cant use mum as an excuse because mum could call the hotline, she said. And parents of elite athletes who are even slightly tempted to give their offspring a tablet to take, ring the hotline and find out whether its okay. Because chances are theyre going to get tested, and if they test positive for a banned positive, they may well be banned from sport. Warnes case would be heard by Australian Cricket Boards anti-doping committee in Sydney Friday. Supreme Court justice Bill Gillard is expected to head the three-member panel to decide the fate of the leggie. Meanwhile the Warnes have appealed to the Australian media to leave his family alone. We understand there is a lot of public interest in this story, including Shane and our mum, Jason Warne, the players brother and manager, said.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

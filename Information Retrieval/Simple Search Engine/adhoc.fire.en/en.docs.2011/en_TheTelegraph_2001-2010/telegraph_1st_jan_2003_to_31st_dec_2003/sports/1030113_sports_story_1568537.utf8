		 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 India can win the Cup, feels Vengsarkar
				 	 Sachin: Should continue at No. 4																								Margao: Former skipper Dilip Vengsarkar Sunday said the current Indian team has the potential to win the World Cup.																								Vengsarkar, the BCCI talent resource development wing chairman, who was here to watch the Deodhar Trophy match between Central and East Zone, said the current side can stun the best team if it plays to potential in the World Cup.																								Commenting on the tour of New Zealand, he said the pitches there were heavily loaded in favour of pacers which is not good for cricket as we saw both the team struggling to cross the 200 mark. But conditions in South Africa will be different where the pitches will help both the batsmen and the bowlers.																								Its high time we prepare hard and bouncy pitches at home in domestic cricket which will help our players to adopt themselves on fast tracks and raise the level of our game and win more matches abroad, he said.																								He also said that Sachin Tendulkar should continue to bat at No. 4 during the quadrennial showpiece starting next month.																								I see no harm in his continuing at No 4. He bats at this spot even in the Test matches and since the team management needs him to play lower in the order, he should stick to that position. 																								Over the years people have been accustomed to watching Sachin belt memorable hundreds opening the innings. However, keeping the teams interest in mind, I think India will be well served to have Sachin at four just to have the psychological advantage, Vengsarkar said.																								He suggested Rahul Dravid should play at No. 3 and anchor the innings in the World Cup.																								Vengsarkar feels that Sachin continues to be an aggressive batsman. He has been playing cricket for last 15 years and changes are bound to happen. For me he is still aggressive and uses the weapon only when required.																								Currently, the maestro is at the peak of his career and has a good six to seven years of top class cricket left in him, he added. (AFP)

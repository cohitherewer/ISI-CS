The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shoaib achieves everything but hattrick
 Shoaib, happy after his six-wicket haul on Monday, rued missing hattrick 12 times Wellington: The Rawalpindi Express achieved everything he wanted to with his stunning spell against New Zealand on Monday... Except for the elusive hattrick. Shoaib Ahktar, who has made a habit of terrorising New Zealand batsmen, bowled Pakistan within sight of a series victory with another unplayable spell in the second Test at the Basin Reserve. His haul of six for 30 to spark a New Zealand collapse of seven wickets for just eight runs gave him match figures of 11 for 78. But for all his success, he regrets not snaring Craig McMillans wicket for his first international hattrick. It was brute of an in-swinging yorker which McMillan somehow kept out after Mark Richardson and Scott Styris had folded in the previous two balls. I always wish for it, and I have missed my hattrick about 12 times now. I try to make it happen. I was thinking it was my last chance for a while, said Akhtar. It wasnt a bad hattrick ball though, but he survived. I am just so unfortunate, I never get a hattrick. McMillan stays on the crease, so I thought the good ball would be a yorker. I am not lucky enough, but it will happen some day I hope. Akhtar looms as the dangerman for the upcoming one-day series, but was himself at a loss to explain his mastery of New Zealands batsmen. His not-so-secret weapon of the reverse swinging yorker again accounted for several batsmen in this Test. It seems like my favourite team doesnt it? he said.  Im really up for the Australians and all the tougher  sides. New Zealand have good batsmen and play fast bowlers  really well. I am very fortunate to get wickets against  them.  (AFP)  Copyright

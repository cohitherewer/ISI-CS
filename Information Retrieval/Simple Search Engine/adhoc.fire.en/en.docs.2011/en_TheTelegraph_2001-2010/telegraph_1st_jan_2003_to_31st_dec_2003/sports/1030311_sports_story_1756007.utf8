The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mendis enjoying advisers role
We didnt drop Jayawardene because we still regard him as a matchwinner  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Mendis: Wearing many hats Johannesburg: Captain. Manager. Coach. Chief selector... And, now, the first Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL)-appointed adviser. Its unlikely that anybody anywhere has worn as many hats as Duleep Mendis and, if you ask him, he is quite enjoying this latest role.When I took up the assignment, after our poor tour of England last year, Id made it clear I would stay till the World Cup. However, since then, I havent been told anything...In any case, I continue to be the BCCSLs director of development, Mendis told The Telegraph Monday morning.Talking about his newest responsibility, Mendis said: As the designation suggests, Im advising the team on all matters... I touch upon aspects like mental toughness as well... Its interesting, though not very different from the time I was coach...Given his position, Mendis does have a say (though informally) in the composition of the XI. Well, I do get consulted, is all he himself acknowledged, smiling.Agreeing that Sri Lanka have lacked consistency, Mendis felt Mahela Jayawardenes poor run  scores of 1, 5, 9, 1 and 0 going into the India game  had hit the team hard. We didnt drop him because its only by playing that he can come out of such a patch. Moreover, we still regard him a matchwinner.Forget being a matchwinner, Jayawardene added a duck at the Wanderers, Monday.  Copyright

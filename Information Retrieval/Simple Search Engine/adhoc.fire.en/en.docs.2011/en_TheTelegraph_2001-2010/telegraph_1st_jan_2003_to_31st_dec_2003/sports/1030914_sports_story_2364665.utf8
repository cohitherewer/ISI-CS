Coventry said Ravanelli, who played at Derby County for the last two seasons, had passed a medical and agreed terms but interest from Scottish side Dundee put the brakes on the Highfield Road deal. quot;Coventry City has withdrawn its interest in Fabrizio Ravanelli after talks with the former Italian international broke down, quot; said a club statement.

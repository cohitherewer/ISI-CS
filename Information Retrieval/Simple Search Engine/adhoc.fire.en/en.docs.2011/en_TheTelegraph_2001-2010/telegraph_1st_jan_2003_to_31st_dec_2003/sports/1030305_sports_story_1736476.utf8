The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Boucher in dark, not Jayasuriya
Durban: A dressing room goof-up of the victory target cost South Africa the crunch match against Sri Lanka and showed the exit door to the World Cup hosts in the league round itself. South African skipper Shaun Pollock, face twitched with despair and myriad other emotions, said here Monday Mark Boucher did not know that one more run was needed for victory. Boucher was given the message of 229. So he was pretty happy when he got that, Pollock said after the the rain-affected pool B match. Sri Lankan captain Sanath Jayasuriya, however, said there was no confusion in his camp regarding the target. We knew that 229 was for the tie. I had the sheet in my hand, he said, delighted with his teams progress to the next round. Jayasuriya also attributed the change in fortunes for his team to the time spent in South Africa and Australia before the World Cup. Everyone in the side knows the conditions. Thats a big help and thats why we are playing such good cricket. Meanwhile, BCCSL acting chief Jayantha Kudahetty said in Colombo that Jayasuriyas side can now go all the way. At the moment they are playing well and certainly they are capable of repeating the performance of 1996, Kudahetty said.  (PTI)  Copyright

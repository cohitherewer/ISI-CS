				 																																	London: Birmingham City striker Christophe Dugarry was fined  12,500 for spitting by the English Football Association on Friday.				 																																	The fine related to the Frenchmans clash with Aston Villas Joey Gudjonsson in the stormy midlands derby at Villa Park on March 3.				 																																	An FA disciplinary hearing found Dugarry guilty of improper conduct but accepted Dugarrys assertion that he did not deliberately spit at Gudjonsson.				 																																	While finding him guilty, the Commission accepted that he was not spitting directly at an opponent, the FA said in a statement on its official website. Dugarry, who was also warned about his future behaviour but avoided a possible three-match ban, has 14 days to appeal.Gudjonsson was one of two Villa players sent off in Birminghams 2-0 win at Villa Park. Striker Dion Dublin was also red-carded for head-butting Birminghams Robbie Savage.

Johl carded an identical two-under 70 on the two days of the competition.

Both missed Wednesdays 5-0 friendly win over Egypt.

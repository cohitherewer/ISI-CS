 Geet in final
Hyderabad, Nov. 22 (PTI): Seven-time world champion Geet Sethi brushed aside a spirited challenge of Englishman Paul Bennet to set up a title clash with another Englishman, Lee Lagan, who got the better of Ashok Shandilya in the semi-finals of the World Billiards Championship here on Saturday. Sethi won the first frame with a fluent break of 68 and showed his prowess at potting to take a major break of 148 and win the second frame. Continuing his form, he notched up a break of 91 to take the third frame but the Englishman won the fourth frame narrowing the margin. The Indian was off colour in the fifth frame as Bennet won with ease leaving his opponent at 47. Sethi roared back to form with an unfinished break of 150 to take a comfortable 4-2 lead. Earlier, Shandilya went down fighting to Lagan in a thrilling encounter which stretched to its full extent. The two cueists took a frame each and were level at 4-4. In the decider Lagan took an unfinished break of 152 to enter the final.  Copyright

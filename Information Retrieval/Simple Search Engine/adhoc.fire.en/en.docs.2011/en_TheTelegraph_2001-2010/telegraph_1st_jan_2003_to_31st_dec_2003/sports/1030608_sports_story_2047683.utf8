 Silver for Gitika, Gurbinder
New Delhi, June 7 (PTI): Indias Gurbinder Singh and Gitika Jakhar had to settle for silver as defending champions Iran reigned with four golds on the penultimate day of the 16th Asian wrestling championship here Saturday. Kripa Shankar and Kamini Yadav won bronze in their respective categories. India, thus, extended their medals tally to four. Gurbinder could not withstand the challenge from Irans Zeid Vand Pariviz, a Busan bronze medallist and gold medallist of Asian championship-2000, and lost 1-8 in the final of 66 kg Greco-Roman category. The strong Irani showed some good technique, leading Gurbinder throughout before relaxing towards the end when the Indian scored his sole point. While Pariviz seemed unaffected by his bleeding ear, Gurbinders coach said the Indian grapplers performance was affected due to a shoulder pain.  Copyright

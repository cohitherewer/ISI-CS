The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Duo told to drop protest or face axe
Bulawayo: Andy Flower and Henry Olonga were warned Saturday to drop their black armband protest or face being axed from Zimbabwes Cup squad. The two were called separately to attend a special meeting of Zimbabwe Cricket Union executive board and emerged grim-faced after being told to abandon their protest. Olonga and Flower wore black armbands in their game against Namibia and issued a powerfully-worded statement condemning the regime of president Robert Mugabe. Against India, the duo donned black wristbands. Although Saturdays ZCU ultimatum was not from the disciplinary committee, it is understood that both men were warned to cease their protest in Mondays match against Australia in Bulawayo. Rain threat Meanwhile, heavy rain left large pools of water on the Queens Sports Club ground here two days ahead of the Zimbabwe-Australia match. Australia are due to fly in Sunday and will leave soon after the match. (AFP)  Copyright

 Dravids Scot hopes
Edinburgh: Rahul Dravid said on Tuesday he hopes to play with the Scottish Saltires for another season. The 30-year-old Indian joined the National League team earlier this year and has scored three centuries and two half-centuries in nine games. All things considered, if its possible, I would definitely like to come back next year, Dravid told BBCs Asian Network. Everyone has been very friendly and made me feel welcome.  (AP)  Copyright

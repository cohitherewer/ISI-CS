		 Friday, August 22, 2003  Fond Fantasy may be hard to toss 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL		 PrakashMysore: It is hard to look beyond Fond Fantasy in the 10-horse field of the 1,400m Nanoli Stud Million, the star attraction of Fridays races.				 										The Razeen-Excentrique filly is the winner of the fillies classic and had also occupied the runner-up slot in the Derby during the Bangalore summer season. The Robert Foley-trainee, is, apparently, in great form and she may triumph in the trusted hands of jockey B. Prakash.				 										SELECTIONS				 										1.45 pm: Towering Success 1.

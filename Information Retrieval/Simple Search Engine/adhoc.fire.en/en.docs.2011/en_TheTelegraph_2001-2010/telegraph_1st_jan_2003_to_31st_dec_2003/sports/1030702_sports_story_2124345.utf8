 Hashan worried over batting
Kingston: Sri Lankan captain Hashan Tillekeratne isnt really worried about their loss to West Indies in the recently concluded Test series. The Lankans went down at Sabina Park in less than three days ensuring their fourth straight series defeat on tour. Sri Lanka havent won a series abroad since their triumph in Pakistan in March 2000. The captain believes batting has really been the area of concern. Our batting is very brittle, we need to improve significantly if we are going to be competitive away from home. The batsmen really failed to play to their potential here. Everyone is banking on me to get runs and the team has struggled as a result, he said. (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pole for Barrichello
Sao Paulo, April 5 (Reuters): Ferraris Rubens Barrichello will start his home Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix on pole position for the first time on Sunday. After eight years of failure at Interlagos, the local favourite delighted the fans with a lap of one minute 13.807 seconds. He is the first Brazilian to qualify on pole at home since the late Ayrton Senna in 1994. Briton David Coulthard will join Barrichello on the front row for McLaren. Australian Mark Webber was third while Michael Schumacher was only seventh fastest.  Copyright

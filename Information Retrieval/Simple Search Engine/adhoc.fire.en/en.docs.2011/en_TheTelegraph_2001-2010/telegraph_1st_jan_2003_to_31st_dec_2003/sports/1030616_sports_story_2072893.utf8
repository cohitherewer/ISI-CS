 Ivanisevic, Seles pull out of Big W
 Monica Seles has a nagging foot injury London: Former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic has withdrawn from the grasscourt Grand Slam with a knee injury, organisers said on Sunday. The 2001 mens champion picked up the injury while practising with fellow Croat Mario Ancic earlier this week. Former womens world number one Monica Seles, runner-up at the All England Club to Steffi Graf in 1992, has also withdrawn due to a nagging foot problem. Ivanisevic has struggled with injuries since becoming the first wildcard to triumph at Wimbledon two years ago. A shoulder problem prevented him from defending his title 12 months ago but the 31-year-old was attempting to make a comeback this year by playing in the Stella Artois Championships in the run up to the third major of the year. But after suffering a first round loss at Queens Club, the Croat raised doubts about his Wimbledon prospects as he was unhappy with his level of fitness. However, his latest injury put paid to his hopes of returning to Wimbledon, which starts in eight days.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

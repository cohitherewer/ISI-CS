The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak aim to wrap up 2nd Test quickly
 Yasir Hameed is confident of repeating the Karachi show Peshawar: Pakistan are looking to wrap up the second Test against Bangladesh which starts on Wednesday inside four days despite the hot and humid conditions here. Pakistan won the first Test in Karachi on Sunday by seven wickets but had to bat twice and were stretched to the second session on the final day. In Karachi the pitch was very slow and it suited the Bangladesh team. Our batting also didnt click in the first innings, Pakistan coach Javed Miandad said on Tuesday. But the pitch conditions here are more suited for the bowlers and we will try to force a result as soon as possible. Karachis match was Pakistans fourth straight win over Bangladesh. It was also the first time since 2001 that Bangladesh took a Test into the fifth day. Pakistan are unlikely to make any change to its winning combination against Bangladesh. We have not decided as yet. But the hot conditions will test the bowlers. We need to bat first and get a big first innings total, Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said. Pakistan played their first Test in Karachi since losing to South Africa at the Centurion last January. The Test in Peshawar will also be significant for Pakistans newcomer Yasir Hameed who scored a record-equalling two hundreds in the first Test against Bangladesh. Hameed, whose two centuries made him only the second player in Test history after West Indian Lawrence Rowe to get two tons on his debut, is playing in his hometown. But the 25-year-old who stroked his way to 170 and 105 in Karachi said he was not feeling any pressure playing in his birth place and would try to repeat his Karachi performance in Peshawar. I know the expectations are high from my people but I am feeling very confident after Karachi and I am capable of handling this extra pressure, Hameed added. Hameed has been the focus of attention since arriving here on Monday morning because his late father was a reputed and respected lawyer in the city. His coach believes he has the confidence and ability to score another hundred against Bangladesh, due to play a total of three Tests and five one-day matches during their tour of Pakistan. A Test match is being played at the Arbab Niaz stadium for the first time since March 2000 when Sri Lanka beat the home side.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

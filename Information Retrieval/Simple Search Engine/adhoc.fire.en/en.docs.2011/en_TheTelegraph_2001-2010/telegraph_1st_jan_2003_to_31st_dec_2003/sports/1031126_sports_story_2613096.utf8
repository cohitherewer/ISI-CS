 Lanka A in grim battle
Ahmedabad: Skipper Naveed Nawazs hit an unbeaten 72 as Sri Lanka A fought a grim battle to set a challenging target for India A on the penultimate day of the four-day match at the Motera on Tuesday. After conceding a first innings lead of 125, the Islanders were precariously placed at 196 for four at close of play. The visitors lead by a mere 76 runs and with no specialist batsmen to come next, the onus is on Nawaz and T. Kandamby, on 16, to pose a daunting total. Earlier, Lankan left-arm spinner C. Herath removed three Indian tailenders to restrict the hosts to 369, but not before overnight batsman Ramesh Powar scored a vital 42. Wicketkeeper-batsman P. Jayawardene scored 76, as Sri Lanka began their second innings, but was bowled by Powar, He put on 94 with Nawaz. Gujarat pacer Munaf Patel and Siddharth Trivedi struck in quick succession to remove Ian Daniel and Jehan Mubarak, respectively. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, November 13, 2003  Red Chief may lift Hilliard Cup 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 Daniel				 										Calcutta: Red Chief and Striesand, the two classy outstation youngsters, will cross swords in Thursdays main event, the 1,400m Hilliard Cup. However, the track record of the former, a Daniel David-trainee, appears to be impressive compared to the Bharath Singh ward. The Razeen-Rhein Jewel son boasts of having finished second in the monsoon version of both, the Hyderabad Derby and the Colts Stakes. Although, the Chief would be at a slight disadvantage over the slated trip against sprint specialist Striesand, his superior class may help him score in the hands of Amyn Merchant.				 										However, Bharaths Followme, in the 1,600m Wiseman Cup, may be hard to toss. Rated as good as Brighter Future, who steam-rolled a Class III opposition last Friday, the Batzushka-Fusion daughter may not be hard-pressed to beat her Class IV rivals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Yuvraj, Chopra set to make XIV 
 - 1st test - Parthiv expected to keep berth  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Yuvraj Singh Rajkot: Yuvraj Singh, who has been playing  ODIs for exactly three years, and rookie opener Akash Chopra  are strongly placed to make the Team India XIV for the  first Test against New Zealand, in Ahmedabad from next Wednesday. According to The Telegraphs sources, Chopra  who posted a superb unbeaten 103 in the tourists opening match (Board Presidents XI, Vizag)  is being seen as Virender Sehwags partner at the very top of the order. As for Yuvraj, most feel he must be in the squad even if he cant get a first XI berth. Incidentally, Yuvraj authored an unbeaten 80 in Vizag. The national selectors, with Syed Kirmani in the chair, will be meeting here on Saturday afternoon. Of course, Norths Kirti Azad may not attend owing to urgent work in his Lok Sabha constituency. Its also not clear whether Sourav Ganguly  retained captain for the two Tests versus New Zealand and the tri-series at home  will make it. Coach John Wright, though, is already in town and was busy making notes on Day-I of the three-dayer at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground. The combination, so to say, should be finalised by late on Friday and it will be interesting how the new chief selector, Kirmani, plays his cards. Thursday marked his first (formal) day in office and he spent much time interacting with Pranab Roy (East), Kiran More (West) and Sanjay Jagdale (Central). Meanwhile, Deep Dasgupta didnt do his comeback-cause any harm in the match being played here  in fact, he took an excellent leg-side catch off Munaf Musa Patels bowling  but only a really big innings will make him a hot contender for the big gloves in the very near future. Moreover, Deep will have to continue being very tidy behind the wickets. As a top source put it: Look, by picking him for India A, the selectors have sent a strong message  basically, that he hasnt been forgotten. Now, Deep must consistently show that he deserves to be in the selectors sights... At the moment, young Parthiv Patel appears set to retain the wicketkeepers slot.  Copyright

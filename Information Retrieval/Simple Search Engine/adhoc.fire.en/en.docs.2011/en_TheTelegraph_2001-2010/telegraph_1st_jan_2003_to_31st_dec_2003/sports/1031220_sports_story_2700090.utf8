The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sri Lanka cruise on second day
 - Hosts home in on Englands first innings total  Jayasuriya sends one to the boundary during his knock of 85 versus England in Colombo on Friday. (Reuters) Colombo: Sanath Jayasuriya posted his highest score in 16 months as Sri Lanka closed in on Englands modest first innings total of 265 on the second day of the deciding third and final Test on Friday. The home team reached 264 for two at the close after Jayasuriya clubbed 12 fours and a six in his 85 off 104 balls. Trailing England by just one run, Sri Lanka are well placed to secure a big lead when play resumes on Saturday. Thilan Samaraweera and Mahela Jayawardene also toyed with the English attack to score half-centuries. Samaraweera was unbeaten on 68 with Jayawardene on 60. Jayasuriya put on 71 for the first wicket with Kumar Sangakkara and 67 for the second with Samaraweera. Samaraweera added 126 with Jayawardene in their yet unbroken third-wicket stand. Jayasuriya and Sangakkara, who opened in place of the injured Maravan Atapattu, had taken the attack to Englands bowlers in the morning in a run-a-ball stand before James Kirtley broke through just before lunch. Having stroked six boundaries in a stylish cameo, Sangakkara was caught at slip by Trescothick after edging a well-disguised slower ball. Jayasuriya got a life on 38 when Graham Thorpe failed to hold on to a one-handed catch at gully off Andrew Flintoff, who bowled a tight spell. Jayasuriya, who reached his 50 just before lunch, settled down after the break. But within sight of his first century since the 145 against Bangladesh in July 2002, the 34-year-old left-hander edged Flintoff to Trescothick at slip. England added just six to their overnight total in the morning before Chaminda Vaas trapped James Kirtley and James Anderson leg-before to wrap up the innings. Vaas finished with three for 64 and Muttiah Muralidharan three for 40 from 40 overs, which took his series tally to 23 wickets. The first two Tests were drawn.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

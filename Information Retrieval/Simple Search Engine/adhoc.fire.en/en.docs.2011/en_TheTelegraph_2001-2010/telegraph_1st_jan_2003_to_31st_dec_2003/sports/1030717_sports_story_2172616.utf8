London: Fine centuries by Gautam Gambhir, Sridharan Sriram and Ambati Rayudu put India A in the drivers seat against Surrey on Day II of the three-day match at The AMP Oval here on Wednesday. Replying to Surreys first innings 173, India A declared at 462 for four after tea. Gambhir and Rayudu were then batting on 130 and 101, respectively, after Sriram made 115. Surrey were 39 for no loss at stumps in their second innings With Scott Newman batting on six and Jonathan Batty on 27. It was Gambhirs second ton on tour after his 128 not out against British Universities on June 25. Resuming from their overnight score of 235 for two, the tourists sent Surrey on a long leather hunt batting through to the last session losing just two more wickets.  (PTI)  Copyright

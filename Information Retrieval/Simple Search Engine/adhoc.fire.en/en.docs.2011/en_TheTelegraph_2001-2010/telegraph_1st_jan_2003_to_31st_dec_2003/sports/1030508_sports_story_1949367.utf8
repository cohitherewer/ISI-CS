 Arantxas memories
Berlin: Former world number one Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario revived fond German Open memories on Wednesday when she paid a visit to a tournament she played 12 times and won in 1995. Its good to be back here, said the Spaniard, appearing at a WTA Tour event for the first time since announcing her retirement last November. I havent been doing very much, added the 31-year-old, who won 29 singles titles including four Grand Slams in a career spanning over 15 years. I decided to take a year off and enjoy myself doing things I didnt have time to do when I was playing, like skiing and horse riding.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

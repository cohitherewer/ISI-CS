The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Finally, a touch of romance
 We knew Australia were ruthless, but  were just finding out about India BY MARK NICHOLAS IN BLOEMFONTEIN The aggressive Aussies  celebrate the fall of another New Zealand wicket on  Tuesday. (AP/PTI)  These have been the most revealing  days of the World Cup. The presence of Kenya and Zimbabwe  as surprise Super Sixers seemed to compromise the showpiece  end of the tournament, but now Kenya have brought romance  to an event which was rapidly losing its appeal. Their achievement of securing  a place in the semi-finals is remarkable, given the limited  talent available and the fact that the game is run by Asians  and played mainly by Africans. Given the colonial history  of Africa this is not surprising, but it does illustrate  the difficulties of broadening the games base and sustaining  its growth. It would be nice to think that  there would be parties on the streets of Nairobi tonight,  but cricket has not caught on in the popular sense. The  International Cricket Council missed a trick three years  ago when the Champions Trophy, as it is now known, was staged  in Nairobi.  There was no coverage on Kenyan  television and ticket prices were absurdly high. If the  game is to be properly developed, the ICC will have to do  some underwriting otherwise Steve Tikolo and Maurice Odumbe,  two of crickets finest, will still be turning out with  their children, never mind their brothers. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, crowds  are sparse when they play for the public have not appreciated  the distorted manner of their qualification. The West Indies  should be here still and if South Africa were too, the party  spirit would have continued. Some South Africans have switched  their allegiance to the Kenyans, talking of them as we  and us. Others are now backing India, which nicely sets  up the Durban day-night semi-final. There are a million  Indians in Natal alone and playing at Kingsmead is usually  like playing at home. This occasion was sold out months  ago so the tribal fervour should, at least, make for a jolly  night. Momentum can be an irresistible  force and since their humiliation against Australia a month  ago, Sourav Gangulys Indian side have won six times consecutively. They are rapidly becoming one  of Indias best teams. Mondays demolition job on Sri Lanka  was even more profound in its way than the one done on the  same opponents by the Australians last Friday. We knew Australia  were ruthless, but we are just finding out about India.  With a bit of luck these two countries will contest the  final on a sunny day and a true Wanderers pitch.  The tournament needs something  uncomplicated like that. It appears India are the only  team who could conceivably beat Australia, and even that  is a long shot. On pitches in Port Elizabeth that in no  way suit Australias all-out, aggressive style, both England  and New Zealand had them in the coffin but could not find  the nails.  No one would expect opponents  to escape from the desperate position in which the Aussies  found themselves on Tuesday, yet Shane Bond took six for  23 and lost. For all the talent, Australia are a champion  team because of the strength of characters who never give  in and, as they would admit if they were honest, dont believe  that anyone else is fit to lick their boots anyway. They  are right. There is an off day to come but it does not look  as though it will be here. On Saturday Kenya get their chance  to go up against the best and they will be amazed by the  ferocity and intensity that greets them. Steve Tikolo, the  captain, has made noises about his team deserving Test status.  Going head to head with these Aussies might lead him to  rethink. Having said that, the Kenyans  are under no illusions about the true reasons for their  place in the Super Six  rain in Benoni, New Zealands fears  of playing in Nairobi, and Collins Obuyas leg spin against  a shambolic Sri Lanka.  But they have upset big names  before, notably the West Indies in the 1996 World Cup and  India during a triangular tournament in South Africa last  year. Bangladesh have managed this only once, and that in  the dubiously motivated match against Pakistan at Northampton  in the last World Cup. Now Kenya have utterly outplayed  Zimbabwe in a do-or-die situation, which brings them great  credit. Three full member nations have fallen at their feet  in this tournament, so Tikolo has a point when making comparisons.  The truth, of course, is that neither Bangladesh nor Kenya  should have Test status. Test cricket is another game and  one which cannot afford to be undervalued. THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Copyright

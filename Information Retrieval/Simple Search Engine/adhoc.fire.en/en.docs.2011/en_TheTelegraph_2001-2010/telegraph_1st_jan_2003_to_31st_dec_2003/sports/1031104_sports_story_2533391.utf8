The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Conditional release of World Cup money
London: The International Cricket Council has confirmed that it would release the World Cup money withheld by it from India and some other countries but only when a series of strict conditions are met. The ICC said in a statement from Barbados, West Indies, where a two-day meeting of its executive board was held last weekend, that member countries would have to comply with specific conditions before they can access the withheld money. [Irrespective of the ICCs official position, The Telegraph understands that all ten Test playing nations will share the burden equally in case crickets governing body is obliged to honour claims made by the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC).] These conditions will include, the ICCs independent auditors and lawyers agreeing that the release of any money is a prudent and appropriate action and the independent advisors agreeing to the appropriate amount of money, if any, that should be released, the statement said. The games world governing body said any member country wishing to access any money that is freed after the professional advice must give an unconditional and irrevocable legal undertaking which may take the form of a bank guarantee, to pay back the money if required by ICC. The mechanism proposed ensures that each member is obliged to give the same undertakings in order to access their money. These undertakings are comprehensive, unconditional and as good as cash in the bank. If these can be met, the money can be released, ICC president Ehsan Mani said in the statement. Indias World Cup guarantee money amounting to $ 6.5 million has been withheld by the ICC.  (PTI)  Copyright

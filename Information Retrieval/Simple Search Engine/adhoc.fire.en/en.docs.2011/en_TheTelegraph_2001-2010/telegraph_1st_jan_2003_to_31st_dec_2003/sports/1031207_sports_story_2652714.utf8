The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Williams warned for criticising selectors
		 Williams has apologised for his remarksBrisbane, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Australia fast bowler Brad Williams has been warned for publicly criticising the national selectors after he was dropped for the first Test against India. Williams made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in October but was demoted to 12th man for the opening Test against India after the selectors opted for uncapped left-arm paceman Nathan Bracken. Williams was later released from the squad to be able to play in a domestic first-class match in Perth but told reporters there that he had been dumped because he was a right-arm bowler. I just bowl with the wrong arm, mate, that is about it, he said. It is pretty hard to swallow when they havent had a left-armer for so long. Williams complaint drew a sharp rebuke from Cricket Australia. He was immediately warned about his comments, although no further punishment was meted out. Williams immediately issued a statement apologising for his comments. I certainly regret any offence that might have been taken from the comment, he said.  Copyright

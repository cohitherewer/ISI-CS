The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its his body and his life: Sourav
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  SRINATH: Mind almost made up On board AI 5224 to Mumbai: Jawagal Srinaths mind appears to have been made up on quitting all forms of international cricket and, this time, captain Sourav Ganguly may not request the senior pro to have a rethink. Late last year, Sourav (and chief selector Brijesh Patel), it may be recalled, persuaded Srinath to make himself available for Test cricket after he announced that his focus would be ODIs only. Its his body, its his life, Sourav told The Telegraph, Tuesday, when asked if he would again speak to the 33-year-old. Of course, the captain didnt specifically say he wouldnt, but more than indicated he had no plans to influence Srinath. Indeed, Sourav added : After so many years, playing or not playing is a personal thing... Srinath has been on India-duty from late 1991. Dhaka tournament Meanwhile, with South Africa pulling out of next months tri-series in Sharjah, theres also a question mark over the Graeme Smith-led teams participation in the three-nation meet in Bangladesh. In any case, its likely that some of our top players will make themselves unavailable. In fact, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ought never to have agreed to participate and, clearly, the brass wont be unhappy if the South Africans decide to stay at home. After all, the tournament will then have to be cancelled. Even if the meet is held, in mid-April, there will be a complete break for our players till mid-August  thats when the much-delayed Asia Cup is scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka.  Copyright

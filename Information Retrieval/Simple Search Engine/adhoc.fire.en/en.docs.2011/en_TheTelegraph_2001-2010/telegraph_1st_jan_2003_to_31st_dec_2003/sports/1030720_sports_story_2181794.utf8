The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Greg Chappell principles
- Australian legend acknowledges being influenced by Einstein, Newton  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Greg Chappell advocates unstructured learning Calcutta, July 19: Few, perhaps, remember that Greg Chappell was a contender for the Team India coachs job. As it turned out, the Board eventually decided on John Wright who wears his low profile on both sleeves.That, of course, was almost three years ago. More recently, Greg was in India and made a remarkable presentation  a copy of which is with The Telegraph  during the MRF Coaches Seminar in Chennai. The former Australia captain (and idol of generations) spoke both on coaching and batting.One understands the invitees  including Wright and Ashok Malhotra, stand-in Team India coach for a brief while earlier this year  were all ears during his nearly three-hour presentation over two days.Actually, they couldnt but have taken in every word, specially when Greg talked of the principles which formulated the envied Chappell way.Among other things, Greg acknowledged being influenced by Albert Einstein (theory of relativity), Isaac Newton (laws of motion) and Professor Nicholas Negroponte (an advocate of unstructured approach to learning).[Negroponte is the Wiesner Professor of media technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and best-selling author of Being Digital. That 1995 book, by the way, has been translated into 40 languages.]With such inspiration, its hardly a surprise that Greg was himself such a scientist among batsmen  totalling a masterly 7,110 runs in Tests (24 hundreds, average 53-plus) and 2,331 in ODIs (three hundreds, average 40-plus).Describing cricket as a sport which reflects the ups and downs of life, Greg called for a shift towards unstructured learning. Basically, he wants youngsters to have a free run in other disciplines as well.Significantly, Greg pointed out that learning is far more efficient when the person is encouraged to develop solutions to problems Its important to provide a wide range of situational learningsIn Gregs opinion, many hours of unstructured play and minimal formal competitive pressures will go a long way in building a cricketer. Incidentally, for Greg, the real crux of coaching is best explained by a quote that has stood the test of time: Any life can be damaged by the wrong words from the right persons lips. Conversely, any life can be healed by the right words from the right persons lips. Each of our lives has been touched by the presence of one individual who made a tremendous difference.That individual may have trusted you when others doubted, backed you when others backed away, saw deeper into your soul than you ever imagined possible. That person provided a kind word at a critical moment, an encouraging smile, or an arm around the shoulder.Its reasonable to assume that those who heard Greg left with much to think about. And implement.

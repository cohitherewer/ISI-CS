The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav downplays Bond factor
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Sourav Ganguly at a function in Bangalore  on Wednesday. (PTI)Bangalore: Im not thinking too much about the New Zealand squad...Its more important to look at ourselves...In any case, I dont think Shane Bond would have been a big factor, is how Team India captain Sourav Ganguly reacted, when asked by The Telegraph to comment on the Black Caps line-up for the forthcoming series. While the super fast Bond, who is injured, hasnt been named in either the Test or tri-series (where Australia will be the third team) squad, key allrounder Chris Cairns will miss the two Tests (Ahmedabad and Mohali) only. I guess the furore would only be in India, Sourav quipped, when it was pointed out that Cairns wasnt available for the first half of the tour as his wife is expecting their second child. Moreover, picking and choosing  for one reason or the other  isnt something new for Cairns. Sourav, however, isnt surprised that Craig McMillan has been recalled. Hes a good player of spin...Therefore, I expected him to be there, he said. What the captain didnt say is that beating New Zealand is an absolute priority for him  only a resounding win will help erase memories of the thrashing received from Stephen Fleming and Co. last December-January. Meanwhile, Sourav (as also Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble) were honoured by the Karnataka government on Wednesday afternoon.  Copyright

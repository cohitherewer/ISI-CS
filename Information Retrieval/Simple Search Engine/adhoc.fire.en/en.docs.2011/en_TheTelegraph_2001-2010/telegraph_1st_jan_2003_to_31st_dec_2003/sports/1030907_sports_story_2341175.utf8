The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Bengal leaving nothing to chance
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 		 Musah will replace DouglasCalcutta, Sept. 6: The CFL Super Division championship is there for East Bengals taking. They have the bench-strength to sail through the home stretch and scotch Mohun Bagans hopes of forcing a play-off for the title. But Subhas Bhowmick is not taking anything for granted. We have a tough match coming up, the coach said on the eve of East Bengals clash with a team (Mohammedan Sporting) they had thrashed 4-1 in the first phase. They have been pushed to a corner and will try their hardest to salvage some pride. We have to be patient as they will, in all likelihood, be defensive to start with. Having drawn with Mohun Bagan the other day, East Bengal need to ensure they dont drop more than two points in their remaining four games (including Sundays). Bhowmick refuses to be drawn into any such calculation and would rather win all those matches. He was criticised in some quarters for not fielding Suley Musah against Mohun Bagan, but has been spared another sensitive selection problem following Douglas da Silvas ill health. The Brazilian, down with high temperature, is ruled out for Sundays duel, and will be replaced in the starting XI by Musah. The captain is expected to form a three-pronged forward line with Mike Okoro and Bijen Singh. The midfield will be manned by Malsawmtluanga, Dipankar Roy, Sur Kumar Singh and Debjit Ghoshs replacement Chandan Das. Replacing Dipak Mondal  who along with Debjit will have to sit out Sundays match after being red-carded two days ago  will be Subhashish Roy Chowdhury. There is little spirit left in the Mohammedan Sporting camp after having been denied victory in their last six matches. There is not much at stake, but well have to try and end this barren run, was all that coach Mohammed Habeeb would say after the morning practice session. He added that as many as nine players in his team have some injury or the other and observed that he doesnt have an enviable bench-strength like East Bengals. Technical adviser P.K. Banerjee had two things to suggest to Dipendu Biswas amp; Co: get the basics right and concentrate hard.  Copyright

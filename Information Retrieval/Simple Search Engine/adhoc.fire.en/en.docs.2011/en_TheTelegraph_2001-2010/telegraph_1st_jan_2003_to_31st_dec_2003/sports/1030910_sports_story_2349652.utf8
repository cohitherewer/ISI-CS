		 Wednesday, September 10, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Bogota: Disillusioned Colombia striker Victor Aristizabal, dropped for the World Cup qualifier against Brazil at the weekend, has announced he is retiring from international soccer. Aristizabal, the highest-scoring foreigner in the Brazilian league with Cruzeiro, was visibly upset when he made his announcement on Monday after he had been overlooked by coach Pacho Maturana for Sundays qualifier in Barranquilla.				 																																	Colombia were beaten 2-1 by the world champions in their opening South American qualifier for the 2006 finals.				 																																	Maturana said he did not think Aristizabal was fit to play but the striker said in Bolivia where Colombia play their second qualifier on Wednesday: I was ready, I came from Brazil to play, I was happy, motivated, Im in great form. I couldnt understand why I didnt play. This is a tough moment for me, so thats why I think this match against Bolivia will be my last with the national team. 				 																																	Beijing: Indias medal chances suffered a setback after an agonising 1-3 defeat against Japan in the 12th Asian mens volleyball meet being played in Tianjin. India would now have to defeat the formidable Iran in order to remain in the medal hunt.				 																																	The Indians, who had won all their three matches in the preliminary league, made their superior opponents fight for every point but committed some unforced errors to lose the second-round round robin tie 22-25, 21-25, 25-23, 21-25 on Monday.				 																																	Buenos Aires: An Argentine judge has ordered all league games in Buenos Aires to be suspended for 15 days following crowd violence nine days ago in which some 70 people were hurt.				 																																	The order to be implemented from Tuesday followed a court ruling on Monday prohibiting the Federal Police, which operates in the capital, from policing matches organised by the Argentine Football Association.				 																																	 quot;For the duration of 15 consecutive days as from Tuesday, September 9, 2003 the Federal Police must abstain from taking part in any activity linked to the organisation and security of matches organised by the Argentine Football Association, quot; the ruling said.				 																																	Buenos Aires clubs Boca Juniors, the South American champions, and Chacarita Juniors blamed quot;non-existent quot; police security last week for the rioting at their August 31 match at Bocas Bombonera stadium.				 																																	London: Pakistans spin wizard Mushtaq Ahmed moved to within one wicket of the magical 100 for the season on Monday as he inspired Sussex to a seven-wicket victory over Middlesex and edged them closer to their first county championship title.				 																																	Mushtaq ended the match with ten for 225, including the final three Middlesex wickets in Mondays second innings before a half-century from Richard Montgomerie saw Sussex home after losing two early wickets and hold an 18 point lead over nearest rivals Surrey. 				 																																	Mushtaq said that the only way Sussex could miss out was if they lost their nerve in their final two matches from which they require just 10 points to make sure they are crowned 				 																																	champions. quot;It is in our own hands - we are in pole position now, quot; he said.  Sydney: Australian athletes, faced with  an upsurge in positive drug tests, were warned on Tuesday  the world anti-doping code would be strictly enforced ahead  of next years Athens Olympics.				 																																	Australian Sports Minister Rod Kemp issued the warning following what the federal opposition described as an alarming rise in the countrys athletes caught using banned drugs.  Kemp said the rise in positive results could  be attributed to improved testing procedures by the government-funded  Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA).

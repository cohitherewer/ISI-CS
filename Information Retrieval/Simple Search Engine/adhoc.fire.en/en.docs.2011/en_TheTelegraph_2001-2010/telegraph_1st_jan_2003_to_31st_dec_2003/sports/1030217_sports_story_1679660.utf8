 Kenya to demand points from NZ tie
Nairobi: Kenyan cricket chiefs will demand the points from their pool B match against New Zealand, which their opponents want switched to South Africa because of security concerns. New Zealand have asked for the game on February 21 to be moved from Nairobi as they are worried about the teams safety. As far as we are concerned, we simply want our four points. There should be no question of moving the match to another venue, Sharad Ghai, chairman of the World Cup Organising Committee in Kenya, said on Sunday. We have upgraded the security to befit any visiting head of state, including the American President. All this has been confirmed by the security agency advising the ICC. It may be recalled that, with the England imbroglio sorted out, the ICC has set out to attend to New Zealands plea to move their match out of Kenya. NZC reconfirmed its decision, taken prior to the start of the tournament, that it would not travel to Kenya because of safety and security concerns, the ICC said in a statement. The New Zealand submission details its security concerns, including the report of the NZCs independent security consultant, Mr Reg Dickason on safety in Kenya The NZC is also seeking clarification on the appropriate process through which to deal with this issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Decision on Warne today 
 Warne: Suspense lingers Sydney: Drug-tainted leg-spinner Shane Warnes career hung in the balance after the Australian Cricket Board adjourned till Saturday its hearing on the cricketers doping charges. The three-member panel  including Justice Glen Williams of the Queensland state Court of Appeal, former Test off-spinner Peter Taylor and medical specialist Susan White  was expected to continue its deliberations in Melbourne overnight and deliver its verdict at 11.00 the next morning. They will consider their position overnight and hope to be in a position to issue a determination here tomorrow, said an ACB spokesperson. Warne, Australias highest wicket-taker, tested positive for diuretics ahead of the World Cup and returned home from South Africa without playing a match. The 33-year-old bowler, who had already announced his retirement from one-day Internationals, faces a two-year ban, which is likely to put an end to his Test career too. The ACB has charged Warne with using a prohibited method, rather than a prohibited substance. Warne made an amazingly fast recovery from a shoulder injury he sustained during a one-day International against England last December. After being ruled out for at least six-weeks, he returned to domestic action in mid-January in the lead-up to the World Cup. Warne claimed he took a slim-down tablet given by his mother Brigitte on the day his urine samples were collected, and that he was not aware of its ingredients. (PTI)  Copyright

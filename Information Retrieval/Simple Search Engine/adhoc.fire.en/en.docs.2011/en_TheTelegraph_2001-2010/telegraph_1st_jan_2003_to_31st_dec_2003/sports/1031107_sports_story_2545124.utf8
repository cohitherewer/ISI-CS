 PCB offers NZC revised timings
Islamabad: Pakistan want to ensure New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming does not get a chance to complain as far as playing conditions and match timings are concerned. With New Zealands tour of Pakistan set to start in late November, the PCB has realised that the acute dew problem in Punjab province and the holy month of Ramazan could make it inconvenient for the visitors. Henceforth, the PCB has asked the ICC and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) to approve the hosting of day-night matches under a new time schedule, according to media reports. It is understood that the PCB is awaiting the ICC and NZC clearance for an early start to the four day and night matches in Rawalpindi and Lahore. The matches could begin at 11 am and extend to 7 pm. The PCB has also proposed the traditional break of 45 minutes between innings around 2.30 pm and an extended drinks break of 15 to 20 minutes in the second innings to include the Iftar time in Punjab for the two matches scheduled in Rawalpindi during Ramazan. The PCB has proposed the same timings for the two matches in Lahore after Ramazan but with no extended drinks break. If the ICC or NZC does not agree, the PCB might consider more day matches.

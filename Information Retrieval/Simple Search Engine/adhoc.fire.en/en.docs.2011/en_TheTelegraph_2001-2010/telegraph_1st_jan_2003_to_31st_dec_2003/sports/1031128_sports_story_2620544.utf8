The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Anchors role awaits Steve
 - Lectures, frequent appearances in India figure prominently in Aussie Test skippers post-retirement plans  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  A file picture of Steve Waugh with wife Lynette during their last visit to Calcutta  Calcutta: Even as cricket  prepares for life without the redoubtable Steve Waugh, a  blueprint is in place to keep his aura growing.  According to manager Robert Joske  the only non-family  member consulted on the retirement issue  Steve will be  provided maximum exposure on the most appropriate platform(s). Significantly, while January 6 will be his last appearance (versus India, on home turf Sydney) with the Baggy Green, Steve will continue with New South Wales till the 2003-2004 season ends in March.  Ive been flooded with invitations  for lectures and so on In fact, a minute before your call,  I took one from the US for public speaking Theres so much  else to do as well, Joske told The Telegraph on  Thursday. [The manager, by the way, is much in demand as Australias Test captain has decided not to interact with the Fourth Estate till the mandatory Media conference on the eve of next weeks Brisbane match.] For one, Steve has (in principle) been offered the anchors role in a 13-episode weekly programme to be telecast on Nine Network. The icon, though, must first get his pilot cleared. Details will be announced once the pilot is approved Of course, its reasonable to assume that cricket will figure in a big way. Having said that, the episodes wont just be about one sport, Joske informed, when contacted on his cellphone. Given that Steve is a pretty prolific writer, another bestseller is on the card. Actually, its a priority. Extending his excellent relationship with sponsors (MRF and AMP Sanmar, for example) is also a priority. As the manager put it: Steve is contracted to make periodic visits to India and thats not going to change. If anything, India will now see more of him Obviously, Steve is going to find time for trips to Calcutta and Udayan. Indeed, soon he should be more involved with Ashray, a home for daughters of leprosy sufferers. This project, it may be recalled, is independent of his Udayan commitment. Moreover, having formally been appointed his countrys tourism ambassador, Steve will remain Australias face in India. The manager, however, clarified no visits have been planned to specifically support the Australian Tourism Commission drive. My understanding is that the trips will coincide with commitments towards sponsors, he pointed out. Asked about Steves body- language in the hours immediately after his (retirement) announcement on Wednesday, Joske replied: Oh, he was looking ahead positively He felt strong (mentally) and quite liked the Media response Above everything else, he is happy that he is going out on his terms  against a team he admires Not that a confirmation was needed, but Joske did emphasise Steves decision was carefully thought of.  It wouldnt have been his if it wasnt so.  Copyright

 Hewitt, Clijsters pull off rare double
Indian Wells: World number one Lleyton Hewitt and third-ranked Kim Clijsters have been dating for more than three years but on Sunday they pulled off a rare feat by winning their respective ATP and WTA Masters titles at the Pacific Life Open. Not since Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert won the 1974 Wimbledon titles have a couple triumphed at a major tournament. Husband and wife Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf started dating just after they both lifted the 1999 French Open trophies. Top seed Clijsters defeated fourth seed Lindsay Davenport 6-4, 7-5 on Sunday and an hour and a half later Hewitt completed a 6-1, 6-1 rout of unseeded Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten. Its fantastic for the both of us to come here, No. 1 seeds, everyone wanting to knock us off, Hewitt told reporters. Weve been able to handle the pressure and situation very well this week. Its a bit awkward going on straight after her. Id much rather be out there supporting her than sitting in the locker room waiting said the Australian. Clijsters said that when she left to practice at 7.50 am (local time), Hewitt was still sleeping. I didnt think he was worried about my final too much. Hes been in these big finals more than I have but I dont think theres much stress involved on my side. (Reuters)  Copyright

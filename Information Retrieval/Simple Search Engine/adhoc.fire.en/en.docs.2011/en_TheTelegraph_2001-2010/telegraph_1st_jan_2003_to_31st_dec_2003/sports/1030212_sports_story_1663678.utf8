The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vasco hold Salgaocar 
 Margao: Salgaocars title hopes received a jolt when they were held goalless by Vasco in the National Football League Tuesday. With this draw, Salgaocar have 24 points from 13 matches, while Vasco have 23. It must have been a disappointing result for Salgaocar, who were hoping to close in on leaders East Bengal. Even Vasco had a chance to do so. East Bengal are on 30 and they take on Churchill Brothers in a crucial away-tie Thursday. Vasco had the edge of their state rivals in the first half but Salgaocar keeper Kalyan Chowbey stood firm. (PTI)  Copyright

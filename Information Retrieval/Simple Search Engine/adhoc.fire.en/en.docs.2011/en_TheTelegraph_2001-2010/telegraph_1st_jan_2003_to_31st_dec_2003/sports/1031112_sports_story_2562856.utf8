The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ghavri blames batsmen for loss 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Not surprisingly, Karsan Ghavri is a very disappointed man. Not even in his nightmare had he foreseen Bengal capitulating the way they did in their Ranji Trophy opener against Rajasthan in Jaipur on Monday. The coach put the blame, for the 152-run thrashing, squarely on his batsmen. Poor starts in both innings didnt help but for fighting knocks by Rohan (Gavaskar) and Sanjeeb (Sanyal) in the second innings, there was hardly any fight. The batting was pathetic, a total disaster, Ghavri said just before emplaning for Calcutta. What irked Ghavri even more was the fact that the pitch was a beauty. On all four days, the wicket played very well, he observed. Bengal were skittled out for 118 in the first innings and managed 251 in the second. Ghavri had no complaints against the bowlers. Considering the nature of the pitch, they did a good job. With two tough games coming up against Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Ghavri wants the players to erase the Jaipur memory as quickly as possible. We have to fight back, theres no option after losing the first match. I still think my team can turn around.  Unchanged squad The selectors have decided to stick to the same XIV for the game against Karnataka beginning on Saturday. The squad, which returned to the city late Tuesday evening, will fly out to Bangalore on Thursday. Since the clash with Tamil Nadu begins five days after the Karnataka tie, Rohan amp; Co. will travel straight from Bangalore to the next venue, Tirunelveli.  Copyright

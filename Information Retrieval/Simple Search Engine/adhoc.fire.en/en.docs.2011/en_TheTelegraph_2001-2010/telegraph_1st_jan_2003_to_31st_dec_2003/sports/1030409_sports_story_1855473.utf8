 Pakistan crush Kenya to keep slate clean
 Shoaib Malik in full flow during his knock of 76 against Kenya in Sharjah Tuesday. (Reuters) Sharjah: Pakistan handed Kenya a 143-run thrashing in the last league match of the Sharjah Cup Tuesday. Paceman Mohammed Sami was the wrecker-in-chief with four for 25. Kenyan wickets fell like nine-pins and they were all out for 143 in 31.4 overs chasing 287 for victory. Maurice Odumbe (54) and Hitesh Modi (27) put up a semblance of a fight, but it was not enough as the Pakistani bowlers ran away with the game. With this win Pakistan finsihed the group phase with nine points from three games and they will play Zimbabwe in Thursdays final. Earlier, their young guns continued to impress in hitting important knocks to take their side to a challenging 286 for eight against Kenya in the last league match today. Shoaib Malik top-scored with a fine 76 as Pakistan, who have already qualified for Thursdays final with Zimbabwe, placed themselves in a position of strength to carve their third successive victory in the tournament. Kenya, who impressed one and all by reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup in South Africa, kept the Pakistani batsmen in check in the initial overs but were overpowered later in this inconsequential match which was watched only by a handful of supporters. Apart from Malik, who struck six fours and a six in his 58-ball knock, Misbah-ul Haq and Mohammed Hafeez also played valuable knocks of 42 and 36 runs, respectively. Captain Rashid Latif, who elected to bat first after winning the toss, made 38 off 30 balls which had two fours and two sixes. However, it was Malik who was the biggest star. He put on 76 runs for the sixth wicket with Latif in ten overs, and opened the floodgates after reaching his 50 with a boundary in the 47th over. He hit a flurry of big shots, completely unnerving the Kenyan side which suddenly started making a number of errors, even dropping an easy chance of Malik. Malik was finally out in the 49th over when he was caught at the long-on boundary by Maurice Odumbe while going for another big hit.  Seventh wicket association with Naved-ul Hassan fetched 44 from just four overs. Hassan also chipped in, making 13.Pakistans lower order enjoyed themselves, hammering 64 off the last five overs with Sami slamming 12 off just four balls. (PTI)  Copyright

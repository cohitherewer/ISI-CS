The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Silver for Anju in Stockholm
 - IAAF SUPER GP - World 100 m record-holder Montgomery finishes sixth  Tuesday, Anju Bobby George gave her best performance in the European circuit this year New Delhi: Asian Games gold medallist Anju Bobby George won the silver medal in the womens long jump at the Stockholm IAAF Super Grand Prix meet on Tuesday night. According to information received here Wednesday, the 25-year-old leaped 6.49m to finish second and win 2400 euros (approximately Rs 1.25 lakh). Swedens Carolina Kluft (6.59m) clinched the gold, while Spains Concepcion Montaner was third with an effort of 6.48m. This was Anjus best performance in her first year on the European circuit after finishing fourth in Rome and sixth in Madrid. The Kerala girl, currently ranked No. 9 in the world, had achieved a seasons best of 6.65m in Eagle Rock, US, in June. World record holder Tim Montgomery finished a miserable sixth in the 100 m Tuesday before saying he is likely to return to the US rather than compete again in Europe before the world championships in Paris later this month, adds a report from Stockholm. Montgomery arrived in Stockholm saying he was serious about breaking the stadium record of 9.87 seconds, but had a poor start and never got into the race, finishing in 10.37. I have no clue what went wrong, no idea whats going on. Im puzzled, Montgomery admitted, shaking his head in consternation. I think this is it... It is time to go home. Ill sit down with my coach, he said. On paper, Montgomery will be a favourite for the gold medal at the world championships in Paris from August 23 to 31. But on Tuesday night he was easily eclipsed by compatriot Justin Gatlin who finished first in 10.15 seconds against a headwind of 2.4 m etres per second. Christine Arron of France won the womens 100 m in 11.11 seconds, 0.02 seconds ahead of American Chryste Gaines. Stephen Cherono produced the cool evenings top result by beating fellow Kenyan Kipsiele Paul Koech in the spurt to win the 3,000 m steeplechase in eight minutes 4.75 seconds, shaving just over a second off his own world best this year. South Africas Hestrie Cloete, the reigning world champion, beat Kajsa Bergqvist in the womens high jump. Cloete cleared 2.01 m, improving her personal best of the year by 1 cm and gaining a psychological advantage over Bergqvist, who managed only 1.95m and was a pale shadow of the athlete who cleared 2.06m, a world best this year, on July 26. World record holder Yelena Isinbayeva cemented her position as the leading lady in the womens pole vault, beating a strong field to win with a jump of 4.63 m. (AGENCIES)  Copyright

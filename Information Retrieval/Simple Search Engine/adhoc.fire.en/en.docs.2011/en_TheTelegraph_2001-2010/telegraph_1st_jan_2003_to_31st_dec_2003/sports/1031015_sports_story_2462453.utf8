 Aussies debate future of sledging 
 - Cricket Australia is paying a lot of attention to on-field behaviour of its players  Ponting says its  okay  Steve is willing  ti rethinkMelbourne: Australias desire to cut out sledging is a separate issue to the art of gamesmanship, World Cup hero Andrew Symonds said on Tuesday. National ruling body Cricket Australia (CA) issued a statement on October 1 warning players they could face life bans if they breached a new code of conduct outlawing on-field sledging. What you wont see is sledging. What you will see is gamesmanship, Symonds, 28, said. At times you will see heated things said but hopefully it will be a bit more controlled, added the Queensland allrounder, who scored 326 runs in this years World Cup including 143 not out against Pakistan and 91 not out in the semi-final against Sri Lanka. I dont think there is that much that is said, its just that the cameras are right up close and see all your facial expressions. The boys just have to be a little bit more subtle when something is said. No one is condoning sledging. Australia Test captain Steve Waugh announced last week the players had written a new set of conduct guidelines themselves, included in CAs Code of Behaviour, urging each other to cut out personal insults and accept umpiring decisions. Incidents such as fast bowler Glenn McGraths angry exchange with West Indies batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan earlier this year will in future lead to the Australia player having explaining his actions to his teammates. Well try and work it out among ourselves to start with, Waugh said. But Waughs deputy Ricky Ponting said he would continue to take the verbal fight to opponents. Whats wrong with saying (to an opponent) that hes suspect against good bouncers or something? the 70-Test veteran said. Waughs top-ranked team has been heavily criticised in recent years for persistent on-field sledging and CA is determined to clean up their act. Waughs side has thrived on gaining a psychological edge over opponents with some on-field chat, which the skipper has described as a policy of mental disintegration. We want emotion, we want passion ... banter is a part of the game. But now we know the standard expected of each other and hopefully (breaches) will be less and less, Waugh said.

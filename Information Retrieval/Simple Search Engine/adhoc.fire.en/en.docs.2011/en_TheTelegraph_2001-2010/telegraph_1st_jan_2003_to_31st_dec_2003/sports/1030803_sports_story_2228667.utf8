The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Giving it all up was quite unlike him 
 - Gooch feels every man chooses his time, but protg Hussain will be respected for leading with honour, passion and aggression  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Gooch is disappointed			Calcutta, Aug. 2: The captain who never hid behind excuses has given it all away and, while the Media in England continues to speculate on why Nasser Hussain suddenly quit on Monday, many in India have been saddened. The Chennai-born Hussain, after all, never quite forgot his roots even as he continued to climb after his maiden call-up, in 1989-90. Of course, he was very proud to be the England captain but, equally, proud of his links (through father Jawad) with India. Significantly, if theres one other association Hussain has always been proud of, its the Essex one. Its there that he met Graham Gooch (among Test crickets most prolific rungetters) and, quickly, gave him mentor-status. Like the rest of the cricket fraternity, though, Gooch  a former England captain, selector and batting coach  has been taken aback by Hussains decision. Indeed, he said as much when The Telegraph contacted him on his cellphone late on Friday.  The following are excerpts On Hussains decision to  quit after the drawn first Test against South Africa, at  Edgbaston  Like everybody else, that took me by surprise Every  man chooses his time but, frankly, I dont know Nassers  reasons. Its not that England suffered a heavy defeat or  People are searching for an explanation  On whether, as Hussains  mentor, he felt let down  I was and I am disappointed In fact, Nasser played  for Essex a few weeks ago and didnt even remotely indicate  he was planning to leave He didnt get runs (1 and 23 not  out) in what turned out to be his last Test as captain,  but did lead England to wins in three consecutive Tests  (Sydney, Lords and Chester-le-Street) just prior to that.  Actually, after the draw, Nasser had everything to play  for. Giving it all up was quite unlike him. Irrespective  of what he said, it appeared a spur-of-the-moment decision.  On whether Hussain spoke  to him immediately after going public with his resignation  He didnt call Must have had  other things on his mind. (After a pause) I still  havent spoken to him but, when I do, Ill compliment Nasser  for the fine job as England captain.  On whether Hussain had begun  to get things wrong  No. As Ive said, Nasser led England  to three consecutive Test wins before the Edgbaston draw.  Obviously, you cant find fault with that Moreover, when  he played for Essex, he seemed in good nick. So, I wouldnt  say there was anything wrong with Nasser the batsman either  Except versus Australia, our performance against the other  countries definitely improved in the four years that Nasser  was captain. He left England in good condition.  On whether the controversial  Zimbabwe issue, during the 2003 World Cup, will be remembered  as the proverbial turning point in Hussains captaincy  I wouldnt subscribe to that.  On whether repeated injuries  at critical times to key players and the Graham Thorpe affair  affected Hussain (Interrupting) But every captain  has to make do with the available resources. Injuries are  part of the game. Then, for whatever reason, a key player  may not be available for long periods On Hussains legacy  Nasser will be respected as somebody  who led with honour, passion and aggression. He made rather  heavy demands on his players and, most of the time, they  responded. (Adds laughing) Nasser was quite a fiery  captain.  On Hussains future as a  Test batsman  My belief is that he has it in  him to contribute for a while  On Hussains successor,  Michael Vaughan  Hasnt got the start he was looking  for In time, though, I expect him to be his own man. In  any case, he already has one-day wins under his belt.  On England having begun  the summer with separate captains  That couldnt be avoided because  Nasser was through with the ODIs Having two captains can  work but, ideally, each country should have one.  Finally, on how difficult  was it for him to quit as England captain (in 1993)?  At least, there was a reason   we had just lost the Ashes and, so I dont think I deliberated  for too long. Nor, for that matter, did I take an on-the-spot  decision Honestly, its always easier being the vice-captain  or one of the seniors. The decisions have to be taken by  somebody else.  Copyright

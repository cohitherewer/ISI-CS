The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Symonds leads Aussie charge
Port-of-Spain: A classy 80 by Brian Lara guided West Indies to 290 for five on Sunday in the fifth one-day International. Lara, who batted at number three, shared a 178-run partnership with opener Wavell Hinds on a pitch starting to deteriorate. A 92-run stand for the fourth wicket between Andrew Symonds and Michael Clarke (39) helped Australia reach 170 for four after 35 overs. Symonds was batting on 68 and Michael Bevan on 4. The West Indies skipper barely had time to pad up after winning the toss when opener Chris Gayle (5) was trapped leg before by an inswinging delivery from pace bowler Brett Lee. Hinds powerful drives provided a pleasing contrast to Laras deft strokes. The opener hit eight boundaries and crashed two mighty sixes into the stands to push up the West Indies run rate.

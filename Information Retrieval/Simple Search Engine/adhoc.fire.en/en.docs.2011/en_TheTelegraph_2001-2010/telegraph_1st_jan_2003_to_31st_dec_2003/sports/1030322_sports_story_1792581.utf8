The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Awaiting a fascinating contest
 - Shepherd, Bucknor set ot complete  hattrick of Cup finals FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Buchanan: Impressed  with India  Johannesburg: John Buchanan,  the Australian coach, has been impressed with Team Indias  recent performances. Both of us played Kenya but,  while we werent at the top of our game (in the Super Six),  India handed out a crushing defeat in the semi-finals...  Obviously, today, your team is a lot different from the  one which took the field in Centurion (February 15), Buchanan  told The Telegraph Friday afternoon. He added: Sundays final is going  to be a fascinating contest and I, for one, am looking forward  to it... Speaking about Damien Martyns  fitness, Buchanan said a decision would probably be taken  Saturday morning. However, he indicated Martyn (who has  fractured his right index finger) wouldnt be risked unless  he was hundred per cent fit. The Australians, by the way, had  a full workout in the morning, after which Darren Lehmann  interacted with the Media. He didnt have much to say except  warn India about plenty of deliveries aimed at the body. Actually, Lehmann needs to watch  out for the Zaheer Khans.  Meanwhile, the respected duo of  David Shepherd and Steve Bucknor will officiate Sunday   in fact, it will be their third successive final. While  Rudi Koertzen is going to be the TV (third) umpire, Billy  Bowden has been named fourth umpire. The last-named, a New  Zealander, is understood to have earned high marks throughout  the tournament. [Incidentally, that Srinivas Venkatraghavan  wasnt assigned the Australia-Sri Lanka semi-final hasnt  gone unnoticed.] Not surprisingly, Ranjan Madugalle  will be the Match Referee Sunday. He had the same role in  1999 as well. Copyright

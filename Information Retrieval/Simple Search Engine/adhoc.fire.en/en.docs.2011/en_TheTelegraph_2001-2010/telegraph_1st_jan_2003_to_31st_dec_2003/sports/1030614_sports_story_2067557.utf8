The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, June 14, 2003  Fond Fantasy for Stakes 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 Prakash				 										Bangalore: Fond Fantasy, unbeaten in her two career starts, which she won in style on each occasion, is tipped to lift the 1,600m Fillies Trial Stakes, the first classic of the season and main attraction on Saturday here.				 										The Razeen-Excentrique filly has been tuned to perfection by trainer S. Ganapathy. She will come up against some serious opposition from One Magic Moment and Ramjet who look the best of the ten challengers to put in a keen fight. However, going by her victories over the shorter spr-ints, Fond, who is bred to stay, may be at an advantage in the care of her partner B. Prakash.

 Kim Collins puts St Kitts on the map

(AFP) Paris: Kim Collins squeezed across the line in the world mens 100 metres final on Monday to give the tiny Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis its first world track champion. Only six hundredths of a second separated the first six men with the winning time of 10.07 seconds equal to the previous slowest in a world final. Carl Lewis also clocked 10.07 in the first world championships 20 years ago in Helsinki, the year in which Collinss tiny nation gained independence. Eighteen-year-old Trinidadian Darrel Brown, who set a world junior record on Sunday, was second and Briton Darren Campbell came home third ahead of his compatriot and European champion Dwain Chambers. Collins, however, scrapped ambitions for a sprint double on Tuesday by pulling out of the 200m heats. The 27-year-old explained that he had not run enough 200 metres this season to warrant competing in the event. Greene, who has never regained his best form since injuring his leg in the Edmonton final, sustained another injury in Mondays semi-finals. After a flying start, he slowed markedly and said later his left thigh was swollen and painful. After the formerly invincible Haile Gebrselassie was defeated in Sundays 10,000m final, Olympic champion Maurice Greene, defending pole vault champion Stacy Dragila and world triple jump record holder Jonathan Edwards all departed early. Dragila, twice world and once Olympic champion in her fledgling event, failed to clear 4.60m and relinquished the title to Russian Svetlana Feofanova. Edwards, 37, who announced before the championships that he would retire after Mondays final, made two jumps and then decided to pull out. His withdrawal cleared the way for Swede Christian Olsson to win his first global title with a leap of 17.72 metres. Irina Yatchenko, 37, became the oldest world champion ever when she won the womens discus final to hand Belarus their third gold medal of the world championships. Yatchenko replaced Russian Yelena Nikolayeva, who won the womens 20 km walk on Sunday and is also 37 but four months younger. Her compatriot Ivan Tikhon won the hammer as Belarus replaced Ethiopia at the top of the medals table. South African Jacques Freitag won the mens high jump gold with a leap of 2.35.  Neelam flops in final Asian Games discus champion Neelam Jaswant Singh, who created history by becoming the first Indian to qualify for the world championship final, came up with a disappointing show in the medal round. She finished 12th among 13 finalists. The 32-year-old, who produced her seasons best effort of 60.33m to go past the qualifying mark of 60m, managed a best of just 57.92m on Monday evening.

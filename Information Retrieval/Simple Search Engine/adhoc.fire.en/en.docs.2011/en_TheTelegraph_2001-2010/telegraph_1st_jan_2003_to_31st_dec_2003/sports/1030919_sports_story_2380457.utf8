The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Makaay proves worth
Berlin: Roy Makaays recent goals for Bayern Munich have started to suggest that he was worth every cent of his expensive transfer fee. Bayern, always reluctant to spend huge sums on high-profile players, wanted a top striker so badly that they agreed to pay a club record 18.75 million euros ($21.16 million) to purchase the Dutch forward from Deportivo La Coruna. The 28-year-old needed time to adapt but his two goals in Wednesdays 2-1 Champions League victory over Celtic indicated that he was now ready to deliver. I always knew that he was a man for important goals, goalkeeper and captain Oliver Kahn said after Makaay rescued the Bavarians in their group A opener at the Olympic stadium. Just when we needed him, he was there. Makaay had failed to score in Bayerns first four Bundesliga games and the fans started wondering whether it had been a good idea to spend so much money on him, and to let reliable Brazilian striker Elber move to Lyon. But Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld knew that a player who ended top-scorer in Spain last season with 29 goals  quite an achievement in a league featuring the likes of Raul, Ronaldo and Patrick Kluivert  could be relied on. My view was he had until Christmas to prove his worth, Hitzfeld said. We didnt have to wait that long. The striker, who joined after a bitter row between Bayern and Deportivo, scored his first league goal on Saturday, but Bayern lost 2-3 at VfL Wolfsburg and Makaay was not happy. He definitely was on Wednesday after his late efforts enabled Bayern to snatch victory. (Reuters)  Copyright

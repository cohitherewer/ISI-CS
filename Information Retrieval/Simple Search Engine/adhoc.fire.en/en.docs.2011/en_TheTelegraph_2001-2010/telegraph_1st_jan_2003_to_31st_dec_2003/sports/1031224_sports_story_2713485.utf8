The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Murali warns selectors
 Handle me with care, says Murali Colombo: Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralidharan said on Tuesday the Test wicket-taking record was within his reach, but warned selectors to ease his workload following a spate of injuries. The 31-year-old off-spinner has claimed 485 wickets in 85 Tests, putting him behind former West Indian pace bowler Courtney Walsh (519) and Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne (491). Muralidharan said he is confident of finishing his career with 600 dismissals. Breaking the record is within my reach, he said. Muralidharan said it would be a tough battle with Warne to overtake Walsh, a fight likely to start during Australias February-March tour of Sri Lanka. Warne is currently completing a 12-month ban from cricket after testing positive for use of a banned drug, but will be eligible for Test selection for the Sri Lankan tour. I think there will soon be a race between Warne and me, but that is a challenge which I like, he said. Muralidharans ever-expanding range of deliveries has tormented batsmen for over a decade and his 26 wickets in three Tests during the just-concluded series against England showed he still mesmerises batsmen. But a spate of injuries on his bowling shoulder and groin are now worrying Muralidharan, who has long carried the burden of the Sri Lankan attack. The 231.4 overs he bowled during the England series highlighted the workload that left his shoulder sore, and required him to constantly use an ice-pack between matches. Muralidharan warned selectors they risk losing his services if they push him into too much cricket. He said he was not sure how long he would last given the hectic schedule of international cricket. He said domestic matches were also putting greater strain on his body. If they make me play in the provincial tournaments as well, it will be difficult for me when the Australians come, he said. Sri Lankas coach John Dyson says the constant ice-pack on Muralidharans shoulder was just a protective method to ease the soreness.  (AP)  Copyright

 Kaif takes Derby home 
London: Mohammed Kaif hit an unbeaten half century to guide Derbyshire to a six-wicket victory against Sussex in a National League one-day match at county ground, Derby. Kaif made 55 from 62 balls with four boundaries as Derbyshire raced to 163 in 30.5 overs in the second division match with seven balls to spare, overhauling the 160-run target set by Sussex in the rain-affected match on Sunday. The Indian youngster combined well with Dominic Hewson, who made a 29-ball 39, for the fourth wicket to take the score from 65 for three to 129 when Hewson departed 32 runs short of the victory. Earlier, Sussex were helped by a 55-ball 60 from Matthew Prior, but some good bowling from Graeme Welch (two for 27) and Dominic Cork (two for 34) restricted them in the 45-over match which was shortened to 32 overs due to rain.

 Anand draws crucial game 
Dortmund, Aug. 9 (PTI): Viswanathan Anand conceded a half-point to GM Arkadi Naiditsch of Germany in the ninth and penultimate round of the Dortmund Sparkassen chess tournament on Saturday. With this draw Anand has almost no hope of winning the prestigious event he won in 1996 and 2000. The Indian is on five points and is expected to trail leader Viktor Bologan of Moldova by 1.5 point points. Kramnik drew with GM Peter Leko of Hungary and remains joint second with Anand.  Copyright

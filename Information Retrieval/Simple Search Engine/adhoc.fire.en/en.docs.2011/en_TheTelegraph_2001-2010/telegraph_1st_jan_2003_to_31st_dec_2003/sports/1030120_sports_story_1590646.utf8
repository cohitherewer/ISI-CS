		 Monday, January 20, 2003 				 ICC will try to break Lanka deadlock
																								Colombo: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will try to resolve the confusion over Sri Lankan World Cup contracts on Monday after Sri Lankas cricket board failed to agree terms with its players over the weekend.																								The Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) was unable to secure completed World Cup player contracts on Sunday after missing a Friday deadline set by the ICC.																								The BCCSL said it could not meet a player demand for 20 per cent of the revenue from the World Cup, and was instead offering the players 10 per cent of revenue plus a match incentive fee.																								The BCCSL is unable to meet this demand because it is unreasonable and is not based on performance, it said in a statement.																								It will seriously undermine the Boards ability to meet its obligations vis--vis the developmental activities for domestic cricket.																								The BCCSL ... has urged the squad members to act reasonably in the larger interests of Sri Lankan cricket and finalise the contracts immediately.																								However, in the event that the squad members fail to do so, the BCCSL will be reluctantly compelled to avail itself of all remedies available to it.																								On Thursday, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed warned that failure to return the tournament contracts by the following day would have very serious consequences for the BCCSL.																								The dispute between the Sri Lankan board and its players has not been as complicated for the ICC to handle as the protracted sponsorship row, which has threatened Indias participation in the World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its time to face the Olonga music
London: Having faced the music for protesting against the political regime in his country, former Zimbabwe fast bowler Henry Olonga now plans to launch a singing career. At this stage I would say music is the more likely option for me, said Olonga, who retired from international cricket in dramatic circumstances on Saturday. I sing R amp;B (reggae and blues) and music for the stage. I even have some songs recorded but I dont know whether they are up to industry standard, Olonga, who is in hiding fearing threats to his life, said. But if I can find someone who likes what I do then maybe I can release a CD, he was quoted as saying in The Guardian Monday. Olonga was taken by surprise when asked if he had an agent. No. Yesterday I was a cricketer. The 26-year-old seamer does not have as much option as his teammate Andy Flower, who also announced his retirement from the international game and will play County cricket. But Olonga is hoping his talent as a singer may be the key to a successful future. Two years ago he recorded a single called our Zimbabwe which topped the charts in his country. The CD had five versions  English, Dance, Instrumental and Shona and Ndebele, ethnic groups within Zimbabwe  and British television viewers were treated to him singing a Capella on the BBC show on side three years ago. Olonga is expected to stay in South Africa while he decides where to go and what to do. His ultimate destination will be determined by his choice of career, which could also include television punditry. I have yet to decide, he said. But Olonga knows his prospects of finding a county are limited as most of the teams have already filled their quota of two overseas players and those who have not have made a financial decision to have only one. As for places to live, Olonga said there was a toss-up between Britain and the United States. He has family spread over the world. My father is in Zimbabwe, my stepmum is in England, my real mum is in Australia, I have a stepbrother in England and a stepsister in Kenya. You wont remember all that, will you? The maverick paceman shot to fame in the 1999 World Cup removing three Indian batsmen in one over to ensure a place for Zimbabwe in the Super Six.  (PTI)  Copyright

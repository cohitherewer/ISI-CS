The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla crash to innings loss again 
 - Second innings 5/69 gives Paul Adams ten for the match  Paul Adams in action on Day IV of the first Test between South Africa and Bangladesh in Chittagong Sunday. (AFP) Chittagong: Paul Adams finished with a 10-wicket match haul as South Africa inflicted an innings defeat on Bangladesh in the first Test here on Sunday. Bangladesh were left 60 runs short of making South Africa bat again as the left-arm spinner took five for 69 to help bowl out Bangladesh for 237 at the M.A. Aziz Stadium. It was the third five-wicket effort for Adams, who had taken five for 37 in the first innings. It has been a great Test for me, said Adams. Going into the match I knew it would be a good game for me and as it turned out, I could extract both turn and bounce from the wicket. On Sunday, Adams took the wickets of former captain Akram Khan, Mashrafe bin Murtaza and Enamul Haque as Bangladesh, overnight 185 for five, folded up just 55 minutes into the day. Bangladesh captain Khaled Mahmud conceded it was another disappointing performance from his side. We could not make a match of it despite some good knocks from batsmen Habibul Bashar and Javed Omar, said Mahmud, who led his side for the first time in Tests. Bashar (75) and Omar (71) were in a 131-run stand for the second wicket on Saturday, the highest partnership for Bangladesh for any wicket. But we were outplayed by a much better side. Jacques Rudolphs innings in particular was a great one, said Mahmud. Left-hander Rudolph (222 not out) got a rare double-century on debut and was declared Man of the Match. He was involved in an unbroken partnership of 429 for the third wicket with Dippenaar (177), the best stand for any wicket for South Africa and the sixth-best ever in the history of Test cricket. South African captain Graeme Smith too praised Rudolphs effort. It was a superb knock and the team has come a long way since the first one-dayer of the Dhaka tri-series, said 22-year-old Smith, the youngest South African captain in both Tests and ODIs. Our aim is to become the worlds best side and our work has just begun, said Smith. No international match is easy and one had to work hard in the heat and humidity here. South Africa, here with a new-look side and a new captain, were declared joint winners with India in a tri-series in Dhaka earlier this month as rain washed out the final. This was the third consecutive innings victory for South Africa over Bangladesh, who have now lost 17 of 18 Tests since gaining Test status over two years ago. The second and final Test of the series will be held in Dhaka from May 1.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Law to protect Olympic symbols
Berlin: Germany has prepared a law to protect the Olympic symbols in order to boost Leipzigs chances of getting the 2012 Summer Games, German Justice Minister Brigitte Zypries said on Sunday. Zypries said a draft legislation to comply with the demands of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was ready and would be submitted to parliament before the end of the year. We have reacted to the demands of the IOC, who want the Olympic symbols to be strictly protected by law, Zypries said. A country which does not fulfil that condition has no chance to successfully bid for the Olympics, she added. The eastern city of Leipzig won a vote by the German Olympic Committee (NOK) earlier this month to represent Germany in the race for 2012. The IOC will decide on the venue of the 2012 Games in 2005. Madrid, New York and Moscow are the only other firm candidates so far, while London, Paris and Rio de Janeiro are also possible bidders. Athens will stage the Games next year and Beijing will host them in 2008.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

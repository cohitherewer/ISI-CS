The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. ride Dipendu double
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  WB Polices Ujjwal Samanta foils a Dipendu Biswas goalmouth attempt at Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting rode Dipendu Biswas double strike to a 2-0 victory over West Bengal Police in the Super Division tie at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. Despite the victory, the black-and white brigade hardly looked inspiring in their effort in the goalless first half. Their display lacked imagination and co-ordination in the slushy ground conditions. WB Police have been the weakest of the Super Division teams this season. They have conceded 21 goals in seven matches managing three points. It was only expected, then, that Mohammedan Sporting would ride roughshod over such an opponent. Instead, on display were some mundane crosses from the wings, which were intercepted without much trouble by the policemen. Sheikh Sanjibs introduction in the second session saw some enterprising moves being initiated. One such attack in the 57th minute saw Sanjib being tripped from behind inside the box by a rival defender. The resultant penalty fetched Dipendus first goal in the League. Six minutes later came the second goal. Dipendu moved down the left unchallenged, cut into the box and put the ball past an advancing goalkeeper. TEAMS Mohammedan Sporting: Amar Das, Amjad Khan, Hussain Mustafi, Satish Bharti, Amandeep Singh, Bungo Singh, Iqbal Khan, Khaled Siddiqui (Dipankar Chatterjee, 81), Satish Minz (Sheikh Sanjib, 45), Rahim Nabi, Dipendu Biswas.

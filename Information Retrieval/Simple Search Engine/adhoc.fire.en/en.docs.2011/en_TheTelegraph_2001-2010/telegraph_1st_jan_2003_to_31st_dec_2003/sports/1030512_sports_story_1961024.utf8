 Mantilla makes history 
Rome: Felix Mantilla became the first unseeded player to win in Rome since the Open era began in 1968 by beating fourth seed Roger Federer in the Rome Masters final Sunday. Mantilla, who made his first final of the year, beat Switzerlands Federer 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 to win his 10th title. Federer mixed the pace of his groundstrokes to create seven break-points, but wasted them all, in the first set. The 29-year-old Mantilla then took advantage of some unforced errors in the 12th game to break serve and win the first set. The Spaniard broke again in the sixth and eighth games of the second set to run out a comfortable 6-2 winner. A see-saw third set went to a tiebreak, which Mantilla won when Federer smashed a forehand over the baseline.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

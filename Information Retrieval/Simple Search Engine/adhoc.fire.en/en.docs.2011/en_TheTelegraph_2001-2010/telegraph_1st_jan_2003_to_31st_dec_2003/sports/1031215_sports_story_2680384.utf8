		 Monday, December 15, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Budapest: Lothar Matthaeus was named Hungarys new national team coach on Sunday following his surprise resignation from Partizan Belgrade. The Hungarian Football Association made the announcement after a board meeting early on Sunday. Matthaeus will sign a two-year contract covering the 2006 World Cup qualifiers. The 43-year-old quit Partizan on Saturday after just a year in charge at the Serbia and Montenegro club citing personal reasons.				 																																	He replaces Imre Gellei who stepped down earlier this month after Hungarys disappointing Euro 2004 qualifying campaign. German media had reported that Matthaeus wanted to live in Budapest as his new wife, a Serbian businesswoman he married last month, has a business in Hungary. 				 																																	Madrid: Arsenal received a formal offer from Chelsea billionaire owner Roman Abramovich earlier this week for Thierry Henry, the Spanish sports daily As said on Saturday.				 																																	British media on Sunday said the sum offered was between  40 m and  50 m. But Arsenal have ruled out any possibility of the striker leaving despite the interest not only of Chelsea but also Spanish champions Real Madrid. Vice-chairman David Dein was quoted by As, saying that Arsenal had received a formal offer from Chelsea for the 26-year-old French international, but that they would be rejecting any approaches.				 																																	Look carefully at my lips so that there is no doubt over what I am going to say, Dein told an As reporter at Fridays Champions League draw in Nyon.Henry is not for sale at any price, not to Real Madrid, not to Chelsea, not to any club.				 																																	We know that Real Madrid are interested in our player and we know that Chelsea also want him because last week Roman Abramovich himself came to Highbury to present a formal offer for him.				 																																	Lahore: Pakistan snatched a golden goal to beat arch rivals India 10-9 on Sunday and qualify for next years polo World Cup in France.				 																																	The teams were tied at 9-9 in a qualifying match when Pakistan captain Qublai Alam forced the winning goal in the opening moments of the sixth chakkar.				 																																	In the only other match today, unbeaten Australia beat Singapore 11-4.5.				 																																	Australia finished at the top of the five-team event, also qualifying for the World Cup. India, who won two of their four matches, finished third in the zone D qualifying rounds while Singapore came fourth with one win.

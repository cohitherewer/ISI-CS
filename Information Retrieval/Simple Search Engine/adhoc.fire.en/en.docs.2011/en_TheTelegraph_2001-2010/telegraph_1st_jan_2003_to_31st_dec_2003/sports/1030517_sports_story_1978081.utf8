 Caddick to miss Tests
London: England pace bowler Andy Caddick will miss the two-Test series against Zimbabwe starting at Lords next Thursday because of a foot injury. Caddick, 34, seventh in the list of Englands all-time leading wicket-takers with 234 victims, has damaged ligaments in the arch of his right foot. All rounder Andy Flintoff, who has an injury in his right shoulder, is also doubtful for the first Test.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

				 	 SASIKIRAN: Pushed down to 5th																								Hastings : Indian Grandmaster K.Sasikiran failed to break his win-less sequence as he was held to a draw by Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine in the fourth round of the Hastings International Chess Congress here on Wednesday.																								The other Indian in the fray, GM P.Harikrishna split points with the meets oldest competitor GM Vitaly Tseshkovsky of Russia to maintain his second position.																								GM Peter Heine Nielsen (3.5) of Denmark defeated GM Glenn Flear of England to stretch his lead to a full point while Harikrishna and Sasikiran tallied 2.5 and 2 points, respectively, after four matches each.																								GM Alexei Barsov of Uzbekistan and GM Keith Arkell of England share the second spot with Harikrishna while the fourth successive draw pushed Sasikiran to the joint fifth position along side world womens championship runner-up Alexandra Kosteniuk of Russia.																								The match between Harikrishna and Tseshkovsky saw the latter, playing white, open with the king pawn and embark on a Scotch Opening game.																								The Russian played the middle game quite fiercely and had a definite advantage in terms of space as Harikrishna went for his counter play on the king side by opening a couple of files after the queens got traded. 																								The basic problem for Harikrishna was his light squared bishop that he successfully managed to exchange while the other pieces were off the board quickly. 																								The ensuing rook and pawns endgame was level and the draw was agreed to in 42 moves. 																								In the fourth round game Sasikiran drew against youngest-ever GM Karjakin whose results with white pieces continued to enthral the spectators. (PTI)

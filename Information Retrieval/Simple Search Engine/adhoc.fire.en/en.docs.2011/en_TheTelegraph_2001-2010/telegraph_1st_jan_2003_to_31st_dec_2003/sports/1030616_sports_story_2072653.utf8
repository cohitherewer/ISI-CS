The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dravid hits unbeaten ton 
London: The Indians on the County circuit had mixed luck on Sunday. While Rahul Dravid sizzled, Virender Sehwag and Mohammed Kaif fizzled out. Playing for Scotland, Dravid hit an unbeaten 97-ball 120 to take his team to 296 for four in 45 overs against Somerset in a national cricket league division two match at Taunton. Meanwhile, Sehwags woeful run with the bat continued as he was out for a duck against Worcestershire at Worcester. In reply to the hosts 193 for seven in 45 overs, Leicestershire suffered an early setback when Sehwag returned to the pavilion after facing just four balls. Elsewhere, Kaif fell after scoring only 12 runs as defeat stared Derbyshire, who were precariously placed at 58 for four after 15 overs in reply to Lancashires 251 for six in 45 overs. Meanwhile on Saturday, Yuvraj Singh hit a 44-ball 41 to guide Yorkshire to victory over Derbyshire in their opening Twenty20 Cup game. (PTI)  Copyright

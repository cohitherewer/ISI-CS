The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Batting appalls Whatmore
 Whatmore wants his boys to play for pride Cairns: Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore said on Sunday he was appalled at his sides display after they collapsed for 147 in 45.1 overs to lose by nine wickets against Australia in the second one-day International. Paceman Brett Lee had taken four for 25 to skittle the tourists for 105 in Saturdays eight-wicket loss but Whatmore said he was more upset with Sundays performance. Yesterday Brett Lee had a fantastic spell of bowling and there was a bit more juice in the wicket. Today simply reflected that gulf between the teams, Whatmore told a news conference. Im not concerned about losing but I am concerned about the way you lose and I was really appalled at the way some of our batsmen made decisions today and just their basic cricket knowledge. Unless they show marked improvement they are not going to get close to winning. Bangladesh lost both matches in last months Test series by an innings but showed some signs of improvement, especially in their first innings of 295 after being sent in during the second Test. However, shot-selection was poor for the tourists on Sunday as several batsmen gave their wickets away with wild slogs when a more careful attempt to try to bat out the 50 overs would have been a better approach. I dont know what to say. Im just appealing to their individual pride really, said Whatmore, who started his two-year appointment with the team in June. At least theres one positive thing. No one can complain if he gets dropped. Im still fighting to not jump to conclusions. In another couple of months Ill be in a better position to make judgments. Damien Martyn, reacting to his quickfire unbeaten 92, said later records did not enter his mind when he was on the field. Martyn, who faced just 51 balls, was stranded eight short of his hundred as Australia coasted to a nine-wicket win. Had his century come in another 10 balls or less it would have been the fourth-fastest in one-day International history. No I wouldnt have had a clue (about the records). Maybe thats what the guys are going on about right now in the rooms, Martyn said. It would have been nice to get it but its not the be-all and end-all. (Reuters)  Copyright

 SA offered insurance in Pak
Lahore: A Pakistani insurance company has stepped forward to help South Africa insure their cricket team for the tour of Pakistan starting later this week. The United Cricket Board of South Africa has failed to get insurance cover for the matches in Karachi and Peshawar, two Pakistani cities viewed as potential security risks. But a Pakistan Cricket Board official said Adamjee Insurance, their insurance agent, had offered to cover the South Africans if certain clarifications could be provided by the UCBSA. Getting insurance for the team has been a problem for the UCB, but hopefully this can now be worked out, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said on Monday. The UCBSA has sent a three-member delegation to Pakistan to assess security arrangements. The delegation, which includes the director of the South African police service, held discussions on Sunday with police officials. They also visited Karachi. Afterwards, the security team praised the security arrangements. However, the security experts said the decision on whether to play matches planned for Karachi and Peshawar rested with the United Cricket Board of South Africa. I dont see any problem in playing here. The security situation both in Karachi and Peshawar is very good, but it is for the UCBSA to decide about playing in Pakistan, Board commercial director Ian Smith said. (PTI)  Copyright

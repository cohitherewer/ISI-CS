 Shoaib gets camp-call
Karachi: Pakistan cricket selectors on Tuesday recalled ace fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar to a 21-man training camp ahead of next months tri-series in Sri Lanka. Akhtar was one of eight regular players axed following Pakistans first round exit from the World Cup. The selection committee has invited 21 players for the camp set to start tomorrow, the PCB said. The 27-year-old was a major disappointment in the World Cup. Besides hosts Sri Lanka, Pakistan and New Zealand are participating in the triangular event to be held from May 10-23.  (AFP)  Copyright

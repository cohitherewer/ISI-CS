 Abhinn upset, Nikhil moves up 
Jaipur: In a major upset, defending champion and third seed Abhinn Shyam Gupta crashed out of the Asian satellite badminton championship, going down to unfancied Kuan Beng Hong of Malaysia in the quarter finals on Thursday. Abhinn, also the national champion and ranked 57th in the world, was handed a 13-15, 15-7, 15-10 defeat by Hong, ranked 100th in the world. However, unseeded Nikhil Kanetkar sailed into the semi-finals with a comprehensive 15-1, 15-7 victory against compatriot J.B.S. Vidhyadhar. Kanetkar now runs into top seed Lee Chong Wei of Malaysia in the semi-final. Chong Wei, ranked 24th, beat Sachin Ratti 15-10, 15-8. Second seed Yeoh Key Bin of Malaysia also played to the form book, quashing the challenge of Chetan Anand 15-9, 15-4. In the womens section, the seeded players played true to their reputation.

Second seed Li Li of Singapore beat Shruti Kurian 11-2, 11-1 while third seed Salakjit Polsana of Thailand defeated Manjusha Kanwar 11-4, 11-2.

Apart from admitting to his poor finish, Abhinn later said he was distracted by an advertisement on the back wall of the court.

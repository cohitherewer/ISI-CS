 Belly bug hits Hoogenband 
Barcelona: Olympic champion Pieter van den Hoogenband, beaten three times in the world championships this week, has been struggling to get over a bout of food poisoning. After finishing third behind Russias Alexander Popov and Britains Mark Foster in the 50 m freestyle final, the Dutchman said he had gone down with food poisoning at the teams training camp in Montpellier, France, two weeks ago. Van den Hoogenband, the 2000 Olympic champion in 100 and 200 freestyle, said he had lost three or four kg in weight. He finished second to Australias Ian Thorpe in Tuesdays 200 freestyle and second to Popov in the 100 freestyle before his third place in the 50.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 South Africa on the right track: Smith
Dhaka: After his teams 83-run victory over Bangladesh, South African captain Graeme Smith said his side had improved a lot from the previous match against India and was on the right track to win the title. We improved a lot from the last game against India. But a lot of improvement is still required, said Smith who won his first one-day International as captain of South Africa. He said the inexperience of some of the bowlers remained a cause of concern but was satisfied with the overall performance of the team. In some departments we did well. Batsmen spent some time in the middle and scored important runs. But there are a few things which are worrying us. Quite a few of our bowlers are inexperienced. They have never played outside South Africa. So they still have to adjust to the conditions here, Smith said. But we did well today. We have two more games to go in the league phase. Hopefully, our good performance will continue. We are on the right track. It was a much better day as captain for me. Things went well. I have much more to learn as captain but I was quite relaxed today. Also because, I got some runs which was nice. But I need to convert my steady starts into big knocks. The skipper praised his predecessor Shaun Pollock, who returned figures of four for 36, and Allan Dawson, calling them the best two bowlers in the squad. Dawson is bowling very well. And Pollock, as usual, is doing excellent. They are our best two bowlers in these conditions. Pollocks experience is very handy for us. Thunderstorms hit the city immediately after the day-night match got over.  (PTI)  Copyright

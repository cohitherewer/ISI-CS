 Black Caps shoot down WI
 - MoM Andre Adams sets up 20-run win with allround effort  New Zealand players celebrate the dismissal of West Indies captain Carl Hooper in Port Elizabeth Thursday. (AP/PTI) Port Elizabeth : The West Indies Thursday suffered a 20-run defeat at the hands of a resurgent New Zealand in their World Cup group B match Thursday.  Having shocked fancied hosts South Africa in the tournament opener, the Caribbeans caved in to a persistent Black Cap pace attack chasing a target of 242. A late rally by Ramnaresh Sarwan (75) and Ridley Jacobs (50) could not lift the West Indies flagging fortunes. They were bowled out for 221 in 49.4 overs, with star batsman Brian Lara (2), failing to repeat his last-match heroics. In group B, South Africa, the West Indies and New Zealand have four points from two games while Lanka have four from one. West Indies suffered a dramatic collapse Thursday, which saw them lose five top wickets within a space of 12 runs. From comfortably cruising at 34 without loss in the 10th over, they nose-dived to 46 for five. Sarwan came up with a heroic knock and put on 98 for the seventh wicket with Jacobs but that was not enough. After their victory against South Africa, the West Indies went into the match as favourites and looked in control for most of the innings before wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum and Man of the Match Andre Adams ensured a competitive score for the Black Caps with their late charge. McCullum remained unbeaten on 36 while Adams remained not out after making 35 off 24 balls. The highest scorer of the New Zealand innings though, was Nathan Astle (46). Having defeated South Africa, the Caribbeans came into the match with a lot of confidence which was reflected in Hoopers decision to put the opposition in. In a surprise move, New Zealand, who suffered a huge loss to Sri Lanka in their opening match, sent Daniel Vettori to open the innings with skipper Stephen Fleming. The duo put on 42. The dismissal of Fleming, for a run-a-ball 25, slowed down the scoring and four overs later Vettori also got out as the West Indies slowly started to gain their grip on the match. When the Black Caps bowled, Cairns struggled to get his length right and was heavily punished by Sarwan and Powell. Sarwan hit him for three successive fours while Powell smashed a huge six to take 21 runs from the over. Cairns never bowled again in the match. (PTI)  Copyright

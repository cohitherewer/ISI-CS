(AFP) 																								Milan: AC Milan went three points clear at the top of Serie A on Sunday after coming from behind to beat Piacenza 2-1 but Inter were thrashed 4-1 by Perugia, losing their place as joint leaders.																								French international David Trezeguet scored a hattrick for Juventus in their 4-1 win at fifth-placed Chievo  a game which saw the Turin side awarded three penalties but AS Romas poor form continued with a 2-1 defeat at lowly Atalanta.																								With this Lazio leapfrogged Inter into second place by beating Udinese 2-1 at home with goals from Claudio Lopez and Stefano Fiore. Milan lead with 39 points with Lazio and Inter on 36 points and fourth-placed Juventus a point behind.																								Piacenzas Belarussian midfielder Sergei Gurenko score early in the second half. But Andrea Pirlo equalised within a minute and Rivaldo got Milans winner in the 69th minute.																								Perugia pulled off the days surprise by thumping Inter with first-half goals from Brazilian Ze Maria and Greek international Zisis Vryzas and two more in the second half from Massimiliano Fusani and Vryzas again. 																								But by the time Christian Vieri scored a late consolation penalty, Inter were 4-0 down and had been reduced to 10 men after Luigi di Biagio got a red card for a foul.																								At Verona, Trezeguet put Juventus ahead in the 11th minute. Nine minutes later Del Piero doubled their advantage from the penalty spot after Fabio Moro was ruled to have brought down Juve midfielder Pavel Nedved. Del Piero then provided a delightful pass for Trezeguet to rifle past Lupatelli in the 68th minute.																								Federico Cossato pulled a goal back for Cheivo in the 72nd minute but four minutes later teammate, German international Oliver Bierhoff was sent off for dissent.																								Trezeguet completed the rout and his hattrick from the third penalty in the 86th minute after Moro was harshly ruled to have fouled Juve substitute Marco Di Vaio.																								Fabio Capellos troubles at Roma show no signs of easing after another poor result despite Francesco Totti scoring the opening goal in the ninth minute. But Brazilian midfielder Emerson was sent off 12 minutes later and Atalanta drew level with a Cristiano Doni goal.																								The Bergamo-based side then took all the points to edge themselves out of the relegation zone when Paolo Tremazzani scored with three minutes to go.																								A meeting of the Serie As bottom two sides, Torino and Como, ended goalless. Modena and Brescia also drew 0-0. 																								Atletico draw Real																								In Madrid, Italian midfielder Demetrio Albertini scored five minutes into injury time to earn Atletico Madrid a 2-2 draw with Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Sunday.																								Real fell behind on 11 minutes to a Javi Moreno penalty and had centre-back Ivan Helguera sent off a minute later.																								The European champions made light of that double setback, however, taking the lead with two Luis Figo strikes, the second a penalty a minute before halftime. The numbers were evened up just past the hour mark when Jose Antonio Garcia Calvo was sent off for a foul on Figo and the game appeared to be up when Roberto Carlos won another penalty nine minutes from time.																								Figo saw his hattrick attempt saved by Mono Burgos, though, and Albertini clinched a deserved point for Atletico with a 25-metre free kick that squeezed past Iker Casillas and in at his top right-hand corner.																								Real are now three points behind leaders Real Sociedad, who won 1-0 at home to Celta Vigo on Saturday. (REUTERS)

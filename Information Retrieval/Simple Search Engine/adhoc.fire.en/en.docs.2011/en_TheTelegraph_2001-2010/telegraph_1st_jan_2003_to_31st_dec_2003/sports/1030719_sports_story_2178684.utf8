 Vaughan salutes F1 precision 
Silverstone: England one-day captain Michael Vaughan saluted the precision of Formula One racing here on Friday and said that his team could learn a lot from the sport. Vaughan, who led England to victory in the one-day series against South Africa and Zimbabwe last week, believes that the two sports have plenty in common. In any form of life you can learn by watching these guys, he said. We watched the Ferrari guys in the garage and the teamwork involved in the pits stops, the tyre changes and refuelling was incredible. The whole aspect of the work ethic, the effort involved and the whole idea of working together is something we can definitely work on. Vaughan was visiting the Ferrari team with Alec Stewart and James Anderson in a publicity link-up. But a career behind the wheel is not for Vaughan. I dont think theyd let me anywhere near the cars.

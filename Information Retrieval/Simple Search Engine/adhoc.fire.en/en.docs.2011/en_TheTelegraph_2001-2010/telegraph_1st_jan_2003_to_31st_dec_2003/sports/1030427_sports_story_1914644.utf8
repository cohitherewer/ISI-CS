The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Viji almost assured of title 
 Sasikiran lost to Dung, who extended his lead Mumbai, April 26 (PTI): WGM S. Vijayalakshmi (6.5) scored a sensational win over Chinese GM Zhang Peng Xiag (5.5) in the ninth and penultimate round of the Commonwealth chess meet on Saturday. She is almost assured of the womens title with a round to spare as her closest competitor D. Harika (5.5) squandered a promising position against Greek GM Vasilios Kotronios (6.5).  Vietnam GM Nguyen Anh Dung (8) scored a breathtaking  win over Asian champion K. Sasikiran (6) of India to surge  ahead in the mens field. GM Dibyendu Barua (7) outwitted Uzbek Marat Dzumaev (6) with white pieces. Barua needs just a draw in the last round to claim a medal.  Harika missed an opportunity to bag a gold when she went down fighting to Kotronios (6). Harika had a comfortable position and she missed several promising continuations against Kotronios. Sasikiran (6) tried to win a game from a position that would have earned him a draw at the most and paid when Dung won a couple of pawns. GMs Surya Sekhar Ganguly (6.5) and P. Harikrishna (6.5) kept within striking distance of Barua and have good chances of reaching the podium.

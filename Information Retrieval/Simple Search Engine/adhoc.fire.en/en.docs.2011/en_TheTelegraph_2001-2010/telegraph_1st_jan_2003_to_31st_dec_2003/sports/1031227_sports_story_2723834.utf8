The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shoaib wrecks Black Caps
 - SECOND TEST - Richardson (53 batting) in late steadying act for NZ 		 Shaoib Akhtar in action at the Basin Reserve  on Friday. (Reuters)Wellington: New Zealand fought back from a vicious spell of pace bowling by Pakistan express bowler Shoaib Akhtar to be 151 for five at stumps on the first day of the second Test at the Basin Reserve here Thursday. Shoaib, in his comeback game after missing the first Test with a hamstring strain, finished the day with the remarkable figures of three for 14 off 11 overs, after having New Zealand at two wickets for one run at one stage. However, there were concerns about his fitness at the end of the day when he developed a limp just before stumps and did not bowl the last over as expected. After a shaky start, the ever-diligent Mark Richardson anchored the New Zealand recovery to be unbeaten on 53 at stumps with Robbie Hart on three. Bowling with a howling northerly at his back and reaching speeds of up to 156 kmph (96.7 mph), Shoaib had both Lou Vincent and Stephen Fleming back in the pavilion without scoring, and followed up with the wicket of Scott Styris. Vincent had no chance when a scorching full-length delivery shot between bat and pad. It was the New Zealand openers third failure of the series after scores of eight and four in Hamilton. Captain Fleming, who won the toss and chose to bat first on what appeared a good batting pitch, had a scare off his first ball when Shoaibs confident leg before shout was turned down by umpire Asoka de Silva. He survived two more balls before the rain set in, and when play resumed nearly three hours later he was out first ball for his second consecutive duck after amassing 192 in the first innings of the first Test. Abdul Razzaq had New Zealand at 41 for three when Test debutant Richard Jones, a late inclusion after all rounder Chris Cairns pulled out with a virus, chopped the ball on to his stumps to be dismissed for 16. At the other end Richardson battled on, leading the Black Caps recovery with a 53-run partnership with Styris then a 51-run combination with Craig McMillan to give New Zealand a modicum of respectability. Styris went soon after tea, getting a touch to a flyer from Shoaib which wicketkeeper Moin Khan took before his eyes. McMillan was unlucky and showed his disapproval when given out leg before to Shabbir Ahmed with television replays showing an inside edge before the ball hit the pads. But Pakistan were equally annoyed when Shoaib was denied Robbie Harts wicket. Replays showed the ball come off Harts gloves and Khan took a superb catch down the leg side.  (AFP)  Copyright

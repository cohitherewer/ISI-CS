The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bologan champion, Anand joint second
 Anand was level with Kramnik Dortmund: Viswanathan Anand had to be content with joint second after settling for a quick draw in the tenth and final round of the Dortmund Chess Championship on Sunday. Viktor Bologan of Moldova held Braingames champion Vladimir Kramnik of Russia to his maiden title in the super-category event. Bologan, who qualified for this meet after winning the Aeroflot Open in Moscow, came up with an excellent performance in the first half of the tournament that yielded him four points from the five games. Thereafter, a 50 percent score in the second half, including his only loss against Anand, was enough for the Moldovan to romp home. Bologan ended up with an impressive tally of 6.5 while both Kramnik and Anand managed 5.5. The fourth place went to Grandmaster Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan (5) while Hungarian Peter Leko and German Arkadi Naiditsch finished fifth and sixth respectively tallying four and 3.5 respectively. On Sunday, Anand didnt go all guns blazing against Radjabov, who had beaten him in the second round. Playing black this time, Anand faced the queen pawn opening and employed the Bogo Indian defence. The opening choice proved correct as Radjabov did not get any advantage and following exchange of three minor pieces by the 13th move, the draw was agreed upon. I just played sensible chess, and nothing rash, Anand said, adding overall I am happy about the event, starting with minus two, then winning three in a row, and finishing plus one. Radjabov said he was surprised at Anands choice of the Bogo Indian. Bologan had to work hard as Kramnik wanted to catch up with him. Though the Moldovan was playing black, his confidence was quite high. Kramnik was up against the Nimzo Indian but did not muster any advantage despite going for opposite side castling. Bologan maintained a pleasant position till the end and after 37 moves, Kramnik proposed the draw. Terming this performance as his career best, Bologan said: Finishing ahead of Kramnik, Vishy and Leko is a high feeling.  Final standings 1. Bologan (6.5); 2. Kramnik amp; Anand (5.5); 4. Radjabov (5); 5. Leko (4); 6. Naiditsch (3.5).  (PTI)  Copyright

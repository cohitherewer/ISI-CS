				 																																	London: World No. 4 Lindsay Davenport underwent surgery on her left foot on Wednesday and will miss the remainder of the 2003 season, the WTA said.				 																																	The former US Open and Wimbledon champion is expected to be sidelined for up to eight weeks after she had an operation to rectify a pinched toe nerve that had been bothering her throughout the year.				 																																	The surgery rules her out of the season-ending WTA Championships in Los Angeles next month. Im very disappointed that I wont be able to play in the WTA Tour Championships, which is a prestigious tournament and an important one for me because its in my hometown, the American said in a statement. 				 																																	London: English Premiership side Tottenham Hotspurs have turned down a chance to sign Brazil World Cup star Rivaldo from European champions AC Milan.

AC Milan  who want him off their wage bill  agreed to a 5 million ($8 million) pay-off and to cancel his contract, which would make him a free agent. Rivaldos agent has been trying to strike the deal. But the club has spent all their transfer budget. 				 																																	London: Everton have denied English Premiership leaders Chelsea have made a 35 million ($58 million) bid for 17-year-old England striker Wayne Rooney. We have had no contact with Chelsea or from any other club regarding Wayne Rooney and nor would we welcome any, said Evertons head of corporate affairs and PR Ian Ross. Rooney signed a contract with Everton in January which runs until June 2006 and has been linked with an improved deal. 				 																																	The Sun claimed a Chelsea representative held unofficial talks with Rooneys agents last week. Chelsea, who went top of the Premiership on Wednesday following a 0-0 draw at Birmingham, have already spent more than 100 million on players since Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich took over the club in June. 				 																																	Rome: AC Milan defender Paolo Maldini has ruled out a return to the Italian national team for the European Championships in Portugal next year.				 																																	Italy coach Giovanni Trapattoni said earlier this week that he hoped Maldini could be persuaded to come back to the Azzurri.				 																																	But the 35-year-old, who won 126 caps before retiring from international football at the end of the 2002 World Cup, said they he had not discussed a possible return. I havent spoken to Trapattoni for almost six months.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Matter of seconds for Tyson
 Mike Tyson walks off the ring after knocking out Clifford Etienne in Memphis Saturday. (AP/PTI) Memphis: Mike Tyson scored the emphatic victory he needed Saturday, knocking out Clifford Etienne in the opening seconds of the first round of their scheduled 10-round heavyweight bout. The stunning win paves the way for a rematch with champion Lennox Lewis. His performance appeared to impress everyone but himself, the former-undisputed champion saying he wasnt interested in an immediate rematch needing more fights and time to get his career and life together. Im more confident now then I was last year, Tyson said. But Im not interested in getting beaten up again, I need two or three more fights. Im going back to the gym next week. Real fighters need to go more rounds, knockouts are exciting but I need more rounds. If I want to beat Lennox Lewis I need to be more active. Im hungry, but hungry isnt enough to beat consummate professionals. Tyson, who did not train for a week threatening to call off the fight claiming he had the flu, looked sharp and focused needing just 49 seconds to finish the Black Rhino with a ferocious right to remain unbeaten in non-title bouts. Wearing his familiar black trunks and a simple white towel draped over his shoulders, Tyson, his much talked about tattoo in full view, was greeted by a thunderous ovation from the near sell-out crowd. Showing glimpses of the brutal power and menacing mystique that made him the most feared fighter of his generation, the 36-year-old charged across the ring with urgency at the opening bell, searching for the early knockout.

 Kunte upset in Round I
Hastings (England): Indian Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte was shocked by GM Mark Hebden of England in the opening round of the Hastings International Chess Congress here. Kunte, who boasts of a good personal score against Hebden, missed out on a promising position and was gradually outplayed in the endgame. Top seed GM Vladimir Epishin used his immense experience to easily outplay youngest participant IM Kateryna Lahno, 14, of Ukraine and emerged as the early leader along with Hebden and International Master Alexander Cherniaev of Russia in this 10-player contest, played on all-play-all basis. The opening day featured three decisive games out of a possible five. Opting for a fashionable variation in the Ruy Lopez, Kunte got an attacking position to his liking and looked well set to start his campaign on a high. Though Hebden was pushed to the wall on the king side, the Indian star failed to keep the momentum ticking and blundered away the advantage by going for simplifications. Once on top, Hebden consolidated his position by winning a pawn using resourceful technique. Kunte called it a day after prolonging the battle till move 72. Epishin was a class act as he crushed Lahno in style. The Russian faced the Queens Indian defence by Lahno, who played black, and got a tangible advantage after trading the queens early in the middle game. Improving his position move by move thereafter, Epishin offered little respite to his younger rival and steered the game to a winning rook and pawn endgame. Lahno resigned after 59 moves. In the duel between two IMs, Alexander Cherniaev of Russia outplayed local hope Daniel Gormally in a keenly contested game.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka A win
Mumbai: Left-hand batsman Tilana Kandamby slammed an unbeaten half-century to steer Sri Lanka A to a three-wicket win on the penultimate day of the third and final Test with India A at the Brabourne Stadium on Monday. The teams thus shared honours in the series, India A having won the second match. Resuming today at six for no loss, the visitors made heavy weather of a modest 153-run target and lost five wickets for 57 runs. Anushka Polonowita (22) and Kandamby (63 not out) steadied the rocking boat with a 53-run partnership for the sixth wicket. Polonowita was dropped by substitute S. Sriram at slips off left-arm spinner Murali Kartik when on eight, with the total on 78 for five. (PTI)  Copyright

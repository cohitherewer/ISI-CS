 Sourav improving satisfactorily 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sourav Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly, who underwent a second surgery on his left upper thigh region to cure an abscess, is improving satisfactorily, according to a medical bulletin issued by a city clinic. Sourav is cheerful and taking daily walks in his room, doctors said on Tuesday. Dressing continued to be done under anaesthesia and its still not clear when he will be discharged. The pain seems to have reduced considerably, Pradip Tondon, administrator of Belle Vue Clinic where Sourav was admitted on Saturday, said. According to the doctors on the medical panel set up to supervise Souravs treatment, the regular Team India skippers leucocyte count, which was much above normal when he was admitted, has come down. The count is now near normal, Dr Sukumar Mukherjee said. The doctors are awaiting the blood culture report, which is expected on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will bear the entire expenditure for Souravs treatment. We will foot all the bills. We want that he should get the best possible treatment, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said. State sports minister Subhas Chakraborty and national selector Pranab Roy visited Sourav at the clinic.

		 Monday, April 21, 2003  Bookies Delight scrapes home 
 BY HONKY DORY				 	 Lalvani				 										Capitalising on chances coming his way in view of poor handling of Singita (by Chowksey Ruzaan), fellow jockey K. P. Appu guided the course-favourite Bookies Delight to a neck victory in the 2,800m Byculla Club Trophy at the Mumbai races held on Sunday. Nina Lalvani trained the six-year-old mare by Placerville out of Abidance. The afternoon was, however, ruled by lesser fancied horses and Protege, in the J. D. amp; Peggy Banatwalla Trophy, was the only other favourite to win.RESULTS				 										(With inter-state dividends)				 										1.

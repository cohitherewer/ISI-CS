 Ronaldo doubtful for 2nd leg
Madrid: Real Madrids star striker Ronaldo will miss his teams league match this weekend and is doubtful for next weeks Champions League semi-final second leg against Juventus, it was learnt Wednesday. The Brazilian strained a muscle in his left calf during Reals 2-1 victory over Juventus in Tuesdays first leg at Santiago Bernabeu stadium and was replaced in the 50th minute. There is a 90 per cent chance that he will not be able to play in the game against Juventus, said Reals chief of medical staff Alfonso del Corral. But we will be working hard with the remaining 10 per cent in the hope that we can get him ready in time.  (AP)  Copyright

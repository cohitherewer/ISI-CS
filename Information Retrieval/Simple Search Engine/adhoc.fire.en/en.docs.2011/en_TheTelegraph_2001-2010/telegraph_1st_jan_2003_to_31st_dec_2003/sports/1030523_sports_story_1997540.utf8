 Yuvraj stumbles on County debut 
London: It was a none-too-happy County debut for Indias Yuvraj Singh as he made just 11 runs for Yorkshire on the opening day of its four-day County Championship game against Glamorgan at Headingley. Batting at number 3, Yuvraj, playing barely 24 hours after landing from India, lasted just 14 balls. But the one-day specialist did provide a tantalising glimpse of his stroke-play, drawing warm applause for a sumptuous square drive, before he edged Mike Kasprowicz to slip. Yorkshire managed to make 190 for nine, thanks to contributions from Gary Fellows (53) and Michael Lumb (39). Yuvrajs teammate Virender Sehwag too fared poorly. Playing for Leicestershire, Sehwag was out for 10 to leave his team struggling at 19 for three while replying to Middlesexs 201 in a rain-hit tie. The swashbuckling batsman, however, has played a couple of good knocks in the last two matches.  (PTI)  Copyright

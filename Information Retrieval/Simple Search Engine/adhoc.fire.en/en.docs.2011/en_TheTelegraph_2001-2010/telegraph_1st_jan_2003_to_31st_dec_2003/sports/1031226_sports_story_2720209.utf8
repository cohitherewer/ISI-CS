The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Great to perform vs Pak
 - Amit Bhandari named Man-of-the-Match  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Amit Bhandari celebrates a wicket at the Eden. Pictures by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Amit Bhandaris international debut, in the 2001 Asia Cup in Dhaka, was tarnished by a brutal assault on him by the Pakistani batsmen. On Thursday at Eden Gardens, the medium-pacer made a good comeback by bagging the MoM award in the India A-Pakistan A tri-series match. Its great to get a chance to prove myself against Pakistan. The ball was doing a bit in the early overs and I just tried to keep it in the right spot, said the Delhi speedster. Pakistans lone warrior Naveed Latif said he was confident of taking the team to 264, which would have stopped the Indians from bagging the bonus point. I was just thinking of batting for 50 overs. In between you do get some big overs, which could have taken us towards 264. But the others succumbed.  The Lankan plan Sri Lanka A may bring in a spin-bowling allrounder for Fridays match against India A. Tilina Kandamy may be the man. Though not mentioning any name, coach Hemantha Devapriya said the wickets may have suffered a bit of wear and tear and they are thinking of making one change in the XI. Even if it has not been confirmed, there is a chance that batsman Chamara Silva, who is also an off-spinner, may lose his place if another player is brought in.  Copyright

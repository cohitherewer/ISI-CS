The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Germany look to dominate group 
London: The majority of European leagues have ended for the summer but the international calendar is no respecter of holidays with 37 Euro 2004 qualifiers scheduled for the next ten days. After 19 games next Saturday and another 18 the following Wednesday the qualification picture should start to look much clearer, with most teams down to their last two or three fixtures. Having failed to impress in any of their three qualifiers three-time champions Germany will be looking to take a stranglehold of group V by beating Scotland and the Faroe Islands in two away games. Germany, Scotland and Lithuania are on seven points but the Germans, held to a 1-1 home draw by Lithuania last time out after scraping a to 2-1 home win over the Faroes, have games in hand. They warmed up with an easy 4-1 win over Canada on Sunday but will be wary of Scotland, managed by their former coach Berti Vogts.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Lawson review report by Aug. 1
St Johns (Antigua): The West Indies Cricket Board said on Friday that it will submit a review of fast bowler Jermaine Lawsons action to the International Cricket Council by August 1. The 21-year-old Jamaicans action was reported during the fourth Test against Australia in Antigua in May. He has not played since May 13, when he took a career-best seven for 78 against the Aussies and aggravated a disc injury in his lower back. Jermaine has been carrying along very well with the remedial programme in Jamaica, said Michael Seepersaud, the regional boards chief development officer, who is supervising the review process. The back problems that set back the remedial work on his bowling action is now over, he is free from pain, and substantial progress has been made to ensure his allround bio-mechanical efficiency. Next week, the WICB plan to fly in bio-mechanics specialist Dr Paul Hurrion from Britain to conduct an assessment of the way Lawson uses his elbow when bowling. Once we have his analysis of Jermaine, we will convene the bowling committee and send our review to the ICC for their consideration. Lawson has taken 29 wickets at 24.31 runs apiece in seven Tests. Against the Australians, he took a hattrick in the third Test in Barbados. (AP)  Copyright

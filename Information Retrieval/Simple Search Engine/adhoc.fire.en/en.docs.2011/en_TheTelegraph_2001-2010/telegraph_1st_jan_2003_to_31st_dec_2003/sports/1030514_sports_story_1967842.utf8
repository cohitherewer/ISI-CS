New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked the government to allow the team to play a one-day game in Pakistan in September, ending the freeze in bilateral matches between the two nations. Our proposal is to have a one-day match between India and Pakistan in Pakistan sometime in the third or fourth week of September, followed by a one-day match in India shortly thereafter, BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya said in a letter to sports minister Vikram Verma.

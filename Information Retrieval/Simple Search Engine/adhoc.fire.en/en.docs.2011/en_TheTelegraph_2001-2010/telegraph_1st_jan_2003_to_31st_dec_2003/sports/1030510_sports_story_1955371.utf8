 Pak now ready to play host 
Islamabad: Amid peace overtures, Pakistan on Friday said it would host the cancelled ninth South Asian Federation Games in Islamabad in the hope that India will send its team to the regional competition. The thrice postponed and then cancelled SAF Games would be held in Pakistan, Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali told reporters. Pakistan had last month cancelled the Games following Indias reluctance to take part. But after his telephone conversation with Indian Prime Minster Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Jamali said it was decided to conduct the Games here as planned earlier with the hope that India would take part.

 Anil Kumble bowling wrong line: Prasanna
Chennai: Legendary spinner Erapalli Prasanna said Friday that Anil Kumble has lost his rhythm because of bowling a wrong line. However, the former off-spinner said he was confident that Kumble would return to his best during the home series against New Zealand. Kumble is a world class spinner like Muthiah Muralidharan and Shane Warne. But currently, he has changed his line. He is working hard and being such a classy spinner, he will definitely be back. Prasanna felt that in recent times, Kumble has allowed batsmen to take liberties. But the day is not far when Kumble will recover, in time for the New Zealand series. (PTI)  Copyright

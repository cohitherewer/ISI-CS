The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harrington in lead
 Padraig Harrington of Ireland in action Friday. (AFP) Ponte Vedra Beach (Florida), March 29 (Reuters): Padraig Harrington took advantage of calm conditions to claim the second-round lead in the $6.5 million Players Championship Friday. The Irishmans four-under par 68 gave him a nine-under total of 135 and a two-shot cushion over 1997 US PGA winner Davis Love III, defending champion Craig Perks of New Zealand and Skip Kendall when play was suspended with 27 players still on the course. Fred Couples, Jay Haas, Rocco Mediate and Australias Adam Scott were on 138. World No. 1 Tiger Woods flirted with the halfway cut mark until he made three birdies in four holes to finish with a 70 for 142, two-under.  Copyright

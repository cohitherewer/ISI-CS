		 Tuesday, January 07, 2003 				 Steve: SA know deep down we are better
																								Sydney: Rival captains Steve Waugh and Nasser Hussain are unanimous: Australia are the best side in world cricket.																								Englands comeback 225-run victory in the fifth Ashes Test here Monday coincided with South Africas move to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings, courtesy a 2-0 series win against Pakistan.																								Waugh said Australia remained No.1 and South Africa knew it, although he conceded Shaun Pollocks men had achieved the difficult feat of beating India in their own backyard in 2000.																								South Africa deep down would know that were a better cricket side than them, said Waugh, whose team thumped the Proteas 3-0 in Australia and 3-1 in South Africa in an unofficial world championship series last year.																								Thats not being big-headed, thats being realistic, although from their point of view they can say theyve won in the sub-continent, which we havent.																								So maybe there is some sense in the rankings.																								If theyve done that, its a great achievement, but I think if you beat a side five times out of six in recent times and theyre ranked ahead of you, that seems a bit strange.																								Australia regards India as the final frontier for undisputed world domination after losing a sensational series 1-2 in 2001.																								Englands dominant performance at the Sydney Cricket Ground was Australias first Test loss at home in four years.																								Australia won a world record 16 straight Tests between 1999 and 2001 and has won the Ashes eight consecutive times since 1989. It hasnt lost a home series for ten years.																								If theyre not the best side in the world then weve got problems, said Hussain. All I can go on is my opinion and this side is the best side Ive ever played against.																								Australia won the Ashes series 4-1, and Waugh and Hussain both averaged 38 with the bat over the five Tests. 																								I think the guys were a bit flat going into this game, Waugh said after the final Ashes Test.																								I think now, the players going to the World Cup, its more about man management, not overplaying them now and making sure that theyre peaking for the World Cup, Waugh said.																								Thats where theyre going to be judged ... They will be judged on this next series but the most important series obviously is the World Cup. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Close finish on the cards
Chennai: The TNGF-Kone Open golf championship, the third round of the Hero Honda Tour, is heading for a close finish with Digvijay Singh moving just a stroke behind leader Mukesh Kumar. Digvijay played a superb six-under 66 in the penultimate round on Friday and almost caught up with Mukesh who carded a three-under par 69 for a tally of 201. Arjun Singh had 204 and Uttam Singh Mundy 206. Digvijay began with a birdie but lost a shot on the second. Hitting his second shot with a three-iron, he landed in the rough on the left. He had a bad lie and hence his chip went over the green. After chipping again, he missed a 5-footer to go over for that hole. Apart from that, the lad from Meerut played flawless golf. The best of his six other birdies came on the par-5 seventh. After just about making it to the green, Digvijay sank a 30-footer for a birdie. The 31-year-old pro finished with a hat trick of birdies.

 Bengal make 262 
Silchar: Bengal were all out for 262 on the first day of the three-day under-19 Coochbehar Trophy tie against Assam here. Electing to bat, Bengal opener Subhojit Pal attacked from the very beginning and top-scored with 83 before being caught by Vishal Jain off Chandan Rawat. The other notable scorers for Bengal were Parathasarathi Bhattacharjee (47) and keeper Wriddhiman Saha (31 n.o.). (PTI)  Copyright

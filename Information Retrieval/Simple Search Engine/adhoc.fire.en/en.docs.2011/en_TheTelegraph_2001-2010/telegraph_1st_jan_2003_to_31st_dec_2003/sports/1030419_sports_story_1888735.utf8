The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nehra recovery to be a month quicker
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 		 NEHRA: Happy that surgery  is overCalcutta: Ashish Nehra, who underwent surgery on his right ankle Thursday, should recover around a month quicker than expected. For Indian cricket and Nehra himself, thats excellent news. The left-arm quick, after all, has become somewhat indispensable after a significant role in Indias World Cup final-reaching campaign. Thankfully, the hour-long surgery wasnt as complicated as feared. Moreover, the best in the business (Dr Sise Perreira) wielded the scalpel, informed Team India physio Andrew Leipus, when contacted by The Telegraph in Johannesburg, Friday evening. He added: Accordingly, the surgeon has scaled down Nehras recovery period from five-six months to four-five... Though Nehras international comeback will still be in the home series against New Zealand, he will surely have more time to get fit for the big league grind. Leipus, who drove across to Pretoria (45 minutes from JoBurg) in the morning, spent a couple of hours with Nehra at the Little Company of Mary Hospital. Look, emotions-wise, Nehra is always the same But, yes, he is happy that the (posterior impingement) surgery has been done with. Now, he is looking forward to being discharged Saturday and recuperating at a friends place in JoBurg, Leipus, who isnt in Dhaka because of wife Sues mishap, remarked. The date of Nehras return home, however, hasnt been finalised. He turns 24 on April 29. According to Leipus, Nehra isnt in any pain. He will, of course, be on crutches for three-four weeks. As things stand, Nehra will undergo about six weeks of therapy once the plaster is removed. After that will be around six weeks of closely monitored rehab. About 15-16 weeks from now, then, he should be able to start light workouts, Leipus pointed out. Incidentally, Nehra is the latest among prominent quicks  others being Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock and Chaminda Vaas  to be operated upon by the top-notch foot specialist.  Copyright

																								Paris: Veteran sprinter Merlene Ottey will make her return to the track at the age of 42 in the international indoor meeting in the Belgian city of Ghent, organisers said Tuesday.																								The Jamaican-born athlete, now competing for Slovenia, will compete in a top-quality 60m which also includes world 100m champion Zhanna Pintusevich and European 200m champion Muriel Hurtis.																								Ottey raced little last year leading to speculation she was about to call time on a career in which she has won 34 major championship medals.																								A knee injury forced her to miss the outdoor European athletics championships in Munich last year after she had been cleared to compete for her adopted country.  (AP)

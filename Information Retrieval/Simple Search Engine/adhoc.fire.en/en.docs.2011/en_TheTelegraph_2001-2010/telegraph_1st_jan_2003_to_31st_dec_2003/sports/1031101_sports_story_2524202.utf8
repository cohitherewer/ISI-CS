The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Alvito cleared for play-off final
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: While Mohun Bagan are reeling under the setback of injured Jose Ramirez Barretos non-availability, there is some good news for East Bengal ahead of Sundays CFL Super Division play-off final. The red-and-gold brigades forward Alvito DCunha will be in the thick of action during that match, thanks to necessary clearance from the AIFF. The availability of Alvito for the play-off tie was thrown into confusion following the marching order he had received during East Bengals last match  the IFA Shield final against the same opponent. As a rule, a red-carded player has to sit out in the immediate match. The AIFF informed the IFA on Friday that the players case will be dealt with in accordance with the state associations prevailing rule  which does not carry forward a players punishment to the next tournament. Expressing elation at the news, an East Bengal official informed Alvito is match-fit and will be available for Sundays high-voltage clash. Meanwhile, the champions and runners-up trophies will be awarded on the ground itself. The IFA is also planning to inject a bout of innovativeness with regard to the match. A Bengali musical band will be present in the stadium to cheer the players. They will also create some specially-designed musical effects during key moments of the match  like goal, a missed chance or a foul. Ever-Ready plan Ever-Ready, who have finished fourth in the League, are planning to feature in the Durand Cup. They have already appealed to the tournament organisers in this regard and waiting for a reply. We are really looking forward to this tournament. It has a distinct charm and importance and well really honoured if given a chance to play in it, a club official said.  Copyright

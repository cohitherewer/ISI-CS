 Stuttgart keeper surpasses Kahn 
Berlin, Oct. 4 (AFP): VfB Stuttgart keeper Timo Hildebrand rewrote the Bundesliga history books on Saturday as he broke Oliver Kahns mark of 802 minutes without conceding a goal. Stuttgart drew 0-0 with Cologne, enough for the 24-year-old to break the record of Bayern keeper Kahn with 825 minutes unbeaten. Hildebrand has, therefore, not been beaten in more than nine Bundesliga matches  eight this season  with his last goal conceded in the penultimate round of last seasons matches.  Copyright

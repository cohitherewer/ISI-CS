 Bangladesh restrict England to 295
 Englands Marcus Trescothick celebrates after his century in Dhaka on Thursday. (Reuters) Dhaka: Bangladesh bowlers Mashrafe Mortaza and Mohammad Rafique took three wickets each as England were dismissed for 295 on the third day of the first Test on Thursday. A major power failure then caused the floodlights to fail, bringing an early end to play with Bangladesh on 12 for one in the second innings, 80 runs behind the touring side. Rajin Saleh was the man out for eight, caught by wicketkeeper Chris Read after he gloved a rising ball from Steve Harmison. Earlier, Bangladesh seamer Mortaza grabbed figures of three for 41, making good use of the new ball. Spinner Rafique took three for 84, wrapping up the England innings when Ashley Giles top-edged a paddle sweep and was well caught by a diving Tapash Baisya at silly mid-off. Harmison was out for a duck when he missed a Mortaza full toss and was adjudged leg before wicket. Graham Thorpe fell for 64 to the last delivery of the afternoon session, fending off a short ball by Mortaza to Rajin Saleh in the gully. Mortaza also dismissed Gareth Batty for 19 when the England debutant edged a catch to wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud. Marcus Trescothick earlier completed his fifth Test century before falling for 113, caught by captain Khaled Mahmud at square leg to give 16-year-old spinner Enamul Hoque Jr a first Test wicket on his debut. It has been hard work, we have had to graft today, Trescothick said. We will have to do the same tomorrow and be very positive and knock them over cheaply. Hoque also accounted for Read, who edged a catch to wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud for one. Moments earlier, allrounder Rikki Clarke was out for 14 when he misjudged Mohammad Rafiques arm ball and allowed it to hit his off-stump. England lost three wickets for three runs after cruising to 137 without loss.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

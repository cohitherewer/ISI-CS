The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barua at his best now
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Dibyendu Baruas rise to a career-best 2561 points on the Elo rating list is the only talking point for India and nobody else has made any significant progress in the latest Fide list released this month. The city GM has gained a handy 16 points (over his April rating of 2545) to better his previous best of 2555 and most of these points have come from his success at the Commonwealth Championship. Baruas next  and probably his final  aim is to reach 2600. Koneru Humpys slide following her GM title continues and she finds herself at a moderate 2468 after losing 28 points. GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly has lost seven to come down to 2535 and he may lose more after a disappointing world junior meet. Barua, hard-pressed these days juggling his career as a player with academy commitments, will leave for Scotland next week for the British Championship. Im trying to play in some tournaments in Austria and Germany after that, he said Friday. Barua had reached 2555 twice earlier  in 1991 and around 96-97. At the moment, he is ranked fourth in India behind Viswanathan Anand (2774) and Krishnan Sasikiran (2654), who has lost four points to slip to No. 40 in the world. After the trip to Europe, Baruas next chance to push towards 2600 will come in Delhi and Jamshedpur  in two international open GM tournaments.  Copyright

 Carlos denies attack on referee
Madrid: Brazil defender Roberto Carlos has denied making an assault on the referee during Saturdays friendly international against Portugal. The Real Madrid full-back was sent off in the 82nd minute of his countrys 2-1 defeat after appearing to shoulder charge Israeli referee Alon Yefet in protest over the award of a free kick to Portugal. Spanish newspapers have speculated that Carlos could be given a worldwide ban that would stop him from playing for Real Madrid, as well as for Brazil, but the player defended his actions after arriving back in Spain. I didnt see it as an act of aggression, he said in an interview with Spanish sports daily Marca on Monday. Like a lot of players, I was saying to the referee that the free kick looked a bit harsh. It may have been that I was a bit heated but I never went to push him or to head-butt him. Ive never attacked anyone, whether a rival player or a referee, in any game Ive played. Those who know me know that I respect fair play. Ive been around long enough to know whats an act of aggression. On the possibility of suspension from Fifa, he added: Im calm and Im confident this wont be turned into a big drama. World soccers governing body have handed out worldwide bans to players involved in clear acts of aggression against referees. In a recent high-profile case, Portugal midfielder Joao Pinto was suspended from all matches for four months for punching Argentine referee Angel Sanchez in the stomach in a World Cup match against South Korea last year.

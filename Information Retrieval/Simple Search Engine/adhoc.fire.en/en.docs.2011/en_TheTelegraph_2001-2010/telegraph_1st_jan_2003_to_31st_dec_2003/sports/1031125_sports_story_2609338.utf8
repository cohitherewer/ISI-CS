 - EURO ROUND-UP - Roma win 4-0 to stay within two points of leaders Juventus  Real Madrids Michel Salgado, Solari and David Beckham (left to right) jump on Zinedine Zidane after the Frenchman scored the second goal against Albacete on Sunday. (Reuters) London: Real Madrid took over at the top of the Primera Liga from Deportivo Coruna on Sunday as Europes leading clubs Juventus, Arsenal, Vfb Stuttgart and Monaco all won to preserve first place in their domestic championships. Real Madrid went top when lowly Albacete succumbed 1-2 after a late headed winner from Zinedine Zidane seven minutes from time after England captain David Beckham had put them ahead with a spectacular strike seven minutes before the break. Valencias chances of drawing level on 26 points with Real and second-placed Deportivo, who lost top spot after being held to a goalless draw by a dominant Real Betis on Saturday, disappeared when they were held 2-2 at bottom club Murcia. Rafa Benitezs Valencia side took the lead when Mista slotted home on 13 minutes but last seasons second division champions hit back with goals from Richi and Michel either side of halftime before Mista struck again with a fine header. AS Roma enjoyed a 4-0 win at Bologna on Sunday to stay within two points of Serie A leaders Juventus, who won 2-0 at Modena on Saturday, after 10 games. Andriy Shevchenko scored both goals for European champions AC Milan in their 2-0 win at Chievo taking his seasons tally to 10 goals. Milan are third but level on 24 points with Roma. Inter Milan are in fourth place after their 6-0 victory over Reggina on Saturday but there were ugly scenes as Lazio beat Perugia 3-1 to move up one place to fifth. Four players  Souleymane Diamoutene, Giovanni Ignoffo and Marco di Loreto from Perugia and Lazios Sergio Conceicao  were sent off along with Perugia coach Serse Cosmi. Monaco remained three points clear at the top of Ligue 1 after a 2-0 win over RC Lens in a match lit up by a sumptuous goal. Jerome Rothens centre found Ludovic Giuly who flipped into the air to volley home right-footed at shoulder height. The midfielder then turned provider for Fernando Morientes 10 minutes later, beating three defenders to cross for the Spanish striker to head home at the far post after 68 minutes. Defending champions Olympique Lyon have 30 points after beating Racing Strasbourg 1-0 on Friday. In Germany, leaders VfB Stuttgart beat Hanover 96 3-1 to remain the only unbeaten team in the Bundesliga after 13 matches as they opened up a two-point lead. Silvio Meissner scored twice after Imre Szabics had put them in front for their eighth consecutive home win. Bayer Leverkusen, a point behind ahead of the weekend, were held to a 2-2 draw at Borussia Dortmund and Werder Bremen jumped above them into second after a 3-1 win at home to Vfl Bochum. Bayern Munich scraped a 1-0 victory over cross-town rivals TSV 1860 in front of a derby crowd of 69,000 to stay in fourth place six points behind the leaders. Roy Makaay scored his seventh goal of the season for Bayern from their only first-half shot on target but it took an impressive save by goalkeeper Oliver Kahn late in the match from a Benjamin Lauth shot to prevent 1860 from earning the draw.

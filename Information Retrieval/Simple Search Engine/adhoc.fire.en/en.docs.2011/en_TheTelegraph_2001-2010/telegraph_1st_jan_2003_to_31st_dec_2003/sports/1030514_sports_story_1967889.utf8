 Vialli seeks coaching job in Italy
 Vialli Milan: Former Italy striker and ex-Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli says he would be interested in coaching in Italy, even in the lower divisions.Vialli has been out of the game since he was sacked as manager of English first division club Watford last June and though he has been linked with several jobs in Italy his lack of a coaching certificate would make it difficult for him to work in his homeland.But the former Juventus striker said he intends beginning a coaching course in November in order to get the necessary paperwork and avoid the controversy that surrounded Lazio coach Roberto Mancinis move onto the bench before gaining his badge.Naturally I want to work as a coach and to do so without provoking the kind of row that happened to Mancini, Vialli told an Italian news agency Monday.That is why in November I will be starting the course at Coverciano, added Vialli, referring to the Italian Football Federations training centre on the outskirts of Florence.Vialli said he was ready to take on a job with a small club if they were ambitious.Up to now I havent received any offers but I would consider approaches from lower division clubs  the important thing is that there is a serious plan. I have worked in the English second flight so why wouldnt I do the same in Italy? I learnt a lot over the Channel, now I would like to show what I am worth.Lazio coach Mancini took over at Fiorentina while still studying for his badge and prompted a fierce row among members of the Italian coachs union.Vialli ended his playing career in Englands Premier League with Chelsea before taking over as manager of the London club in February 1998.During his two and a half years in charge he guided the club to the FA Cup, the League Cup and the European Cup Winners Cup.Vialli was in charge of Watford in the English first division for the 2001-2002 season.

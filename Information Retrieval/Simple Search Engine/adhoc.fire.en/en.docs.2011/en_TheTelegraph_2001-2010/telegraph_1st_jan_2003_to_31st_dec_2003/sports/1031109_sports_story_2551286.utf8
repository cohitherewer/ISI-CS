The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pakistan trip enriches Sarkar 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 8: Watching Aaqib Javed from close, tips from Robin Singh and a lesson in what adjustments one has to make to do well at the international level have been the gains for Sourav Sarkar, a member of the victorious India under-19 team in Pakistan. The Bengal medium-pacer returned home on Saturday morning, richer in experience. Sarkar played just one of the four and went for 20-odd in three overs. International cricket demands a difference in attitude. It means there is more responsibility, said Sarkar Sarkar said the reception the Indians got in Pakistan was remarkable, despite being under the constant vigil of securitymen. About advice from coach Robin, Sarkar said: He told us to check the wides and no-balls as we invariably ended up conceding 20-25 extra runs in each match. Though Sarkar got to meet former Pakistan quick Aaqib, who was the coach of the home team, he didnt find the time to pick up tips from him.

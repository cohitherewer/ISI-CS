The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No Indians tested after Paarl
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  SRINATH Pietermaritzburg: The International Cricket Council (ICC) decision to introduce dope tests in the World Cup not only made cricketers wary, but got the Boards to take precautionary steps. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), for instance, had two tests done  in New Zealand and in Mumbai  before the squad landed in South Africa. Of course, this isnt to suggest there has been substance abuse on the quiet  though questions continue to be raised after the Shane Warne scandal  but everyone has been keen to have a clean record. After all, even careless medication can invite big trouble. According to The Telegraphs sources, only two Indians have been tested in the three games till date. The players in question are Jawagal Srinath and Harbhajan Singh, who went through the exercise during Indias opening match, versus Holland in Paarl. We were under the impression that two players will be tested after every game. However, as it turns out, that wont be the case  no names were drawn either before the Australia match (Centurion) or Wednesdays game in Harare, one of the sources pointed out. Obviously, the impression created (by the ICC) that there will be dope tests on two players from each XII  to be determined by lots before the match  isnt quite right. As another source put it: Essentially, its random testing. He added: That the Indians havent been intimated anything (the tests on Srinath and Harbhajan were last Wednesday) indicates all is clear. In any case, both got the green signal in tests conducted at the BCCIs behest. Its not clear whether the ICC is obliged to revert to the team management in case the results dont show any abnormality. A non-issue Clive Lloyd, Match Referee during the India-Zimbabwe game, feels too much has been made out of the oversized bats. Speaking exclusively at the Harare Airport Thursday morning, he said: My pre-match inspection wasnt precedent-creating... Moreover, bats belonging to both teams didnt meet the specifications and, so, a bit of shaving was done. Thats all. Lloyd added: In fact, till now, I dont even know who those bats belonged to... Match Referees have, in the past, done random checking and will continue to do so. Its no big deal as the bottomline is I was satisfied before the game got underway. Nothing to do with any controversy, but Lloyd himself started the trend of using heavy bats.  Copyright

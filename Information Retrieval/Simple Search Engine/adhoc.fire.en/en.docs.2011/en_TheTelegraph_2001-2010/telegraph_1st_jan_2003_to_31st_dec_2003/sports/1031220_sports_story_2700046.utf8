The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India made to toil on Day I
 - Love, openers make merry as Australia A declare at 311 for five Hobart: The touring Indians had an indifferent start to their three-day match against Australia A, who dominated the opening day at the picturesque Bellerive Oval here on Friday. The hosts won the toss and piled up a score of 311 for five before declaring their innings and gave an early jolt to the Indians by removing opener Sadagopan Ramesh in the remaining 13 overs. India finished the day at 37 for one with Akash Chopra and Deep Dasgupta at the crease on 12 and 18, respectively. Ramesh (4) was dismissed when he took his eyes off a lifting delivery from Matt Nicholson and lobbed it in the gully region where Damien Wright took a neat catch. Speedster Shaun Tait, whose pace has been in the news in recent days, bowled a couple of overs but the pitch did not seem an ally to his kind of methods. Earlier, Sourav Ganguly lost the toss and the home team was given a good start by openers Michael Hussey (67) and Chris Rogers (70). The duo put on 119 runs for the first wicket. Then Martin Love, the Test hopeful further staked his claims with a strokeful 94 which caught the attention of a smattering of spectators on a cold damp day here. Love was neat in his footwork and did a bit of damage to left-arm spinner Murali Kartiks figures with some lusty hitting, including a lofted straight drive which cleared the ground. Kartik was introduced into attack only in the 40th over. Australia A were given a great start by Hussey and Rogers who went to lunch at 114 for no loss. Roger received a reprieve on 50 when he drove at a widish half volley from captain Sourav Ganguly and the catch was floored by Ramesh at gully. India finally broke through at the total on 119 when Rogers fell to a catch behind the stumps off Souravs bowling for 70, having batted for 127 minutes and faced 94 deliveries, hitting 10 fours. Ashish Nehra was used only for 10 overs by Sourav. He captured two wickets  Hussey, essaying a pull and offering a catch to Sourav at mid-on and then off the last ball before tea, Brad Hodge was cleaned up for one. Hussey batted for 225 minutes for his 67 runs, hitting six fours and a six from 158 deliveries. Hodge, who had made a stunning 264 against the Indians for Victoria at the MCG in the opening match of the tour, lasted for 15 minutes and faced 15 balls as he could not come up with the slow nature of the pitch. Despite the overhead cloud cover, the strip in the middle did not offer much pace or bounce to the bowlers and the visitors mostly toiled in unhelpful conditions. Nehra was the pick of the Indian bowlers with two for 33 from 10 overs. Irfan Pathan was hit around for a few runs and Lakshmipathy Balaji appeared a bowler whose confidence is at a low ebb. Not only did he concede 84 runs in his 18 overs, he overstepped the bowling crease nine times. The Indian seamers did no good to their sides cause by bowling as many as 17 no balls and three wides. Besides Balajis nine no balls, Sourav bowled seven. Pathan, who went for 77 runs in his 22 overs, was responsible for all the wides. After Rameshs departure in the third over with the Indian score reading five, Chopra and Dasgupta displayed some patience in negotiating the opposition pacers. Chopras unbeaten 12 came in almost one hour and 35 balls while Dasgupta took 34 balls for his unfinished knock. Rahul Dravid, who scored a career-best 233 and 72 not out to play a stellar role in Indias historic Test win in Adelaide, VVS Laxman, Anil Kumble, Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan were rested for the match. Rogers said after the first days play: Actually, he was the pick of the bowlers early on. Conditions suited him and he got more movement than other new ball bowlers. He nipped the ball around both ways. We were conscious of watching him and in the end he got us, said Rogers. Rogers praised the other bowlers too, saying they all bowled in good areas. They swung it well, the pitch was a little bit slow at times. That might not have helped them but they got the ball in good areas. Love praised left-arm spinner Murali Kartik and said he showed good control. Kartik was good. His control is good but it wasnt an ideal wicket for him, especially on the first day, Love said. Love added his side would look to force the issue against the Indians over the next two days. We are keen to force the issue. Thats why the declaration came late in the day. Im disappointed for not getting the hundred but then we were pushing for runs at that point. Still the shot wasnt good and I paid the consequence.  (PTI)  Copyright

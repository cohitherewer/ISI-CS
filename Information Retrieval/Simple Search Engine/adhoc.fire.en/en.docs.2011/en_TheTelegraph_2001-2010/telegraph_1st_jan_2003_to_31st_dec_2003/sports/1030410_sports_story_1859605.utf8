The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA hungry for success
 Shaun Pollock (right) and Makhaya Ntini after their arrival in Dhaka Wednesday Dhaka: South Africa are eager to make amends for their failure at the World Cup at home and are looking to the triangular series in Bangladesh to show their worth, new captain Graeme Smith said on Wednesday. The guys are hungry for success and are looking forward to showing their guts and potential... They were criticised badly at home after they had failed in the last World Cup, Smith told reporters at Dhaka Airport after his arrival with a 13-member squad. South Africa will play their first match on April 13 against India, who face Bangladesh in the tournaments opening game on Friday. The Indians, too, arrived later in the day. The 22-year-old left-handed batsman replaced Shaun Pollock after the Cup debacle. Its a great opportunity for us to start here in Dhaka, Smith said. Smith does not believe that the presence of Pollock in the team will be a problem. Shaun and I get along very well. I have no problems with him at all. In fact, he thinks that I am the best guy to lead the side. So honestly I dont think handling him will be a problem, he said. Describing the Indians as the in-form team in the meet, Smith said his new look team was capable of giving the World Cup finalists a run for their money. The key is to adapt to the hot and humid conditions here. The faster we make the change, the better for us. THE SQUAD Graeme Smith (captain), Paul Adams, Mark Boucher, Allan Dawson, Boeta Dippenaar, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Neil McKenzie, Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Rudolph, Charl Willoughby.

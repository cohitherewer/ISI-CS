		 Sunday, May 18, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Madrid: World track and fields anti-doping chief determined in 1988 that drug samples provided by eight American athletes at the Olympic trials that year should not be treated as positives, according to IAAF records. Arne Ljungqvist, head of the sports anti-doping commission, found that the US Olympic committee had wrongly announced that eight athletes had been found positive, according to minutes of the IAAF council meeting in Seoul, on September 18-19, 1988.				 																																	The document supports the International Association of Athletic Federations statement last month that the USOC was right in clearing Carl Lewis and other athletes of doping violations. According to documents released to media outlets by Dr Wade Exum, the USOCs former director for drug control, US athletes tested positive for drugs more than 100 times from 1988-2000. Only a handful were barred from competing; 19 went on to win medals.				 																																	Hamburg: Boris Becker hopes that Pete Sampras decision to miss this years French Open and Wimbledon championships does not mark the end of his illustrious career. You have to respect his decision. But I sincerely hope we see him one more time at the US Open. I dont know if this is it, I hope not, the six-time Grand Slam winner said at the Masters Series event in Hamburg on Friday. I havent spoken to him so I dont know whats on his mind. Its probably the most difficult decision of his life.				 																																	Sampras has not played a match since winning his 14th career Grand Slam by beating Andre Agassi at the 2002 US Open but Becker, who lost to Sampras in the 1995 Wimbledon final, believes it will be hard for him to walk away. It took me a while to call it quits and I think anybody who has won a Grand Slam or two, in his case 14, its something we have been doing all our lives so we dont have the game plan for what is going to happen after. You need time to finally make up your mind, he said.				 																																	Milan: Italians may be revelling in their whitewash of this seasons Champions League, but next season they could face a blackout of European soccer on their TV screens. Uefa, European soccers governing body, says talks over broadcasting rights in Italy for the continents premier club competition are deadlocked after broadcasters Mediaset and Sky Italia offered to pay only 50 million Euros, half of what they stumped up for the previous rights deal.				 																																	The Champions League final will be an all-Italian affair with Juventus facing AC Milan in Manchester on May 28. 				 																																	Athens: Fraud inspectors confiscated 13,500 T-shirts and other counterfeit Olympic clothing following a raid in Central Athens, 2004 organisers said Saturday. The clothes, packed in 110 boxes, were seized on Wednesday. 				 																																	The articles bore the 2004 olive wreath logo and images of Olympic mascots Athena and Phevos, modelled on ancient Greek dolls. Several officials from the raided clothing company were charged with fraud, organisers said. 				 																																	Mexico City: Mexico will check the naturalisation papers of 23 foreign-born soccer players after media reports alleged that a Brazilian had forged his papers. Local media reported on Friday that Brazilian Joao Batista, who plays for Colibries, had used a false naturalisation letter to obtain a Mexican passport in December.  Birmingham: Steve Bruce has agreed to  stay on as manager of Birmingham City for another five years  after keeping the club in the Premier League this season.  The former Manchester United captain took over at Birmingham  in December 2001 and led the side back into the top flight  for the first time in 16 years after winning last years  playoff final.

 New Zealand brush Bangladesh aside

(AFP) Kimberley: New Zealand crushed Bangladesh by seven wickets with 16 overs to spare in World Cup Group B on Wednesday to remain firmly in contention for the Super Sixes. Opening batsman Craig McMillan top-scored with 75 to help the New Zealanders race to their target after Bangladesh made 198 for seven, easily their best total of the tournament but never enough to threaten. McMillan smashed two sixes and nine fours from 83 balls before Scott Styris (37 not out) and Chris Cairns (33 not out) rapidly finished the job and improved New Zealands net run-rate, a factor that could decide who makes the next stage. Playing their first match in 10 days after boycotting their game against Kenya, the Black Caps showed signs of rustiness in the field as they allowed the Bangladeshis to bat through their full 50 overs for the first time in the tournament. Teenager Mohammad Ashraful scored his first half-century in one-day Internationals after Cairns dropped him on 24, and tailender Mohammad Rafique finished unbeaten on 41 after a late flurry. Ashraful, who became the youngest player in history to score a Test century on debut when he made 114 against Sri Lanka aged 17 years 63 days, finally transferred his Test form to the one-day arena with a stylish 56 off 82 balls. He hooked fast bowler Shane Bond for six and struck six fours, including a square cut off Cairns to reach his fifty, helping his side pass their previous high score for the tournament of 124. Bangladesh, who have not won a one-day International in almost four years, looked to be heading towards another paltry total when they slumped to 128 for seven before Rafique and captain Khaled Mashud chipped in with an adventurous eighth-wicket partnership of 70. While their bowlers struggled at times, New Zealands batsmen had no real problems against a pedestrian Bangladesh attack, although right-arm seamer Khaled Mahmud did claim three wickets. New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming hit a quickfire 32, including 19 off Tapash Baishyas fourth over, before he was controversially given out caught and bowled after the ball appeared to strike his pad. Andre Adams added 18 at almost a run a ball before he chanced his arm once too often and gave a simple catch to Ashraful at mid-on, and McMillan threw his wicket away when he was bowled attempting a bizarre reverse sweep. There were no more hiccups for the New Zealanders as Styris and Cairns scored briskly in an unbroken stand of 61. Styris 37 came off 36 balls while Cairns needed just 21 deliveries for his 33, which included a straight-driven six off Alok Kapali that cleared the stands and had to be retrieved from a parking lot. New Zealands final pool game is against Canada while Bangladesh take on Kenya in their last match.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

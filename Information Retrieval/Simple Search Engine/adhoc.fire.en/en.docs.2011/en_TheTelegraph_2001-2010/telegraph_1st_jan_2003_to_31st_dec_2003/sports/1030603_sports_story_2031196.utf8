 SC refuses to stay order
New Delhi: Ajay Jadejas cricketing career received a boost Monday with the Supreme Court refusing to stay a Delhi high court interim order allowing him to play in domestic cricket, notwithstanding objections of the BCCI, says PTI. Directing BCCI to approach the high court division bench to seek modification or changes in its May 28 order, the apex court disposed of the boards petition, saying he has been allowed to play only domestic cricket. A vacation bench comprising Justice N. Santosh Hegde and Justice Shivaraj Patil said though the high court had fixed the next hearing in the matter for July 21, it would not preclude the board from approaching the high court before that to make appropriate submissions. Appearing for the BCCI, senior counsel Gopal Subramaniam assailed the May 28 ex-parte order of the high court saying it amounted to ordering implementation of the arbitration award, giving a clean chit to Jadeja in the match-fixing scandal. The bench said it was only an interim order and the board, if it had reservations, should approach the division bench to seek appropriate modification. Legal opinion A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds : BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said the Board will be seeking legal opinion on the Jadeja issue. Well seek legal opinion... Whatever administrative action we take will be guided by legal advice, Dalmiya said. Since the matter is in CBIs hands, it has to be fought and argued by them. Dalmiya added if the Board is advised by its legal cell to go ahead with the (Jadeja) issue, it will take up necessary action. If, on the contrary, we are advised not to go ahead (with the issue), well intimate ICC (about this), he pointed out. (PTI)  Copyright

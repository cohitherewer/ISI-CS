The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chennai HC vacates stay 
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, Sept. 6: Unless an appeal is made, the path has been cleared for direct affiliation of new states like Jharkhand and readmission of old ones like UP into the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). According to The Telegraphs sources, this can quickly come about now as the Chennai High Court has vacated its stay on the BCCIs special general meeting which was to have been held on September 8 last year. That session was to have deliberated on amending the constitution. Intriguingly, the petition (asking for that stay) was filed by a fifth division club in Chennai. Obviously, it was influenced by the BCCIs politics.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Greene calls for maximum penalty 
 Greene thinks doping is badly hurting sport Walnut (California): Reigning Olympic 100m champion Maurice Greene called for an investigation into allegations that prominent US Olympians, like Carl Lewis, failed drug tests in the build-up to the 1988 Seoul Games. Everybody who tested positive should get busted. There shouldnt be any cover-ups, said Greene at the Mount San Antonio College relays on Saturday where he won the 200m. The charges, reported this week in Sports Illustrated, The Daily Telegraph in London and The Orange County Register, came in documents released by former US Olympic committee anti-doping official Dr Wade Exum. Exums papers indicated Lewis was one of 19 prominent American athletes who tested positive but were still allowed to compete in South Korea. Lewis was awarded the gold medal in Seoul in the 100m after Canadian Ben Johnson was stripped of his for failing a dope test after the race. Johnson tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. It is terrible, Greene said. It is hurting our sport in general ...Not just in the United States but in general. It is a bad thing. According to Exums documents, Lewis was one of three eventual gold medallists who tested positive for banned stimulants at the 1988 Olympic trials in Indianapolis. It was claimed Lewis gave three urine samples containing pseudoephedrine, ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. American runner Terry Evens said that he was stunned by the claims against Lewis, who won nine Olympic gold medals in a glittering career. I heard about it last night when a couple of guys were sitting around talking, said Evens, who competed in a relay at Mt SAC. I was shocked. It left me speechless. I still look up to Carl. Joe Deloach, who won the 200m, and Andre Phillips, who won the 400m hurdles, also tested positive for a banned stimulant in 1988. None was prevented from competing after the US Olympic Committee determined they had ingested the substances inadvertently. (AFP)  Copyright

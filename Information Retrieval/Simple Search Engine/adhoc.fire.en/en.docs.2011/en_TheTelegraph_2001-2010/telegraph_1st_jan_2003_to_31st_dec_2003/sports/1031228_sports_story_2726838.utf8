The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Oram knock gives NZ the edge
Wellington, Dec. 27 (Reuters): New Zealand gained control of the second Test against Pakistan on Saturday after the tourists lost two quick wickets before ending the day on 52 for two in reply to a competitive total of 366. The two men out were opener Imran Farhat and Yasir Hameed, with Jacob Oram and Ian Butler claiming a wicket apiece in the space of seven balls to leave Pakistan struggling on 30 for two. Taufeeq Umar (13) and Yousuf Youhana (11) put on 22 without any further damage. New Zealand, resuming on 151 for five, wrested the initiative thanks to a battling 82 from opener Mark Richardson and an attacking 97 by Jacob Oram. After dominating the opening day, it was left to paceman Shoaib Akhtar to mop up New Zealands tail as the home side was dismissed shortly after tea. Before tea, Oram had helped New Zealand take advantage of a tiring Pakistan attack and was unlucky to miss out on a century when he edged a Shabbir delivery to the wicketkeeper for his highest Test score.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Srinath should clear air next week
 - One-to-one with Brijesh Patel before  leaving for Durham BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI SRINATH: Doesnt  seem keen on continuing  PATEL: Unlikely to  make another request Calcutta: Just where Jawagal  Srinath stands, in relation to Team India, should be clear  early next week when the veteran speedster has a one-to-one  with chief selector Brijesh Patel. Indications are that Srinath,  who took back his Test-retirement seven months ago, will  quit both forms of international cricket. Srinath and I will be having  a chat in the next few days, in Bangalore, before he leaves  for Durham Lets see what Srinath says, but he has indicated  he doesnt wish to continue, Patel told The Telegraph  Thursday evening. In the city for a National Cricket  Academy meeting, Patel hinted he wont do a repeat of last  September  requesting Srinath to make himself available  for both forms. [It was at Patel and captain Sourav  Gangulys behest that Srinath played in the Test series  (at home) against the West Indies, after initially having  made himself unavailable for Test cricket anywhere.] Look, fast bowling takes a lot  out of the cricketer in question Its so very demanding  and Patel didnt say anything more, perhaps because he  has prepared himself for the end of the Srinath era. Sourav, by the way, has already  announced he wont be making another request. Srinath, for his part, has been  maintaining he needs more time to actually decide on his  future. Its not insignificant that he made himself unavailable  for the tri-series in Dhaka, beginning Friday. Yet, the next few months will  see Srinath based in Chester-le-Street (Durhams HQ) as  one of the overseas pros  the other being South African  Dewald Pretorious. Besides sharing the new ball, he will  be the youngest Countys bowling coach. Srinaths contract, of course,  is till Australian Martin Love (currently in the West Indies)  becomes available. Its possible, though, that the bowling  coach bit in his contract will be extended. Incidentally, over 11 years of  big-time cricket has seen Srinath collect 236 wickets in  (67) Tests and 315 wickets in (229) ODIs. He turns 34 in  August. Copyright

 Wright: A quiet confidence in squad
 Durban: The Indian team is going about the task of capturing World Cup glory with quiet determination, coach John Wright said on Friday, even as he put to rest all speculation about Sachin Tendulkars injury worries. Theres a bit of quiet determination in the squad, even the new players are talking of being successful, which is a very good sign, he said here. Admitting that Tendulkars ankle injury in New Zealand was a nasty blow for the team, Wright said the master batsman was now fully fit and raring to go. It was a nasty blow for us, but weve had to manage Sachin during the time of his injury and he has fully recovered to make his place in the team, he said. Its exciting times and weve been working towards this tournament for over a year and things seem to be coming together. We are in a difficult group, and if we come through that, then we could be a dangerous proposition. Nostalgic trip Meanwhile, World Cup organisers have arranged for the Gandhi Memorial train to take the Indians to Pietermaritzburg for their warm-up matches. India play a warm-up match against Kwa-Zulu Natal on February 4 and a league tie versus Namibia on February 23 in Pietermaritzburg  where Gandhi was thrown off a train in June 1893. The Indians will travel along the route taken by Gandhi and disembark at the historic station. (PTI)  Copyright

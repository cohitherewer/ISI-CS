The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dutta under cardiac scan
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Amal Dutta was transferred to the Apollo Hospital at Salt Lake from Daffodil Nursing Home late Friday evening with cardiac complications. Looking after him are two consultant cardiologists of the hospital, Dr Subham Roy and Dr Aftab Khan. A hospital doctor said Dutta is suffering from unstable angina. His condition at this point is stable but needs a diagnostic process called coronary angiogram to see where the blockages are in the blood vessels, the doctor added.  Copyright

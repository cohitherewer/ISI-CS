The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Delhi HC directive on Ajay Jadeja
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court Thursday directed the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to consider Ajay Jadeja for selection in Ranji Trophy matches if found eligible in view of the arbitrators award in his favour. A bench comprising Justice D. Bhandari and Justice R.S. Sodhi issued the order on a petition moved by the cricketer seeking direction to the BCCI following the arbitrators award given three months ago. Arbitrator Justice (Retd.) J. K. Mehra, who was appointed by the High Court, had given a ruling in Jadejas favour on the five-year ban imposed on him by the BCCI in the wake of the match-fixing controversy. The award is to become final and binding on April 27. [Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta adds: As was reported by The Telegraph a few days ago, there are indications that the BCCI will be challenging Justice Mehras award. Cricket circles, of course, are amazed that the Delhi High Court seems to have been moved simultaneously with the arbitration process.] The court sought reply from the BCCI within two weeks on Jadejas petition and the matter will come up for hearing on May 19. The courts direction came after BCCIs counsel Kapil Sibals submission that Jadeja may be considered for selection if found eligible. (PTI)  Copyright

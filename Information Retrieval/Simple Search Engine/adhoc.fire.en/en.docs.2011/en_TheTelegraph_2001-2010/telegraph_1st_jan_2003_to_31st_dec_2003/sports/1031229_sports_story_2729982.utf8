The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Afridi takes it upon himself
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dinesh Mongia en route to his 48 at the Eden on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Maine sabse ganda khela,  thats how a dejected Shahid Afridi summed up his emotions following his teams exit from the Asian A championship at the Eden Gardens on Sunday. The Pakistan A skipper felt he badly let his team down in the tournament, though his teammates did not do a good job either. There are some experienced boys in the team, but then you cant fight if they all fail to deliver at the same time, Afridi said. He felt Pakistan A failed in all departments of the game, and these players have to improve drastically if they want to entertain any hopes of making the senior team. Afridi however, defended his decision to bat first on a wicket that was doing so much for the bowlers. It was a positive decision, we wanted to have the runs on the board in a pressure match like this. But then all credit to India for the way they played His Indian counterpart Hemang Badani, however, felt he would have fielded if he won the toss. Afridi felt the matches apart, it was a great experience touring India. The hospitality was so good and the people were extremely friendly. We really enjoyed the trip. On the other hand, Man of the Match Dinesh Mongia looked a disappointed man after failing to make the India squad for the tri-series in Australia. I came here with a few big scores in the Ranji Trophy. Todays performance was also satisfying. I think I had done my job Mongia quipped.  Copyright

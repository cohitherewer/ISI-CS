The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tapashi, Archana set meet records 
 - STATE ATHLETICS l Senior pole vault reduced to one-horse race  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tapashi Nandy bettered her own pole vault mark Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Tapashi Nandy of City AC and Archana Mondal of North 24 Parganas created meet records in the senior section on the opening day of the 53rd state athletic championship at Salt Lake Stadium and SAI Eastern Centre Thursday. Babli Mitra also set a new record  in pole vault  in the girls under-20 category. She cleared 2.55 metres to better Tapashis old mark of 2.35. Tapashis 2.35, in fact, was also the existing record in the womens section. She bettered it with an effort of 2.75. Archana also erased her own record in womens discus throw, clearing 40.40m to obliterate her earlier best of 39.52. The pole vault events were not well contested. There was just one athlete competing against Tapashi in the womens section, and she too was disqualified. Babli had two competitors, both of whom were also disqualified. No dope test The state meet has to do without dope tests, even after the National Games fracas. We just dont have the infrastructure. Neither do we have the resources to set them up for a meet of this stature, said B.N. Lahiri, president of the state athletics association, who is also the treasurer of the national federation. Its not mandatory to conduct dope tests for such meets. We dont have photo finish facilities for the same reason, he said. Association stipends The state body has listed seven promising athletes who need financial help and is giving them a monthly stipend of Rs 250 each. The third instalment in this scheme will be handed over to the athletes Sunday. The recipients are: Hari Shankar Roy, Birangana Thakur, Mallika Mondal, Sabina Khatun, Safina Khatun, Ranjita Roy, Dipankar Roy.

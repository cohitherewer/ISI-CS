				 																																	Johannesburg: South Africa skipper Shaun Pollock skipped the inquest into his teams dismal World Cup performance. He is, instead, away on holiday with his wife. Pollock was widely criticised after the Proteas failed to get beyond the first round and he was expected to attend a meeting of the national selection committee on Wednesday.				 																																	Committee convenor Omar Henry, however, refused to pile more onto the shoulders of Pollock. With all the emotion of the World Cup, the fact that his wife is pregnant, he felt he would rather just stay on holiday with her, he said. He gave all his instructions to coach Eric Simons to pass on to us.				 																																	Mumbai: Complimenting the Indian team on its performance, former selection committee chairman Chandu Borde said on Thursday if the Indians keep up the tempo, they will definitely win the Cup. There is no doubt about the talent of the team and I am happy that we persisted with it, Borde said.				 																																	I had full faith in Souravs ability as a leader. I am very proud of the way Sourav has handled the team.

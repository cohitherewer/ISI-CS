The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Surya first, Sandipan second
 Surya 2nd from Bengal to win the title Kozhikode, Dec. 20 (PTI): GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly won the 41st National A chess championship with a win over Suvrajit Saha in the 23rd and final round on Saturday. Surya became the second player from Bengal after GM Dibyendu Barua to win Indias biggest title. GM Sandipan Chanda, who beat Sriram Jha, completed a Bengal 1-2, coming second on tie-break score despite finishing alongside Surya on 17.5 points. Top seed GM P. Harikrishna of Andhra, tied with Surya and Sandipan till the 22nd round, finished third with 17 points after being held by S. Satyapragyan. In a three-way tie for the fourth spot, GM Abhijit Kunte finished fourth, thanks to a better tie-break score than Barua and Koneru Humpy, who finished fifth and sixth, respectively, with 15 points. The top six from the National A meet usually constitutes the Indian team for the Chess Olympiad. But this year, only the top four may be picked, since Viswanathan Anand and K. Sasikiran are likely to join the team. It was a hugely satisfying performance for Surya  the former national under-10 and under-12 champion. He had also won the bronze medal in the world junior meet in Goa last year.  Copyright

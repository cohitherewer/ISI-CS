The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England on the backfoot
 - Murali accuses Hussain of calling him a cheat and chucker  Michael Vaughan en route to 52 in Kandy on Thursday. (Reuters) Kandy: Englands top-order collapsed during a controversial and ill-tempered second day to the second Test on Thursday, with the mercurial Muttiah Muralidharan yet again at the centre of the action. England, replying to Sri Lankas 382 after five wickets from Ashely Giles, lost four wickets for 30 runs either side of tea to close on 163 for four, still 219 adrift. Graham Thorpe (20 not out) and Paul Collingwood (19 not out) halted Englands slide, scratching out an unbroken stand of 44 in just under one-and-a-half hours on Thursday. Muralidharan, who earlier accused Nasser Hussain of verbal abuse and who also got involved in a bizarre incident at the end of the Sri Lankan innings, took two for 28 from 16 overs. The complaint against Hussain  Sri Lankan team sources said Muralidharan had complained of being called a cheat and a chucker while batting  was later dismissed by Match Referee Clive Lloyd, who said the allegations could not be proved although it was obvious that something had been said. He also warned both teams over their future conduct. Muralidharan put the brakes on the English reply after a thundering start by Marcus Trescothick (36) and Michael Vaughan (52) as 89 runs came off the opening 18 overs. Sri Lanka, resuming on 277 for seven, had lost Tillekeratne with only one run added before the last two wickets added 104. Their innings ended in confusion as Muralidharan was bowled by Giles. Umpires Aleem Dar and Darryl Harper, however, failed to see the ball clip the top of the off stump and initially ruled the batsman not out, a decision that prompted heckling from English supporters. After a short conference, with Vaughan joining in, the umpires signalled for television assistance. Clive Lloyd argued that they knew something was wrong and sensibly used common sense. He denied suggestions that Vaughan had pressured the umpires into taking action.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

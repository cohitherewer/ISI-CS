Both goals in Tuesdays game came in the first half, with Chinese Taipei scoring first on 16 minutes through midfielder Cheng Yu-hsing. Myanmar were reduced to 10 players three minutes later when Moe Moe War was sent off for a strong tackle on Tseng Shu-o. The Myanmarese equalised on 31 minutes when a cross from Thet Thet Win found Nhin Si Myint on the edge of the area.

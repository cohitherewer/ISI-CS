 Joshna beats Vaidehi to gold
 Chennai: Indias Joshna Chinappa and Vaidehi Reddy bagged the gold and silver medals, respectively, in the girls singles of the 11th Asian squash junior championship in Islamabad on Wednesday. Joshna defeated Vaidehi 5-9, 9-7, 9-4, 9-6. This is the first time that two Indian players have figured in the title clash in this event. Joshna, the reigning under-17 British Junior Open champion, had defeated Hong Kongs Chan Ho-ling in the semi-final. The second semi-final between Vaidehi and Chiu Ka-kei of Hong Kong also went to four games. Reddy claimed the first two games 9-4, 9-4 but committed a lot of unforced errors in the third to lose it 9-10. In fact, Reddy served twice for the match at 9-8 and 9-9. In the fourth, she made amends for her mistakes and secured it at 9-3.  (PTI)  Copyright

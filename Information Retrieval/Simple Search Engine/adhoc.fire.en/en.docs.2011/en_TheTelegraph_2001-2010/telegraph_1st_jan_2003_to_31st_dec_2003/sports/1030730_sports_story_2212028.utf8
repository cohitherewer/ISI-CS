 Agassi, a tough act to follow
Washington: Andre Agassi set a lofty standard for the next wave of US tennis stars, saying hes part of a tough generation to follow. The up-and-comers include Andy Roddick and James Blake, the last two champions of the Legg Mason Classic, which began on Monday. Agassi has won the tournament five times. Whats Andy Roddick, five in the world? Agassi said. Thats No. 5 on the planet; thats a pretty good effort. But if youre used to No. 1, its going to have to be more. Agassi, 33, is the only active member of a talented group of Grand Slam winners who dominated the 1990s. Its a tough generation to follow  myself, Pete, Chang, Courier.

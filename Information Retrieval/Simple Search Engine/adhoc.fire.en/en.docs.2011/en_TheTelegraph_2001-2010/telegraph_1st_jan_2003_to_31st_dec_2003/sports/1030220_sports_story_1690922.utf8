The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka whip Canada, in a 23.4-over match 
Vaas, Nissanka share seven wickets as minnows crash to lowest-ever ODI total Sri Lankas Prabath Nissanka celebrates the wicket of Canadas John Davison for a duck during their World Cup match in Paarl Wednesday. Canada were all out for a record low score of 36. Paarl: Sri Lanka coasted to a comprehensive nine-wicket victory over Canada in their World Cup group B match on Wednesday, after dismissing their opponents for the lowest total in one-day International history.Canada crashed to 36 all out and Sri Lanka eased home in only 4.4 overs to complete the second fastest run-chase in one-dayers. The match lasted a total of 23.4 overs.Opener Marvan Atapattu remained unbeaten on 24.Left-arm seamer Chaminda Vaas, with three for 15, and new-ball partner Prabath Nissanka, with four for 12, made the most of swinging conditions and some poor batting technique as Canada were bowled out in 18.4 overs.

Namibia 84 vs Pakistan, Kimberley 2003. The North Americans were dismissed for a lower total than the previous mark, Zimbabwes 38 against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2001.Canada had also held the previous record low for the World Cup, having been bowled out for 45 by England at Manchester in 1979.We had hoped to put up a better fight, although we appreciate that Sri Lanka are one of the best one-day sides in the world, said Canada captain Harris. It was a pretty good wicket out there and I think the pressure just got the better of us.Sri Lanka captain Sanath Jayasuriya was delighted that his side achieved their third successive win of the tournament in such clinical fashion.Vaas and Nissanka bowled really well and we wanted to bat as quickly as possible, he said. I think the wicket was good but, in the first few overs, we bowled really well.Although Canada produced the first major upset of the tournament with a 60-run victory over Bangladesh in their opening game, not one of their batsman reached double figures against Sri Lanka.Their top scorers were opener Desmond Chumney and captain Harris, who both made nine.Nissanka made the initial breakthrough in the second over when John Davison edged a superb leg-cutter behind to depart for no score.Vaas, who claimed six for 25 in Sri Lankas 10-wicket demolition of Bangladesh last week, trapped Fazil Samad leg-before for naught with an inswinger as the batsmen pushed half forward in the fifth over.The left-arm seamer then removed Chumney, for nine, with a lifting delivery that was edged behind before Ian Billcliff, Canadas best batsman in the tournament, was leg-before for one playing back to a ball which kept a little low.Canada plunged into deeper trouble at 12 for six in the 11th over when Nissanka claimed two wickets in successive deliveries, Nicholas De Groot leg-before for no score and Ishwar Maraj trapped in front for a golden duck.Captain Harris was the next to go, but in rather unfortunate fashion, hitting his wicket with his bat as he tried to avoid a Nisanka bouncer.Seam bowler Dilhara Fernando, with two for four, and off spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, with one for three, mopped up the tail as Canadas innings disentegrated..When we came here for this tournament, we knew that the test nations would be a tough ask but we didnt expect to fold up like this. We are extremely disappointed, Harris added. (REUTERS)  Copyright

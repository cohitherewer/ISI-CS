				 	 DONALD																								Cape Town: South Africa coach Eric Simons and team physiotherapist Shane Jabbar have played down an injury scare involving Allan Donald after the paceman pulled up in training on Monday.																								Speaking in Tuesdays edition of the Cape Times newspaper, Simons described the incident as a very minor scare.																								The medical team have assured me he will be right for the World Cup as well as all our warm-up matches. Hes just a little bit stiff from our activities at last weeks training camp, Simons said.																								The assessment was confirmed by Jabbar. Hes a little bit tight in some of the muscle groups he hasnt used before, Jabbar told the newspaper.																								The activities (in the training camp) ranged from running downhill to sitting on a bicycle saddle for three hours. All that was quite taxing for a fast bowlers body.																								At practice one of the muscles deep in his backside developed a trigger point, an area of muscular spasm that just didnt want to let go. 																								Every time he was running in, pulling his weight through, it was just clenching up. It was so tight that it caused him discomfort, said Jabbar.																								There is no need to risk him this early by bowling when he is obviously in discomfort. There is nothing serious that is going to prevent him from playing at all. He will be ready for Saturdays warm-up match (against provincial side Western Province) for instance. (REUTERS)

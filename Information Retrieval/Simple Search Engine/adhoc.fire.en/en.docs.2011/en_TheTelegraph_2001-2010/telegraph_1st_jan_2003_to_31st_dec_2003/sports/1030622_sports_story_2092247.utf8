The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indias isolation on Terms persists
- Dalmiya closes Denness issue on humanitarian grounds  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Mike Denness Jagmohan Dalmiya Calcutta, June 21: Indias isolation on the Player Terms issue, within the International Cricket Council (ICC), persists.Indeed, if some (rather optimistically) expected a dramatic change with Pakistans Ehsan Mani taking over the presidency, yesterdays developments in Monte Carlo will come as a disappointment.Specifically, the ICCs business arm  Monaco-registered IDI Ltd  decided to continue withholding Indias full guarantee money related to World Cup 2003, amounting to around $ 9 million.With breaks, the board meeting lasted almost nine hours.[The IDI Ltd is registered in Monaco for tax benefits and its board is constituted in exactly the same way as the ICCs Executive Board.] The only concession, if one could call it so, is that the IDI Ltd (with Mani in the chair) agreed on preparing its response to claims from the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC) as soon as practicable.Indias money has been held back on account of the GCCs overall claim, which is in the region of $ 50 million. The GCC, its to be noted, has marketing rights for all ICC events till the 2007 World Cup.Significantly, while the IDI Ltd refused to heed pleas from India, it decided on releasing part of the guarantee money withheld from England and New Zealand. Sri Lanka, of course, had much to smile: The entire $ 0.5 million, held back for not meeting the December 31 (2002) cut-off on naming the World Cup squad, has been released.Instalment No.1 for all three countries, by the way, was released immediately after the World Cup. In Monte Carlo, England emerged the bigger beneficiary, getting back $ 1.5 million of the $ 3.5 million. New Zealand, on the other hand, got $ 0.5 million of the $ 2.5 million withheld. England stand to be penalised for not playing in Harare; New Zealand for skipping Nairobi.Given that both England and New Zealand have an identical $ 2 million still held back, that probably will be the eventual penalty for not turning up in Harare/Nairobi.Those claims can be quantified Yet, how is the one against India going to be done? In any case, I made two points: That our money cant be withheld indefinitely and, secondly, we reserve the right to file a counter claim that the GCCs marketing wasnt proper, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya told The Telegraph.Speaking from the Le Meredian Beach Plaza (in Monte Carlo), early this morning, Dalmiya added: The World Cup finished three months ago but, till now, a specific claim hasnt been lodged. We will have a response once thats done and, as Ive said, we reserve the right to challenge the GCCs marketing strategyMeanwhile, at the same meeting, India agreed to treat the Mike Denness (Match Referee) affair as closed.According to Dalmiya, Mani made a request, on humanitarian grounds, and he had to oblige.Denness is keeping very poor health after last years heart surgery and everyone felt he may not survive regular appearances before a four-member Commission (constituted 15 months ago). So, when that request was made, I couldnt disregard it, Dalmiya explained.Twenty months ago, however, Denness (a former England captain) almost split the world of cricket when he banned Virender Sehwag for one Test and fined five others  including captain Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar  during the controversy-packed Port Elizabeth Test.Thereafter, the ICC had formed a three-member Commission (Majid Khan, Andrew Hilditch and Justice Albie Sachs) to look into a number of issues including Denness action.The composition of that Commission, though, was objected to by India and, in March 2002, it was reconstituted with Wesley Hall, Bob Merriman, Peter Chingoka and Lord Hugh Griffiths. Intriguingly, the Commission never met. Effectively, then, the Denness-business was already dead.Monte  Copyright

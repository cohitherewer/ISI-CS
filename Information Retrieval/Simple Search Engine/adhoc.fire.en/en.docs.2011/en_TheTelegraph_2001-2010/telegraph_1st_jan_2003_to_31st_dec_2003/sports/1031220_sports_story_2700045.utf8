The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Three-way lead with a round to go
 Surya Sekhar Kozhikode: GMs P. Harikrishna, Sandipan Chanda and Surya Sekhar Ganguly scored victories and continued to lead the table after the 22nd and penultimate round of the National A chess competition on Friday. They are on 16.5 points. Following the leaders is GM Abhijit Kunte on 14.5, while GMs Dibyendu Barua and Koneru Humpy are on joint fifth with 14 each. Tejas Bakre is sixth with 13.5  half-a-point ahead of Neelotpal Das. Sandipan faces the toughest final-round test, against IM Sriram Jha. Surya meets Suvrajit Saha of Bengal, while Harikrishna plays IM S. Satyaprgyan. The three leaders will all play with black pieces. Sandipan was the performer of the day as he defeated Humpy. In a bid to keep his maiden national title hopes alive, Sandipan was clinical in his approach and cashed in on minor positional errors by Humpy. Playing black, Humpy opted for the Petroff Defence and surprisingly opted for a passive variation that landed her in an inferior position. A timely queen exchange helped Sandipan exert pressure in the centre and Humpy lost a pawn without compensation. The game lasted 40 moves. Harikrishna posted his sixth successive victory, this time against Roktim Bandopadhyay of Bengal. His tie-break score is better than Sandipan and Surya though it may change after the final round. Roktim went down without a fight. Playing white, Harikrishna won a pawn in the middle-game and quickly exchanged the pieces to reach a winning position. Roktim resigned after 27 moves. Surya, who was sole leader for a major part of the tournament, accounted for Bengals Arghyadip Das who played black. It was a Sicilian Richter Rauzer where Surya showed great tactical wisdom and sacrificed a piece on the 22nd move. Arghyadip accepted defeat after five more moves. Barua fought back from a difficult position to beat Sriram Jha, while Neelotpal defeated M.R. Venkatesh.  (PTI)  Copyright

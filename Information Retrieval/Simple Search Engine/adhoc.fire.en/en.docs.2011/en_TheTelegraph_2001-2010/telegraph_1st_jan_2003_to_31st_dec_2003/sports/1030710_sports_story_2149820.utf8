The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Baileys coach for Tim and Marion
Raleigh: Triple Olympic champion Marion Jones and her partner, world 100m record-holder Tim Montgomery, named Dan Pfaff as their new coach Tuesday. Pfaff had coached Canadas Donovan Bailey to the 100m world record in 1996. We are extremely excited and looking forward to working with someone as experienced as Dan, the couple said in a statement. We feel that Dan will bring an element to our training that we have never experienced before, particularly his expertise as a technician in the sprints as well as the long jump. Pfaff had been tipped last month to be appointed after he spent time working with Montgomery at the US Nationals. The 49-year-old Pfaff is a specialist in both the sprints and field events, which would help Jones, who has said she would like to compete in both the long jump and sprints next year at the Athens Olympics. Jones has taken this year off after giving birth to her and Montgomerys son, also named Tim, who was born on June 28. She will begin working with Pfaff in September, when she is cleared to resume training, while Montgomery will begin working with him immediately, the statement said. Bailey set the then-world record of 9.84 seconds at the Atlanta Olympics. It has since been broken by American Maurice Greene and then Montgomery, who clocked 9.78 seconds last September in Paris. Jones and Montgomery had been without a coach since splitting from long-term mentor Trevor Graham last year. They worked with banned Canadian coach Charlie Francis but left him after an international uproar.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Warne not the only one: Steve
London: Australian Test captain Steve Waugh said tainted leg-spinner Shane Warne is not the only one in the Australian team to take non-prescribed drugs and that many of his teammates are guilty of doing the same. Waugh admitted he also took medicines without consulting his physician. I remember I had a severe migraine on a recent overseas trip while on the plane. To help alleviate the blinding headache, a fellow passenger said he had a tablet specifically for this ailment, Waugh said. I took it, only to start worrying about it later, so I consulted a doctor to check its contents. Thankfully, everything was legal but the thought of what the consequences might have been was terrifying, he wrote in his column for the Sunday Times. Waugh said he talked to his teammates, who said they too were guilty of taking medicines without knowing the contents. Since that controversy, I have spoken to quite a few players who have all indicated that at some stage or other, they have taken a cough mixture or headache tablet without checking the dangers, Waugh said. He also put to rest speculation regarding his recall as a possible replacement for Warne. They have to go for a spinner. Thats the way it is  it wont be approved by the technical committee otherwise, he said, adding: I dont bowl leg spin, so Ive no chance there.  (PTI)  Copyright

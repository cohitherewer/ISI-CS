 Charlesworth ready to coach India
Amstelveen, Aug. 23 (PTI): Australian hockey legend Rick Charlesworth has expressed his willingness to coach the Indian team after an official hinted at appointment of a foreign coach in the backdrop of the sides below-par performance in the Champions Trophy. Charlesworth, who led the Australian side to glory in the 1986 World Cup, said on Saturday he is ready to accept the job if any offer comes his way. Coaching the Indian team will be a challenge. I am not chasing the job, but am willing to consider any offer made in this regard, said the 51-year-old. A performance consultant and a man of varied interests and deeds, Charlesworth said a lot could be done to lift Indian hockey to the highs of yesteryears. But any assignment should be long term of say five years, during which I can also groom Indian coaches who can then take over. Basically, you need to put a structure in place that can sustain itself, said the former captain. Charlesworth also coached the Australian womens team between 1993 and 2001, during which they won the World Cup, Olympics and Champions Trophy.  Copyright

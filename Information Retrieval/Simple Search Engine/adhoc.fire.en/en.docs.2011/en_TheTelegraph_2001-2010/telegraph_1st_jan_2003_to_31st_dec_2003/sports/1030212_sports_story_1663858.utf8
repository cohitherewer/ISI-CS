The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Underdone Kenya brace for SA fire
Proteas may modify rotation policy Potchefstroom: Kenyas under-exposed cricketers are unlikely to extend a fired-up South Africa at the North West Stadium Wednesday.Kenyan manager Mehmood Quraishy admitted it shaped up as an unequal contest. We are handicapped because we do not get enough international cricket, he said. Quraishy pointed out that Kenya had defeated two South African provincial teams, Border and Eastern Province, in warm-up matches last week. South Africas defeat Sunday means the plan to rotate players in their squad will be modified. All four men who did not play against the West Indies were initially expected to play against Kenya, but skipper Shaun Pollock said after the West Indies match that the first priority was to get points on the board. Some adjustment to the South African side is still likely, however, as even a below-strength team should be able to beat Kenya, even though the minnows have a core of experienced players.Skipper Steve Tikolo, a high-quality batsman, and all rounder Thomas Odoyo have played in all 51 of their countrys matches. Maurice Odumbe has missed only one match, while Kennedy Otieno and Martin Suji have played 49 times. Jonty Rhodes had an X-Ray on Monday after aggravating an old injury to his right index finger while fielding against the West Indies. But no serious damage was revealed and he was able to bat in a voluntary practice in the afternoon.

 Atwal slips in first round
New Delhi: Arjun Atwal, vying for the Asian PGA Order of Merit title, disappointed in the opening round of the season-ending Volvo Masters in Bangkok with a tied 35-place finish. But making up for Atwals lacklustre show was countrymate Jyoti Randhawa who overcame a double bogey to return a first round card of four-under 67. He was tied for the sixth position at the season-ending $ 500,000 event being played at the par-71 Bangkok Golf Club. According to information received here, Ted Purdy assumed the lead, courtesy a superb round of nine-under 62 which also handed him a new course record at the Bangkok Golf Club. Three strokes behind the leader at six-under 65, were Pablo de Olmo and Lin Keng-chi. The duo of Pat Giles and Gary Rusnak were tied fourth at 66 apiece. Atwal, who created history Monday by becoming the first Indian to qualify for the US PGA Tour, shot an even-par 71 to tie for the 35th position along with Arjun Singh and challenger for the 2003 APGA Order of Merit title Zhang Lian-wei. Amandeep Johl and Harmeet Kahlon, however, finished higher up at tied-18th place after playing to two-under 69 each. Meanwhile, Daniel Chopra who finished sixth at the USPGA Tours qualifying school, fired a one-over 73 to tie for 43rd place. Randhawa had a great outward journey, with a hattrick of birdies on the sixth, seventh and eighth placing him at three-under at the lemon break. However, an unfortunate double bogey on the tenth undid a large amount of the good work. Randhawa birdied the 12th and after dropping a shot on the 15th, went on to return another string of birdies on his three closing holes. (PTI)  Copyright

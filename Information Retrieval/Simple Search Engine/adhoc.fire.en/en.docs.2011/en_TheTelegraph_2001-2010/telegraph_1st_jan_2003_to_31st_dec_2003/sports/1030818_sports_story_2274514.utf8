The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chelsea pip Liverpool
Liverpool: Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink grabbed a late winner to give big-spending Chelsea a 2-1 victory at Liverpool in their opening game of the Premier League season on Sunday. The substitute drove a low shot into the Liverpool net after 87 minutes in front of the clubs new Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich. Liverpool looked to have salvaged a draw when Michael Owen scored controversially with a twice-taken penalty after 79 minutes. Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron, one of the new signings by Chelsea, had given the London club a 25th-minute lead. In other matches, Leeds United drew 2-2 with New Castle United, while Manchester City blanked Charlton Athletic 3-0. Nicolas Anelka, Antoine Sibierski and Sun Jihai scored for City. Mark Viduka and Alan Smith had given Leeds a 2-0 lead but Alan Shearer scored twice to ensure a draw for Newcastle.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

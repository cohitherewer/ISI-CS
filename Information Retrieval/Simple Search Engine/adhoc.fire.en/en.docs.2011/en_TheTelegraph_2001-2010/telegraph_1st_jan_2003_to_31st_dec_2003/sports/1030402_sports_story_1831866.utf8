The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zidane has mixed feelings over captaincy
Palermo (Sicily): Zinedine Zidane enjoys wearing the France captains armband but does not like attending the pre-match news conferences. Yes I like the captains job. But what I like much less is being here in front of you, the shy midfield playmaker told reporters on Tuesday. Asked if he found it difficult to speak in public, Zidane said: its not that easy. Its not what I like. The soft-spoken Real Madrid player said he has to talk more to his international teammates since being handed the armband last week. I have to express myself more than I usually do when Im with my club or when Im playing for France, he said. But its about 10 years Im professional so I think I can do this. Zidane is replacing regular captain Marcel Desailly who has not been picked due to injury problems. French coach Jacques Santini was not surprised at how Zidane adapted to the captains role. Zidane doesnt need to have the armband to be a great player, Santini said. He never tried to avoid his duties and when he is in such shape, there is not much to say.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

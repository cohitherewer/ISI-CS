The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roddick loses
Bratislava: Andy Roddicks 19-match winning streak came to juddering halt on Slovakian clay on Friday as the US Open champion lost 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 4-6 to Dominik Hrbaty in the Davis Cup. Roddick started his first match since winning his maiden Grand Slam in the same way he closed out that victory at Flushing Meadows  with an ace  but was powerless to prevent Slovakia taking a 1-0 lead in their World Group playoff tie. The power game that served the world No. 2 so well in New York was of little use on the slow clay court Slovakia laid down for the tie and the boisterous, and often rude, home crowd played its part in his downfall. Roddick had not lost since going down to Tim Henman in August. (Reuters)  Copyright

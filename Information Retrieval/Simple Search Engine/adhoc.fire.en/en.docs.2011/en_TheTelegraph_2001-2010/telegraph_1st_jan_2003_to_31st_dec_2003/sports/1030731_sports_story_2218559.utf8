The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India A struggle
London: Three half-centuries propped up Warwickshires batting as the hosts finished Day I of their four-day tie against India A on 302 for four at Edgbaston Wednesday. Put into to bat, the home side piled on their runs with the help of half-centuries from Michael Powell (68), Ian Trott (78) and Ian Bell (71 batting) as the India A bowlers struggled to maintain a good line and length. At stumps, Tony Frost was giving Bell company on 30. For the visitors, Laxmipathy Balaji was the most successful bowler with two wickets for 45 runs.  (PTI)  Copyright

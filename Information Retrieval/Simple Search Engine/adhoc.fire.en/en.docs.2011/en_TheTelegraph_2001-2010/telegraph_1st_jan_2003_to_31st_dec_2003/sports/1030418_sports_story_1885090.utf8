 Sachin on a new drive 
 Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai Thursday. (AFP) Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar may soon be seen in a new role  as a competitor in the first leg of the MRF-MAI Formule Mondiale championship (special class) to be held at Chennai on July 5 and 6. Speaking to reporters on Thursday after test driving a four-stroke kart, Tendulkar said he was almost certain to take part in the race in Chennai. Asked how he felt after the test drive, Tendulkar said, It was a very exciting experience. Earlier, I had driven while shooting for an MRF ad but today it was altogether a different experience as I was driving on the tracks. To a query whether he was planing to take up driving full time, Tendulkar, who seemed to enjoy every minute of the five laps he drove, said it is a fine experience to drive at full speed when there are no obstacles on the way. But for me cricket is a serious commitment while karting is just a passion. You tend to get pretty serious while playing cricket, while karting is fun and you can release all the pent-up pressure, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

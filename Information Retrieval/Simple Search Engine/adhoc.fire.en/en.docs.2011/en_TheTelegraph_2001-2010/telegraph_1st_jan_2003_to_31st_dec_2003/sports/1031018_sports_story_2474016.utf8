The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Iles brings a touch of class 
Hyderabad: Algerias Salim Iles will lead seven medallists from the recent All-Africa Games as part of the 35-strong swimming contingent from Africa in the inaugural Afro-Asian Games beginning here on October 24. The 28-year-old Illes claimed the 100m freestyle gold in Abuja. The France-based Illes was a semi-finalist at the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000 but beat double Olympic medallist Pieter van den Hoogenband the following year in the French Trials in Chamaliers. At the end of last month, he was ranked No. 11 in the world in 100m freestyle and No. 16 in 50m freestyle. On the womens side, South Africans Christine Zwiegers (100m freestyle silver) and Lauren Sparg (50m butterfly silver) are the medallists from the All-Africa Games. (Agencies)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Iran slam 4 past Bangladesh
 FROM A CORESPONDENT Jamshedpur: Iran blanked an inexperienced Bangladesh 4-0 in a one-sided match of the JRD Tata Cup international invitational football meet on Thursday. The Bangla boys defence just caved in against the sheer power of the Iranians. Iran drew first blood in the seventh minute when midfielder Mohammed Niknafs sent in a gentle cross from the right to Milad Midavoodi who tapped in the lead from the right of goalkeeper Mohammed Pruzzaman. Skipper Milad Noori made amends three minutes after the break when he slid in the cross from the right. The introduction of Ali Reza Beghernia soon after the break added zip to Irans attack. Soon it was 3-0 when Hamed Rasouli converted a cross from the left in the 67th minute. There was barrage of attacks from Iran after the third goal and more looked imminent. The misses notwithstanding, Iran slammed in the fourth and final goal in the 70th minute when Mohsen Afrosian converted the cross from the right.  Copyright

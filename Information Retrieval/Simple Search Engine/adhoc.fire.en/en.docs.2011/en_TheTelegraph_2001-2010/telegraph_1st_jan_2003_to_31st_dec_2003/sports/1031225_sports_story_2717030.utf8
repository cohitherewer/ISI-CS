The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its time to cut down on errors, feel rival coaches
 - Sandeep Patil justifies Munaf Patel inclusion despite expensive outing against Lankans  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Coach Sandeep Patil explains a point to Amit Bhandari at the Eden on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Its India versus Pakistan in the Asian A Championship at Eden Gardens on Thursday. It is likely to be a high-voltage affair and the teams concerned are looking at keeping errors to the minimum. Both teams lost to the high-flying Sri Lankans despite posting an identical 300 in their first games. The Indians came up with a forgettable outing with the ball and also while fielding in their opening game against Russel Arnolds team. These areas need attention. We hope the mistakes are not repeated, said India A coach Sandeep Patil. His Pakistan A counterpart Naveed Anjum didnt say anything different. The Sri Lanka match was the first one we played after a while. We didnt get our act together and hope to get it right tomorrow. Anjum admitted his team bowled far too many loose balls at a crucial stage of the match and identified leg-spinner Mansoor Amjads failure to be a key factor. He did well on our A teams tour of South Africa. He was erratic against Sri Lanka but even if he gets three for 50 from ten overs, our job will be done. Patil felt India are better off batting first. Certain teams chase well and some others do better while setting targets. Its all about how one adjusts with conditions if and when they change. Patil justified retaining Munaf Patel, who went for 49 in five overs against Sri Lanka, in the XI. He is probably the least experienced bowlers in all the teams playing here. Considering that, it has to be said that his first class record is still pretty good. Anjum reckoned that even 300 is not going to be safe in the on-going tri-series. The pitch is zabardast for batting. We will have to get something well above that to be sure of victory.  Umpire hospitalised Former umpire Subrata Banerjee has been hospitalised after suffering a serious waist injury following a fall on the staircase during Tuesdays match against Pakistan A and Sri Lanka A. Banerjee, who has retired from the state and other panels concerned, was appointed to assist the umpires in the on-going tri-series. He fell awkwardly while leaving the Match Referees room. He has been hospitalised with a fractured waist. The BCCI is reportedly taking care of the expenses.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, October 11, 2003  Curtain comes down on eventful season  BY STAR RACER 				 										Calcutta: The track played true in spite of taking heavy pounding from the week-long rain as the curtain came down on an eventful 15-day monsoon season on Friday. The racing during the season was quite tough and winner spotting an arduous task, leaving the the club management to harden their attitude for a spate of suspensions during the last three weeks. 				 										Stewards showed no mercy even for the top bracket jockeys, leave alone those who survived by the day. The afternoon itself saw the likes of Som Singhs and E. Smiths getting the wrong end of the stick for crimes committed in recent past. Amarpreet Singh, however, was lucky to have escaped with a fine of Rs 3,000 in view of his role that sent two of his fellow professionals  S. Shanker and K. Suresh  to Woodlands. While partnering Perfect Vision to victory, Singh had cut across Castle Moon who went on to tighten the field, particularly, Shankers Anacott. Shanker was, therefore, unseated as Anacott came a cropper while Suresh, on My Dancer being directly behind, followed the suit. According to the nursing home  sources, both jockeys are under observation. Shanker is,  however, still under a state of shock while the gravity  of Sureshs back injury is yet to be determined. Both horses  had to be destroyed. Monsoons toppers

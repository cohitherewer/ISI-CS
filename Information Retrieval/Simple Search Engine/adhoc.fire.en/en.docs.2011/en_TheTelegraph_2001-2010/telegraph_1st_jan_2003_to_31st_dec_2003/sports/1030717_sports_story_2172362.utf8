The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India seek lost glory
New Delhi: Hockey, once Indias national game, is making a comeback after years in the doldrums thanks to a talented young side who are starting to win again in Asian style. Recent impressive victories in tournaments in Australia and Germany have raised hopes of a return to Olympic hockey glory in a country where cricket is now the national sporting obsession. Indias mens hockey players slumped to seventh in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and came 10th at last years World Cup in Kuala Lumpur after a poor start which led to the coachs sacking midway through the tournament. But a youthful side beat hosts Australia 5-3 in the Sydney final in May after an emotional victory over eternal rivals Pakistan during the double-legged tournament. Then followed victory in a four-nation tournament in Hamburg last month, where India lost 2-3 to Germany before downing both Spain and Argentina. India are now gearing up enthusiastically for the elite Champions Trophy six-nation event in Amsterdam next month against world champions Germany, Olympic gold medallists Netherlands, Australia, Argentina and Pakistan. It is a good start in our build-up, said coach Rajinder Singh, a member of Indias gold medal-winning squad at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Lots of work still needs to be done, but these victories have given the boys a lot of confidence. After dominating the game from the 1930s until the 1970s India have achieved little of note since winning their eighth and last Olympic gold in 1980. But Singh, who coached India to the junior World Cup in 2001, has successfully drafted in most of the members of that squad since taking over the senior team last year. Last week the hockey team received an extra boost when they found a new sponsor in the Sahara Group, who also support the national cricket team, and signed an eight-year deal.I am confident we can live up to this hype, said captain Dhanraj Pillay, Indias most capped player. Zafar Iqbal, a former player said the return to the old Asian approach was long overdue. We never mastered the European style, he said.  (Reuters)  Copyright

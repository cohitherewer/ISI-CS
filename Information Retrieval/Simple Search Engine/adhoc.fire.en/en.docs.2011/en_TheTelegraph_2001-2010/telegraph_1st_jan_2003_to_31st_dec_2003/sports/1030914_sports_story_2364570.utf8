The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India B power past India A
 India As Anil Kumble and Sachin Tendulkar seem to be at a loss in the face of Yuvraj Singhs 81-ball unbeaten 111 in the Challenger Series tie in Bangalore on Saturday. (AFP) Bangalore, Sept. 13 (PTI): Dinesh Mongia and Yuvraj Singh hit centuries as Rahul Dravids India B defeated the Anil Kumble-led India A by 82 runs in the TVS Challenger Series on Saturday. It was Mongias day as he grabbed four wickets for 31 too. Yuvraj and Mongia shared the Man of the Match award. The two teams will meet again, in Sundays final since Sourav Gangulys India Senior had earlier been knocked out following two defeats  against India A and India B. Opting to bat, India B amassed a mammoth 340 for two in 50 overs. Their innings was marked by three century partnerships, including an unbroken third wicket stand of 121 off just 73 balls between Yuvraj and V.S. Thilak Naidu. Showers during the break delayed the start of India As innings and when play got underway, the target was revised to 308 runs in 40 overs. India A were all out for 225 in 35 .2 overs. Sachin Tendulkar, who opened the innings with Gautham Gambhir, started in whirlwind fashion and smashed a six and four fours before playing a loose shot and giving an easy catch to Dravid at mid-off. He made 22 off 14 balls. Yuvrajs explosive 81-ball 111 was studded with nine fours and four sixes. On 92 at the start of the final over, Yuvraj plundered 19 off Irfan Pathan. Mongia, capitalising on two lives that he got  on zero and on 72, flayed the rival attack by smashing 19 fours off 118 balls in his knock of 121.  Copyright

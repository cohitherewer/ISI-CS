		 Thursday, May 29, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Santiago: Chile and Colo Colo striker Ivan Zamorano said on Tuesday that he will retire this year.				 																																	The only detail which I still havent decided is the date: either now, after the Apertura (championship), or at the end of the year, the 36-year-old former Inter Milan and Real Madrid player told website Vivefutbol.				 																																	My idea is to leave as a champion with Colo Colo.				 																																	Zamorano, who scored 34 goals in 67 internationals, returned to Chile the club he supported as a boy at the start of the year after playing abroad for 14 years. 				 																																	Although he has scored six goals, Zamorano has been plagued by an old knee injury and his team were knocked out of the South American Libertadores Cup in the first round.				 																																	Moscow: Russias national team will play a select side, made up of its premier leagues top foreign players, next month in a charity match to raise funds in the fight against racism.				 																																	Alexander Tukmanov, executive director of the Russian Football Union, told Reuters on Wednesday that European soccers governing body Uefa had already approved the idea of staging the match to be played at Moscows Lokomotiv stadium on June 30. Russia coach Valery Gazzayev will pick the players for the national side while the foreign team will be selected by fan balloting. Russian soccer has been plagued by racial tensions in recent years since the influx of players from Africa and Latin America.				 																																	Perth: Former Test bowler Wayne Clark has been appointed as coach of Western Australia for a second time. Clark signed a one-year-deal with the Warriors after they sacked their former coach, ex-test batsmen Mike Veletta.Clark, who was sacked himself by Yorkshire last season, coached Western Australia for six seasons between 1994 and 2001, winning two first-class and two one-day titles. 				 																																	Barcelona: Former Barcelona captain Josep Guardiola has agreed to return to the Catalan club to take up the post of sporting director if advertising executive Lluis Bassat wins next months presidential elections.				 																																	I have the great satisfaction of announcing that we have reached a definitive agreement with Pep Guardiola that will see him become the sporting director of FC Barcelona if we win the elections, Bassat said on his website on Wednesday.				 																																	The agreement with the 32-year-old midfielder should act as a major boost to Bassats bid to become Barcelona president.				 																																	Despite leaving Barca on a free transfer to join Italian side Brescia two years ago, Guardiola remains one of the clubs most widely respected former players and his involvement with Bassat is certain to bring the candidate increased support.				 																																	Edinburgh: A second-half strike from Ryan Nelsen earned New Zealand a 1-1 draw against Scotland in a friendly international on Tuesday.				 																																	Stevie Crawford fired the hosts ahead early on but Nelsen gave New Zealand, ranked 51st in the Fifa standings 13 places above Scotland, a lift before next months Confederations Cup with a 47th minute equaliser.				 																																	n Tennis, French Open  Live from 3.30 pm on TEN Sports n Cricket, Australia vs West Indies  Fifth ODI, highlights from 10.30 pm on STAR Sports n Soccer, Champions League final  from 2 pm and 8.30 pm on ESPN n Soccer, Spanish League  Highlights from 9 am on ESPN

 Shayne OConnor quits
Dunedin: Bowler Shayne OConnor, considered a likely prospect for New Zealands team to tour Sri Lanka, announced his retirement from international and first-class cricket Thursday. The 29-year-old OConnor said his massive decision to retire resulted from the uncertainty over selection and income, the reluctance to make long tours and the continuing toll on his body. There is the waiting around on selections to see what happens and the influence they have on my career and income. There are the ups and downs which go with them, said OConnor. Ive just had enough of dealing with those. Ive had enough of pushing my body in training and I feel I have to do that to be good enough. Ive lost the desire to go on long tours and to put up with some of the conditions they have to. OConnor said he had not spoken to the national selectors but he had informed New Zealand Cricket chief executive Martin Snedden of his decision to retire. I never wanted to be just a first-class cricketer  I always wanted to be an international cricketer, he said. OConnor, who missed last season with a severe patella knee tendon injury, said he was thrilled with his last season for domestic side Otago in which he claimed 42 wickets at an average of 18.71. I definitely think I had at least another year in me at international level, he said. But Ive got an opportunity to get a business up and running in Alexandra and hopefully thats going to set me up for the rest of my life. OConnor and his wife, Camille, plan to set up an accommodation lodge in Otago where his wifes family live. OConnor played 19 Tests, taking 53 wickets at an average of 32.52. He played 38 one-day Internationals, claiming 46 wickets at 30.34.  (AP)  Copyright

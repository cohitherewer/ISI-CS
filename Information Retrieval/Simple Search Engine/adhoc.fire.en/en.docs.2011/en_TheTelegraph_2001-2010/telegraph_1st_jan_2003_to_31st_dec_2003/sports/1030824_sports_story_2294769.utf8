The Telegraph - Calcutta
 It will be a different match today  -What is the point in scoring 9 goals and conceding 14?  The basic idea is to win...
 Stickwork / Gurbax Singh Baljit Singh Saini and Pakistan captain  Nadeem Ahmad vie for the ball in Amstelveen on Friday.  (AP)  Now that India are up against  Pakistan again, for the bronze match in the Champions Trophy,  expect a new match Sunday. It was a great victory over Pakistan  in the last league match, but on Sunday India must forget  that 7-4 victory and start afresh. We must remember that  we will find a different Pakistan onfield for the medal-match. In the analysis of the championships  league stage, I see India having played true to potential  only twice  first being 15 minutes in their opening match  versus Holland, and second in the 19 minutes blitz in which  we beat Pakistan in the last league tie. That means we have  the potential to put up such excellent shows, and also that  we are not using this potential to its fullest. There is  immense scope for improvement. I also feel that if there is one  thing that is holding the country back it is the tendency  to get into fights and wasting time, energy, and more importantly,  the winning edge. This has happened on a number of occasions,  and India were on such occasions. I find this strange, because  such emotional outbursts do take a lot away from a winning  mindset  if you are yellow-carded and out of the arena,  how are you helping the team? Some level of discipline is  urgently needed. To this extent, I would say the  experienced and superstar Dhanraj Pillay has not been able  to control his boys well enough. In the same breath, though  I would want to say cheers to Jugraj Singh and his bravery.  It was strategy, but it was also the courage of this young  player that saw to it that the worlds best penalty corner  specialist Sohail Abbas could convert only one of the six  penalty corners that he tried.  On the occasion he scored, Jugraj  was sitting out with a booking. And Jugraj scored, too,  despite injuries. What I am scared of overconfidence  seeping into the Indian team Sunday. This is a team in the  making, tenderly inexperienced. The fear is of their losing  concentration that that India have rarely of late been consistent  in a tournament. Flashes of brilliance wont help in winning  a cup. Till before the last match it  had been a dismal and frustrating show. The team had performed  poorly in the sense that it had not shown up either individually  or as a team. It has always been a bits-and-pieces show,  with no consistency. Indias performance went downhill  after the defeat to Holland where, after being under pressure  in the first half, India took a commanding lead of 3-0.  Then the players started disputing even the slightest wrong  decision of the umpires. The concentration went out of the  window. In international sports, one has to take the bad  and good decision with the same temperament. Leading 3-0,  India conceded three within a span of seven minutes and  lost 3-4.  What was really disheartening  was the players who were in the forefront of protests were  all seniors like Dhanraj, Baljit Singh Dhillon, Baljit Saini,  Jugraj. Pillay got a yellow card and the team went to pieces. Versus Germany, I thought the  players had learnt their lesson. Germanys development team  was the weakest, but proved a tough nut to crack for India.  It was a close 3-2 verdict, the winning goal coming in the  dying minutes.  Third match against Australia  was probably the worst. India were completely outplayed  and outmanoeuvred by the quick-moving, quick-thinking Aussies.  It was shocking to see how two goals from went from the  right post. As a defender myself I wonder what this Indian  defence is up to. There was no body-marking of the Aussie  left flank.  Small pressures on the Indian  defence see the players scatter and fall like nine-pins.  The only player to excel in this match was probably Devesh  Chowhan. After having lost two of the three matches I thought  India would come out guns blazing and regain some pride  by defeating Argentina convincingly.  But again one found the players  lethargic and laden-footed. Argentina forwards like Bram  Lomans beat the Indian defenders at will.  Captain Dhanraj Pillay has been  a big disappointment. Age seems to be telling on him, I  suppose. Also, the strategy that was being employed by coach  Rajinder Singh did flummox me. Playing four forwards  Prabhjot,  Gagan Ajit or Deepak Thakur, Pillay and Dhillon.  All seem to run to the left flank.  Pillay seems to be playing behind the forwards  in front  of the half backs. On the right flank, time and gain I find  Baljit Saini covering up as a right out. May I ask how far  is it possible for a right half to cover up as a right wing  and right half? Pillay should be playing forward,  up ahead, and India should have a regular right wing.  As I feared before the tournament  started, that it is the control of midfield that will count  much in modern hockey. It has been the midfield mainly which  has let India down.  There is no consistency there.  What is use of playing open attacking hockey and scoring  nine goals, while conceding 14, and losing 3 out of 4 matches?  I am all for playing free flowing, attractive, enjoyable,  attacking hockey.  But the primary aim is to win  also. And I believe more in a 1-0 win than in a 3-2 win.  These are things one has to remember versus Pakistan Sunday.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Boca bag crown 
Yokohama: Boca Juniors beat AC Milan 3-1 in a penalty shoot-out following an absorbing 1-1 draw after extra time to win the World Club Cup on Sunday. Midfielder Raul Cascini blasted in the decisive penalty after Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf and Alessandro Costacurta all missed for Milan. Jon Dahl Tomasson put Milan ahead in the 24th minute, calmly sliding the ball under Roberto Abbondanzieri from eight metres following a superb through ball by Andrea Pirlo. But Boca were back on level terms five minutes later through Matias Donnet. (Reuters)  Copyright

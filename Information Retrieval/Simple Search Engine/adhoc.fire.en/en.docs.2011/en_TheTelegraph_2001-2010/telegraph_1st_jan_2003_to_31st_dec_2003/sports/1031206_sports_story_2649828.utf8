 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The CAB working committee Friday condemned the way Assam were denied full points against Bengal in the recently-concluded Ranji Trophy match. The house felt though Assam did not inflict an outright defeat on Bengal, courtesy, a shameful umpiring decision by K. Murali and S.V. Ramani, it only dealt a blow to the image of the association. The CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya was also asked by the working committee members to look into the horrible performance of Bengal in the Ranji Trophy this season. The president has promised he will look into the matter and will sit with the team management before Bengal play their next game against Hyderabad on Tuesday.

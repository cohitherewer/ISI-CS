The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mumbai attitude Ghavris trump card
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Mumbai gharana is set to enliven Bengal cricket. Karsan Ghavri has decided to fall back on the lessons learnt in his own backyard in an effort to lift the sagging morale of the state team. The players must develop a feeling for the state. There has to be a sense of belonging and they must take immense pride from being able to represent the state. Bengal should learn from Mumbais experiences this season. The players played their hearts out for the state and finally their efforts bore fruit, Ghavri said on Tuesday. In his first day in office after taking charge as Bengal coach, Ghavri said a team should never be judged through last seasons performances. One year you may not be able to do well. Theres no need to panic. It has happened to Mumbai. This season they emerged champions after failing to qualify from the zonal stage the year before. Its all part of the game and any downfall should always be taken in the right spirit. Weve got to look forward to the new season with a positive attitude, the former India allrounder added. The attitude, Ghavri felt, was most important and, here too, he will help the Bengal players draw inspiration from Mumbais batsmen. The players should never feel satisfied. The 30s and 40s should always be converted into 70s and 80s. The 70s to hundreds and more. There should be no limits to their aspirations. The players should learn to occupy the crease as much as possible. The target is Ranji Trophy. Every match is important. Each players contribution will count a great deal towards achieving that goal, he explained. The coach would have wished to practice full strength but that seemed unlikely. Rohan Gavaskar will be available by the first week of August. If the others are here early, it will definitely make the team stronger. If not, I will have to do with the younger players for the KSCA meet and Buchi Babu tournament. It will also give me an opportunity to get a firsthand knowledge of their temperament. CAB joint secretary Bablu Kolay informed that those playing league cricket in England, have been asked to make themselves available at the conditioning camp as early as possible. No deadline has, however, been set.  Copyright

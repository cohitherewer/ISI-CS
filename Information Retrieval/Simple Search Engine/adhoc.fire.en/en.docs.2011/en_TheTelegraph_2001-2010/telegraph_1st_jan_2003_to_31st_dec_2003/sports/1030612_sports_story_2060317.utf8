 Klitschko breakfast ready for Lewis
 Lennox Lewis promised meal has taken a while to cook up Berlin: Lennox Lewis once told the Klitschko brothers he could have one of them for breakfast and the other for lunch. Now breakfast is ready and the heavyweight world champion must be careful he does not choke on it. Vitali Klitschko, the older of the two Ukrainian brothers at 31, will have a point to prove when he challenges the Briton for the World Boxing Council (WBC) title on June 21 in Los Angeles. As always, brother Vladimir, 27, will be watching from ringside at the Staples Center, hoping that he, too, will soon get a chance to prove his worth. It was the other way round three years ago, when Lewis was first introduced to the Klitschko pair on the set of Hollywood picture Oceans Eleven. Vitali was watching as Vladimir filmed a fight scene with Lewis and both brothers wished then that, one day, they could do battle with the Briton for real. It was during the film, about a daring plan to rob three Las Vegas casinos during a fight night, that Lewis made his remarks about the prospect of having the Klitschko brothers on his menu. The meal has taken a while to cook up. Lewis, who called off a contracted bout with the elder Klitschko brother earlier this year, was said to be considering a more lucrative re-match against Mike Tyson, whom he destroyed last year. The Klitschko camp were well aware that the 37-year-old Briton was bound to retire sooner rather than later and were relieved to hear the WBC say last month that Lewis had to fight Vitali, his top-rated contender, before the end of this year. But no firm date was set and Lewis began concentrating on his June 21 fight against Canadian Kirk Johnson while Vitali warmed up for a non-title bout against American Cedric Boswell on the same bill. Then Johnson pulled out injured and everything changed fast. Vitali, who lists politics, literature and chess among his hobbies, had been waiting years for such an opportunity. I was surprised when Lennox chose to fight Johnson and I was surprised when Johnson got injured, he said. Now Im even more surprised. On June 21 my life-long dream will come true. It will be a super fight.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

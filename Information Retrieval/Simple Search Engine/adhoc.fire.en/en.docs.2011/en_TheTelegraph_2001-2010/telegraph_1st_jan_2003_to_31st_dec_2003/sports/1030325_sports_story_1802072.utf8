				 																																	Perth: Brightly coloured flowers were laid at a cross marking the spot where Australian-born English cricketer Ben Hollioake died just over a year ago.				 																																	The 24-year-old Hollioake was killed when his Porsche slammed into a brick wall after exiting from a freeway off-ramp at south Perth on March 23 last year.				 																																	His 22-year-old girlfriend Janaya Scholten is still undergoing rehabilitation for severe injuries. A white cross at the crash site was covered on Monday with flowers, which had been placed around a small tribute written on cloth and held to the ground by rocks.				 																																	Ben, you are a true hero, there arent many like you. With such talent and promise, it is devastating that your life has been cut short. You are sadly missed by so many, the tribute read.				 																																	London: England captain David Beckham has slammed rumours that a player rift might be splitting Manchester United.				 																																	An off-field love triangle which saw United winger Ryan Giggs and Dave Gardner, who is Beckhams best friend, swap ex-girlfriends threatened the friendship of all three. It was alleged Beckham and Phil Neville had snubbed the welsh winger. But Beckham says the United players do not take notice of rumours.				 																																	What happens outside the game doesnt affect what we think of each other, he told the Sun newspaper. What people have to try to remember is that most of us have been together for 10 years.				 																																	We know each other inside out. Rumours never upset us. People try to upset the bond we have, but that wont happen. Whatever people think, we all get on very well with each other. No one has a problem with anyone else.

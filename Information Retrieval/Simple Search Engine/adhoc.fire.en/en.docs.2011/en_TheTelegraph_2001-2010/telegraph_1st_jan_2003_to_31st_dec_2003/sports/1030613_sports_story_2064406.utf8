The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shaky start by Woods
Olympia Fields: Defending champion Tiger Woods started and finished poorly to fire a level-par 70 in the US Open first round on Thursday as Justin Leonard and Jay Don Blake set the pace. Woods, bidding for his third US Open crown in four years and the ninth major of his career, initially struggled on the difficult greens at Olympia Fields Country Club and was one over par after 14 holes. In overcast conditions, he then missed a birdie chance from 12 feet on seven, scrambled a par on eight and bogeyed nine after finding a greenside bunker and failing to get up and down. That left the 27-year-old four strokes off the early lead, jointly held by Leonard, after 16 holes, and Blake, after 13.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

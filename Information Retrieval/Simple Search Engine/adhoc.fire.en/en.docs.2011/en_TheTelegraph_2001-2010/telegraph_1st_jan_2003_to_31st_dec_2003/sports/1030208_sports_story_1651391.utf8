The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warnes legacy for Hogg
 Warne: The tutor Cape Town: Before bidding goodbye to one-day cricket, legendary spinner Shane Warne wants to hand down his tricks to promising understudy Brad Hogg. Im trying to teach him all my one-day tricks, the slider being the first in the agenda. The thought of the two of us bowling together is fantastic, Warne said, disclosing his plans to pass on to Hogg as many of his deliveries as possible. Slider has been one of his greatest weapons, a front of the hand delivery that has been a potent wicket-taker. Warne, who will quit one-dayers after the World Cup, feels Hogg can be his long-term replacement in the limited overs team and a future Test teammate. In a Test he could be a nice foil as someone who spins the ball the other way, he said. Australias plan to play the two wrist spinners in their first choice World Cup squad has excited both the players and added a fascinating, unorthodox dimension to the attack. Hes got a very good wrong-un. Not too many people can pick it, were working on just spinning his leg break a bit more and trying to minimise his bad balls, Warne said. As an all-rounder, Hoggy is as good as anyone else. His batting is a bonus and his fieldings great. I think hes perfectly suited to this form of the game, Warne said. Taking 12 wickets in eight games in the recent VB series, the under-rated Hogg is the discovery of the one-day summer.  (PTI)  Copyright

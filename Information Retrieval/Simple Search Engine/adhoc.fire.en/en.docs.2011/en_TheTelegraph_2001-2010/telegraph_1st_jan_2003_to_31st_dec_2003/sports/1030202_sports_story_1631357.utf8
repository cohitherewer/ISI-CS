The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mohapatra ton powers Orissa
 Ahmedabad, Feb. 1 (PTI): Orissa opener B.B.C.C. Mohapatra cracked an unbeaten 149 as the visitors scored 244 for one at the end of the rain-affected first day of their Ranji Trophy group A match against Gujarat at Motera here on Saturday. The sudden showers on Friday evening left the pitch extremely wet, delaying the start of play by at least three hours. However, after opting to bat, Orissa made up for the bad performances in the last four matches, taking the Gujarat bowlers to task as openers Mohapatra and Shiv Sundar Das (60) piled up 174 runs. Mohapatra plundered 149 off 194 balls aided by 19 boundaries and five sixes in his 237 minute stay at the crease. Das also slammed eight boundaries and one six during his 84-ball knock before airing one Bhavin Mehta delivery into the hands of Lalit Patel. Mehta and Shyamal Bhatt were punished by the Orissa openers, conceding 112 runs in their eight overs each.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav led after Sehwag backed out
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Akash Chopra plays a cover drive in Hobart on Friday. Chopra is batting on 12. (AFP)  Hobart: Eventually, Sourav Ganguly not only  played the three-dayer versus Australia A, but led the side.  According to the arrangement worked out on Thursday night,  Virender Sehwag was to have captained even if Sourav played.  Overnight, that changed. Actually, Sehwag himself said  it would be odd if I played under him and that he wouldnt  feel comfortable... So, I was left with no choice, Sourav  told The Telegraph. With the captain deciding to  play, Anil Kumble got a break.  Meanwhile, Deep Dasgupta had a good day behind the  stumps and looked comfortable while batting towards the  end of the first day. A big score, one understands, will  bring him into reckoning for the third Test (from December  26). Parthiv Patel isnt a certainty.  Copyright

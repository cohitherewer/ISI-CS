The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jason Gillespie has a score to settle
 - Series vs india  Gillespie wants to avenge 01 Chennai Test loss Brisbane: Left-handed opener Justin Langer is visualising the opening over of the 2003 World Cup final and wants Australia to get going in a similar way against India in the first Test which starts at the Gabba here Thursday. I would definitely like to see the first over of the World Cup final, said Langer. Zaheer Khan was pumped up but within six balls, the momentum of the game had turned our way. Indians were blown away in that match this March by the Aussies after Adam Gilchrist took 15 runs off Zaheer Khans opening over, a method Australia seem to have tried in every subsequent encounter against India. But fast bowler Jason Gillespie, returning to the squad after an injury lay-off, is looking at different reasons to motivate himself for the series ahead. The loss in the Chennai Test (2001 series) was very disappointing. It will act as a motivation. So we are going to try our best to win, said Gillespie, looking lean and mean with a scraggly beard. It was very disappointing but the sun still came out the next day, he recalled the series in which India, after losing the Mumbai Test, rallied superbly to win in Calcutta and Chennai. Langer though was not dismissive of the Indian attack and felt the bowlers could deliver, provided they got their line and length right. The feeling about their pace attack is they lack a bit of experience. But Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh are world class. You only have to look at their records. Kumble is a great bowler and we dont use that word lightly, Langer said. Its a good, young, talented side and have players who could come up under any conditions. You have got to be on your toes. Gillespie too agreed with the assessment and felt India could be a competitive side this summer. They dont depend on Sachin Tendulkar alone. I think they have got some quality players. Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag are all very good players. (PTI)  Copyright

 Shoaib release put on hold
Karachi: Pakistan have put on hold a decision to release fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar to play for Durham after the second Test against Bangladesh which starts on Wednesday. Chief selector Aamer Sohail said on Sunday that the injury to Mohammed Sami, which ruled him out of the rest of the Bangladesh series, has forced them to delay Akhtars release. We have not decided anything as yet but Sami is being sent to Lahore for treatment and we will know in a week what the position is, Sohail said. Pakistan called up Akhtar from Durham after the injury to Sami. But Durham released him on the condition that he would be back after the second Test against Bangladesh. The Pakistan academy team will return from South Africa next week and we will have more options before us. But until the team returns and until we know how long Sami is going to take to recover, Akhtars release is on hold, Sohail said. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Rameez Raja said if the selectors wanted Akhtar for the third and final Test than the board would first have to speak to Durham. So far the selectors have not discussed this issue with us. But if there is a change in plans, first we have to inform Durham and let them know our problem, he said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

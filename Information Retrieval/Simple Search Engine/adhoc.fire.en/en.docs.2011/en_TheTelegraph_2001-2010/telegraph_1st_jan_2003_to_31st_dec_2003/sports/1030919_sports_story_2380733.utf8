The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Historic first by Sussex
Hove: Sussex clinched the County championship for the first time in their history on Thursday, finally ending a 113-year wait to claim the biggest prize in English domestic cricket. Meanwhile, Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed became the first bowler in five years to take 100 wickets in an English County season. Mushtaq claimed his 100th scalp of the summer on Wednesday when he bowled Leicestershires Australian Brad Hodge with the last ball before lunch on the first day of the Countys last match of the summer. The Pakistani is the first bowler to take 100 wickets since West Indies quick Courtney Walsh, playing for Gloucestershire and Englands Andrew Caddick, playing for Somerset, achieved the feat in 1998. No spinner has achieved it since Anil Kumble did it for Leicestershire in 1995. After returning figures of four for 71 on Wednesday to lift his seasons wicket total to 103, Mushtaq revealed that he wants to play for Sussex for two more seasons. After dismissing Leicestershire for 179 in 69.5 overs on Wednesday, Sussex resumed on Thursday on 137 for one with a target of 300 runs to secure the three batting points needed to ensure they could not be caught by nearest rivals Lancashire. Leicestershire bowlers were powerless to prevent Sussex from passing the 300 mark shortly after lunch. (AFP)  Copyright

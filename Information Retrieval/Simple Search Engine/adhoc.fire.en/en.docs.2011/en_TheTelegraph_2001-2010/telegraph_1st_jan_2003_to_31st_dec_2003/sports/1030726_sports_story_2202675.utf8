The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Second day washed out
Birmingham: Persistent rain washed out Day II of the first Test between England and South Africa on Friday. Overnight rain continued throughout the morning and into the afternoon at Edgbaston before the umpires called off the days play at 14.15 GMT. South Africa, who dominated the opening day of the five-Test series by amassing 398 for one, will still hope to force the pace on Saturday in an attempt to retain their advantage. Englands cause was helped further when Marcus Trescothick said on Friday he hoped to be able to bat despite fracturing his right index finger.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

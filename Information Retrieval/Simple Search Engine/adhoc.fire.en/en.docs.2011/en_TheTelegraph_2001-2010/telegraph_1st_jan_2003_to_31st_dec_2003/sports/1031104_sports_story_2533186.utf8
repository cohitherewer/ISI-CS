 Three rookies in Bangla squad
Dhaka: Bangladeshs national cricket selectors on Monday included three uncapped players in a 13-member squad for a three-match one-day International series against England beginning later this week. Allrounder Khaled Mahmud will lead the team while the selectors made three changes from the Test squad that lost 0-2 to England this past weekend, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said. The selectors replaced experienced  but recently off-colour  opening batsman Javed Omar with newcomer Nafis Iqbal, while another fresh face, off-spinner Jamaluddin, was taken in place of left-arm spinner Enam-ul Haque, who managed only two wickets on his debut in the second Test against England. Top-order batsman Moniruzzaman, who remained uncapped after failing to make the starting line-up in the second Test, was also included. THE SQUAD Khaled Mahmud (captain), Habibul Bashar, Khaled Mashud (wicketkeeper), Hannan Sarkar, Rajin Saleh, Alok Kapali, Mushfiq-ur Rahman, Mohammad Rafique, Tapash Baisya, Moniruzzaman, Anwar Hossain Monir, Nafis Iqbal and Jamaluddin.

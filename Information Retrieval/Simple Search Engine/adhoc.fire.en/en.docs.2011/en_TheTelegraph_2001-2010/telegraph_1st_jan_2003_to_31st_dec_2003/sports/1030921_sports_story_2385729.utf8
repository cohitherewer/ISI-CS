The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Players real challenge, not wickets, says Ross
Chennai, Sept. 20 (PTI): Having devised innovative training methods to counter Indian conditions during the upcoming Test series, New Zealands stand-in coach Ashley Ross on Saturday said the real challenge for his team will be the Indian players and not the wickets we play on. We are not concerned about the kind of wickets we are playing on... Whether they are spinning wickets or grassy wickets, the challenge will be Indian players, not the wicket we play on, Ross said here today. Ross, who came to India ahead of the national team to watch the Irani Cup tie between Mumbai and Rest of India, said: Its always a great challenge playing international cricket in India. We have to see whether the plans we made when India came over are still valid. Otherwise we will have to change and keep improving, he said. All Indians are great players... We have prepared hard because we believe its one of the great challenges, the coach said. The Black Caps arrive in India tomorrow night for a two-Test series and a tri-series featuring world champions Australia as the third team. The fear is of the unknown. A lot of our preparation has been geared towards diminishing the unknown. If you know yourself and the enemy then you need not fear a thousand battles, he said. Ahead of the tour, the cricketers played on wickets that were specifically prepared to mirror Indian conditions and in the heat as well which could help us a lot, Ross added.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Work on a theme: Gordon
  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Sourav: Sandy is very very good Paarl: On the eve of Indias World Cup 2003 campaign, top sport psychologist Sandy Gordon has advised Sourav Ganguly and Co. to decide on a theme for the tournament and work towards that. Gordon, who interacted with the Indians both collectively and individually (last eveni- ng and this morning), told The Telegraph: The Australians had No Regrets as their 1999 theme... Similarly, Ive asked your boys to quickly get one in place for this edition... It made a difference then, it could do so this time as well. An important member of Steve Waughs Support Team during the last World Cup, Gordon added: Basically, I tell both players and coaches to take their job seriously, without taking themselves too seriously. Have fun is something I keep repeating. However, Gordon (a senior lecturer at the University of Western Australia, in Perth) declined to comment on the degree of the Indians mental toughness. Its impossible to make an assessment so very soon... Obviously, each one of them is very talented. Gordon, who has been around in these parts on an invitation from a couple of organisat- ions, informed he wont be available in person should any of the Indians wish to interact with him as the tournament progresses. Because of my commitments at the university, thats not possible. But, yes, they will be free to either call me or relate via e-mail, Gordon, whose contract with the Australian Cricket Board ended in September 2001, pointed out. Perhaps, the Board of Control for Cricket in India should look at a long-term arrangement. The players, of course, have already been impressed. Sandys very, very good, is how the captain summed up the mood. Incidentally, each one of them has been asked to list goa- ls for the World Cup. Indias opening match, against ICC Trophy champions Holland, is on Wednesday.  Copyright

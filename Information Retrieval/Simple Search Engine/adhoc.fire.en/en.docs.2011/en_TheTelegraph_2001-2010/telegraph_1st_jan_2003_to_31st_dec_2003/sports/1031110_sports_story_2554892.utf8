 PCB wants duo to show maturity 
Karachi: Pakistans cricket officials have called on coach Javed Miandad and chief selector Aamer Sohail to show more maturity after a series of rows between the two of them. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Tauqir Zia is to hold a meeting to try and mend fences after the latest spat broke out before the teams series against New Zealand. He will meet with both and try to resolve this issue over selection matters, Pakistan Cricket board (PCB) chief executive Rameez Raja said on Sunday. It is a case of communication breakdown between the two and I think we need a more mature approach from them. Miandad and Sohail exchanged words after the selectors announced a pool of players for this months series without consulting captain Inzamam-ul Haq or Miandad. We try to discuss things with them as much as possible. But we dont need to talk to them every time we select, Sohail said. Two other members of the selection committee, Saleem Yousuf and Shoaib Muhammad, have also complained that Sohail didnt wait for their approval before publishing the squad. Miandad and Sohail were also involved in a public spat during the October series against South Africa, when the chief selector took a swipe at Miandads coaching methods. Miandad told Sohail to mind his own business.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Crunch tie for East Bengal today
 Much depends on Bhaichungs form Mumbai: Defending champions East Bengal would look to end the year 2003 on a victorious note Wednesday when they take on local giants Mahindra United at the Cooperage in the seventh round of the eighth National Football League. The Calcutta giants have not had a very good outing in the NFL this season and would like to go into the New Year on a winning note. But East Bengal, who lost to table leaders Dempo 2-3 in their last league encounter, would have their task cut out as they face a confident Mahindra outfit. Mahindra comfortably defeated lowly placed Indian Bank 2-0 and are one place above their opponents in the table with 12 points from six matches. East Bengal have eight points from as many outings. East Bengal will be hoping that their mercurial striker Bhaichung Bhutia would fire on all cylinders with Christiano Junior, Debjit Ghosh and Bijen Singh, who had a good match against Dempo, giving him the necessary support. As for the local outfit, they would have seasoned Kalyan Chowbey under the bar with Sanjay Parte, Arun Malhotra and Covan Lawrence manning the defence. Mahindra coach David Booth will also hope that his young forwards  Venkatesh and Abhishek Yadav  would lift their game against the ASEAN Cup champions to keep the teams momentum going.

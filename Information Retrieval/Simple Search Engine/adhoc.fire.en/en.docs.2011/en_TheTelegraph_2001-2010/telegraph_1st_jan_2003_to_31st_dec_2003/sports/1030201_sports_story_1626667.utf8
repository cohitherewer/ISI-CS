The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deportivo up despite loss
 Madrid: Kings Cup holders Deportivo Coruna squeezed through to the semi-finals on the away goals rule after going down 3-4 to second division leaders Murcia in an extraordinary quarter-final second leg clash Thursday. Deportivo, leading 1-0 from the first leg at Riazor, looked to have settled the tie by the half-hour mark as Diego Tristan struck twice to give them a three-goal advantage. David Karanka gave the home side hope by getting one back on 35 minutes and Deportivo were close to succumbing to a fightback at the start of the second half. Juanma reduced the deficit with a far-post header and Murcia moved 3-2 ahead on the night just five minutes later when Joan Capdevila handled in the area and Tito fired in the resulting penalty. Manuel Pablo brought Deportivo back to 3-3 with a right-footed volley on 58 minutes but Javier Iruretas side was still unable to settle. Juanmi twice made good saves from Murcia counter-attacks before Miguel Albiol got in ahead of the defence to head home Titos right-wing free-kick at the near post in the 84th minute. Deportivo will join Real Mallorca, Osasuna and Recreativo Huelva in the draw for the semi-finals. (Reuters)  Copyright

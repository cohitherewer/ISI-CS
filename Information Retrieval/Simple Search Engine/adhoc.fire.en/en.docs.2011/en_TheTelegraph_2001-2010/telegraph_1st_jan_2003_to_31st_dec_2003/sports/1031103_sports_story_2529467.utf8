The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, November 03, 2003  Nov. 5 start postponed 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: The Royal Calcutta Turf Club (RCTC) stewards have decided to postpone the season opener on November 5, according to an RCTC press release on Sunday. However, the entries already closed for that day will stand.				 										With winter track still soft following heavy rain early last week and also because of regular showers last month,.trainers reluctance to race on the monsoon track, it is understood, has prompted the stewards to take the stand. 				 										The season may, however, get started by the weekend. The ongoing feud involving owners and trainers against the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC), is learnt to be snowballing into a major issue, and has left RCTC in a state of indecision pertaining to fixing a fresh date immediately. BTC may postpone its scheduled start of the winter season on November 8. Therefore, RCTC will happily opt to race on Saturday or Sunday. Otherwise, hoof beats will definitely be heard at the RCTC ground from Friday.

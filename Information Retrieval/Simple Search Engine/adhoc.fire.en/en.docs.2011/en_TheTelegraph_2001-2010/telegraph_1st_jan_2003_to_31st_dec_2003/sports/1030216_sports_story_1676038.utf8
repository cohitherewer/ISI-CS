 Arsenal send United packing
Manchester: Arsenal struck a double blow in their bid for honours by knocking arch-rivals Manchester United out of the FA Cup in the fifth round with an emphatic 2-0 victory Saturday. The match had been billed as a defining moment in the chase for Premier League title by Alex Ferguson before kick-off, who said the 1999 FA Cup semi-final defeat of Arsenal was the springboard for Uniteds treble. The win at Old Trafford is sure to give the holders and current League leaders a psychological boost as they attempt to beat second-placed United to the title as well as reach the FA Cup final for the third successive season. Goals in each half from Edu and Sylvain Wiltord ensured United failed to progress to the quarter finals for the first time since 1999 and also earned quick revenge for their 0-2 League defeat in December. But Arsenals victory will also be long remembered for an astonishing miss by Ryan Giggs who chipped over with the goal at his mercy just before Edus goal from a deflected free-kick. The opening stages contained some fiery tackles with Paul Scholes booked in the third minute for two crunching fouls on Patrick Vieira.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

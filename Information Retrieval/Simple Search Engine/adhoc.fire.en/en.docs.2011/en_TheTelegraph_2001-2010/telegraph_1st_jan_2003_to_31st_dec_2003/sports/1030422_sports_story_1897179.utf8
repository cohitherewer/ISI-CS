 Rameez set to be PCB director
Islamabad: Former captain Rameez Raja is all set to replace Chishty Mujahid as PCB director later this week. According to reports, Raja was considered for the post by PCB chairman Lt General Tauqir Zia, who has decided to bring about changes in the board to convert it into a lean, mean outfit capable of proactively taking up the challenges at the domestic and international level. Though Mujahid has been offered a graceful exit, on the pretext of family problems demanding his time, it is indeed a sacking. Among others, he is charged with being mostly absent from the PCB headquarters. In his about 10 months in office, Mujahid has mostly been away from the Gaddafi Stadium for long spells. During the entire duration of the World Cup, he travelled across southern Africa on commentary assignments. Raja is currently the chairman of the PCBs development committee. (PTI)  Copyright

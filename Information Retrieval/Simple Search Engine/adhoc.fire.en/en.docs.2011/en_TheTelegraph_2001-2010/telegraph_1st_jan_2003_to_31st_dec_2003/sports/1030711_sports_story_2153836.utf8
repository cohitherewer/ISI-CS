Pictures by Kishor Roychowdhury				 										Calcutta: Lockers Park, the lesser-fancied Bharath Singh-trainee, recorded an easy victory in the Gamble For Love Cup on Thursday. S. Rabani partnered the six-year-old gelding by Batzushka out of Fusion. 				 										The Almanac Cup, the sporting event in the afternoons race-card, was also claimed by an outsider, Kainat, thanks to jockey Md Amils amateurish riding tactics on the half-money favourite, Brighter Future. Amil was seen slipping into a long lead from the start and also unnecessarily cutting pace with Common Spirit. As a result, the favourite was left with no energy to pull on nearing the final turn. Kainat was trained by Javed Khan.RESULTS				 										1. Desiree Handicap 1,200m: (3-5-4-2) Timbavati (E. Smith) 1; Idolize (Shanker) 2; Bigshow (Merchant) 3; Royal Command (R. Ahmed) 4.

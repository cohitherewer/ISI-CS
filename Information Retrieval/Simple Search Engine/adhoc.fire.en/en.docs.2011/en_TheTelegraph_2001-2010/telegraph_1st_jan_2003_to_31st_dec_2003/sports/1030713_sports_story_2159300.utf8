The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, July 13, 2003  Grosvenor Square has edge over Fond Fantasy 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Bangalore, July 12: Eleven horses will face the starter for the rich 2,000m Kingfisher Derby Bangalore, the blue riband of the season and the main attraction tomorrow, here. But on paper it looks to be a straight fight between Grosvenor Square and Fond Fantasy. Both are unbeaten horses till date and also winners of the Colts Trial and the Fillies Stakes, respectively. 				 										Further, the two champions have never been extended during their triumphs against the best of their age. It may turn out to be an interesting tussle. However, going by their style of victory and also the timings while winning classics, the one who looks to hold a slight advantage is the Darius Byramji-ward Grosvenor Square to be partnered by a very confident David Badel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hockey idea doesnt enthuse PM 
New Delhi: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Thursday did not appear to be in favour of immediate resumption of sporting links between India and Pakistan till a conducive atmosphere was created. Replying to a short special discussion in the Lok Sabha on Indo-Pak relations, he referred to his Pakistani counterpart Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamalis suggestion for a hockey match between the two countries and explained how it was not possible in the current situation. You are a good hockey player. But, one thing I cannot understand is that when a hockey match between India and Pakistan is on, news comes that terrorists have carried out an attack in Jammu and Kashmir and killed 50 innocent persons including women and children. Will this help in arousing a feeling of friendship? Vajpayee wondered. The last India-Pakistan Test series took place in India in 1999. It ended 1-1 and the following Asian Test Championship tie was won by Pakistan. (PTI)  Copyright

 Steve lauds Lara century
 - I dont mind Brian getting a hundred if were going to win, says Aussie skipper  Brad Hogg, Brett Lee and Adam Glichrist celebrate the fall of a West Indian wicket Wednesday (AFP) Port-of-Spain: West Indies captain Brian Lara scored his first home Test century on Wednesday after ten years of trying but was not in the mood to celebrate after his team crashed to a 118-run defeat. Im happy to get a 100 but in the situation I was supposed to get more to save the West Indies and that did not happen, said Lara, who went on to make 122 but could not stop his side going 2-0 down in the four-Test series. Lara proved again that he is still among the worlds best as he took on first Jason Gillespie and then Brett Lee in a battle which proved one of the high spots of the series. Although the 33-year-old left-hander was reluctant to blow his own trumpet, Australia captain Steve Waugh expressed his admiration for a player who has now hit 20 Test centuries. It was a great hundred. I dont think Ive ever seen him hit a bad hundred and hes a great player, said Waugh. It was a great battle, great Test match cricket to watch  a quick bowler bowling as fast as he can against a world class batsman. It was tremendous Test match cricket but I dont mind Brian getting 100 if were going to win. The West Indies were set 407 to win after Waugh made what many considered a generous declaration on Tuesday with his team at 238 for three. The hosts were all out for 288 but gave Australia a minor scare by reaching 210 for three at lunch. Waugh said he never doubted he had made the right decision. I play for us to win, Im not interested in putting them out of the game he said. I wanted as many overs as possible for us to win the Test match. I didnt see any point in batting on for the sake of it, I was just interested in giving us time to take wickets.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Windies131/4 after 30 overs
Castries: Andrew Symonds and Michael Clarke smashed 75 runs each to guide Australia to 258 for four off 50 overs in the third one-day International against the West Indies on Wednesday. West Indies had reached 131/4 after 30 overs. Marlon Samuels (23) and Wavell Hinds (33) were at the crease. Earlier, Chris Gayle hit 43. The pair produced a 99-run partnership to shore up the Australian innings, which was starting to look vulnerable at 79 for three. Pace bowlers Mervyn Dillon and Corey Collymore put the Australian batters under early pressure after West Indies captain Brian Lara put the tourists in to bat. Dillon was rewarded for a good opening spell when Matthew Hayden was caught behind for 20. Jimmy Maher, who had a reverse sweep from off-spinner Omari Banks dropped by Wavell Hinds at short third man, was then caught for 17 just two balls later by Devon Smith at long-leg to leave the visitors 48 for two in the 10th over. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting attacked the West Indies bowlers from the outset but when he was run out for 32 by Collymore, the visitors were 79 for three in the 17th over. Symonds and Clarke, in only his second one-day International, then regained the initiative as they boosted the run rate further with aggressive running. Symonds was also particularly brutal against the wayward bowling of part-timers Wavell Hinds and Marlon Samuels, smashing a series of boundaries.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

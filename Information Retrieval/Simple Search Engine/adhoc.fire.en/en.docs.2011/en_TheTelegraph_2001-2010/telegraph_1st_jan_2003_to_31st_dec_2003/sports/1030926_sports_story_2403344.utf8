 Inzamam takes over
 Inzamam Islamabad: Inzamam-ul Haq will lead Pakistan in next months home series against South Africa, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Thursday. Inzamam replaces Rashid Latif, who resigned as captain on Wednesday citing personal reasons. Latifs resignation was accepted in a meeting on Thursday. PCB chairman Tauqir Zia chaired the meeting which was attended by PCB chief executive Rameez Raja, chief selector Aamer Sohail, coach Javed Miandad and Inzamam. It has been a difficult decision to accept Latifs resignation because of his wonderful contributions to the young Pakistan team after the World Cup, Zia said in a statement. But I guess life has to go on and Latif will continue to make useful contributions in the days to come. Latif was included in the 16-man squad to take on South Africa in the five-match ODI series starting in Lahore on October 3. The Test squad will be announced later. The PCB has complete faith and trust in Inzamams abilities and we wish him all the best, Zia said. Inzamam said: I am delighted that the establishment has shown faith in me. I will try to carry on the good work done by Latif, he said. There will be pressure on me. But I guess after playing for so many years, one has to raise his hand and say yes I can handle this pressure and shoulder the hopes of Pakistan supporters.

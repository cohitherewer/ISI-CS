The Telegraph - Calcutta
 City leg on Jan. 10-11
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Calcutta leg of the fourth JK Tyre national karting championship will be held on January 10 and 11 at the Monte Carlo track in Clown Town. This will be the fifth leg of the national championship. The championship this year will be in three categories, with a new exhibition category (the midget class, with matching-size karts). The cadet class (8 to 12 years), introduced last year, becomes a championship class this year. That apart, the senior and junior classes remain, only having grown hugely competitive in this event, presented by Corsa-SAIL and co-sponsored by Tourism Malaysia and Speed of Bharat Petroleum. Sanjay Sharma, head of motorsports in JK Tyre, said that apart from the Rs 10 lakh prize purse, another big prize for the national winner this year will be an Opel Corsa-SAIL car. The other bonanza this year will be in the form of a trip, with all winners from the regional rounds in the senior category getting a round trip to Malaysia, courtesy Tourism Malaysia. The karts to be used here are Formula India CK3 and FIK3 for cadet and for seniors, respectively. They are 8 and 12 bhp karts, in that order. Sharma said the idea is to slowly get the kids out of the four-stroke karts and move them into the realm of two-stroke 40bhp powerful Rotax karts that is the order of the day. Armaan Ebrahim, the 14-year-old who will be the first Indian to take part in the world junior Rotax finals to be held in Cairo on January 24, has had a feel of the engines and chassis while qualifying in this junior class and he remains cautious of predicting anything in the finals. Ace racer Karun Chandhok said being a product of the system and structure put in place in this national karting championship, he was sure the system is working. Incidentally, two of the winners in the recent racing championship in Chennai had graduated from the karting circuit. The 400m Clown Town track isnt good for Rotax karts, but will be sufficient challenge for the current version of the karts in use. The races go over to Bangalore and New Delhi from here before culminating in the finals.  Copyright

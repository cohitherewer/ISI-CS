 Azhar: Im a BCCI scapegoat
Hyderabad: Former national captain Mohammed Azharuddin Friday said the report of K. Madhavan (the one-man inquiry committee into the match-fixing scandal) was inconsistent and a bundle of contradictions. Azharuddin said the BCCI had made him a scapegoat in the scandal by slapping a life ban on him. Continuing the arguments in the court of second additional chief judge, Azharuddins counsel P. Jagdish said Madhavan had approached the issue more with an intention to fix the former captain rather than finding out the truth. The counsel told the court, which is hearing Azharuddins petition seeking quashing of the life ban on him, that though the charges were made against Azharuddin, no specific charge memo was served on him so that he could lead evidence that he is clean in the issue. The BCCI found Azharuddin as a helpless scapegoat and hence made him the victim, the counsel argued.  (PTI)  Copyright

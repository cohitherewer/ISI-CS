The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Old battle, new ring
- Aussies go in without Symonds against Sri Lanka Ricky Ponting stretches during training at the Wanderers in Johannesburg Thursday. (AFP) Johannesburg: Australia and Sri Lanka go through their paces at Centurion, smiling at the right people and saying the right things. But there is bad blood in the air on the eve of Fridays opening Super Six clash. The two teams have not seen eye to eye for years.Perhaps some personal friendships have stretched across the divide between the two camps  the players meet up often enough, after all.For the most part, though, the distrust and animosity stem from one mans elbow joint.Muttiah Muralidharan will probably end his career as the most successful and the most controversial bowler to have ever lived, all because of that right elbow. When he was first called for throwing while touring Australia in 1995-96, it created an international furore. Again, in 1998-99 he was called and Arjuna Ranatunga led his side off in protest.Muralis action is as unique as it is bizarre. His rotating wrist, as well as an arm, which cannot fully straighten, adds to the visual confusion. Australia, too, appear convinced that Sri Lankas most successful bowler breaks the laws of the game with every delivery and they are not afraid to say that.			Leg-spinner Shane Warne  out of the World Cup after breaking another fundamental law of the game by testing positive for a banned drug  did not go quite as far as that in May last year but he certainly kept the pot bubbling.I think his action will always create speculation with people, Joe Public, just saying does he or doesnt he?Some exchanges, though, have not led to public contrition. Just before the start of the 1999 World Cup, Warne wrote of Ranatunga in a newspaper column that Sri Lanka, and the game overall, would be better off without him. I dont like him, and Im not in a club of one.Ranatunga responded: I come from a 2,500-year-old culture. You all know where they come from.Harvey for SymondsAllrounder Andrew Symonds has been forced to pull out of Fridays match after sustaining a groin strain. He has been replaced by Ian Harvey, who took seven wickets against Pakistan and Holland, in the first round.Symonds has strained a muscle, captain Ricky Ponting said. It happened at training and he didnt pull up that well. So Harvey comes in for him.TEAMSAustralia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Bevan, Ian Harvey, Brad Hogg, Brett Lee, Andy Bichel, Glenn McGrath.Sri Lanka (from): Sanath Jayasuriya (captain), Maravan Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Aravinda de Silva, Russel Arnold, Jehan Mubarak, Avishka Gunawardena, Hashan Tillekeratne, Muttiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas, Dilhara Fernando, Pulasthi Gunaratne, Prabath Nissanka, Charitha Buddhika.

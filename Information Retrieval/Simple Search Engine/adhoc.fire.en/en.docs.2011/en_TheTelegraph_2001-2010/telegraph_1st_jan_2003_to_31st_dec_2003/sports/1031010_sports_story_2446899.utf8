 Montoya laments unfair rulings 
 FIA needs to change its attitude, says Montoya Suzuka: Juan Pablo Montoya claims unfair rulings ended his world championship hopes this season. Montoya was challenging Michael Schumacher closely for the title as they headed to the last race in the United States and their battle was expected to go down to the wire in Suzuka this weekend. But the Colombian was left seething after being handed what he claims was an unfair drive-through penalty at Indianapolis for a collision with Schumachers Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello. He believes the sport needs permanent stewards to prevent a similar situation happening again. I still believe the decision was unfair, he said Thursday. It was a racing incident. The biggest problem we have got is that every race you have got different stewards. I think it is sad to see that such a big series is still messing around with different stewards every race. You cant go against the FIA. They are making the rules and its like: you like it, you race, you dont like it, go race somewhere else. All you need is more consistency. The rules are there and you have got to know what is right and what is wrong. You have got to have someone who goes to every race and they know what is right or wrong. Montoya believes Schumachers tangle with Fernando Alonso at the British Grand Prix in July is proof that stewards decisions are inconsistent. He claimed the Ferrari driver barged Renault driver Alonso off the track at at Silverstone and was lucky to escape any punishment. What Michael did to Alonso at Silverstone, if you really look at that that was a very unfair thing to do, he said. He knew that he was going to pass and he knew the only way to stop him was pushing the other guy off. I think that deserves a much bigger penalty than what happened with Rubens. Montoyas penalty effectively ended his championship hopes as it combined with a fuel rig problem and a brief off-track excursion to leave him sixth and out of the title race. (AFP)  Copyright

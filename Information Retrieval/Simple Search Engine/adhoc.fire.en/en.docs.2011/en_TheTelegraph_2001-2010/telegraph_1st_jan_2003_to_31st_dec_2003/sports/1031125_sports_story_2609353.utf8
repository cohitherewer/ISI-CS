				 																																	London: Police investigating a fatal road crash on Sunday have arrested West Bromwich Albion player Lee Hughes. A 56-year-old man was killed when a Renault Megane in which he was a rear seat passenger was hit by a silver Mercedes coupe in Coventry. The 27-year-old Hughes, who is alleged to have left the scene, presented himself to a Coventry police station on Monday when he was detained for questioning. 				 																																	Douglas Graham died from his injuries. Three other passengers in the car were also injured, including the wife of the dead man, who broke a leg. 				 																																	The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 10 years in jail. Failing to stop after an accident carries a maximum penalty of six months in custody. 				 																																	Chiba (Japan): The all-conquering womens world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe suffered the rare indignity of being overtaken as her English team finished a distant sixth behind Ethiopia in a road relay race in Japan on Monday. 				 																																	Radcliffe, the holder of the worlds fastest marathon time of 2:15:25, led in the 10-kilometre first section of the six-woman relay race, but Ethiopian and Kenyan runners overtook her shortly before the 8km mark. Ethiopias Berhane Adere clocked 30:12 and Kenyas Lucy Wangui 30:18 in the first section ahead of Radcliffe who finished third. England eventually finished sixth in 2:19:12, far behind Ethiopia in 2:11:22 and runners-up Kenya in 2:15:37. Japan took third place in 2:15:40. 				 																																	Leverkusen: Bayer Leverkusens Croatian international Marko Babic has extended his contract at the BayArena until 2007. The 22-year-old midfielder was contracted until 2004 but has arrested fears that he would seek pastures new by signing on the dotted line for a further three years. 				 																																	There is a lot of trust and honesty at Bayer, declared Babic. For me that is worth more than money. 				 																																	Babic, who arrived at the club in January 2000, has been a key figure in helping Leverkusen to third spot in the Bundesliga this season. He scored the equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. 				 																																	London: Former Middlesbrough coach and England captain Bryan Robson has been appointed boss of Bradford City, the struggling first division club said on Monday.				 																																	Robson will replace Nicky Law, who was sacked two weeks ago after a miserable run of home form that brought six losses and only five points, with fans staying away in droves.				 																																	Robson, tipped recently to take over the coaching of Nigerias national team until the deal fell through over a wages dispute, has been out of management since leaving Middlesbrough in 2001. 				 																																	Dubai: Abdulrahmin Juma scored twice as the United Arab Emirates beat 10-man Sri Lanka 3-0 to book their place in the 2004 Asian Cup finals.				 																																	Juma struck first on the stroke of half-time when he headed home a cross from Mohammed Srour. 				 																																	Sri Lanka were reduced to 10 men in the 67th minute when Mohamed Ezimir was shown the red card for a foul on Fahad Ali.				 																																	Juma scored his second 11 minutes from time before Mohammed Omar completed the scoring in the 87th minute. 				 																																	Santiago: Rioting fans forced the Chilean championship match between Universidad Catolica and Wanderers to be suspended with three minutes to play, the football league said on Monday.

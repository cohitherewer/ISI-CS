																								London: Chelsea have sacked their Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich after he tested positive for cocaine.																								Chelsea FC can confirm that notice has been served on goalkeeper Mark Bosnich that his contract is being terminated under the terms of the FA Premier League, the Premier League Club said in a statement on Tuesday.																								The English Football Association charged Bosnich with bringing the game into disrepute on December 27. Bosnich, who turns 31 next Monday, is suspended from all soccer activities until his case is heard by the FA.																								Bosnich joined Chelsea on a free transfer from Manchester United two years ago but has not played for the London club since November 2001 and has made only seven appearances for them.																								In November he was diagnosed with severe depression and admitted to a clinic for treatment.																								Bosnich had been the subject of intense media speculation that he had failed a drugs test before the FA confirmed the allegations two weeks ago.																								If the FAs charges are upheld Bosnich could face a worldwide ban of up to a year. (REUTERS)

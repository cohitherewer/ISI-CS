The Telegraph - Calcutta
 First day washed off
 Lou Vincent keeps himself occupied on the rain-marred first day of the second Test against Sri Lanka in Kandy Saturday. (AFP) Kandy, May 3 (Agencies): The opening days play in the second and final Test between Sri Lanka and New Zealand was called off without a ball being bowled Saturday due to a slushy outfield at the rain-ravaged Asgiriya stadium. Umpires Daryl Harper and Simon Taufel, both from Australia, had one look at the conditions an hour before the toss to abandon play for the day. It does not look good at all, Harper said. Lets hope for the best tomorrow. He also said, We are dealing with international cricket here and we couldnt even contemplate playing club cricket on this. Inclement weather over this popular hill resort for the past week and the forecast of heavy rain ahead has threatened to make the decisive Test a non-starter.  Copyright

 Mukesh Kumar ignored again
New Delhi: The Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) on Sunday retained the same squad that triumphed in the recent Hamburg Masters tournament for the prestigious Champions Trophy in The Netherlands in August. Five or six additional players would be named to take part in the conditioning camp as back-ups in case of injury to any regular team member. Six top hockey-playing nations would be seen in action in the Champions Trophy from August 16 to 24 in Amstelveen. India have never won the tournament and finished fourth in the last edition at Cologne, Germany.

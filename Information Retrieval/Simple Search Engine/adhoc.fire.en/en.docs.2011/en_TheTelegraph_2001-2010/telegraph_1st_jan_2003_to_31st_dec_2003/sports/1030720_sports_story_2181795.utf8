 Steve catches up with Sachin
 First test - Bangladesh battle to avoid innings defeat Steve Waugh pulls one to the fence en route to his unbeaten 100 in Darwin on Saturday, Day II of the first Test against Bangladesh. (AFP) Darwin, July 19 (AFP): Steve Waugh reached another landmark with a blazing century as Australia tightened the noose around Bangladesh on Day II of the first Test on Saturday.The 38-year-old scampered for two runs to raise his 100 and promptly declared the first innings closed at 407 for seven. That left Bangladesh with the daunting task of having to score 311 to avoid yet another innings defeat. They were 70 for one at close.Waugh joined Sachin Tendulkar on 31 Test centuries, second only to Sunil Gavaskar, and became only the second man to score centuries against nine Test-playing nations. He emulated South Africas Gary Kirsten.  Records appear to keep tumbling for Waugh, who is playing his 50th Test as skipper and needs just one more win to better Clive Lloyds 36 wins as the most successful Test skipper.Waughs knock came off 133 balls and included ten fours and a six. His latest show-stopper trumped Darren Lehmanns second Test hundred  110 off 223 balls with ten boundaries and a six  earlier in the day.Nineteen-year-old Mortaza was the pick of the Bangla bowlers with three for 74 off 23 overs.The Australians dismissed Bangladesh for 97 Friday in just under three hours and off 42.2 overs, but the tourists battled to keep out the formidable attack of Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Lee in the early stages of the second innings.Javed fell in the third over, leg-before to McGrath for five leaving Bangladesh at eight for one, but Sarkar and Bashar batted brightly to see it out to stumps.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI likely to challenge Jadeja award
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Ajay Jadeja, whose troubles may not be over yet New Delhi, April 19: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is likely to challenge arbitrator Justice (retd) J.K. Mehras award in Ajay Jadejas favour.Justice Mehra set aside the five-year (match-fixing related) ban, slapped by the BCCIs disciplinary committee in December 2000, on January 27.The BCCI and Jadeja settled for arbitration, under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996, after the one-time ODI captain moved the Delhi High Court against the disciplinary committees action. If the 90-day period for enforcing/contesting the award is deemed to begin from January 27 itself  and not when all respondents received its copy  then the BCCI has until April 26 to react.While the actual decision will wholly be influenced by the opinion of lawyers (Gopal Subramanium, Harish Salve and Usha Nath Banerjee) who represented the BCCI, many within the set-up strongly feel the award should be challenged, a well-placed source told The Telegraph this evening.Apparently, the Jadeja issue figured prominently during the BCCI office-bearers informal meeting here this month. The office-bearers, of course, had assembled for President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams reception for the World Cup squad.According to the source, the lawyers opinion has probably already been forwarded to the BCCI. Given the whispers, it wont surprise if challenging the award is recommended, the source added.However, if it does come to that, its not clear whether the BCCI must return to the Delhi High Court itself.Significantly, Jadeja isnt the only one waiting for the BCCI to act  for different reasons, as interested are many within Team India. Indeed, quite a few are unlikely to be thrilled if the award goes unchallenged.Its no secret, after all, that some players will prefer sitting out to (again) sharing the dressing room with Jadeja. Perhaps, the BCCI will keep this in mind. Felicitation put offMeanwhile, the World Cup squads felicitation (by the BCCI), slated for April 28, has been put off owing to practical problems. Accordingly, the April 26-27 working committee meeting has also been deferred.Both  Copyright

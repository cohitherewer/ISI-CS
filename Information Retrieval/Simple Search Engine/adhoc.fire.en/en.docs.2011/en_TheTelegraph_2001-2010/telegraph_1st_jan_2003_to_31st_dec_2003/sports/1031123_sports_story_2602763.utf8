The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Now, Sourav says there must be some truth
 Adelaide, Nov. 22 (AFP): Indian captain Sourav  Ganguly said Saturday there must be some basis to allegations  that Abhijit Kale offered bribes to selectors to get picked  for the Indian team.  BCCI ordered an investigation into the allegations  on Friday and suspended Kale as long as the investigations  are on. When I got to know the story yesterday I found it a little hard to believe that somebody would pay so much money just to be a part of the Indian side, Sourav said on the teams arrival here.  Abhijits a consistent performer in first-class cricket,  he has scored loads of runs, so I was a little surprised  when I heard the story. But now I have heard ... That he  has been banned by the BCCI, so there must be some truth  to this story. If it is true its pretty shameful.  Sourav said he had no first-hand knowledge about the  incident and had only heard about it in the media.  John Wright said he doubted the controversy would  affect their performance in Australia. That story has developed  since we left the country and it will run its course.  Copyright

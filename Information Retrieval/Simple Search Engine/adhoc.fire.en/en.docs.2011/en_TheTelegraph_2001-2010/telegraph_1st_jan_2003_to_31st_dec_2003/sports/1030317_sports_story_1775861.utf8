 Clubs demand more power 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The top NFL clubs have appealed to the AIFF not to allow players to be approached directly for inter-club transfers. They want the club, on whose payroll the player is, to be approached first. According to sources, clubs lending their weight to the appeal are Mohun Bagan, East Bengal, ITI, Vasco, Tollygunge Agragami, JCT, Salgaocar, Indian Bank. The clubs also requested the AIFF to give them the option of hosting NFL matches themselves with the federation being paid guarantee money. The clubs proposed they would not play in other meets when the NFL is on.  Copyright

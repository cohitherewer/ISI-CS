 Kambli wants to be back
Mumbai: Vinod Kambli wants to be back playing for India after being cold-shouldered for eight years. The 31-year-old left-hander, who was on Wednesday named in Mumbais list of probables for the new season, said: I want to play again for Mumbai and India. He skipped the domestic season last year, turning out for Boland in South Africa. I wanted the experience of playing on the bouncier pitches of South Africa, Kambli said. Im training hard and have shed a lot of weight and keen to do well. Kambli played the last of his 17 Tests against New Zealand in Cuttack in November, 1995. (AFP)  Copyright

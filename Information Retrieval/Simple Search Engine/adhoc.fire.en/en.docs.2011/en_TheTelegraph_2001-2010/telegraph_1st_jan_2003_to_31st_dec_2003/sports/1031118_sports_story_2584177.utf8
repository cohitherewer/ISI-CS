The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bracken the best in business: Lawson
 - He has got the measure of Sehwag, but Sachin is a different kettle of fish  BY DWAIPAYAN DATTA  Nathan Bracken has matured on this tour, feels coach Lawson Calcutta: He is not directly attached to the Australian team. Geoffrey Francis Lawson will still be very tense when Ricky Pontings men cross swords with Sourav Gangulys team in the tri-series final at the Eden on Tuesday. Nathan Bracken, one of Lawsons most talented students, will be in the line of fire as the Indians go full throttle in their quest for World Cup final revenge. The left-arm seamer has been one of the success stories of this tour and Lawson feels he has it in him to keep the good work going, even in Tuesdays crunch game. The former Aussie tearaway says Bracken has matured a lot during the current tour. He has been under my coaching for the last three years in the New South Wales state team, so I should know. One big addition to his repertoire has been the lethal reverse swinging deliveries, Lawson told The Telegraph. From his young days, Nathan had this ability to swing the new ball. But the reverse swing he has developed of late. We worked for long hours at the net and Im really happy to see my boy doing so well, Lawson added. Not only Bracken, even Brad Williams has been seeking advice from Lawson regularly on this tour. We talked after the Gwalior match, we again exchanged notes after the game in Bangalore, said Lawson who is in India as part of the TV commentary team. What will be his tips for the Aussie spearhead, who faces the unenviable task of keeping the dynamic Sachin Tendulkar-Virender Sehwag duo in check? Sehwag shouldnt be a problem. I feel my student has got the measure of him, Lawson said. Sehwag has been dismissed twice by Bracken for ducks in this tri-series, once caught at slip and the other time leg-before. But Sachin will surely be a different kettle of fish. If the Master Blaster gets set, well But I will tell Nathan not to lose his cool under any circumstance and bowl according to the field, Lawson said. He also felt Bracken has to continue bowling a very tight line and length, which he has done so consistently so far. I am really pleased with the way he has kept the ball in the right area all the time, the 46-year-old observed. Theres another tip for both Bracken and Williams. They must keep the head still so that they never lose sight of the batsman, Lawson suggested. The sessions Bracken had with Bruce Reid, a former Aussie left-arm paceman, were of great help, too. We worked together and Nathan has been reaping the harvests, Lawson remarked. Laswon even went to the extent of stating that Bracken is the best left-arm pace bowler in the world right now. Other than his reverse swing, what makes Nathan deadly is the one that comes in. With Akram retiring, theres hardly anyone who can do that on a consistent basis. Lawson is of the opinion that India are going in with too many left-arm pacers for the Test series Down Under. Nathan provides the right variety to the Aussie attack. But the Indians will lack variety, he said. Coaching offer The senior Aussie coach is likely to train rookies from Punjab and Mumbai in the near future. Lawson revealed that the offer was made to him when he was in Mohali and Mumbai to cover tri-series matches there. Its not yet final. But I would surely love to train Indian bowlers, he said.

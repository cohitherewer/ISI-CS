 Touching gesture from Pak players
 Inzamam says a lot of former Pak cricketers need help Lahore, Sept. 13 (Reuters): The Pakistan team has agreed to donate a percentage of their earnings to a fund for former national players. We have decided that every player in the team will donate five per cent of his earnings from every match for a former player, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said on Saturday. We have also asked the Pakistan board to contribute the same amount that we raise... and they are receptive to the idea. We the players feel that there are lot of former Pakistan cricketers in the country who are in need of financial assistance, Inzamam added. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has a provident fund scheme for its players, but this was launched only a few years ago and many Pakistan internationals who played in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s now face financial difficulties. However the PCB has a contract with the Sharjah-based Cricketers Benefit Fund Series whereby a benefit purse of $35,000 is awarded to a major beneficiary and $105,000 is shared among five minor beneficiaries after every Sharjah meet. The PCB nominates which beneficiaries receive the money.  Copyright

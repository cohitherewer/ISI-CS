 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta, Jan.25: City golfer Simi Mehra scored a hole-in-one at the par-three 159-yard hole on Day Two of the Malaysian Open Ladies Golf Championship in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.																								According to information received here, her feat, if it remains unmatched till the final day, will bag her a Peugeot 307 car, courtesy a local company. Mehra will also be richer by S$5,000.Mehra used a six-iron to achieve the feat.																								It has been a wonderful week for me and scoring the ace probable caps it all, said an overjoyed Smriti. It was just a normal tee-off and I opted for a six-iron since it was an uphill shot and there was headwind.																								This is her first hole-in-one in her professional career though she scored three during her amateur days.																								Smriti tied the knot on Monday with Christopher Guffin and postponed her honeymoon to play in the tournament.																								For the tournament proper, Smriti returned a second day score of one-under-71 and is currently three-under for the tournament.

Exciting youngsters like Ashok Kumar, the boy from Samastipur who finished second last year, Rahil Gangjee, Rahul Ganapathy, Zai Kipgen, Vinod Kumar, Sandeep Syal and Gurbaaz Mann  the longest driving professional in Asia  will also push the top contenders. Like last year, the Tata Open would be the most unique tournament on the Hero Honda Tour, as it would be played over two nine-hole courses.

 Anju returns to warm welcome
New Delhi: Long jump star Anju Bobby George, who created history by becoming the first Indian to win a medal in a world athletic championship in Paris last month-end, returned to a warm welcome here on Monday night. I am very happy, a beaming Anju told fans who thronged the airport to greet the ace athlete. World No. 6 Anju, who won a bronze in Paris, was accompanied by her husband and coach Robert Bobby George as the couple returned to New Delhi after participating in the world athletics final in Monaco on Sunday. After her seasons best performance of 6.70m to emerge on the podium in Paris, the 25-year-old Anju could not repeat that leap in Monaco finishing fifth with a best effort of 6.50m. I went all out on my third jump but fouled it, Anju said about her below par performance. She said she can improve her performance to win another medal in next years Olympics. I only have to make some minor adjustments, Anju said.  (PTI)  Copyright

		 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 Windies set sight on Cup
																								St Johns: The West Indies on Tuesday got down to putting their campaign for next months World Cup in overdrive confident of victory.																								I think the players are in pretty good spirits coming off the tour of Asia where after the first couple of Test matches we certainly rebounded very well. We played some good cricket right until the end to come back and win that one-day series against India, coach Roger Harper said.																								I think it is no mean feat to win anything in India. It isnt easy. And to come back from the defeats of the first two Tests showed remarkable character and spirit by the young players.																								We carried on from there and played good cricket in Bangladesh and I think everyone is in pretty good spirits. Everyone is confident.																								We understand conditions in South Africa will be different. We have to adjust and to adapt to them and do it quickly. But I think we are ready for the challenge.																								Harper said the team had made winning the World Cup their goal. Thats our ultimate objective, he said.																								We have to take it one step at a time. I think that has to be our approach. We go there look to win each match and I think if we do that well give ourselves a very good chance of winning that trophy.																								Captain Carl Hooper and manager Ricky Skerritt shared his feelings. West Indies come up against South Africa, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Kenya and Bangladesh in their group. 																								And they have set out to try and simulate conditions here in their final training sessions at the New Stanford cricket ground in Antigua.																								Former Windies great Andy Roberts was assisting with the coaching of the bowlers and was advising the ground staff on the type of wickets to prepare to get them as close as possible to those in South Africa.																								The pitches in South Africa tend to have a quite a bit of bounce and they have very good carry and there is also a little bit of lateral movement, Harper said. (Reuters)

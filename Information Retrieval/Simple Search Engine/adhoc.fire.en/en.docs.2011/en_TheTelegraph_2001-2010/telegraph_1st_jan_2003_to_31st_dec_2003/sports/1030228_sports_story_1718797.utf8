The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A low-key clash in Bulawayo
Bulawayo: Zimbabwe hope their own trailblazing history doesnt come back to haunt them when they face Holland Friday to keep alive their fading World Cup dream. On Wednesday, Zimbabwes training session was interrupted twice by rain and the unsettled weather could lead to a no result which would be just as demoralising as defeat. Grant Flower has been ruled out as he is still nursing his spinning finger with four stitches after a fielding mishap. Mark Vermeulen will replace him. TEAMS Zimbabwe (from): Heath Streak (capt.), Andy Blignaut, Dion Ebrahim, Sean Ervine, Andy Flower, Travis Friend, Douglas Hondo, Douglas Marillier, Brian Murphy, Henry Olonga, Tatenda Taibu, Mark Vermeulen, Guy Whittall, Craig Wishart. Holland (from): Roland Lefebvre (capt.), Luuk van Troost, Daan van Bung, Jacob Esmeijer, Victor Grandia, Feiko Kloppenburg, Tim de Leede, Henk Mol, Klaus van Noortwijk, Adeel Raja, Edgar Schiferli, Reinhout Scholte, Jeroen Smits, Nick Statham, Bas Zuiderent. Umpires: Steve Bucknor (WI) and Tyron Wijewardene (Sri). Third umpire: Nadeen Ghouri (Pak). Match Referee: Clive Lloyd (WI).  (AFP)  Copyright

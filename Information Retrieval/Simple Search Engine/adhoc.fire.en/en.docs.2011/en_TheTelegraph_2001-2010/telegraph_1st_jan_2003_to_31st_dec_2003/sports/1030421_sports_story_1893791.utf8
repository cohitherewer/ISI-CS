 Marauding Aussies push WI on backfoot 
  Ricky Ponting after his century in Port-of-Spain Saturday Port-of-Spain: Vice-captain Ricky Ponting thumped his first Test double century and Adam Gilchrist weighed in with an unbeaten hundred to put Australia firmly in control of the second Test against the West Indies on Sunday.Australia declared on 576 for four shortly before tea on the second day with Ponting making 206. The West Indies were quickly in trouble in their first innings, losing two wickets for 25 runs before the second interval. Devon Smith went for a duck when he got an edge to a Jason Gillespie delivery and was caught behind by Gilchrist.Wavell Hinds was then sent back the last ball before the interval, having made 20, when he edged Brett Lee to Matthew Hayden at first slip.Ponting, in outstanding form after scoring 140 in the World Cup final last month and a hundred in the first Test in Guyana, reached his landmark by taking two runs off Vasbert Drakes in the third over after lunch.The West Indies were 116 for two at 2 am. Brian Lara on 48 and Daren Ganga on 44 were at the crease.Ponting, whose previous best was 197 against Pakistan in Perth in 1999, had been at the crease for 476 minutes, faced 344 balls, hit 23 fours and one six before reaching his 200.He was finally out for 206 when he was stumped by Carlton Baugh off Marlon Samuels.Gilchrist reached his hundred, the eighth of his 41-match Test career, after driving Mervyn Dillon through the offside for two runs, having lofted him for six through the onside earlier in the same over.Gilchrist faced 105 balls and hit eleven fours and two sixes.Yesterday, Ponting and Darren Lehmann plundered a limp West Indian bowling attack in a record stand. Lehmann was out for 160 four overs before the close, giving debutante wicketkeeper Carlton Baugh his first Test dismissal. Lehmann and Pontings record stand eclipsed the Australian record for the third wicket of 295 between Colin McDonald and Neil Harvey against the West Indies in Kingston in 1955. (REUTERS)  Copyright

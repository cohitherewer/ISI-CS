The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roddick the new world No. 1
 Gustavo Kuerten, who beat Mark Philippoussis in Paris on Wednesday Paris: American Andy Roddick took over as world No. 1 on Thursday after reaching the quarter finals of the Paris Masters. The US Open champion is the 22nd player to top the rankings since they were introduced in 1973 and the sixth American-born player after Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Jim Courier, John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors. Roddick beat Spains Tommy Robredo 6-3, 6-4 in the last 16 to topple Juan Carlos Ferrero from the top spot. Roddicks elevation to the summit followed Ferreros shock 7-5, 7-5 defeat by Czech Jiri Novak earlier on Thursday. The American now leads the Champions Race and will be confirmed as No. 1 in the 12-month Entry System rankings next Monday. Roddicks serve was too much for Robredo, seeded 16th, to handle as the 21-year-olds bullet deliveries repeatedly slammed into the backboards on the centre court in Paris. The second seed kept the pressure on by hurrying through his serves and broke Robredos delivery in the fourth game of the first set and the third of the second. Despite his achievement, Roddick said reaching No. 1 was not as important to him as winning in Paris and Houston. Every match win or lose could be the difference, said Roddick, who will next play Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden.  On Wednesday, Mark Philippoussis was beaten 7-6, 6-7, 6-7 by Gustavo Kuerten in the second round while Sebastien Grosjean bowed out to Tim Henman 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. Roger Federer eased into the last 16 by beating Thierry Ascione 7-6, 6-1. (Agencies)  Copyright

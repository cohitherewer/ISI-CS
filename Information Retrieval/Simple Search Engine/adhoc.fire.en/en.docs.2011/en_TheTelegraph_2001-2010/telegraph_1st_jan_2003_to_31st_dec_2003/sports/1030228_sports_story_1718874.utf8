 Fine for Cairns, McCullum 
Christchurch: New Zealand cricketers Chris Cairns and Brendon McCullum have each been fined NZ $500 following a brawl at a Durban nightclub last week, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said on Thursday. Cairns was assaulted as he left the nightclub and was knocked to the ground, but was not seriously hurt. NZC said in a statement on its website that chief executive Martin Snedden had investigated the incident. Behaviour exhibited by some of the players at the Tiger Tiger nightclub on the evening in question was unacceptable and should not be allowed either by the players or team management to re-occur, NZC said in the statement.

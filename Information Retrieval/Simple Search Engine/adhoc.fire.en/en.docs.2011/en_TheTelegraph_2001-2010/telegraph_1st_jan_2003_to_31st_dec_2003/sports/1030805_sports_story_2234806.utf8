The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Priya on top 
 BY A CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: Top seed Priya Ratnam of Chapra, with a Fide rating of 2064, was forced to split the point for the first time in eight rounds but emerged sole leader in the fourth Jamshedpur edition of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship after Mondays action at the JRD Tata Sports Complex. Priya (7.5 points) was held to a draw by Sourav Anand (Muzaffarpur) in Round 8. Local girls Shalini Srivastava and S. Shruti, who were in the lead jointly with Priya on Sunday, had a disappointing day to slip down the ladder. Shalini was beaten in Round 7 by Ved Prakash (Patna) and drew her Round 8 game with Ashish Kumar (Jamshedpur) for a tally of 6.5 points. Shruti lost both her matches, to Priya and Parag Hunny (Chapra). Seven players trail Priya with seven points apiece, including one player from a tribal school Ramesh Kumar, who accounted for Ankit Kumar. Ramesh has just lost one game  to Shalini in Round 5. Fourth seed and defending champion Manish Sharma lost to unfancied Swet Shyamal (Jamshedpur) in Round 8. Of the six tribal participants from St Thomas High School (Seraikela), one (Rabinson Tudu) has earned five points and three  Sanjai Mormu, Phuluchand Hansa and Raghunath Murmu  have 4.5 points each.

 Mauresmo tames Myskina
Philadelphia: Amelie Mauresmo turned the tables on Anastasia Myskina and ended a title drought of more than five months at the Advanta Championships on Sunday. Mauresmo rallied to beat Myskina 5-7, 6-0, 6-2 in the final of the $585,000 indoor event. You beat me last time in Moscow, and now its my turn here in Philly, Mauresmo told Myskina at the trophy ceremony. The second-seeded Frenchwoman avenged a loss to Myskina in the final of the Kremlin Cup in October. Mauresmo captured her second title of the year in five finals and first since the J and S Cup at Warsaw. She picked up the win when Venus Williams retired in third set of the final. The 24-year-old beat Myskina for the third time in four meetings, notching her tenth career tournament victory. I felt at the beginning that it was tough physically to move well, especially after last night, said Mauresmo, who outlasted Ai Sugiyama, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6) 7-5, in the semi-final. But as the match went on I felt I was moving better. This was the first loss in five finals this year for Myskina, who had triumphed at Doha, Sarasota, Leipzig and Moscow. The 22-year-old Russian earned $49,500. Both Mauresmo and Myskina have qualified for the elite eight-player field for next weeks WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles. (AFP)  Copyright

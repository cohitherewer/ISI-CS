				 																																	Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) officials have yet to decide their stance on next years tour of Zimbabwe.				 																																	With Zimbabwes relationship with Australia at an all-time low because of Australias push for the African nation to remain suspended from the Commonwealth  and Zimbabwes subsequent decision to quit the body  the tour is set to be a hot topic of debate in the new year.				 																																	But CA said they will wait until February before they put the Zimbabwe tour on the agenda amid a tour of Sri Lanka in February and a possible one-day series in Sharjah in April. Australia are scheduled to play two Tests and five one-dayers in Zimbabwe in May and June and CA spokesman Peter Young Monday confirmed the tour would not be discussed until well into 2004.				 																																	The Australian Cricketers Association will also wait until mid-January before they turn their attention to Zimbabwe. 				 																																	London: Jonny Wilkinsons first match since kicking England to World Cup victory last month ended prematurely on Sunday.				 																																	The flyhalf had not played since the tournament in Australia because of a broken bone in his shoulder and he had to go off after 53 minutes of the match between his club side Newcastle and Northampton.				 																																	Wilkinson was injured in a tackle and was treated in the neck and shoulder areas before having to leave the field.				 																																	His three penalties in the first half had given Newcastle a 9-6 interval lead. They won the game 23-19 thanks to second-half tries from Michael Stephenson and Dave Walder. 				 																																	Sydney: Australian super maxi Skandia claimed line honours in the 59th Sydney-Hobart race on Monday after holding off New Zealand rival Zana in a tense tactical battle to the finishing line.				 																																	Skandia sailed slowly across the line in the Derwent River in the island state of Tasmania to record a time of two days, 15 hours 14 minutes and six seconds, almost a day outside the race record.				 																																	Melbourne property developer Grant Wharington tacked his blue-hulled boat more than a dozen times in the final minutes as he sought one last puff of wind to carry it across the finish line before dawn in Hobart.				 																																	London: High-flying Chelsea will be without Argentina midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron for another three weeks while he recovers from a back injury, coach Claudio Ranieri said on Sunday.				 																																	He has started training but will need another 20 days, Ranieri said after his sides 3-0 home win over Portsmouth.				 																																	Veron has not played since returning from international duty six weeks ago. His compatriot, striker Hernan Crespo, has also missed the last two Chelsea games through illness. 				 																																	Ranieri, heartily relieved at Sundays win after losing two Premier League matches this month, added that winger Damien Duff should return in two weeks after dislocating his shoulder against Fulham a week ago. On Sunday they also played without first-choice goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini who has a thigh strain. 				 																																	Bangalore: C. Vijaykumar yet again underlined his status as the countrys top motocross rider with two brilliant rides in the sixth and concluding round of the MRF national motocross championship here on Monday.				 																																	Riding the home-developed TVS 250x, Vijaykumar won both the 12-lap motos in the class-1 Indian experts (foreign motorcycles) cateogry, the showpiece event of the championship.

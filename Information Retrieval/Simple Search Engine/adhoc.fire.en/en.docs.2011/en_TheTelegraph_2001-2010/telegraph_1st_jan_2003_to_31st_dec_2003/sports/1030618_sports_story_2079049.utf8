 Yuvraj slams 71 in vain
 Yuvraj Singh London: Yuvraj Singhs 37-ball 71 was not enough for Yorkshire as they went down by 16 runs against Leicestershire in a Twenty20 Cup North Division match at Grace Road Monday.Chasing 175 in 20 overs, Yorkshire were bowled out for 158.Yuvraj, coming in at the fall of New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, cracked 14 boundaries and a six as he added 95 runs for the second wicket with England allrounder Craig White in just 27 minutes.But Yorkshire suffered a middle-order collapse after the dismissal of the Indian left-hander, losing three more wickets for the addition of 10 runs.For Leicestershire, Brad Hodge slammed 97 from 61 balls and then claimed three for six in his two-over spell.On the other hand, Virender Sehwag was dismissed for his second consecutive nought for Leicestershire against Worcestershire.Sehwag, who scored a duck against Worcestershire in a National League fixture on Sunday, followed it up with a three-ball zero.Ironically, he ended on the winning side. The other notable sub-continent player in the Twenty20 Cup, Pakistans Wasim Akram, had a reasonably good day out. After scoring 24 in Hampshires 145 for six against Kent, the veteran allrounder took two wickets for 29. His efforts, however, paled in the face of some lusty hitting by Kents brawny Aussie import, Andrew Symonds. He hit an unbeaten 96 to take the hosts home with six wickets to spare.  Copyright

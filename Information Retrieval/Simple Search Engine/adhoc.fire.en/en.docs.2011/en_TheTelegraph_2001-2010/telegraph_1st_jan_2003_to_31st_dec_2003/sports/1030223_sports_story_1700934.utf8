 Allan Donald pledges to bounce back
Bloemfontein: Veteran South African paceman Allan Donald pledged on Saturday to bounce back after being dropped for the second time in the World Cup. Donald, 36, sat out in the match against Bangladesh at Goodyear Park here on Saturday. Bangladesh were all out for 108 in 35.1 overs. A lot of people have been telling me this week how I should be bowling and in the nets I have felt very relaxed, said Donald who was denied the opportunity of answering his growing army of critics on his home ground. Things went well in practice and hopefully I will get another chance to put it right out there on the pitch. In a perfect world, I would be playing but the team comes first and they all did a great job.  (AFP)  Copyright

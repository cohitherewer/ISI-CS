The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rohan, Shukla help Bengal draw
 Shukla hit a defiant 87 Mandya: Skipper Rohan Gavaskars defiant, unbeaten 64 and Laxmi Ratan Shuklas 87, and the 164 runs they put on for the seventh wicket, helped Bengal deny Karnataka an outright victory in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match here on Tuesday. Following on, the visitors, who made 228 in their first innings in reply to Karnatakas 411, ended the final day at 318 for seven. Karnataka gained two points from this match, while Bengal, beaten by Rajasthan in their opener, are yet to open their account. The hosts scented victory as Bengal were reduced to 154 for the loss of six wickets at one stage. But Gavaskar and Shukla played sensibly and saved the match. Gavaskar hit eight fours in his 125-ball knock, while Shukla was run out at the fag end of the day. He hit eight fours and three sixes. In the first innings too, Shukla had top-scored with 86. Earlier, Nikhil Haldipur (66) and Amitava Chakraborty (56) shared a 117 run stand for the third wicket after the side was struggling at 22 for two. Dodda Ganesh again grabbed four wickets, to take his total wicket-haul to eight.  (PTI)  Copyright

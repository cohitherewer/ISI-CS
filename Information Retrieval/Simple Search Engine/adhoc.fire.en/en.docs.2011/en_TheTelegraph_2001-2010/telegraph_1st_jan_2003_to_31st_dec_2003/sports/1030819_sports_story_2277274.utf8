The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak chance for home win 
 Pakistans Inzamam-ul Haq, skipper Rashid Latif and Yousuf Youhana at the National Stadium in Karachi on Monday. (AFP) Karachi: Pakistan, winless in a series at home since 1998, have a prime opportunity to start reversing that trend when the first of three Tests against Bangladesh begins on Wednesday. Bangladesh have lost 20 out of 21 Tests, most of them inside three days or by an innings, and have never scored more than 160 against Pakistan. Pakistan have batted just three times in their three Tests against Bangladesh scoring 546 for three, 490 for nine and 465 for nine. But Pakistan captain Rashid Latif was still cautious. I dont want to look to history for confidence. The fact is we have not won a Test series at home since 1998, said Latif. Bangladesh come here after some respectable performances in Australia when you had some critics predicting they would lose in one or two days. I would be surprised if this Bangladesh side is not more competitive against us. Pakistan have lost Test series to Australia, Zimbabwe, Sri Lanka and England since 1998. But they have also seen several tours cancelled since the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and the consequent conflicts in the region. Just two Tests have been played at home since then and the last proper series was in late 2000 against England. Bangladesh are fresh from a two-Test whitewash at the hands of the Australians  (REUTERS)  Copyright

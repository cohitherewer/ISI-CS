 Moses confirms comeback
Paris: Athletics legend Edwin Moses on Sunday confirmed he is making a comeback to the 400m hurdles at the age of 48 with an initial aim of qualifying to run in the trials for the US Olympic team for Athens. The former world record holder, and two-time Olympic champion, held a press conference to officially announce his decision on the day of his 48th birthday. Moses said his first aim was to achieve the time of 50.55 seconds which would qualify him to run in next years US Olympic trials. If it is possible for me to appear at the Olympic trials that would be fantastic as I am an old man, he said. In terms of going to Athens, if things happen they happen. But realistically I cant believe it will.  (AFP)  Copyright

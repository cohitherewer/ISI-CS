 Board warns indisciplined Shoaib
 Shoaib Akhtar  Karachi, April 26 (Reuters): Pakistans controversial  fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has been warned his international  career could be over unless he improves his behaviour.  The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Lt General  Tauqir Zia said: Let me make this clear. If Shoaib does  not improve his behaviour and general discipline, he has  no place in the team. His cricket is finished if he doesnt change his attitude, Zia said Saturday at a meeting of selectors. The 27-year-old speedster was dropped from a one-day tournament in Sharjah last month after being reported for irresponsible behaviour and indiscipline. Shoaib has been recalled to a camp for the upcoming tour of Sri Lanka and the squad is expected next week. Zia said there was no place in the team for players not willing to adhere to strict discipline. My message to Shoaib is, regardless of whatever the selectors might think or plan, in my book, if he cant improve his attitude and become more focussed on cricket, his career is over, Zia said. The Board and myself have supported Shoaib all along and spent a lot of money on his well-being, even when ICC match officials reported his action, said Zia. He was allowed a lot of latitude because we thought he is a genuine match-winner.  Shoaib, who has been reported three times for chucking  before it was discovered he has an abnormally flexible elbow,  has a long history on clashes with team managers.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Depleted Gunners take on Liverpool
 Arsene Wenger has major problems London: Liverpool play host to Arsenal Saturday in a Premier League clash offering both sides a chance to cut their mounting problems down to size. Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has been under fire for his sides lacklustre football and some equally mixed results, which culminated in last weekends embarrassing 2-3 defeat to Charlton after being a goal up. Arsene Wenger, though delighted his Arsenal side are top of the table, faces major problems on both the injury and disciplinary front, with the latter threatening to undermine their season. Victory for either Frenchman at Anfield would therefore be an invaluable morale boost for their players and would also keep their respective critics quiet for a while. Despite a few media brickbats, Houlliers position at Liverpool is not under serious threat. But the euphoria of their trophy treble back in 2001 has gone, their runners-up position in the 2002 league has not been followed by a credible title challenge and they now lie a modest eighth in the table. Reflecting on the fickleness of the press, Houllier told the Liverpool website on Thursday: Had we won at Charlton, people would have been saying I was the Manager of the Month. Instead we lost and people are saying (Celtic boss) Martin ONeill is back in the picture. What makes me angry is when people make such clear-cut judgements on things so early in the season. Houllier also has injury problems of his own, having lost German midfielder Dietmar Hamann before the start of the season and also being without keeper Chris Kirkland, defender Jamie Carragher and Czech striker Milan Baros. Midfielder Danny Murphy is out for up to four weeks with an ankle ligament injury, while Swiss defender Stephane Henchoz is only just coming back from injury. Wengers injury worries are equally acute as he is missing inspirational skipper Patrick Vieira, midfielder Fredrik Ljungberg and forward Dennis Bergkamp on Saturday. There are doubts too over the availability of Sol Campbell, who has not played since Arsenals dismal 0-3 Champions League defeat at home by Inter Milan on September 17, following the death of his father. The England central defender has trained this week and, given the other absences, can be expected to play. Wenger also has disciplinary problems looming with six players facing misconduct charges after last months bust-up at Old Trafford, and some  if not all  risking possible suspension. If there is plenty to prey on Wengers mind, there are some positives to be drawn on by the Highbury faithful.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Masudur on a new mission 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Masudur wants to conquer Palk Strait Calcutta: After the English Channel, its the Palk Strait. Masudur Rahman, the physically challenged city-based swimmer will be out to conquer the seas once again. Its a 22-km stretch between India and Sri Lanka, and Masudur has made an appeal to the Union government to grant the necessary permission. Its a challenging course and I am targeting December, Masudur said. He informed that the preparations are already on in full swing. Other than the English Channel, Masudur has also conquered the Strait of Gibralter. Elaborating on his preparations, the 32-year old added: Currently Im undergoing training at Subhas Sarobar. But I plan to be in Puri for at least 10-15 days in November to be in shape for the course. He added, it is the feel of the salty water which is necessary for the preparation. However, its the jelly-fish and sea-snake in the Palk Strait which seem to bother Masudur a bit. Contact with these creatures create a burning sensation. Theres no way you can take measures against it. He added that it has to be endured along the course. Many of the swimmers fail to carry on. I hope I can bear it. This will also be a challenge for the swimmer who was counted by many to be a spent force following his accident on February 26 near the Eastern by-pass. Many people said Ill never be able to continue again. But I have come back strongly and am desperate to prove the detractors wrong, he said. In fact, Masudur cherishes a dream of working with these upcoming swimmers as their coach. Ive been approached by the state council to train the boys at the junior level. May be, Ill take up the job by October, Masudur added.  Copyright

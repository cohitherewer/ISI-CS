 Court reserves order for today
Pune: The district civil court reserved its order for Friday in the case filed by Abhijit Kale challenging the decision of the BCCI to suspend him from playing first-class cricket. Kale had challenged the suspension on the grounds that the order of suspension issued by the BCCI through Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) was illegal, arbitrary and bad in law. He also pleaded that he be allowed to play Ranji Trophy matches as MCA had officially selected him on merit. The joint civil judge and first class judicial magistrate V. D. Kulkarni heard the counsel for Kale as well as the counsel for BCCI and reserved the order for Friday. The counsel for Kale, Manoj Wadekar, contended in his arguments that the suspension ordered by the BCCI after it had received a written complaint from two national selectors Kiran More and Pranab Roy be kept on hold till the inquiry was over. I am not asking for a stay against the inquiry. All I am asking for is a stay against the suspension order as it is an invasion of civil rights Wadekar argued. Kale received the official letter on Thursday about the appointment of an inquiry committee and a notice asking him to appear before BCCI commissioner D. V. Subba Rao. Kales counsel argued this showed the malafide intention of the BCCI that the notice was delivered to him only after Kale had knocked the doors of court. We managed to locate Kale only today after which the notice was served, MCA chairman Balasaheb Thorve said. MCA had got the notice on Wednesday.  Subba Rao has asked Kale to furnish  whatever details he has within 48 hours. (PTI)  Copyright

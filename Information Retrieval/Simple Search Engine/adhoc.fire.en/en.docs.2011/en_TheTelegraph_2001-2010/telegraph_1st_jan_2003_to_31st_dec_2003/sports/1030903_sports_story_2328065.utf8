The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kapil Dev to return on last two days
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Calcutta: Three years ago, former India captain  and coach Kapil Dev said he wouldnt have anything more  to do with Indian cricket. On Monday and Tuesday, though,  he spent over a dozen hours with the quicks in Bangalore. Its not for me to say how the  sessions went Let the captain or coach or even the fast  bowlers react. However, Ill be back on the last two days  (Friday, Saturday) of the conditioning camp, Kapil told  The Telegraph, moments after returning to New Delhi  late on Tuesday. While Mondays interaction was strictly indoors, Kapils tips were out in the open on Day II. Actually, my last session was devoted to observing everyones action Theres certainly room for improvement, he added. Now that Kapil has had a rethink, the Board should utilise his services more often.  Copyright

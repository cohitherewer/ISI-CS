The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sri Lankan home record under threat
 Atapattu feels the series is still open Dambulla: Sri Lankas five-year winning stretch in limited-overs series at home is under threat as the hosts brace for the second round of the tri-series against Pakistan and New Zealand, when pace bowlers are again expected to dominate. Sri Lanka have won every limited-overs series they have hosted since July 1998, but their record is in danger as New Zealand and Pakistan appear better equipped to exploit the fast pitches at Dambullas Rangiri Stadium. But were out to defend our home record, its a matter of great pride for us and were not going to give it up without a fight, said Sri Lankan skipper Maravan Atapattu. We mean business, and were in the contest for winning this title. The fresh pitches at the Rangiri Stadium, which had hosted only one limited-overs International before this series, have neutralised Sri Lankas spin bowling advantage. With the batting line-up in a form slump, the decision to switch the second round and the final to Dambulla from Colombo due to wet conditions in the capital could help finish Sri Lankas winning run at home. The lively wicket and the overcast weather seems to be better suited for our rivals, Atapattu conceded ahead of Sundays crucial second-leg encounter with Pakistan. The Sri Lankans lost by 79 uns to Pakistan in the series opener, then beat New Zealand by five wickets. The victory over New Zealand has put us back on track, Atapattu said. All teams have a win and a loss apiece, although New Zealand lead with two bonus points from their comprehensive win over Pakistan and Pakistan have one bonus point from their big win over the hosts. The series is still wide open, we just need our middle-order batsmen to strike form, Atapattu said. Pakistans coach and former Test captain Javed Miandad said the one point bonus was negligible, and all three teams have a good chance of going into the second round. Im a bit concerned with the fact that winning the toss was a crucial factor, Miandad said on Friday. New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming also said luck of the toss was a crucial factor on the seaming and bouncing pitches. Unfortunately a lot depends on the toss, Fleming said. Such is the nature of the wicket, its always going to do something. Sri Lankas chief pitch adviser Anuruddha Polonowita said only a strong sun could bake the pitches and shift the orientation back toward the batsmen because the moisture content in the middle of the field was very high. With Pakistans 199 for eight the highest total in the series, Polonowita said two new pitches were being prepared for the second round and would be likely to produce more runs.  (AP)  Copyright

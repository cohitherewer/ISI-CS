 Edward Loar of the US doffs his cap after winning the 37th Thailand Open in Bangkok Sunday. (AFP) New Delhi: Indian golfers continued to make their presence felt in the Asian PGA Tour with Delhi golfer Gaurav Ghei finishing joint seventh in the $150,000 Thailand Open which was won by American Edward Loar on Sunday. Chandigarh pro Amandeep Johl was the other Indian who managed to make his mark finishing joint tenth on the leaderboard, according to information received here. Johl had rounds of 71-67-68-72. It was the first ever title as a pro for the left-handed Loar who aggregated a four-round score of 19-under par 269. Runner up Jason Dawes of Australia was five strokes adrift of Loar at 274. Taiwanese duo Chen Yuan-chi and Lin Wen-tang shared the third place. Ghei, who was two-under on the opening day and shot a superb seven-under 65 in the third round, managed a par round on the final day to tally 277. The other two golfers who returned an identical final score were Jasem Knutzon of the US and Thaworn Wiratchant of the host nation. Ghei had failed to impress in the previous leg of the APGA Tour, the Royal Challenge Indian Open played in New Delhi from March 27 to 30, languishing at joint 27th place with eight others.

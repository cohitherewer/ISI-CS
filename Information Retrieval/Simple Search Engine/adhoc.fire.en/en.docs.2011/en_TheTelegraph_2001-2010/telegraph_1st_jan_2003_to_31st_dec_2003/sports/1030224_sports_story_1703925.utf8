 Title for Sania 
Hyderabad: Top seed Sania Mirza defeated Franziska Etzel of Germany 6-3, 6-3 in the final of the $10,000 Nigerian Open at Benin City, according to information received here on Sunday. Sania won $1,600 and five WTA points for her effort. She broke her rival in the first set to chalk up a comfortable 5-2 lead but the German held her serve to reduce the margin. Finally, the 16-year-old Hyderabad girl took the set 6-3 with deep serves to her rivals backhand. The second set saw Etzel holding her own and the first six games went with the serve but Sania bounced back with some brilliant forehand passing shots that brooked no reply from the German.

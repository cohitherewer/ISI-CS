The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kalyani bids official farewell
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Kalyani treasures Hadlees compliments Calcutta: Former Bengal batsman Srikant Kalyani on Wednesday formally submitted to the CAB his decision to quit first class cricket. A shade over two months shy of his 38th birthday, Kalyani will leave for home town Pune in a fortnight to join his brother in his family business of readymade garments. This ends his 11-year romance with Bengal. He has played 101 first class matches, having scored 6,306 runs at an average of 49.65. He has scored 14 centuries with a career-best of 260 versus Karnataka. He also remembered his 81 for West Zone against the visiting New Zealand side in Rajkot in 1988-89. It stays in my memory because Richard Hadlee had called me aside after the innings and said rather good words about my batting. His regret is not being able to make it to the national team. The Indian middle order was packed with great bats. I simply had no hope. My shift to Bengal was finally of no use.  Copyright

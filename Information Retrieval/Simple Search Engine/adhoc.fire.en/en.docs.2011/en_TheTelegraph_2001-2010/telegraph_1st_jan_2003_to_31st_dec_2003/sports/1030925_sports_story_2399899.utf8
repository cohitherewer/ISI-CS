 Jugraj in the dark 
 Jugraj is not sure where he will be taken now Ludhiana: Star hockey player Jugraj Singh, who will be discharged from the Dayanand Medical College and Hospital in a day or so, said he did not know where he would be sent for advanced physiotherapy. According to Jugraj, the only thing conveyed to him with any certainty was that the Union government has decided to bear the expenses of his physiotherapy abroad. It is yet to be finalised as to where the physiotherapy will be carried out, Jugraj said on Wednesday. The penalty corner ace said he only knew, that too through newspaper reports, that the destination could be anywhere from the US, Australia, Germany or South Africa. Though IOA and IHF officials have taken copies of the CDs of his fractures and the treatment so far, no one has asked for his passport. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and the IOA had assured the star he would be taken abroad for treatment, if necessary. Jugraj sustained multiple-fractures in a car crash in Jalandhar recently, forcing him to miss the Asia Cup currently on in Kuala Lumpur. According to former skipper Ramandeep Singh, IHF vice-president Dr Narinder Batra had told him that Jugraj would be shifted to New Delhis Batra Hospital, where the drag-flickers right elbow, broken into seven pieces, would be set right. Ramandeep added that the Sahara Group had offered use of their helicopter to take Jugraj to the capital, but the date for the airlift has not been finalised yet. Meanwhile, head of the orthopaedic department at the Dayanand Medical College said they had completed their job and were ready to discharge Jugraj for further treatment.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Tim claims 100m gold 
 Tim Montgomery reacts after winning the 100m final at the Japan Grand Prix in Osaka Saturday. (Reuters) Osaka, May 10 (Agencies): World record-holder Tim Montgomery edged out Australian Patrick Johnson to win a hotly contested 100m in 10.04 at the Japan Grand Prix in Osaka Saturday. Running his second race since setting a new world mark of 9.78 last September, Montgomery almost turned his ankle over after 75 metres but hung on, dipping first at the tape to snatch a morale-boosting victory by just 0.01 seconds. I went to hit it like I always do but I went over on my left ankle and had to catch myself from falling on him, said the 28-year-old American. Johnson set an Australian record of 9.93, the fastest time in the world this year, in Mito, Japan on Monday and put a positive spin on his narrow defeat in Osaka. The best in the world beat me by one hundredth. I lost it on the dip. But the 9.93 is still the tip of the iceberg for me, said the 30-year-old. Japanese 200 m specialist Shingo Suetsugu finished third in 10.16. Meanwhile, world indoor champion Tyree Washington won the 400m in 44.97 with fellow American Calvin Harrison second in 45.32. Australian Clinton Hill took third in 45.39. Dudley Dorival of Haiti won the 110 metres hurdles in 13.49 ahead of Jamaican Maurice Wignall (13.50) and American Duane Ross (13.51) at the Nagai Stadium in Osaka, venue for the 2007 world championships. Sydney Olympic champion Nick Hysong of the US won the pole vault with a mark of 5.50 m, while world champion Dmitri Markov of Australia failed three attempts at 5.40 m. In the womens competition, Olympic and world silver medallist Olga Kuzenkova of Russia took the hammer throw gold with a toss of 71.33 m.  Copyright

 Win puts Chandhok on top
Chennai: Karun Chandhok has grabbed the lead in the 24-round British Formula 3 (scholarship class) championship by winning the 15th race at the Rockingham speedway on Sunday. The 19-year-old, who has scored five wins in the last eight starts, now tops the championship race with 220 points with eight races to go and is closely followed by Steven Kane (Ireland, 218) and Ernesto Viso (Venezuela, 200), according to information received here. In the 16th race also held on Sunday, Chandhok finished runner-up to Viso. The Indian, competing in the British Formula 3 for the second year in succession, proved his mettle as he clinched pole position for the 15th race. The car was working really well. Viso had done more testing here than us but I am really confident and looking forward to maintaining my position on the championship points table, Chandhok said. Chandhok opened the season winning in Donnington Park and then scored a hattrick winning at Croft and two more at the Silverstone circuit. Besides, he had finished second and third twice each and fourth once. He did not finish in three other events. The qualifying seemed to go Chandhoks way as he caused a surprise in the first session. Out of the pits in third place, he clocked 1:29.45 seconds, which stood as the pole position time till the session was over.  (PTI)  Copyright

Well be cautious and wont go for the kill from the beginning. Even if we settle for a point, its ok for me, he added. Bhowmick, however, sounded a bit worried about Mike Okoros form. Okoros form is a concern for me. He played so well last season and helped us win some crucial matches. I know hell just come out of this phase any day and deliver the goods for us, he felt of the Nigerian. East Bengal coach lavished praise on his opposite in the Tollygunge Agragami. As a player Krishnendu (Roy) was known for his fighting attitude. And as a coach he seems to have injected that same fighting spirit into his wards. The team is really looking impressive under him. Krishnendu, however, returned the compliment hailing Bhowmick and his team as the best in the country. East Bengal may be undergoing a bad patch. But no doubt they are the best team and have the best coach in their ranks, opined the former Indian defender. Krishnendu, however, pointed out East Bengal captain Suley Musah was the main threat to his team. There is a lot of talk about the Bhaichung-Okoro combination, but a significant part of that teams success depends on Musahs runs down the right., revealed Krishnendu. He further added the team would maintain same 4-4-2 combination against East Bengal. Meanwhile, Bhowmick said he would reply to the IFAs showcause notice for making anti-association comments soon.

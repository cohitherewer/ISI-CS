 Anand draws with Kramnik
Dortmund: World Cup champion Viswanathan Anand drew with world No. 2 GM Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the fourth round of the Dortmund Sparkassen chess meeting here Sunday. GM Arkadi Naiditsch of Germany was the star of the day, defeating GM Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan with white and sending alarm signals to the elite group that he is going to join them very soon. The other game of the day, between GM Peter Leko of Hungary and GM Viktor Bologan of Moldova was poised to end in a draw and that would mean underdog Bologan maintaining his lead at the top of the tables. As things stand now, Kramnik has joined Bologan at the top on 2.5 points, with the former still having the in-progress game in hand. Naiditsch has moved to 2 points with his enviable effort against Radjabov who remained on 1.5 along with GM Peter Leko of Hungary who has the same score which he is likely to improve after the ongoing game. Anand is still on the cellar, having just one point in his kitty so far, having lost two important games against Bologan and Radjabov in two preceding rounds. Playing against Kramnik has never been an easy call for Anand and it was attested to by Sundays game that the Indian ace drew without giving any major problems to the only player after Garri Kasparov of Russia to have scaled the 2800 mark on the Fides elo rating charts. It was yet another Sveshnikov of the tournament and it was quite evident that Anand did not quite find a way to continue while retaining chances, when confronted with this opening. Kramnik faced little trouble with the oft-repeated opening and drew without much ado after Anand sacrificed his queen for two minor pieces and one pawn. The game lasted just 25 moves. Naiditsch was the hero of the day as he beat Radjabov with white.It was a Sicilian defence where Naiditsch got a firm hold after Radjabov went for unwarranted complications with a piece sacrifice. The German, however, was quite prepared to tackle the ensuing complications. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NFL likely to kick off in city
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The eighth edition of the National Football League (NFL) is likely to kick off in the city. The NFL organising committee will hold a meeting here on November 19 to study the tournament fixtures. However, according to sources close to the IFA, the state governing body has been asked to get prepared tentatively to host the opening match of the NFL. In a related development, the IFA will host the Super Cup  between last years NFL champions East Bengal and Federation Cup holders Mahindra United  and will be held on November 19 at Salt Lake Stadium from 2 pm. It was learnt that the IFA had initially wanted to push the match back for a couple of days in view of the November 18 tri-series final at Eden Gardens. But the AIFF didnt agree with any change in schedule. Meanwhile, Subrata Sarkar, a Fifa-referee from the state, will officiate the pre-World Cup qualifier between Tajikistan and Bangladesh, to be held in Tajikistan on November 30. The IFA has received a letter from Mohun Bagan, protesting against permission granted to East Bengals Alvito DCunha to take part in the IFA Shield play-off final. A letter from the club seeking reimbursement of insurance cover for Ashim Biswas, who was injured during the IFA Super Division meet, also reached the association office.  Copyright

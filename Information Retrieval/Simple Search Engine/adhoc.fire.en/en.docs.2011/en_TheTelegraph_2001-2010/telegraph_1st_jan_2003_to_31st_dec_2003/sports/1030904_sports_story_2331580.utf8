The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real manage a draw 
 Ronaldinho stars for Barcelona Madrid: A late goal by substitute Antonio Nunez earned Real Madrid a 1-1 draw away to a well-organised Villarreal side in their second match of the season on Tuesday. The young midfielder, making his League debut for Real, got his head to an outswinging David Beckham corner four minutes from time to cancel out a spectacular strike by Villarreal substitute Sonny Anderson. The goal of the night, though, came from Barcelonas Ronaldinho who scored with a brilliant solo effort to earn his side a 1-1 draw against Sevilla on his home debut in a late-night match. The Brazilian skipped his way past two defenders before letting rip with an unstoppable shot from the edge of the area early in the second half to neutralise Jose Antonio Reyess 10th-minute penalty for the visitors. England captain Beckham, who scored after just three minutes of his home League debut on Saturday, made a less spectacular start for Real this time out, but gradually found his range from set pieces, nearly grabbing the winner with two dipping free kicks at the death. The midfielder suffered a minor groin injury during the match but told reporters he expects to be fit for Englands Euro 2004 qualifier against Macedonia on Saturday. Beckham went down clutching his ankle after a first-half challenge with Rodolfo Arruabarrena but the England captain picked himself up to receive a yellow card for going in with his studs raised. In other matches last seasons runners-up Real Sociedad were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Celta Vigo. Valencia were the only winners of the night after they claimed a 1-0 win over Osasuna.

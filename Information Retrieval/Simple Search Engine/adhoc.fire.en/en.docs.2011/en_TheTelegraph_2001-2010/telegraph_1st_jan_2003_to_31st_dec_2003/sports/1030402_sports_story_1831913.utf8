 Sachin surgery
Mumbai: The finger injury to Sachin Tendulkar will not only keep him out of the tri-nation meet in Bangladesh, but from all international engagements for two months. Sachin, the top-scorer at the World Cup with a record 673 runs, said here Tuesday that his finger needed to be operated upon and would keep him out of action for two months. The master batsman had already requested the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) not to pick him for the Dhaka tournament starting on April 11.  (PTI)  Copyright

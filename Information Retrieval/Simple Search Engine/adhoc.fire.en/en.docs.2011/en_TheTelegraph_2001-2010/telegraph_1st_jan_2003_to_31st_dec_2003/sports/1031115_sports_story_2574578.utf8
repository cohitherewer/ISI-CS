The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shabbir likely for Ranadeb
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Bengal will look to redeem themselves when they take on Karnataka in their second Ranji Trophy Elite Group match in Mandya on Saturday. Batting has been one of the biggest worries for the visitors, who suffered a humiliating 152-run loss in their opening game against Rajasthan. But we cannot brood over that loss, Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri told The Telegraph over phone from Mandya. Bengal have been forced to make one change in their batting order, with Nikhil Haldipur coming in place of Devang Gandhi, who opted out because of personal reasons. We plan to move Sanjeeb Sanyal up the order to lend some stability towards the top, Ghavri informed. In that case, Subhamoy Das will come down the order. Bengal, however, are likely to effect one change in their bowling line-up with pacer Shabbir Ali replacing Ranadeb Bose.  Copyright

 Facing India Paks real test: Imran 
Islamabad: Imran Khan praised Pakistan for their recent home series win against South Africa but said the real test for the side would come when they are up against India. I always thought Pakistan should beat South Africa at home because there are few teams that have beaten us in Pakistan, the former Pakistan skipper said. (But) the real test for the team will be playing outside Pakistan or playing against India (at home or away), because they have similar conditions, said Imran, awaiting an exciting series between the two sub-continental rivals, following the Indian governments go-ahead in reviving bilateral cricketing ties. Pakistan-India series will be an exciting one, the 1992 World Cup winning captain who is in Jeddah to perform umrah, was quoted as saying in media reports here. The contrast in bowling and batting line-ups between the arch-rivals makes their game more interesting he said. Pakistans bowling is much better than Indias but Indian batting looks better than Pakistan.  Imran said the induction of new players like Taufeeq Umar and Imran Farhat was a good sign.

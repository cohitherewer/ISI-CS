The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Annika ready for 5th major
Wilmington (Delaware): Annika Sorenstam, following her victory in the Kellogg-Keebler Classic Sunday, is in prime form for this weeks McDonalds LPGA Championship and believes she is due a fifth career major win. The 32-year-old Swede coasted home by three shots on her return to the LPGA Tour, after her much-hyped appearance alongside the men at the PGA Tours Colonial tournament, but readily concedes her results in the majors could be better. I definitely want to win more and this year Ive set my preparations towards the majors, said Sorenstam, who has won two U.S. Opens and two Nabisco Championships. I feel really good coming into this week. It was great to be back, and to win, on the LPGA (Tour). Although Sorenstam has never won the LPGA Championship, she has a fine record in the tournament with three top-10 finishes, including a third behind the triumphant Pak Se Ri last year. Her confidence will be sky-high after her comfortable victory at the weekend, a perfect warm-up for the second womens major of the year which starts at DuPont Country Club Thursday. The Swede, the first female player to compete in a PGA Tour event since Babe Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open, confirmed she is a class apart in the womens game by finishing at 17-under 199 after three rounds at Stonebridge Country Club. It was her second win of the season and helped her leapfrog South Koreas Pak Se Ri into her familiar spot at the top of the LPGA Tours money list with earnings of $734,501. Sorenstam, who missed the cut at the Colonial, had always insisted the PGA Tour experience was a one-off test against the best in the world, and it is among her own kind that she still wants to break records.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 16 careers sacrificed in official clamour
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta: The continuous  conflict between the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI)  and Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA) has finally taken  its toll. Now that the BTTA has been disaffiliated by the  TTFI, 16 young players will be denied entry to the team  events of the sub-junior and cadet national table tennis  championships starting in Ajmer on Friday.  According to a senior BTTA official, the state body  filled up the entry form and sent it with the names of 16  players and three officials. He said the form was accepted  by the organisers. But we came to know today that the jury committee (of the meet) decided not to allow us to take part, since we have moved the court against the federations decision to disaffiliate us he said.  Confirming the development, TTFI  vice president Prabir Mitra told The Telegraph on  Thursday: Since BTTA has been disaffiliated, the players,  sent by the body, cannot participate in the team events.  However, they may represent the state in individual events. The Bengal squad includes young prospects like Agamoni Mitra, Pritam Basu, Joyita Pushilal and Sourav Basu Roy. The squad left for Ajmer by the Jodhpur Express on Tuesday and reached the venue on Thursday.  Despite several efforts the BTTA and TTFI have failed  to close ranks and the federation has finally decided to  disaffiliate the state body recently.  Copyright

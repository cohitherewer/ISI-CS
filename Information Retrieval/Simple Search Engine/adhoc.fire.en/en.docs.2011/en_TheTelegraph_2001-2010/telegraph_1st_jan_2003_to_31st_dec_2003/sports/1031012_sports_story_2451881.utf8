The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jones awed by Hayden feat
Rawalpindi, Oct. 11 (AFP): Former Australian batsman Dean Jones today said he was fascinated by compatriot Matthew Haydens world record 380 runs. I am really happy for Hayden, he is a class act. He always promised to hit a big knock because once he does get a 100 he tends to make it 200 and more, Jones, who is here as commentator, said. There will be more expectations of him, one knock doesnt make a career, but helps it and the way he is playing I hope that many runs to come, Jones, who played 52 Tests and 164 ODIs for Australia in 1980s and 90s, said. Jones said Hayden had no visible weakness in his batting. He wasnt good against spinners a few years back but hit a double hundred in Chennai two years ago and from there he started to learn how to play spin.  Copyright

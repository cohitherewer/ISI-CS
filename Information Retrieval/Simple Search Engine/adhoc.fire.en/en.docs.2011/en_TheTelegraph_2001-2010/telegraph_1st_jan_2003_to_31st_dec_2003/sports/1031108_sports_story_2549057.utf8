 Clijsters enters semis
 Belgiums Kim Clijsters returns a shot to Chanda Rubin of the US in Los Angeles on Thursday. (AP) Los Angeles: Justine Henin-Hardenne clawed her way to a three-set victory over Anastasia Myskina in her opening match of the WTA tour championships as arch-rival Kim Clijsters booked a semi-final berth with her second straight-set win here Thursday. Henin-Hardenne, who arrived in Los Angeles nursing a cold and sinus infection, dropped the first five games of the opening set to Myskina, then reeled off seven games with the aid of on-court medical treatment. I was having trouble breathing because of the cold Ive had the last few days, she said. I was short of breath. I explained it to the doctors. Myskina said the injury time-out didnt distract her. It didnt affect me, she said. It was my mistake. I let her play better. It was my fault. Myskina came out ahead at the end of a see-saw second set, breaking Henin-Hardenne in the 12th game after they had twice traded breaks. Leading 5-4 in the third, Myskina pushed Henin-Hardenne to 0-30 on the Belgians serve, but couldnt earn the winning break. Instead, Henin-Hardenne earned the decisive break in the 11th game as Myskina double-faulted to give her break point then netted a forehand. The Belgian served out with a love game to wrap up the match after two-and-a-half hours. I came through, thats the most important thing today, Henin-Hardenne said. Its an important victory. If she makes the semis, she will lock up the season-ending No. 1 ranking.  Meanwhile, current world No. 1 Clijsters booked her place in the last-four with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Chanda Rubin. Its nice, Clijsters said. Ive played two good matches. To be the first one, its a relief I think, as well.  Clijsters led 4-1 and then 5-2 in the first set, but couldnt capitalise on her six set points in the eighth game as Rubin fought back to narrow the gap to 5-4.  Clijsters converted her seventh set point when Rubin missed a backhand volley. When I had to do it, I did it, Clijsters said. Thats the most important thing  to be strongest at the moment when you have to be. I was up two breaks, she added. And its very unusual to lose a match when youre up two breaks. Even when she broke to go to 5-4, I still had to serve for it. Rubin could not find a way through in the second set, failing to earn a break point. Clijsters broke her to love with a perfectly placed lob to lead 4-3, held her own serve to love in the next game and  after Rubin held serve  took the match with another love game. Rubins defeat, coupled with her opening win over Amelie Mauresmo on Wednesday, left her vying with the Frenchwoman for the second semi-final spot from the Red Group. Mauresmo must beat Clijsters in her final round-robin match. Rubin will face Dementieva when round-robin play wraps up Saturday.  (Reuters)  Copyright

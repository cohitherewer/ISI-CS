The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A total team effort: Bhutia 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhutia  Calcutta: East Bengal are a step away from reaching the ASEAN Club Championship final but their man of the moment says the time isnt ripe to celebrate yet.We havent done anything. We must win this tournament to say we have achieved something, Bhaichung Bhutia told The Telegraph from Jakarta on Monday. Weve still got to work very hard.It was a tough match and its always difficult to play in front of a crowd thats cheering the home team. Todays was a total team effort, said the inspirational striker. They (Persita Tangerang) were a tough side, but we played very well in the second half. But, of the three matches we have played so far, the first one (against BEC Tero Sasana) was clearly the toughest.Bhutia insisted the penalty awarded against East Bengal was a poor verdict. But overall, he felt the referee did a decent job. About his own form, Bhutia said he is happy as long as the team succeeds. Its a question of luck as well. I always look for goals, sometimes they come and sometimes they dont, said Bhutia.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhupathi, Paes drawn in same half
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: At the French Open, Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi had met each other in the quarter finals  their first clash in a major mens doubles championship. Paes had won that three-set battle with his Czech partner David Rikl, even though Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi had been in the drivers seat for the better part of the opening two sets. If the seedings hold, the two could confront each other again at the grasscourt Grand Slam  but not before the semi-final stage this time. The top seeds have been drawn in the same half as the No. 5 seeds, with US Open champions Bhupathi and Mirnyi scheduled to open against James Auckland and Lee Childs. Paes and Rikl will start against Juan Carlos Ferrero and Juan Ignacio Carrasco.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachin was my greatest worry
 Sydney: Like many captains throughout the world, former Australian skipper Mark Taylors biggest worry while playing against India was how to get Sachin Tendulkar out.My greatest anxiety was how to get Sachin Tendulkar out. He even played Shane Warne so well, Taylor said here on Friday.Tendulkar has an enviable record against the Aussies, scoring the most number of centuries against the world champions and continues to be an enigma for them. Like his successor Steve Waugh, Taylor also rates India as a special country. Taylor recalled the Test Australia won in Bangalore in 1998 and his own century as also the 1996 match where the then Indian skipper Mohammed Azharuddin was given out in controversial circumstances. Bottles came flying on the field when Azhar was given out. The good news was the game resumed after 30 minutes but the sad part was that we lost the match.Taylor, who was one of the 147 cricketers who would be presented the baggy green cap at a reunion party of past and present Australian players, admitted it was indeed a special occasion for all concerned.The baggy green cap is a wonderful keepsake. It is universally recognised as the greatest symbol of world sport.I keep it well secured at home but dont lock it away as I want to keep going back to it, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

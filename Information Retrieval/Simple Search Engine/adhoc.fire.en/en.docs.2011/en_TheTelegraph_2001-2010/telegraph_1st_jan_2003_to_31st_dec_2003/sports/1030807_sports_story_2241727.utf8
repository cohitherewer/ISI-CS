 Dav looks at positives
 Whatmore feels Bangla have a better chance  against PakistanDarwin: Bangladesh must guard against a loss of confidence following their loss to Australia in the three-match one-day series, coach Dav Whatmore warned on Wednesday. Whatmore said his fledgling team has learned tough lessons along the series Down Under. But the biggest lesson was the sheer strength of the Australian side, he said. Whatmore said Bangladesh shouldnt feel let-down, in spite of the string of defeats. He felt several positives have emerged from the tour, one of them being young fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza  who took two for 41.  The only thing we have got to  guard against is a loss of confidence, Whatmore said. If  we can watch that carefully and still come up with as much  effort as we can, I think there is some light at the end  of the tunnel.  (AFP)  Copyright

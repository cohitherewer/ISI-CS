The Telegraph - Calcutta
 South Africa maintain iron grip over England
 Graeme Smith celebrates  reaching his double century on Day II of the second  Test at Lords on Friday. (AP) London, Aug. 2 (AFP): South Africa were eight wickets away from an innings victory at stumps on the third day of the second Test at Lords on Saturday after piling on the misery for hapless England. At close, England were 129 for two in their second innings, needing another 381 runs to make the Proteas bat again after South Africa declared at a Test best 682 for six. Mark Butcher and Nasser Hussain were batting on 33 and 36, respectively, with the home side already having lost both openers  skipper Michael Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick. South Africas total surpassed their previous record 622 for nine declared against Australia at Durban in 1969-70. Captain Graeme Smith finally got out for 259.  Copyright

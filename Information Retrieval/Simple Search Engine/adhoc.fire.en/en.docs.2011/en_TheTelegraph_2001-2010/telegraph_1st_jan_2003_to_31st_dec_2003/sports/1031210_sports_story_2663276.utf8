 Sheharyar new PCB chief
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Islamabad: Former foreign secretary Sheharyar Khan was appointed new chief of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday. This ends a week of speculation following the sudden resignation of former PCB chief Tauqir Zia. The announcement was made by the PCBs patron-in-chief President Pervez Musharraf. A career diplomat, known for his penchant for cricket, Sheharyar held several ambassadorial posts besides acting as special UN envoy. Zia resigned last week after a row between the state run Pakistan Television (PTV) and the private GEO channel over telecast rights of the Pakistan-New Zealand one-day series. The dispute deprived millions of fans from watching the first one-dayer. Zia had handed a big contract to GEO, which at the eleventh hour refused to allow PTV to telecast the match for domestic viewers. Musharraf had to intervene to settle the dispute followed by Zias resignation. Zia had been under fire for quite sometime also because of the controversial inclusion of his son Junaid in the national team. Many of his critics believe that Zia should have been sacked or should have resigned following Pakistans humiliating ouster from the World Cup, a daily reported. Military officers are placed atop non-military organisations because they are supposed to streamline things better. Zia was acting as PCB chief as well as the Corps Commander of Mangla Cantonment in south-east of Islamabad from 1999 before retiring a few months ago.  Copyright

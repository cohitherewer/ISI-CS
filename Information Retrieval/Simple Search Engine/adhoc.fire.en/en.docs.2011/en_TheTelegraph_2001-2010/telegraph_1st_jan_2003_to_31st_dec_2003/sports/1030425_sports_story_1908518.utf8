The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harbhajan: I only played in Dhaka at Souravs request
 - Kaif approached by Derbyshire; Counties interested inYuvraj  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  chemistry: Sourav and Harbhajan Calcutta: Its no secret that the Board persuaded Sourav Ganguly to undertake the Dhaka trip despite a bad back. What isnt known is that the Team India captain himself did some persuading: It was at his request that Harbhajan Singh didnt pull out (of the tri-series) on grounds of fitness. Actually, Id asked Dada (Sourav) to inform the Board that I needed to rest my spinning fingers That (because of pain) even I had to skip Dhaka. Dada, however, said I must not opt out as five players had already made themselves unavailable. Then, he promised I wouldnt have to play all matches. Of course, I could have personally spoken to the Board president, but decided against doing as Dada had a point about our attack having been weakened (by pull outs). Moreover, main unko kabhi naa nahin kar sakta hoon, Harbhajan told The Telegraph, when contacted on his cellphone. The key off-spinner, 22, has suffered wear and tear in the region between the index and middle fingers of his right hand. If I dont rest for two months, I may have to undergo surgery. Today, therefore, Ive got to think of my career and thats why Im not going to Lancashire  not now, at least, he added. Had circumstances been different, Harbhajan would have been in Manchester by now, keeping Stuart Law company in the overseas players bench at Old Trafford. Significantly, Lancashire will wait four-six weeks before deciding on a replacement. This got confirmed when the Countys chief executive, Jim Cumbes, was contacted exclusively Thursday evening. The star offie, by the way, isnt going to review matters till he has had adequate rest. The pain started during the home series versus the West Indies (late last year) and resurfaced in New Zealand. I was given pain-killers and a cortisone shot The pain, though, returned during the World Cup. Given the importance of the event, I had to carry on, he revealed. According to Harbhajan, he was referred to a specialist by (physio) Andrew Leipus on the eve of the World Cup final, in Johannesburg, and advised complete rest. Right now, Im religiously doing the exercises prescribed by the specialist That and a break should repair the damage caused by non-stop cricket for the past two years, he pointed out. Meanwhile, its understood that Mohammed Kaif has been approached by Derbyshire as a mid-summer replacement for Shahid Afridi. Michael Di Venuto is the Countys other overseas pro. Apparently, a couple of Counties seem interested in Yuvraj Singh, too. In fact, it wont surprise if Derbyshire turn to him should negotiations with Kaif fail. With a big question mark over Harbhajan, only two Indians  Jawagal Srinath (Durham) and Virender Sehwag (Leicestershire)  are sure to figure on the County circuit. Srinath, though, has just been contracted for the first couple of months.  Copyright

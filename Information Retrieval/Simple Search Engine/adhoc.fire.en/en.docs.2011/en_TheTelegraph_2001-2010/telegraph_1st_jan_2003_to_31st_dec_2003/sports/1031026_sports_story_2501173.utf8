The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ghavri has hernia surgery
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Oct. 25: Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri had a hernia operation at the Belle Vue Clinic on Saturday. He was hospitalised Friday night and the operation under Dr. S.K. Paul took about 45 minutes. Ghavri is recovering well and should be back at Bengal practice in about a week. Talking to The Telegraph on Saturday evening, Ghavri said: There was a bit of pain for last few days. I decided to undergo the operation as soon as possible because Bengals Ranji engagements start early November. Ghavri, who expects to be discharged in a couple of days, ruled out any chance of going back to Mumbai for rest. Ill be in the city and hope to be back in practice in about seven days, he added. The Bengal practice, however, will continue under assistant coach Satinder Singh.  Umpires seminar The Bengal umpires had a motivational session under professional motivator Soumitra Chattopadhaya at the Rotary Sadan on Saturday. Chattopadhaya had earlier worked with the Bengal senior team as well. The CAB secretary Bablu Kolay informed that the umpires also had an audio-visual training session under Mumbai umpire M.R. Singh followed by a question and answer session.  Copyright

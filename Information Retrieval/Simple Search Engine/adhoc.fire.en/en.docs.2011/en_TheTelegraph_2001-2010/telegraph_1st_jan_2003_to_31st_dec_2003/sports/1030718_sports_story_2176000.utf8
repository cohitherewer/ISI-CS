The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Match called off due to rain
London: Rain put paid to the aspirations of India A to pull off a win as their three-dayer against Surrey was abandoned without a ball being bowled on the final day on Thursday. Indians were in the drivers seat when play ended on a rain-marred second day, having piled up 462 for four before declaring their first innings.  (PTI)  Copyright

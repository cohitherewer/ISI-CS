The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain best since Brearley
 - WISDEN POLL - Few backers for England regaining Ashes in 2005  Hussain ranks fourth among post-War England captains London: Nasser Hussain may have faced criticism galore during his tenure, but a general public opinion still rates him the best England skipper since the legendary Mike Brearley. Despite an abrupt end to his captaincy, Hussain is well ahead of the likes of Michael Atherton, Mike Gatting and Graham Gooch, according to a survey commissioned to mark the publication of the first issue of the Wisden Cricketer magazine. Hussain is placed at a creditable fourth on the overall list among the post-War captains behind Peter May, Ray Illingworth and Brearley, the magazine said in a release. But there was bad news for Hussains successor Michael Vaughan, as only half the respondents gave any chance to his team winning back the Ashes in 2005. About 70 per cent of them in fact thought Shane Warne should be picked to play for Australia again despite his recent controversies. According to the survey a huge majority, 92 per cent, people supported the idea of umpires being treated more like players, with those consistently making poor decisions being dropped. About 65 per cent voters were against the use of hawk-eye technology for leg before decisions but 55 per cent supported the use of more technology to get correct decisions. Seven out of 10 English cricket fans believed that corruption was still a part of the cricket world but fewer than one third said that they spoilt their enjoyment of the game. The English fans seemed to have no objection to sledging at the international level with half putting their weight behind the practice.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lacklustre win for Md. Sporting
 - SUPER DIVISION l Satish Minzs long-ranger spares black-and-white brigade the blushes  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Syed Rahim Nabi struggles to breach the Railway FC defence in Tuesdays Super Division clash at Salt Lake Stadium. Mohammedan Sporting won 1-0. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: A long-ranger, taken more in hope rather than with any great intent, bailed out Mohammedan Sporting in their CFL Super Division clash with Railway FC at Salt Lake Stadium Tuesday afternoon. Satish Minzs 30-yard shot, which took wings and dipped in to beat Rabindranath Poddar in the 22nd minute, ensured Mohammedan Sportings return to winning ways after being sunk by Calcutta Port Trust last week. The bottomline was satisfactory, but there was hardly any spark in the Mohammedan Sporting performance. Communication among the medios was non-existent, the strikers  denied a regular supply of passes  didnt show the inclination to fall back and create something on their own, even the reliable central defenders and goalkeeper were exposed by the occasional railway bursts. Its been the same story in all three matches Mohammed Habeebs boys have played so far. There have been the occasional individual spark  like a Bungo Singh sprint-and-shoot routine, a Dipendu Biswas back-volley attempt, or a Minz solo down the right flank. But the players have shown no signs of gelling as a team. The goal apart, two chances came Mohammedan Sportings way in the first session. Arjan Ali failed to utilise a smart Nabi pass with the Railway FC custodian well out of position, while Bungos snap left-footer sailed a tad too high. The best piece of combination play in the black-and-white ranks came 15 minutes into the second session. Nabi, getting the ball at the end of a Dipendu-Khaled Siddiqui duet, went too wide and hit the side-netting. Nabi was again in good position to head in a rare Amjad Ali Khan cross from right, but it lacked direction and travelled straight to Poddar one bounce. Sheikh Sanjib, coming in for an off-form Dipendu, did worse with a Minz centre  nodding it wide of target. Railway FC displayed more purpose in their build-ups, with Dulal Patra, Gourab Datta and Lakshman Ghosh playing short, accurate passes to threaten the Mohammedan Sporting defence. A free-kick in the 33rd minute had the experienced Bivash Ghosh fumbling badly. The ball, in fact, slipped out of his grasp and Hussain Mustafi had to make a desperate clearance. After change of ends, it was Bivashs turn to avert danger as Patra slipped past Mustafi and Satish Bharti.

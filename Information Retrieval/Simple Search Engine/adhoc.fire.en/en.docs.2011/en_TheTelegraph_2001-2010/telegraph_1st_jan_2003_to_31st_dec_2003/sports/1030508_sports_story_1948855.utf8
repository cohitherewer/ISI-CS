 Kahn mulls move abroad
 Kahn believes he has achieved everything several times over Berlin: Bayern Munichs Oliver Kahn may move abroad for a new challenge, the veteran told sports magazine Bild on Wednesday. Its no secret that I have achieved everything you can several times over with Bayern. Its then that you start to ask yourself how to keep motivating yourself, said the 33-year-old shot-stopper who starred in Germanys run to last years World Cup final. I am in my ninth season (with Bayern) and have put in a huge amount of effort. But when you play abroad you have to prove yourself all over again  and that could open up new possibilities, he explained. Kahns current deal with Bayern runs to 2006 but there would be no shortage of takers for his services. One club reportedly keen on him is Barcelona  although they will not be involved in the Champions League next season  unlike Bayern, with whom Kahn has just wrapped up the Bundesliga title having won the Champions League in 2000 after a dramatic losing final in 1999 against Manchester United. I have had a number of chances to go abroad  and that is currently the case also, explained Kahn who made his name with Dortmund before moving to Bayern in 1994. You have to think carefully  the money is not a priority. Bayern could win the Champions League in the next three seasons. If you move elsewhere you have to think about it. Its a question of the level of your performances. The money cant be the motivation. I can hardly expect to earn more than in Munich, said Kahn who receives an estimated 7.65 million euros a year. Meanwhile, according to a report from London, Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira has reaffirmed his commitment to the Premier League club saying he is looking forward to captaining the team again next season. Quoted in the Arsenal programme for Wednesdays game against Southampton, Vieira said: Im looking forward to sitting down with the boss, reflecting on the season and talking about how we can use the experience to plan a successful 2003-04 season.

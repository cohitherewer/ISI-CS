The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arnold anchors team home
 - A TEAM SERIES-OPENER - Gambhir century, India As 300 go in vain; Zoysa bowls  17-ball over  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Gautam Gambhir, who scored 113, at Eden Gardens on Monday Calcutta: One of the oldest clichs in cricket is that a match isnt over until it is over. India A probably thought its too old to be true, and went down to Sri Lanka A despite scoring 300 in the opening match of the Kenstar tri-series at Eden Gardens on Monday. The hosts threw away a golden opportunity to post a total well beyond what they eventually did which would have killed the match in the first session  they were 204 for one after 35 overs  and appeared complacent while defending the target. Everybody seemed confident that the job would be done but nobody seemed to know who would do it and how. Sri Lanka A captain Russell Arnold played the kind of a knock which had once forced a few to draw a comparison of him with finisher Michael Bevan and remained not out on 96 (99 balls, 8x4, 1x6). First, he played the aggressor in a 126-run third wicket stand with Saman Jayantha and then turned to the anchors role with Naveed Nawaz blazing away during the unbeaten 99-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Jayantha hit a well-paced 92 (98 balls, 11x4, 2x6) but vice-captain Nawaz was more ballistic, exploding at a critical juncture, and hit some exhilarating strokes en route to an unbeaten 57 (44 balls, 4x4, 3x6). A smashing drive through covers with a tremendous swing of the bat and a pulled six on the frontfoot off Munaf Patel were particularly encouraging. The Lankans were home with seven wickets and teo overs to spare. The visitors effort completely overshadowed a professional and authentic 113 (125 balls, 11x4, 1x6) by India A opener Gautam Gambhir and his 159-run second-wicket stand with Mohammed Kaif who made 71 (107 balls, 4x4). The morning didnt show the day. The Lankans made little of good seam bowling conditions following the 8.45 am start and openers Gambhir and Sanjay Bangar took the score to 54 for none by the fifth over. It wasnt as if Adam Gilchrist or Sachin Tendulkar was in full cry, and a bizarre deluge of extras was the principal contributor to the India A tally at that stage. Nuwan Zoysa, who has a Test hattrick to his credit, bowled four no-balls in the first over. He overstepped seven times in his second over and also bowled four wides, which made it a 17-ball over. He conceded 27 runs in that over and was taken off after a first spell of none for 38 in two overs. The left-armer came back courageously from the other end, and gave away 43 in his remaining eight overs, taking two wickets. The flow of extras subsided with the change in bowling but the runs kept coming. After the departure of Bangar in the eighth over, Gambhir kept the scoreboard ticking in the company of Kaif. The latter was quick between wickets as usual and Gambhir showed how accomplished an accumulator of runs he is. The Delhi left-hander wasnt flamboyant and displayed the temperament expected from an opener. He was good while using his feet against spinners and kept working the ball into the gaps instead of blazing away. The Indian innings lost momentum in the closing stages as Sri Lanka A completely blunted their vaunted middle-order.  Man of the Match  Russell Arnold at the Eden. Pictures by Santosh GhoshIt was a difficult time to bat. Everybody was expected to score at a rapid pace soon after coming in, and it was one of those days when none of them clicked. A late charge by Dinesh Mongia took India A to 300, which was looking unlikely two-three overs earlier. The real disappointment came after the break. Amit Bhandari, who beat the bat regularly in his opening spell, and Bangar kept things in check and the home team seemed to be cruising as the visitors reached 48 for one after ten overs. But Jayantha turned the tide at this stage after No. 3 Jehan Mubarrak smashed a 16-ball 25 including four successive fours in Patels second over. Arnold came in after Mubarraks departure and the runs kept coming with some neat placements and quick singles on either side of the wicket. Patel grassed a simple chance with Jayantha on 58 and Arnold benefited from an edge through the wicketkeeper and the slip when he had just two. They made most of these let-offs. A Lankan victory was always a possibility once they reached 175 for two in the 30th over and the fact that the Indians failed to break through proved decisive.  Copyright

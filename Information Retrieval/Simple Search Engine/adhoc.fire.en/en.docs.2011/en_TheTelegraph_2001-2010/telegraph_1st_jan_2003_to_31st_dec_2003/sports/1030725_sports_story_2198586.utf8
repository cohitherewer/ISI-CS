 India deserve current status: ICC
London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday defended its one-day rankings system as objective, fair and fact-based, and said India fully deserved its current lowly status. The ICCs One-Day International rating system has come in for criticism after India, beaten finalists in this years World Cup, dropped from fifth to eighth in the latest rankings released last week. That prompted Indian captain Sourav Ganguly to claim that the system defied logic. But ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed defended the method of calculation, which means success in a single tournament, even the World Cup, is not sufficient to make up for poor form in the preceding two years. The ICC ODI ratings assess the performances of a team over two years, not over two months, Speed said. For example, Indias unchanged rating reflects the fact that while it enjoyed some success in key tournaments, it has also performed quite poorly at other times against teams that were ranked below it in the table. The updated ratings table published last week indicates that there is little to separate the middle-ranking teams in world cricket. On the field, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and West Indies are evenly matched and with only three points separating these teams, the table reflects just how close these sides are to each other. David Kendix, the man who devised the ICC system, pointed out that Indias current ranking includes series losses to West Indies and New Zealand as well as the success in South Africa. Indias success at the World Cup does not alter history, he said. Given its inconsistent performances against teams that were rated below it in the table, it should be of no surprise that India has been unable to improve its rating.  (AFP)  Copyright

 3 GMs in joint lead 
Kozhikode, Dec. 6 (PTI): Grandmasters Surya Sekhar Ganguly, R. B. Ramesh and Koneru Humpy emerged joint leaders with four points apiece recording hard fought victories in the fifth round of the 41st national A chess championship. GM Dibyendu Barua of Bengal stands on sole fourth spot with 3.5 points after he was surprised by the solid play of Manipuri S. Vikramjit Singh remained on a respectable 50 per cent score. The day belonged to countrys latest GM Ramesh who scored the maximum points on the third day. He showed steely nerves to get the better of IM Prathamesh Mokal to move into joint lead. Ganguly was at his attacking best as he beat his statemate IM Roktim Bandhopadhyay in the fifth round.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Win puts Arsenal on top of table
 - PREMIER LEAGUE - Roy Keane strike takes United past Leeds  Manchester Uniteds Darren Fletcher (left) in a tussle with Leeds Uniteds Seth Johnson in Leeds on Saturday London, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Arsenal went top of the Premier League on Saturday after a goalkeeping howler by Carlo Cudicini gifted them a 2-1 derby victory over Chelsea. Thierry Henry bundled home the 75th minute winner after Cudicinis nightmare fumble to leave Arsenal top on 23 points, one clear of champions Manchester United, who had earlier snatched a 1-0 victory at Leeds United. Chelseas expensively-assembled side, who had cancelled out Edus opener for Arsenal with a stunning strike by Argentine Hernan Crespo, are third on 20 points after their first defeat of the season. Manchester City thrashed Bolton Wanderers 6-2, former Liverpool midfielder Patrik Berger scored Portsmouths winner against his old club in a 1-0 victory and Newcastle United beat Middlesbrough 1-0 in the northeast derby. In an early match, captain Roy Keane headed a late winner for champions Manchester United to snatch a 1-0 win. Leeds, 16th in the table, raised their game and looked set for a deserved draw when Keane rose at the far post to head home a superb cross from the right by Gary Neville. Uniteds Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy missed chances in both halves while Paul Scholes should have made it 2-0 in stoppage time, hitting the bar from point-blank range. It was a frustrating day for us really and that was down to the way Leeds performed and they were very good tactically, United manager Alex Ferguson said. You may look at it and say they deserved more but we had a major share of the game, we made the chances that mattered and I dont think we were undeserved winners. But it was a very hard game for us. Leeds boss Peter Reid, whose side harried United in midfield and interrupted their forwards supply line from playmaker Scholes, said: The gameplan nearly worked. But thats why Manchester United are where they are. Theyre such a good side, with so many good players  they sniff a chance out and get a goal.  Copyright

 CMs get well soon letter for Leander
 - Next MRI to be done on September 18  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Leander will call to thank the CM Calcutta: Leander Paes has already thanked a billion Indians who stood by him during a tense week when doctors at Orlandos M.D. Anderson Cancer Center were trying their best to diagnose the four-mm brain lesion. He will soon be calling another well-wisher to express his gratitude  a VIP who answers to the name of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The chief minister faxed a letter to the tennis star on Monday evening, urging him to get well soon. I wish you a speedy recovery. I hope you will soon return to the tennis court and continue to win many more laurels for our country, was the CMs message. The letter is dated August 29, but got delayed as a fax number wasnt available. We are very touched by the CMs letter Leander will personally call and thank him, said Dr Vece Paes. Leander is presently recuperating at his Orlando apartment, having been discharged from the hospital on Saturday evening. The medication will continue for about two more weeks. An MRI will be done on September 18 to see whether the cyst has shrunk. That report will give a good idea of his recovery, Dr Paes explained. Paes senior, who has been with his son for 10 days, is scheduled to leave Orlando next Monday, by which time Julie will be there. The idea is to have someone from the family with him as long as possible, said the Doc. Leanders girlfriend Mahima Chaudhary has left for Mumbai but is expected to be back with him around September 20.  Bopanna back on top Meanwhile, Rohan Bopanna has regained his status as the India No. 1 after winning the Indonesia Futures title on Sunday. The big-serving man from Coorg had been displaced from that position for three weeks by Prakash Amritraj. Bopanna, who earned 18 points from his title-clinching effort, will take his points tally to 106 and move up from 342 to around 305 when the next entry ranking system list is issued next Monday. Prakash will remain at No. 320 with 97 points. The comparative numbers are significant especially in context of the Davis Cup World Group play-off tie in The Netherlands later this month. Bopanna and Amritraj are expected to be the two singles players, with the top-ranked man taking on the Dutch No. 2 on the opening day and vice-versa.  Copyright

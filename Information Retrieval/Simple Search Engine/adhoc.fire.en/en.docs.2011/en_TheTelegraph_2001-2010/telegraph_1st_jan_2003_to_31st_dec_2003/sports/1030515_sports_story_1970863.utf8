The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Carlton Baugh Jr. for Jacobs 
St Johns: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has made one change to the 15-man squad for the one-day series with Australia. Ridley Jacobs has been replaced by wicketkeeper-batsman Carlton Baugh Jr. for the best of seven series starting in Jamaica on Saturday . Selectors chairman Viv Richards said Jacobs was being given more time to fully recover from the groin injury that kept him out of two matches in the Test series which ended on Tuesday in a 3-1 win for the visitors. However, paceman Jermaine Lawson, whose action has been brought under scanner following reports by the umpires for the final Test, has been retained.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

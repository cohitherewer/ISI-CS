 Mhambrey calls it quits
Mumbai, May 31 (PTI): Former India paceman Paras Mhambrey, who led Mumbai to their Ranji Trophy triumph in the 2002-03 season, announced his retirement from first-class cricket Saturday. Mhambrey, who played two Tests and two one-dayers against England in an away series in 1996, said he wanted to concentrate more on coaching. I know I could have played for Mumbai for another couple of years, but as there are quite a few young fast bowlers waiting in the wings, I decided to make way, he said. I have sent a letter to Mumbai Cricket Association requesting them not to consider me any longer. I was also lucky to be offered the coachs job of the Mumbai U-25 squad for the coming season, Mhambrey said. Mhambrey has played 60 Ranji Trophy matches, taking 208 wickets and scoring 1174 runs.

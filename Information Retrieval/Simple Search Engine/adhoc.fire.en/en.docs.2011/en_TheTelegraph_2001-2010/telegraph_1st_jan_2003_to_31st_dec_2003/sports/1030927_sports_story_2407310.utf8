 Blignaut ready to test Aussies 
 Andy Blignaut feels Australian pitches suit his style Perth: Zimbabwe fast bowler Andy Blignaut has got his hunger back  and is now looking to feast on Australias batting order. Blignaut, 25, went into a self-imposed 14-month exile from cricket until a year ago after a furious spat with Zimbabwes cricketing authorities. But with the dispute firmly consigned to history, Blignaut is now relishing the prospect of Zimbabwes first Test against the world champions in Australia. I had a bit of a problem with some of the administrative people, and people around me  and I was not then really focused on the game at that point, so I thought it was better just to step back for a while, he explained on Friday. That is well behind me now, and I am itching to bowl at the Australian batsmen, he said after a training session with teammates ahead of next months two Tests against the world champions. I have recaptured the hunger. Blignaut has already made a promising comeback after his stay away from the game, showing good touch as an allrounder in the World Cup and in a Test series in England earlier this year. I think that Australian pitches could be quite good for my type of bowling, said the right-armer, whose first 10 Tests have yielded 34 wickets at an average of 32.73. Australian pitches are bouncier, and I certainly like that. But bowling really goes to basics. You have to keep the ball in the right area and give yourself the best chance. The Australian top-order is very strong, but if you get the ball on the spot it takes the ball to move only about two inches and your luck can be in. Blignaut will open the bowling with skipper Heath Streak.  (AFP)  Copyright

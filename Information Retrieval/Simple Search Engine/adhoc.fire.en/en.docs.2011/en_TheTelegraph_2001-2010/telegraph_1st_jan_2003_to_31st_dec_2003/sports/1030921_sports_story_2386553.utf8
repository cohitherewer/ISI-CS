The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. miss many, net 2
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Barasat, Sept. 20: In an exhibition of missed chances at the Barasat Stadium, Mohammedan Sporting managed a 2-0 win over West Bengal Police in an IFA Shield match on Saturday. The result put Mohammedan Sporting atop group D and a draw against Ever-Ready on Monday will take them to the semi-finals. Dipendu Biswas and Peter Nwoji were the scorers. The goals were hardly the talking point, those not scored were. Dipendu, Syed Rahim Nabi, Nwoji and substitute Abdul Rauf Khan all failed to do the needful with just the keeper to beat. TEAMS Md. Sporting: Amar Deb; Amjad Ali Khan, Hussain Mustafi, Habib Adenkule, Madhab Das, Amandeep Singh; Bungo Singh (Khalid Siddiqui, 64), Shahnawaz Iqbal Khan, Syed Rahim Nabi; Dipendu Biswas, Peter Nwoji (Abdul Rauf Khan, 65).

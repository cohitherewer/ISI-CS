 Henry wins it for France again
 - Confederations cup l Marc-Vivien  Foes widow attends emotionally-charged final French captain Marcel  Desailly holds aloft the Confederations Cup, surrounded  by players from both teams in Saint Denis. France greeted  Sundays triumph with a mixture of humility and subdued  satisfaction, dedicating the night to the late Marc-Vivien  Foe. (Reuters)  Paris: France retained  the Confederations Cup on Sunday when an extra-time golden  goal by Thierry Henry gave the hosts a 1-0 win over Cameroon  in a match dedicated to the memory of Marc-Vivien Foe.  The Cameroon midfielder had collapsed  during Thursdays semi-final win over Colombia in Lyon and  died shortly afterwards. France captain Marcel Desailly  insisted on lifting the trophy jointly with Cameroon skipper  Rigobert Song in a gesture that summed up a remarkable evening. Both sides then came together  for a lap of honour, carrying a lifesize photograph of Foe  as the players name rang around the stadium. France coach Jacques Santini said:  This final feels somehow unfinished because of the circumstances  it was played in. A family has lost a member and someone  who was dear to us has gone forever. We had to learn how  to win with several key players missing, he added, referring  to Zinedine Zidane. His opposite number, Winfried Schafer,  said it was absolutely right to play the final. It was  the wish of the team, Marc-Viviens wife and me to play  tonight, said the German coach. For the Indomitable Lions, both  the match and the tournament paled into insignificance after  the loss of Foe. His wife Marie-Louise sat next to Fifa  president Sepp Blatter at the game, with Pele and Roger  Milla just behind. The Cameroon players donned green  shirts with Foes name and No. 17 stamped on the back while  the 52,000 crowd at the Stade de France chanted Foes name  and applauded. The evenly-contested match was played in  an atmosphere of mutual respect and there were few scoring  chances in the first 90 minutes. Henrys scrambled winner  the  first goal Cameroon conceded in the tournament  also made  the outstanding Arsenal striker its top scorer with four  goals. When the match started, Frances  first chance was predictably conjured up by Henry, when  he neatly shot the ball across the face of the Cameroon  goal, but Djibril Cisses stooping header turned it wide  of the far post. Henry, who was also voted player of the  tournament, followed up with a smart turn and shot which  keeper Idris Kameni smothered as France built on their  promising start. However, Cameroon settled into their rhythm  and only an acrobatic save from Fabien Barthez prevented  Pius Ndiefi flicking them into the lead. Cameroon, the reigning African  champions, kept pushing forward and the hosts had a narrow  escape when substitute Samuel Etoo nearly signalled his  remarkable arrival with a goal from his first touch of the  ball. Etoo arrived in Paris from Spain  after scoring twice for Real Mallorca in a 3-0 Kings Cup  final win over Recreativo Huelva late on Saturday. The game  was settled seven minutes into the extra period when substitute  Lilian Thuram sent a probing ball into the box and Henry  used his knee to nudge it past Kameni into the net.  Scrap No. 17: Song Song feels that Cameroons No.  17 shirt should be withdrawn after the death of Foe, the  last man to wear it. The Cameroon skipper said: Its  not my decision but I think the No. 17 shirt should no longer  be a part of the national team. It ought to remain with  Marcos memory because he always wore it, ever since he  joined the national team. Honestly, I think its something  we have to do. Both Foes former French clubs, Olympique  Lyon and RC Lens, have said they would be withdrawing their  No. 17 shirts, which he also wore when representing them. (AGENCIES) Copyright

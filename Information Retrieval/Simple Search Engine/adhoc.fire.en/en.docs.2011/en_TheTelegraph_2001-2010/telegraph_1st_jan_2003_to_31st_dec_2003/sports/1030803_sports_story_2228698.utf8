 Jeev slips to tied 60th place
New Delhi, Aug. 2 (PTI): Indias Jeev Milkha Singh on Saturday shot a five-over 77 to slip to tied-60th at the 120 million Aiful Cup, being played Ishikawa, Japan. According to information received here, Jeev slipped down the leaderboard with an aggregate two-under 314 after a bogey-splattered third round Saturday. Jeev began his round with a bogey and went on to drop shots on the fourth, sixth and seventh to make the turn at four-over. A birdie on the tenth raised hopes of a revival but bogeys on the 16th and 18th worsened his position.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Teams show depresses Bhowmick 
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: Subhas Bhowmick looked visibly depressed after his teams 3-2 win over Indian Bank, but the East Bengal coach tried to mask his disappointment by stating that the win, not the victory margin, mattered in the end. We won by one goal but could have won by three more had we converted all our chances, Bhowmick said after the match on Tuesday. Bhowmick felt that ace striker Mike Okoro was still not in good nick. He wasted two sitters, one in each half, which he normally converts with ease, the coach said of the striker. Bhowmick also came down on the match officials for bad supervision. The second goal scored against us was visibly a foul. The Indian Banks right-back pulled and tugged at Subhas Chakrabortys shirt. This action took place in front of the assistant referee (S.M. Balu of Karnataka, who had supervised in the Afro-Asian Games in Hyderabad) and the referee (Manuel Pereira), yet they waved play on. It was unbelievable and poor supervision, Bhowmick quipped. Taking a pot shot at his defence, he described the way his backline conceded the first goal as silly. When asked about East Bengals wayward form, Bhowmick added that my team is missing our central midfielders  Douglas Da Silva (injured), Chandan Das and Tushar Rakshit (office commitments). I tried out Sankar Lal Chakraborty today but he was not match fit. Nabi doubtful Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sporting striker Rahim is a doubtful starter against his teams key match against Salgaocar FC. Mohammedan Sporting need to beat the Goan outfit in their crucial Group C quarter final league match on Wednesday to stay in contention. A win will help the Calcutta team move into semi-finals. Nabi is recovering from fever. However, international defender Satish Bhartis return will strengthen the back four. On a slippery surface at the Salt Lake Stadium in August, Mohammedan Sporting had trounced Salgaocar 5-0. However, Salgaocar will be a hard nut to crack on the hard surface here. Mohammedan Sporting welcomed the All India Football Federation president Priya Ranjan Das Munshis initiative to get the club a sponsor. Both Mohammedan Sporting and Churchill Brothers, Goa will be sponsored by Coca Cola for the forthcoming National Football League slated to start from Nov. 21. On the other hand, the JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh said his team may wear black armbands against Mahindra United on Wednesday as a mark of respect for former Indian junior goalkeeper Ravi Kumar (played for Leaders Club and JCT), who died in penury on Tuesday.

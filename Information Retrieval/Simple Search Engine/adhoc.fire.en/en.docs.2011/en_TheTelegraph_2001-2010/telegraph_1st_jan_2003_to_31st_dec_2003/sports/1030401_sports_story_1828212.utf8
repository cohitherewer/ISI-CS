The Telegraph - Calcutta
 UCB seeks govt nod
 - BCCI confirms Sachin, Dravid unavailability BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Sourav: Dhaka-bound,  as of now  Calcutta: Even as the United  Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) has sought a fresh  advisory from Pretoria on visiting Bangladesh, the Board  of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has confirmed Sachin  Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid arent available for the April  11-20 tri-series (TVS Cup) there. We have moved for a fresh advisory,  from the government, on whether it will be okay to tour  Bangladesh We expect to hear in a couple of days and, only  then, will a statement be issued, informed UCBSA spokesperson  Bronwyn Wilkinson, when contacted in Johannesburg, Monday  afternoon. Besides that tournament, South  Africa are to play two Tests  in Chittagong and Dhaka,  from April 24-May 5. Events in Iraq, which made South Africa  withdraw from the Sharjah Cup (beginning Thursday), have  forced a question mark over the Bangladesh visit. The Bangladesh Cricket Board,  though, is drawing up contingency plans and the tri-series  (at least) will go ahead even if South Africa pulls out.  Apparently, Zimbabwe and Kenya have been sounded out. Exposure-starved Kenya, it may  be recalled, took South Africas place in the Sharjah Cup,  while Zimbabwe became the fourth team in what was intended  to be a triangular tournament.  Meanwhile, as reported in these  columns on March 22 itself, Team India will be without some  of the biggest names. Indeed, BCCI secretary S.K.Nair has  confirmed Sachin and vice-captain Dravid, both of whom have  finger injuries, arent available. Then, Ashish Nehra is to undergo  ankle surgery, while Anil Kumble too may decide to give  the ill-timed tri-series a skip. As for Jawagal Srinath,  he is keeping everybody guessing. Significantly, captain Sourav  Ganguly isnt fully fit either. As of now, however, Im  going, he told The Telegraph late Monday. The squad will be picked in Mumbai  Wednesday, on the morning after Sahara India Pariwars star-spangled  deluxe apartments-presentation ceremony at Amby Valley. The World Cup XV apart, the beneficiaries  are: Coach John Wright, physio Andrew Leipus and physical  trainer Adrian le Roux. Its nice, of course, that the support  staff is also getting rewarded.

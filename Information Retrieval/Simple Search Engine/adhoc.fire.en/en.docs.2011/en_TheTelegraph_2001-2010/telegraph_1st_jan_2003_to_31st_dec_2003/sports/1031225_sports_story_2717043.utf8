 Mystery bug lands Slater in hospital
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Slater is confined to a wheelchair  Melbourne: The dashing Michael Slater, whose  decline began in the 2000-2001 series in India, is today  confined to a wheelchair. The opener is in a Sydney hospital,  struggling to stave off the degenerative effects of a  mystery bug. He cannot walk unaided and his right leg is  in a cast.  According to reports, Slater was hospitalised around  a fortnight ago when he showed symptoms of an acute arthritis-type  ailment. Apparently, he would always be troubled by some  form of arthritis. Its another matter that it never quite  affected his flamboyant batting.  For now, nobody is quite sure  when (a) Slater will be discharged and (b) how soon will  he return to first-class cricket with New South Wales. Efforts  by The Telegraph to contact him, on Wednesday, proved  futile.  Copyright

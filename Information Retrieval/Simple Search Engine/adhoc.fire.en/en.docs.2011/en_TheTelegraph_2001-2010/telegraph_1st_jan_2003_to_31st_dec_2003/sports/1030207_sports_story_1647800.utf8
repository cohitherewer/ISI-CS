The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kasparov escapes with draw
New York: Garri Kasparov, the worlds top- rated chess player, and computer opponent Deep Junior tied the fifth game of their Man vs Machine series, playing just 19 moves. The six-game series remains tied at two-games apiece. The final game of the match  which could end in a draw  is set for Friday. In the tenth move of the game Wednesday, the Israeli- programmed Deep Junior sacrificed, or exposed, its bishop to Kasparovs king to draw the piece into a vulnerable position. The king was then repeatedly attacked by Deep Juniors knight, keeping it in check. The repetition of moves forced a draw in nine more moves. I didnt feel comfortable at all, Kasparov said. Experts watching the game said Kasparov was forced into a no-way-out situation and none of his other pieces could help him. In order to defend, Kasparov had to go through quite a few confrontations, said John Fernandes, a chess consultant for x3d Technologies. If there was a win, its very, very difficult to find.

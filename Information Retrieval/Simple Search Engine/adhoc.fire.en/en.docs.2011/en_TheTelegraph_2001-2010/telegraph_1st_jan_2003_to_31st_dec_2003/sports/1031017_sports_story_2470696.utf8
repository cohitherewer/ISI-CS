 Bopanna, Mankad crash out
Belgaum: Rohan Bopanna and Harsh Mankad bowed out of the Belgaum ATP Challenger meet on Thursday, ending Indias campaign in singles. Mustafa Ghouse and Vishal Uppal, however, moved into the doubles title-round beating fellow-Indians Vishal Punna and Sunil Kumar Sipaeya 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. Bopanna was involved in a dogfight with Teimuraz Gabashvili only to come out on the wrong end of the scoreline. He fought for a two-and-a-half-hours, but the unseeded Russian won the battle of wits 6-7 (8-10), 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Mankad, by comparison, was quite subdued against Stephane Bohli. The unseeded Swiss was in control from the very start and the Indian Davis Cupper bowed 4-6, 3-6. Top seed Danai Udomchoke of Thailand made his exit too. He retired citing an injury when Russian Yuri Schukin was leading 7-5, 3-2. Seventh seed Vadim Kutsenko of Uzbekistan reached the quarter finals. He defeated Japanese Toshihide Matsui 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Schukin will meet Gabashvili, while Kutsenko will clash with German Dieter Kindlmann, who whipped Ti Chen of Chinese Taipei 6-2, 6-1. Russias Dmitry Vlasov defeated Britains Lee Childs 7-6 (7-3), 6-2 to set up a date with fourth-seeded South African Rik de Voest. The other quarter final will feature Bohli and Slovakias Branislav Sekac, who beat German Marcello Craca 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-2.  (PTI)  Copyright

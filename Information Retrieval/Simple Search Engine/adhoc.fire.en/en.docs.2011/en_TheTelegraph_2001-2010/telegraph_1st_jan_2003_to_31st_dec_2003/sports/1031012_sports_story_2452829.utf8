The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stick to the new guy in opening slot
 - Souravs aggression and spontaneity has helped the team: Aunshuman Gaekwad  FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR  Gaekwad feels youngsters  success is Indias success  Sourav's efficiency  has won plauditsAhmedabad, Oct. 11: Aunshuman Gaekwad is not known to mince words. The former India opener and coach is in charge of Gujarat for the forthcoming Ranji season. However, he did take time off to be with the players here. He spoke to The Telegraph during the course of the Test match.  The following are excerpts On the need for specialists  in the team Opening and wicketkeeping are specialised jobs and  we should have them. Makeshift openers dont last long,  though, there are exceptions.  On why India are struggling  with openers Weve have been struggling with openers for almost  two decades now. Only when Sunil (Gavaskar), Chetan (Chauhan)  and myself were around was there some stability. Otherwise,  its been a history with Indian cricket that anyone who  plays well in the middle-order is pushed up as makeshift  opener. Sadly, because he is performing consistently. Thats  not what should be done. By doing so youre toying with  a players career and at the same time also having a slot  open.  On if there is a dearth  of openers in the country  There is no dearth of openers in the country. We have  openers in Shiv Sundar Das, Sanjay Bangar, Vinayak Mane.  Now you have Akash Chopra doing well. These are boys you  need to persist with. You just cant keep chopping and changing  all the time. Remember, you have very limited options. If  you feel X guy has talent, give him a chance and the assurance.  Once he gets the confidence he has to come good because  he possesses the potential. This is an area we need to work  upon.  On whether Sanjay Bangar  should have been in the team for the first Test versus New  Zealand He should have stayed on. He always gives you the  option of an additional seamer. As an opener, he is well  equipped to handle fast bowling.  On Virender Sehwags wish  to bat down the order  Test cricket is serious business. You need to stay  at the crease and work for your runs. Its a test of patience  and temperament. You are not looking at a quick-blast 50  or a 100. He is the sort who likes to play his shots and  so he must be thinking of coming down the order.  On the need for a specialist  wicketkeeper in one-dayers  Rahul Dravid has done a wonderful job for the sake  of the team. But the additional responsibility is very harsh  on him. Lets not forget he is one of our mainstay batsmen.  Wicketkeeping is a specialised job and we should adhere  to it.  On how he assesses Parthiv  Patel  Parthiv has done very well for his age. He has shown  lot of maturity. They have to really nurse him. Here is  a boy who will stay for long. He has proved his potential  and mental toughness.  On the team managements  views that he hasnt scored enough runs Doesnt matter if he hasnt got the runs. Do you expect  your No. 9 batsman to score a century? Youve got your top-order  batsmen to do the job. Today, most wicketkeepers are also  good batsmen. Give Parthiv some time, hell also contribute.  On the secret behind Indias  recent success  Definitely the success of the youngsters. Sehwag,  Kaif, Yuvraj and Zaheer have made a big difference to the  side. Batting, bowling and fielding-wise they have been  a huge help. The balance in the team has improved which  means a lot.  On Sourav Gangulys captaincy  He has matured, knows his job well and is handling  responsibility with efficiency. Aggressive, he has always  been, and he has been spontaneous on certain issues even  on the field and imposed it on the other players. Thats  augurs well for the team.  On whether there has been  a change in attitude in the current side You cant really make out from outside whether attitude  has changed or not. Only when you are with the boys all  the time can you judge that. But they have been doing well  and what ultimately counts is the result.  Finally, on John Wrights  contribution (After a pause) This is something somebody  else has to judge. It will not be right for me to comment  anything.  Copyright

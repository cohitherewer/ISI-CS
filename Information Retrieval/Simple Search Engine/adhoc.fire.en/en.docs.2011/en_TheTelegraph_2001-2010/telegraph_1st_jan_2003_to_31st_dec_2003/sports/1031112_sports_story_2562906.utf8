The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, November 12, 2003  Classic fillies score with aplomb 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 Evangeline				 										Winning their trials in impressive manner, and thus confirming their improvement and superior class, Evangeline and Brighter Future were the only two fillies from among others to score full marks last Friday, the opening day of the cold weather season 2003-4. They had also done very well during the monsoon season and had given enough indications about their classics prospects but winter track being a different ball game, one looked forward with keen interest if they carried their form to the big season.				 										The victory of the two could be summed up in a sentence that they left the field cold in their respective events. Evangeline, a Bharath Singh -trainee was, however, up against a formidable Class II opposition in the 1,400m Gavin Johnston Cup. But again, Brighter Future from Daniel Davids yard was thrown against some hot-footed Class III horses over an 1,100m scurry. Yet, the Duja-Belle Epoque daughter never allowed any of her 11 opponents to break away from the field. She was happily settled behind Common Spirit till the final turn before working her way up to shoot in to the lead 300m from the winning post.				 										What remains to be seen now as to how much she has improved compared to Evangeline, a Excaliburs Lake-Glowing Tribute filly, who had handed Brighter Future 6-1/2 kg and a shade under nine-length beating in the monsoons Fillies Stakes three months ago.				 										 The one who failed badly, albeit against a slow improving colt Gypsy King, was the Vijay Singhs 1000 Guineas hope Arikara in the Starry Flag Cup. She was no match for the Bharath-colt who simply drew away from the field once the Steinbeck-Cico Park was put on top gear. However, Vijay has enough in the stock to surprise the best even if he decides to send his challengers without a race gallop.				 										The season witnessed a frightful start with lesser fancied Simply Monarch and Alborada winning their respective events before Bharath started his winning run to end the day with a treble. Frontier Flame opened the account for the shrewd trainer before Evangeline and Gypsy King completed his tally of three winners. Incidentally, Both Evangeline and Gypsy King were partnered by the visiting jockey M. Poirier.

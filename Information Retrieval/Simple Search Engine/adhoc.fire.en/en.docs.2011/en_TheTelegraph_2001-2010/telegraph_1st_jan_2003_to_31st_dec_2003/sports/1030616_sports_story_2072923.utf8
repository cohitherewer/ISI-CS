The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Manipur register win
Chennai: Defending champions Manipur edged past Karnataka 1-0, while last years finalists Orissa were held to a goalless draw by Goa in the quarter final league of the 11th national womens football championship here on Sunday. Karnataka adopted an ultra-defensive strategy, by crowding their zone with seven players. Fancied Manipur strikers, thus, had a difficult time to break the opponents rearguard. However, the Karnataka citadel finally fell to constant Manipur sorties in the 71st minute, when Phajabi Devi drove home a pass from Manitombi Devi. In Group B, a technically sound Orissa looked all set to win, with forwards Sudipta Das, Aruna Dibyadarshini and Pinky Bampal Magar in full form. However, the Goan defence managed to withstand the attacks. (PTI)  Copyright

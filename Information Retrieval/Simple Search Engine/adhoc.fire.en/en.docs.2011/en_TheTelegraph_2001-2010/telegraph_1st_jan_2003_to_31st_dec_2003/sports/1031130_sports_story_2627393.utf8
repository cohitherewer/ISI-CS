 Rivaldo to leave Milan
Milan, Nov. 29 (Reuters): Brazilian World Cup winner Rivaldo is to leave European champions AC Milan, the Italian clubs vice-president said on Saturday. It is with great sadness that I have to say that Rivaldo will leave Milan within a few days, Adriano Galliani told Radio Spazio Aperto. Milan agreed to release Rivaldo from his contract in September but then both the player and club had a change of heart and he decided to carry on. However, the Brazilian has been unable to secure regular first team football and will now be able to look for a new club and move when the transfer window re-opens in January. He has been unable to find a place in the team and so without doubt he will play for another club from January, said Galliani.  Copyright

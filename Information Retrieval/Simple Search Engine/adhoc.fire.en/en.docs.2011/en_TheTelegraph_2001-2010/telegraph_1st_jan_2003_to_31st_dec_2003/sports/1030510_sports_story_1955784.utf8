 Pargat for resumption 
Jalandhar: Former Indian hockey captain Pargat Singh on Friday made an impassioned plea for resumption of hockey ties with Pakistan saying it was just what was needed for giving the game a fillip in the sub-continent. Urging the Indian Hockey Federation to take up the issue with the government, Pargat said that hockey had suffered a lot in the sub-continent due to adverse relations between the two neighbouring countries but the time was now ripe to break the ice. India last played a Test series with Pakistan in 1998. In fact, artistic hockey is only being played in these two countries and it is need of the hour to save artistic hockey by resumption of bilateral ties, he said. While agreeing with sports minister Vikram Verma that resumption of sporting ties was subject to progress on diplomatic and political fronts, Pargat said we really miss watching them battling on the fields.

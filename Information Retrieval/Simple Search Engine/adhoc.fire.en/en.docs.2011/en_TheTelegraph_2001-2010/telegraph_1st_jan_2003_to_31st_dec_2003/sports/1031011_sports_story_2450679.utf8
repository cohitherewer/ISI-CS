The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Phenomenal: Steve
 - One can't plan such a innings, feels Sachin
The following were the several reactions to Matthew Haydens tremendous world record-beating achievement against Zimbabwe Friday.  Steve Waugh: It was a phenomenal performance  concentration-wise, combined with technical brilliance;  the cleanest ball-striking I have ever seen. Thoroughly  deserved.  Ricky Ponting: It was an amazing performance,  and one that I will never forget. It is a credit to Matt  who has just worked so hard and I am thrilled for him.  Mark Taylor: I dont think you can diminish  any innings like that. All right, a Test match hundred against  Zimbabwe is probably not as good as a Test match hundred  against say the West Indies in their hallowed days of the  80s. But to go on and make a score of 380, to do that takes  special concentration and takes fitness. I always knew Matthew  Hayden had that. I really got nervous for him in the 290s.  It gave me a little bit of reflection back about five years  ago when I was lucky enough to get to that total. When I  got to 300 it was all a blur.  Bill Brown (member of Bradmans 1948 Ashes-winning  Invincibles side): He (Hayden) scored quickly and technically.  The innings was superb. Remarkable. I think Don, if he was  here, would have appreciated the fact that records are made  to be broken.   Geoff Marsh: It was a truly magnificent knock.  Our blokes did not bowl badly. It was one of the best innings  I have ever seen. In years to come, our players will know  that there was an awesome player out there who took us to  the cleaners. He just bullies you  thats what he did today. [Not many players involved in the third day of the India-New Zealand first Test were able to watch Haydens great feat, but a few did give their views to The Telegraph, some exclusively]  Sachin Tendulkar: No one can plan such a knock.  It just happens.  Sourav Ganguly: I can only say its a stupendous  achievement. Hes been a class act.  Rahul Dravid: Not fair to say anything since  I havent watched him. I only hope he doesnt get as many  runs against us.  V.V.S. Laxman: He has been consistent and is  used to huge knocks and big innings. So it could have happened  any day.  Anil Kumble: Hayden obviously is a great player  and his record speaks for himself.  Nathan Astle: A lot of runs... One hell of  an effort.

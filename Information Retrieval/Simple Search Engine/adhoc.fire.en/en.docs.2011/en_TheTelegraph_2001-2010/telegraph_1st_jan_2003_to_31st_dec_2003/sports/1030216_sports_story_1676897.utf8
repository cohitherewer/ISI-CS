The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ACB not to press case till B report
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Warne: Shouldnt have been so callous Centurion: The Australians have sought the Event Technical Committees (ETCs) permission to replace Shane Warne in the World Cup XV but, even if clearance is given, they wont act till the B sample report is available. The initial move has been made, but nothing more will be done till that second (B sample) report is ready. In any case, we are assuming the ETC will approve a replacement, a source told The Telegraph Saturday. In fact, the Australian Cricket Boards (ACBs) anti-doping committee will only meet once the B sample report is available. That should be with the ACB by early next week, the source added. Apparently, not just the ACB brass, even Warnes teammates are furious that he disregarded established policy by resorting to medication without consulting either the provincial or the ACBs own panel of doctors. That a pro like him can be so callous is simply unthinkable, the source remarked, pointing out that all first-class cricketers are thoroughly briefed about the anti-doping policy (and other issues) before the start of every season. Warne, it may be recalled, took diuretics  one of five substances specifically banned by the ACB  on his mothers advice. The other banned substances are: Stimulants, narcotics, anabolic agents plus peptide hormones, mimetics and their analogues. Incidentally, the prohibited methods are blood doping plus pharmacological, chemical and physical manipulation. Ponting hopeful Meanwhile, captain Ricky Ponting is hopeful that Warne will be able to rejoin the squad. He said as much during a Media conference after Saturdays match.  Copyright

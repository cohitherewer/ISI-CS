 ZCU says team not politically cleansed
London: Zimbabwe Cricket Union Monday strongly refuted claims that its team currently touring England was politically cleansed and said such charges were insulting and inaccurate. It is both insulting and inaccurate to suggest that this Zimbabwe squad has been politically vetted as has been suggested throughout the tour by protest groups, ZCU chairman Peter Chingoka said in a statement. The ZCU would prefer not to dignify these unpleasant claims with a public response of this nature. But as the same misinformation continues to be circulated it is important to set the record straight  for the benefit of the team and the many thousands of fans who have followed this tour as genuine cricket lovers, he said. ZCU selectors were solely responsible for the make-up of this squad. It was chosen without political intervention. The only player not in the squad who we believe would have merited inclusion is Andy Flower  a world class performer, Chingoka said.  (PTI)  Copyright

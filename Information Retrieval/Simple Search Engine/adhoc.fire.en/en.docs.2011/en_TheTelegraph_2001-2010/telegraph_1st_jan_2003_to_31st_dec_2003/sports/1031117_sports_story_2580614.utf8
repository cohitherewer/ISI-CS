The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I dont focus on what others expect of me... I focus on my own expectations 
 - I would like another opportunity in Test cricket as Im a better player now, says Michael Bevan  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI For years, Michael Bevan admired Ian and Greg Chappell. In recent times, he has himself earned a huge following which cuts across boundaries. In fact, the limited overs game hasnt seen a better finisher  its more than reflected in his average (55.41 in 219 matches, 6,594 runs). But no matter how busy Bevan is while batting, he has that unhurried demeanour off the field. Bevan, who made his debut in 1993-94, spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday evening. The following are excerpts Q Every team would give anything to have you in the one-day XI... A (Grins) Well, I probably make a difference batting down the order... Ive got a role to fulfil... Ive got a fair idea of what gives me the best chance of trying to help the team win... But, has this one-day-cricketer-only label affected you? Did affect me five-six years ago, but Im over that now. People are always going to have an opinion but, then, I value my own opinion the most. Really, personally, I dont see myself as just a limited overs cricketer. That, for me, is important. Whats the thought-process like when Michael Bevan takes strike? I make a decision and stay true... Basically, its a question of working out what you do well and what you dont. That done, youve got to be consistent  thats what I aim at. Indeed, the more flexible you are, the lesser the pressure. The manner of handling pressure determines who wins and who loses... I mean, you cant have a rigid game plan. Surely, you have landed in choking situations... But, I dont think of pressure, dont get overwhelmed. In any case, if youre consistent, you dont worry... Moreover, I dont try and focus on what others expect out of me. Instead, I focus on my own expectations. Given that every team has a strategy, how flexible can an individual be? Its pretty much an individual thing... Its all about meeting both the team and individual goals... There was a time when you got promoted to No.4... Whats your preferred position? No.4... For a middle order batsman, thats the best position... At No.6, the opportunities are limited, but my approach doesnt change. Rotating the strike calls for much running. Is there a secret behind your fitness? (Grins again) At this age (33), Ive begun to feel the wear and tear... Its par for the course, though...Strength-work, aerobics, maintenance... Today, the Australian team is very professional about staying fit and, then, the support staff is excellent. Theres no secret. Does your intensity diminish when the earlier batsmen have put Australia into a position of much strength? My role has changed over the past two-three years... Now, Australia have a very good one-day team with such a quality attack... If we field first, for instance, our bowlers can restrict to 200-220 and, then, the top half can knock off the runs. Still, as crunch moments can come along, Ive got to make sure I do the best I can at No.6. Is life easy or difficult being part of such an outstanding team? Neither. Despite possessing such a fantastic strike-rate, do you envy anybody? Not envy, but I do admire quite a few players... The ones who didnt start being great but, with experience, have acquired that label... Somebody like Steve Waugh, who adjusted both as a cricketer and as a person... Somebody like Matthew Hayden or Andy Bichel... I respect the ones who have gone through tough periods to emerge strong... (After a pause) I believe its important to admire teammates... Helps team spirit. Changes in the laws apart, has the one-day game itself changed in the last decade? Players have been conscious about improving and, where batters are concerned, the shot-selection has got better. Of course, theres that element of pre-determination... We have set the bench mark and, today, its a question of some other team putting up its hand and saying right, were challenging you. With inputs from a range of specialists, hasnt cricket become easy? As I see it, the players have become more aware of the areas they need to improve. Beyond that, I dont have an opinion. What are the dos and donts? Its important to have a team goal... Then, from an individual perspective, youve got to be honest with yourself... What are the issues to be addressed? Where is improvement called for? Also, on the field, youve got to be strong. The better a teams fielding, the lesser the runs to chase. Its been almost six years since you last played a Test (versus South Africa, in Sydney)... Id like another opportunity as Im a better player... Looking back, I dont think I was prepared for Test cricket when I made my debut (mid Nineties)... There were aspects which needed to be addressed and Ive worked hard... Yet, Im pretty much resigned to the fact that another (Test) opportunity may not come my way. How would you describe this wait? Actually, its been a mix... Initially, trying to get back was a challenge... Then, obviously, theres been that frustration... At this point, Im not fazed  one way or the other. The final question: What have you learnt in nearly a decade of international cricket? To operate better... Im more aware of both my strengths and weaknesses... Ive appreciated the importance of improving and, over the years, have learnt to enjoy my environment...  Copyright

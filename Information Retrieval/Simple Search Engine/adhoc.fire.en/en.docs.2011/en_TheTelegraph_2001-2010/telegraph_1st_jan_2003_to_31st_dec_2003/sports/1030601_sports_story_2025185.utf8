The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dont know what made me a hit
- Leg-spin is a difficult art and complete control isnt easy... A sensitive captain can ease much of the pressure: Chandrasekhar BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Chandrasekhar  Calcutta, May 31: Twenty-four years after his last India appearance, Bhagwat Subrahmanya Chandrasekhar still cant pinpoint the one quality which made him an extraordinary matchwinner.I was unorthodox and, therefore, unpredictable However, I cant say how it all came about. But, yes, the records show I finished with 242 Test wickets, Chandra, who is on crutches (the consequence of being rammed by a truck 12 years ago), told The Telegraph this morning.Speaking before his return to Bangalore, after adding value to yesterdays Board-convened (spinners) brainstorming session, he continued: Getting wickets is what matters, not whether you can flight or spin the ball For instance, I never quite knew the intricacies of flightChandra, whose bowling (right) arm was affected by polio, revealed that while he didnt idolise any one bowler, he imagined how a Richie Benaud or even a Ray Lindwall would bowl and went about his business the same way.Those days, when I was growing up, exposure was only to tennis ball-cricket And, without any photographs or footage, I merely imagined how the Benauds and Lindwalls bowled and did likewise.In Chandras opinion, talent and luck are essential for making it big. Of course, the dedication bit is there, but some amount of talent is definitely needed At times, you also need to be lucky.He added: I wasnt ever either highly nervous or tense More often than not, my mind was free and that made a difference.Smiling (in between sips of coffee), Chandra, now 58, recalled that just three months changed his life at the start of the 1963-64 season. I took six wickets for the City Cricketers in an important knockout game (in Bangalore) and, then onwards, never looked backIndeed, a few months later came his Test debut (versus England, at the Brabourne Stadium) and Indias most mercurial matchwinner was off the blocks.Asked whether captains actually needed to handle leg-spinners  both conventional and unorthodox  with care, Chandra replied: Yes, because leg-spin is a difficult art Having complete control isnt always easy and a sensitive captain can ease much of the pressure.Some of his finest performances were under Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi and, appropriately, Chandra paid tribute.Pataudi was an attacking captain, keen on having a go even if half a chance was on offer I cant forget how he kept faith in me even after I had been taken for 20-odd runs in three overs, by the West Indies, at the Eden (1974-75). For us, it was a do-or-die situation and, thankfully, I got the breakthroughsThe quick (Chandra-plotted) dismissals of Alvin Kallicharran, captain Clive Lloyd and Bernard Julian ensured India won by 85 runs that New Years Day. More to the point, Pataudis move remains among the most inspired (and courageous too) by any captain.Chandra picked Colin Cowdrey and Ken Barrington, both of whom are no more, as the ones who faced him with supreme confidence. That he was so quick must surely have made it that much more challenging.Incidentally, Chandra grinned when asked if he could put a figure on his quickest delivery. My faster one was probably in the region of 85-90 miles per hour. Cant say for sure, though.Its not insignificant, perhaps, that Viv Richards once quipped: Maan, Chandras quickest would be as fast as ThommosMoving to the present era, Chandra avoided a direct answer on whether Anil Kumble, for whom he has always had time, should quit ODIs and concentrate on Test cricket. Its up to Anil He alone has to make that decision, but I do feel he has a couple of years leftDespite the pressure of time, one simply had to seek Chandras views on Team India 2003. Well, its a good side but, if you want a frank assessment, our bowling isnt terribly strong. Having said that, let me add most teams worldwide have the same shortcomingAs wife Sandhya favoured a round of shopping before setting out for the airport  the day, by the way, began early with a visit to the Kali temple  there was time for one last question: Today, what would his message be to youngsters?Dont imitate and, at every stage, learn to enjoy, was Chandras answer.

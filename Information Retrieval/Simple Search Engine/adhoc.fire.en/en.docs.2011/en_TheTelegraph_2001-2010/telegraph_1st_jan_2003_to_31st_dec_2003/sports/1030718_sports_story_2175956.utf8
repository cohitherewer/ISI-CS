 Sergio leaks the Steve secret
  Sergio Garcia claims McManaman is on the verge of a move to Arsenal Sandwich: Sergio Garcia may have let a secret slip on Thursday when he claimed his friend Steve McManaman was on the verge of leaving Real Madrid for Arsenal. Garcia, in Sandwich for the British Open, is a Real Madrid fan, and believes the arrival of England captain David Beckham will see his close pal McManaman leave. Beckhams arrival knocks McManaman further down the pecking order at the Bernabeu and the 31-year-old could be keen to move to see some first team action. I think Steve is talking to Arsenal, Garcia revealed. The Gunners, despite finishing second to Manchester United last season, are yet to make any signings to bolster their squad. Garcia said Beckhams arrival at Real was welcome though. I think its great. Hes a good footballer who gets a lot of exposure around the world and thats good for the team, he said. Although he has started just 19 league games in four years at the Spanish champions, McManaman denied he had any intention of leaving Madrid and returning to England. I have had lots of calls about my supposed move back to England and Im supposed to have lost my shirt number and been shown the door, the twice Champions League winner said. But its all nonsense. The truth is Im a Real Madrid player. We won the league and now Im on holiday. I love it at Madrid. Im going to be back training next week and then Im off on tour to the Far East, Mcmanaman added.

 Ponting No. 1, not Tendulkar
New Delhi: Ex-Pakistan cricketers, in the city to play against the Indian veterans, on Sunday hailed Ricky Ponting as the finest contemporary batsman. Former opener Sadiq Mohammad said: Ponting is a matchwinner whereas Tendulkar has not won many Tests for India. Tendulkar is like Zaheer Abbas, who was a beautiful batsman but never won a match for Pakistan. According to Shafqat Rana, another former Test player, if you put all the best batsmen of the present day on one screen, I would love to watch Ponting. Rana said former teammate Zaheer was another favourite. When he got going, Zaheer was a sight to watch. In one-day cricket Tendulkar is great! The Pakistan team won the second match by six wickets to level the series at 1-1.  Copyright

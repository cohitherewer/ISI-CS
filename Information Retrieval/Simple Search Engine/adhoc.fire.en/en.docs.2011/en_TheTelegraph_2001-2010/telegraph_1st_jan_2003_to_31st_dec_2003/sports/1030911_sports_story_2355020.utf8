 Dravid shouldnt keep, feels Kapil 
New Delhi: Kapil Dev feels Rahul Dravid is over-burdened and the Indian team should look for a regular wicketkeeper in one-day Internationals. He (Dravid) is the best person to judge. We need regulars for the team  be it a batsman, bowler or wicketkeeper. A makeshift option cannot continue for long, Kapil said. Kapil said the upcoming Test series against New Zealand will provide a lot of excitement since India will be keen to exact revenge. India need to play the same way New Zealand performed at home to beat them last year, he said.  Sehwag Delhi skipper Virender Sehwag was on Wednesday named Delhi skipper for the ensuing season. Mithun Manhas will be his deputy. The DDCA released a list of 43 other players who have been called for selection trials on September 20. The team will be coached by Madanlal. (PTI)  Copyright

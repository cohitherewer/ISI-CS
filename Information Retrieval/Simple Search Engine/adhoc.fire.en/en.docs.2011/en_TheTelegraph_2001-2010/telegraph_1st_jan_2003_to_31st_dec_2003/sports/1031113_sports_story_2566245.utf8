 Bryans thwart Woodbridge bid
Houston: Todd Woodbridges bid for a record-breaking doubles title triumph will have to wait after he and Jonas Bjorkman were eliminated from the ATP Masters Cup Doubles championship on Tuesday after a 6-4, 3-6, 6-7 (9-11) loss to Bob and Mike Bryan. With the Aussie-Swede duo up 5-1 in the third set tie-breaker, Woodbridge had looked poised to continue his march towards a 79th doubles crown after having equalled Dutchman Tom Okkers record of 78 two weeks ago in Stockholm. The Bryans, who captured their first Grand Slam title earlier this year at the French Open, saved two match-points before clinching the 20-point tie-breaker. The hard-earned win took the top-ranked American twins to the semi-finals, thus keeping them on course to become the first brothers to capture the year-end number one spot. The tie-break we sort of gave it away twice we had our opportunity and played tentatively, said Woodbridge, who will open next season with events in Doha and Sydney, giving him a chance to break the record on home soil. Its disappointing but the record is going to come when it comes... I cant push that. Whats positive is, I played three tough, good matches here and Im ready to go back to Australia for the Davis Cup. Woodbridge made his debut on the ATP Tour in 1988 and won his first doubles title in 1990 in Casablanca with compatriot Simon Youl.. Of his 15 Slams, eight have come at Wimbledon.

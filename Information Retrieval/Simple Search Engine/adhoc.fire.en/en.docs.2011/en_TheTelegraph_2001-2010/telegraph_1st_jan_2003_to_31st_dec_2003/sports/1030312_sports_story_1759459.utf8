				 																																	Bloemfontein: According to Andy Flower, there are two categories of batsmen: Sachin Tendulkar, and the rest.				 																																	He is the best in the world, Flower said of the Indian player. The rest of us, who are more human, make mistakes sometimes. But people watch him bat and they think all of us should play as well as he does. It doesnt quite work like that. Flower had been asked why he, as one of the games premier batsmen, had not cashed in against the weaker teams in the World Cup. Flower scored 39 against Namibia and 71 against the Netherlands. Zimbabwe will have their last opportunity against a minor side when they play Kenya in Bloemfontein on Wednesday.				 																																	Shouldnt Flower be looking to score a century against his African cousins? I agree. All of our batsmen should aim to score hundreds against them, Flower said.				 																																	Flowers World Cup career record could also do with the boost of a century on Wednesday.				 																																	Johannesburg: South Africas chief selector Omar Henry on Tuesday defended his teams controversial quota system and insisted it cant be used as an excuse for the countrys dismal World Cup performance.				 																																	Cricketers, both black and white, must accept this as part of todays set-up, Henry said. We have a legacy that we have to correct, and we have to learn to function successfully within that context.				 																																	Prior to the tournament, Ali Bacher, now the World Cup supremo, gave late sports minister Steve Tshwete a promise that five coloured players would be included in the 15-man squad. Herschelle Gibbs, Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson, Charl Langeveldt and Monde Zondeki were the coloured players in the 15-man squad. But the selection of Boland seamer Langeveldt caused most uproar.				 																																	What he does with what he has learned is up to him, Henry told the Business Day newspaper. He can take negatives or he can take positives out of the experience and this will define his future.				 																																	Colombo: Sri Lankan media came down hard on their cricket team following their humiliating 183-run defeat to India in a Super Six match Monday.				 																																	Indians roast Lankan lame ducks, screamed the banner headline in Daily Mirror, while Island wrote Tendulkar fireworks reduces Sri Lanka to ashes.				 																																	The state-run Daily News printed the most prophetic of all comments.				 																																	In a commentary, it said Sri Lanka, who won the coveted trophy in 1996, did not deserve a place in the Super Sixes. Lets face it. Do we deserve it. From me it is no, said columnist Elmo Rodrigopulle.				 																																	We say this because our victories, down the line other than dumping of Bangladesh and Canada have not been convincing and authoritative.				 																																	He said the team given to Jayasuriya was also not balanced. Meanwhile, angry fans called up radio and television stations to register their disappointment and charged that the Lankans had sold the match to India. 				 																																	nKenya vs Zimbabwe, live on Max from 1.30 pm n New Zealand vs Australia, highlights on Max from 8.30 am n Taking Guard on ESPN and STAR Sports from 12.30 pm

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Reasonable lay-off needed 
	 - Sourav still in pain  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Dona Ganguly on Sunday at a city clinic where Sourav is admitted. Picture by Santosh Ghosh  Chandigarh: Sourav Ganguly, the regular Team  India captain, looks certain not to play the first three  tri-series matches. Moreover, theres this distinct possibility  about his missing a few more games.  If India make the final of the tournament, then a  total of seven matches will be played. The opening game  is in Chennai on October 23.  According to The Telegraphs  sources, Sourav  who underwent a second operation inside  five days on his left upper thigh, on Saturday morning   needs a reasonable lay-off to recover from the double  surgery in the same region. The sources added that while Souravs general condition is better, the pain is often excruciating. Then, the very heavy dose of antibiotics is not contributing to making him feel cheerful. Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya is due to call on Sourav on Monday and, then, a clearer picture should emerge. Meanwhile, Hemang Badani, a top contender for replacing Sourav in the XIV for the first three tri-series matches, has furnished a fitness certificate. Badani, it may be recalled, suffered a fracture during the India A-New Zealand game in Rajkot.  The other contenders are Sanjay Bangar, Sridharan  Sriram and Rohan Gavaskar.  A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds:  Sourav was given six bottles of saline on Saturday. Officially,  he is free from fever and exhaustion and slept well in  the night, but the doctors are of the view that  it would be safe to assume Sourav would not be released  before Wednesday. There is some improvement of inflammation, and the culture report from the wound before Saturdays surgical procedure shows growth of staphylococcus aureus (a kind of bacteria), said the doctors. But he is having necessary antibiotics. Doctors were not willing to put an early date to his release, saying the general method was to rest such patient for at least ten days .  Meanwhile, a commando has been posted outside his  room. Entry being restricted, very few were allowed in on  Saturday. On Sunday, though, relatives and close friends  could visit him.  Copyright

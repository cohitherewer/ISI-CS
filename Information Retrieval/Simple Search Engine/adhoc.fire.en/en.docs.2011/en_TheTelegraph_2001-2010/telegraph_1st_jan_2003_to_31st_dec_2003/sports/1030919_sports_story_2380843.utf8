 Relief for Punjab Police stars
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT  Chandigarh: Having cracked  down on out-of-turn promotions to implement a 1998 Punjab  and Haryana High Court ruling, Punjab Police has now said  no distinguished sportsperson will be demoted. According to a senior police officer, the controversy regarding reversion of promotions provided to sportspersons in the state was aimed at lowering the morale of the recipients. It is ridiculous to even think of reverting hockey star Jugraj Singh, cricketer Harbhajan Singh and athlete Sunita Rani to the post of a head constable, the officer added. Many sportspersons serving with the Punjab Armed Police are reported to have stated that they would leave their job if they are demoted to a lower post than the one they hold at present. New rules are also being framed for recruiting sportspersons in the organisation. The government on Thursday was granted time till October 21 by the high court to seek the Punjab Armed Polices views on ad-hoc promotions and respond to the petition of some personnel in the general category, who have claimed that ad-hoc promotions had hurt their careers. There is no distinguished sportsperson mentioned in the list of 15 respondents in their petition. A new transfer and posting policy for field police personnel in consonance with state government guidelines and the polices operational requirements is also being formulated to make service rules stricter. A Punjab Police spokesman said the new policy will streamline the transfer procedure.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roddick has his revenge on Federer
 - Nalbandian dumps Schuettler to set up an American date  in Montreal
 Andy Roddick celebrates his thrilling three-set win as the victim Roger Federer leaves court at the Montreal Masters on Saturday. (AFP) Montreal: Andy Roddick advanced to the final of the Montreal Masters after a thrilling 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 win over Roger Federer on Saturday, depriving the Wimbledon champion of the opportunity to oust Andre Agassi from the world No. 1 spot. Roddick will face world No. 21 David Nalbandian in the final of the $2.45 million tournament, after the unseeded Argentine rallied from a set down to beat German eighth seed Rainer Schuettler 3-6, 6-2, 6-2. The 20-year-old American, who had lost all his previous previous clashes with Federer, including the much-hyped semi-final at 2003 Wimbledon, was down a break and trailing 4-2 in the third, but rallied past Federer 7-3 in the tie-break when the 22-year-old double-faulted and made four unforced errors. It was nice, it was definitely not looking good for a while, Roddick said. Roddick felt the turning point came in the third set when he had to hit a half-volley from between his legs while rushing to the net. The ball landed in and the crowd erupted in awe. I guess it was just reaction. It was either that or get hit in the nuts, said Roddick. But you know, that definitely took the edge off, it was kind of fun. Federer traded nine aces with Roddick during the match, but had ten double faults, compared to only two for the sixth-seeded American. I made a few double faults, but it happened because I wanted to take some risks, I wanted to take control because I didnt wish to get into rallies against him, Federer said. Federer, who will move ahead of French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero to second in the world when the new rankings are released, could have also displaced Agassi if he had beaten Roddick. Ive never been No. 1, but Ive never been No. 2 either, so lets take the positive part of the story, Federer said. Roddick has a 23-2 record since he joined forces with coach Brad Gilbert, who turned 42 on Saturday. Hes been great. Were very relaxed together all the time. Its not too intense, which is a change of pace and it seems to be working so far, Roddick said. I dont feel like Im playing hot, I feel like Im pretty solid. I come out knowing what Im going to get from myself on a daily basis, and I havent had that feeling before, Roddick said. Roddick won the only match he played against Nalbandian, disposing of him 6-3, 6-2 in the quarter finals of last years hardcourt tournament in Toronto. Nalbandians win over Schuettler in their fourth meeting of the year ensured that this event would be his best performance of the season, surpassing a semi-final appearance at Hamburg in May. With the victory Nalbandian moved 4-3 ahead of Schuettler in overall results between the two but it was his first triumph on a surface other than clay. The key to winning the match was my better serve and playing high on his backhand, Nalbandian said after reaching his first Masters Series final. Schuettler felt a lack of consistency was the reason for his defeat. He served pretty well and I didnt return that well. My return is usually my strength and today I missed a lot, he said. There were long rallies in the second and third sets and I was making mistakes while he didnt miss much. He was the better player today. If he wins the title, the Argentine player will surge into the top 10 of the ATP Champions Race.  (Reuters)  Copyright

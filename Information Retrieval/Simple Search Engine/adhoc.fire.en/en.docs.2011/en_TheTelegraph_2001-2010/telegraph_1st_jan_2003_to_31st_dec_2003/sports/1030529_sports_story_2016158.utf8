 Lee suffers mild concussion
St Georges: Australian fast bowler Brett Lee was hit in the back of the neck with a ball during a training session and suffered a mild concussion on Wednesday, team officials said. Jimmy Maher was batting, and a stray stroke sent the ball flying toward the pacer. Lee was stretching when he was hit. They said he had a mild concussion and had been given orders to rest for the remainder of the day. The 26-year-old could be still available for the sixth ODI on Friday. (AP)  Copyright

(Reuters) Dhaka: New captain Graeme Smith said Thursday it was time for South Africa to look forward rather than constantly harking back to past disappointments. The 22-year-old left-handed opening batsman, a surprise choice to lead the team after Shaun Pollock was axed following the World Cup, said: We need a fresh start. Speaking before the start of the tri-series against Bangladesh and India, he added: We were badly criticised for the World Cup failure. I will try to implement my own vision. I wont follow anyone.

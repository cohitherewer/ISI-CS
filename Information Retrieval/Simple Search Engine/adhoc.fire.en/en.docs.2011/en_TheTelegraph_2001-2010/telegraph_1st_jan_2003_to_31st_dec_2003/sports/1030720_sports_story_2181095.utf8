 Sania to train overseas 
 Sanias focus is on improving fitness Hyderabad, July 19 (PTI): Wimbledon junior girls doubles champion Sania Mirza plans to go abroad for a physical fitness programme. Next year Sania should be going abroad for a physical training programme, coach Mahesh Bhupathi said in an informal chat with reporters at a function here on Saturday. We will be cutting down on her junior level tournaments in the coming days and lay more focus on her physical training programme to strengthen her base, Bhupathi, whose company Globosport has been taking care of Sanias coaching, said. Sania would, however, play in the US Open and a few other important tournaments at junior level, Bhupathi said. When asked to elaborate on what physical fitness programme he has in mind for Sania, Bhupathi said, Her base has to be strengthened to match her European counterparts who are very strong and fit. The programme would help Sania move faster and endure longer games more so in singles, he said. Earlier, Sania said Europeans have strong legs and can endure long rallies but it is difficult for Indians to stretch the game to the desired extent. Meanwhile, GVK Industries, who organised the function, announced that it would continue to sponsor Sania. Among those who attended the event were Mohammed Azharuddin and wife Sangeeta Bijlani.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Szabo cleared of wrongdoing
Paris: French border police, who seized drugs in a car belonging to Gabriela Szabo earlier this month, have declared the case closed and cleared the Romanian Olympic champion of any wrongdoing. Its a routine case of undeclared importation of medical products, a border police officer told sports daily LEquipe. No doping product was found. The case wont be handed to the prosecutors office, the officer added in an interview published on Tuesday. The border police stopped the car on a motorway at La Turbie, near Monaco on May 9, and arrested Daniel Vlad, a friend of Szabos, who was driving the car.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

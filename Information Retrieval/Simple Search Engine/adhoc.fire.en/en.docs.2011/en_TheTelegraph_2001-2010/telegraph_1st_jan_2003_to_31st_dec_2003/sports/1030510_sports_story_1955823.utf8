				 																																																	 Mohammedan Sporting registered quite a few gains in the inter-club transfer market on Friday. A day after confirming Dipendu Biswas, the new National League entrants roped in Khalid Siddique and Syed Hussain from Mahindra United, Zaheer Abbas of Churchill Brothers and promising Salgaocar midfielder Bungo Singh. While Siddique is a former international, who went out of the limelight with an injury, Bungo is highly rated by many and spent a season with Mohun Bagan earlier.				 																																																	East Bengal also strengthened their roster by retaining the services of key defender Dipak Mondal, goalkeeper Arpan De and utility player Subhashish Roy Chowdhury. Mohun Bagan also got JCT defenders Daljit Singh and Hardeep Saini to sign the inter-state transfer certificates on what turned out to be a decent day for them. They are yet to decide on the coach.				 																																																	 Mohun Bagan beat Bally Gramanchal 7-0, while Barasat Yubak Sangha defeated NPC 10-0 in womens football league. Shanta Dhara (3), Nosaba Alam, Rinku Ghosh, Srabanti Chatterjee and Dulali Ghosh scored for Mohun Bagan. Maya Biswas (4), Santana Chakraborty (3), Bandana Pal, Barna Roy and Jaya Rou scored for the Barasat team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Emphatic victory for Geet Sethi
 Geet Sethi showed his class, beating Huang Chol-ho Hyderabad: Top seed Geet Sethi showed his class to score an emphatic win against Huang Chol-ho (South Korea) while fourth seed Dhruv Sitwala was humbled by unsung Loon Hong-moh (Malaysia) in the world billiards championship on Wednesday. The other seeded players edged out their opponents in the league phase of the championship being played for the first time in 150-up format. Three-time world title-holder Sethi, who was very prolific with huge breaks in the time play format, was at ease in the shorter version as well and outplayed his Korean opponent 150-6, 150-2, 150-26. Winning the first frame in just two visits, Sethi enthralled the morning session spectators with an unfinished break of 150 in the second frame after the Korean ended his first visit after scoring only two points. In the third game, Sethi looked a bit shaky in the initial stages but was back in his elements to stop the flow of his opponent and settle the issue 150-26. Dhruv lost to Loon in a pitched battle where fortunes swung from one end to the other. Dhruv lost his concentration in the final frame before finally going down 65-150 67-151 151-121 151-68 110-150 in the gruelling match. Third seed Devendra Joshi and Ashok Shandilya along with fifth seed Nalin Patel scored easy victories against their respective rivals while sixth seed Joe Minici of Australia survived a scare to edge past Yeo Teck-shen Glenn of Singapore. Yesterday, 18-year-old Pankaj Advani stretched his form further to win a difficult match against Eugene Huges of the Republic of Ireland, while Rishabh Thakkar and Siddarth Parikh were the other Indians to register wins on Tuesday. Continuing his winning streak, Advani trounced Huges 14-151, 151-96, 150-5, 150-138.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav sets fitness deadline
 - DHAKA TRI-SERIES l BCCI may appoint manager-cum-coach to offset Wrights absence  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav: Troublesome back Calcutta, April 5: Sourav Ganguly, undergoing treatment for a back problem, is understood to have set himself a Sunday-evening deadline on whether or not to lead India in the April 11-beginning tri-series in Dhaka. While the captain wasnt available for comment, a confidant told The Telegraph this afternoon: Sourav must give the selectors time to pick a replacement if that troublesome back prevents him from going If he cant make it, the powers-that-be should be intimated around tomorrow evening The Indian squad departs from Calcutta on April 9. If Sourav opts out, the captaincy will automatically go to Virender Sehwag and the selectors will also have to appoint a vice-captain. Going by the time spent in deliberating on that position during Wednesdays meeting in Mumbai, it may not be that simple a task. Incidentally, the merits/drawbacks of Zaheer Khan, Mohammed Kaif (an U-19 World Cup-winning captain) and Yuvraj Singh were discussed before Brijesh Patel and his colleagues (Pranab Roy included) settled for Sehwag as Souravs deputy. As is known, Sachin Tendulkar, regular vice-captain Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Jawagal Srinath and Ashish Nehra made themselves unavailable before Wednesdays meeting. Then, two first-choice replacements  V.V.S.Laxman and Murali Kartik  couldnt be picked because of injury/surgery. To queer the pitch even more, coach John Wrights father (Geoff) has passed away in Christchurch and, so, even he wont be available. The funeral was held today, but other rites remain. This has surely landed Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya in a spot of bother. Given that the tournament is only till April 20, we could do without a stand-in coach. Or, otherwise, a former cricketer may be designated manager-cum-coach Lets see he remarked late this evening. The decision could be on hold till Monday, when the BCCI office-bearers assemble in New Delhi for a (World Cup-associated) reception hosted by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. It wont surprise, however, if former International and selector Ashok Malhotra, coach on the recent India A tour of the West Indies, is appointed manager-cum-coach. That hardly anybody within the BCCI has been angling for the managership  wholly because Dhaka isnt seen as an attractive enough destination  should make it easy for Dalmiya to have one man for two roles. Usually, of course, the managership is a prized catch. Besides the hosts and India, the tri-series will feature South Africa.  Copyright

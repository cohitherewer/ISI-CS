 Rain halts Baird march
Harrison (New York): Heavy rain forced the suspension of the Buick Classic third round Saturday, with organisers hopeful the final two rounds can be completed on Sunday. Briny Baird, one clear of the field overnight and chasing his first PGA Tour title, had doubled his lead and was 11-under after six holes when play was called off for the day. Skip Kendall was second at nine-under, also after six holes, one stroke ahead of Tom Gillis, after eight, and Joey Sindelar, after seven. British Open champion Ernie Els was in a share of seventh at six-under, after 11 holes, while world No. 1 Tiger Woods was among a group of five tied for 15th at five-under, after seven. Players had teed off in threesomes from the first and tenth holes in a bid to beat the weather, but none managed to complete Saturdays third round. No PGA Tour event has been shortened to 54 holes since the 2000 BellSouth Classic, won by Phil Mickelson in a play-off. The tournament to be carried over into Monday was the 2001 Players Championship, won by Woods.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

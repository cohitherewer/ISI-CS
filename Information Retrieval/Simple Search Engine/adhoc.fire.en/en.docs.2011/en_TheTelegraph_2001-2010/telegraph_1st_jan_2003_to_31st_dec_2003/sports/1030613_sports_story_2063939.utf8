The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Money top on BCCI agenda
New Delhi: Financial matters will top cricket board president Jagmohan Dalmiyas agenda when he attends the executive committee meeting of the ICC in London next week. It is learnt that the Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), the sponsorship rights holders to World Cups 2003 and 2007, have sought compensation to the tune of Rs 250 crore from the ICC for breach of the ambush marketing contract by the Indian cricket players, for New Zealands refusal to play in Kenya and for a similar boycott of Zimbabwe by England. The ICC, anticipating such a claim by the GCC, had withheld $ 8-9 million due to the BCCI, $ 3.5 million due to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and $ 2.5 million marked for New Zealand Cricket (NZC). The ICC is sure to forward the claim matter to its executive committee members in the meeting, justifying holding on to the guarantee money of a few countries for the 2003 World Cup. Also, it is almost certain the Indian cricket board will dispute it and the matter will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sports in Lausanne. Though the ICC has held on to guarantee money to the BCCI, it has released the prize money which was due to India for finishing runners-up in the tournament. Dalmiya is also expected to rake up the issue of ICC dragging its feet on the Mike Denness affair. Match Referee Denness had handed a suspended suspension to Sachin Tendulkar for ball-tampering  as well as separate punishment to five other Indian cricketers  during the Port Elizabeth Test of the 2001-2002 series in South Africa. At home too, money matters will hog the attention of the cricket board. The board is in the process of finalising the insurance scheme for first class cricketers and their talk is at an advanced stage with a couple of insurance companies. It would almost double the current insurance cover for first class cricketers. It is also learnt that sponsors Sahara India has released the Rs 1 crore plus for its involvement in the triangular tournament in Dhaka in April. But the dues of the World Cup have not been paid by Sahara, citing the ambush clause conflict with the ICC.  (PTI)  Copyright

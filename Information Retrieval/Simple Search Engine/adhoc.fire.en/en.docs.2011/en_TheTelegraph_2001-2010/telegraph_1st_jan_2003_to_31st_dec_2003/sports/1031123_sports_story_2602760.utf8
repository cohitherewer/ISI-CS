The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Skipper backs his young pacers
 Sourav feels Zaheer amp; Co. wont have problems adjusting Adelaide, Nov. 22 (AP): India captain Sourav Ganguly said on Saturday his teams recent poor performance against Australia  three consecutive ODI losses  will give the hosts the mental edge in their four-Test series beginning next month. Sourav, who arrived with his teammates in Adelaide, agreed the Indians had a mental barrier to overcome. Weve lost to them three times in the last one month in one-day cricket and we accept theyre a good side playing good cricket, he said. Thats why its more of a challenge to raise our game and perform at par with them in Australia. We know they are going to be a tough side they win overseas and at home, will be even tougher. Sourav doubted his inexperienced pace attack will struggle on the bouncy Australian pitches. Indias most experienced pace bowlers will be Zaheer Khan (26 Tests) and Ashish Nehra (13), but Sourav said both had proved themselves. They were inexperienced in the World Cup and to be honest they were on par with the best in the world, if you go through the records, Sourav said. Even before the World Cup, we went to New Zealand and the fast bowlers took wickets. Sourav added his team had a core of experienced batsmen who had toured Australia before, and that Indias once poor overseas record had improved.  Copyright

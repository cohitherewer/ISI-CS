The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Salgaocar outclass Md. Sp. 3-0 
 Bello Rassaq drew first blood for Salgaocar Margao: Mohammedan Sporting managed to hold Salgaocar goalless in the first half. But their resistance was no where to be seen after the change of sides as the hosts ran riot in the black-and-white brigades area, completely outplayed the visitors and finally scored a comprehensive 3-0 win in a National Football League (NFL) match at Nehru Stadium here on Sunday. Salgaocars all second-half goals came through defender Bello Rassaq (59th minute), substitute Samson Singh (77th) and Felix Ibrebru (90th). Mohammedan Sporting, who were pushed on the back foot, had a close look at the rival goal only once when an Odafa header in the second half went over off a flag kick taken by Khalid Siddiqui. Salgaocar could have won by a bigger margin had their strikers Felix and Freed Mascarenhas directed their shots on target. Salgaocar, who beat East Bengal earlier, now have six points, thanks to their second successive win. Mohammedan Sporting, on the other hand, have lost both their outings. The absence of Tomba Singh was hardly felt in Salgaocars middle half as Dharamjit Singh, who was booked in the match for indecent behaviour, Jatin Bist, Climax Lawrence, Andragui Singh, combined well to put the rival defence under tremendous pressure, who packed with more men and resisted them from scoring in the first half. Salgaocar finally tasted success in the second half when Rassaq, who overlapped often, met Bist corner kick to nod home. Salgaocar increased the lead in the 32nd minute when a move found Samson near the box, and the substitute got past a defender before unleashing a left-footer to find the net. Felix, who missed a chance earlier, than made amends for his lapse when he headed in a cross from Dharamjit to complete Salgaocars demolition of the NFL debutants.  (PTI)  Copyright

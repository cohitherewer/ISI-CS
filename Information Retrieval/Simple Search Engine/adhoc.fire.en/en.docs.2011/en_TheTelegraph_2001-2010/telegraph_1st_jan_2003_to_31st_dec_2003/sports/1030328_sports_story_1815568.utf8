		 Friday, March 28, 2003  Dubai World Cup to go ahead despite the war 
				 	 Dubai World Cup favourite Nayef (Richard Hills-up) on his morning workouts at the Nad-al-Sheba race-track Thursday (AFP)				 										Dubai (Agencies): The US$ 6 million Dubai World Cup, the worlds richest horse race, will go ahead on Saturday at the Nad-al-Sheba racecourse as planned, according to the organisers, despite the US-led war on nearby Iraq.				 										Trainer Todd Pletcher, in the meanwhile, expressed happiness with Harlans Holiday after arriving in Dubai on Thursday following a long trip from the United States. He wasted no time in getting to Nad al Sheba racecourse to check on his first-ever Dubai World Cup starter. To his satisfaction he also found the four-year-old son of Harlans healthy and apparently ready for Saturdays big race.				 										Pletcher also took a turn on the stage with commentator Chris Lincoln as one of the luminaries in a special Breakfast with the Stars program for fans, media, owners, trainers, and jockeys during morning trackwork. Anytime you come in for a race of this magnitude, theres a lot of excitement, Pletcher said, Its very difficult whenever you have to travel as far as you have to travel to come here but (Harlans Holiday) seems to have handled that well. Hes fit and were just trying to keep him happy.				 										Despite the conflict in the Middle East, Pletcher said he was not worried about traveling to Dubai, particularly after talking to his friend and colleague, Kiaran McLaughlin, who is based in Dubai for about five months every year and told him there was no reason to be apprehensive.				 										The facilities at Nad al Sheba are impressive, Pletcher said, adding that he was still trying to take them all in while groggy from his long flight and the difference in time. Dubai is nine hours ahead of the time in Florida, where Pletcher is currently based at Gulfstream Park.				 										Although Pletcher singled out Godolphins Moon Ballad and Grandera as well as Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid al Maktoums Nayef, the World Cup favourite, as tough contenders in the World Cup, he predicted that Harlans Holiday will enjoy an advantage of being a true dirt horse. Competing solely in the U.S., Harlans Holiday has raced only on dirt, winning three Grade 1 events  the 2002 Florida Derby, Blue Grass Stakes and Februarys Donn Handicap.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Maiden senior title for Palit
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Somak Palit with the trophy on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Nov. 8: The fourth WBCA-organised Fide-rated tournament, which concluded on Saturday, didnt have too many established names. It was basically a meet for aspiring youngsters and one of them, Somak Palit, made the most of it by winning his first title at the senior level. The 17-year-old finished the 11-round meet tied on 9.5 points with IM Shanker Roy, but clinched the title by virtue of a better tie-break score. Shanker (second) was followed by the outstation trio of R. Balasubramaniam, R.R. Laxman and Sudhir Kumar Sinha. Palit took home Rs 30,000. It was his victories in the last two rounds that tilted the scales in Palits favour. It isnt the biggest success of my career. Winning the national sub-junior meet in 2001 remains the best one, said Palit, champion at The Telegraph Schools Chess meet in 2001. Beginning this year with a rating of 2256, the standard XI student has made decent progress this year. I want to play more rating tournaments and secure the GM title in two years, said the Goodricke Academy trainee. Palit has one IM norm so far, earned in early 2002. Final standings 1. Somak Palit (9.5); 2. Shanker Roy (9.5); 3. R. Balasubramaniam (8.5); 4. R.R. Laxman (8.5); 5. Sudhir Kumar Sinha (8).  Copyright

 Tiger blinded by Royal St Georges
 Tiger Woods walks past a St Georges flag during a practice round in Sandwich on Sunday Sandwich (England): Tiger Woods played Royal St Georges for the first time on Sunday. His analysis at the end of the day  he might need a few more rounds to get a feel for this British Open. On some holes, he couldnt figure out which way to go. On others, he couldnt believe where his ball wound up. Theres a lot of blind shots, Woods said after playing 18 holes with Charles Howell III on a warm, windy day on the South Eastern coast. Youre going to have to play a few rounds to get an idea where to go, he said. On a couple of holes, I didnt know which way to go. Which holes? I cant remember, Woods said with a laugh. His only experience of Royal St Georges is videotape of 1993, the last time the British Open was held on the quirky links. Greg Norman won that year, closing with a 64 to hold off Nick Faldo and a collection of the games best players. Normans 13-under 267 stands as the British Open record, and it might be safe if the weather continues to be unseasonably sunny and warm. It has left the fairways brown and brittle, and the wind coming off Pegwell Bay makes it hard to control tee shots. Woods found that to be the case on the 460-yard 18th hole. He had a driver in his hand, then put that back and chose a 2-iron. He paused again, selecting a 3-wood, and his tee shot into a right-to-left wind rolled all the way into a bunker. He dropped a ball short of the bunker, and his approach bounced onto and over the green. Woods said the firm, fast conditions remind him of St Andrews, where he completed the career Grand Slam three years ago with an eight-shot victory. Only this course is nothing like St Andrews. While Royal St Georges has its share of bunkers, the humps and hollows along the fairway make it difficult to keep the ball in the short grass. The fairways are the most severe Ive seen, Woods said. On the 458-yard 17th, woods hit a 2-iron that drew gently to the middle of the fairway. The massive mounding  which looks like someone did a bad job burying elephants  kicked his ball into the left rough. The slopes are steep, Woods said. You saw what happened on 17. I hit it right down the middle and its in the rough, because I hit it too firm. Woods isnt alone. Only six of the top 20 players in the world ranking have played a British Open at Royal St Georges, so most of them will be just as unfamiliar with the links. And while Woods studied the tapes, there is no guarantee hell get the same conditions from 10 years ago, especially a brief downpour that softened the course just before the leaders teed off in the final round. Totally different conditions, Woods said. You could see guys holding shots. Not today.  (AP)  Copyright

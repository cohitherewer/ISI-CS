The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwag captain, even if Sourav plays
 - Three-dayer vs Australia a - Sachin, Kumble decline to lead  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Gangulys  kitbag remains untraced  Much of the attention  will be on Murali KartikHobart: After a rethink, influenced by the urge not to concede even a single psychological point ahead of the back-to-back Tests in Melbourne and Sydney, Sourav Ganguly is likely to play the three-dayer here versus Australia A. However, the captaincy has been handed to Virender Sehwag. Initially, Sourav, vice-captain Rahul Dravid, V.V.S.Laxman, Ajit Agarkar and the recuperating Zaheer Khan were to skip the match beginning on Friday. But, at Thursday evenings team meeting, there was the realisation that the middle-order would be bereft of experience  against a potentially quality attack  if three stalwarts sat out. According to The Telegraphs sources, coach John Wright and manager Shivlal Yadav then requested Sourav to have a rethink without the captaincy. His decision will be known in the morning, but theres a problem as his kitbag remains untraced. Apparently, some luggage was off-loaded in Melbourne on Wednesday, when the team took a connecting flight for Hobart, and nobody is sure where the captains kit-bag has gone. Usually, it is sent straight to the ground but, as Sourav didnt have a workout on Thursday, its unclear whether his kit-bag is actually in the Bellerive Oval dressing room. [Agarkar, by the way, had a similar worry. Thankfully, it got sorted out.] If Sourav does play, though, then Anil Kumble should rest. Earlier in the day, there was considerable drama as senior pros Sachin Tendulkar and Kumble declined to lead, preferring just to concentrate on their game. And, with Laxman getting a break, the team management had no option but to hand the job to Sehwag. Sehwag, it may be recalled, was vice-captain during this years tri-series in Dhaka and led in one match (versus Bangladesh) when Sourav took a break. While theres suspense over Sourav, what is certain is that the wicketkeepers duties will be shared by Parthiv Patel and Deep Dasgupta. The arrangement had been similar in the three-dayer against the Queensland Academy of Sports. Much of the attention, however, will be on Murali Kartik. Rushed as a cover for Harbhajan Singh, on the eve of the Adelaide Test, the left-armer will be playing his first game in Australia. Its an opportunity, yes, but Ive got to acclimatise... After all, bowling at nets and bowling in a match isnt quite the same... Moreover, Im not putting myself under pressure... Rather, Im going to treat the game as any other first-class fixture, he pointed out. Led by Western Australias Michael Hussey, the Australia A XI is formidable. Apart from the captain himself, the side has quality batsmen in Martin Love and Brad Hodge. Then, in Shaun Tait and Paul Rofe, it has two very promising quicks. Both play for South Australia. Also, not to be missed out is highly-rated allrounder Michael Clarke. He is the vice-captain. Incidentally, while it rained for much of the day  forcing the Indians to train at the excellent indoor facility  the sky cleared late in the evening. The forecast, one understands, isnt discouraging. But, then... Meanwhile, spearhead Zaheer is recovering well from the left hamstring problem, an injury which kept him out of the second Test. He should be fit for the third (in Melbourne), Sourv informed. Irfan Pathan will then have to sit out. TEAMS India: Akash Chopra, Virender Sehwag, Sadagopan Ramesh, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly/Anil Kumble, Deep Dasgupta, Parthiv Patel, Murali Kartik, Irfan Pathan, Ashish Nehra and Lakshmipathy Balaji. Australia A: Michael Hussey, Michael Clarke, Chris Rogers, Martin Love, Brad Hodge, Cameron White, Wade Seccombe, Matthew Nicholson, Damien Wright, Paul Rofe and Shaun Tait.  Copyright

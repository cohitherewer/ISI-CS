		 Wednesday, October 01, 2003  Moon Mission gets Yadav year-long suspension 
 BY STAR RACER		 ShankarCalcutta: The stipendiary  stewards and the stewards were commended on Tuesday following  their stern actions against erring professionals in order  to make the city sport clean. They handed a long suspension  to jockey R. Yadav for not permitting his mount, Moon Mission   from Daniel Davids yard  to run on her merits in the  days main event, the Unknown Warrior Cup. The race was  won by Ballet Master, a ward of trainer Errol Bhungard,  the former deputy of Daniel. Yadavs suspension starts from  October 10 and ends on April 30, 2004. But his period of  punishment may drag on till October 15, 2004 as his plea  for the renewal of license will not be considered after  the conclusion of the winter season in April 2004.				 										The stewards also opened an enquiry into the running of Moira, a Deepak Karki-ward, who was ridden by E. Smith in the Ex-Servicemens Handicap. The enquiry will be conducted next week. The afternoon was, otherwise, ruled by Shanker who booted home four winners, including three for trainer Vijay Singh. Amyn Merchant also scored a treble while Daniel ended up with a brace of winners.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

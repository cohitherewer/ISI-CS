The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Ehsan Mani active behind the scenes
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI																								Calcutta: While hardliners within the International Cricket Council (ICC) are inclined to reject the Indians conditional signing of the six-page Player Terms (or contract), a move is afoot to accept the same with a proviso that the dispute be settled through arbitration only. Perhaps, even after the World Cup.																								The aim, obviously, is to allow the forthcoming tournament to take off without a major controversy being the focal point of its build-up. Crickets biggest event can surely do without all the attention on the Lausanne-located Court of Arbitration for Sports. 																								According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, an emergent meeting of the ICCs Executive Board is likely to be called once the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) meets Tuesdays deadline for forwarding the Terms, duly signed by all 15 players.																								The Terms must reach the IDI Ltd, business arm of the ICC, by 10.30 pm (IST).																								The mood, at the moment, is against India. Yet, the (Boards) directors are being persuaded to adopt a softer stand  for now, at least, is how one of the sources put it, requesting anonymity.																								Officially, though, the ICC wont respond till the Terms actually reach the IDI Ltd. At this point, theres no reaction, informed spokesman Mark Harrison.																								Incidentally, as the BCCI hasnt yet received the originals of the Terms (from New Zealand), it will effectively be re-faxing all 90 pages  each player signed the contract individually  forwarded by manager Nathu Ram Choudhary late last week.																								The originals will be couriered once weve received them from New Zealand, a BCCI spokesman clarified late Monday. 																								Every player, by the way, has signed on page 5 and, from Sourav Ganguly to Parthiv Patel, each one has listed what is unacceptable just above the space provided for inking the Terms.																								Meanwhile, Pakistans Ehsan Mani, the London-based ICC vice-president, has emerged a key player in efforts to resolve the row. 																								Mani  who will become the second Asian (after buddy Jagmohan Dalmiya) to head the ICC, in June  wasnt available for comment, but sources confirmed he has been most active behind the scenes.																								Apparently, Mani has been trying to convince hardliners to accept the conditional signing with that very clear (Lausanne-specific) proviso.																								However, if the hardliners view prevails, the BCCI will either have to get the Terms signed afresh  unconditionally  or, if thats not feasible, select the best available 15 and possibly open itself to claims for compensation.																								The BCCI, of course, sees the dispute somewhat differently.

Mumbai: Mohammedan Sporting went down fighting 3-4 against Mahindra United in a National Football League match at the Cooperage here Thursday. It was Mohammedan Sportings third straight loss of the tournament.

Felix Abogaye brought the Mumbai outfit back on level terms in the 23rd minute, heading in a Covan Lawrence free-kick. The teams went into the breather with the score 1-1. Mohammedan Sporting could have taken the lead in the 49th minute but Chidi Edeh was intercepted in time by Mahindra custodian Kalyan Chowbey. The hosts straight away took the lead following the counter attack that resulted. Striker Raphael Patron Akakpo lobbed over an advancing custodian Bivash Ghosh to make it 2-1. Ten minutes later, Mahindra skipper Khalid Jameel increased the lead with a long ranger. In the 64th minute, Mahindra substitute Abhishek Yadav shot over from close. In the 70th minute, Edeh made it 2-3 for the Calcutta team, but Yadav made up for his earlier lapse heading in an Akakpo cross. With just ten minutes to go for the final whistle, a penalty was awarded to Mohammedan Sporting when Rahim Nabi was brought down inside the box by Chowbey. Striker Dipendu Biswas reduced the margin from the spot.  Dempo win 2-0 Sunday Seah and Mohammed Gafaris first-half strikes propelled Dempo to a convincing 2-0 win over Indian Bank in Margao. Dempo took the lead in the 15th minute when Gafari relayed the ball to Clifford Miranda who squared it to Sunday Seah. The latter unleashed a left-footer that beat keeper Felix Edward. Gafari made it 2-0 with a fierce shot off a Seah pass. Indian Bank tried hard to get back into level terms but paid for some poor finishing. Joseph was unlucky in the second half when his shot hit the upright. Dempo now have six points with two wins and a loss while Indian Bank are still to open their account. (PTI)  Copyright

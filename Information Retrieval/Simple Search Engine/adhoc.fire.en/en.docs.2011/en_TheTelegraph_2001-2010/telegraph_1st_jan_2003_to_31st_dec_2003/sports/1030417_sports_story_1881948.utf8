 Arbitrator to rule on Warne
 WARNE: May be spared for charity ties Sydney: An independent arbitrator will decide whether disgraced cricketer Shane Warne can play in charity and testimonial matches while serving a 12-month ban for doping. The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) initially ruled that Warne would not be allowed to play in any organised matches while suspended. However, the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) is challenging the ACBs finding, saying it believes Warne should be free to play in charity and testimonial games. The two organisations have a Memorandum of Understanding governing the relationship between the ACB, ACA and contracted players, but with both parties unable to agree they have referred the matter to an independent body to decide. The ACB and ACA have agreed to seek an independent arbitrator who, once appointed, would determine the arbitration process and timing, the ACB and ACA said in a joint statement on Wednesday. The ACB and ACA are discussing approaching the Law Institute of Victoria post-Easter for a recommendation on suitable arbitrators. The ACB said it had agreed to allow Warne to train with club, state and national teams during his suspension, as well as taking part in coaching and promotional clinics, school promotions, junior development programs and working as a media commentator. The leg-spin bowler was banned for 12 months after testing positive for diuretics which he admitted taking just before this years World Cup. Warne, appearing on a television show shortly after the joint announcement, said he was trying not to think about cricket during his enforced ban. Im forgetting about cricket for the next few months and watching a bit of (Australian Rules) footy, he said. As the cricket season starts up, I will start getting back into cricket.

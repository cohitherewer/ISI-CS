The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Souravs session with local bowlers
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: A long, hard season is over, and its time to move ahead for the Indian captain. Sourav Ganguly sat down with the Bengal bowlers Friday at the Pankaj Gupta indoor centre to discuss the training schedule for the forthcoming season. The bowlers attending the India captains briefing were Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Ranadeb Bose, Sabir Ali, Sanjeeb Sanyal and Shibshankar Paul. The captain discussed the fitness programmes and said he will resume training in June, after returning from a holiday trip to the UK. Ranadeb, however, will be unavailable in June, as he will be playing in England at that point of time. EB apologise East Bengal club formally apologised to the CAB for the misbehaviour of one of their officials during their J.C. Mukherjee Trophy match on April 23. In a letter signed by club secretary Kalyan Majumdar, the club said it will try to ensure that similar things do not happen again in future. The official had entered the umpires room during Day I of their J.C. Mukherjee Trophy semi-final and threatened them.  Copyright

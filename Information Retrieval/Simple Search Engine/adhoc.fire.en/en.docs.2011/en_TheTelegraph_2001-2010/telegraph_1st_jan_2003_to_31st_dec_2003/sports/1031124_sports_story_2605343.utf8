				 																																	St Johns: West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) officials are defending a rise in ticket prices for British fans attending Englands tour of the Caribbean next year, saying the higher cost fits the market and is in line with rates in other regions.				 																																	Tickets that previously would have cost $ 300 per Test match will now cost about $560 per match for English fans, officials said on Sunday.				 																																	The appointed contractor selling the tickets in Britain made the decision due to strong demand, said Derrick Nicholas, the boards operating officer. It is bringing the price of tickets in the West Indies in line with what it obtains in the rest of the world, he said. In a statement, the WICB said it has rejected accusations of profiteering on the sale of tickets in the UK.				 																																	Tim Lamb, chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, said in a statement that English officials were extremely unhappy about the situation, about which there was no prior consultation.				 																																	Durban: Taking a cue from their English counterparts, the United Cricket Board of South Africa has decided to introduce 20-over cricket matches to boost spectator support for the game in the country.				 																																	The plan, according to UCB, will be put into operation in April next year once the details were ironed out.				 																																	The 20-over matches, to be played under flood lights, will be similar to the Twenty-Twenty cricket already experimented with by the England and Wales Cricket Board.				 																																	South Africas top national players would be involved in about 16 matches. The new competition will start as soon as the national team returns from a tour of New Zealand early in April next year.				 																																	Leeds: Leeds caretaker boss Eddie Gray has issued a grim warning for whoever becomes the clubs next permanent coach  relegation and the financial meltdown that would follow are firmly on the cards.				 																																	Gray had been hopeful he could make Leeds harder to beat than they had been under previous manager Peter Reid.				 																																	But a 0-2 defeat at home to Bolton in his first game in charge on Saturday underlined how difficult it will be to drag the club out of the mire, regardless of who is sitting in the coachs office. Southampton boss Gordon Strachan is seen as the favourite and did nothing to dampen speculation on Saturday by refusing to comment on the issue.				 																																	Park City (Utah): American Bode Miller won the mens World Cup giant slalom here Saturday, capturing the second race of the 2003-04 season ahead of Austrians Andreas Schifferer and Hans Knauss. With a total time of 2:20.84, Miller earned his second victory in as many races, after launching his season with a victory in a giant slalom at Solden, Austria.				 																																	He now boasts five giant slalom triumphs among his eight career World Cup victories. Miller, second behind Knauss after the first  leg, finished nearly one second ahead of Schifferer (2:21.70),  with Knauss relegated to third exactly one second behind  the winner at 2:21.84.

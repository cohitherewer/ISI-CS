 Ronaldo: Sex isnt everything
 Ronaldo in Kunming on Thursday. (AFP) Kunming: World Footballer of the Year Ronaldo says sex isnt everything and hes got no complaints about abstaining for two weeks while on a tour of Asia. However, the superstar was clearly flummoxed by the question from a Chinese reporter and was heard muttering: This is tasteless. He recovered his composure to say he would make up for lost time when he got back to Madrid. Well, were all professionals and were working and only thinking about getting ready and thats it, he said. We have plenty of time for sex and we have all our lives for that and two weeks is not going to kill us. Im sure well make up for lost time. At the World Cup last year, the Real Madrid striker admitted that scoring both goals in the final had been better than sex. The World Cup is better than sex, he had said. Anyway, the World Cup is only once every four years and sex is not. Talking about his new teammate David Beckham, Ronaldo made it clear hes the more famous face in other parts of the world. If hes more famous here there are places where Im more famous than he is, said the Brazilian. Maybe I have won more titles, and maybe hes more marketable than I am. Beckham has brought with him from Manchester a cult following and has a fanatical fan base in Asia. Ronaldo said he hopes the two click on the field. I follow what I want to do and keep on winning. Im sure Beckham wants to win as well, Ronaldo said. I have been able to see that his passes are really good and I hope that well able to understand each other on the field. (AFP)  Copyright

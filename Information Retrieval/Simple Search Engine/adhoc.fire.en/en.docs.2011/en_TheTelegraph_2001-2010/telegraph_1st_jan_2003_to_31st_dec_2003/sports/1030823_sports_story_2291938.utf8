The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dramatic change on Bhutia front
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung will play his first game on Saturday Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia is set to leave for Kuala Lumpur Friday night to play for Malyasias Perak FC. The star striker, who arrived in the city Friday from Imphal, will turn out for Perak FC in a Malaysian Cup match on Saturday. The AIFF issued the International Transfer Certificate (ITC) to Bhaichung Wednesday. Perak had offered a two-month stint to the player following his performance in the ASEAN Club Championship in Indonesia. East Bengal had initially decided to release Bhaichung only after their match versus Mohun Bagan on September 4. But the contents of the ITC put paid to their hopes. The ITC says he is already a Perak FC player. Now if he is to turn out for East Bengal, the necessary clearance has to be obtained from Perak FC. That is a long drawn process and we decided to release him, said a senior East Bengal official. The AIFF had cleared him to play for Perak after receiving the no-objection from East Bengal and the IFA. Till a few days ago I knew I wasnt going to Malaysia. I am surprised by the sudden turn of events. I hope to be back in the first week of October, Bhaichung said, shortly before leaving for the airport. However, he was all at sea about the clubs standing in the ongoing Malaysian League. I hope to get things going my way, the striker signed off.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tillekeratne for Tests, Atapattu for ODIs
 TILLEKERATNE Colombo: The Sri Lankan selectors on Thursday decided to have separate captains for the Test and one-day sides, naming Hashan Tillekeratne and Maravan Atapattu to assume the two roles. The appointments came in the wake of Sanath Jayasuriyas resignation after Lanka crashed out of the Sharjah four-nation meet in the league stages. The appointments have been made for the two-Test series against New Zealand starting on April 25, and the tri-series following it. Meanwhile, former South African coach Graham Ford has also turned down the opportunity to take charge of Sri Lanka. This has come at a time in my life when I would like to spend an extended period of time with my family, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

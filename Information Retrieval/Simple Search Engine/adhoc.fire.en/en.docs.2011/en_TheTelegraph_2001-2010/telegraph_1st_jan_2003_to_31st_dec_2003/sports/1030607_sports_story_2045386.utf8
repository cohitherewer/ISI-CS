The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fleming wary of Indian turners
 Stephen Fleming feels his boys must utilise the next three months in full for preparation New Delhi: Having served some extremely hostile tracks during the home series last season, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming is worried that the Indians might just return the compliment when the Black Caps come for the return tour in October. Fleming, one of the most successful New Zealand captains, is keen to reverse the trend of not winning a Test series in India. But he knows full-well that the spinning tracks in the sub-continent wont be exactly to their liking. I do worry about the type of pitches we are going to get after what happened in New Zealand earlier this year, Fleming was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Press Association. During their New Zealand tour in December-January, the Indians played on pitches which offered great bounce and enormous sideways movement. India suffered humiliating losses in both the Tests and one-day series with their famed batting line-up failing to cope up with the challenge. Fleming realises that his team faces the prospect of a similar rout against the likes of Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble, if the Indians opt for sharp turning tracks. New Zealand first toured India in 1955-56 under Henry Cave, but a series win has eluded them on the seven occasions over the past 46 years. Fleming, desperate to reverse the trend, is keenly awaiting the outcome of Saturdays BCCI fixtures committee meeting which will decide the venue for the two Tests and the tri-series that follows. Bangalore and Mohali are the front-runners to get the Test matches based on the Boards rotational policy. Aware that the Indians would be gunning to get their revenge, Fleming stressed on the fact that his side must utilise the next three months on preparing for this important series.  (PTI)  Copyright

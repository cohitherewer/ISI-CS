The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nigerian to join Bagan
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will sign Nigerian defender Akuneto next week. A top Mohun Bagan official said coach Aloke Mukherjee has given his nod, which has prompted them to take the decision. We want him for the Federation Cup. Whether he continues thereafter, will be decided on the basis of his performance in the Federation Cup. It was also said that Akuneto will be tested in a couple of Super League games before the Federation Cup gets off. The Nigerian has been practising with the team since last week. Meanwhile, Jose Ramirez Barreto lashed out at referee Udayan Halder. This is not football. The foul could easily have ended my season, an angry Barreto said after the match. Barreto was fouled by Ali Reza during their match against Mohammedan AC. Both Barreto and Reza were shown yellow cards by the referee. The refereeing was nothing short of ridiculous. Referees like these are killing the game, he said.  Copyright

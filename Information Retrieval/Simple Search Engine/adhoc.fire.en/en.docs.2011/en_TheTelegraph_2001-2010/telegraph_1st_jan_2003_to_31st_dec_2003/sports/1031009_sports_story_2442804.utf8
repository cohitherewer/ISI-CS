The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Great exposure for Bengal duo 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: India failed to make the final of the Emerging Nations Trophy, but for the Bengal duo of Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Sourashish Lahiri, the meet gave great exposure. While Shukla played in all four games, Lahiri got a chance in only two, one of them being washed out. It was a good experience as we got to play with the most talented players of the sub-continent, Shukla said. He produced a match-winning unbeaten 40 against Pakistan in the final league game. Dilip Vengsarkar, the chief Talent Research Development Officer was there in Sri Lanka and he told me to keep up the good work, especially with not too many allrounders around, Shukla added. The fact that both opening bowlers from the team  Avishkar Salvi and L. Balaji  have made it to the India squad for the first Test against New Zealand doesnt disappoint the Bengal allrounder. In fact, its an added motivation. A few more chances and I can be right up there, Shukla, who last played for India in 1999 (ODIs), said. Lahiri on the other hand, hardly got a chance to bowl. But these opportunities give you the confidence for the future. There will be more chances and I will try to cash in on them, he said.  Copyright

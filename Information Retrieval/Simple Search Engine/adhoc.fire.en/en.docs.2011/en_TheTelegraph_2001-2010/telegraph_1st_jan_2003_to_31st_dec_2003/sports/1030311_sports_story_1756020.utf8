				 																																	Islamabad: Former cricketing great Javed Miandad is seeking an audience with President Pervez Musharraf to discuss plans to rebuild the team after Pakistans dismal performance in the World Cup.				 																																	One of these days I will speak to Gen. Musharraf if I get an opportunity, Miandad said. And Miandad may be planning to put his head on the chopping block again and offer his services as a coach though he has not been sounded yet, according to sources.				 																																	No one has said anything to me, Miandad was quoted as saying by the daily The News. 				 																																	He has not rested in peace ever since the teams thrashing at the hands of India and early exit from the World Cup, calling for a change of approach by the board and the players during the past few weeks. 				 																																	Miandad was apparently all the more disappointed by the reluctance of the senior players to quit the game owning responsibility for the dismal show and felt the board should decide on behalf of the veterans.				 																																	Durban: A man has been arrested for making a bomb threat outside the stadium in Bloemfontein during the Super Six match between New Zealand and Zimbabwe, police sources said Monday.				 																																	The man wanted to drive down a closed street near the Goodyear Park stadium on Saturday. When he was denied entry, he allegedly grabbed a security guards two-way radio, shouted that he had planted four bombs at the Bloemfontein airport and drove away, the sources said.				 																																	A police team gave him a chase and the mischief-maker was nabbed. A search at the airport revealed no bombs, the sources said adding the man would be produced in court Monday.				 																																	Johannesburg: Those who wanted to watch the World Cup but were dissuaded by house full notices by the organisers, do not despair.				 																																	There is plenty of room available in the various stadia in South Africa, thanks to the home teams early exit from the tournament.				 																																	None of the three Super Six matches played up to Saturday drew capacity crowds with the New Zealand-Zimbabwe game at Goodyear Park in Bloemfontein on Saturday attracting just 2,000 spectators.				 																																	Tickets were freely available for Mondays high-profile match between India and Sri Lanka at the Wanderers here, a game South Africa were billed to play.				 																																	London: Organisers of the 2007 World Cup are so keen to conquer new frontiers that they are set to stage some matches in the US with Disney World tipped to be a venue.The tournament organisers are going to invite bids from countries and islands which want to host matches in 2007 and America is in with a shout for some of those games, ICC spokesman Mark Harrison said.				 																																	n Australia vs New Zealand live on Max from 1.30 pm n India vs Sri Lanka highlights on Max from 8.30 am n India vs Kenya highlights on Max from 10 am n Taking Guard on ESPN from 12.30 pm

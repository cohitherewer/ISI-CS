The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla face the firing squad
 Bangladesh players during a training session at Marrara Oval on the eve of their first Test against Australia in Darwin on Thursday. (AP) l Crocodile land set for debut: S2 Darwin: What pundits are billing as potentially the greatest mismatch in Test history gets underway on Friday when mighty Australia take on minnows Bangladesh, officially the worlds worst team. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore was fuming on the eve of his sides first-ever Test against Australia when asked if he was confident the match would last more than two days. Whatmore, who took charge last month of Test crickets newest nation, took a few seconds before replying absolutely and after the interview at Marrara Oval took exception with the radio reporter over her question. 			Bangladeshs modest record of 19 Tests for 18 losses and a rain-affected draw since debut in 2000 has pundits declaring a rout of spectacular proportions. David Hookes has even said there is potential for the five-day Tests to turn into one-day events with a flurry of records. The Australian team has not been part of the public denigration of the Bangladeshi novices, speaking of their respect for the developing Asian team. Captain Steve Waugh, a great cricket traditionalist, has called the outpourings of scorn as sledging by the media. Theres been a lot of rubbish written over the last couple of weeks about this Test match, Waugh said. These guys are capable cricketers. Theyve won two games on tour so far. Theyve played 19 Test matches as a country, its not going to be a walkover, were going to have to play good cricket. Theyre developing and they havent won a Test match yet. They have to start somewhere and it doesnt do them any good to continually read a lot of what has been in the papers and around the place. Theyre much better than whats been written. The Australian captain said his team was working on cleaning up its much-criticised sledging reputation. As a general rule the team is pretty well behaved on the field, Waugh said. The teams we play respect us and we respect them, occasionally things do happen but were trying to rectify that. We have some things to work on, weve talked about that for the last couple of years, but occasionally things get out of control, he said.

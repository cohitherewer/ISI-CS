 Salvi, Jaffer ensure Mumbai win
Mumbai: Speedster Avishkar Salvi and opening batsman Wasim Jaffer ensured a winning start for Mumbai in their defence of the Ranji Trophy this season. While Salvi ripped through Barodas middle-order with a four-wicket haul to dismiss the visitors for 270, Jaffer remained unbeaten on 86 off 114 balls as Mumbai notched up the five-wicket win and four points in the Elite Group A match. Baroda, who had conceded a 111 run first-innings lead, resumed at their overnight score of 219 for four but lost Tushar Arothe early to a Salvi outswinger. Nayan Mongia was dismissed the next ball, edging one to slips. Although Rakesh Patel denied Salvi the hattrick, Salvi paved the way for his teams win trapping Ajit Bhoite (10) plumb in front of the stumps. Set to get 160 runs in 160 minutes and 15 mandatory overs, the hosts made heavy weather of the run chase. But Jaffer held forte and ensured the victory in the first mandatory over. In another match, Tamil Nadu notched up a memorable four-wicket away win against Karanataka. Chasing 261, S. Sharath (57) and J.R. Madangopal (48 n.o.) anchored the Tamil Nadu innings. Tamil Nadu had conceded a first-innings lead, but the fightback ensured four points for the visitors. SUMMARISED SCORES  In Ahmedabad: Hyderabad 272 amp; 185. Gujarat  129 amp; 151 (V.

 Yuvraj rested, say Yorkshire 
London: Yorkshire dropped Yuvraj Singh for the County Championship match against Gloucestershire on Wednesday but the club said the Indian player was simply being rested and would be considered for future matches. Of late, the left-handed batsman has been struggling for form in England. He started off well in the Twenty20 Cup but failed to keep up the momentum in the first-class version and the one-day league. Yuvraj has produced mere 111 runs from eight matches at an average of 15.85 in the County Championship. In the National League, he has done no better with 145 runs from five innings at 29.00.

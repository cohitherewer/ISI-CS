 Hooper pulls out
Bridgetown: Carl Hooper, the former West Indies captain, pulled out of the squad on Monday to face Australia in the home Test series starting on Thursday. A West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) spokesperson said that Hooper, replaced by Brian Lara as captain last month, had changed his mind and would not be playing against the world champions. He had had discussions with the chairman of selectors and said he would play but he has had second thoughts and changed his mind, the spokesperson said. Allrounder Hooper, 36, has played 102 Tests for West Indies with a batting average of 36.46 and 49.42 with the ball. He took over as skipper when Lara stepped down three years ago after West Indies were white-washed on a tour of New Zealand. Australia will play four Tests and seven one-day internationals, starting on April 10.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

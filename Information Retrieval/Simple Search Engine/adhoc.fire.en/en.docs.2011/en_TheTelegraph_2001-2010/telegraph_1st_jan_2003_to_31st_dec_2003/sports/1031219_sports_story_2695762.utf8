 Villa stun Chelsea 
 - LEAGUE CUP - Middlesbrough beat Spurs on penalties  Chelseas Hernan Crespo reacts after missing a chance in their English League Cup quarter final tie against Aston Villa at Villa Park on Wednesday. (Reuters) London: Struggling Aston Villa pulled off a shock 2-1 victory over big-spending Chelsea on Wednesday to reach the semi-finals of the League Cup. Villa will play Bolton Wanderers for a place in the final on February 29 in Cardiff, while Middlesbrough, who beat Tottenham Hotspur 5-4 on penalties in Wednesdays other quarter-final, will play Arsenal. A fantastic goal by Colombian striker Juan Pablo Angel gave Villa a 16th-minute lead, Chelseas England playmaker Joe Cole levelled in the 69th minute but Gavin McCann lashed home the winner nine minutes later after an Angel shot had been blocked. The result was a huge upset, with Villa lying just a point above the relegation zone and third-placed Chelsea challenging for Premier League and Champions League honours. Chelseas squad has been assembled at a cost of 111 million pounds since the July takeover by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and between the starting XI and the substitutes, coach Claudio Ranieri fielded virtually all his best players at Villa Park. More worrying for Chelsea is that Wednesdays setback followed Saturdays first home league defeat of the season, a 1-2 loss to unfancied Bolton. In this period, everything is going wrong for us, Ranieri said. Chelseas problems started when defender William Gallas misjudged a header over 30 metres out. Angel seized possession, dribbled past John Terry and smacked a swerving shot past keeper Neil Sullivan. Substitute Hernan Crespo teed up Chelseas equaliser, knocking the ball back for the on-rushing Cole to steer past keeper Thomas Sorensen. But McCann rifled in the winner and Chelsea were twice denied in the dying minutes when Sorensen saved a Terry header and Cole volleyed into the side-netting.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

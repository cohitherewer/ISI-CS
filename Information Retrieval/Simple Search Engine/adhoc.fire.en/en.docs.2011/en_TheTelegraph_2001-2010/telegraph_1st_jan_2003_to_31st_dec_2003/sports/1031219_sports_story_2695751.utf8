The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harbhajan a bit scared
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Hobart: Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was admitted to a Melbourne facility late on Thursday and will be operated upon early next morning. The surgery, on his right index finger, will be performed by Dr Greg Hoy. Among others, he has treated Shane Warne. Well, I am feeling a bit scared... But, what to do? Jo bhi ho raha hai, career extend karne ke liye ho raha hai, Harbhajan told The Telegraph, when contacted on his cellphone. He added he would be discharged on Friday itself and will wait for Team India to reach Melbourne on Monday. Obviously, the latest MRI wasnt encouraging.  Copyright

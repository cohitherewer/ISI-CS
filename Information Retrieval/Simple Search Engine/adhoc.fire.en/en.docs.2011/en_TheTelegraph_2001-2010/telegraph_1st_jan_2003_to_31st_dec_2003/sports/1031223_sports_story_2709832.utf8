The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wright, Kartik, Shastri walk for a cause
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Melbourne: In an excellent gesture, Team India coach John Wright, Murali Kartik and trainer Greg King joined the Dean Jones-organised Walk for Leukaemia Research for around an hour, on the outskirts of this mega city, on Monday afternoon. Former India captain Ravi Shastri was there too. The objective is to raise funds with Jones target being to reach the MCG on Friday, during lunch on the first day of the third Test. As with other such exercises, the Walk is being held in stages. It was a nice experience... We have an obligation to help noteworthy causes and, really, one quite enjoyed it, Wright told The Telegraph. Apparently, the Anil Kumbles would also have joined, but the teams delayed arrival from Hobart upset some plans.  Copyright

		 Sunday, December 07, 2003  Flame makes it Guineas double 
 BY STAR RACER Darius Aretino at the RCTC on  Saturday. Pictures by Kishor Roychowdhury Calcutta, Dec. 6: Justifying support in the betting, the Darius Byramji-trained filly Psychic Flame claimed the Calcutta 2000 Guineas at the RCTC today. The easy winner of the 1,000 Guineas was, however, pressed by Aretino and it was only half-a-length that separated the two.

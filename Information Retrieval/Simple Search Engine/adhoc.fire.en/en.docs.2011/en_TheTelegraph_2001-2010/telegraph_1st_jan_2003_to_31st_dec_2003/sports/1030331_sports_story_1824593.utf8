The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pakistan claim title 
 Pakistan players exult after beating Germany in the Azlan Shah Cup final in Ipoh Sunday. (Reuters) Ipoh (Malaysia): Pakistan stunned world champion Germany with a slim 1-0 victory to lift the 12th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup Sunday. Shabbir Hussain scored the winning goal eight minutes from time, delivering Pakistan its third victory in the championship after 1999 and 2000. It was a big blow to defending champion Germany who won the tournament in 1987 and 2001.  In an earlier match, New Zealand defeated 2002 Asian Games gold medallist South Korea 3-2 to finish third in the five-nation tournament which started on March 22. Host Malaysia finished at the bottom after losing all their four matches. In the final, Shabbir took advantage of poor defending by Germany to beat goalkeeper Clemens Arnold in a tightly contested match. Pakistan won the fairplay award while Sohail Abbas was judged as the Best Player of the Tournament. Germany had some consolation when Zeller was picked as the most promising player while teammate Arnold was adjudged the Man of the Match. (AFP)  Copyright

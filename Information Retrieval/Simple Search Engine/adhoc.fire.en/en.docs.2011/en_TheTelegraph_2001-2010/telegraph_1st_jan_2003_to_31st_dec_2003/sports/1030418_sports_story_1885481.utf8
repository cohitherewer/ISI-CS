 Ashish Nehra undergoes surgery
		 NehraNew Delhi: Indian fast bowler Ashish Nehra underwent ankle surgery on Thursday in South Africa to correct an injury he suffered during the World Cup. Nehra underwent the operation in a Pretoria hospital, his mother informed. His operation went off well, she said. He spoke to us just now and he is fine. The 23-year-old bowler is expected to take at least a month to recover. He badly injured his left ankle when he slipped and fell on his bowling stride in the World Cup league match against Namibia.

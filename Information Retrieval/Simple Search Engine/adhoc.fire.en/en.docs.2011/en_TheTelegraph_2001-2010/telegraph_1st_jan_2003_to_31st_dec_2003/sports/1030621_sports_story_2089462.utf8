The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak crushed by 7 wickets
 - SECOND ODI l James Anderson first Englishman to claim hattrick  Darren Gough is congratulated by keeper Chris Read after bowling Younis Khan for a duck at The Oval on Friday. (Reuters) London: James Anderson claimed Englands first one-day hattrick and Marcus Trescothick hammered a savage half-century as Pakistan were crushed by seven wickets with an extraordinary 28 overs to spare in the second one-dayer. The 20-year-old Anderson, who had also taken a wicket with the first ball of Fridays match, removed Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami to wrap up Pakistans 44-over innings of 185 at The Oval. Trescothick then tore Pakistans pace attack to shreds, hitting 86 from 55 balls including 76 in boundaries  16 fours and two sixes  in blazing sunshine. The left-hander hammered three boundaries in an over off Shoaib and Azhar Mahmood, and outdid that with four off Sami. He also hit two sixes as England cruised home in 22 overs. Pakistan, who had won the first match of the series, were left trying to make sense of the carnage. Shoaib went for 46 off five overs before redeeming himself with the wickets of Michael Vaughan (10) and James Troughton (0), both caught-behind. 			Shoaib ended with two for 69 from nine overs, while Mahmood conceded 35 off three overs. For Pakistan, there was only one real consolation, Yousuf Youhanas high-class 75 not out. They won the toss and little else as Imran Nazir was dismissed leg before by Andersons first ball. Problems soon intensified when four middle-order wickets fell for 19. Hameed chopped Darren Gough on to his off-stump and Younis Khan edged behind first ball. Youhana, with his 27th ODI half-century, and Mahmood put on 72 before Mahmood fell for 30.

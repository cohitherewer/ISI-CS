 FROM WILLIAM TELL 				 										Bangalore: Ten, three-year-old, fillies will face the starter for the 2,400m Bangalore Oaks, the Ladies Derby, on Friday.

All three are in tip top shape but the one who gets the nod to win is the S. Ganapathy-trainee Our Dynasty. The Razeen-Trois Etoiles daughter, following a long lay-off since her last Mumbai campaign, came out to win impressively. With B. Prakash to partner, she may hold off stablemate Bold Bird and Ching Mai.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2.30pm: Splendid Quest 1.

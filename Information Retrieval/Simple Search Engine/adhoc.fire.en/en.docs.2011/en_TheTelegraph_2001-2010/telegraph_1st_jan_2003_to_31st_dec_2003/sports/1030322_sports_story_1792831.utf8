The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Some stars may skip Bangla meet
 - Durham double role for Jawagal Srinath FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Srinath  Johannesburg: Theres a  possibility that some leading Indian players may make themselves  unavailable for next months tri-series in Bangladesh. Besides  India and the hosts, the tournament will feature South Africa. Nothing is confirmed but, informally,  there has been a discussion in some quarters. However, nothing  will move forward till Sundays World Cup final (against  Australia) is out of the way, a well-placed source told  The Telegraph Friday evening. Its possible that a representation  will be made to Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who is  already in South Africa. Actually, not only the top guns,  just about everybody needs a break.  Meanwhile, quick Zaheer Khan has  denied a report (from England) that he will be turning out  for Warwickshire in the first six weeks of the forthcoming  County season. Ive only been approached to take Shane  Bonds place for the first few weeks. Fact is, the offer  hasnt even reached the negotiation stage, Zaheer informed,  soon after the Indians arrival from Durban. Jawagal Srinath, though, has confirmed  he is heading for Durham  on a short-term assignment   as bowling coach-cum-player, on the lines of Allan Donalds  arrangement with Warwickshire not too long ago. Ill be signing the contract  in a day or two, Srinath said, talking exclusively. If  Zaheer also signs on the dotted line, the county circuit  will (at the start, at least) have four Indians  the others  being Harbhhajan Singh (Lancashire) and Virender Sehwag  (Leicestershire). Incidentally, no decision has  been taken on whether Ashish Nehra will undergo surgery  on his left ankle immediately after the World Cup. Abhi  kuch theek nahin hai, he pointed out. No chartered flight Meanwhile, Sahara India Pariwars  chartered flight (for the benefit of Sourav Ganguly and  Co.) has become a non-starter  owing to the conflict in  the Middle East. Apparently, New Delhi refused permission  as the scheduled refuelling halt was close to an American  base.  Air India, on the other hand,  is running a special flight. Copyright

 Anderson takes four as England have it easy

(Reuters) East London: James Anderson produced the best World Cup bowling performance by an Englishman for 20 years as Nasser Hussains team beat Holland by six wickets in their group A game on Sunday. The 20-year-old Anderson, bowling 10 overs on the reel, recorded career-best figures of four for 25 as the Dutch side were restricted to 142 for nine. But Englands opening performance in the tournament was still rusty, even though they sprinted home after just 23.2 overs of their reply. They had reduced the Dutch side to 31 for five but then failed to wrap up the innings, Tim de Leede leading the Dutch rearguard with an undefeated 58. Nick Knight and Michael Vaughan both made 51 in Englands reply but several batsmen threw their wickets away during the chase. We lacked a bit of a killer punch  obviously we havent got a Brett Lee  but we bowled with great discipline, Hussain said. All credit to the Dutch batsmen, they all got stuck in. It was a good workout. To win in 23 overs against anyone is a good performance. England might have had an even shorter day after putting Holland in. Man-of-the-Match Anderson removed Daan van Bunge, caught by Craig White in the gully off a back-foot drive, with the score on 15 and then trapped Luuk van Troost leg before seven runs later. The Dutch top five had managed just 21 runs between them but de Leede, batting at six marshalled the lower-order superbly. Ian Blackwell, with his left-arm spin, and Craig White, back from a side injury, both chipped in with two wickets each. In reply, Marcus Tescothick, slogged his wicket away after making 12 while van Bunge then caught out Englands batsmen with a mix of good deliveries and rank long-hops. Vaughan brought up the 100 with an on-drive for four, then reached his half-century off 53 balls (8x4). Knight completed his 50 off 56 balls with consecutive fours. Van Bunge, who made 62 in the first match against India as an opening batsman, finished with three for 16 off three overs.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

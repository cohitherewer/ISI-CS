The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Azad may now head selection body
 - Syed Kirmani could replace Brijesh Patel from South; Mumbais Shetty will be new joint secretary  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Ratnakar Shetty  Syed Kirmani Kirti AzadCalcutta: Norths Kirti Azad, a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning XI and a BJP Member of Parliament, appears reasonably placed to be elevated as the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCIs) senior selection committee chairman. The vacancy has surfaced because of Brijesh Patels hospitalisation and must be filled during Saturday-Sundays AGM here. According to The Telegraphs sources, he will most probably be replaced either by Syed Kirmani (also from Karnataka) or Tamil Nadus V.B. Chandrasekhar. Till late on Friday, however, a decision had not been taken by Souths representatives. At the moment, Kirmani has the edge. The outspoken Kirti, of course, has already been a selector for one year. In fact, Brijesh too made the committee during the 2002 AGM. Pranab Roy (East) and Sanjay Jagdale (Central) are certain to get another year, but theres uncertainty over Wests Kiran More as a move is afoot to nominate Yajuvendra Singh. More, though, is confident. For Jagdale, this will be his fourth and last term. Brijesh, who underwent a bypass in Bangalore on Monday, remains in the ICCU at the Narayana Hrudalaya  the doctors decided against moving him out as the expected string of visitors will tire him unnecessarily  and, obviously, cannot travel much in the next six-seven weeks. As is known, that period will see Team India play two Tests and a minimum of six ODIs. Besides, the squad for Australia has to be picked at the end of those six-seven weeks. The BCCI, therefore, needs a chief selector who can criss-cross the country. To move away from the selection committee, the group-driven BCCI is actually set to take a significant step during this AGM. Clearly, the unanimous election of Professor Ratnakar Shetty (a chemistry lecturer in Mumbais Wilson College) as joint secretary will mark the end  for the time being, at least  of only backing a candidate from ones own group. Whatever Prof. Shettys equation with Jagmohan Dalmiya, fact is that Mumbai hasnt been part of the BCCI presidents group. Yet, Dalmiya has risked antagonising some by endorsing the Mumbai joint secretarys candidature. Among the losers is Dalmiya confidant Goutam Das Gupta. All along, Ive maintained Ill respect what the group decides That stays unchanged, he said, sportingly. Still, quite a few feel Dalmiya should either have discouraged Das Gupta at the very start or backed him to the hilt. To be fair to Dalmiya, he had a tough decision to make. By the way, accommodating Prof. Shetty signals the mending of fences with the Sharad Pawar-led Mumbai Cricket Association. Prof. Shetty is the joint secretary there as well. Das Gupta apart, Brijesh and, to a lesser extent, C.K. Khanna, didnt find the ball rolling their way. One understands Karnataka chief K.M. Ram Prasad had a two-hour session with Dalmiya on Friday afternoon, but failed to garner his support for Brijesh being the next joint secretary. Delhis Khanna, it is learnt, was off the blocks pretty early, but eventually reconciled to the chair being occupied by Prof. Shetty. Meanwhile, despite talk that West could propose Baroda president Chirayu Amins name as vice-president from that region, it seems Gujarats Nar Hari Amin will continue. The one definite change, among the vice-presidents, concerns East  Assam minister Goutam Roy will replace former chief minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta. However, Messrs Kamal Morarka (Central), Ranbir Singh Mahendra (North) and S. Ranga Reddy (South) are going to stay on. Among the office-bearers, Dalmiya is just hours away from beginning his third and last year as president, while S.K. Nair will continue as secretary. As for Jyoti Bajpai, the incumbent joint secretary, he will now wear the treasurers hat, which is being passed on by Kishore Rungta. Unless somebody springs a surprise and decides to challenge either Dalmiya or Nair, this AGM will be short on drama and excitement. Come to think of it, the absence of politicking will allow the officials to focus wholly on cricket. Cant complain, can we?  Shivlal manager The ruling group has chosen former India off-spinner and selector Shivlal Yadav as manager for the tour of Australia.  Copyright

 Greig buys Harbhajans hattrick ball
 Bangalore: Top Indian cricketers parted with  some of their memorabilia at an auction for charity here  on Friday night.  Sachin Tendulkars bat attracted the highest bid of  Rs 3 lakh by a cricket enthusiast. Harbhajan Singhs hattrick ball was collected by former England captain Tony Greig for Rs 55,000. Harbhajan recorded his hattrick against Australia at Eden Gardens in March, 2001. Since its going for charity, I dont mind parting with it, Harbhajan said. The proceeds from the Auction Replay and a fund-raising dinner went to a select group of NGOs, including Helpage India, Apnalaya and Fame India. In a nice gesture, India captain Sourav Ganguly collected Anil Kumbles blazer that he used during the 1993 tour of Sri Lanka, at a bid of Rs 25,000. India won that series. Tendulkars gloves went to the son of the late Mark Mascarenhas. Mascarenhas was killed in a road accident in January 2002. Around Rs 6.5 lakh was raised at the auction. (PTI)  Copyright

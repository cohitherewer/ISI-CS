The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Good day in office for Indians
Hyderabad: Eighteen-year-old Pankaj Advani stretched his form further to win a difficult match against Eugene Huges of Republic of Ireland while Rishabh Thakkar and Siddarth Parikh were the other Indians to register victories in the World Billiards Championship on Tuesday. Advani trounced Huges 14-151, 151-96, 150-5, 150-138. Thakkar got the better of John McIntyre (Northern Ireland) 151-86, 151-103, 150-90 and Parikh defeated another Irishman James Moore 151-46, 151-126, 150-71. After losing the first frame to the chubby Irishman, Advani, who recently won the world snooker title, took control of the baize and cued well mostly banking on top table shots to take the second frame. Advani was at his best in the next frame as he notched up the victory mark of 150. In the final frame, Huges fumbled when it mattered most and Advani made it in the next visit to romp home 3-1.

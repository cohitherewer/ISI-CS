The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Double deadlock in city
- Under-19 national league - Hired juniors dish out unpalatable fare  BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The objective of launching the under-19 National Football League (NFL) two years ago was undoubtedly noble. By getting the top-flight NFL teams to compete in the junior championship, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) was trying to build up a pool of players who can be nurtured for the future.But the AIFF alone cant make this venture a fruitful one, it needs full-fledged co-operation from the clubs. And thats the last thing some of the NFL teams are doing, at least on evidence till date.Firstly, no more than nine of the 12 elite division teams have thrown their hat into the ring this time. More significantly, most of the teams have been built on imports.The result is predictable, like the goalless drudgery one witnessed Tuesday afternoon at the East Bengal ground where the NFL champions hosted Tollygunge Agragami. Twenty-two boys  some of whom looked anything but under-19  ran around aimlessly for the better part of 90 minutes, chasing an elusive target.East Bengal, who won the first edition of the meet, didnt have a single home player. Tollygunge Agragami were slightly better on this front, having taken half the team on lien from other clubs.Not surprisingly, a goal never materialised. The fact that the goalkeepers, Somnath Khara and Souvik Mondal, had to collect two feeble shots in the entire match tells its own tale. There was only one occasion, seconds before the final whistle, when a team threatened to score.East Bengals Kishore Mallik, finding himself with just the custodian in front, shot over the crosspiece in haste.I had to shortlist 22 boys from a group of 80 and then I got five days to train them, was how East Bengal coach Tarun Dey justified the insipid performance.JCT miss chancesThe scoreline at the Mohammedan Sporting ground was no different. JCT and Indian Bank were locked goalless in the other group B fixture, but at least there was some action.JCT dominated proceedings and should have earned full points. Raj Kumar Yadav fumbled with goalkeeper at his mercy. Manpreet Singhs header was kicked out of harms way from the goalline by V. Arokiaraj. Then, Surinder Singh failed to get a touch to an inviting Yadav cross, just yards from the goal.Salgaocar win 3-0PTI adds from Margao: In group A action, Salgaocar beat Vasco 3-0 at the Duler ground in Mapusa.Salgaocar, who led 2-0 at half-time, scored through Rajesh Patil (34th minute) and Lector  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jamshedpur edition inaugurated
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: A capacity crowd, music and cultural programmes set the tone Thursday evening at the Michael John auditorium for the fourth edition of The Telegraph schools chess Jamshedpur edition. The record entries for the edition was evident as the crowd that initially started trickling in one and twos soon filled 500-capacity auditorium to the brim. Children, some in school uniform, accompanied by parents started streaming in. State sports minister Sudershan Bhagat was invited but could not make it due to ill health. Since the morning, elaborate preparations had been underway at the J.R.D. Tata Sports Complex. Chess boards, clocks and score sheets were double checked by the officials of the East Singhbhum District Chess Association (ESDCA) and the Tata Chess Centre. ESDCA secretary A.K. Bose said the preparations were almost complete. He added that the participants from Bihar and Chakradharpur have already arrived while most are on their way. A new attraction in this years meet is the entry of 20 tribal chess players from the neighbouring Seraikela-Kharsawan districts. It is the first time that tribals are participating in this meet. It would certainly provide them an opportunity to showcase their talent. We are looking forward to see them in action, Bose added. However, the tribal players hadnt reported till late.  Copyright

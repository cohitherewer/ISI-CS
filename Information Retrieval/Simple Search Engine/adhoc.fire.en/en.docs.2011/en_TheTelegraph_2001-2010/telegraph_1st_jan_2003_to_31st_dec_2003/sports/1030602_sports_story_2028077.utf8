 WI on top despite Lehmann 
St Georges (Grenada): Darren Lehmann hit a century as Australia totalled 247 for eight off their 50 overs in the final ODI against the West Indies on Sunday. The West Indies were 185 for one after 36 overs with Wavell Hinds on 84 and Brian Lara 32. Chris Gayle made 60 as the Aussies headed for a third straight defeat. The 33-year-old Lehmann scored 107 off 109 balls with 10 boundaries and a six. Skipper Ricky Ponting retired hurt after being struck on the hip by Mervyn Dillon. He returned for the final ball but was limping heavily. Chris Gayle took five for 46. Another part-time spinner Marlon Samuels opened the bowling with Dillon. (AFP)  Copyright

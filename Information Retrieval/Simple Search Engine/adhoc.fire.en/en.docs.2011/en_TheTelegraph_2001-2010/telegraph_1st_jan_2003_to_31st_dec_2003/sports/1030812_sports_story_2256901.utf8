The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Andy Moll new Kenya coach
 Tikolo rues lack of contracts Nairobi: Kenyas new cricket coach Andy Moll is hoping to build on the countrys World Cup performance as he sets about helping the team towards their goal of becoming a Test nation. The players must all improve in their own individual ways, improve the team and really thats what Im looking at, Moll, who took over two weeks ago, told reporters at his first training session with players at the Aga Khan Sports Club in Nairobi. (Former coach) Sandeep Patil and (assistant) Andy Kirsten did a great job getting the team up there, and Im coming here hopefully to build on that, he said. Moll, an Englishman who has played for Warwickshire and also coached Free State in South Africa, said he did not feel under pressure following Patils achievement. Patil led Kenya to become the first non-Test nation to reach the World Cup Super Six and semi-finals, beating Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh on the way. As far as Im concerned, that was in the past. They enjoyed it and quite rightfully they celebrated it, but now they will only be remembered for what happens in the future, Moll said. He said he hoped to achieve his goals with the team by bringing in more professionalism, discipline and enjoyment. If we can be professional in everything we do, in our preparations, in the way we play the game and if we enjoy ourselves, I think we can achieve our goals, he said. Kenyan captain Steve Tikolo said the team was likely to be hampered by a lack of player contracts, which expired in June. The Kenya Cricket Association told us they are hoping to get a sponsorship contract done by the end of the month and meanwhile have asked that we get on with training, Tikolo said. But if we are not getting money to pay our bills, it will be difficult to assemble a team. Those like Hitesh (Modi) and Ravindu (Shah) who work elsewhere would rather go and work than come here.

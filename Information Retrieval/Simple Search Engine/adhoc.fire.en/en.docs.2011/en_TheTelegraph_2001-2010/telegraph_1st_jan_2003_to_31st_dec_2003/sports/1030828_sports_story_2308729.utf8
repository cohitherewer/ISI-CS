The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia in hospital with fever
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Striker Bhaichung Bhutia had to be admitted to a Kuala Lumpur hospital with high fever and an upset stomach on Wednesday. Talking to The Telegraph from his hospital bed, Bhutia, who is currently playing for Perak FC, said: I was running a mild fever, but played todays game against Malaka. He added that after the game, the temperature shot up. The club officials rushed me to a local hospital, the striker added. Bhutia, however, felt things arent too bad. I have been given the medication. The doctor in charge believes that if things dont deteriorate drastically, I may be released tomorrow. The striker, however, was instrumental in his clubs 5-0 victory. I was played as a striker and did well, Bhutia said. Though I didnt score any, I set up the third and also had a hand in two other. It was a home game and he quite liked the atmosphere of the 35,000 ground.  Copyright

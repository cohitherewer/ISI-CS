The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Smart Ruler may win again 
 BY STAR RACER Daniel David Calcutta: It may pay to follow the Daniel David-Amyn Merchant combinations in Thursdays race-card. Of the eight events framed, the duo threatens to pick up seven, including the 1,400m RWITC Cup  for horses in the highest class  through their in-form four-year-old Smart Ruler.The well-bred Razeen-Regal Star son has been a seven in-a-row winner before his progress was halted in the 2,000 Guineas in which he placed a good third behind Network and Nationalistic. Back to an open class after doing poorly in other classics, the Daniel-ward returned to the winners enclosure with an impressive show in the 1,600m Governors Cup. In the RWITC Cup there is hope for the opposition as Smart Ruler is out-handicapped. However, going by his style of victory, it may come as a surprise if Merchant is unable to drive Smart Ruler home as a winner.

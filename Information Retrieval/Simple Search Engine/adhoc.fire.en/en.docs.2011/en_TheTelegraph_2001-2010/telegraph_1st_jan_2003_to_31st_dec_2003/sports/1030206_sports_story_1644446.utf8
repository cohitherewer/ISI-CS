 Hooper hits unbeaten century
 Kimberley: West Indies captain Carl Hooper smashed an unbeaten 100 to lift his side to 360 for four in 50 overs against South African province Griqualand West in a World Cup warm-up match on Wednesday. Hooper, who has not played a one-day International since undergoing corrective surgery on his knees in November, hit two sixes and nine fours from only 69 balls, reaching his century with just two deliveries left in the innings. Opener Wavell Hinds weighed in with an 83-ball 96 and Ramnaresh Sarwan hit 80, but Brian Lara, who made 45 two days earlier against Free State, was dismissed for 18 after stroking four boundaries. Sarwan and Hooper shared a fourth-wicket stand of 120 before Sarwan was removed by Deon Kruis, but Ricardo Powell plundered an unbeaten 34 off only 20 deliveries to take his side past 350. West Indies, World Cup winners in 1975 and 1979, begin their campaign against hosts South Africa on Sunday in the opening match of the tournament.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

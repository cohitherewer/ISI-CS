 Arsenal back on top 
London: Arsenal knocked Manchester United off the top of the Premier League on Sunday after Dennis Bergkamp scored the winner in a 1-0 victory over Blackburn Rovers at Highbury. The Dutch forward coolly steered home a cutback by defender Kolo Toure in the 11th minute of a game which Arsenal dominated for long periods. Earlier, two goals from Juan Pablo Angel steered Aston Villa then to a 3-2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

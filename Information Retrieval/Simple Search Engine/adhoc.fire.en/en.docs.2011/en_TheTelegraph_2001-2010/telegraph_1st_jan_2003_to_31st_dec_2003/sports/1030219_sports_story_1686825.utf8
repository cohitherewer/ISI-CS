 Iraq coach fears for players
Berlin: Iraq soccer trainer Bernd Stange believes Germanys high-speed motorways are more dangerous than anything he encountered while working in Iraq and said after fleeing his adopted country that he hoped an idiotic war could be averted. The former East German trainer, who abruptly returned home to Germany from Baghdad at the weekend, said he wanted to get back to Iraq as soon as possible, prayed his players survived a war and wanted to work for peace in the meantime. Stange, whose controversial appointment in Iraq last year caused further tensions to already strained German-US relations, said he was bitter about leaving and angry about the war preparations that meant all his players being called up to the Iraqi army. I dont have any players I can train any more, he said. Im disappointed and bitter because everything started off so well. Im not sure Ill see all my players alive again. The only thing they want is to play football. Forty-six percent of the population in Iraq is younger than 16 years old. Bombs are going to be dropped on these people? At breakfast on Monday a young player told me his greatest wish  Sharon, Arafat, Schroeder, Chirac and Putin should come to Iraq and together with the President prevent war from coming, Stange wrote in his diary, according to excerpts published in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung. Why dont political leaders ever come up with ideas like that? Stange asked.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

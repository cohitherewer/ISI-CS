The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe make it 1-1 
 Ray Price and Tatenda Taibu celebrate the dismissal of Ricardo Powell during the second one-dayer in Bulawayo on Sunday. (Reuters) Bulawayo: Zimbabwes Mark Vermeulen steered his shaky colleagues to victory in a run-starved match at Queens Sports Club here on Sunday to level the five-match one-day series against the West Indies at 1-1. Vermeulen stood firm against Vasbert Drakes, Ravi Rampaul and Corey Collymore while teammates crumbled. He scored a match-winning 66 not out, including 18 fours, which enabled a home team lacking in confidence to scrape past 125. (AFP)  Copyright

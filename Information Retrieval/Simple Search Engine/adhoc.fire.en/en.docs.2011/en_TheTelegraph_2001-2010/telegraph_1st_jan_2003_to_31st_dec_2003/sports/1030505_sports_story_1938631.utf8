The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United champions as Arsenal lose
London: Arsenals reign as English league champions and their hopes of an unprecedented back-to-back FA Cup and League double ended Sunday when they crashed 2-3 at home to Leeds United. Mark Viduka scored the winner in the 88th minute, the result meaning Manchester United were crowned English champions for 15th time without playing. Arsenal had to win to keep alive their hopes of retaining their title but now on 72 points with two matches remaining, cannot overhaul United who have 80 points with one match to play. Leeds went ahead in the fifth minute with a stunning goal. Arsenal equalised after 30 minutes when a 25-m drive from Ray Parlour was deflected on to the post by Leeds keeper Paul Robinson, only for the lurking Thierry Henry to head in the rebound. Leeds regained the lead two minutes into the second half when Ian Harte free-kick put the ball beyond Seamans reach. Arsenals Bergkamp scored in the 63rd minute and Viduka had the final say.

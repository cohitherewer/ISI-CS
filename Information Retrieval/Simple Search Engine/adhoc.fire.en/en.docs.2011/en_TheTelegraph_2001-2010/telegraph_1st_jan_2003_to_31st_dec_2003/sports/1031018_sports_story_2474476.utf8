The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gillespie ruled out, Williams in
Sydney: Fast bowler Jason Gillespie was ruled out of Australias tour of India later this month after failing a fitness test on Friday. Brad Williams was named as Gillespies replacement for the triangular one-day series with India and New Zealand. I pulled up sore this morning following a light bowl... and I came to the decision that I shouldnt go to India, Gillespie said. Its not fair on anyone if I went on tour and wasnt 100 per cent fit. Gillespie strained a side muscle in last weeks first Test against Zimbabwe and was ordered to miss the second Test, which started on Friday. The injury-prone paceman was included in a 14-man squad to go to India but only on condition he passed a fitness test. Its fair to say that Im very disappointed but with the right rehabilitation Im confident that Ill be available for the Test series against India in December. Gillespie is the third Australian player to pull of the tour, following injured paceman Glenn McGrath and middle-order batsman Darren Lehmann. The world champions leave for India on October 22. The tournament will be held from October 23 to November 18.

Sydney: In an effort to provide better life to the under-privileged children of Udayan, Australian Test skipper Steve Waugh has launched a unique on-line fund raising Art Union directed at cricket lovers in India and Australia. The Steve Waugh Udayan Art Union, to run till October 31, will provide an opportunity to the Indian and Aussie public to buy tickets costing A$10 via one of the websites  baggygreen.com.au, hungama.com, indiafm.com, cricinfo.com, cricketnext.com and yahoo.com.au. The winner will enter a draw for the prizes which include a seven-day trip for two to Australia for Indian fans to witness the first Test in Brisbane from December 4 to 8 and a meeting with Steve who would give away a signed bat. If the winner is an Aussie, he will be entitled to a seven-day holiday for two people to India for the final of the triangular series in Calcutta on November 18. The winner will also have the opportunity to meet Michael Bevan and be presented with a bat signed by Steve. Waugh said: I encourage all cricket lovers in India and Australia to buy a ticket for a chance to win the ultimate cricket trip and to meet me or my good mate Michael. If we all pull together, we can make a difference to the lives of the kids at Udayan. (PTI)  Copyright

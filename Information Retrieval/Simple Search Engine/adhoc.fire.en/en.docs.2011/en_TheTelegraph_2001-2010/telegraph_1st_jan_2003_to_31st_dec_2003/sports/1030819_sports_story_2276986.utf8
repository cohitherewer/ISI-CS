 IFA sends demands charter to govt
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The IFA has approached the state government for a ground and a stadium dedicated for football, but Salt Lake Stadium is not what the state body is looking at. In a letter to the chief minister on Monday, the IFA presented a four-point charter of demands. First on the list is an appeal to grant the IFA two grounds close to each other. One of these grounds will be used by the states various age-group teams, while the IFA wants to use the other for an academy it wants to set up. According to IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, these two grounds can be obtained in Salt Lakes CA block. He ruled out taking Salt Lake Stadium on lease, simply because it will be too expensive. The IFA has also urged the government to expedite the process of handing over a plot of land in the Maidan area, which was allotted to the state body in 1978. Of the 246 IFA-affiliated units, a huge majority doesnt have a tent. If we get the area for a tent, we can extend our help to these units, said Dutta. The third IFA demand is to earmark the proposed stadium at Rajdanga (on Kasba-EM Bypass connector) for football. The state body wants that stadium as an alternative venue for national and international matches. Till that stadium is built, the IFA is willing to make do with Rabindra Sarobar Stadium. But we want facilities over there to be upgraded, said Dutta. The IFA alsowants a revamp of the Salt Lake Stadium. It includes an urge to relay the turf, upgrade its drainage system.  Copyright

 Healy tips for Warne
 Healy thinks Warnes international comeback will be difficult Brisbane: Former teammate Ian Healy has urged Shane Warne to put his personal issues behind him so he can be remembered for his cricket skills rather than a catalogue of sex scandals. According to Healy the leg-spinner cant expect to walk into the Test team when his 12-month drug suspension ends in February. Healy also said Warne should not entertain thoughts of retirement in the wake of the latest sexual affair allegations. I hope not because then he will be remembered solely for the last 12 months, Healy said on Tuesday. He needs to clear his head and the harder it gets for him the clearer his cricket focus will become and hopefully he will give us two good years of cricket, whether its for Victoria or Australia. Hopefully, he can have a crack at being remembered for what cricketers will remember him for, his great skills. Healy , who commentated on television with Warne during Australias recent home series with Bangladesh, believed his former teammate could triumph over adversity but warned he faced stiff competition. You couldnt say he would come back and slot back into the team with the good form of Stuart MacGill. He might never get back in the Australian team, that doesnt bother me as long as he plays some good cricket for Victoria... That will be enough. Warne left with his family on Saturday for London to get away from intense scrutiny over his private life. (AFP)  Copyright

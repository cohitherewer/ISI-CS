 Surya upset
Kozhikode: Double Grandmaster norm-holder Tejas Bakre upset GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly in the 20th round of the national A chess championship here on Wednesday to remain in contention for a place in the Indian side for the Olympiad. Ganguly, however, maintained his lead. His margin is now reduced to just half a point after GM P. Hari Krishna and GM Sandipan Chanda. Chanda overpowered Suvrajit Saha in a Sicilian Nazdorf game.

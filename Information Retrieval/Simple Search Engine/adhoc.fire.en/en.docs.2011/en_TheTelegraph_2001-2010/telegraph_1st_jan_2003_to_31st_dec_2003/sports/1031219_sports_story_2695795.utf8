The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Nassiri begins with Churchill test
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Jamshed Nassiri with his wards on the first day of his new assignment with Mohammedan Sporting Calcutta: As Jamshed Nassiri embarks on his toughest coaching assignment, an uneasy thought would surely have crossed the Iranians mind: can he do what Mohammed Habeeb and Shankar Moitra couldnt (read: please the Mohammedan Sporting officials)? The hotshot striker of the 80s was handed charge of the team on Wednesday and got just a day with the players before they take on Churchill Brothers in a National Football League match on Friday. Without doubt, its a tough ask for Nassiri who understandably refuses to talk negative. This very team had done quite well at the start of the season They are a bunch of good footballers who I am sure can get back their original form with proper guidance, said Mohammedan Sportings third coach of the season. Its a challenge for me and Ill try to do the job expected of me. Having earned their first point of the League the other day  courtesy a draw with Vasco  after three defeats, Mohammedan Sporting will be keen to make the home advantage count. The onus will be on strikers Edeh Chidi, the Nigerian, and Dipendu Biswas to make use of the chances that come their way. Churchill, having logged seven points from their first three games, suffered their first loss three days ago, against East Bengal, though they believed they were done in by some poor refereeing. Coach Marcus Pacheco, sans any injury or expulsion worry, has a problem of plenty. Nigerian medio John Kingsley will be eligible to play after a one-game suspension and Pacheco is not sure who to drop.  Copyright

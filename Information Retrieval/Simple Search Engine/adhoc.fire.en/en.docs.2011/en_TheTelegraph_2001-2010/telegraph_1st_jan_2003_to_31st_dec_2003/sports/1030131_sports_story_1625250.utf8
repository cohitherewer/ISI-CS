		 Friday, January 31, 2003 				 Salgaocar climb to 4th
				 	 seah: First strike																								Margao: Salgaocar scored a 2-0 win over a depleted Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to move to fourth spot in the 7th edition of the OIL-PSU National League at the Nehru Stadium here on Thursday.																								Salgaocar, who led 2-0 at half time, scored through Sunday Seah (4th) and Samson Singh (40th). Salgacoar now have 19 points from ten matches while HAL are 11th with four points.																								The home team dictated terms right from the start with swift short passes and took the early lead when a forward pass from medio Dharamjit Singh to Seah saw the latter send the ball into the net from inside the box.																								Salgaocar attacked with more vigour after the goal. They camped in the rival half more often and increased the lead five minutes before the interval when a cross by Man of the Match Jitin Bist from the right was headed in by Samson Singh even as keeper Marks desperate attempt failed.																								A depleted HAL failed to put up any resistance. Plenty of mispasses helped Salgaocar to probe more often into the rival half and they could have led by bigger margin had Seah, Samson and Climax Lawrence capitalised on the chances that came their way.																								Referee Suresh showed yellow cards to Salgaocars Rasaq, Climax and HALs Onyia Obinna.  (PTI)

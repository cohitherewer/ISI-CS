The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deep keeps fingers crossed
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta may just have sealed his place in the Australia-bound squad, but the wicketkeeper-batsman is keeping his fingers crossed. I am happy at being named among the probables but will not take anything for granted till the final selection is made on Saturday, Deep told The Telegraph before boarding a flight to Bangalore to participate in Bengals Ranji Trophy tie against Karnataka beginning in Bangalore on Saturday. He is, however, grateful to the team management for keeping faith in his abilities and giving him the chance to make a comeback of sorts after a 21-month break from the national team. Deep feels he is more matured since the time he last played for India against the West Indies in Georgetown. Maybe, at times, I was a bit overawed then. Im more relaxed now, he explains. He wants to forget the last season as a bad dream and thinks was a bit unfortunate in the opening Ranji Trophy encounter against Rajasthan in Jaipur where he had scores of 4 and 0. In the first innings I was out to a brilliant ball and in the second was victim of a bad decision, he said. Nikhil for Devang  Nikhil Haldipur has replaced Devang Gandhi in the Bengal squad for their Ranji Trophy tie against Karnataka in Bangalore from Saturday. Devang pulled out at the last minute citing family reasons. The squad left for Bangalore in the evening.  Copyright

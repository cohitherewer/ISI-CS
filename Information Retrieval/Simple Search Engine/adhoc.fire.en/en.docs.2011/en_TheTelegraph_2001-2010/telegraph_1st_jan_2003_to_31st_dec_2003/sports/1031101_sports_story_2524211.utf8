The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shane Bond fit to fire
Auckland: New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond has shaken off a serious back injury and is raring to take on the touring Pakistan and South Africa sides over the summer. The back feels 100 per cent, Bond told Television New Zealand website on Friday. There are no real limitations in what I can bowl. I could bowl 20 overs one day and then back it up with another spell the next day. Former policeman Bond, 28, burst to prominence as an unknown replacement on the tour of Australia in 2001-02. He injured his back during New Zealands May tour of Sri Lanka. It was his second major injury, coming just over a year after suffering a foot complaint that had kept him out of the series against England in 2002 just after his success in Australia. Meanwhile, Nathan Astle, whose small tear in his left knee tendon forced him out of the one day series against India and Australia, is undergoing a strengthening programme over the next six to eight weeks.

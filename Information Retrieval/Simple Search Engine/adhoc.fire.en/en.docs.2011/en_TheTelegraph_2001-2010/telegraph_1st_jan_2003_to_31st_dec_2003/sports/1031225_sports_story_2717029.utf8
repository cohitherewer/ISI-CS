The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ODI team selection now on Sunday
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Indian squad for the tri-series in Australia beginning next year will be picked on Sunday instead of Friday. It has been learnt that the selectors want to give the India A players a few more matches in the Asian A Championship before finalising the squad. The Indian ODI squad for the meet also involving Australia and Zimbabwe will include either 15 or 16 players since it will be a long trip. As things stand now, Sadagopan Ramesh, Deep Dasgupta, Akash Chopra and Irfan Pathan will be excluded from the 16 currently in Australia for the Test series. According to indications, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif and Hemang Badani are certain to make the cut, and if the squad does include a 16th player, the fight will be between Sanjay Bangar and Dinesh Mongia. The last few ties of the tri-series involving A teams are going to be crucial. Selection committee chief Syed Kirmani said he and his colleagues will try to get in touch with the Indian team management in Melbourne before the start of the third Test on Friday. Only they can say whether we need 15 or 16 players.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, June 28, 2003  Prince Valiant has edge at weights 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 R. Byramji				 										Bangalore: The three horses most likely to be involved in a fighting finish for the 1,400m Karnataka Sub-Area Cup, on Saturday here, are Prevalence, Imperial Legend and Prince Valiant.				 										Going by their workouts, all three look to have benefited from their previous runs and it could be anybodys race. However, the one who is tipped to come out victorious with a thin edge is the Rashid Byramji-ward Prince Valiant who will be assisted by C. Alford in the saddle. Enjoying a slight weight advantage, he may earn his long awaited winning bracket.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2.30 pm: Dark Shadow 1. Crystal Hill 2.

 Gilchrist inspires Wallabies
Sydney: Australias rugby team is drawing inspiration from their cricketing counterparts as they bid to equal their achievement of winning the World Cup. The cricket side, which won the World Cup in South Africa earlier this year, returned home on Thursday from another triumphant tour in India where they defeated the home side and New Zealand in a one-day triangular tournament. The two sides have been in regular contact during the long rugby World Cup campaign which started on October 10 and Wallabies coach Eddie Jones said the players were very close. The guys are good mates with a lot of cricketers and theyve had phone calls from India and messages from other cricketers around the place, Jones said. Wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist and the Wallabies are mutual fans, and Jones revealed they had used a column Gilchrist wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald to help keep their focus throughout the tournament. While not for a moment suggesting Im a Rugby Union expert, I believe there are several basic values that any team must embrace to win the games ultimate prize, whether it be rugby, cricket or any team sport; belief in your process, trust in each other and a never-say-die attitude in every player, Gilchrist wrote. These values are crucial because there is no guarantee that the best side in the world will necessarily win the World Cup. Its about winning the crucial moments that arise throughout a match or a tournament. Jones said they had discussed the article at team meetings, and believed it referred to creating the best opportunity to win the World Cup, which his side had done.  (AFP)  Copyright

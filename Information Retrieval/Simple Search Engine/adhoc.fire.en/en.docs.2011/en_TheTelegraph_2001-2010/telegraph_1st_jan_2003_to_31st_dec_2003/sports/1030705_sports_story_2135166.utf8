The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC wants probe on hold
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has taken initiative to put a temporary brake on the conflict between the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Global Cricket Corporation (GCC), official rights holders of the ICC events. The BCCI, during its working committee meeting, charged GCC with poor marketing of the World Cup 2003 and intended to initiate a probe into the latters role. However, in a press release, forwarded to The Telegraph late Thursday night, ICC president Ehsan Mani said that he had discussed the issue with the BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya and it was agreed that no action would be initiated by the BCCI at the present time. A BCCI official, when contacted, admitted that Mani called up Dalmiya Thursday night after the BCCIs working committee meeting in New Delhi and the matter was discussed. The ICC is dealing with the claims made by GCC and the matters being disputed are contractual ones between the ICC and GCC. On this basis, I have agreed with Mr Dalmiya that the BCCI will not make any claims against GCC or initiate any investigations into its activities at the present time, Mani said. Mani further welcomed Dalmiyas gesture of interacting with the ICC in resolving the outstanding contractual issues. GCC has made a claim against the ICC for damages arising from the World Cup 2003 and the ICC is currently developing a comprehensive response to the GCCs claim, Mani noted.  Copyright

(AFP) New York: World No. 1 Kim Clijsters overcame third seed Lindsay Davenport shrugged off injury fears as two of the tournament favourites booked safe passage into the second round of the US Open on Monday. American Davenport stormed through with a 6-1, 6-0 demolition of Belgiums Els Callens (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). Clijsters began her bid for a first career Grand Slam title in emphatic style by taming American wildcard Amber Liu 6-2, 6-3. They were joined in the winners circle by Clijsters boyfriend and mens sixth seed Lleyton Hewitt. Champion here in 2001, Hewitt crushed Romanias Victor Hanescu 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. The Australians one-sided victory followed an emotional farewell by Pete Sampras, champion here last year. Eighth-seeded American Chanda Rubin crumbled in the first round 4-6, 4-6 to Venezuelan Maria Vento-Kabchi.  It was just a really bad day for me, said Rubin. I just didnt play with enough glue, with enough consistency. I really didnt concentrate well enough.

In the mens draw, third seed Juan Carlos Ferrero beat Czech Jan Vacek 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 but ninth seed Sebastien Grosjean and 17th seed Tommy Robredo fell.

Former finalist Greg Rusedski of Britain lost a marathon match 4-6, 6-4, 2-6, 7-5, 4-6 to Frenchman Gregory Carraz.  (Reuters)  Copyright

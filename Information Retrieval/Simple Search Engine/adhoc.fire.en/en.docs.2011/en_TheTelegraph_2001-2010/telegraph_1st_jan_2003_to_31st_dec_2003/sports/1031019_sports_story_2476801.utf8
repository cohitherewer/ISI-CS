The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shoaib banned for one Test, two ODIs
 Shoaib found guilty of using bad language Lahore, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Pakistans Shoaib Akhtar has been banned for one Test and two one-day Internationals after being found guilty of breaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) Code of Conduct. Match Referee Clive Lloyd said on Saturday that Shoaib would miss the second Test against South Africa and the first two one-dayers against New Zealand in November. A charge was brought by the South African team after an incident involving Shoaib and Paul Adams towards the end of the first day of the first Test on Friday. Shoaib was found guilty of using bad language. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said from Islamabad that it has filed an appeal with the ICC against the ban. The appeal has been filed because we believe we have a strong case, PCB spokesperson Haroon Rasheed said in a brief statement. We are disappointed with the decision and surprised that the incident has been blown out of proportion, the PCB statement read. The appeal has been submitted with video footages. I think there have been more serious offences in this series that have gone unnoticed, Rasheed said. Rasheed has also filed a three-page appeal to the ICC. It is a very argumentative and balanced letter, PCB sources said on the condition of anonymity. The PCB was also planning to submit video footages concerning South African Andrew Nel during the fourth and fifth one-day Internationals in Rawalpindi. Nels behaviour, gestures were of more serious nature than that of Shoaib Akhtar who has not been picked by the stump microphones. In addition to this, Shoaib was more than a dozen yards away from the batsman while Nel had almost put his mouth into Shoiab Maliks mouth, sources in the PCB said. The Pakistan management further argues that medically the fast bowlers utter words because their blood pressure is on a high after they come sprinting from 25-30 yards. Thats precisely why there are more confrontations and clashes in the game of hockey and football because the blood pressure of the players is not normal to that of a common man. Even in cricket, the spinners dont pass on remarks because their blood pressure remains normal. The Pakistan management has also expressed its displeasure in South Africa making an issue off a non-issue. Everyone knows how this series has been rescued. And to make it a success, we went out of our way to help, support and give comfort to the tourists. So much so, we even ignored the Yousuf Youhana incident during the second ODI for which we were severely criticised by our people.  Lloyd urges restraint I have been disappointed in the behaviour of both teams during this series and I would urge the coaches, captains and managers to get their players together and remind them of the importance of playing in a professional manner, Lloyd said on Saturday. Cricket is a noble game based on honesty, integrity and fair play and if the players cannot comprehend this they should not be playing the game, he added.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kramnik held by Anand 
 kramnik: Keeps lead Linares: Viswanathan Anand drew his fourth round game against Vladimir Kramnik of Russia to remain in the joint second position in the 20th Linares Super Grandmasters meet. With half a point from the board, Kramnik, who has so far played one game more than the Indian, maintained his position at the top with 2.5 points. Anand was second with Hungarian GM Peter Leko, both having had a bye already. They have two points. Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan was also second though he has played one board more. Kramnik, however, could lose the sole lead in the next round when he takes his first of the two allotted byes. After his first round win over Ruslan Ponomariov and a draw in black against Spaniard Francisco Vallejo Pons in the second, Anand, with white pieces, was expected to try harder against Kramnik. But he disappointed by opting for a surprise opening  the Rossolimo Attack. Anand tried a new idea after dismantling blacks pawn structure a little but an alert Kramnik went traded queens that guaranteed a level endgame. The draw was agreed to after just 16 moves. Vallejo Pons played out his third draw. He went for a direct attack against Radjabov with a couple of pawn sacrifices but was thwarted on each occasion. Round IV results V. Anand (2/3) drew V. Kramnik (2.5/4); R. Ponomariov (1/4) drew P. Leko (2/3); F. Vallejo Pons (!.5/3) drew T. Radjabov (2/4); G. Kasparov (1/3) had a bye. (PTI)  Copyright

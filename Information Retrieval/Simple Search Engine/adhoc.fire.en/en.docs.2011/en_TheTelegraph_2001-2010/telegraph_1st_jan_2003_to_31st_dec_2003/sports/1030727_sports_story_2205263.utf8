The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Biswas doubtful vs SBT 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, July 26: Ashim Biswas looks a doubtful starter for Mohun Bagan in their Federation Cup pre-quarter final match against SBT on Sunday. Club sources informed that the striker is still nursing an ankle injury and may not be fielded in the first XI. In the absence of Ashim, Marcos Pareira and Jose Ramirez Barreto are likely to start upfront. Mohun Bagans new Nigerian defender Akuneto will be in the first XI. Captain Rennedy Singh sounded a confident man on match-eve, in spite of the up and down performance in the Super Division so far. SBT is a known opponent. Moreover, some of their top players have moved to Vasco, so we shouldnt have a problem, Rennedy said. He, however, felt that being a knock out match, some pressure will surely be there. But we should cope with it.  Copyright

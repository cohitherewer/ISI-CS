 A learning curve: Ashok
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  A file picture of Ashok Malhotra with Sourav Ganguly Calcutta: After a stint with the India A team, its Ashok Malhotras turn to be with the seniors for the tour of Bangladesh. Though Malhotra will be in sole charge of the side for one game before working as John Wrights assistant once he is back, the former national selector sounded extremely keen. Itll be a good learning curve for me. Im looking forward to working with Wright, the former national selector said. He felt that his stint with India A during the tour of West Indies will be of great help. I have seen the boys from close quarters. So the communication will be much better, he said. Talking about the team, he said: Avishkar Salvi and Gautam Gambhir performed creditably during the tour of West Indies. They are really good potential and Im confident they will live up to that. However, before embarking on the tour, he has to win a final for his team. The former India cricketer plays the CAB senior knock-out final Tuesday for Tapan Memorial. The experience surely is unique, but I bet Ill be a cricketer to the core tomorrow when I play for Tapan, Malhotra said. Malhotra, who made his comeback to the local cricket this season after five years, has played eight matches and has scored one century against Milan Samity in the local league. Manager appointed Meanwhile Goutam Dasgupta will be manager for the Dhaka tour. He was also the manager during the West Indies tour.  Copyright

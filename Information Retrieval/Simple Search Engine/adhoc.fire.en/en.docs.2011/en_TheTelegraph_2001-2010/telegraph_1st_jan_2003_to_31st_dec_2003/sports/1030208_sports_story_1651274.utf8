The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ekeh ensures Bagan win
 ekeh: Late strike Chennai: George Ekeh scored against the run of play to help Mohun Bagan record a 1-0 win over Indian Bank in their first second-leg match of the National Football League Friday. Indian Bank, having lost their three previous matches, looked to be in superb touch with Sri Lankan striker K. N. Jayasuriya leading from the front. They created a number of chances with Jaysuriya and Stanley Festus working in tandem. They came close twice but Bagan custodian Rajat Ghosh Dastidar saved the blushes. Luck also helped Mohun Bagan as the cross-piece came in Indian Banks way. In the first half, Bagan failed to settle down and their much-vaunted attacking line was kept in check. The green-and-maroon brigade pressed for full points, and they were rewarded in the 84th minute. Collecting a pass from Amar Ganguly, Ekeh covered about 20 yards, dodged past both Anandarajan and Noel and beat the custodian Netto with a powerful right-footer. The victory left the Calcutta giants on 21 points from 12 games. JCT-Vasco draw In another NFL match at Ludhiana, JCT held Vasco to a 0-0 draw. The JCT forwards were so tightly marked that neither I.M. Vijayan nor Hardip Gill got any space to manoeuvre. Vasco are on 22 points while JCT have 15 from 12 matches. (PTI)  Copyright

		 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 Henry stars in Arsenal victory
																								London: Thierry Henry scored twice to bring up his 100th goal for Arsenal on Sunday as the English champions romped to a 4-0 victory at Birmingham City.																								A second-half hattrick by Ireland striker Robbie Keane gave Tottenham Hotspur a thrilling 4-3 win over Everton in the days earlier Premier League clash.																								Henry gave Arsenal a sixth minute lead and Robert Pires volleyed the second in the 28th minute to line up the victory.																								Cameroon defender Lauren headed Arsenals third midway through the second half, before Henry swept home his 100th for the club since joining from Juventus in August 1999.																								The resounding victory restored Arsenals five-point lead over Manchester United at the top of the league table.																								Spurs were behind after only 10 minutes of their game and twice squandered the lead before Keanes opportunist final goal gave them a deserved victory after three straight defeats.																								Brian McBride put Everton ahead on his Premier League debut, before Gus Poyet levelled and Keane fired the hosts in front. Steve Watson then equalised for Everton but Keane drilled home a superb low shot from outside the area, only for Tomasz Radzinski to level matters again.																								With seven minutes left and Spurs looking at only a point for all their efforts, Keane pounced on a defensive error to beat the goalkeeper.																								In another match, Aston Villa held Liverpool 1-1. (Reuters)

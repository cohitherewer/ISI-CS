 Five out of six for India
Kozhikode: India capped their fine performance in the Asian Youth Chess meet Friday by winning five of the six gold medals at stake, their clean sweep prevented by a Vietnam player in the boys under-12 category. India, who had ensured three gold medals at the end of the sixth and penultimate round Thursday, went on to seal the top places in the boys under-10 and girls under-14 categories after the final round.  Girls under-14 top seed Mary Ann Gomes finished a  poor 17th with three points. Ravi Teja pipped five of his teammates to win the boys under-10 title. In the final round, he defeated second seed N. Srinath. In the girls under-14 section, J. Rajasurya needed only a draw for the title and she won it with a draw against Raghavi. Boys under-12 top seed Le Quang Liem of Vietnam was the only foreign player to win a gold medal. G. Rohit (under-14 boys), Lakshmi Praneetha (under-12 girls) and P. Lakshmi Sahiti (under-10 girls) had assured gold medals Thursday. (PTI)  Copyright

		 Thursday, January 02, 2003 				 Arsenal, United register wins
																								London: Premiership leaders Arsenal swept into 2003 with a 3-2 win over title rivals Chelsea on Wednesday.																								Manchester United needed a stoppage time winner from Paul Scholes to secure victory over relegation-threatened Sunderland, moving second, five points adrift of the champions.																								Arsenal too lived dangerously allowing their London rivals to come back from 3-0 down. 																								Dennis Bergkamp marked his return to the side with a ninth minute volley that took a deflection off Marcel Desailly to give Arsenal the lead.																								Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Thierry Henry then looked to have made the points safe before Chelsea rallied courtesy Mario Stanic and Emmanuel Petit.																								Manchester United had looked destined for a shock at Old Trafford as the game entered the final ten minutes with Sunderland still holding on to to Juan Sebastian Verons 5th-minute own goal.																								But Man-of-the-Match David Beckham equalised before Scholes headed the winner past Jurgen Macho. (AFP)

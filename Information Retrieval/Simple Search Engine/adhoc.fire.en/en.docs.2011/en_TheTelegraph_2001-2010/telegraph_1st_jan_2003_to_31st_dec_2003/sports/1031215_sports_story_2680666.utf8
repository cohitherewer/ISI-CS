The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England snatch another draw
 - Lanka denied as Vaughan leads survival battle  Michael Vaughan sets off for a run during his match-saving 105 on final day of the second Test in Kandy. (Reuters) Kandy: Captain Michael Vaughan carved a battling century Sunday to steer England to a draw with Sri Lanka in their second Test here. Vaughan defied the rampant Sri Lankan spinners for seven and-a-half hours to score 105, his tenth century in 39 Tests, as England blocked Sri Lankas victory charge to finish on 285 for seven. Set a 368-run victory target, England decided to bat out the final day to earn a draw, as they did in the series-opener at Galle. Man-of-the-Match Vaughan struck 10 boundaries from 333 deliveries. He scored just 16 runs in the afternoon session when he remained stuck in the 90s for an hour as he tried to smother the turn the pitch offered the spinners. Muttiah Muralidharan (four for 64) nearly ruined Englands plans when he dismissed Vaughan, caught bat-pad by Tillekeratne Dilshan at forward short-leg for the seventh wicket, but tailenders Chris Read (18 not out) and Gareth Batty (25 not out) held on to bat for 25 overs and see out the day. Englands tail defied the hosts in the first Test too, where it salvaged a draw with just one wicket remaining. Vaughan shared a 77-run stand with Graham Thorpe (41) that steadied England after losing Nasser Hussain (17) on the fourth ball of the morning. England lost Hussain for the addition of one to the overnight total of 89 for two when he edged pacer Chaminda Vaas (two for 59) to Kumar Sangakkara. Starting the afternoon session on 167 for three, England needed 201 to repeat their 2001 victory at the Asgiriya Stadium. But Vaughan did not risk losing his wicket after departure of Graham Thorpe (41) off the sixth ball after lunch. Thorpe, who top-scored with 57 in the first innings, hit five boundaries from 132 balls in 144 minutes before he was given out caught behind off Muralidharan. Posting Englands top score of the series, Vaughan cut out all strokes during his gritty 92-minute partnership with Paul Collingwood (24), who repeated the determined show of his Test debut in Galle before edging off-spinner Kumar Dharmasena to Mahela Jayawardene at slip.  Sangakkara warned Adding to the frustration of the Lankans was a warning issued by umpire Daryl Harper to Sangakkara, whose sledging remarks seemed to have been picked up the stump microphone. Match Referee Clive Lloyd brought it to Harpers notice.  (AP)  Copyright

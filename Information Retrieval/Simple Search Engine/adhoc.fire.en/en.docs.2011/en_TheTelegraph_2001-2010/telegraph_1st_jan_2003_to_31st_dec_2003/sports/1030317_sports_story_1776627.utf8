The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Highs and lows thus far
  The following are some of the statistical highlights of this World Cup: Sachin Tendulkar, while scoring his 34th ODI hundred (vs Namibia at Pietermaritzburg) became the first batsman to reach three figures against ten different teams. He twice missed out on a 35th ODI hundred (98 vs Pakistan and 97 vs Sri Lanka) but his tally of 586 is already the highest by any player in any edition of the tournament. He has also won eight World Cup MoM awards  another record. Australias Adam Gilchrist became the first player to be dismissed for 99 in a World Cup match (vs Sri Lanka at Centurion). In the same match, Aravinda de Silva became the fifth player to complete 1000 World Cup runs after Tendulkar, Javed Miandad, Viv Richards and Mark Waugh. Chaminda Vaas became the first bowler in international cricket (including Tests) to perform a hattrick with the first three balls of a match  against Bangladesh in Pietermaritzburg. Vaas, with 20 wickets so far, has equalled the record of most wickets in a World Cup. Geoff Allott and Shane Warne had taken 20 each in 1999.This World Cup has already witnessed 19 centuries and 12 five-wicket hauls  the most seen in any other edition of the meet. In 1996, 16 centuries were scored and in 1983, eight five-wicket hauls were recorded.Pakistans match against Zimbabwe was Wasim Akrams 38th World Cup appearance  a record. He became the first bowler to complete 50 World Cup scalps and finished with 55 wickets. Canadas total of 36 (in 18.4 ovs) against Sri Lanka at Paarl was the lowest-ever in World Cups as well as in ODIs. The previous lowest World Cup total of 45 also stood in Canadas name. This was the shortest World Cup match (lasting just 23.2 ovs) that produced a result. The match aggregate of 73 runs was the lowest-ever in ODIs, surpassing the previous low of 78 (Zimbabwe vs Sri Lanka in Colombo, 2001).Canadas John Davison (111) scored the fastest World Cup hundred off just 67 balls against the West Indies at Centurion to surpass Kapil Dev, who had scored 100 off 72 balls against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge Wells in 1983. West Indian Brian Lara scored the fastest World Cup 50 when he reached the mark in 23 balls against Canada at Centurion. He bettered Wavell Hinds 24-ball 50 which was scored in the same match. Australias Darren Lehmann hit 26 runs (4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 6) in an over bowled by Rudi van Vuuren of Namibia. This was the most expensive over in World Cup history. Australia won the match by a world record margin of 256 runs.Compiled  Copyright

 Amandeep Johl comes out of a bunker in the last round in Korea Sunday. (Reuters) Seoul: South Koreas Chung Joon shot five birdies on Sunday to record his first victory on the Asian PGA Tour. Amandeep Johl had to settle for second spot, beaten by one stroke at the $400,000 Maekyung Open golf championship. The 31-year-old Chung shot five birdies and two bogeys on Sunday, finishing the tournament with a 13-under 275 at the Nam Seoul Country Club, just south of Seoul. Its my first victory on the Asian PGA Tour and the first since winning a local circuit tournament in 1996, said Chung, who took home the $81,037 first prize. It has been a long seven years and Ill be aiming for another victory in the next seventh months. Johl, who shot an eagle on the par-5 fourth hole and two birdies on par-4 holes, tied for the lead twice, but at the 18th hole, his approach hit a camera tripod and landed at the front of the green which led to a bogey. Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand, the Asian PGA Order of Merit winner in 2001, shot a five-under 67 finishing in third place. Johl has been among the leading contenders from the first round in this meet. He has been using the rounds well and getting the feel of the greens and the fairways well. This year Johl has made big progress, especially on the Tour where he has coped with tough competition. The bearded 32-year-old also played well in the lest Hong Kong meet when his wife acted caddy. That was when he was finally coming back from golfing wilderness, having last tasted success when he won the 1993 Nepal Open and his best finish since then had been a fifth in last years Maekyung Open. This year, he made amends and improved on his last years performance.  (AP)  Copyright

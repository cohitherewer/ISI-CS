 Dissent over selection in Delhi
New Delhi: After two consecutive defeats, the simmering dissent over the selection of the Delhi Ranji Trophy team came out in the open on Friday with top Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) officials raising doubts about the choice of players for their next against Punjab, starting on Monday. In a letter to DDCA president Arun Jaitley, vice-president C.K. Khanna and joint secretary S.S. Sareen, said the teams poor performance had put a question mark on the selection system. The Delhi team attracted criticism over selection of a couple of players including opener Pururaj Singh, nephew of chief selector Chetan Chauhan. (PTI)  Copyright

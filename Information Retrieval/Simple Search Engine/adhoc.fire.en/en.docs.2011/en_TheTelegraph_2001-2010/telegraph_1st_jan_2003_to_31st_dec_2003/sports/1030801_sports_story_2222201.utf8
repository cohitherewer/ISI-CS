The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, August 01, 2003  7 for Governors Cup on last day 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL Shroff 				 									Bangalore: The Hyderabad Derby winner Astrologica and LAvenir look the best of the seven in the field to fight it out for the Governors Cup on Friday, the concluding day of the season.				 										Both have been well tuned for the event. The one who, however, gets the nod to come out tops on his good run in the Maharajas Cup, is the Ponnappa-ward Astrologica. Although, conceding weight all around, the four-year-old colt by Tejano out of Summer Dust may romp home in the trusted hands of jockey Pesi Shroff.

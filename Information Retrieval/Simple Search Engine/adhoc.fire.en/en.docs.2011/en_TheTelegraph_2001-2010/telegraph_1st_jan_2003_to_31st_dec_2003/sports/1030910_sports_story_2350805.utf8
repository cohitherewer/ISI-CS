The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CAB routed in final
Hyderabad: Defending champions Chemplast scored a resounding 111-run victory over Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) XI to retain the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup at the Gymkhana ground on Tuesday. Chemplast compiled 209 for seven in the allotted 50 overs before bowling out CAB XI for a meagre 98 in 37.2 overs. Left-arm spinner Srikumar Nair and former India medium-pacer Thiru Kumaran did maximum damage, claiming three wickets each. Nair had contributed with the bat too, scoring a quick 22. Badrinath (42), J.P. Yadav (31) and Ajay Kudua (27) also chipped in with handy runs. The CAB batsmen were struggling right from the first over and lost wickets at regular intervals. Barring Amitava Chakraborty (20) and Sanjib Sanyal (16) to an extent, no other batsmen showed the technique or guts to tackle the speed of Kumaran, who claimed three for 28.

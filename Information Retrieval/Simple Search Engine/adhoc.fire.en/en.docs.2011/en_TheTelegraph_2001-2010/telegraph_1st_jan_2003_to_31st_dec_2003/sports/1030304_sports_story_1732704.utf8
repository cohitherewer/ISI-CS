The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No.5 slot gave new dimension 
- For Dravid the moment of victory was of sheer ecstasy FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Pretoria: With all the attention on Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravids role in Indias fantastic World Cup win over Pakistan, last Saturday, got underplayed. Yet, had the vice-captain not produced another sterling innings, at No. 5, the bottomline may not have been so convincing.Ive always maintained the No. 5 position has given a new dimension to my one-day game... I knew what the requirement was and simply worked towards achieving that, Dravid told The Telegraph Monday afternoon.Chatting at the Holiday Inn (on the second off day in succession), Dravid added: In fact, in the last two-three overs, I eased off to take in the atmosphere. At that stage, our victory was assured and I thought, well, let me enjoy the moment... Cheering fans, hundreds of tri-coloured flags... It was incredible and certainly without precedent overseas.Not that Dravid got carried away, but he had a blank mind when he faced Waqar Younis on what became the last delivery. I just went for the (four-fetching) pull... Actually, didnt think of anything, though I knew that hit would take us past Pakistan.Its significant that batting first or second, Dravid has been around till the end or thereabouts in the three key matches after India lost to Australia. Against Zimbabwe, he got an unbeaten 43 and followed that up with 62 versus England. At Centurion, he remained not out on 44.Dravid, of course, didnt forget to compliment Yuvraj Singh (unbeaten on 50). Hes turning into an amazing one-day cricketer and is maturing with every series/tournament. Im sure he will keep up this good work.But was the SuperSport Park finish the most pleasing in seven years of big-league cricket? Dravid thought for just a moment and answered: I wasnt there till the end, but that NatWest final (against England) will remain more special than the others... The finale was spectacular. Meanwhile, while most players opted for a jet-skiing and swimming trip to Vereeniging, organised by a friend of Anil Kumble, the likes of Dravid and Jawagal Srinath opted for a workout in the gym before heading for Johannesburg.The other category  comprising captain Sourav Ganguly, Ashish Nehra, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh  chose to busy themselves with table tennis and pool at the Team Room in the hotel. While Sourav beat Sehwag, he lost to Yuvraj in table tennis. The pool table was monopolised by Sehwag and Nehra.The Indians leave for Cape Town early Tuesday.

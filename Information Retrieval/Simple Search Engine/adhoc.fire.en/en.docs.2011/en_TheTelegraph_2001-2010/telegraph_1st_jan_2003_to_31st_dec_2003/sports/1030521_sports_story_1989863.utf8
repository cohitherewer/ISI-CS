China ready for kill China issued a grim warning Tuesday to all those who are out to spoil their party. China made a clean sweep of seven gold medals at the last two world championships in Osaka and Eindhoven, and were prevented from a similar feat in Manchester in 1997 by Swede Jan-Ove Waldner. However, seven golds will be out of their reach with the team competition being held apart for the first time, in Qatar, next year. Hen Hua, one of the managers masterminding the Chinese assault on the 2003 championships said: Winning everything again is certainly possible, were very well prepared. Weve spent the last two months at a special training camp back home, and all the players are in good shape. Hua, however, felt that the biggest obstacle will come in the mens singles event in the form of Thomas Boll of Germany and Vladamir Samsonov of Belarus. Hua also suggested that the new 11-point rule will make things tough for the Chinese. A player not getting off to a quick start could find himself in trouble. It could also count against a player if he is having an off day.  (PTI)  Copyright

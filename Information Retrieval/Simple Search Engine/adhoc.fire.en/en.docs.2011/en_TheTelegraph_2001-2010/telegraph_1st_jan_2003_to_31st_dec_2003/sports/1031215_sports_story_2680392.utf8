The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Being relaxed made a difference, says Dravid
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Steve Waugh wears  a dejected look during the course of Day III in Adelaide  Adelaide: Despite the temptation to look back,  specifically to March of 2001, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman  remained focussed on the present.  During lunch (Day III, Sunday), our teammates did  ask us to repeat the Eden Gardens show but, really, we were  more concerned with treating every ball on merit, remarked  Laxman, in an interaction with the Media. Echoing much the same thoughts, Dravid observed: Personally, Ive not been thinking of records... Ive helped my game by not putting myself under additional pressure... Ive been wanting to enjoy myself... Being relaxed and not obsessed with doing well has made a difference... Responding to a question, he said: Its important to back yourself, something Ive done... Every hundred is satisfying, but I attach greater value to the ones which help the team win... For example, the ones in Calcutta and Headingley (2002)... Asked by The Telegraph whether Saturdays run out of captain Sourav Ganguly made him more determined to stay rooted, Dravid replied: Look, I was determined in any case... But, yes, that mix-up led to a wicket being lost... Frankly, it did upset me...  The vice-captain doesnt just offer a straight bat,  he talks straight too.  Copyright

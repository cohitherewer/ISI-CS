 Greene fails to make 100m final
 Kelli White of the US after crossing the finish line to win the womens 100m sprint at the world athletics championships in Paris on Sunday. (AP) Paris: Defending mens 100 metres champion Maurice Greene was eliminated from the world championships on Monday when he finished eighth in his semi-final. The American, who had been seeking an unprecedented fourth world title, made a flying start but then faded and pulled up in the closing stages to cross the line in 10.37 seconds. Looking clearly in pain, he limped from the track, favouring his left leg. Commonwealth champion Kim Collins (10.07) won the world 100m title for St Kitts and Nevis. Darrel Brown of Trinidad and Tobago was second and Briton Darren Campbell was third. I got a great start. Then I felt my quad (quadriceps) muscle pop, Greene told reporters. I tried to go through with it but it got worse and worse. Its not a cramp. I wont be able to tell anything until tomorrow. It might be good. It might be bad. You never can tell. Its my thigh muscle. Im just disappointed. Yesterday I was just cramping up from my calves but today it was my quad muscles. Greene, 29, has dominated mens sprinting since he won his first world title in 1997. But he has been increasingly troubled by injury and looked nothing like the dominant figure of old on the European circuit this year. My soul is hurt, he said. But its not the end of an era yet. I will be back next year. I feel pretty bad that I had to give it to them like that, I would rather be in the final and lose it that way rather than not be in the final and go out with an injury. In womens pole vault, Russias Svetlana Feofanova ended Stacy Dragilas supremacy at major events by winning gold. The 23-year-old Feofanova equalled the championship record of 4.75 m at her first attempt to win an eventful final that Dragila left after failing to clear 4.60 m. German Annika Becker took the silver medal with 4.70 m while world record holder Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia won the bronze with 4.65 m. Twice champion Dragila, who has struggled this season after reigning supreme over the relatively young discipline for years, ended up joint fourth with 4.55 m. Ivan Tikhon of Belarus won his first major title with victory in the mens hammer final. The 27-year-old took the lead with his second throw but saved his best for last, producing a huge effort of 83.05 m on his final attempt. European champion Adrian Annus of Hungary snatched the silver medal from Japans Koji Murofushi on his last throw with an effort of 80.36 m. Title favourite Murofushi, second in Edmonton two years ago, had a best distance of 80.12 m. Defending champion Jonathan Edwards withdrew from the mens triple jump final midway through the event. South Africas Jacques Freitag (2.35 m) won the mens high jump. Stefan Holm of Sweden took silver and Canadas Mark Boswell bronze. (Agencies)  Copyright

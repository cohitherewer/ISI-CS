 Anand leads in Monte Carlo
 anand: Beats Ljubojevic Monte Carlo: Viswanathan Anand crushed Ljubomir Ljubojevic of Yugoslavia 2-0 in the fifth round and stormed into sole lead in the 12th Amber blindfold and rapid chess tournament underway here. Anand took his tally to 7 points from 10 games played so far and was in his element in outclassing Ljubojevic in the rapid game after weathering a lean patch in the blindfold. Overnight leader Peter Leko and Russians Vladimir Kramnik and Alexander Morozevich are half a point adrift of Anand while a distant fifth at nearly the halfway stage is Israeli Boris Gelfand on 5.5. Anand also maintained his joint lead with Morozevich in the rapid section and also improved his blindfold standings by moving to joint fourth place alongside Loek Van Wely. (PTI)  Copyright

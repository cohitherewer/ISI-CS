 2007 World Cup berth UAEs target: Abid Ali
Karachi: The United Arab Emirates is trying to get a berth in crickets 2007 World Cup, the teams Indian coach Syed Abid Ali said on Wednesday. I see a lot of potential in U-AE cricket and hope that our targets of winning a berth in the 2007 World Cup in the West Indies and getting the one-day status from the International Cricket Council (ICC) are achieved, Ali said. Ali, 61, who is here as coach of the UAE youth team competing in the Youth Asia Cup, played 29 Tests and four one-day matches for India between 1967 to 1975. Since we are in the ICCs high performance teams, both the ICC and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) are helping us and now its up to the boys to prove themselves, he said. Under Ali, the UAE retained the ACC Trophy last year. Ali disputed the idea that the ICC has taken a strong stance on giving rights to new countries after Bangladeshs dismal showing since being granted Test status in 2000. (AFP)  Copyright

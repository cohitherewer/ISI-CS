 Mehta makes it 4 in-a-row
Taupo: Indias Aditya Mehta brightened his chances of qualifying for the knockout stage after his fourth straight win in the IBSF world under-21 snooker championship Sunday. Saurav Kothari suffered his third setback in five matches. He lost 71-66, 50-67, 58-64, 64-25, 56-14, 12-65, 23-80 to Tyson Crinis of Australia. Aditya overcame Hamed Saeed Dhaif of Bahrain 4-1 (58-30, 79-48, 70-57, 35-54, 64-21) and is almost certain to make it to the round of 32 from his group. On Monday, national champion Pankaj Advani, who had a day off Sunday, will meet Adam Kinghorn of Australia, while Aditya takes on Tian Pengfei of China and Sourav faces Alex Davies of England. Meanwhile, defending champion Ding Junhui of China fell to a shock 3-4 defeat against 19-year old Australian Shannon Dixon in group A. (PTI)  Copyright

However United would face a real battle with the Welsh authorities as Hughes  nicknamed Sparky  has guided Wales to the top of their Euro 2004 qualifying group which included a stunning home win over favourites Italy. Alex (IOC) president Jacques Rogge has criticised heptathlon champion Denise Lewis for working with controversial German coach Ekkart Arbeit.Its not a good idea and I say that very clearly, Rogge told the Sunday Times.I think shes being so unwise, in terms of perception.Arbeit was a senior figure in the highly successful East German athletics programme in the 1980s which, it later emerged, had been built on the systematic doping of athletes.Lewis, Olympic champion in Sydney, has been using Arbeit to help her with throwing and conditioning as she prepares to make her comeback to competition next weekend at a European Cup combined events meeting in Tallinn.Lewis had a baby last year and needs to do well in Tallinn to qualify for the world championships to be close to signing a deal with United Arab Emirates club Al Ain, according to a newspaper report here Sunday.The 31-year-old Rivaldo, who moved to AC Milan last summer from Barcelona, has spent much of the season on the bench and is said to have been attracted by the Emirates clubs offer, according to Khaleej Times.Al Ain, who have reached the semi-finals of the Asian Champions League, are set to be coached by Frenchman Bruno Metsu, who Lucio will stay with the Bundesliga side and not transfer to Italian club AS Roma, the German team said on Sunday.This will put an end to all the speculation that he will be leaving, Leverkusen said in a statement, hours after the World Cup winner had said the same thing in a German newspaper.I have decided to play for another year with Bayer Leverkusen.

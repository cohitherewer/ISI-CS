The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZC chief to join Pak tour 
Auckland: New Zealand Cricket chief executive Martin Snedden is to accompany the team on their troubled tour of Pakistan, according to reports on Thursday. I like the idea of going with the team at the moment because with so much going on it is preferable to see it for yourself, Snedden told Wellingtons Dominion-Post newspaper. The tour was due to start on Thursday but was put back a week after threats were made to New Zealand players. Scott Styris, Lou Vincent, Ian Butler and Craig McMillan made themselves unavailable following the threats. Captain Stephen Fleming has also pulled out with abdominal injury. The tour party is due to be announced on Friday. You sit here in New Zealand and make judgement but nothing beats experiencing what they are getting, Snedden added. New Zealand are also considering sending John Bracewell to Pakistan as the teams coach. Bracewell was not due to take over his coaching duties until next month. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangladesh look to end losing streak
 Durban: Bangladesh look set to finally end their embarrassing streak of 26 straight defeats when they begin their campaign at Kingsmead on Tuesday. The confidence stems from the fact that their opponents in the day-night encounter are Canada, who came through the qualifying ranks to take part in only their second World Cup. Bangladesh have struggled to compete with the big boys, having succeeded in just three of their 61 one-day matches since being granted ODI status in 1985-86. Bangladeshs confidence has been lifted by a 4-1 win over fellow-World Cuppers Namibia in a warm-up series last month, which featured an astonishing innings of 177 off 145 balls by opener Al Sahariar in the last game. A bigger morale-booster was the five-wicket win over Kwa Zulu Natal last week . TEAMS Bangladesh (from): Khaled Mashud (capt.), Al Sahariar, Alok Kapali, Habibul Bashar, Hannan Sarker, Ehsanul Hoque, Sanwar Hossain, Khaled Mahmud, Manjurul Islam, Mashrafe Mortaza, Mohammed Ashraful, Mohammed Rafique, Talha Jubair, Tapash Baisya, Tushar Imran.

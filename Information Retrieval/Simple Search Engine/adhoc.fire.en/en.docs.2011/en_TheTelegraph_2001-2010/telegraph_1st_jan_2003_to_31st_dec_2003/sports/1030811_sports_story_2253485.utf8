 ACC to make official request 
Karachi: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Sunday suggested the inclusion of cricket in the South Asian Federation (SAF) Games as part of a move to re-establish bilateral ties between the two neighbours. ACC will officially request the South Asian Sports Federation (SASF) to include cricket in the SAF Games which we think can be stepping stone for the revival of cricket between India and Pakistan, ACC development manager Zakir Hussain Syed said. We are sure that cricket can increase the appeal of the Games to a great extent, and besides Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh  the four Test playing nations  Nepal can also chip in, he said. Pakistan last week announced it will stage the SAF Games in January 2004 after forfeiting its right to host the Games April this year after becoming frustrated by repeated postponements.

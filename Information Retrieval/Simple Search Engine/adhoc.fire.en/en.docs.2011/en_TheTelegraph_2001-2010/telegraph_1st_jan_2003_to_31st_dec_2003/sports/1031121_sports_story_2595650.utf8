 Racist Wessels suspended
George: Former South Africa captain Kepler Wessels has been suspended as coach of Eastern Province following allegations of racism, according to newspaper reports on Thursday. The move follows an instruction from the UCBSA on Wednesday that Wessels, who denies the claim, be suspended on full pay pending the outcome of a disciplinary hearing. The Port Elizabeth Herald reported on Wednesday that Wessels was alleged to have made a racist remark during net practice last month. I can confirm that two players have lodged complaints of racism with EP cricket, Eastern Province chief executive Dave Emslie told the paper. Wessels, who played 40 Tests for Australia and South Africa, has welcomed the inquiry, saying: I demand the investigation take place as soon as possible. I welcome it. The matter is in the hands of my legal advisors and we will fight it all the way. I am looking forward to the outcome.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

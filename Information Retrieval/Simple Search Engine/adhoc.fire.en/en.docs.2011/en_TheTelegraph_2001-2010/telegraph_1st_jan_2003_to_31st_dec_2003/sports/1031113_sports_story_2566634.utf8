The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Humpy run continues
Kozhikode: Top seed Koneru Humpy maintained her winning streak to remain in the sole lead with six points after the sixth round of the 30th National Womens A chess championship here on Wednesday. Pitted against lowly-placed C.V. Rajalakshmi of Tamil Nadu, the reigning Asian womens champion won in 39 moves. I want to continue in the same fashion but I will have to encounter some formidable opponents later on, Humpy said. Trailing the leader with five points each were second seed S. Vijayalakshmi (TN) and WGM Nisha Mohota (LIC). In the only notable upset of the day, fifth seed Swati Ghate (LIC) was overpowered by Eesha Karvade of Maharashtra, while in a marathon game stretching to 101 moves, IWM Y. Prathiba finally settled for a draw with Saheli Nath of Bengal. In a Larson Attack, Vijayalakshmi got the better of Sai Meera in 58 moves, while Mohota easily overcame the Grunfeld Defence of Anupama Gokhale to emerge winner in 48 moves. In the third spot were Aarthie Ramaswamy (TN) and Dronavalli Harika (AP) with 4.5 points apiece. (PTI)  Copyright

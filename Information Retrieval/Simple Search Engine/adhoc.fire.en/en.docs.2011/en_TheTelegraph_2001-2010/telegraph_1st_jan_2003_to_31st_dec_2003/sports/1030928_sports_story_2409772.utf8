The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its Kiri, not Kirti
 - World Cup-winning keeper to become chief selector  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Syed Kirmani Calcutta, Sept.27: Till yesterday, Syed Kirmani wasnt even a member of the Boards senior selection committee. Yet, by late tonight, he was chosen to succeed the indisposed Brijesh Patel as chief selector. Its been a remarkable 24 hours for Indias finest wicketkeeper, who is currently in New Delhi on an invitation from Bishan Singh Bedi. A formal announcement, though, may not be coming till tomorrow afternoon, when the two-day AGM ends. According to The Telegraphs sources, Kirmanis appointment became a formality once South decided to nominate him and not Tamil Nadus V.B. Chandrasekhar. Of course, its the Board presidents prerogative to name the committee chairman. Till last night, Norths Kirti Azad  like Kirmani, a member of the 1983 World Cup-winning XI  was tipped to take over from Brijesh. However, the powers-that-be began having second thoughts as some questioned Kirtis temperament to head the committee. Apparently, there was talk that Kirti could fly off the handle and might attempt to bulldoze his way. Really, Souths decision gave the biggest boost to those who werent in favour of Kirti, incidentally a BJP Member of Parliament. Moreover, with appearances in 88 Tests and 49 ODIs, Kirmani is infinitely more experienced than Kirti (7 Tests and 25 ODIs). Actually, that counted for a lot more than Kirti already having spent a year on the committee. After all, if the number of years (on the committee) was to be the criteria for chief selector, Centrals Sanjay Jagdale stood most experienced: He has completed three on-the-trot. But, then, Jagdale never played for India and, usually, an International gets the nod. Notable exceptions, in recent years, have been Raj Singh Dungarpur and Kishan Rungta. That Souths representatives (including Hyderabads Shivlal Yadav) made a strong presentation before Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya, during the day, helped Kirmanis cause. They emphasised their nominee was the best candidate and that his claims ought not to be ignored. Besides having been an outstanding wicketkeeper, Kirmani has always come across as thoughtful and balanced. Clearly, a selection committee chairman must have those qualities, is how one of the sources put it. By the way, two of the five selectors (for 2003-2004) are now wicketkeepers  the other being Wests Kiran More, who retained his place despite being under some pressure. Easts Pranab Roy completes the quintet. Like More, he moves into year No.2. Meanwhile, one learns that the Boards general body didnt seem too impressed (on Day-I of the AGM) by the formation of an ad-hoc committee which chose the squad for the Emerging Nations Trophy. In a first, that committee was chaired by Sunil Gavaskar.  Copyright

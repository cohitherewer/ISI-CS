The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav the right skipper, says Dravid
Mumbai: Rahul Dravid said on Wednesday that Sourav Ganguly, recovering from surgery in Calcutta, is the right person to lead the Indian team. My tenure as Indian captain is just temporary and once Sourav is fully fit, I will hand over the reins to him as he is the right person to lead the side, said the stand-in captain. The player also announced the launch of Nirmal Lifestyles Rahul Dravid Cricket Scholarship  a programme to help young players. Dravid said he will select five under-14 and under-16 players in two to three months and try to nurture them. Most young talents in the country do not have financial backup and our idea is to provide not only financial support but also to guide them to become fine sportsmen and good human beings. We will act as their friend, guide and philosopher, Dravid said.  (PTI)  Copyright

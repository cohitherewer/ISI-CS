 Elite C in drivers seat
 AGARKAR: Four wickets Hyderabad, April 5 (PTI): Elite C were hurtling towards victory after Ajit Agarkar and S. K. Trivedi claimed four wickets each to bundle out Plate A for just 182 in the second innings on the penultimate day of the Duleep Trophy match here today. At close, Elite C, who enjoyed a 15-run first innings lead, were 24 without loss, needing only 144 more runs to secure a win. Earlier Elite C, who resumed at their overnight 251 for 7, ended their first innings at 278 in reply to Plate A score of 263. Overnight batsman N. Doru hit a brilliant 74 with the help of eight hits to the fence and was mainly responsible for Elite C attaining the slender first innings lead. Trivedi and Agarkar wrecked the Plate A top order reducing them to 14 for four at one stage. Rajesh Kumar and T.V.S. Naidu defied the bowling by adding 110 runs for sixth wicket and stabilised the innings to a certain extent before Agarkar struck again to dismiss Rajesh for 55. Naidu survived a little longer to script a more fluent and enterprising 75 in 130 balls with eight fours and two mighty sixes. Elite B struggle In Bangalore, rain and bad light disrupted the penultimate days play between Elite A and Elite B. With only 136 minutes of play possible on the day, Elite B were 64 for four in their second innings. They need 79 more runs to avoid an innings defeat and face a daunting task on a wet pitch with intermittent drizzle continuing till this evening. Elite B started their second innings shakily, losing opener Wasim Jaffer (5) caught by Venugopal Rao off Irafan Pathan (jr) with only five on the board. Off spinner Sarandeep Singh dismissed other opener Amit Pagnis for a duck and later sent back A. T. Rayadu (0) with Elite B reeling at 3/23. They then lost Vinayak Mane. Arun Yadav (19) and M. S. K. Prasad (15) were batting when play was called off due to bad light and a steady drizzle. SUMMARISED SCORES n In Bangalore: Elite B 219 amp; 64/4 (Sarandeep Singh 2/14). Elite A 362/8 decl.

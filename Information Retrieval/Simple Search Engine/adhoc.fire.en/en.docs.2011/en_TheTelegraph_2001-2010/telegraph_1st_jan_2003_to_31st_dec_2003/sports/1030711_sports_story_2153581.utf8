 Injured Venus, Seles withdraw
 Billie Jean King thinks both need time to recuperate White Plains: Venus Williams and Monica Seles have withdrawn from the US Fed Cup team due to injuries. Williams aggravated an abdominal strain at Wimbledon and Seles is bothered by a foot injury. Fans around the world watched Venus valiantly compete while injured at Wimbledon and we understand her need to recuperate, said captain Billie Jean King on Wednesday. Monica has been a stalwart contributor to the US Fed Cup effort, but she too has been playing hurt and her need to fully heal from a foot injury supersedes this Fed Cup commitment. King named Chanda Rubin, the world No. 8, and Alexandra Stevenson as the replacements. They join Meghann Shaughnessy and Lisa Raymond on the US team that will face Italy in the quarter final from July 19-20 in Washington. Chanda has overcome a number of operations and obstacles and has had an unbelievable run to get back into the Top 10, King said. Its great to have her back on the Fed Cup effort along with Alexandra, Meghann and Lisa, who have played on the team this year and last. The Italian team captain Corrado Barrazzutti named Silvia Farina-Elia, Francesca Schiavone, Rita Grande and Tathiana Garbin in his team. Farina Elia, 31, had her best Grand Slam finish at Wimbledon, reaching the quarter finals and defeating Rubin. (AFP)  Copyright

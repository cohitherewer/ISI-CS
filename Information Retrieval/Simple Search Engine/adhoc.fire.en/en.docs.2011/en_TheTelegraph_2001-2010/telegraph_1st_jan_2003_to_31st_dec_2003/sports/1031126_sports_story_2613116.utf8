The Indian teams in the fray are defending champions Air India, runners-up Indian Airlines, Indian Navy, ONGC, Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum.				 																																	 London: The search is on for a poet of the soccer terraces to lift the tone as well as the voices of the crowd as they follow the beautiful game.Led by Poet Laureate Andrew Motion, the goal of the search is to capture the best moments of the top English soccer matches next season and immortalise them in verse.The appointment of a Chant Laureate demonstrates that chants are an art form and should be recognised as such, Motion said on Tuesday. Each weekend English soccer terraces echo to the chants of rival supporters praising the talents of their heroes and denigrating the opposition. Sometimes the chants are just crude, but increasingly they are using humour to make the point.				 																																	Wimbledon: English tennis officials has announced profits of $43.9 million from last summers Wimbledon championships.				 																																	The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) said profits were down from 2002 but did not say by how much. The LTA said revenues have decreased as a result of the economic downturn since the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. Profits in 2001 were $54.4 million.				 																																	Profits from Wimbledon go to the LTA for the sports development in Britain.				 																																	London: John McEnroe began coaching British tennis youngsters urging them to put some fire into their play.				 																																	McEnroe was at Queens Club in West London on Monday taking a training session with Britains leading performance junior squad. It was the first session of an informal and open-ended coaching arrangement with the Lawn Tennis Association.				 																																	The three-time Wimbledon champion will work alongside performance director David Felgate  Tim Henmans former coach  when his timetable permits.				 																																	I want to get back on court and put some fire into those players bellies, McEnroe said.				 																																	London: Leeds United and England striker Alan Smith has been charged with improper conduct by the Football Association (FA) for throwing a bottle into the crowd, the FA said on Tuesday.

His arrest on November 13 prompted the FA to drop him from the national side hours after he was called up as a late replacement for a friendly to be played at Old Trafford against Denmark three days later.				 																																	Smith has until December 9 to respond to the FA.

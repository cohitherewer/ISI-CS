		 Monday, December 01, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	London: Unsettled Brazilian striker Rivaldo, who is set to leave European champions AC Milan during the winter transfer window, fancies a move to Chelsea, which he has compared to an all-star NBA team. The 31-year-old forward has failed to become a regular starter for Carlo Ancelotti since joining AC from Barcelona at the start of last season and most recently has been angling for a move to the English Premiership. 				 																																	Now Rivaldo has set his sights on Chelsea, who ever since the arrival of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich he holds in high esteem. Now I would be very happy to play for Chelsea, Rivaldo told the News of the World. 				 																																	It is as though Roman Abramovich is running an NBA all-star team. He has turned Chelsea into a side with a unique style, unlike any other team in England.				 																																	La Quinta (California): Annika Sorenstam made history and a spectacular final shot to come away the big winner against her male competitors in the first day of the $1 million skins game. Sorenstam sank a 39-yard shot from a sand trap for an eagle to win $175,000 on the par-5, 524-yard ninth hole.				 																																	Phil Mickelson earned $100,000 with a pair of $50,000 skins at the New Trilogy Golf Club. Fred Couples sank a 15-foot birdie putt on the first hole for a $25,000 skin.				 																																	Defending champion Mark OMeara had no skins and no earnings halfway through the made-for-TV event.				 																																	London: Former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe is to help the English Football Association review their drug testing procedures, FA chief executive Mark Palios said on Saturday. As part of the FAs review of our drug testing programme, I am delighted that Lord Coe has agreed to become involved in an advisory capacity, Palios said. He has great experience in sport and government and is respected by everyone.				 																																	The whole issue of drugs in soccer has become more relevant with an increase in the number of cases in the sport in the last 12 months, and English soccer in particular has been rocked by the Rio Ferdinand case.				 																																	London: Debt-ridden Premier League club Leeds United could be taken over within a week by wealthy Middle Eastern investors, according to reports in Britains newspapers.				 																																	Sheikh Abdul Rahman bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, a member of Bahrains royal family and a Leeds fan for 25 years, declined to give any figures but a bid in the region of  20 million has been suggested, according to The Sunday Telegraph. 				 																																	Its a group of investors from the Gulf, not just Bahrain, that I am leading and that will take over the English club, the Sheikh was quoted as saying.				 																																	I prefer not to give a figure because the club is heavily indebted and is looking to be rescued and thats what I am trying to do, he added, saying he expected a deal to be closed within a week.				 																																	Tokyo: Yokohama F-Marinos did more than break the monopoly of Jubilo Iwata and Kashima Antlers by winning the closest title race in J-League history  they breathed new life into domestic soccer in Japan. There was something fitting about striker Tatsuhiko  Kubo, a player described by a former manager as being completely  bonkers, snatching an injury-time winner to give Yokohama  a 2-1 victory over 2002 champions Jubilo Iwata on Saturday.

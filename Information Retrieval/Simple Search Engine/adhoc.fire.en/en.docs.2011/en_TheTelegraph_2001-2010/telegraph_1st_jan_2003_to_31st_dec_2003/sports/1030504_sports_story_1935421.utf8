The Telegraph - Calcutta
 ICC warning
Bridgetown, May 3 (Reuters): Countries boycotting World Cup matches may be kicked out of the tournament in future, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said on Saturday. The ICC will also decide this year whether to change the format of the competition and reduce the number of teams taking part. Speed said after a meeting with west Indies Cricket Board offcials the World Cups credibility was damaged by Englands refusal to play a match in Harare and New Zealand. He also said that in future, he wanted the ICC to make teams sign an undertaking to fulfil all their World Cup fixtures.  Speed, however, rejected suggestions that this years  tournament had been too long. He also added that security  was satisfactory in South Africa.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Samba magic in Real victory
 - EUROPEAN ROUND-UP - Deportivo down Barcelona to go atop; Inter manage 2-2 draw  Celta Vigos Juanfran tackles David Beckham of Real Madrid during their Serie A match in Vigo on Saturday. (AP) Madrid: Goals in each half from Brazilians Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos earned champions Real Madrid a 2-0 away win over Celta Vigo at a rain-soaked Balaidos in the Primera Liga on Saturday. World Player of the Year Ronaldo opened the scoring after 24 minutes when he finished off a slick counter-attack with his customary efficiency, drilling past Celta keeper Pablo Cavallero with his right foot. Celta, who have made a spluttering start to the campaign, were a mere shadow of the side that finished fourth last season and despite enjoying their fair share of possession they hardly managed to manufacture a clear scoring chance in the first half. Real eased up after the break, but Celta failed to take advantage and Roberto Carlos made sure of victory for a third year in a row in Vigo when he belted in from just six metres out after cutting inside right back Juan Velasco. Celta remain mired in the lower reaches of the table with just one victory from six matches. The game at Balaidos started in cagey fashion as both teams sized each other up in midfield in the opening 10 minutes, but with Zinedine Zidane at the helm it did not take long for Real to get into their stride. The Frenchman combined well with Ronaldo before firing a shot across the face of the goal following a David Beckham free-kick on 11 minutes and Raul was denied an opener when Cavallero blocked an effort soon after. Zidane began the goalbound move a few metres inside the Celta half when he sprayed the ball wide to Figo who cut a first time pass to Ronaldos feet and the Brazilian took just one more step before cracking a precise right-foot shot past Cavallero to score his sixth of the season. Celta appeared to be working their way back into the game Real hit them again on 65 minutes. Zidane swung the ball out to Roberto Carlos on the left and the Brazilian defender controlled with his chest, checked past Velasco before smashing in from close range. Meanwhile, goals from Albert Luque and Sergio gave Deportivo Coruna a 2-0 win at Barcelona that sent them atop. Deportivos two Barcelona-born players scored in each half to secure victory at the Nou Camp for the second season in a row.  Juventus win Two goals from Fabrizio Miccoli helped champions Juventus to a 3-2 win at Ancona while Inter Milan needed an 87th-minute penalty from Christian Vieri to come back for a 2-2 draw at Brescia. Leaders Juventus move three points clear of AC Milan. Inter, now without a win in four games in Serie A, are in sixth place. Miccoli, given the nod ahead of David Trezeguet in attack, put Juve on their way in the 29th minute with a shot that Vincenzo Sommese tried in vain to stop with his hand on the line. Gianluca Zambrotta made it 2-0 a minute before the break with a fine shot from the edge of the area after a smartly-worked corner. The game looked over five minutes into the second half when Miccoli stooped to head home a Zambrotta cross for Juves third but then Marcello Lippis side took their foot off the gas and let Serie As bottom club back into the game. Maurizio Ganzs corner was headed home by William Viali in the 57th minute and then former Milan and Inter forward Ganz struck the post. It was injury time when Ganz pulled another back with a cool finish and that left little time to really scare Juventus who now have five wins from the opening six matches of the season. Inter, on the other hand, had to fight back from two goals down at Brescia. Roberto Baggio opened the scoring for Brescia, against his old club, in the 21st minute by tapping into an empty net after Inter keeper Francesco Toldo had made a hash of a header back from Jeremie Brechet. Baggio then set up Brescias second, four minutes after the interval, with a fine cross which was headed home by Andrea Caracciolo. Just two minutes after going on, Cruz began Inters comeback with a diving header from a Recoba free-kick.  Then the Argentine striker was  ruled to have been fouled by Brescia defender Dario Dainelli  three minutes from the end, allowing Vieri to blast home  the spot kick. (Reuters)  Copyright

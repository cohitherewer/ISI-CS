 Hearing in Vizag from Saturday 
New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s inquiry commissioner D.V. Subba Rao will begin his probe on Saturday that will be restricted to player Abhijit Kale and the two national selectors  Kiran More and Pranab Roy, who have made the complaint. I have only received faxed copies of the relevant papers from the BCCI. The originals have not yet reached me. I will start the probe process on Saturday, Rao, who is also the chairman of the Bar Council of India, informed over telephone from Visakhapatnam on Monday. Asked whether the scope of the inquiry would be broadened in view of the fresh allegations against some former selectors, Rao pointed out, it will be limited to these three persons. The terms of reference have been restricted, so I will not be looking into other issues.  He said it was for the BCCI to decided whether to expand the scope of inquiry considering the new developments involving former first-class cricketers from Hyderabad  Vanka Pratap and Pavan Kumar  who have alleged of corruption at high places during selection process. Rao said both Kale and the two selectors would be called to Visakhapatnam for the hearings and notices would be sent to them in the next couple of days. Rao, who is based in Visakhapatnam, also informed that in the next couple of days he would finalise all the modalities and logistics required to carry on the investigations. The BCCI has suspended Kale for allegedly offering Rs 10 lakh each to two national selectors for a Team India berth and appointed Rao as the commissioner of inquiry. The commissioner has been asked to submit his findings within 15 days. The inquiry report will be referred to the BCCIs disciplinary committee for final adjudication and till that time Kale will remain suspended from participating in any tournament conducted by the BCCI.  Pratap showcaused Meanwhile, the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) decided to showcause Pratap for his allegation. HCA emergency executive meeting has decided to issue a showcause notice on Pratap to give an explanation within three days on the charges he made against selectors, HCA president M. Ranga Reddy said after the meeting on Monday. The cricketer should explain what exactly he means by the allegations levelled on HCA... the reply would be referred to the disciplinary committee.

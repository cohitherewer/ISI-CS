 Sukur keeps Galatasaray hopes alive

(AFP) Dortmund: Hakan Sukur scored twice as Galatasaray beat Juventus 2-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday, keeping alive the Turkish teams hopes of qualifying from group D. Hakan grabbed the opener two minutes after the restart with a fine header and then sealed the victory with an injury time strike after being put through by Hasan Sas. The result moves Galatasaray above Olympiakos into third place on six points, but leaves them two points behind their next opponents  second-placed Real Sociedad. Fatih Terims side must win that match in Spain next week if they are to go through to the knock-out stage of the competition. The match against the Italian champions had been postponed by a week and switched to Dortmunds Westfalen stadium by Uefa following the recent attacks in Istanbul. But there was no doubt that Galatasaray enjoyed home advantage. The ground was packed with Turkish supporters, so many that the start was delayed for 15 minutes due to traffic congestion. We did so well in the second half in terms of chances, possession and determination, said Terim. I have to give my compliments to all the players. With little at stake for Juve, coach Marcello Lippi rested big names such as Pavel Nedved, David Trezeguet and Alessandro Del Piero but, from the outset, it was clear that the Italians were keen to beat Terims side. Galatasaray keeper Faryd Mondragon was busy from the start and was out quick to foil Marco Di Vaio in the 11th minute. Shortly afterwards, though, the Turks tested Juve keeper Antonio Chimenti, playing instead of the rested Gianluigi Buffon, with a well-struck effort from Berkant Goktan. Fabrizio Miccoli, another Juve player given a rare start, struck the post with a 20-metre free-kick in the 29th minute but it was end-to-end football and moments later Berkant tested Chimenti again. Juve ended the half with a spell of intense pressure. After Di Vaio had twice gone close, Mondragon did well to keep out a shot from Enzo Maresca and just before the break the Colombian keeper pulled off an excellent double save to keep out a Miccoli strike and then Di Vaios follow-in. But two minutes into the second half the Turks grabbed the lead when the lively Sabri Sarioglu burst down the left wing and his cross was met at the near post by Hakan with a smartly angled glancing header past Chimenti. The Italian champions responded positively with Maresca twice forcing Mondragon into saves, but the game drifted into scrappy battles in midfield as the Turks sought to keep a firm grip on the lead. Ten minutes from the end, Berkant missed a great chance to secure victory with a second goal, shooting wide after being put through on goal by Hakan. However Hakan, who failed to impress in spells in Italy with Torino, Inter Milan and Parma, made sure there was no chance of a comeback from Juve, slotting home confidently in injury time after Hasan put him through with a smart pass.

 Stephen aflame 
 - First Test - NZ skipper defies Pakistan fightback in post-tea session  Stephen Fleming evades one en route to his unbeaten 125 versus Pakistan in Hamilton on Friday. (AFP) Hamilton: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming cracked his sixth Test century on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan on Friday. Fleming, who only confirmed his fitness on Thursday, was batting on 125 at the close after he watched Pakistan fight back with four wickets following the tea interval to leave the home team on 295 for six. Robbie Hart was unbeaten on seven. I worked hard in the nets three or four days out and what you saw today was someone who thought a lot about this innings and what I had to do, said Fleming, who overcame an abdominal strain to play in the Test. New Zealand went to tea on 192 for two but lost Scott Styris (33), Craig McMillan (22), Chris Cairns (11) and Jacob Oram (six) in the final session. Styris was removed by a catch by Taufeeq Umar off Danish Kaneria before McMillan fell to the same combination immediately after he had hit the spinner over long on for two successive sixes. Cairns, playing his first Test for almost two years, edged a ball from Shabbir Ahmed to wicketkeeper Moin Khan before Shabbir picked up his third wicket of the day when Oram was bowled round his legs. Through it all Fleming was majestic. He shared two century partnerships, with Mark Richardson (44) for the second wicket and Styris for the third to give New Zealand a solid start. Fleming said he had been edgy leading up to the Test. Weve had some good results away but theres nothing better than performing in front of your home crowd. Pakistan coach Javed Miandad appeared satisfied with his teams overall progress. At one stage they were doing well, so I think we did well to restrict them at the end, said Miandad, whose side won their last Test series when South Africa toured Pakistan in October. Shabbir was the most successful Pakistan bowler by finishing the day with three for 51.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

We have already held talks with several television channels in this regard, he said. Staging the play-off final after the October 24-November 1 Afro-Asian Games will allow all the top players to take part. Defending champions East Bengal, at one time looked runaway favourites to retain the crown, but have faltered in the later stages. This allowed Mohun Bagan to seize the opportunity and force the play-off. To win the league straight, a team needs to have a three-point difference from the closest rivals. East Bengal finished the league on 41 points, while Mohun Bagan garnered 39 after 16 matches  before heading for the play-off engagement.  Copyright

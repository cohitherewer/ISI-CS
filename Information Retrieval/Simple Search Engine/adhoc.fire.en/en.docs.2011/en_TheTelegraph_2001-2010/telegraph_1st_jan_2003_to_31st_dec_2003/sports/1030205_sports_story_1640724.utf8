The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fourth loss for Indian eves
 New Delhi: Indian women Tuesday suffered their fourth loss in five matches, a humiliating nine-wicket defeat to Australia in the mini World Cup cricket in Lincoln, New Zealand. Already out of contention for a berth in the final, they concentrated on batting through their full quota of 50 overs rather than go for a win and put up 134 for seven which Australia overhauled in 28 overs, according to information received here. Openers Anjum Chopra and D. Rumeli put on 48 runs for the first wicket. India have six points from five matches (five points for a win and one bonus point) and take on England in their last league tie Thursday. Australia and New Zealand face each other in their last league match Wednesday.  (PTI)  Copyright

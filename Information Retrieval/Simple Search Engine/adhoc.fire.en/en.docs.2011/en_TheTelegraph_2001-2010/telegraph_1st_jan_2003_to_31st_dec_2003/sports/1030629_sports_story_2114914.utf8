The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Limitations, but no limits: Buchanan
- THE 15 COMMANDMENTS BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Calcutta, June 28: A quiet word can often make the difference. Yet, if one goes by a John Buchanan example, a hug too may dramatically recast the canvas.Justin Langer will confirm that.Actually, Justin was having a poor Ashes tour (2001) and we had almost come to its end... Its not that he wasnt trying, but the harder he tried, the more he didnt succeed His one last chance was the final County game before the last Test (The Oval). As it turned out, Justin failed yet again.Its then that I decided to have a word and, on returning to the hotel, both of us and the vice-captain (Adam Gilchrist) headed for the bar. We were there till around midnight, with Justin doing the talking He came out with everything: The disappointment, pain He was hurt that we hadnt backed him at the start of the series  As we left for our rooms, I hugged Justin Fortunately, nobody saw us or, else, there could have been a big story! Clearly, he felt better and so did I. Again, spontaneously, I asked whether he still had it in him to deliver. Just give me the chance, was Justins response, this time with a smile.The rest, as they say, is history. He scored an unbeaten 102 before retiring hurt and hasnt looked back since Frankly, I ought to have spoken to Justin much earlier, I should have communicated better It was, for me, a lesson, acknowledged numero uno coach Buchanan, during his fascinating (HSBC-arranged) talk on Managing Champion Teams here last night.[Incidentally, in the 22 Tests after that, opener Langer has averaged just a shade below 60, recording eight hundreds and six fifties. This superb run has taken his career average to a handsome 45-plus.]  Man-management, however, is only part of the business of managing a team  champion or otherwise. The brief includes creating an aura for which the internal player-analysis (personality types) comes in handy.Buchanan revealed that Team Australia was determined to create a real presence on landing in South Africa for this years World Cup. Reinforcing that real presence was step No. 2.Still, according to Buchanan, retaining crickets most coveted trophy isnt anything more than setting up base camp No. 1 on way to Everest.Later, interacting with The Telegraph, Buchanan grinned and confessed he didnt quite know crickets equivalent of conquering Everest. Cant say, dont know, he insisted.Amazing, coming from somebody who has watched his wards smash both Test and one-day records with such contempt.But, then, Buchanan believes in never getting satisfied In constantly raising the bar Believes in there being no limit to achievementIts a one-ball game and, so, the right decisions must constantly be made The coach merely helps in reaching those decisions It should, of course, come to a stage where he becomes redundant He must challenge the players to think and, essentially, each one of them should become his own best coach, Buchanan opined.An unusual line of thought, yes, but its difficult imagining Buchanan to be predictable. Indeed, he must already have begun plotting to unleash something different in  Copyright

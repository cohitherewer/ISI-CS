		 Tuesday, February 18, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Sydney: A senior Australian Cricket Board (ACB) official will visit Zimbabwe to have a first hand inspection of the security conditions ahead of Australias match against Zimbabwe Monday.				 																																	ACB cricket operations manager Michael Brown will travel to review the security set-up in Bulawayo  the venue for their Sunday game.				 																																	Its just part of the ongoing process, Brown said.				 																																	Im just going to be meeting the people who are in charge over there and see what happens in and around the ground. Im sure the players will have plenty of questions when I get back, he said.				 																																	The men from Down Under have already reduced their stay in Zimbabwe from five days to two.				 																																	The team will now be in Bulawayo a day prior to the match and plans to leave immediately after the match, it said.				 																																	Kimberley: Pakistan paceman Shoaib Akhtar recorded the fastest delivery in World Cup history Sunday against Namibia.				 																																	Shoaib was timed at 98.5 miles an hour (158.58 km/hr) when he bowled to Namibian tail-ender Rudie van Vuuren.				 																																	I am delighted to have bowled the fastest ball in the World Cup but I am here to take wickets and put my team on the right track to win the title, he said.				 																																	For me, the delivery I bowled in Lahore was the fastest. Its okay to hit the speedometer as long as I keep taking wickets. The four wickets I took were very satisfying even if it was only against Namibia.				 																																	Sydney: ICC president Malcom Gray is disappointed by England skipper Naseer Hussains charge that the games apex body had fudged the Zimbabwe issue.				 																																	Hussain, who has threatened to quit as England captain in wake of the fracas over Englands refusal to play their World Cup match in Zimbabwe, said the ICC top bosses had fudged the issue. Disappointed, end of story, was all that Gray said. 				 																																	Pietermaritzburg: Sri Lankan fast bowler Chaminda Vaas planted a liquid-amber tree here to commemorate his record-breaking bowling performance against Bangladesh.				 																																	Vaas became the first bowler to take wickets with the first three deliveries of the match  hat-trick  and finished it with another wicket two balls later  four in all.				 																																	It has become customary for bowlers to plant a tree for a five-wicket effort after the first known tree was planted by English batting legend Denis Compton in 1957.				 																																	Other international players to have planted trees are West Indians Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Malcolm Marshall, and South Africas Jacques Kallis.				 																																	Paarl: Sri Lanka will decide in a couple of days time whether to call for a standby as cover up for injured fast bowler Pulasthi Gunaratne.				 																																	Gunaratne broke his right index finger while fielding during the sides victory in the opening match against New Zealand in Bloemfontein.				 																																	The team management is hopeful Gunaratne will recover in time for Lankas important match against the West Indies at Newlands on February 28.				 																																	East London: England captain Nasser Hussain has chided the British media for harping on the teams lack of match practice being a cause for concern.				 																																	You boys panic about match practice, Hussain told a British journalists Sunday after Englands win against The Netherlands.				 																																	Before that match, England had played only one warm-up game against a local South African side since a tri-nation series in Australia in December.				 																																	It is about rest, it is about getting things right on the day. Just because you play every day of the week doesnt mean on a given day you will be better, Hussain said.				 																																	East London: England will come up against an old friend when they take on Namibia in their second World Cup match in Port Elizabeth Wednesday but are not in a position to show any mercy in their pursuit of glory at crickets biggest stage. The tournament debutants, outclassed in their first two games in group A, are coached by Scotland-born Dougie Brown, who played nine one-day Internationals for England in 1997 and 1998.				 																																	Brown, Namibias coach since last October as part of an arrangement with the ICC, famously removed West Indies batsmen Philo Wallace and Brian Lara in the first over of a Champions Trophy match in Sharjah in 1997. 				 																																	Were not going to be daunted or fazed by any of the (big-name) players in the England side, said Brown, who plays for Warwickshire. We thoroughly respect them but were going to try and score and play to the best of our ability. 				 																																	Were not out there to be everyones whipping boys or just to make up the numbers. 				 																																	n West Indies vs Bangladesh live from 1:30 pm on Max n Taking Guard from 12:30 pm Star Sports n Follow Through on Star Sports after the match

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 This win more positive than ours
 Guest Column / Beishan Singh  Bedi Adelaide: Its a tremendous  victory. It is difficult to explain the import of what the  Indians have done, especially Rahul Dravid and V.V. S. Laxman.  Starting out tentatively, allowing the Aussies to score  556, and then recovering from the rut to this marvellous  victory. It was only natural to believe  the Indians wanted to save the game. Hence no amount of  credit to Dravid and Laxman is enough. Look at Dravid. He  was always there  with the bat in both innings and with  his brilliant fielding. Id say Dravid and Laxman are at  this point the best batsmen on either side and that includes  Ricky Ponting and Sachin Tendulkar. These guys are in control,  they are winners. The mind does go back to Indias  first ever Test victory Down Under  that 1977 December-end  in Melbourne (India won by 222 runs). Yes, that was history  scripted under my captaincy, but I wouldnt want to make  any comparison, thats odious Then we were making a comeback  from a 0-2 series deficit (lost in Brisbane and Perth) and  in that Test the matchwinner was Bhagwat Chandrasekhar (six  for 52 in each innings). Here the guys have actually taken  a 1-0 lead, and the batting is what got them to it. Its  different, very different.  [India went on to win the fourth  Test too in Sydney, in that series, a fascinating innings  and two runs verdict, levelling the series 2-2. However,  the series was not salvaged, India losing the fifth at this  Adelaide Oval]. Of course, nobody expected Ajit  Agarkar to run through the innings. Of course the Aussie  batting has to take the blame, reckless, rash that the strokes  were. Ive never heard a person like John Buchanan come  out so strongly against the immaturity of the batting. Buchanan  is a man of very few words I hope the team doesnt sit on  this victory as they go over to Melbourne. I have always  maintained this Aussie squad is beatable, and we are now  in the we shall phase We shall win This mode of mind  is very important. I am looking forward keenly, but remember  that the Aussies will be thinking hard. Steve Waugh isnt  somebody who throws in his towel so easily, and each Australian  team member would want Steve to go out on a high. The Aussies did not treat the  Indian bowling on its merit, so they perished. That is unlikely  to be the case in the remaining Tests. There is no room for complacency.  If Brett Lee is back in Melbourne, it could spell danger.  Without them and sans Shane Warne, and with Jason Gillespie  not fit, this Aussie attack wasnt upto expectations. So  we should expect new things in Melbourne. Possibly it is necessary that  India too should push in a new element.  There is little room for change  in this Indian XI, but Murali Kartik and Anil Kumble are  the musts, as I have already said. Drop Irfan Pathan, and  I hope Zaheer Khan is fit, and one never knows what Agarkar  can do. There is a big variety in this combination, good  to fox the Aussies. It is good that Sachin is still  in the game, despite being none-too-impressive with the  bat. Look at the wickets he took, providing the vital breakthroughs.  The team spirit is high. One word for Dravid and Laxman:  they must start asserting themselves. That probably is their  difference today with the likes of a Ponting or a Tendulkar.  The two are mild now. As soon as Sachin or Ponting are on  top they totally dominate the bowling. Dravid and Laxman  are so sound technically, its time they moved into the domination  zone. Needs a little courage, but that they have. Every team member should behave  as if he is the skipper. That way Sourav Gangulys responsibility  is shared, and the momentum grows. And between this, without malice,  let me say that Parthiv Patel needs a talking to. He has  grown up, and the earlier he realises this the better. Persist  with him, I am all for a specialist wicketkeeper, but let  him know his responsibilities. Last but not the least, I am happy  the Aussie media has been shut up. They fail to give any  credit to us. Today they can speak in only one voice, praising  the Indian victory. Copyright

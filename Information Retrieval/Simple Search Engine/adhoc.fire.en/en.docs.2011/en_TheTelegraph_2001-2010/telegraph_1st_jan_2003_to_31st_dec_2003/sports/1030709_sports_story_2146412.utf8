 Bergkamp agent hits out at Arsenal
 Dennis Bergkamp has been offered a contract that is too embarrassing for words London: Dennis Bergkamps agent has dismissed the new contract Arsenal are offering the Dutch striker as too embarrassing for words. Bergkamp has reportedly been proposed a one year deal but on a lower salary than he was receiving before. His agent, Rob Jansen, told Tuesdays Evening Standard: The contract Arsenal have offered Dennis is too embarrassing for words. I am not going to make public the amount of money involved, but I want to say that this is not the way to deal with people. I still intend to get a good outcome from this situation but we are disappointed with the way Arsenal have behaved. Bergkamp, who is in The Netherlands until his future is resolved, had hoped to finish out his career at Highbury and was intending to put pen to paper on a new deal back in May. The 34-year-old made 79 appearances for his country and played at the World Cup, said at the time: The boss (Arsene Wenger) told me months ago that he wanted to carry on with me for another season.  Bergkamp was a 7.5 million ($12 million) signing from Inter Milan in 1995.  (AFP)  Copyright

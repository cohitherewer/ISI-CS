 Fletcher agrees to new contract
London: Duncan Fletcher has agreed a new contract as England cricket coach, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced on Tuesday. A spokesperson said it was a standard contract with no specified expiry date. Fletcher had previously been given fixed-term contracts by England. Fletcher told a news conference: Im really pleased. Everything has been agreed. I am now contracted with the ECB. I was previously contracted on a year-to-year basis. It doesnt really make a difference but it gives me a lot of confidence. It gives you long-term planning. Former Zimbabwe batsmanFletcher took charge of the team in 1999. His previous contract was due to run out at the end of the English 2004 season. The decision to move Duncan from a fixed-term contract to a staff contract demonstrates the boards own commitment to him and his own commitment to the England cause, said ECB director of cricket operations John Carr.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lewis bout unofficial
Los Angeles: Britains Lennox Lewis will not be defending his World Boxing Council crown when he fights Canadas Kirk Johnson here June 21 and Mike Tyson is not yet signed to fight on the same heavyweight card. Those details were revealed here Thursday when promoters announced the fight card to be conducted at Staples Center, a venue secured in part because California agreed to provide Tyson with a licence to fight. Tyson is expected to fight Oleg Maskaev of Kazakhstan, but has not yet signed a contract for the fight, promoter Gary Shaw said.  (AFP)  Copyright

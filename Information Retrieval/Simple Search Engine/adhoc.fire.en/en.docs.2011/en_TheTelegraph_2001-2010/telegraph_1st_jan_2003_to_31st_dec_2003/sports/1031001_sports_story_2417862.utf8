		 Wednesday, October 01, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Paris: Out-of-favour Manchester United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez would like to return to France and Paris St Germain might consider such a move, PSGs president said on Tuesday.				 																																	Francis Graille said there had not been any recent contacts, adding: Its just a journalists idea but it is true that Barthez would like to return to France and what club would turn down Fabien Barthez?				 																																	However, Graille told French radio Europe 1 on Monday that Manchester United had offered to transfer Barthez to PSG in the close season. We were approached...several times in the summer, especially when we were discussing Ronaldinhos transfer, he said.				 																																	But the Parisian president made it clear that the club was for the time being satisfied with their two goalkeepers, Lionel Letizi and Jerome Alonzo. The suggestion that PSG could look for a third goalkeeper has been prompted by Letizis frequent injuries. 				 																																	Madrid: Real Mallorca sacked their Portuguese coach Jaime Pacheco on Tuesday, just five games into the Primera Liga season. Mallorca president Mateo Alemany said the decision had been taken for the good of the club at a three-hour board meeting on Monday night. Mallorca lie 16th in the 20-team Primera Liga after a 0-2 defeat by Albacete on Sunday left them with only four points from five games.				 																																	Paris: Racing Strasbourg defender Vaclav Drobny has been cited for doping by the French football federation, the Ligue 1 club said on Monday.				 																																	The federation has ordered the Czech to appear on October 15 after he tested positive for morphine, the teams website said.				 																																	I learned today that I have been summoned on October 15 ... in the light of a supposed doping case. I havent seen the charge sheet yet but I know that the substance detected is morphine, Drobny was quoted as saying on the website. The most plausible explanation seems to be that authorised products containing codeine can metabolise into morphine in the body. My advisers will seek expert advice. 				 																																	Melbourne: Australias Davis Cup final against Spain on November 28-30 will be played in Melbourne on a portable grass court, Tennis Australia (TA) announced on Tuesday.				 																																	The move is designed to favour Australias 2002 Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt and this years runner-up Mark Philippoussis. Spains world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero and former world No. 1 Carlos Moya are more at home on clay. 				 																																	Tennis Australia has confirmed the Davis Cup final between the Australian Davis Cup team and Spain will be played on natural grass at Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, a TA statement said. The portable grass court as used in the 2001 final between Australia and France will be transported from its current home in Seymour (near Melbourne) and installed over the Rebound Ace before November 19.  Liverpool: Danny Murphy has been ruled  out of action for three to four weeks after injuring ankle  ligaments following a late tackle by Kevin Campbell in a  reserve match against Everton.

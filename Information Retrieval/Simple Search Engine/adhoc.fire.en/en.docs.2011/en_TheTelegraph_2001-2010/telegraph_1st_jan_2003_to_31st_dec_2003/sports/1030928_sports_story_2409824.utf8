The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Second day washed out
Visakhapatnam, Sept. 27 (PTI): Heavy rains played spoilsport yet again, forcing abandonment of the second days play of the three-day cricket match between New Zealand and Board Presidents XI without a ball being bowled here on Saturday. Overnight showers had rendered the outfield at the ACA-VDCA stadium soggy, and a fresh spell of showers Saturday morning meant little prospects of resumption. Umpires Jasbir Singh and S. K. Sharma consulted New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming and his Board XI counterpart Virender Sehwag before calling it off for the day. Board Presidents XI were 23 without loss at the end of a truncated opening day.  Copyright

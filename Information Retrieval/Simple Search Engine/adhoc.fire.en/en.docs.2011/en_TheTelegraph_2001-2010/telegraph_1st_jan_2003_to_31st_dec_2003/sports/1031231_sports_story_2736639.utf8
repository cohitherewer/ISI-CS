The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Harbhajan may stay back for rehab
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Melbourne: Team India physio Andrew Leipus will be recommending to the Board that Harbhajan Singh, who recently underwent surgery on his right index finger, remain here for a further three weeks. That period will be utilised for extensive rehab, to allow the full range of movement. Ill be speaking to the Board president, as its important that Harbhajan gets back the full range of movement before returning home. After all, its a critical time till he achieves that and, any slip-up, could compromise the surgery, Leipus told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon. Incidentally, he has already put the offie on a gentle rehab but, in the coming weeks, that should be handled by a lady physio who has been recommended by the surgeon, Greg Hoy. Meanwhile, Leipus confirmed Zaheer Khan will be out for a minimum of four weeks. The scan, done on Monday, has revealed a left hamstring muscle tear. In order not to make it worse, the quick didnt bowl in the second innings of the third Test. According to manager Shivlal Yadav, Zaheer and the three others (Sadagopan Ramesh, Deep Dasgupta and Akash Chopra) are going to return home on January 8. They will be flying out from Sydney. The four ODI specialists  Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif, Hemang Badani and Sanjay Bangar  are arriving there on January 3.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sanjay Bangar hopes to keep berth in Tests vs NZ
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Tollygunges Sanjay Bangar in action during the P. Sen Trophy quarter final Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Much of Sanjay Bangars hope today rests on Tests. His performance, even in the last TVS Cup in Dhaka, has been less than satisfactory, but his persistent attitude, feel people in the know, could be suited for Tests. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the P. Sen Trophy where Bangar turned out for Tollygunge Agragami versus Eastern Railway despite himself being a Railwayman, Bangar said: yes, it was sad sitting out the World Cup, but I have been working on my bowling and I look forward to the New Zealand tour (in September-October) Tests. Thats where he expects to be around and stay. Ironically, it was during Indias disastrous tour of New Zealand that Bangar had logged low marks. Now he believes it will be New Zealand who would bring him back. Adrian Le Roux, the national team trainer, had given the requisite fitness chart to the players. I am following that sincerely, said Bangar. He expects this to yield good results whenhe faces the test for the Tests. He feels being in competition is the best thing for him, now, hence this P. Sen outing for the allrounder. This Eden stint is comfortable for me, he said. I know the ground here, and hence am having little problem adjusting. Anyway, this is a good way to keep in touch. The 10 overs here went off pretty smoothly, and I liked it. Tollygunge in semi-final In the P. Sen meet, Tollygunge moved into the semi-finals, beating Eastern Railway by seven wickets. They take on East Bengal in the last four Saturday. The day before that, Mohun Bagan are to meet Kalighat in the other semi-final. Railway decided to bat and hit a modest 144 or nine in their 50 overs, Aranyadeb Sarkar scoring an unbeaten 40. Bangar picking up three wickets for 24 runs and Avinash Kumar took three for 16. Bangar had just one maiden, though. Tollygunge hit up the requisite 145 in just 32.5 overs, losing three wickets. Arindam Das scored a fine 51, and Kunal Bajpai was also going strong, but soon after crossing the half-century mark he had to return to the pavilion, thoroughly dehydrated in the searing heat. Brief scores Eastern Railway 144/9 in 50 ovs (A Sarkar 40 n.o.; S Bangar 3/24, A Kumar 3/16). Tollygunge 145/3 in 32.5 ovs (Arindam Das 51, Kunal Bajpai retd hurt (dehydration) 54, Bangar 4 n.o.).

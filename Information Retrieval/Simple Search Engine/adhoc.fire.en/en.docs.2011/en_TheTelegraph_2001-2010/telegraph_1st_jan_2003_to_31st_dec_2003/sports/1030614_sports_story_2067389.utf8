The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Umpires want more pay
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The CAB umpires have demanded a pay-hike for the forthcoming season. One of the senior umpires informed that there hasnt been a hike for the last three seasons and they have already placed their demand to the finance committee. Currently the Grade I umpires are paid an unsubstantial Rs 200 per match, with a 10 per cent allowance for matches on week-days.  New training methods Taking a cue from East Bengal, the CAB management has decided to include swimming in their daily training curriculum. Currently 11 players are undergoing physical conditioning, looked after by their trainer Shayne Nyss. These swimming sessions will start at the Ordnance Club from Sunday, an official said. The CAB has also decided to make two new turf practice wickets beside the Pankaj Gupta Indoor Stadium. The players suffer from cramps in the closed atmosphere of the Indoor Stadium, he said. Meanwhile, Nyss will attend the physios seminar in Bangalore, to be conducted by Andrew Leipus on July 1 and 2.  Copyright

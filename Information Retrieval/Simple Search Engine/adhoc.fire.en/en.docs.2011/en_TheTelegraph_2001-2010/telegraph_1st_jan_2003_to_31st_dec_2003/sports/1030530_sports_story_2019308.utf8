The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hunt on to take pressure off Dravid: Sourav
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly on Thursday said the team management and selectors were looking for a full time wicketkeeper to take the pressure off Rahul Dravid. Dravid was always a part-time option... Selectors are giving opportunity to others, but the contenders must stand up and perform as Dravid has done, Sourav said. The selectors are, however, in no hurry as the next season begins only in October, he added. On Parthiv Patel, the skipper said, The selectors have given him a chance to prove his worth in India As England tour. But Patel has to prove his batting potential to earn a place in the senior national side, he said. The Indian skipper will leave for London Friday morning for father Chandis bypass surgery. Joining him will be his mother, wife Dona and daughter Sana. The bypass will be done by Dr John Wright, who had operated on Chandi earlier, at Princess Grace Hospital in London. The date hasnt been fixed.  Copyright

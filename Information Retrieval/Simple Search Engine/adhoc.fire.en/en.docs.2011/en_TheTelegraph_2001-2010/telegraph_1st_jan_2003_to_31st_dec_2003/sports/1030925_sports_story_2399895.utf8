The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Even a draw vs Aussies would be huge: Streak
Perth: Simply achieving a draw against world champions Australia in Octobers two-Test series would be a significant triumph, Zimbabwe skipper Heath Streak said here Wednesday. Obviously, you never walk on the park without the expectation of trying to win  thats the prime objective, he said after Zimbabwes arrival here to prepare for Tests in Perth and Sydney. But I think for us, to be realistic, if we can set our goals to walk away with a draw it would be a huge achivement. If we have the opportunity to win, obviously we are going to go for it, but thats the way I look at it. I believe it is going to be a huge learning curve for a lot of us on this tour. If we can take some big positives out of this tour, Zimbabwe cricket will be the better for it. Hopefully, we can come back in a couple of years time as a more experienced side and one that can maybe play in a three-Test series. Streak, who leads one of the least experienced sides fielded by Zimbabwe, said he was sure the teams fighting spirit would pull them through their first Test tour of Australia. We have always tended to lift when we play the top sides, so hopefully we can do that again, he said. We enjoy being the underdogs, but the guys do not enjoy losing, so they dont want to be embarrassed  they will be going out there and giving it their best during this series. It was frustrating that Zimbabwe would be without the Flower brothers, Andy and Grant, and other quality players, Streak said. Andy Flower has quit Zimbabwe after his controversial protest during this years World Cup against his governments human rights record. Grant, the sides most accomplished remaining batsman, has been ruled out of the current tour with a broken thumb  a setback Zimbabwe coach Geoff Marsh described as a huge blow. Murray Goodwin, who now plays with Western Australia  as well as in the English County championship  was not chosen for the tour because of past differences with the Zimbabwe management. Its pointless looking behind, Streak said. We always have to look to the future.  (AFP)  Copyright

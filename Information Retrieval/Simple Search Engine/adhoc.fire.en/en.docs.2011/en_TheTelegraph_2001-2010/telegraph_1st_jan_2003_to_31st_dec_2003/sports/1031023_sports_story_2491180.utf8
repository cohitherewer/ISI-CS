The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leander calls on Sourav 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Star visitors poured into the city clinic where Sourav Ganguly is admitted even as the India captain continued to make satisfactory progress following surgeries on his left upper thigh. Leander Paes, accompanied by his father, was by Souravs bedside in the evening, within six hours of checking into his Beckbagan residence. The tennis star, recovering from a parasitic infection in his brain, flew in for a two-day hometown visit this morning and spent 15 minutes with good friend Sourav. Asked whether these are bad times for top sporting stars from the city, Leander was quick to retort: Well definitely be back soon I have known Sourav long, I know his spirit. This is the charm of Bengal, we have a lot of character. Praising the Sourav, Leander said: He is a brilliant captain, the team needs him. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee and actor-politician Tapas Pal also called on Sourav. The doctors treating Sourav, after this mornings dressing, were satisfied with the healing of the wound, according to a medical bulletin from the clinic. On Thursday, Dr Ram Subramaniam, a specialist on infections, will see Souravs wound while the regular dressing is done. The Chennai-based Dr Subramaniam, who is attached with the Apollo Hospital, has been flown in by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to get a second opinion. He (Dr Subramaniam) has nothing to do with the treatment, we just want him to have a look at the wound. We dont want to take any chances, thats why we want a second opinion, said Jagmohan Dalmiya. He also informed that Souravs file has been sent to Dr Anant Joshi, the BCCI doctor who is based in Mumbai.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ex-Ranji player killed in mob fury
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Guwahati: Former Assam Ranji Trophy player Izaz Hussain died last night of injuries sustained in a mob attack inside the public bus terminus in Tezpur. Hussain, an all-rounder who had had a three-year stint at the MRF Pace Foundation, was in his late twenties. Sonitpur superintendent of police Satyen Gogoi told The Telegraph that Hussain was stabbed by a group of drivers, handymen and ticket agents. They were annoyed with him for running his travel business in a manner that allegedly clashed with their interests. Hussain died at the Tezpur Civil Hospital around 9.30 pm, the police official said. Hussain made a debut against Tripura during the 1992-93 session. He was managing a Sumo rental counter adjacent to the public bus terminus. A mob of bus employees attacked him with sharp weapons after an altercation. The culprits are absconding, but we have rounded up several of their accomplices for interrogation, Gogoi said.

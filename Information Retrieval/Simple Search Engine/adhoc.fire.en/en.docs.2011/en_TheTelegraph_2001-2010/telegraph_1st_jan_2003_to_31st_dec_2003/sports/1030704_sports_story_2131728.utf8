 Ban on 1-dayers for U-17 okayed
 - BCCI accepts spinners panel recommendations New Delhi: Acting on the recommendation of prominent spinners of yesteryear, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Thursday announced a ban on one-day matches for juniors till the age of 17. BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya told reporters here that working committee, on the second and final day of its meeting here, had accepted all the three recommendations of the spinners panel with a view to promote spin bowling in the country. We have decided to accept all three recommendations. As such, we have decided that there would be no one-day cricket for teams upto under-17 level, Dalmiya said. The other two recommendations pertain to conducting regular workshops for spinners at the zonal level and inviting former spin greats to come and train the youngsters at NCA. Dalmiya, however, clarified that India would participate in the Asia Cup under-17 tournament, a one-day event, this year. We are to host that tournament and as such we cannot go back on our commitment. But after the tournament we intend to approach the Asian Cricket Council to request that henceforth Asia Cup be made a two-day event, Dalmiya said. Dalmiya also announced the acceptance, in principle, of the suggestions made by the captains and coaches of the Ranji Trophy teams to improve the quality of domestic cricket. Dalmiya said the recommendations had been sent to the technical committee for consideration. He said the working committee had also given its approval to the suggestion to invite a maximum of two foreign teams to play in the Duleep Trophy.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Harbhajan may not need surgery now
Mumbai: India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh may not need surgery to rectify a long-term finger injury in his bowling hand, his doctor said on Tuesday. Dr Anant Joshi, the Indian specialist who has been treating him, said Harbhajan had responded to physiotherapy after consulting a specialist in Melbourne last week and been able to bowl long sessions in the nets without discomfort. Harbhajan was feeling better after physiotherapy, he said, explaining the reasons for deciding against surgery. Joshi said the surgery had been scheduled for last Tuesday and added: He may not need it at all...He is very happy and relieved. Harbhajan was advised to undergo surgery last month to rectify a ligament injury in the knuckle jint of his middle finger, attributed mainly to his tight bowling grip. He managed to play in the World Cup and a subsequent tri-series, but the injury forced him last month to cancel his proposed stint with County side Lancashire. (Reuters)  Copyright

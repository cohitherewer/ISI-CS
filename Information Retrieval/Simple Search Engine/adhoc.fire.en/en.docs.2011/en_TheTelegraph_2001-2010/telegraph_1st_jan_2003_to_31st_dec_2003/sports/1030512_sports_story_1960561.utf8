The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Steves India dream still alive 
 Steve Waugh is sure to keep his place for some time more New Delhi: Even on the verge of a historic clean sweep in the West Indies by his all-conquering side, Australian captain Steve Waugh has not lost sight of his dream  to win a Test series in India. Its a long way away but... We havent won there for a long time. Those tours loom as significant ones for Australian cricket, said Waugh, whose side would tour India next year with the hope of breaking a 35-year hoodoo on Indian soil. Australia have not won a Test series in India since 1969. They visited India last in 2001 on the back of a world record sequence of 15 consecutive Test victories and even won the first match in Mumbai, only to be stopped by an extra-ordinary performance from V. V. S. Laxman in the second Test in Calcutta. The Australians went on to lose that three-match series 1-2. I just try and learn from what happened and try and do the best we can now, Waugh was quoted as saying by a website. However, Waugh, 38, who has since been dropped from the Australian one-day squad, insisted he was not driven to atone for past events. I never look back and think, we shouldve won that series or Ive got to make up for it now. But what he was sure of was that he was going to continue in the team for some more time. Im not going to go through the retirement stuff again. I had enough of that for 12 or 18 months, Waugh said. Having scored six hundreds in all forms of cricket this year, Waugh has the form to continue and he insisted there also were reasons to support a case for his continuing. There are always different challenges. You can have personal ones or team ones. It doesnt have to be a series or an opponent, other things can still challenge you. It may even be the type of pitch youre playing on, or the conditions that confront you if you havent seen them before and you want to try to overcome them.  (PTI)  Copyright

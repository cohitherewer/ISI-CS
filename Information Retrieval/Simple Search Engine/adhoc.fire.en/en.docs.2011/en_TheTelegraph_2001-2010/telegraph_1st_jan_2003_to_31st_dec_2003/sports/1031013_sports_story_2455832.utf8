The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA humble Pak in series decider
 - Proteas record 7-wkt victory as hosts falter  Mohammed Hafeez is bowled by Andre Nel in Rawalpindi on Sunday Rawalpindi: Boeta Dippenaar hit a patient 74 to set the foundation for South Africas seven wicket-win over Pakistan on Sunday to clinch the fifth and final one-day International and take the series 3-2. It was South Africas third win-in-a-row and came in the absence of skipper Graeme Smith and Andrew Hall, both suspended for breaching the ICCs Code of Conduct in the second match at Lahore. Chasing 193 to win after a disciplined bowling performance, Dippenaar, whose runs came from 125 balls, shared in two half-century stands with Herschelle Gibbs (34) and Jacques Kallis (40). He added 75 with Gibbs, who was smartly stumped by Rashid Latif off leg-spinner Danish Kaneria, then another 93 from 125 balls with Kallis. The in-form Dippenaar, with knocks of 110 and 58 earlier in the series, fell leg before in the 40th over to paceman Mohammed Sami but Jacques Rudolph (13) and Neil McKenzie (9) guided the tourists home with 4.1 overs to spare. It was a crunch game for us and I think Kallis and Boeta laid the foundation for the win. But our bowlers were spectacular upfront and we played with maturity, said stand-in South Africa skipper Mark Boucher, leading the side for the first time in a one-day International. Our batting was not under pressure after bowling out Pakistan for a low score. We knew that it would be difficult to chase under lights here and the only way for us to win was to do well in bowling and we did that. Pakistan lost their first five wickets for 80 runs. Abdul Razzaq with 38, Rashid Latif 25, Shoaib Malik 20 from 29 balls and Sami 22 from 30 put together partnerships in the second half of the innings to add 112 runs. Shaun Pollock took three for 33 and there were two wickets apiece for Robin Peterson and Andre Nel. Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq said his team had been short by at least 40 runs after batting first. I dont think we supported our bowlers on this pitch. But overall I am satisfied with the way the younger players have performed in the series.  Support for Smith South Africas youngest-ever captain Smith will take the game forward and learn from his mistakes despite being reprimanded for his recent conduct, chief selector Omar Henry said. After the World Cup, it was a very difficult decision to appoint a young captain like Smith but the characteristics of the young man, fortunately spotted and backed up by everyone, led to the decision, Henry said.

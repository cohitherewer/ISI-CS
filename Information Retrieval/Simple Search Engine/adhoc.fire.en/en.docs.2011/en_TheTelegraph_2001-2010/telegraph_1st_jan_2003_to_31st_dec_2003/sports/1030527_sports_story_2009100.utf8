 Chandhok triumphs at Silverstone
 Chandhok overcame stiff challenge to pole position New Delhi: Formula 3 driver Karun Chandhok came up with a brilliant performance to win the British championship (scholarship) class at the Silverstone Grand Prix circuit Sunday. Chandhok completed the race in 26 minute 54.62 seconds, an impressive 6.43 seconds ahead of his teammate and second placed Steven Kane of Great Britain. The third spot went to Christian England, also of Great Britain, who finished 17.9 seconds behind the Indian. Chennai-born Chandhok, who finished third in the official test session on Friday, had fought off stiff competition from Kane and Ernesto Viso in the first two qualifying sessions on Saturday to record pole positions, according to information received here. On the race day, the Indian got off to a flier zooming ahead of Kane soon after the start. On the way to the title, he recorded the fastest lap of the race at 1 minute 46.52 seconds to bag a championship point at Silverstone, considered one of the best Formula 1 circuits in the world. An elated Chandhok said after the race: The car was really good right through the race and I was able to be consistent all through. (PTI)  Copyright

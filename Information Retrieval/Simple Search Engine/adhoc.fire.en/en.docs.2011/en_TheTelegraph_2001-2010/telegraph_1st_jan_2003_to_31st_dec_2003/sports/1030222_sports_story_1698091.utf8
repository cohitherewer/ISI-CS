Durban: More than half of the New Zealand side was involved in a brawl outside a nightclub early on Friday which saw Chris Cairns being assaulted and suffering a cut lip. Cairns was felled on the ground after being hit from behind without warning, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said. Cairns and nine other teammates, including captain Stephen Fleming and vice-captain Craig McMillan were rushed to their hotel by armed security guards provided by the World Cup organisers to protect the players. New Zealand team manager Jeff Crowe said Cairns injury was not serious. The incident happened outside the nightclub. Cairns had been asked to leave the nightclub by bar staff after reported loud behaviour by several members of the team, he said in a statement. Crowe said the players, who are resting here after refusing to travel to Kenya for their league match, had his permission for the night out. Others involved included Andre Adams, Scott Styris, Daniel Vettori, Brendon McCullum, Jacob Oram and Kyle Mills. NZC inquiry Meanwhile, NZC has launched an inquiry into the safety and behaviour of its players after the incident.

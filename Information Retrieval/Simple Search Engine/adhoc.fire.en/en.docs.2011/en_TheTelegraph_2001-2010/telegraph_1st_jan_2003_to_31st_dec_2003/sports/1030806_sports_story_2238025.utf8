The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lehmann, Lee rested 
Darwin: Australian selectors spared the Bangladeshi batsmen some concern by resting Brett Lee for Wednesdays series-ending ODI. Lee, who snared four wickets in the first ODI, will be replaced by pace spearhead Jason Gillespie. Brad Williams will start for this first time in the series while Darren Lehmann gets a rest. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting said Lee deserved a break after intimidating the Bangladeshis during the 2-0 Test series win and the opening two limited-overs Internationals. Ponting wants to bat first in Darwin in order to bat through 50 overs. If the wickets good Ill bat first every time. Bangladesh were expected to announce a line-up tomorrow. Australia: Adam Gilchrist, Matthew Hayden, Ricky Ponting (captain), Damien Martyn, Michael Bevan, Andrew Symonds, Ian Harvey, Brad Hogg, Andrew Bichel, Jason Gillespie, Brad Williams. 12th man: Brett Lee.

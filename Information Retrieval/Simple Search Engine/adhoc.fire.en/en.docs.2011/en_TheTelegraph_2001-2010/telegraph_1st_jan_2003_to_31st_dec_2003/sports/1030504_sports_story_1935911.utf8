 2-year ban on Ulihrach 
Ponte Vedra Beach, May 3 (Reuters): Czech tennis player Bohdan Ulihrach awaits a heavy punishment for testing positive for the steroid nandrolone, the ATP announced on Friday. Ulihrach will receive a two-year suspension retroactive to October 26, a fine of $43,770 and a forfeiture of 100 ranking points after an independent tennis anti-doping programme tribunal determined that his urine sample taken at the Moscow tournament on October 3 tested positive for metabolites of nandrolone, a class 1 banned substance.

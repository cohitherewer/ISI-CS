				 																																	London: Britains Paula Radcliffe will compete at next months IAAF world half marathon championships in Vilamoura, Portugal, British officials said on Friday.				 																																	Radcliffe, the world marathon record holder, will contest the shorter distance on October 4.				 																																	The Briton, who has twice won the world half marathon title, set a European record of 66:47 in Bristol in 2001.				 																																	Radcliffe returned to competition with victory in a 10 km event in London on Saturday, having pulled out of last months world championships in Paris because of injury and illness.

Juan Margets was also re-elected ITF executive vice president while David Jude will serve again as honorary treasurer.				 																																	Beijing: World No. 1 Timo Boll of Germany was bundled out of the China Open table tennis championships at the first hurdle on Friday, falling to Chinas Chen Qi.

The biennial fixture was initially scheduled to be played over two legs in March and April but the AFC postponed the competition due to the war in Iraq.

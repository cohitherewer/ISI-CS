 Sami, Hafeez star in Pak win
Lahore: Youngsters Mohammad Sami and Mohammad Hafeez inspired Pakistan to a comfortable 42-run victory over South Africa in the second one-day International on Sunday. The hosts won the first match of the series on Friday by eight runs. It was the first time since 1994-95 that Pakistan had recorded back-to-back one-day wins over South Africa, who had won 25 of the last 36 matches between the sides. South Africa, chasing a target of 268, were cruising on 108 for one after 22 overs when Sami and Hafeez triggered a middle-order collapse. The visitors lost six wickets for just 60 runs. Four South African batsmen fell in 47 balls as Sami effected two brilliant run-outs fielding inside the circle and Hafeez took three wickets. South Africa were eventually restricted to 225 for nine in 50 overs, last-wicket pair Alan Dawson (23) and Makhaya Ntini (16) posting an unbeaten partnership of 38. Opener Hafeez, who has scored just 120 in his last seven matches, bowled 10 overs for 37 runs while Sami returned to wipe up the tail and finish with figures of three for 20. South Africa, again without Herschelle Gibbs, were well served by Boeta Dippenaar (58) and Jacques Kallis (42). The pair shared a second-wicket stand of 89 from 106 balls before disaster struck.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sporting enter phase II
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: Tata Football Academy held Mohammedan Sporting goalless in a National Football League second division match at the JRD Tata Sports Complex Wednesday. With this draw, the black-and-white brigade ended the eastern leg with seven points and qualify for the second phase starting in Jamshedpur from March 26. TFA, with five, also qualify and will play in Trivandrum. TFA controlled the proceedings in the first-half, marred by some rough play. But for a thigh injury to centre forward Malswama in the eighth minute, TFA could have made some more attempts at the opposition goal. The wily striker found himself in a scoring position following a pass from the left-flank, but Bhuvan Joshi struck him hard from behind. With a swelling in his thigh, Malswama had to be taken off and the other striker Zehry Zirasanga did not get enough support thereafter. The Calcutta team resorted to rough play and three of their players  Joshi, Amandeep Singh and Awal Ibrahim were booked while Zirsanga got a yellow for TFA. The Mohammedan Sporting defence did not allow too much leeway to the TFA attackers, who were desperate to break the deadlock. The visitors, however, organised themselves well in the second session and initiated some fine moves. They played short passes in the preparatory zone and tried to break the TFA defensive wall. Left-winger Praveen Rawats attempt at the goal was negated in the 54th minute while Rahim Nabis right-footer went astray in the 60th. Mohammedan Sporting could force a lead ten minutes later, but Ibrahim, after going past a couple of TFA defenders, shot wide.  Copyright

 ICC plans to simplify procedure
  London: The ICC has decided to review its process of tackling bowlers with illegal action in a bid to simplify the entire procedure.The decision, taken on the first day of week-long meetings of ICCs Cricket Committee-Management (CC-M), is aimed at making it a one-stage process with the reported player being directly dealt with by the ICCs bowling review group.Earlier, the bowler was first handed over to the home board for remedial measures and only if that proved unsuccessful did the ICC step in.The following are the other decisions taken by the committee:

Tackling Illegal bowling action:

- The concept of neutral umpires will be continued with, rejecting the suggestion of moving away from appointing them to a situation where appointments from the Elite Panel could be made irrespective of their nationality.- Players found guilty of using illegal bats would be charged with a level 2 breach of ICCs Code of Conduct. The fine for such a breach could be the entire match fee and a one-Test or two-ODI ban. It also prescribed penalties for manufacturers which included deleting their name from the approved list.The committee took the decisions on recommendations received from the Cricket Committee-Playing (CC-P) which deals with on-field matters.The CC-P is chaired by Sunil Gavaskar and includes Zaheer Abbas, Tim May, Angus Fraser and Errol Stewart.The meeting, chaired by ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed, also received a briefing on the status of the Global Cricket Corporations compensation claim against the ICC regarding the World Cup. The issue will now be raised for further discussion at the meeting of the board of the ICCs commercial arm in Monaco Friday.The ICC management also initiated a discussion on the amount of cricket being played at present and the structure of the international game. The discussion will continue at the executive board meeting on Thursday. (PTI)  Copyright

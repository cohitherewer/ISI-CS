 Puzzle solved, Els takes a break
London: World No. 2 Ernie Els, relieved to have rediscovered his winning touch in Switzerland on Sunday, is looking forward to a two-week break before he competes in his last two European Tour events of the year. The 33-year-old South African, who clinched his sixth title of the season in the European Masters at Crans-sur-Sierre, plans to work on his chipping before returning to tournament action at the Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland later this month. My game these past few months has been a case of nearly, but not quite, Els said on his official website. I felt like I was close to winning form but, for some reason, I couldnt put it together over four days. But I finally solved that puzzle in Switzerland and it feels good, added the three-time Major champion, whose previous victory this year came at the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond in July. Having played five consecutive tournaments, three in the States and two in Europe, I was just about ready for a couple of weeks off at home. The break is going to feel even sweeter after my win in Switzerland. Els fired a closing six-under-par 65 on Sunday to finish six shots clear of second-placed Michael Campbell of New Zealand, with Argentine Eduardo Romero a further stroke back in third. He imposed his authority with four early birdies to overhaul overnight leader Romero but, despite producing red-hot form with his putter, was disappointed with the quality of his chipping. Mostly, my game felt good, but my chipping was absolutely shocking, the worst I can remember it, in fact, he said. Thats one thing Ill have to really work on in the next couple of weeks.  Els victory in Switzerland earned him the 15th European Tour title of his career and his 46th worldwide. (Reuters)  Copyright

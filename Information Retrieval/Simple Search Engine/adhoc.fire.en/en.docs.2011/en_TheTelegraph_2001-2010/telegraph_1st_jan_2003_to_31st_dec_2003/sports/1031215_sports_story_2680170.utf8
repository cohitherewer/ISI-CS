 Surya maintains sole lead
Kozhikode: GM Surya Shekhar Ganguly of PSPB trounced teammate T. S. Ravi to record his fifth victory in a row and maintain his sole lead on 13 points after the 16th round of the 41st national A chess championship here Sunday. Surya, who beat M. Srinivas Rao earlier in the day in round 15, was leading nearest rival Sandipan Chanda by two points. GM Koneru Humpy was in a drawing position with Andhra teammate GM P. Harikrishna. Humpy is likely to join Sandipan at second slot. The third position was shared by GM Abhijit Kunte (PSPB) who gave an emphatic display of power chess to beat seasoned GM Pravin Thipsay of BSB. Abhijit, on 10.5 points, was likely to have the company of Harikrishna. Surya was again in full swing against Ravi who was up against a Ruy Lopez as black. Positionally inclined as Surya was, he chose a rather safe set-up as white and managed a miniscule advantage. Ravis position became increasingly difficult to handle once he allowed Surya to pressurise his queen side pawn weaknesses and it was soon curtains for him in the minor pieces endgame. Earlier in the day, Surya made most of his active position as black against M. Srinivas Rao of Andhra. The middle game, arising out of an irregular opening, gave Surya a slight advantage that he used well to come up triumphs. Kunte showed resilience in tackling Thipsay who consumed a lot of time in the middle game phase to fall under tremendous time pressure. Here too the opening was a Ruy Lopez where Thipsay, black, was saddled with a passive position following a slightly erroneous middle game plan. Guiding his knight to the sixth rank, Abhijit created enough threats against Thipsay and won in the queen and knight endgame. (PTI)  Copyright

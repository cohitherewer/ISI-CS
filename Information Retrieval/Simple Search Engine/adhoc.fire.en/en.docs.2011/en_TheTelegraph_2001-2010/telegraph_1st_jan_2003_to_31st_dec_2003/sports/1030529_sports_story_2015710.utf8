The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan thrash out a formula
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Three days before the inter-state transfers deadline gets over, Mohun Bagan seem to have thrashed out a formula. Two of the special officers appointed by the High Court to look after matters related to football, Shyamal Sen and Umesh Banerjee, nominated advocate Shiboprasad Mukherjee and Mohun Bagan football convenor Debashish Dutta to take charge of the signing of the players. The third special officer, Indrajit Sen, is currently out of station. The special officers also made it clear that United Mohun Bagan Football Team Private Limited can operate on its own terms and conditions. The decision was taken at a meeting held at Banerjees residence where members of the current executive committee and the dissident faction, as well as representatives of McDowell India Company Ltd were present. Later Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra, who is also the managing director of United Mohun Bagan Team Private Ltd, said: In the meeting, the special officers asked if anyone was ready to sponsor the club. But no one came up, he said. Therefore it was decided that McDowell should be allowed to work under the old terms and conditions. He also added that the case regarding the formation of a company with McDowell is still pending in a lower court and it will be sorted out later. Though McDowell India officials didnt want to comment on the issue, Dutta said: I have been promised by the United Breweries officials that that they will clear the money that is still pending. The sponsors have already cleared Rs 60 lakh of the promised Rs1.55 crore for the season. However, Dutta made it clear that they will start with the team building process from Thursday. The minutes of todays meeting will come to us on Thursday and we will take up the matter straightaway. He also promised that the outstation players who had been confirmed will be signed very soon. This includes Brazilian Marcos Perreira of Vasco. We hope to get his inter-state clearance by Friday, Dutta added.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, December 20, 2003  Tinto may win in Bangalore 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 R. Byramji				 										Bangalore: Rio Tinto, who went down fighting to Saratoga Sizzle in his last start may do better in the 1,400m Delhi Race Club Cup on Saturday here. However, the Rashid Byramji-ward may again face serious challenge from his vanquisher and also from Refresher and Star Alone. But the allowance claimed by his partner M. Mark, an up and coming apprentice may stand him in good stead.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2 pm: Path Of Honour 1. Power Of Dreams 2. Heat Wave 3.				 										2.30 pm: Good Hope 1.

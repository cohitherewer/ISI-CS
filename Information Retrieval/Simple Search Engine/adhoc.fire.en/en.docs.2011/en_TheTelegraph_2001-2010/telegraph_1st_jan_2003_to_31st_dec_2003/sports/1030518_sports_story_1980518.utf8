 Mohinders stint ends
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta, May 17: Mohinder  Amarnaths five-day stint with trainees at the zonal wing  of the National Cricket Academy (NCA) came to an end Saturday. Watching video tapes of what happened over the last few days with the youngsters was on agenda on the last day and Amarnath received an emotional farewell with several trainees touching his feet, while some others rushed to record the moment on camera. The boys seemed eager. But because they come from different areas, not all are exposed to the use of modern and sophisticated methods, noted the pillar of the 1983 World Cup-winning Indian team, who was here as NCA batting consultant. They need to be regularly in touch with such things like watching replays of their own game and analysing them. Because they are young, they can catch up, signed off Jimmy, before rushing to catch the flight to Mumbai. At the moment, Amarnath does not know whether or when he will return for another session with the east zone trainees.  Copyright

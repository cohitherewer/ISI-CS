 - THIRD ODI vs PAKISTAN - D/L formula gives South Africa 13-run victory  Jacques Kallis has his middle stump uprooted by a Shoaib Akhtar yorker in Faisalabad on Tuesday. (Reuters) Faisalabad: South Africa won the third one-day International by 13 runs at the Iqbal Stadium here on Tuesday after Pakistan failed to complete their quota of 50 overs in the stipulated time of three-and-a-half hours. Under the Duckworth/Lewis formula, South Africa only had to score 208 for six after 45 overs to win. The visitors were 221 for six at the end of 45 overs. Amid failing light, Australian umpire Darrell Hair and Pakistans Nadeem Ghauri offered batsmen Shaun Pollock and Andrew Hall the option of ending the match according to the formula, which they accepted. South Africas victory narrowed the gap in the five-match series to 2-1. Pakistan made 243 for eight off their 50 overs. Half centuries by Jacques Kallis and captain Graeme Smith gave South Africa a solid start as they hammered Pakistan all over the park in the first 17 overs. Kallis made 62 and Smith 51 and were especially harsh on pacer Umar Gul and Saqlain Mushtaq. Gul was whacked for 42 off his five overs, while Smith hit Saqlain for three boundaries in one over to take 24 in the off-spinners first two overs. Herschelle Gibbs, fully recovered from his pulled stomach muscle injury, didnt last long in his first game of the series. He hit express bowler Shoaib Akhtar for a boundary before the pacer found an outside edge off the next delivery. However, Smith and Kallis added 100 runs off 111 balls. Razzaq gave Pakistan a breakthrough when Smith  after hitting 51 off 55 balls with eight fours  got an edge. Kallis was struck on his back off a vicious Akhtar full toss but failed to bring his bat down in time, knocking the middle-stump out of the ground. Kallis made 62 off 80 balls and hit eight fours and a six. Jacques Rudolph (46) and Mark Boucher (24) added 49 runs for the fifth wicket before both fell at the same total of 206 as the light started to fade. Rudolph holed out in the deep to a diving Razzaq while Bouchers off-stump was knocked by Akhtar. However, soon after Pakistans three-and-a-half hours of bowling time had passed, the umpires offered the light to Pollock and Hall, who walked back to the dressing room with their team 13 runs ahead on the Duckworth/Lewis Formula. Earlier, Makhaya Ntini took three wickets for 45 after Pakistans stand-in captain Yousuf Youhana elected to bat first. Only opener Yasir Hameed and Razzaq played significant knocks of 72 and an unbeaten 46 off 38 balls, respectively, as the other batsmen struggled. South Africa struck regularly once Hall got the breakthrough in the 16th over. Hameed and Mohammed Hafeez (20) put on 52 runs for the first wicket before Dippenaar took a brilliant catch of Hafeez while running backward from cover. Ntini claimed the prized wicket of in-form Youhana, who scored half centuries in the first two games. The right-handed batsman hit three boundaries in his brief knock of 18 before edging to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. Ntini also removed the dangerous Shoaib Malik (28) and clean-bowled Akhtar to end as the best South African bowler. Hameed, who raised his half century off 89 balls, started to flourish before giving Gibbs an easy catch in the 30th over and Peterson one of his two wickets. Hameeds knock included eight fours and came off 105 balls.  Peterson bowled seven overs and  took two wickets for 26.  (AP)  Copyright

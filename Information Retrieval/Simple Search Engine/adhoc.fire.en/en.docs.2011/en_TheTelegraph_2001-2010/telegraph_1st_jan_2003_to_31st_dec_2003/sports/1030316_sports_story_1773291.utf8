The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Four-point advantage for Asians
Shenzhen: Asia put up a spectacular display of golf on the second day of the inaugural Phoenix Dynasty Cup to open up a four-point lead going into the final days singles matches at the World Cup course of the Mission Hill Golf Club here Saturday. Except for the opening Asian pair of Thammanoon Srirot and Thaworn Wiratchant, who lost 2 and 3 to Tommy Nakajima and Hajime Meshiai, each of the remaining five Asian pairs won their four-ball matches. That gave Asia eight points to Japans four. Indias Jyoti Randhawa played aggressive golf as he and Charlie Wi of Korea emerged the biggest winners of the day, beating Taichi Teshima and Katsunori Kuwabara by five holes with four to play. Randhawa was eight-under for the 14 holes when Asia wrapped up the match. The pairing of Jeev Milkha Singh and Arjun Atwal looked like finishing up their match against Hiroki Fujita and Keiichiro Fukabori in a hurry when they went four-up after just six holes. However, one bad hole for the Indians made it much closer before Jeev produced a peach of a second shot on the par-4 17th (a sandwedge no less than a feet) to close the match 2 and 1 in Asias favour.

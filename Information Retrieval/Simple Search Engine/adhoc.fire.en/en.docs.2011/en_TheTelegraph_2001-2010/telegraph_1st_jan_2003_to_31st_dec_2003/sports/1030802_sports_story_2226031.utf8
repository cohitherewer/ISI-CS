The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India A forced to follow on
London: India A were trailing Warwickshire by 286 runs after being bowled out for 181 in the first innings in the four-day match at Edgbaston on Friday. Following on, the visitors were 70 for no loss in their second innings, with Wasim Jaffer on 32 and captain Shiv Sundar Das on 22 at close on Day 2. Warwickshire had piled up a mammoth 537 in the first innings. Resuming at five for no loss, the Indian first innings lasted only 52.5 overs as their batsmen failed miserably on a pitch that had absorbed considerable amount of rain on Thursday. Only captain Shiv Sundar (51), southpaw Sridharan Sriram (41) and wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel (46 not out) managed respectable scores. Ian Bell was the key bowler for Warwickshre, claiming four for 12. (PTI)  Copyright

 BRIEFS
 Yaroslav Khoma has been banned for seven months after failing a dope test with excessive levels of testosterone, the Ukrainian soccer federation (USF) has announced.The USF disciplinary committee handed out the punishment to the 29-year-old international, who tested positive following a premier division game against Dynamo Kiev on May 17. The player, who has earned a single international cap, denied any wrongdoing, saying the substance might have been given to him by a doctor to treat a back their pool on Monday with a third straight win in the boys under-19 world volleyball championship being held in Suphanbari, Thailand.After beating Brazil on Sunday, the Indians drubbed Czech Republic 25-20, 25-17, 25-16 in just 65 minutes.While Dinesh and Rathish excelled in block, R. Kamaraj impressed with his thundering back court attacks, according to information received Yesaulenko has been charged by police with tax evasion following the sale of Russian international Dmitry Alenichev to Italian club Roma in 1998. Russian tax police said they had charged Yesaulenko, who served as Spartaks first vice-president from 1992 to 2000, with hiding $7 million in Swiss banks after selling the midfielder. Roma transferred Alenichev to Porto in 2000 where he won the Portuguese title and the Uefa Cup last season.Police said that former Spartak president and head coach Oleg Romantsev could face similar charges. Former national 13th in the 16-team premier division last season, have been relegated because of mounting financial problems. The Ukrainian soccer league decided to drop Olixandria to the very bottom of its professional ladder after they failed to secure the needed financial guarantees.Metalurg Zaporizhya have been reprieved and will remain in the top flight instead of Olixandria. Ukraines premier division Alexander Mostovoi says he is optimistic of signing a new deal with the Spanish first division club. The Russian international, who became a free agent at the end of last season, said the only stumbling block was the length of contract on offer. I want a two-year deal, while Celta offers me one plus one (year option), the playmaker said.I keep telling them its only one more year, only some $200,000 extra. Not much if they want to keep me. Asked if he would re-sign with Celta, the 34-year-old said: Yes, I think Cobreloa won the Chilean championship Sunday with a stormy 4-0 final victory over Colo Colo, who had three players sent off including Ivan Zamorano. The three dismissals in the second-leg tie all came after Colo Colo players surrounded the referee to protest against Cobreloas third goal, which they claimed was off-side.Sport on screen

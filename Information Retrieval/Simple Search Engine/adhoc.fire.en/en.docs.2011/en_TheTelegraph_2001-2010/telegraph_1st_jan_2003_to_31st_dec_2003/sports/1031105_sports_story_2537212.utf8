The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bahutule replaces bereaved Kumble 
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Kumble feels he will miss only one match Calcutta: Anil Kumble, who lost his father (K.N. Krishnaswamy) on Monday, is expected to be available for the last two league matches of the ongoing tri-series. Of course, he is out of Thursdays game in Cuttack and has been replaced by Sairaj Bahutule. I havent intimated the Board, but I should be available for the matches in Bangalore (versus Australia) and Hyderabad (against New Zealand), Kumble told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. The Cuttack game is versus New Zealand. According to Kumble, the countrys most successful spinner, his 68-year-old father fell ill during the Challenger in the second week of September and was hospitalised for the past three weeks. We are coping as best as we can and the family is thankful to all who have conveyed condolences in one form or the other, he added. Incidentally, Bahutule was in the Team India XIV during the recent two-Test series against New Zealand. Its not clear, though, whether he will make the XI or Kumbles berth will go to Murali Kartik.

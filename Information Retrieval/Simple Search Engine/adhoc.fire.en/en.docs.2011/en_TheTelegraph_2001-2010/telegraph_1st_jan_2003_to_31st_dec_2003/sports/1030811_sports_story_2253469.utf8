 Wright expects NZ to fight hard
Bangalore: The Indians will have to work hard against the underrated New Zealand side in the two-Test series later this year, coach John Wright warned on Sunday. The New Zealanders performed well on a recent tour to Sri Lanka. They are always underrated and they make you fight hard, Wright, a former New Zealand opener, said. Perhaps, the other side (India) is not different. Its up to us to perform better and keep the home record going. Asked how eager the Indians are to avenge the thrashing by New Zealand on its last tour, Wright said the team is always keen to play good cricket, against any side. On Jawagal Srinath, who is recuperating from a knee injury and is doubtful for the home series, Wright said he would speak to the pacer soon. He was hopeful that Srinath would carry on. I havent had a chat with Srinath for a month. But obviously we will have a talk in the next week or so. Srinath is big enough to take the decision. Let us hope he wants to carry on. But that will be his decision. Wright was satisfied with the performance of the fast bowlers in the recent past. We seem to be getting more depth in the pace department which is good. Wright said it was a good move to pick 36 players, including the India A squad that toured England, for the conditioning camp. He dismissed suggestions it would be too big a group to handle. It will be alright. I think it is a good move by the BCCI and selectors to get this many for selection. Wright said there were some good performances by the A team in England and congratulated its coach Sandeep Patil. It (36 probables) will be a good base from the fitness point of view. I will not find it difficult to handle as many. I am confident of doing a good job, Wright said.  (PTI)  Copyright

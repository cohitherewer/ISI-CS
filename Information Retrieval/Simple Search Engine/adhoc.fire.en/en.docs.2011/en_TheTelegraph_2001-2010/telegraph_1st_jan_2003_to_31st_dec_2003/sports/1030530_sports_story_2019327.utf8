The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No words for Chandras genius: Bedi
- Only I can confirm how much I learnt from Pras, Chandra and Venkat  both as a cricketer and as a person BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Calcutta: Collectively, Bishan Singh Bedi (266 wickets), Bhagwat Chandrasekhar (242), Erapalli Prasanna (189) and Srinivas Venkatraghavan (156) featured in 231 Tests, but just once  Edgbaston, 1967  did all four figure in the XI. The defeat there notwithstanding, that Test remains special for India.Thirty-six years on, the coming together of the legendary quartet, in the city, is reason enough for a nostalgic flashback. Incidentally, barring Venkat  who came late in the evening  the others had arrived by Thursday afternoon.The four, of course, are invitees of the Board of Control for Cricket in India for a brainstorming session ahead of the creation of a spinners wing at the National Cricket Academy.Its great to be back on one platform Sure, Im excited, Bedi, the most successful (colourful and controversial too) among the quartet, told The Telegraph soon after touching down in Calcutta.Getting a wee bit emotional, he added: Only I can confirm how much I learnt from Pras, Chandra and Venkat  both as a cricketer and as a person. Besides being such great bowlers, they topped as human beings Its sad, however, they havent got their due.Equally, because of the circumstances, its sad that Pras and Venkat could just play together in 15 Tests Their careers overlapped and... In Bedis opinion, while no words can adequately do justice to Chandras genius, Prasanna and Venkat would have been accorded demigod status had they been born in England or Australia.Invariably, Pras would script a plot and execute it brilliantly Very crafty and a big thinker, is how he saluted Prasanna, regarded by the Ian Chappells as among the greatest of spinners.[Bedi, by the way, feels Anil Kumbles contribution to Indian cricket has also been underplayed. Kumble has 349 wickets in Tests and 308 in ODIs, which cant be bad for someone often criticised for not being able to spin the ball much.Bottomline, though, is that you dont need to be a big spinner. Even a slight deviation, enough to take the edge or hit the timber, will suffice Kumble, who is a wonderful student of the game as well, definitely deserves much more recognition. Frankly, that he was played in only three World Cup 2003 games (all in the first round) is pathetic.]Its widely believed that no captain nursed the spinners as well as Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi but, in Bedis view, Venkat was one of the best captains he played under.Again, sadly, Venkat didnt get his due as captain Actually, I havent forgotten the disgraceful episode of his being replaced (by Sunil Gavaskar) while on the flight home from England, in 1979 The people who mattered, then, threw every single convention out of the window.Bedi, it may be recalled, was himself unceremoniously removed as captain (after the 1978-79 Revival Series in Pakistan).Asked whether he and the others would have been as effective in ODIs  collectively, they made a mere 26 appearances  Bedi was candid: Difficult to say However, Im glad we got to work on our skills in the longer version of the sport. My own belief (first conveyed through our World Cup magazine, in February) is that the U-17s and 15s ought to be kept away from limited overs cricket, which isnt the right grounding.For good measure, he added: In any case, in the sports shorter version, captains must get out of the containment-mentality. As Ive said, a wicket is a dot-ball and, so, the spinners should be encouraged to attack.Significantly, Bedi declined to comment on Sourav Gangulys handling of spinners.Acknowledging the role played by brilliant close-in fielders (chiefly Ajit Wadekar, Abid Ali, Eknath Solkar and Gundappa Viswanath) in their success, Bedi emphasised the need for team work. Asked whether the state of Indias spin industry was cause for despondency, he answered: No Indeed, this brainstorming session is a step in the right direction as we do need to review what has always been our strength. After all, its a fact that we lack the explosive energy of the Australians and South AfricansIn Bedis opinion, among the younger bowlers, Murali Kartik is most promising. And, yes, he is disappointed that the selectors have been ignoring Sunil Joshi.  Copyright

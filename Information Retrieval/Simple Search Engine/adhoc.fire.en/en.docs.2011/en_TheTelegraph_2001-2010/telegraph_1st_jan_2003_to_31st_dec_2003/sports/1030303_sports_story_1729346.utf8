The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latif still suffering from nausea
Johannesburg: Pakistan wicketkeeper-batsman Rashid Latif, who was hit on his helmet by a Zaheer Khan bouncer during the India-Pakistan World Cup game at Centurion, Sunday said he was still suffering from nausea. I am still suffering a bit of nausea. It was a hard blow on my head, Latif said. But the gutsy player did not seem to bear any ill-will towards Zaheer and was full of praise for the Indian pacer for the manner in which he bowled in the death overs, varying his pace and length and generally keeping the batsmen guessing.

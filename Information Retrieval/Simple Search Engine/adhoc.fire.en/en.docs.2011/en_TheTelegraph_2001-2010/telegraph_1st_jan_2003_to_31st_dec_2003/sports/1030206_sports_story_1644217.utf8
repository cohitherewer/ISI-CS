 Bhandari, Mukesh lead
 Pune: Vivek Bhandari and Mukesh Kumar got off to flying starts on the opening day of the Rs 10-lakh Hero Honda Open West golf meet on Wednesday. Mukesh and Bhandari shot rounds of four-under 67 each to enjoy a one-stroke lead over Amandeep Johl. Defending champion Feroz Ali, his younger brother Rafiq, and S. Madaiah were tied fourth at two-under 69 at the par-71 of the Poona Golf Club course. Bhandari started with bogies on the first and third holes, but settled down to make six birdies thereafter.

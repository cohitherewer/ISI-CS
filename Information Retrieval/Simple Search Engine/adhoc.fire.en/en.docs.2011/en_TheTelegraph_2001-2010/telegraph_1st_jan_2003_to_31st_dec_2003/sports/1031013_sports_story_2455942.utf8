Carson: Germany won the womens World Cup football title for the first time on Sunday after a golden goal from substitute Nia Kuenzer gave them a 2-1 victory over Sweden. The match had gone into extra time when Kuenzer rose to meet a free-kick from Renate Lingor in the 98th minute and headed home from 12 yards out. Sweden had taken the lead in the 41st minute when Hanna Ljungberg scored. Germany equalised 45 seconds into the second half through Maren Meinert.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

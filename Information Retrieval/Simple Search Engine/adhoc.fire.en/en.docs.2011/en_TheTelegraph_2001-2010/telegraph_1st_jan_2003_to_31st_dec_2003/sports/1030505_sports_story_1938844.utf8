 Gatting wants Hussain out
London: Former England skipper Mike Gatting believes self-centred Nasser Hussain should relinquish his Test captaincy too for the good in the long run. Writing for The Observer, Gatting said Hussain should remember that cricket was a team game and that personal ambitions were not good for the team. The England captain has always been pretty self-centred, but reading his Sunday newspaper column last week  I want to play this many Tests, I want to break this many records, I want more victories than anyone else, etc.. It would have been very easy to forget that cricket is a team game and the England captaincy is an honour, not a right, Gatting wrote.  (PTI)  Copyright

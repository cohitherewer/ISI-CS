 Fominyh on top with Ramesh
 - Surya half point off leaders New Delhi: Overnight leader R. B. Ramesh played a quick draw with top-seed GM Dmitry Svetushkin of Moldova while Russian GM Alexander Fominyh beat IM Verghese Koshy to move into joint lead at the end of the eighth round in the Parsvnath international chess meet here Tuesday. Ramesh and Fominyh, who recorded his fourth straight victory in the Rs 3 lakh prize money tournament Tuesday, now have seven points each and are leading a group of four  GM P. Harikrisha, Svetushkin, GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly and IM Neelotpal Das  by half-a-point. On top board, Ramesh opted for the Queens defence, popularised by former world champion Anatoly Karpov, and seemed to be in a better position in the middle game. But the double GM-norm holder played it safe against the dangerous Moldavian and agreed for a draw after 23 moves. Meanwhile, Fominyh continued with his good run to beat the experienced Koshy in 34 moves. Koshy, who had defeated GM Marat Dhzumaev of Uzbekistan and IM S. Kidambi Monday, played his preferred English opening but was forced to adopt a defensive game as he conceded the centre too early to his opponent. The Russian GM made good use of the position to nail Koshy in the rook and minor pieces endgame committing the Indian into a premature resignation.Youngest Commonwealth champion Harikrishna was not at his best against IM Neelotpal Das and agreed to a draw in 30 moves to maintain second spot. Asian womens champion Koneru Humpy had something to cheer about as she defeated Dushyant Das to reverse the trend of defeats. The Andhra girl had lost both her matches to lesser-known opponents Monday, virtually nullifying her title chances. IMPORTANT RESULTS (all Indian unless specified) D. Svetushkin (Mda) 6.5 drew R.B.

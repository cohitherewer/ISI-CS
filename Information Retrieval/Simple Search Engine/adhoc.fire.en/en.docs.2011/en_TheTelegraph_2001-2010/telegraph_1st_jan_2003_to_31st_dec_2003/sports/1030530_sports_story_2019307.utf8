 Australia cancel Morocco plans
Melbourne: Australia have cancelled plans to play in a one-day tournament in northern Africa scheduled for later this year, the ACB said on Thursday. The ACB released a statement following media reports that each player was prepared to forfeit up to A$30,000 (US$20,000) to pull out of the Morocco tournament being held in August and September. There were a number of issues to manage but in the end, it came down to a problem with dates, the ACBs general manager of cricket operations Michael Brown said. The ACB had also been monitoring the security situation in Morocco and assessing player workload, he added. The board held discussions with the Australian Cricketers Association and government officials before announcing the decision to cancel Australias participation in the International Cricket Council-sanctioned tournament. A full list of teams expected to participate in the Morocco event has yet to be announced. Australia return from their tour of the West Indies on June 4 and will host Bangladesh for two Tests and a one-day series in July and August. The players will take annual leave in September. Australia then host two tests against Zimbabwe in October before heading to India for a one-day triangular series that also includes New Zealand. India will tour Australia for four tests in December and January before they are joined by Zimbabwe for a triangular one-day series. Eyeing a perfect end Unburdened by the end of their 21-game winning streak, the Australians are looking to round off their Caribbean tour with wins in the last two one-day Internationals here this weekend, Reuters adds from St Georges, Grenada. The West Indies halted the Aussies all-conquering one- day run with a comprehensive 39-run victory in Port-of-Spain last Sunday. The Australians have already clinched the series with wins in the first four games, but are hell-bent on winning the last two matches after the unexpected loss.  (Reuters)  Copyright

				 																																	Melbourne: Australias Damien Fleming rated Lance Klusener as the most dangerous finisher in one-day cricket after watching his batting fireworks for South Africa in their World Cup opener against West Indies on Sunday.				 																																	Klusener blasted 57 in just 48 balls, including five sixes and a four, but was caught in the final over. South Africa lost by three runs.				 																																	Hes probably the hardest guy to bowl to at the death, Fleming said in a telephone interview from his Adelaide home on Monday. It was Fleming who bowled the final over to Klusener at Edgbaston in the 1999 World Cup semi-final which ended in a tie.				 																																	You traditionally bowl yorkers at the end of an innings and we always felt you could bowl six yorkers and only go for about six runs an over, added Fleming. But in that semi-final and in other games, it didnt matter if you bowled yorkers, he could still hit them very hard to the boundary. You had to come up with a different plan.				 																																	Although South Africa lost their World Cup opener on Sunday, Fleming expects them to contest the final with Australia. 				 																																	I would expect Ricky Pontings Aussies to play well straight away. They have so much talent in this squad. Thats the exciting thing about a World Cup. Australia could play well but, if Sachin Tendulkar or Shoaib Akhtar perform at their best on the day, they could knock off the Aussies. 				 																																	New Delhi: Hopes of Rajdhani commuters to hear live radio broadcasts of the World Cup commentaries may be shattered, with the Railways understood to have turned down an All India Radio (AIR) proposal saying it was not technically feasible. AIR had suggested putting up an antenna on Rajdhani trains so that the passengers could hear the commentaries live on radio while travelling. 				 																																	Prasar Bharati sources said a test run of live broadcast was conducted on the Thiruvananthapuram Rajdhani before the proposal was sent. However, sources in the Railway ministry said the AIRs proposal could not be accepted as technical experts did not find live broadcasts workable or technically feasible. They said if it was possible, the Railways would have begun airing the commentaries on Sunday when the first match was held. 				 																																	News bulletins recorded at night were aired on radio in the trains the following morning but live broadcasts was difficult, they said. The AIR proposed to air commentaries on 35 Rajdhanis and 28 Shatabdis. 				 																																	Pretoria: People visiting South Africa during the duration of the World Cup are in for a pleasant surprise as the hosts have decided to roll out the red carpet to ensure that the best image of the country is portrayed to the cricket fans worldwide.				 																																	A significant percentage of the visitors are cricket fans from India. The South African Tourism Board is promoting the country as the tourism destination of the decade and called upon its citizens not to do anything that would besmirch the image of the country.				 																																	The boards CEO, Cheryl Carolus, said in a statement that it had pulled out all the stops to take advantage of opportunities thrown up by the staging of the World Cup.				 																																	n Australia vs Pakistan, live from 1.30 pm on Max n Canada vs Bangladesh, live from 6 pm on Sony n Sri Lanka vs New Zealand, highlights from 10.30 pm on Max

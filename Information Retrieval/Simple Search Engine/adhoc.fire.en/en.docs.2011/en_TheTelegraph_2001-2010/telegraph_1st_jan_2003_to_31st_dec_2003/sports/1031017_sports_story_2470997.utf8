 Waugh backs quota comments
 Racist but true, says Steve Waugh Sydney: Australian skipper Steve Waugh on Thursday backed controversial comments by Murray Goodwin that Zimbabwes black players were getting a free ride into the countrys Test cricket team because of their colour. Goodwin, now with Western Australia, has been charged by his state association with a breach of Cricket Australias Code of Behaviour for making the comments. Punishment for players found to have breached the public comment rule range from a reprimand to a match ban or a fine of up to $4,000 for a first offence. It sounds really racist but in fact its the truth and thats a sad state of affairs because these guys dont have to perform as well as the European guys to get a game, Waugh said. Waugh, speaking to reporters ahead of Fridays second Test here with Zimbabwe, said while cricket threw up a myriad of talking points, the sensitivity of some of the games administrators and conduct codes left players in a Catch-22 situation. Waugh said players often censured themselves to avoid similar strife experienced by Goodwin. Even when youre out there if you do something not 100 per cent correct in the eyes of everyone, youre considered a rebel, he said. But then on the other side of that is they say theres no characters left in the game any more, so you cant win either way.  (AFP)  Copyright

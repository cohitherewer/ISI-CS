The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ghavri blasts batsmen
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Bengal coach Karsan Ghavri was disgusted with the performance of his batsmen after the opening day of the Ranji Trophy tie against Assam. The way they batted was absolutely criminal. The pitch did afford a bit of assistance to bowlers in the first session, but the way seniors like Devang Gandhi played is totally unacceptable, said the former India allrounder. He said that though no punishments can be inflicted on the players, they can easily be dropped if this sort of performance continues. The only thing is that we dont have too good a reserve bench. Yet, a reshuffle cant be ruled out.  Copyright

 Raul keeps Real on course

(AFP) London: Juventus virtually clinched their place in the Champions League quarter finals with a last-gasp win over Deportivo La Coruna on Wednesday, but holders Real Madrid must wait, despite an impressive victory over AC Milan. Croatian Igor Tudors dramatic goal in Turin three minutes into stoppage time gave Juventus a 3-2 victory over Deportivo that transformed the battle for second place in Group D. It eliminated Deportivo and all but sealed Juventus place in the last eight with one game remaining in the second phase, although surprise Swiss side Basel could theoretically pip Juventus after their 1-1 draw at group winners Manchester United. In Group C, Raul scored twice as Real Madrid beat Milan, who have already qualified, 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu, but they remain only one point clear of Borussia Dortmund after the Germans beat Lokomotiv Moscow 3-0. Defender Ciro Ferrara put Juventus ahead but Deportivo hit back twice through Diego Tristan and Dutch striker Roy Makaay to lead 2-1 early in the second half. Juventus David Trezeguet levelled the scores just past the hour mark before Tudors stunning 20-metre volley, deep in time added on, sent the Italians wild and the Spaniards tumbling out. Juventus have seven points with both Deportivo and Basel on four and, under Uefas complex criteria, an unlikely pair of results in next weeks final matches could still see the Swiss club qualify ahead of the Italians. Christian Gross side deserved their 1-1 draw at Old Trafford against United, who started the match with only two regular first-choice players  Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand. The Swiss deserved their 14th-minute goal, a well-taken strike by Argentine striker Christian Gimenez. United saved their unbeaten second-phase record eight minutes into the second half through a rare Gary Neville strike. The pick of Rauls two goals was a fine individual effort in the second half that took his overall Champions League tally to 41 and put Real 2-0 up. Rivaldo pulled one back for Milan but Guti wrapped up a win for Real that lifted their tally in Group C to eight points, one more than Dortmund.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

		 Thursday, September 18, 2003  Accuser upsets 
 BY STAR RACER Accuser(Shankar  up) being led-in by trainer Bharath Singh after their  Derby win Accuser (Shanker  up) winning the Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes from the  hot-favourite Aretino at the RCTC on Wednesday. Pictures  by Kishor RoychowdhuryCalcutta: Accuser, a rank outsider in the field of eight, walked away with the 2,000m Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes, the star attraction of the monsoon season and the main event in Wednesdays race card. S. Shanker partnered the Bharath Singh-trained three-year-old.				 										Later in the afternoon, another of Bharaths less fancied wards, Aiberni, also ridden by Shanker, landed the Star Of Italy Cup. Thus, the trainer was credited with a rich treble. Bharath had opened his days account with the victory of Frontier Flame, the winner of the Free Lancer Handicap.				 										Accuser, one of last winters top-rated colts, was ridden in a clever manner. Shanker had the Twist And Turn-Arisen colt settled behind the leaders  Imperial Pearl and Modesto  until the 600m marker, before breaking away from the field with a three-length lead which stood to his advantage in the stretch run. Although winning by a shade over a length, Accuser hardly seemed to be under pressure when the Vijay Singh hot-favourite Aretino came with a late run past the distance-post. 				 										Significantly, the Singh brothers wrapped up five of the seven events on the cards, leaving fellow trainers Deepak Karki and the leading professional Daniel David with a win apiece. Vijays winners were Arikara and Alexine.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

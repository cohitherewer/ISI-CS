The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Steve may be on notice
 Waughs great form is not enough to impress selectors Perth: Veteran Australian Test cricket captain Steve Waugh was tight-lipped Monday over a report that he was on notice to continue performing to be sure of retaining his place in the world champion side. Waugh, 38, has reportedly been told he is no certainty to be selected for the remaining five Tests this Australian summer. Australia clash with Zimbabwe in the second Test starting Sydney Friday before meeting India in four Tests. Waugh dead-batted questions about his immediate future after he led Australia to yet another emphatic win  victory by an innings and 175 runs over an outclassed Zimbabwe at the WACA ground. He was asked about discussions he is reported to have had with Australian chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns. I have quite a few conversations with Trevor, but the contents of those conversations Ill keep to myself, he said. Reports say Waugh has been told his exceptional form this year counts for little and he has to maintain high standards to be continue to be selected. Waugh, who has scored 812 runs in his past 10 Test matches at an average of over 90  with four centuries  has his sights set on leading Australia in India in a tour starting next September. He regards a series win in India as crucial unfinished business. Waugh continued his outstanding form in the Australian innings of the Zimbabwe Test, cracking a stylish 78. Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak endorsed Waughs continued selection. Streak said Waughs innings proved he was a fine leader and that he still had the respect of his players. His innings was another one of a leader and for Australia and the Australian team, I think hes still got a lot to go, he said.  (AFP)  Copyright

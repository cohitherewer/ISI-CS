They stand fourth in the group, after Tamil Nadu, Hyderabad and Karnataka. Assam hold on to their Elite Group place with six points while Rajasthan have been relegated with four points. Trailing by 300 runs in the first innings, Gujarat scored 384 for three at stumps. A. A. Christian (103), A. Sood (100 n.o.) and N.K. Patel (118) helped the visitors bat out the day.

 Pataudi: ICPA not involved
  CONTRACTS ISSUENew Delhi: Indian Cricket Players Association (ICPA) president Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi said Tuesday the newly formed body would not involve itself in the contract dispute facing the Indian cricketers.The issue is quite complicated as many parties are involved in it. Besides the players, the BCCI, ICC and sponsors are also there. So we would not like to involve ICPA in it, Pataudi said on the sidelines of a function organised by the Unicef for the polio-afflicted children here.Top Indian cricketers had objected to certain restrictive clauses on personal endorsements in the contracts formulated by the ICC and had agreed to take part in the Champions Trophy in Sri Lanka and the World Cup only after the apex body provided some concessions. The BCCI and ICC failed to resolve the contract dispute ahead of the World Cup and the matter is now pending in the Court of Arbitration for Sports in Switzerland.Pataudi said more than international cricketers, domestic players need the services of a body like the ICPA whose main objective was to protect their interests. He said the ICPA, which registered itself under the Societies Act recently, would be fully functional once it takes domestic players into its fold.All Indian players are our members. But we will start functioning after taking first class players into our fold. Though I cant say about a particular date, but we will start soon. Pataudi also said it would formally ask the board to recognise the ICPA in the larger interest of the players.Social dutiesMeanwhile, Pataudi, Virender Sehwag and Bishan Singh Bedi met a group of polio afflicted children at the Kotla Tuesday. Sehwag and the rest were roped in by Unicef and Rotary International for the meeting just before the start of play on Day V of the Ranji semi-final. (PTI)  Copyright

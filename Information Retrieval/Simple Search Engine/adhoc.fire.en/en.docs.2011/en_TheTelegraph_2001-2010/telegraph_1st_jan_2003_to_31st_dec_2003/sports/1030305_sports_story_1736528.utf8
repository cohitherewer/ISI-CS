The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak hopes doused
			Bulawayo: Pakistan was knocked out of the World Cup on Tuesday, its slender hopes of making it to the Super Sixes dashed by the rain-induced abandonment of its match with Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe made it to the Super Six stage from Group A after getting two points for the abandoned match to join Australia and India who have already qualified from the Group. Pakistans miserable run in the tournament thus came to an end. The Aussies are the only one of the trio to remain firmly on course after the Proteas also fell victim to rain and crashed out on Monday. The result also had its impact on Englands prospects. Nasser Hussain amp; Co. whose progress to the next stage hinged on a Pakistani victory, also prepare to wing back home. Zimbabwe, who benefitted from Englands decision not to travel to Harare and forfeit points instead, finished their league engagements with 14 points, two more than England, while Pakistan could muster only 10 points from six matches. Just 14 overs of play was possible in Tuesdays match which Pakistan needed to win by a huge margin to ensure their progress to the next round on a better run-rate than England. Pakistan, who elected to bat, were 73 for three when the third rain interruption sealed chances of any further play. The start of the match was delayed by 75 minutes and subsequent rain interruptions had curtailed the game to a 38-overs-a-side affair. But with no sign of weather clearing up, umpires Billy Bowden of New Zealand and Asoka de Silva of Sri Lanka were forced to announce the abandonment. The result also meant that Zimbabwe and Kenya, reached the Super Six while title contenders and main-host South Africa, were thrown out of the tournament in the first round itself.  (PTI)  Copyright

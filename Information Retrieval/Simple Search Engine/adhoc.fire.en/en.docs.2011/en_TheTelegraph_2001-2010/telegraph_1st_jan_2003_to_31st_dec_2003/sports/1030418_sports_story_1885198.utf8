The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dalmiya, Wright tete-a-tete in city
 - Specifics of extension, NCA on the  agenda BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI John Wright  Calcutta: Assuming that  the tri-series gets over on schedule, Sunday, Board of Control  for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya will  have a one-to-one with coach John Wright here Monday/Tuesday. Its significant, of course, that  their interaction will precede the April 26-27 working committee  meeting of the BCCI, in New Delhi. As already reported in these columns,  Wright is set to get a one-year extension, beginning March  24. Ditto for physio Andrew Leipus and physical trainer  Adrian le Roux. [The trios ad-hoc extension,  granted by Dalmiya late last month, is till May 24.] However, Wrights terms and conditions  remain to be discussed. As also the BCCIs desire that  he head for the Bangalore-located National Cricket Academy  (NCA) during Team Indias forthcoming lay-off. Clearly,  the NCA bit as also the terms and conditions issue will  dominate Monday/Tuesdays deliberations. Dalmiya, for his part, simply  said: Its largely going to be an administrative meeting  Significantly, speaking to The Telegraph Thursday  evening, he acknowledged Wright was yet to be sounded out   even informally  on overseeing the NCA activities as  well. While the BCCI  which, by the  way, was negotiating with the Dav Whatmores  is convinced  it will be in everybodys interest if the Team India coach  has a real close look at the brightest youngsters, Wright  could (with very good reasons) ask for a break. After all, save for the odd lay-off,  Wright has been working non-stop November 2000 onwards.  Indeed, if he wasnt such a pro, he would have been home  (in Christchurch) looking to matters after his fathers  death. Instead, Wright is today in Dhaka   actually, he just missed Indias first match (against  Bangladesh). If the much-delayed Asia Cup is  scrapped, following Pakistans withdrawal, Team India will  have a break till the home series versus New Zealand, in  early October. As of now, the Asia Cup is scheduled  for August 10-28 in Sri Lanka. Incidentally, Dalmiya may also  meet le Roux either before or after interacting with Wright.  Leipus, however, is still in South Africa. Copyright

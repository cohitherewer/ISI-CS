The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Buchanans radical ideas
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: In top gun John Buchanans opinion, the coach (or manager in the context of a business) needs to be a visionary. That was one of the points he made during an awe-encouraging talk on Managing Champion Teams, hosted by HSBC, Friday night. Besides being a visionary, the coach/manager should actually work towards becoming redundant. According to Buchanan, who has been with world champions Australia for a shade under four years, the coach will then end up acting as assistant coach. Quite a radical offering that but, then, Buchanan isnt the conventional sort. Not that he is too concerned with labels, something he emphasised during a chat with The Telegraph. Incidentally, the theme of Buchanans presentation was: How to be a Sachin in your own stadium. In seeking to get there, though, one should never be (fully) satisfied. The city, by the way, was Buchanans last stop on a tour which began in New Delhi and took him to Mumbai and Bangalore.  Copyright

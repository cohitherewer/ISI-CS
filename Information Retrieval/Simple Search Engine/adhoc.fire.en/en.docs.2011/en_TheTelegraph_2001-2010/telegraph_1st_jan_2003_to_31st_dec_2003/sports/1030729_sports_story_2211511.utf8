The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kanetkar crashes out on Day I
Birmingham: Indias No.1 singles player, Nikhil Kanetkar crashed out on the opening day of the world badminton championships, losing to former champion Peter Rasmussen of Denmark 4-15, 15-9, 5-15 in Britains national indoor arena on Monday. The day began with Chinas fifth seed Zhou Mi surviving a minor crisis. The 24-year-old had to save a game point before coming through a long drawn out first game against her former compatriot Yao Jie to reach the second round. Zhou won 13-11, 11-2, but only after slipping to 9-10 when she produced a tight net shot, inducing her opponent into a hurried flick lift which sailed just too long. In the mens singles, Xia Xuanze won 15-6, 15-7 against Indonesian Hendra Wijaya. The 14th seeded Japanese player Miko Tanaka was beaten 1-11, 11-2, 11-4 by Tracey Hallam, the Commonwealth Games silver medallist from England.  (AFP)  Copyright

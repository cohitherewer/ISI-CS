		 Wednesday, January 15, 2003 				 Hold your heads high: Sourav
				 	 New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming with the trophy in Hamilton Tuesday. (AFP)																								Hamilton: A badly mauled Indian side received some much-needed morale-boosting on Tuesday at the end of its nightmarish tour of New Zealand. While their skipper Sourav Ganguly exhorted them to hold their heads high, host captain Stephen Fleming admitting the Indians had more talent in them than the pitches allowed them to show. 																								Sourav spoke briefly, after India lost the seventh and last one-dayer by six wickets, telling his boys not to feel low despite the disappointing results on the tour.																								I know its not gone our way, but keep your heads high. We are a good side and I know well do well in the future, he said thanking his teammates for the hard work they have put in. 																								Fleming conceded that Indias poor performance had a lot to do with the pitches and said the team would definitely put up a better show in the World Cup.																								Addressing the beleaguered Indian captain directly, Fleming said, We know youve got more talent than what the pitches here allowed you to show and we know that you will be a real threat in the World Cup. We look forward to seeing you in the Super Sixes. 																								The Black Caps skipper was happy that his teams success had boosted the confidence of the players ahead of the World Cup.																								This was a real war of attrition. There were games that we had to win and we set about doing just that. 																								The series has been bowler-dominated and I know that we will go to South Africa with a lot of confidence, Fleming said.																								Fleming was satisfied with the quality of his bowling attack throughout the series, and also had a word of praise for the Indian bowlers.																								I know they (Indian bowlers) hunted in packs and they must have also gained a great deal of confidence. The batters have struggled on this tour. So you have one half of the side which is looking forward to the World Cup and the other half that has some work to do, Fleming said.																								Fleming, adjudged Man-of the Match, said: Its been a very difficult summer for our batting unit, full stop. We have our techniques scrutinised on wickets that have been very, very bowler-friendly and thats often been overlooked, which peeves us a bit.																								The surfaces need to be looked at a lot more closely. You start questioning your belief on the sort of poor surfaces we have experienced.																								I think its fair to say the wickets throughout the summer have been below par, its as simple as that.																								Weve beaten a very good side in tough conditions and theres no reason we cant play even better in better conditions. (PTI)

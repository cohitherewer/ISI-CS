The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tennis dropped
New Delhi: The inaugural Afro-Asian Games in India next month suffered a blow on Thursday when officials cancelled the tennis event because top players were not available. The main players from the two continents have expressed their inability to take part in the event due to prior commitments, said Anil Khanna, secretary-general of the ATF. None of the top Indians are available and other countries in Asia and Africa are not able to send their best team. (AFP)  Copyright

 Lanka not to renew Whatmore contract 
 Whatmore: To stay till May Colombo: Sri Lankas cricket chiefs decided not to renew national coach Dav Whatmores contract on Monday, saying they were looking for a replacement to inject fresh thinking into the team. Whatmore, a Sri Lankan-born Australian who guided the team to their 1996 World Cup victory, will remain as coach for the Sharjah Cup and the subsequent home series against New Zealand from April 25. Tennekoon said they were already looking for a new face to replace Whatmore, whose contract ends in May. Dav has been with the team for a long time and what we feel is that there should be fresh thinking, said Anura Tennekoon, chief executive of the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL). Dav has been a great servant of Sri Lanka cricket. He won the World Cup for us and this year reached the semi-finals, we have been very happy with his service to Sri Lankan cricket. Whatmore declined to comment on the announcement, saying he would issue a statement after the April 3-10 Sharjah Cup. Tennekoon also said the teams physiotherapist Alex Kontouri will also be replaced after Sharjah. The selectors were still unclear as to whether Sanath Jayasuriya would step down as captain after the Sharjah series. He wanted to resign the captaincy after the World Cup but was asked to remain by the sports ministry. Meanwhile, an out-of-form Mahela Jayawardene, who was dropped from the Sharjah squad, will be considered for Sri Lankas home series against New Zealand next month, Aravinda de Silva said. He will be in the side definitely. He is the best player we have got for the future. Honestly he is a better player than me, the newly-appointed selector said. (AFP)  Copyright

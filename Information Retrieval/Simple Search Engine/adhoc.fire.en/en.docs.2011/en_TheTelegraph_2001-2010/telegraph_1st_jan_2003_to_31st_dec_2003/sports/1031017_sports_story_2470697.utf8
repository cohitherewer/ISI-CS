The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Serena unsure of comeback time
 Serena Williams has resumed training New York: Serena Williams has resumed training following surgery on her left knee, but she is not certain whether she will return for next months WTA Tour Championship in her hometown of Los Angeles. Williams and her elder sister Venus, who struggled with an abdominal strain, have not played since Serena beat Venus in the Wimbledon final last July. And Serena would not say when she might make her comeback. I dont want to say right now, Williams told the New York Times. Im feeling really good. Im riding a bike. Im running and doing everything. But I dont want to get everyones hopes up. Williams pulled out of a tournament next week in Austria but is still entered in a WTA event starting October 27 in Philadelphia, what could be a tune-up for the WTA Championships. Williams has won five of the past six Grand Slam events she has played and until August was atop the world rankings. She said she did not realise how much she and her sister would be missed from the tour. It has been great to have the fans be so supportive, Serena said. I really wanted to play the Open. Williams dismissed the notion she might quit the sport altogether, saying: I love the game and plan to play for a long time. I really miss playing. Im doing as good as I can for right now, she said. Right now, everything is a day at a time.  (AFP)  Copyright

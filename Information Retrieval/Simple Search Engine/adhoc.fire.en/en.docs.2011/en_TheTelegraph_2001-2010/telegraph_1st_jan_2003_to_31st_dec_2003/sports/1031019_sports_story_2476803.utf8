 Ferrero, Federer to clash in semis 
Madrid, Oct. 18 (Reuters): World No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero will take on Switzerlands Roger Federer in the semi-finals of the Madrid Masters after the top two remaining seeds reached the last four in contrasting style on Friday. Ferrero brushed aside Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan 6-4, 6-2, a result that will be enough to keep him on top of the world rankings, ahead of Andy Roddick and Federer, for at least another week. Federer, seeded third in the 2.45 million euros indoor tournament, had to work harder to win against Feliciano Lopez 4-6, 7-6, 6-4. The Wimbledon champion looked to be heading out of the tournament when he went 0-40 down on his serve at 4-4 in the second but he held his nerve and went on to force a tie-break, taking it 7-3 when Lopez double-faulted on set-point. He then broke in the second game in the third set and that advantage proved enough to send him to victory in two hours 15 minutes. The other semi-final will feature Moroccos Younes El Aynaoui, after his 3-6, 7-6, 6-2 success against Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean, and Chiles Nicolas Massu, who beat Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina 6-7, 6-4, 6-4. Ferrero will have high hopes of making it through from the top half of the draw, after an easy win against Srichaphan.  Copyright

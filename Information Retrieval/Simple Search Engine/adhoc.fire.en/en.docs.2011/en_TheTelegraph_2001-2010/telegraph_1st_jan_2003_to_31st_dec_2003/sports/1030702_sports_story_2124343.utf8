The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PCB may pull up Latif
 Rashid Latif New Delhi: Rashid Latifs letter on fancy-fixing to the International Cricket Council (ICC) may lead the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to take disciplinary action against him. The PCB brass feels the Pakistan captain was trying to rake up a dead and buried issue. He has done something which is akin to clawing at an issue dead and buried, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said. He will take up the matter with PCB chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia and discuss whether any disciplinary action can be initiated against Latif. In a way, he has brought unwanted attention on Pakistan cricket, which we could have done without, Rameez said. In his letter, Latif said though the game was not currently threatened by match-fixing, betting was very much prevalent. He asked ICC to do away with the 15-over fielding restrictions in one-dayers as it was a primary source of betting. Rameez said action may be taken against Latif because he did not inform the PCB before writing the letter. As I see it, there are two issues involved. One is that a current international player has chosen to express his views on a matter he feels is affecting international cricket. The second is, he has not informed PCB before doing it and so we have to look at the disciplinary angle, Rameez added. I am personally not too familiar with the fixing of a cricket match, whether its match-fixing or fancy-fixing. I am also not too sure if plugging at the supposed loopholes is an answer to it, that is, if fancy fixing exists at all. (PTI)  Copyright

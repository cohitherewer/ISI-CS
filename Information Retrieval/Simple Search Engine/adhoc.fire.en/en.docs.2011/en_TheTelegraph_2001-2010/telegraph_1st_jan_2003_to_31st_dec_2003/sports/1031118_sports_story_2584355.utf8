				 																																	New Delhi: Indias dismal performance continued on the third day of the world weightlifting championships in Vancouver, when Nandini Devi and Sanamacha Chanu finished outside the medal bracket in the womens 53kg category.				 																																	Nandini lifted a total of 200kg (90 in snatch and 110 in clean and jerk) to finish sixth while Commonwealth Games gold medallist Chanu finished seventh, clearing 190kg in a field of 30 lifters, according to information received here on Monday. The gold went to Thailands Polsak Udomporn who finished with 222.5kg (110+122.5). 				 																																	Dublin: Irelands national soccer side escaped unhurt on Sunday after armed raiders fired shots inside the hotel where they were staying, police said. Two men wearing balaclavas burst into the team hotel in Portmarnock just outside Dublin and threatened staff with a firearm.				 																																	At least one or two shots were fired as the two men jumped over the counter and escaped with a very small amount of money, a police spokesman said.				 																																	The hotel said the team members were in their rooms at the time of the raid and there were no injuries.				 																																	Paris: World champion Valentino Rossi suffered an embarrassing snub on Sunday when Honda, with whom he won three world motorcycling MotoGP championships, refused him permission to practice with his new Yamaha employers.				 																																	Yamaha, who signed the Italian on a two-year deal after he wrapped up this years title, wanted their new superstar to take part in an official three-day Test at Sepang in Malaysia from November 28. However, Honda refused to grant their permission as their contract with Rossi does not expire until December 31.				 																																	Berlin: Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya will race for McLaren in the 2005 Formula One season after completing his contract with rival team Williams, Team McLaren said on Monday.				 																																	The opportunity to sign a talent like Juan Pablo was too good to miss and there is already a considerable amount of anticipation within our team about 2005, Ron Dennis, head of the Mercedes-powered team, said in a statement.				 																																	Montoya was a title contender this season, ending up third overall behind Ferraris six times champion Michael Schumacher and McLarens Kimi Raikkonen.				 																																	Wellington: Women in many parts of New Zealand became the targets of violence over the weekend as their partners took out their frustrations following the All Blacks rugby World Cup loss, womens refuge organisations said on Monday. 				 																																	In a country obsessed with a desire for the All Blacks to win, the demand for womens refuge services was higher than usual, the National Collective of Independent Womens Refuges said in a statement. 				 																																	Oporto (Portugal): Reigning champions Porto inaugurated their new stadium, built to stage five matches at the 2004 European Championship, with a 2-0 friendly victory over Spains Barcelona on Sunday.				 																																	n Cricket: England vs Sri Lanka, first ODI, live from 1.30 pm on TEN Sports n Cricket: Tri-series, India vs Australia final, live from 2.30 pm on DD Sports n Tennis: Masters Series, from 6.30 pm on STAR Sports

 Title for Mankad, Qureshi
New Delhi: It was an Indo-Pak winner all the way as Harsh Mankad and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi lifted the doubles title and also set up a summit clash in the singles at the $10,000 ITF Futures mens tennis tournament here on Friday. The top seeds bounced back from a first-set deficit to beat Asian Games bronze medallists and second seeds Vishal Uppal and Mustafa Ghouse 3-6, 6-1, 6-3 at the DLTA courts. The winners earned 16 ATP points while Ghouse and Uppal, who had lost in the final at Dehradun last week, had to be content 12 ATP points. Earlier in the day, Qureshi and Mankad had entered the singles final. The former waltzed his way past Russian Sergei Krotiouk 6-1, 6-2 in exactly an hour while Mankad had to toil once again for a 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 win over fifth seed Sunil Kumar Sipaeya. Qureshis family was watching from the stands. They wanted to be with me for Id, the 23-year old said. His mother Nosheen Ihtesham was Pakistans former number one womens player, and his grandfather Kwaja Iftikar Ahmad was a player of repute in the subcontinent in the pre-Independence days.

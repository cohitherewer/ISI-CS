 Tyson suffers $6 million knockout 
 Tyson Columbus (Ohio), Oct. 4 (AFP): Mike Tyson suffered a six million-dollar knockout here on Friday when the three-member Ohio Board of Tax Appeals rejected the bankrupt former world heavyweight boxing champions bid for a huge refund. Tyson made the claim in 2001, saying that he should not have to pay taxes from 1995 and 1996 because when he was released from prison in 1995 he moved his primary residence from a mansion in suburban Cleveland to a Las Vegas home. But the state used testimony from prior Tyson court cases in which the fighter proclaimed Ohio residency, including to probation officials after his departure from an Indiana prison after serving three years for rape. Tyson said that his claims of living in Ohio were simply a practical solution to prior inquiries. But the tax appeals court disagreed, also finding no evidence to suggest Tysons travels kept him out of Ohio enough to avoid taxes. Tyson had sought a refund of $5,895,509 plus interest for tax returns he paid in 1995 and 1996. Tyson declared bankruptcy two months ago. He has a 100 million-dollar lawsuit against former promoter Don King that was scheduled to be heard in a New York Federal District Court two weeks ago but was postponed to late April at the earliest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Im happy Steve will be home to watch kids grow
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Lynette feels Steve will be busy even after retirement Melbourne: Their courtship continued for eight years and the marriage has been flourishing for a dozen. Yet, if Lynette Waugh remained unhappy, it was over Steve spending limited time at home. Come January 7, though, and the outgoing First Lady of Australian cricket wont have cause to complain. Lynette, who was at the MCG with her children  Rosalyn (seven), Austin (four) and little Lillian (2)  on Thursday morning, during the Australians optional workout, briefly spoke to The Telegraph. Usually, this one-time school teacher doesnt give interviews. The following are excerpts On her thoughts as Steve enters the last ten days of his career In some ways, theres sadness... Having said that, Im happy he will be home and is going to watch the children grow... Actually, that hes going to retire is great for the family. Today, theres peace... Right now, my children and I just wish to take in every moment. On how she had visualised Steves career when they got married Back in 1991, Steve was a young player and the Allan Borders were the real stars... I knew he had a future, because he was so committed, but couldnt foresee that he will become an icon... Ive been proud of him. On whether it was romance at first sight (Laughs) We met on our last day at high school (1983)  he was in East Hill Boys, while I was across the road in East Hill Girls... Our relationship, therefore, began two decades ago. Its been a wonderful innings. On Steve having been away for long periods It wasnt easy... For much of the time, I ended up being a single parent. (Adds laughing) Initially, only I missed him but, in recent years, the children probably missed him more. On how Steve will be keeping himself busy after January 6 For one, theres going to be more time for the family. Secondly, hes keen to make documentaries and, then, will give time for charities. I expect the Steve Waugh Foundation to take up considerable time... Oh, he will be busy. On Steves biggest contribution to Australian cricket I dont know much about the game and, really, its best that others judge his cricket-specific contribution... However, Ill say he had a big hand in forming the players association and getting the families more involved with cricket. In effect, Steve made it easier on the families... On whether Austin will take to cricket Too early to say... On whether she intends making another visit to Calcutta and Udayan Why not? Finally, on whether deciding to retire was an easy decision for Steve to make Look, it cant ever be easy to give up something you love... Still, we realised there will be more benefits (for the family) by Steve quitting... We did have discussions and, eventually, my husband made the best decision he could.  Copyright

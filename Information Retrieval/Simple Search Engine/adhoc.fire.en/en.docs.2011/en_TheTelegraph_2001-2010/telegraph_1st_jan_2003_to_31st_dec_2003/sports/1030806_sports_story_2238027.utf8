 Gough quits Test cricket
 Ace paceman feels injuries have taken too much out of him London: Fast bowler Darren Gough finally gave up the fight against long-term knee problems on Tuesday as he retired from Test cricket. He, however, said he would still be available for one-day Internationals. The 32-year-old Yorkshireman had just returned to the Test side after a year out with a knee injury requiring three operations and struggled to regain his former pace in the first and second Tests against South Africa. Gough said: Ive come to a decision to retire from Test match cricket due to the injury sustained playing for England in New Zealand. Everyday is a hard one and my career is based on being a strike bowler and being the one the captain always turned to in time of need, but Ive found the last two matches hard going both mentally and physically  not just on playing days but also against the backdrop of the effort Ive put in over the last eight months to get back to this stage. He added in a statement published by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB): It has become apparent to me, no matter what my heart, head or public want me to do, that my knee will not allow me to play Test cricket. Obviously Im sad, but I think every player knows when its time to step down and I feel in order for me to concentrate on my dream of one-day cricket and possibly another World Cup for England and trying to help Yorkshire move forward, I feel I have to retire. Gough played 58 Tests, taking 229 wickets at 28.39 apiece, putting him eighth on the all-time England list. Gough thanked England for giving him one final chance in recalling him against South Africa. I hope they dont feel that, after 229 Test wickets and a body in bits, Ive let them down. I hope Ive served England well, he said. Gough has also played in 121 one-dayers, taking 188 wickets at 24.96.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

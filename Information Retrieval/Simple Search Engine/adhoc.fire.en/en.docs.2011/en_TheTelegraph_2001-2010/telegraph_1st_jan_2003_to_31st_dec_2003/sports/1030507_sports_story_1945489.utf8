The Telegraph - Calcutta
 World title for Mark Williams
 Mark Williams held off a brave challenge from Ken Doherty to win the Embassy world snooker final in Sheffield Monday. (AP) Sheffield: Welshman Mark Williams held off Irelands Ken Doherty to win his second world snooker title with an 18-16 victory on Monday. Williams, who saw his form dip after lifting the trophy three years ago, said he would not make the same mistake again. I went down a steep road and it took me a while to get back up the steep road, he said. I never practised as much and took things too easy because I was world No. 1 and world champion. But Im going to work even harder next year because Im determined to stay on the top of the hill. Williams held off a brave challenge from Doherty to win snookers premier tournament. Doherty fought back from 11-5 down to level at 12-12 going into the final session. But Williams held his nerve to secure victory and bank a cheque for 270,000 ($433,300). I knew he was going to come back at me, said Williams. At 11-8 it was like I was playing with a different arm and I was so glad to end the session at 12-12 because I bottled it when he was coming back. Williams admitted to a sense of relief at finally getting over the line. Towards the end it could have gone either way because Ken didnt do much wrong, added the 28-year-old. Its so hard out there and Im just over the moon. Doherty can take much credit for some battling performances throughout the championship. I could have been going home two weeks ago, he said. I had a really good run and its great to have come through some tough battles. As long as theres hope you never give up. I came back well and gave myself every chance. When I was coming back I thought I was going to do it, I really did. I gave it everything and its disappointing to be going home without the Cup. Williams won a frame at the start of the final session. But he failed to pot a straight forward red in the next frame and Doherty compiled a 92 break to level at 13-13. Williams regained the lead with a break of 87, but he allowed Doherty make it all square again after missing the yellow in the following frame. A break of 120 from Williams saw him go back in front at 15-14 and he then moved two frames clear when Doherty failed to capitalise on a missed red. Doherty revived his hopes by winning the 31st frame after Williams missed a blue and drew level again with a superb 112 break. The mounting pressure was apparent in frame 33, with a series of errors from both players before Williams came on top. Williams sealed victory in the following frame, following a foul from Doherty, with a break of 77.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

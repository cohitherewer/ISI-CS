The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Scoring crucial late goals biggest  gain
 - Dhanraj and Dhillon, who should start contributing as  game-makers, were quitr a let-down in the Asia Cup
 Stickwork / Gurbux Singh India captain Dhanraj  Pillay and teammates visit the injured Jugraj Singh  at a hospital in New Delhi on Tuesday, following their  win over Pakistan in the Asia Cup final. Each player  garlanded a tearful Jugraj with their medals and Pillay  presented him a replica of the trophy. (AFP) What a great relief it was to  see India break the Asia Cup jinx and crown themselves champions  in Kuala Lumpur! I must say they were worthy winners, the  way they kept improving with every outing. We lost 2-4 to  Pakistan in the league phase, then we were trailing against  South Korea in the semi-final before eking out a convincing  4-2 victory. Even in the final, Pakistans 2-1 advantage  was quickly neutralised and eventually wiped out. It was really heart-warming to  see the Indian team rally from deficits and disappointments  time and again, and ultimately rise to the occasion at crunch  hour. Far too many times in the last decade or so have our  boys squandered the initiative in the dying stages to lose  matches they should have won. In Kuala Lumpur, they reversed  that unhealthy trend by striking crucial late goals in both  the semis and final. That, for me, was the biggest gain  for Indian hockey from the Asia Cup. The turning point in the campaign  was the conquest of Korea. One has lost count of the number  of times the Koreans have overrun us in the last decade  and a half. Even in Kuala Lumpur the other day, India trailed  by a goal at the halfway stage despite dominating exchanges  and creating opportunities. Just when it seemed we were  headed for another defeat, the equaliser was struck. Then  came a flurry of goals in the final minutes which buried  the Koreans. Once this difficult hurdle was crossed, the  team went into the final believing that none could stop  them, not even the Pakistanis. It was Indias first victory over  Korea after the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games. But I must put  this achievement in perspective by pointing out that this  is the weakest Korean team I have seen in many, many years.  They did show traditional fighting qualities and were supremely  fit too, but the dominance they exerted over India and Pakistan  throughout the Nineties was clearly missing. The Koreans are actually going  through a rebuilding process. They prepared a young team  for the Asian Games and Olympics which Seoul hosted in the  second half of the 1980s. That set of players gave the country  yeoman service for well over a decade but their time is  up. A bunch of youngsters has replaced the old guard but  will take time to develop and mature into a world-class  unit. Coming back to the Indian performance  in Kuala Lumpur, there wasnt any particular individual  who stood out from the rest. In that context, the triumph  can be labelled as an efficient team effort. Goalkeeper Devesh Chauhan let  in three soft goals in the first clash against Pakistan  but then had two good outings in the semi-final and final.  Both full-backs  Dilip Tirkey and Kanwalpreet Singh  were  workmanlike without being outstanding. They have to cut  out their long, aimless hits and concentrate on supplying  meaningful passes to the midfielders. Kanwalpreet, in particular,  has this unwise habit of scooping the ball without any purpose.  He has to be told that scoops cant be used to ease the  pressure all the time. The half-backs played good hockey  in patches. Baljit Saini showed signs of recapturing his  old form, while Ignace Tirkey did a lot of overlapping and  scored goals too. I have no problems with a medio overlapping  from time to time and functioning as a forward, but left-half  Ignace was doing it too often and going into a dribbling  spree. This can lead to serious trouble, especially against  fast-moving European teams. The forwardline failed to combine  as a cohesive unit, till the final. The biggest letdown  in the tournament were the two seniors, Dhanraj Pillay and  Baljit Dhillon. As far as I am concerned, these two experienced  campaigners should play the role of game-makers, leaving  the job of running up front and scoring to Gagan Ajit Singh,  Deepak Thakur, Prabhjot Singh and Sandeep Michael. With  an important assignment like the Olympic qualifiers coming  up after the Azlan Shah tournament, Dhanraj and Dhillon  have to start contributing to the team cause soon. Did we miss Jugraj Singh? Yes,  of course, very much so  both in taking penalty corners  and defending them. The drag-flick is the most effective  way of converting penalty corners these days and, till the  time Jugraj is fit to be back on field, we must train someone  who can take this shot skilfully. Our stopping of penalty corners  was very weak as well. The lion-hearted Jugraj had learnt  to frustrate even the fearsome Sohail Abbas. Now, in his  absence, the coach has to earmark a guy and teach him Jugrajs  skills vis--vis blocking penalty corners. Despite the Asia Cup triumph,  Indian hockey still has some rough edges to iron out. The  last thing we want now is a fresh problem. The clash between  captain and coach, over Dhanrajs interaction with the media  before a press conference in Chennai, was most unfortunate,  to say the least. I quite agree with Rajinder that  players should focus only on their game, but blaming the  media for disturbing players is not right. I firmly believe  that in a team game like hockey or cricket, none should  be allowed to write columns or speak to TV channels just  before or during a tournament. In fact, a clear code of  dos and donts should be set up by the authorities and players  should be told to strictly follow it. But till the time such a code  is drawn up, Rajinder and Dhanraj must restrain themselves.  For the sake of team and country. Copyright

 Pay hike likely for Leipus, Le Roux
New Delhi, April 26 (PTI): The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is likely to increase the pay packets of team physio Andrew Leipus and trainer Adrian le Roux and provide them more secure terms of employment. Instead of the existing arrangement of payments on the basis of a weeks service, the two could be offered a yearly contract, confided a high-ranking official ahead of the Boards finance committee meeting here on Monday. Currently, Leipus is paid Australian $ 2,000 per week while le Roux gets $ 1,050 a week. They are likely to be offered a years contract by the committee which would naturally ensure a better pay packet for them, the official said. In return for the yearly offer, the Board will utilise the services of these two support staff at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) when they are not doing duty with the Indian team. Coach John Wright, too, will be offered another years contract by the finance committee though his yearly remuneration of $ 175,000 is unlikely to be hiked.  Copyright

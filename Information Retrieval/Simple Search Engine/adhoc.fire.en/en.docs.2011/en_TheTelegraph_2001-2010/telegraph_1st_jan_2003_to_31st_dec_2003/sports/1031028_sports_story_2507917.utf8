The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I give myself two years to turn pro: Advani
Bangalore: Newly crowned world amateur snooker champion Pankaj Advani intends to turn professional in two years. I have given myself two years to turn professional, the Bangalore boy told reporters Monday night, on his arrival to a rousing reception here from China via Mumbai. Advani, who won the world title on Saturday beating Saleh Mohammed of Pakistan 11-6, was cheered all the way by students of Jain College here, where he is studying in first year B.Com, and snooker enthusiasts. He was taken in motorcade from the airport to the Karnataka State Billiards Association, where he normally practises. The UK is the place to be in (for snooker). The level over there is different. Its that much harder. If I get wild-card entry to the pro-circuit, I will grab that. If I dont then I will definitely play Pro-Am tournaments, he said. Advani indicated that he was destined to win the world title and recalled how he fought back from the jaws of defeat in the first round of the knockout stage. Some force guided me. I think its destiny. I want to thank god for that, he said. I got tremendous moral support from my mother. And without my coach Arvind Savur I would not have been half as good, Advani said. He said the winning feeling hasnt sunk in as yet. (PTI)  Copyright

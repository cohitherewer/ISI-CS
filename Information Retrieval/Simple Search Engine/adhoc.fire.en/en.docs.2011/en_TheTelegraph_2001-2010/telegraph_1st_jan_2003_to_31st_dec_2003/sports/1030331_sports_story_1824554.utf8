 Agassi outplays Moya in final
 - miami masters l Serenas seventh straight win over Capriati  Andre Agassi in action at the Miami Masters final Sunday. He beat Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3. (AFP) Miami: Andre Agassi crushed Spaniard Carlos Moya 6-3, 6-3 in a one-sided final to land a record sixth Nasdaq-100 Open title on Sunday. The second-seed took only 71 minutes to brush aside Moya, the world number five, and win the $3.25 million hardcourt tournament, the biggest outside the four Grand Slams, for a third consecutive year. Moya was let down by his service game and landed only 48 percent of first serves while Agassi, the world number two, was ruthless in picking off the Spaniards second serve. Agassi, who has won 18 matches and three titles, including the Australian Open this year, sent back an array of fierce forehand and backhand winners. He came to the net to win 14 out of 15 points and kept his own serve consistent throughout, sending down eight aces to his opponents three. Agassi, who collected $500,000 for lifting the title, began the match at a furious pace, winning his first service game to love in less than a minute. He needed just one break in each set, setting up a first break point with a sharp forehand passing shot and moving to a 3-1 lead with an overarm smash. In the second set he broke for a 4-3 lead with a stunning backhand cross-court winner. He sealed victory when Moya sent a tame backhand into the net. Miami Masters l Serenas seventh straight win over Capriati Earlier, Agassi gave Spains Albert Costa a lesson in hardcourt tennis as he romped to a 6-2, 6-4 win in Saturdays semi-final. The American, who has dominated the tournament since 1990, picked off the ninth seeds serve with deadly accuracy in the second semi-final. Agassi, seeking a record third successive title here and sixth overall, moved through to the final against fifth seed Carlos Moya. Moya and Agassi have met twice before, with one victory each. Carlos will have a bit more firepower than Al, although with that said, there are always ways to get guys, Agassi said. With victory over Costa, the world No. 2 has now won 17 straight matches in Key Biscayne and has not lost here since a semi-final defeat to Gustavo Kuerten three years ago. Serena on song Top seed Serena Williams came back from a set down to beat Jennifer Capriati. It was the seventh straight win over Capriati for the world No. 1, who was attempting to celebrate her 27th birthday by finally winning a tournament in which she was runner-up to Serena last year and her sister Venus in 2001. Although Williams was not moving around the court as fluidly as usual she always seemed to have enough in reserve to deal with any threat from her fellow American. I wasnt on my game today but mentally I was up there. That really does have a lot to do with the match. I saw that she was getting a little tired in the third. I was just starting.

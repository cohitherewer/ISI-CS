 Imrans volte-face on Sourav 
Johannesburg: Merely a few days after slamming Sourav Ganguly, Pakistan legend Imran Khan did a volte-face and praised the Indian skipper for scoring a majestic ton. The former allrounder and Pakistans only World Cup winning captain was also profuse in his praise of the Indian team and master batsman Sachin Tendulkar and said India could now be a cause of worry to the other sides in the World Cup. Perhaps the best thing that could have happened for them was the return to form of Sachin Tendulkar. Sachin is a matchwinner and I think his 152 against Namibia underlined what a great player he is, said Imran. Im sure with Sachin on a high, the rest of the Indian batsmen will follow suit soon and join him in the free run-scoring. Imran said the return to form by skipper Ganguly also augured well for the Indian side. It was also good to see Sourav Ganguly sweep aside the recent problems he has personally experienced on and off the field, by scoring a majestic ton. It was a far cry from the performance against Australia, where he looked under-pressure and out of sorts.  (PTI)  Copyright

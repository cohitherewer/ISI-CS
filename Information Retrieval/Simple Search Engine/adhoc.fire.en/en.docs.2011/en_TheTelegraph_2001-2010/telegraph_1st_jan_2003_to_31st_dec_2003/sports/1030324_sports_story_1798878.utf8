The Telegraph - Calcutta
Bengal  Veterans applaud Indian effort
Mumbai: Former Test cricketers praised Indias performance in the World Cup despite the 125-run drubbing against Australia in the final in Johannesburg Sunday. Former captain Chandu Borde, speaking from Singapore, said Indias showing had been commendable and the players should be proud of their performance because they lost the final to a better team. I feel the team under Sourav Ganguly showed they are capable of performing to their best in big tournaments. Sadly, they could not repeat the form shown in earlier matches.  Borde praised Sourav for handling the team excellently after the group league defeat against Australia. The team had been written off by many, but all credit to Sourav for making them believe again that India could win the Cup. Former Test star Polly Umrigar also felt the Indian show was praiseworthy. They made it to the final after performing poorly in New Zealand and reaching the World Cup final is no mean achievement. They had a very bad day in the final but should be proud of their deeds before that. They lost to a better team, they must admit, said Umrigar. The seamers  Jawagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra  just could not get their line and length right when the Aussies batted and our batting too did not click. All in all it was a very good World Cup for the Indians and this experience will stand them in good stead in future, Umrigar felt. Another Test player of yesteryears, Bapu Nadkarni, said Indias performance in the tournament was more than satisfactory despite the final setback.  (PTI)  Copyright

 IOC to probe Young case
Lausanne: American sprinter Jerome Youngs clearance to compete in the Sydney Olympics despite failing a drugs test is to be investigated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), it said on Tuesday. A statement from the IOC said that sanctions could be taken after the disciplinary procedure but did not specify whether they would be against the athlete, the US Olympic Committee, which cleared him to take part in the 2000 Games, or both. In Tuesdays statement, the Olympic governing body said: The IOC has been working to find a way to move the issue forward and find the reasons for Jerome Youngs exoneration. The opening of a disciplinary procedure...is ordered in relation to all circumstances and facts relating to the entry and participation of the athlete in...Sydney 2000. The IOC move was immediately welcomed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), formed to crack down on doping in sport. This now leaves the door open for any necessary disciplinary action, said its president Dick Pound. Nobody from the IOC was available to speak, but the investigation is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Last week, though, at an IOC executive meeting in Lausanne, president Jacques Rogge said Youngs Sydney relay gold medal could be taken away. (Reuters)  Copyright

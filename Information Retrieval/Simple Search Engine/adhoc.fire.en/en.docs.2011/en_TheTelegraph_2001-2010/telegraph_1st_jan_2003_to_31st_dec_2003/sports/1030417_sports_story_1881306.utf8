 India A men 2nd
	 - ASIAN TEAM CHESS Jodhpur: China, expectedly swept the mens and womens titles in the Asian Team Chess tournament with crushing wins in the ninth round Wednesday. The Chinese men crushed Malaysia 4-0 to emerge 1.5 points clear of India A who clinched the silver with a 3.5-0.5 thrashing of Turkmenistan 3.5-0.5 in the final round. India C, who had done a star in earlier rounds, got the bronze with a 3-1 victory over Iran. In the womens section, the Chinese needed just 1.5 points for the title and they achieved it easily following tame draws with Turkmenistan. The silver went to Vietnam, following their win over Malaysia, while India A had to be satisfied with the bronze after a 1.5-1.5 draw with Kazakhstan. For India C men, it was a great achievement as they might not have got the chance to play, but for some confusion over the arrival of teams.

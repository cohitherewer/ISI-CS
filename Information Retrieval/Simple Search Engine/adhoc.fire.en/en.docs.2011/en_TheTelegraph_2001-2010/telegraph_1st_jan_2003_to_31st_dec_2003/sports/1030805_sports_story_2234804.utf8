 ODI win ratio Buchanans trump card
Cairns: John Buchanan has some impressive statistics to boost his bargaining power for an improved contract as Australian coach. Buchanan, in negotiations with Cricket Australia over a new contract, will point to the team winning more often since he took over from Geoff Marsh in 1999. Buchanan, asked what had changed in the national one-day team since he took over, said: Our win ratio has probably gone up as have other things like our run-rate. Australias win over Bangladesh here on Sunday marked the 100th one-day game since Buchanan took charge. Before he took over, Australia had played 443 one-day games for a success rate of 58 per cent. In his four years in charge, Australias success rate is up to 78 per cent. The teams run-rate has increased from 4.53 runs per over, or 227 runs per game, to 5.28, or 264 runs per game.

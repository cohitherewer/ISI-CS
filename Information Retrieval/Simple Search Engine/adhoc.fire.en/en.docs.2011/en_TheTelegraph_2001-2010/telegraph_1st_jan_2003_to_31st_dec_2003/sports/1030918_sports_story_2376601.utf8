Nedunchazian defeated the world No.14 Bozovic 6-4, 6-0 to give India a 1-0 lead but 14-year old Rupesh Roy could not do much against the junior world No.1 Novak Djokovic as he went down 4-6, 2-6 in the second singles on Tuesday.

Cairo: Egypt is betting on its historical heritage and tourist and sports infrastructure to win the competition to host the 2010 football World Cup finals, a minister said on Wednesday. Sports and youth minister Ali Eddin Helal said Egypt has more to offer for the football fans than the excitement of the tournament. Egypts historical heritage, the pyramids, the pharaohs and the museums, can make this World Cup very special, he said. Fifa has decided to hold the 2010 finals in Africa. Six nations have offered to host them: Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia. 				 																																	Manchester: Nicolas Anelka has urged his Manchester City teammates to build on their impressive start to the English Premier League. With leaders Arsenal travelling to second placed Manchester United on Sunday, City can go top if they beat Fulham by two goals on Saturday. The 24-year-old Anelka has called for a long-term effort. We have made a good start to the season and now we have to maintain it, Anelka said. We are in third place and that is something for us to fight for and hold onto if we can. 				 																																	Manchester: Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes does not need a hernia operation and could be fit for Englands Euro 2004 clash in Turkey next month. 				 																																	It had been feared Scholes might need a third hernia operation, which would have kept him out of action for at least a month  ruling him out of the Istanbul match on October 11.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Madan would have preferred Dahiya or Ratra
																								New Delhi: Expressing his disapproval at the selection of Parthiv Patel as the specialist wicketkeeper in the Indian World Cup squad, former national selector Madanlal said Monday that Vijay Dahiya or Ajay Ratra would have been a better choice.																								The selectors were left with no choice. Deep Dasgupta was the only other keeper among probables, and everyone knew he wouldnt get through. Dahiya would have been a better choice for one-dayers, he said .																								 Syed Kirmani agreed with Madanlal. No matter how great a cricketer one is, you need to be a wicketkeeper to understand the finer points, he said in an apparent allusion to Rahul Dravid keeping wickets. (PTI)

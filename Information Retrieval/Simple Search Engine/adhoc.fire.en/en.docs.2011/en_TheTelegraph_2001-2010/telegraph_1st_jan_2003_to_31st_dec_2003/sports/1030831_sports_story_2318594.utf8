 Pak demolish Bangla 
 - second test l Shoaibs first 10-wicket match haul; Maiden century by Hafeez  Shoaib Akhtar celebrates his 100th Test wicket, that of Bangladeshs Rajin Saleh, in Peshawar on Saturday. (AFP) Peshawar, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Pakistan, fired by Shoaib Akhtars first Test 10-wicket haul and a maiden century by Mohammad Hafeez, fought back to crush Bangladesh by nine wickets and take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series on Saturday. The home team came back from a 66-run first-innings deficit to skittle Bangladesh for 96 in the second innings on the fourth day of the second Test. Hafeez then scored 102 as Pakistan, set 163 to win on a docile pitch, reached their target in the 48th over. The 22-year-old opener, in his second Test, put on an opening stand of 140 with Taufeeq Umar (43). Man-of-the-Match Shoaib took four for 30 in the second innings to give him match figures of 10 for 80 as he passed the 100-wicket mark in his 27th Test. The Rawalpindi Express took two wickets in three balls on Saturday morning to trigger another Bangladesh collapse that saw them lose their last eight wickets for 53 runs. Resuming on 52 for four, they were bowled out within 76 minutes. It was their fourth lowest total and their lowest against Pakistan. Shoaib had put Bangladesh on the back foot by dismissing first-innings century-maker Javed Omar for a first-ball duck and Hannan Sarkar on Friday evening. He trapped overnight batsman Rajin Saleh, who failed to add to his overnight score of six, and Khaled Mashud lbw with swinging deliveries in his fourth over of the day. Saleh was Shoaibs 100th Test victim while Mashud completed a pair. Umar Gul cleaned up the tail as he ended with three for 16 in 4.5 overs. Bangladesh had reached 310 for two in the first innings before being dismissed for 361 but still managed to earn a first-innings lead for the first time in their 23rd Test. Bangladesh have lost 22 matches and drawn once. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore was dumbfounded by his teams capitulation. I am speechless and at a loss to describe the reversal in this match, Whatmore said on Saturday. I would say it is a mental thing with the team. They come so far and are unable to give the final push...we were in a position to win the match. Whatmore added: The wicket was a bit up and down today. But still, it is a big let-down given that we had won the toss and put up a big total. Bangladesh skipper Khaled Mahmud, however, was more optimistic. I am not disappointed nor do I think it is a mental thing with the players. I think everyone tried hard. But I think Shoaib Akhtar was the difference between the two sides.  Saqlain recalled Pakistan have recalled off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq in a 16-member squad for the third Test, chief selector Aamer Sohail said on Saturday.  Copyright

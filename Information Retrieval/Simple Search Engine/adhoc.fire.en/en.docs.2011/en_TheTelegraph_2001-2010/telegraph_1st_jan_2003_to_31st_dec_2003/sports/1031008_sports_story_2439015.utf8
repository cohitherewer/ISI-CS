The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United in sell-off rumour
London: One of Manchester Uniteds biggest shareholders have sold their 9.9 per cent stake in the club, it was announced on Tuesday, increasing speculation of a looming takeover bid for the English Premiership champions. British satellite broadcaster BSkyB, which bought the stake in 1998 during its own abortive attempt to take over the club, said it had unloaded the shares for about  62 million (88 million euros, $ 103 million). It did not identify the purchaser. The announcement comes less than a week after Manchester United, who are listed on the London Stock Exchange, revealed that US tycoon Malcolm Glazer had doubled his stake in the club to 5.9 per cent in less than a week. Last month, a series of media reports said another US businessman, Philip Anschutz, was poised to make a  500 million offer for the club.  (AFP)  Copyright

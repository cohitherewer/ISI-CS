The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, December 19, 2003  Chimango may win in Mysore 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 R. Byramji				 										Bangalore: Considering their eye-catching gallops, the three horses most likely to be involved at the finish for the 1,600m Saptharishi Cup here on Friday are Chimango and his two stable-mates Cesandri and Star Of Nature. With all three closely matched, it could be anybodys race. However, taking their weights into the account, the Rashid Byramji-ward Chimango, with M. Poirier in the saddle, appears to have the edge.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2.30 pm: Fires Dew 1. Secret Moment 2. Diamond Cut 3.				 										3 pm: Ponte Romano 1. Sky Hunter 2.

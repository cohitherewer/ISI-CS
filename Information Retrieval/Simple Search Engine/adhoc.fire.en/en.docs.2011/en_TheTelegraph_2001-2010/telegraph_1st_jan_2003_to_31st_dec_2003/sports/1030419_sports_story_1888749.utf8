 Ferrero, Spadea gallop to semis
 Spains Juan Carlos Ferrero in action against countrymate Alberto Martin in Monaco Friday. (AFP) Monte Carlo: Vince Spadea achieved a rare feat for an American at the Monte Carlo Masters when he humbled Italian qualifier Filippo Volandri in straight sets to ease into the semis Friday. The 28-year-old Spadea, who had slumped to 229th in the world in 2000 after an awful run of 17 successive first-round losses, outclassed his opponent 6-1, 6-3 to become the first American in 11 years to reach the last four. The semi-final looks sure to be far more tricky as he meets top seed Juan-Carlos Ferrero, who demolished another qualifier, fellow-Spaniard Alberto Martin. The defending champion won 6-0, 6-2 in 62 minutes  a remarkable score for a match between two Spaniards on clay. World No. 4 Carlos Moya also moved into the last four with a 7-6, 6-2 victory over Frances Julien Boutter. Guillermo Coria, who crushed fellow Argentine Juan-Ignacio Chela 6-1, 6-1, completed the semi-final line-up. Since Aaron Krickstein reached the final in 1992, no American has made it to the semis here. Mahesh-Max in final Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi advanced to within one match of back-to-back titles by reaching the final at the Monte Carlo meet Friday. The third seeds, who clinched the Estoril Open meet last week, beat Czechs Frantisek Cermak and Leos Friedl 6-3, 7-6 (15-13) in the first semi-final. (Reuters)  Copyright

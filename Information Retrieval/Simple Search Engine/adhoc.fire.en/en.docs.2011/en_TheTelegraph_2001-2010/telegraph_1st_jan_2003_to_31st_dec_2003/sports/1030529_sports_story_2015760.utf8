 Pakistan complain against Harper
Islamabad: The Pakistan cricket team has lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over a decision taken by Australian umpire Daryl Harper during its third match against hosts Sri Lanka in the recent one-day tri-series. The team management, in its post-match report submitted to Match Referee Gundappa Viswanath of India, complained that Harper had disallowed a legitimate four runs that should have been awarded to the Pakistan team, local daily The News said on Wednesday. The incident took place when Taufeeq Umar played a ball that was picked up by a fielder who tried to run out non-striker Muhammad Hafeez, but the ball deflected off the bat and raced down to the boundary for a four. Hafeez also tried to prompt Taufeeq into taking a run when the ball went for overthrows but the latter stopped him. Under ICC law, if the ball has not crossed the boundary line, it was up to the batsman to take runs off the overthrow or not, but once the ball crosses the boundary line, the umpire must signal for a four to be awarded to the on-strike batsman. But Harper did not signal for a four and instead was seen reprimanding Hafeez for attempting to take a run off the deflection. The Pakistan team managements complaint is that Harper ignored cricket laws by not awarding the runs to the batsman and the ICC should take note of the incident which, though minor in nature, is a clear example of an umpire knowingly violating cricket laws.

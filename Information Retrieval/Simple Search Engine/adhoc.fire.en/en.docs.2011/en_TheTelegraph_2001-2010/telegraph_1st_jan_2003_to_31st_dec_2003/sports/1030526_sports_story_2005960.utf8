- Gilchrist, Clarke help world champions make it 21 on the trot Australias Michael Clarke en route to his unbeaten 55 during the fourth one-dayer at the Queens Park Oval on Saturday. (AP) Port-of-Spain: World champions Australia steamed to a 67-run victory over the West Indies to clinch the ODI series 4-0 with three matches remaining at Queens Park Oval Saturday.The Australians registered their 21st consecutive ODI win which was also their 11th straight victory against the West Indies.Ricky Pontings team powered to 286 for five in 50 overs and bowled out the West Indies for 219 off 45.3 to underline the gulf in experience and performance between the two sides.The West Indies, pinned down by Australias pacemen early in the innings, were always well behind the asking rate and self-destructed with three suicidal run outs.Man-of-the-Match Adam Gilchrist top-scored for Australia with 84 and youngster Michael Clarke contributed a blazing 55 off 40 balls.Gilchrist, freshened up after sitting out last Wednesdays victory in St Lucia, hammered nine fours and a six in his 103-ball knock while the 22-year-old Clarke, who scored an unbeaten 75 in St Lucia, provided late fireworks with six boundaries and a six.Clarke rode his luck  he was bowled off a Corey Collymore no-ball and was reprieved on 47 by Ricardo Powell who dropped a dolly in the deep  to remain unbeaten in three ODI outings.Yet again the West Indian bowlers lacked penetration and were unable to dismiss the Australians for the fourth time.

In the four innings in the ODI series, the master batsman has yet to register a half-century.Gayle was trapped leg-before by a slower Harvey delivery, leaving the home side 174 for five with just over  Copyright

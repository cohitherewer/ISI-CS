 Karma overtook Steve: Greg Chappell
 Justin Langer was snubbed by Steve Waugh on Thursday as the skipper took the field before the centurion could leave Brisbane: Former Australia captain Greg Chappell said current skipper Steve Waugh had snubbed two of his teammates during the second day of the first Test against India on Friday. Chappell, speaking on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio, blamed Waugh for Damien Martyns run-out and also said the captain had walked out to bat too early after Justin Langers dismissal. Langer, who made 121, was being applauded as he left the field when the crowd suddenly switched their attention to Waugh, who is on the start of a series of farewells after announcing his plans to retire next month. He snubbed two players today and I think he would like to have that over again, Chappell said. Im sure it wasnt intentional, particularly the Justin Langer one. Justin had played a fantastic innings in difficult conditions, and had done himself and his team proud. And Steve stole the thunder from him by going out too early. Chappell said he thought Waugh had also been at fault in the run out of Martyn, who unselfishly sacrificed his wicket. Waugh departed two balls later in bizarre circumstances when he trod on his stumps. Chappell said he hoped the enormous interest in Waughs farewell would not become a distraction for the other players. Unfortunately, its going to be the Steve Waugh show, he said. The whole thing is going to be an event for this summer and it is going to detract and take away from other things that happen in the summer. Karma overtook him and he finished up getting out in rather unusual circumstances. He would hope that the summer doesnt continue along those lines. It has got off to a bad start and he needs to do something about it. He cant allow the event of Steve Waughs retirement to overtake the rest of the team and, at the moment, the first signs are bad. Australia coach John Buchanan told a news conference that the entire squad had spoken about issues surrounding Waughs retirement and vowed not to let it interfere with the teams objectives. We understand that there will be certain external pressures brought to bear on Stephen because of the last four Test matches, Buchanan said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

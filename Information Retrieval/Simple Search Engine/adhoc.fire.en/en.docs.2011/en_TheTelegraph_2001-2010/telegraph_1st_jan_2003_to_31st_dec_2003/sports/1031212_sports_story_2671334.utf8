The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India may start with ODIs
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Adelaide: Its possible that Team Indias tour of Pakistan, from end February next year, will begin with the ODIs and not the three Tests. In fact, instead of seven  as has been proposed by Pakistan  the ODIs could be pruned to five. According to The Telegraphs sources, the Indians are keen on starting that way as they will be ending the Australia tour (February 10) with the tri-series. Basically, staying switched-on will be easy. While the Indians havent played a Test in Pakistan since December 1989, the last set of ODIs there was in late 1997.  Copyright

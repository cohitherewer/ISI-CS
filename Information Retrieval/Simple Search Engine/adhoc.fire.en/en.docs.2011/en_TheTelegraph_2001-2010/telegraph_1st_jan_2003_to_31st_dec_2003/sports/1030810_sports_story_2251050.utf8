 3 new faces in England squad
London, Aug. 9 (Reuters): England called up three uncapped players in batsman Ed Smith, allrounder Glen Chapple and off-spinner Gareth Batty to a 13-man squad for the third Test against South Africa on Thursday. Batsman Anthony McGrath was dropped, while fast bowler Darren Gough retired from Tests after playing in the first two matches of the five-Test series. McGrath impressed with his attitude in the series win over Zimbabwe but struggled against the South Africans, averaging 17 in three innings. Kent batsman Smith has made six centuries this season and is averaging more than 60 in first-class matches. Worcestershires Batty, aged 25, has played two one-day Internationals, both against Australia last year. The 29-year-old Chapple, who is also a useful batsman for Lancashire, has never featured for England. There was no room for Surrey left-hander Graham Thorpe again. South Africa lead the series 1-0. They dominated the first drawn Test at Edgbaston before crushing England by an innings and 92 runs at Lords.The third Test begins on Thursday at Trent Bridge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Monday, September 15, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 The IFA is trying to be tough on errant players. Following incidents of on-field fisticuffs and players charging at referees in some Super Division matches featuring East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting, the state body called all the accused to meet its league sub-committee on Sunday evening.				 																																																	After lengthy depositions and viewing video tapes, the IFA has found two new guilty players and ruled that the Mohun Bagan duo of Rishi Kapoor and Sanjiv Maria is innocent. Tapes apparently suggested that Jose Ramirez Barreto of Mohun Bagan and East Bengals Mike Okoro tried to manhandle the referee at different points during the ill-tempered September 4 derby.				 																																																	All those accused, barring Barreto and Okoro who were not called to depose, apologised. The league sub-committee will meet these two on Tuesday. After that, the disciplinary committee will decide the future course of action.				 																																																	 The IFA wants to felicitate ASEAN Club Cup champions East Bengal in some style. So come Monday evening and the footballers will be sharing the stage with members of the 1962 Asian Games gold-winning Indian football team at a city hotel. Players of the 1970 Asian Games bronze-winning Indian team will also be present.				 																																																	To add another dimension to the show, cricket captain Sourav Ganguly has also been invited to be present along with BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya. 				 																																																	Also there will be local sportsmen from other disciplines like boxer Mohammed Ali Qamar, athletes Soma Biswas, Saraswati Saha, chess players Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Sandipan Chanda, Nisha Mohota and diver Mamoni Mondal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 2 athletes test positive for THG
Berlin, Nov. 22 (Reuters): Two athletes who competed at this years world championships in Paris tested positive for the designer steroid THG, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) said on Saturday. The ruling body ordered the Paris samples to be re-tested after the discovery of the previously undetectable substance. IAAF, whose council started a two-day meeting in Berlin on Saturday, said there were two positive A samples from the 402 further tests conducted. No names or nationalities were released. The relevant federations have been notified and will now request an explanation from the athletes and, if necessary, proceed to the analysis of B samples. The athletes have up to 21 days to request such a test, and the B test must be analysed within 28 days of that decision. A source close to the Berlin meeting said the positive tests concerned athletes who had either already been tested positive or belonged to a group linked with the BALCO lab. The US Anti-Doping agency said BALCO, a firm located south of San Francisco which has many top sportsmen and women among its clients, was probably the source of THG.  Copyright

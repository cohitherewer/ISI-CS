The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BHA champions involved in brawl 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, May 10: Calcutta Customs did an East Bengal, when the BHA League champions finished the competition on an unhappy note. East Bengal lost to Salgaocar after winning the National Football League. In their last match against CESC at Mohun Bagan ground, Customs not only lost 0-1, some of their players were involved in a scuffle that prompted the mounted police to intervene. It all started in the 68th minute when Customs player Ayaz Ahmed was shown yellow card by the umpire Arup Goswami. Ahmed snatched the card and threw it away. That incident resulted in rival players being engaged in fisticuffs, and the mounted police rushed in to control the situation. The BHA authorities said they are waiting for the umpires report, on the basis of which appropriate action will be taken. CESC won the match, courtesy an Anil Ekka strike in the 18th minute. CESC logged 28 points from 11 games while Customs finished the league on 30.  Copyright

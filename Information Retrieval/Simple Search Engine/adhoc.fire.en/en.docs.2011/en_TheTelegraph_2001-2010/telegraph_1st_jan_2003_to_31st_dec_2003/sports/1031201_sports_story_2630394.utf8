The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI action endorsed
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: Jagmohan Dalmiya clarified the BCCIs stand on the Abhijit Kale issue on Sunday, stressing there was no witch-hunting going on against the Maharashtra batsman. The BCCI president said the emergent working committee meeting, convened to discuss the bribery scandal, was kept abreast of all developments thus far on the issue. The working committee endorsed all the action taken so far. According to Dalmiya, the BCCI hasnt pronounced Kale guilty, his playing career has only been kept in abeyance till Bar Council of India chairman D.V. Subba Rao submits his report and the BCCI takes a decision. Had Kale not been suspended, he would have been eligible for India A selection in the ongoing series versus Sri Lanka A. But such an action would not have been appropriate, argued Dalmiya. He added the charges against Kale have been taken seriously as it came from two experienced selectors. He justified the inquiry as per rule 38 (7) of the BCCI.  Allegations rubbished Dalmiya also rubbished UP player Ritesh Yadavs allegation of a Rs 50,000 bribe demand. He said a year back he was approached by the players father who claimed his son was not getting fair treatment. A probe was ordered and nothing came out. In Kanpur, UP junior cricket team selectors Gopal Sharma and Shashikant Khandekar vehemently denied the charges. In Shimla, HPCA president Anurag Thakur threatened legal action against Jaswant Rai, who alleged that he was forced out of the team in lieu of money.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Marlon Samuels back in West Indies XV
 - ICC technical committee accedes to WICB request  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Samuels: May still miss opener vs South Africa Cape Town: In a dramatic development, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has requested the International Cricket Councils technical committee for the World Cup to accord permission for reinstating Marlon Samuels in the XV for the tournament. The ICCs technical committee has reinstated Marlon Samuels in the West Indies XV. This was announced late Friday. Samuels, it may be recalled, was withdrawn from the squad after a scan on his troublesome left knee revealed he would have problems lasting the World Cup. Simultaneously, Ryan Hinds was named his replacement. Now, however, the WICB has been informed that Samuels should be able to take on any workload and, so, the six-man committee was approached early Friday. Given that the West Indies opening match is on Sunday itself, against hosts South Africa, the committee will make its decision known late in the evening. But even if the green signal is given, its unlikely that the dashing Samuels will arrive in time for the opener. I dont have too many details but, assuming that permission is granted, I dont see him reaching Cape Town before the first game, manager Ricky Skerritt told The Telegraph. Samuels, who did the star-turn in the West Indies stunning victory in the Vijayawada one-dayer, has told newsmen back home that his fitness wouldnt have been a worry in the tournament. Whats intriguing is why both he and the WICB kept quiet all these days. Its obvious, of course, that Samuels presence will lift the West Indies chances.  Copyright

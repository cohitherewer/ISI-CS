The Telegraph - Calcutta
 IOC hit 283 vs CAB
Chennai: Indian Oil Corporation scored 283 for nine in the alloted 90 overs against Cricket Association Of Bengal (CAB), who were four without loss at draw of stumps in their pre-quarter final of the Sahara Buchi Babu invitation cricket tournament Monday. In other pre-quarter finals Hyderabad CA were sitting pretty, as they set a target of 240 runs for Air India after bowling them out for 134 while All-India Associate Banks gained a slender lead of 27 runs against Districts XI.

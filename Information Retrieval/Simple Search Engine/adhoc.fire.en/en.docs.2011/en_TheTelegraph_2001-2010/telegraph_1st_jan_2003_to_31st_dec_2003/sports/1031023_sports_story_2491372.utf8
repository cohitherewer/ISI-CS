 My best days are here again 
 Popat attributes her rejuvenation to new coach Prasad Ganguly Jaipur: There is some good news for Indian badminton as the countrys top women shuttler Aparna Popat, currently ranked 24th in the world, has returned buoyant and rejuvenated after working under her new coach Prasad Ganguly. The Commonwealth bronze medallist, who is here to play in the Indian Oil Asian Satellite Championship, said she was feeling to be in her best days once again. The new found feeling of enthusiasm, happiness and sharpness in my game is due to him (Ganguly). He has completely changed my style, my footwork and now I feel my best days are here again, the national champion said on Wednesday. Though he is most under-rated coach. He worked wonders with Pullela Gopichand and he is fantastic for me. He is innovative and unconventional, Aparna said praising her new coach, with whom she has been training at SAI for last two and half years. Moreover, he is caring and father figure to me and provides emotional support whenever it is needed, she added. Aparna was banned from participating in international tournaments for three months from March 13 to June 12, 2000, after she was tested positive for a banned drug during the Thomas and Uber Cup in New Delhi in February that year. Testing positive for drug was a traumatic experience but now I have fully recovered from that shock. I was ranked 23 in the world when that happened and now I am ranked 24th. I feel I have come full circle, Aparna said.  (PTI)  Copyright

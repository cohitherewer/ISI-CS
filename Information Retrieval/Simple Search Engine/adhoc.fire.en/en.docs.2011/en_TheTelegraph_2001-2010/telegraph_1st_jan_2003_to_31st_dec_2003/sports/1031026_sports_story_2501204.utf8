 Cocaine, Ecstasy in two footballers
London, Oct. 25 (Agencies): UK Sport, the body that carries out drugs tests for the English Football Association, has revealed that two players have tested positive for cocaine and Ecstasy. The duo was among a group of 272 players from the Premiership, Football League and Conference tested between July 1 and September 30. A UK Sport spokesman said: We dont publish names  thats down to each sports individual body. The FA refused to confirm the identities of the positive controls which comes on the back of Rio Ferdinands failure to show up for a drugs test resulting in his exclusion from Englands Euro 2004 qualifier against Turkey.

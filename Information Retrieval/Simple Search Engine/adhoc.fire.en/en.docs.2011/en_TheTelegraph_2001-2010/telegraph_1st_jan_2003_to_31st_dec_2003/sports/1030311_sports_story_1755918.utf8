The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I have been gagged: Olonga
Bloemfontein: Zimbabwe fast bowler Henry Olonga claimed today he had been banned from talking about his anti-Robert Mugabe protest on orders from the very top of the regime. I would love to talk to you guys but I am not allowed to, Olonga said at Goodyear Park here where Zimbabwe play their next Super Six match against Kenya on Wednesday. You can guess who has got the power to prevent me from speaking to you. Olonga hasnt played in Zimbabwes World Cup campaign since the opening group match against Namibia in Harare on February 10 although he has carried out 12th man duties. Trescothick wants break Meanwhile, a demoralised and frustrated England opener Marcus Trescothick says he has lost his enthusiasm for the game and needs a complete break after a forgettable World Cup campaign. To be honest, Ive had such a gut-full of playing cricket over the last five months that I just want to get it out of my system, Trescothick said in London Sunday. (agencies)  Copyright

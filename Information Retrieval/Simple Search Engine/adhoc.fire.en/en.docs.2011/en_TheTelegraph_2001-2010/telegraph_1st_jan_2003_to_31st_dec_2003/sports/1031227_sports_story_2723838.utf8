The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sehwags 195 among the best on foreign soil: Viswanath
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Kirmani feels Sehwag should have carried on Calcutta: His 114 in Melbourne against Australia in 1980-81 is still rated as one of the classics by an Indian against all opposition on foreign soil. But Gundappa Viswanath himself believes Virender Sehwags 195 against Australia in Melbourne on Friday as one of the best ever he has seen over 40 years. Talking to The Telegraph, the master batsman of yesteryears felt this innings should go a long way in ensuring a series win for the Indians Down Under. The way he batted was quite phenomenal. This should help us in clinching a historic series victory, Viswanath said. It was a lovely innings and we needed it badly. Really a special one Sehwag may not have been the purists delight on Friday, but Viswanath was in no mood to demean the effort. Thats Sehwag you should rate him by the number of runs he scored on the day. Viswanath however, didnt compare Sehwags knock to the one he played 22 years back. Its difficult to compare. I can only say Sehwags was out of the ordinary. But still, the Little Master felt Sehwag could well have carried on to score an even bigger one. He was so well set these are the little things he should learn as he goes on. Its the same point current chairman of selectors, Syed Kirmani harped on when asked to comment on Sehwags epic effort. He was toying with the bowlers, Sehwag should really have carried on, Kirmani said. Kirmani was also a member of the 80-81 team that clinched the Test to level the series. The way he was batting today, Matthew Haydens 380 could have come under some challenge. In fact, he should have gone past Hayden. Kirmani added. Another member of that team Sandeep Patil also praised Sehwag for his effort. I didnt get to see too much of the innings. But to score 195 against Australia in Australia in one day is really a stupendous effort. That speaks volumes of the boys temperament. Incidentally, Patil smashed a brilliant 174 in Adelaide in that series after being hit by a Len Pascoe bouncer on his face. Meanwhile, Viswanath doesnt want to read too much into Sachin Tendulkars lack of form in the ongoing series. It happens to every player. There is no reason why we should panic about it, Viswanath said. He felt its just a matter of time before the champion batsmen gets back among the runs. But Viswanath cautioned that India will have to play really well on Saturday to call the shots thereafter. The Sourav-Laxman partnership will be critical tomorrow, Vishy signed off.  Copyright

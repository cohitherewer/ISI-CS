The Telegraph - Calcutta
 One of the greats of Australian sport
 - Prime Minister Howard leads the nation in saluting a determined competitor Sydney: Prime Minister John Howard led the nation in saluting Steve Waugh after the Australian Test captain announced on Wednesday he will quit cricket after the home series versus India. The following are reactions from teammates, former teammates, coach, administrators and the PM:  DAVID BOON: I feel very sad. A player who has  been magnificent for Australia and truly deserves the word  greatness put beside his name, has retired from the game.  Its a very sad loss for Australian cricket and indeed world  cricket.  JOHN BUCHANAN: Hes left a significant imprint  not only on Australian cricket, I guess world cricket and  even Australian society. He is going to be revered as one  of the great leaders of Australian cricket and Australian  sport.  ADAM GILCHRIST: Im not saying players before  him didnt play with pride and value it, but hes the main  driver behind that passion and the aura of the baggy green  (cap).  JASON GILLESPIE: Hes a fantastic leader, he  leads by example and backs his players. You probably cant  ask for much more out of a captain.  KIM HUGHES: When you think of Steve Waugh,  you think of toughness, competitiveness, positiveness, never  giving up, of that Anzac spirit. I think hes taken cricket  to another level, hes not just a cricketer but a statesman.  IAN HEALY: It (Waughs announcement) did catch  me by surprise. He had been leading us all to believe that  hell be going to India (next year) and normally he has  the tenacity to follow those predictions out. While I say  it was surprising, I certainly accept it and support the  decision. He is a guy who thrives when the battle is at  its hardest, and tremendously loyal. He was at the crease  for the right reasons and loved it when the action was at  its hottest. He was one of five or six senior players to  put their reputations on the line to stand up to the Australian  board in 1997.  JOHN HOWARD: Hes been a wonderful captain,  a wonderful batsman, a gritty, determined competitor. His  colleagues and opponents respect his great determination  and tenacity, and I think hes made a wonderful contribution  I salute him and I know all cricket lovers feel the same.  Its a momentous day for Australian cricket.  JAMES SUTHERLAND: Steve has been an ornament  to the game and Australian cricket is certainly better for  the outstanding contribution he has made to it for more  than 18 years.  I know Australian fans will be grateful for the opportunity to personally bid him farewell as he plays around Australia this summer. His courage, leadership and ability to perform at a high level under extreme pressure will ensure that he will be remembered as one of Australias greatest cricketers.  MARK TAYLOR: There are tough moments as a player.  I think Steve Waugh is one of those players whos had very  few of those though. Hes had a great career, hes been  a wonderful performer for Australia, and I think hell look  back on those moments rather than the bad ones.  MARK WAUGH: I knew about eight oclock this  morning when Stephen rang me, when I was in bed actually.  He said Im retiring from cricket and no one else knows  yet apart from (wife) Lynette. I was fairly certain he  would go to India and retire after that series.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

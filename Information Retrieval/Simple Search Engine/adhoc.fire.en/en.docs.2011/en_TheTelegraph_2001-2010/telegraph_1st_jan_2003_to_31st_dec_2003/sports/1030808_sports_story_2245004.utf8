				 																																	New Delhi: Indian lifters clinched four gold and six silver medals at the on-going fifth Asian youth weightlifting meet in Bali.				 																																	According to an Indian Weightlifting Federation press release on Thursday, Sunil Naik grabbed two gold medals  for snatch and overall  and settled for a silver in jerk in the 62kg boys category.				 																																	In the girls section, Supriya Patil won golds in jerk and overall, and silver in snatch in the 44kg category. In the boys 56kg, Dhirendra Farswan won three silvers (snatch, jerk and overall), while M. Shivarani took silver in jerk in the girls 48kg.				 																																	Munich: Dutch striker Roy Makaay completed his first training session at Bayern Munich on Thursday although the German champions were still awaiting written confirmation of their record deal with Deportivo La Coruna.				 																																	The transfer is sealed, said a notice on Bayerns website.				 																																	Well, not quite sealed, but almost, contradicted a Bayern spokeswoman. Were still waiting for written confirmation from Deportivo. A fax could come any minute now, but could equally come tomorrow.				 																																	Deportivo simply had to finalise a few details, although the fact that they have not signed the transfer agreement meant Makaay was not yet eligible to play for the Bavarian club.				 																																	New Delhi: Australian speedster Brett Lee will be the brand ambassador of Timex Billenium watches, and will make select appearances in India in the coming months.				 																																	Lee, who made his Test debut against India in 1999-2000 in Australia, will endorse the watches both in India and Australia.				 																																	The agreement, initially for a period of one year, will see Lee visit India in September, a media release from the company said on Thursday.				 																																	Lisbon: Manchester United started life without Argentine playmaker Juan Sebastian Veron with a 1-3 humbling at the hands of Portuguese giants Sporting Lisbon to celebrate the opening of the stadium that will feature at next years Euro 2004 finals.				 																																	Two goals from Portuguese veteran Joao Pinto  both in the second-half  and a first-half goal by Luis Felipe were enough to see off a lifeless United side that relied on a late own goal by Hugo as a consolation.				 																																	College Park (Maryland): Michael Phelps, who set five world swimming records at last months world championships, just missed adding another on Wednesday while winning two titles at the United States Championships. 				 																																	Showing world-class form in events outside his specialities, Phelps won the 100m freestyle in 49.19 seconds and the 200m backstroke in 1:56.10, fading in the final 30m after spending most of the race on world-record pace.				 																																	Phelps missed compatriot Aaron Piersols 200m backstroke world record of 1:55.15 set last year, settling for the fifth-fastest time ever. 				 																																	Wellington: Jonah Lomu will make his return to rugby on Saturday after battling back from a flare-up of his career-threatening kidney illness. Lomu will start on the left wing in Wellingtons National Provincial Championship (NPC) dress-rehearsal, against Taranaki on Saturday. 				 																																	Lomu faces a race against time to stand a chance of being included in New Zealands World Cup squad. 				 																																	London: Former England pace bowler Ed Giddins may have to return to selling Christmas trees again after announcing his retirement from first class cricket on Wednesday.  The 32-year-old, capped four times, took the  decision to quit after failing to fully recover from shoulder  and knee injuries and told his County side Hampshire  for  whom he had played just thrice this season  that he could  not attain the level of fitness required.

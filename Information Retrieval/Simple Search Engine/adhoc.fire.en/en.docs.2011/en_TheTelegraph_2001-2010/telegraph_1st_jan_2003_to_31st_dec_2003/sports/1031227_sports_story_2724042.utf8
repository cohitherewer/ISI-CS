				 																																	Madrid: France midfielder Zinedine Zidane has said he will end his playing days at his Spanish club Real Madrid and is also considering when to quit the national side.

Its unlikely that Ill play for another team and carry on for more years, Zidane said in an interview with the Spanish sports daily Marca.				 																																	Last month Zidane, 31, told Frances Onze magazine he was not certain if he would retire when his Real Madrid contract ended in 2005. Im also thinking about when Im going to retire from the French team, Zidane added. Well see what happens in Euro 2004. Ill take a decision after that competition.

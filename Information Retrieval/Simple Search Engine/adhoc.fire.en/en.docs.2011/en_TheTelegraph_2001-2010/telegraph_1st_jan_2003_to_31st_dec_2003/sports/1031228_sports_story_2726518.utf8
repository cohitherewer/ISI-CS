The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dempo down EB to stay atop
 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Holders squander 2-0 lead; Okoro show-caused  The Goan side is in awe of Jose Barreto Margao, Dec. 27 (PTI): Things are just not going East Bengals way. They surrendered a two-goal lead on Saturday to down 2-3 against Dempo in Margao on Saturday. Nacimento DSilva sealed East Bengals fate after Stanley Colaco and Sunday Seah neutralised East Bengals lead in the first session. Earlier, the red-and-gold brigade was put into the lead by Bhaichung Bhutia and Cristiano Junior. Dempo have 16 points from six games while East Bengal stay on eight from six. The Goa side was reduced to ten men when Balaji was sent off in the 72nd minute, but that could not deter them from clinching full points. Luck did not run in East Bengals favour with the woodwork denying Bhutia and Debjit Ghosh on two occasions. Also Dempo keeper Abhijit Mondal gave a very good account of himself. East Bengal took the lead in the first minute when Bijen Singhs floater found an unmarked Junior and the Brazilian made no mistake making it 1-0. In the eighth minute, it was 2-0 when Bhutia pounced on a loose ball following a Bijen flag-kick. Dempo came back strongly in the next minute with Colaco heading home a Clifford Miranda flag-kick. The Goa side made it 2-2 in the 25th minute when R.C. Prakashs measured cross found Seah whose powerful side volley crashed into the net. Both sides pressed for the winner, but Dempo had the last laugh when DSilva headed in a Prakash cross. The referee showed yellow cards to Dempos Valerian Rebello, Miranda and East Bengals Mahesh Gawli, Junior and Bhutia. East Bengal striker Mike Okoro is in trouble. The club is thoroughly disappointed by the fact that the Nigerian didnt even bother to inform the team about his availability before the Dempo match. He has been issued a show-cause letter which could not be handed over to him personally since he had checked out of the team hotel in Margao without even informing officials. In Chennai, Indian Bank went down 0-2 to Mahindra United. Venkatesh and Abhishek Yadav were the scorers.  Bagan take on Sporting A depleted Haywards Sporting Club take on three-time champions Mohun Bagan in a sixth-round NFL match at the Nehru Stadium tomorrow. Haywards, who occupy the seventh place with a tally of seven points, have been hard hit by injuries to Jose Pereira, Ajay Diwadkar, Venancio Gonsalves and Abdul Latif Seriki. The performance of Gonsalves and Seriki, in particular, have been quite impressive this season. Despite the absence of key players, Haywards will continue to play an attacking game. We are aware of our opponents strength, but I am confident my boys will give their best and win tomorrow, assistant coach Peter Valles said. Jotin Singh will assist Dudu Omagbemi in the absence of Seriki up front. We have a good attack which is our key but hopefully our midfield, which looked sluggish in the last two matches, will play to its potential to neutralise the rival attack where (Jose Ramirez) Barreto and Rennedy Singh are outstanding, he added. Mohun Bagan look a solid side on paper and their results so far reflect that. They have come to Goa after a couple of important victories at home  3-0 over Tollygunge Agragami and 2-0 against Vasco. A tally of 10 points from five games place them in second spot, behind Dempo. Barreto, along with Edu and Leonardo, are capable of giving Haywards a run for their money even at their backyard.

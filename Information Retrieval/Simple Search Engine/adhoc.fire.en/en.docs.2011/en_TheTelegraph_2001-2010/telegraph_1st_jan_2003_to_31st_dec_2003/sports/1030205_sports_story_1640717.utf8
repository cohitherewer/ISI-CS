The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Muthiah stands by Jadeja ban
 Calcutta: Former BCCI president A.C. Muthiah justified the five-year ban on Ajay Jadeja for his alleged involvement in match-fixing Tuesday. At that time we went through proper procedure and took action. We think the action taken was fair, Muthiah, a member of the disciplinary committee which slapped the ban on Jadeja, said. He said it was now for the BCCI to look into the legality of the order of the arbitrator who lifted the ban on Jadeja. Muthiah, the FICCI president, was here for the organisations executive committee meeting. I am sure the BCCI will make proper consultation and take proper action. I hope whatever is done now is in a proper frame of mind and in a proper manner without any favouritism. On the contracts controversy, Muthiah said: I dont want to comment on that as I am not a member of the board now. But he maintained that the BCCI had not signed the contract with the controversial claws during his tenure.I only signed that India would send its best team for ICC tournaments, he said.

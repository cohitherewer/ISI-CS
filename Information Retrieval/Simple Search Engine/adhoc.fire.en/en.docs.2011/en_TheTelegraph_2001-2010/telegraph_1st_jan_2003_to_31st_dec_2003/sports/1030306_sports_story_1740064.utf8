The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak players apologise to fans
Cape Town: In an apparent move to escape public wrath back home, the Pakistani cricketers have apologised to their fans, saying they were ashamed and heart-broken to have let the nation down. We express our apologies and would like to share the grief with every single follower of the game, said the players in an extraordinary statement. We are ashamed, disappointed, sad and heart-broken after letting the nation down, the statement said. Pakistan, who have reached the semis of all but two World Cups, failed to qualify for the Super Six stage. They suffered defeats to Australia and England before an emphatic loss to India. We knew we failed to live to expectations. We tried our level best, we trained extremely hard but things didnt work the way we would have liked to and we have no excuses to offer. The expectations were there because we had world class cricketers. But unfortunately, none of us displayed the talent god has blessed us with. The anger of the fans is justified because they are the ones who made us the heroes and have every right to criticise us for our failures. The sun will rise again and inshallah Pakistan will bounce back and cricket would continue to flourish. Akram confirmation Meanwhile, Wasim Akram confirmed he will hang his boots once he returns home, saying the time had come for him to take a bow. Ive made up my mind but would make a final announcement after reaching home. (PTI)  Copyright

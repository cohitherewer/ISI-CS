 Anwar reverses decision to retire
 Islamabad: Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar has reversed his decision to retire from international cricket saying that he was acting on the advise of family and friends. In a statement on Thursday, Anwar said: I have consulted my family, friends and religious scholars and on their advice have decided to continue my international cricket. I have conveyed my decision to the cricket board. Anwar, who managed to shrug off his poor form and scored a century in the World Cup match against India, earned a great deal of respect with his performances from PCB and fans at home. Earlier, Anwar had announced his retirement from all forms of cricket after Pakistans disastrous World Cup campaign. Now, he is expected to be selected for the tri-nation one-day series in Sharjah starting April 1, featuring Sri Lanka and South Africa as the other two teams.  (PTI)  Copyright

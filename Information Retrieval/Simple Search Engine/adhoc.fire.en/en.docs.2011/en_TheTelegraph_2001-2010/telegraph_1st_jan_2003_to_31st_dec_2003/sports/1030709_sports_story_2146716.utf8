 Court summons Shoaib Akhtar
 Shoaib Akhtar, playing for Durham, in action during his teams National League clash against Scotland in Edinburgh Monday. (AP) Karachi: A civil court in Lahore has summoned Shoaib Akhtar to respond to a petition alleging statements he made about fellow cricketers, officials said Tuesday. Shoaib has been summoned to appear on July 27 after a private citizen moved the petition, they said. The 27-year-old, known as the Rawalpindi Express for his extraordinary pace and famous for his verbal outbursts, told Guardian: Imagine if I was playing for Australia with Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie softening them up, then come on, Id have got more wickets than anyone ever, mate. He went on: Because when I play for Pakistan, with Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis they are in decline. They were great but theyre not match-winning bowlers any more. So I have to make it all happen on my own. The petitioner said Shoaibs remarks were an affront to Pakistani pride and that he should be punished. The paceman is unlikely to appear at the first hearing as he is currently playing for Durham in England. He was told to mind his off and on-field behaviour by PCB chief Tauqir Zia before Pakistans tour of Sri Lanka two months ago. Despite that, Shoaib was suspended for two matches on charges of ball-tampering during a tri-series in Sri Lanka. PCB reprimands Latif PCB has reprimanded captain Rashid Latif for going public with a letter to the ICC saying bookmakers were still trying to influence matches. Chief executive Rameez Raja said on Tuesday that Latif had violated board regulations governing players under contract by going public. Rashid had written to us and apologised for going public with his letter and has promised to abide by his contractual obligations in future, Rameez said. He added that the PCB was satisfied that Latif had not named any specific team or player and had only expressed his personal view. Latif, 34, submitted evidence to a Pakistan judicial inquiry into match-fixing. As a result of the inquiry, former captain Salim Malik was banned for life in 2000.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

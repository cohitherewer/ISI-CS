The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kramnik in lead, draw for Kasparov 
Linares: After suffering a shock defeat in the previous game, worlds highest rated Garri Kasparov failed to make the most of a winning position to settle for a draw against GM Peter Leko of Hungary in the 20th Linares Super Grandmasters meet. After getting his first of two byes in the meet, World Cup champion Viswanathan Anand of India will be back in action in the fourth round with white pieces against Braingames champion Vladimir Kramnik, who played out an eventful draw against Spaniard Francisco Vallejo Pons. The other game of the day between Azerbaijani sensation Teimour Radjabov and world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine was a dull draw lasting 11 moves. Kramnik, on two points from three games, shot in to the sole lead after the draw while Anand and Leko are close behind on 1.5 points from two games apiece. Radjabov holds the fourth position having scored fifty per cent like Vallejo, while Kasparov finds himself much down the leader board with just one point from his 3 games played so far.

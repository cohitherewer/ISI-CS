The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain aims at three targets
 Hussain thinks ODI side is better off without him London: England captain Nasser Hussain has said he wants to play 100 Tests, become his countrys longest serving skipper and lead the team to more Test victories than anyone else before he retires. As for the first goal, I have played 81 Tests so far, Hussain, 35, wrote in the Sunday Telegraph. This summer we have two against Zimbabwe, then five against South Africa... This winter we may have as many as nine Tests; three in Sri Lanka, two in Bangladesh, four in the West Indies. That makes  given selection and barring injury  97 Tests. In other words, I want to continue to play until the end of next summer  when New Zealand and the West Indies are due to tour England  explained Hussain. After Englands first round exit at this years World Cup in South Africa, Hussain announced his retirement from ODI cricket, saying he no longer merited a place in the team. Stepping down as captain of the England one-day side obviously opens the door for a new leader, but I did that because I think the England one-day side will be better off without me. Just as I think, at the moment, the Test side will be better off with me remaining in charge... Of course, if at any stage I feel the Test side will be better off without me I will again do the honourable thing. Englands most successful captain is late Peter May who led England to 20 victories in 41 Tests as skipper from 1955 to 1961. Hussain has won 15 of his 42 Tests in charge and so needs six more wins to overtake Mays mark. (AFP)  Copyright

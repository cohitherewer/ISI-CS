The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB to miss two frontliners
Margao: Reigning champions East Bengal will face JCT in the under-19 National Football League final Monday, but they will be without the two players who scored in Saturdays semi-final win over Dempo. Side-back Satyajit Dutta and striker Prasanta Chakraborty have both been ruled out after complaining of muscle strain. The team manager informed that Kingshuk Debnath and Surajit Bose will come in to the XI to replace the injured duo. That apart, what must bother East Bengal on the eve of the final is the fact that they had lost to the same opponents in the group league stage at their own backyard in Calcutta. That was a 2-3 defeat and setting the record straight is among the prominent points on East Bengals agenda. East Bengal have found the going difficult on the hard surface and to a large extent, their chances of winning will depend on how they get used to such unfamiliar conditions. JCT are a strong side, physically superior than East Bengal, and they also showed they have enough fighting qualities by overcoming an early deficit and clinching the issue through a golden goal in Saturdays semi-final win over Mahindra United.

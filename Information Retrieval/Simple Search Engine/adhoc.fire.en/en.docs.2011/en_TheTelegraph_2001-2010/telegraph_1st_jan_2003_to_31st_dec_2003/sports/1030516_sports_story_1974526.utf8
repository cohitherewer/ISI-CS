The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Big 4 to come together again
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: After its experiment with a Pacers Wing, the National Cricket Academy (NCA) is set to launch a Spinners Wing where talented tweakers from all over the country and from all age-groups will be put through the paces by an 11-member panel of stalwarts. The panel, set up by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, consists of the Big Four of Indian spin, Bishan Singh Bedi, Erappalli Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Srinivas Venkatraghavan, as well as Bapu Nadkarni, V.V. Kumar, Rajinder Goel, Padmakar Shivalkar, Shivlal Yadav, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan and Anil Kumble. They will meet in the city on May 30. According to BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya, the Wing will be set up after this first brainstorming session. The art of spin bowling, which helped India win so many matches in the past, now seems a dying art. The performance of the spinners, barring Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, leaves a lot to be desired, he said. Notably, the NCA had set up a Wing in 2001 for training budding quicks. The Pacers Wing, under the stewardship of Kapil Dev, never really took off. This time, however, things may be different with the Board chief asserting that the BCCI would want to go deep into the problems and draw up a detailed course of action.  Copyright

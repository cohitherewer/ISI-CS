The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leipus calls on Sourav 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Even as the Indian team reached Bhubaneswar for their match versus New Zealand Thursday, Indian team physio Andrew Leipus, in a break in transit to Bhubaneswar, paid a visit to Team India regular skipper Sourav Ganguly at the latters residence. This being a hurried trip, the physio could manage a short visit and checked out of his hotel too, in quick time and left for the match venue. Sourav, who is recuperating from a upper left thigh abscess, having been released from a city clinic only recently, has made himself available for the November 12 Bangalore tri-series tie versus Australia. The Australians made it to the final on Monday beating New Zealand by two wickets in a thriller. The final is on November 18 at the Eden Gardens.  Copyright

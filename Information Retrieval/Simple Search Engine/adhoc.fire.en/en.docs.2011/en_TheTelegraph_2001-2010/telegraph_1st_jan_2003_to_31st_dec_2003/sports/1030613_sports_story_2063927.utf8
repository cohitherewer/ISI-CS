The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Karnataka win 18-0
Chennai: Shiva Sankari slammed seven goals, including a hattrick, to help Karnataka storm into the quarter finals with a 18-0 rout of Jammu and Kashmir in the national football meet for women Thursday. Karnatakas massive victory put paid to the aspirations of Tripura, last years quarter finalists. The teams ended with a win, draw and defeat, but Karnatakas better goal difference took them past Tripura. Goa, who beat Tripura 1-0, was the other team to advance from this group. In group C, Punjab ousted Chandigarh with a 12-0 win, while Kerala drew with Haryana 1-1. Kerala finished with four points, with Punjab on six and a match in hand. Tripura, who needed a draw, were beaten by a 56th-minute goal by Sharon Fernandes. For Karnataka, Nesa Kumari opened the goal hunt in the 12th minute and then Sankari scored four goals. Amoolya (5), Vanitha (3) and Vinutha Jadhav (2) were the other scorers. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sidelined Smith recovers from friendly  fire
 - Pollocks successor says he  plays to win, even if it means fighting with teammates  Graeme Smith at  a press conference at Newlands in Cape Town Sunday.  (AFP)  Cape Town: Two months ago,  Western Province skipper Graeme Smith found himself on the  wrong end of a foul-mouthed confrontation with the South  African national team as Shaun Pollocks side played a World  Cup warm-up match at Greenpoint. Four weeks later, all was forgotten  as the 22-year-old Smith was called-up to replace the injured  Jonty Rhodes for the World Cup. Now, a further four weeks down  the line, Smith has come full circle by being named successor  to Pollock who was unceremoniously dumped following the  countrys failure to get past the first round of the tournament. It was in that warm-up match,  however, where Smith showed the sort of battling qualities  and tough skin which he will need if he is to rescue his  country from the doldrums. He stood his ground when he was  dismissed that day because he claimed the field restrictions  were being ignored and that the delivery should have been  called a no-ball. Pollock and his men were not impressed  as they pointed him towards the pavilion while angry swear  words were exchanged between them. That incident was pushed to one  side when Smith came back to the World Cup squad where he  eventually played three matches scoring 121 runs.  When reminded that he had clashed  with some of his teammates, Smith pointed out that when  he played cricket, he always played to win, regardless of  the opposition. Cricket is a game you have to  play at 100 per cent all the time, even if it means getting  into fights with your teammates, he said. It is believed Smith was chosen  precisely because of this aggressive and strong personality. We are looking at the 2007 World  Cup. It is a new era, chairman of selectors Omar Henry  said. Smith was widely regarded to have  been extremely unlucky to have missed out on the original  15-man squad as the selectors carried through their intention  of picking five non-White players. But Rhodes broken hand gave him  the opportunity to bid for World Cup glory. It was the toughest thing I have  had to deal with in my life, said Smith of his original  exclusion. Getting a century in the Test  (against pakistan) immediately after that made it easier  to deal with, and I was also amazed at the amount of support  I received, he said. I think I learnt a lot and matured  as a result of having been left out of the team. I knew I was on the reserve list,  so I had to keep in shape, and stay focused, said Smith,  who has played eight Tests and 22 one-dayers. But it still felt horrible when  I watched the team walk out at Newlands for the first game  against West Indies without me. Not just because it was a World  Cup  just missing out on playing for your country is always  hard. One thing is for certain, it will  get a lot tougher from now on.  Smith, who was born in Johannesburg  has played eight Test matches, with a top score of 200 against  Bangladesh at East London. He has two hundreds and two fifties. He has a creditable one-day record  as well, having played 22 matches with his highest score  being 99 versus Sri Lanka.  (AFP) Copyright

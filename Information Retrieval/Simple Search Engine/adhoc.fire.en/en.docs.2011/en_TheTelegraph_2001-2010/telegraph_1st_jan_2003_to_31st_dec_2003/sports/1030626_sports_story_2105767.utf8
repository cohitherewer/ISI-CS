 No bias, argues BCCI counsel
Hyderabad: The BCCI Wednesday refuted Mohammed Azharuddins charge of selective discrimination, saying he had no basis to allege that the board had adopted defective procedures. Arguing before the city civil court the boards counsel explained that the BCCI president is rule-bound to start a preliminary inquiry to any allegation against a player. He asserted that no rule, regulation or settled procedure was by-passed to make out a case of discriminatory action against Azharuddin.  (PTI)  Copyright

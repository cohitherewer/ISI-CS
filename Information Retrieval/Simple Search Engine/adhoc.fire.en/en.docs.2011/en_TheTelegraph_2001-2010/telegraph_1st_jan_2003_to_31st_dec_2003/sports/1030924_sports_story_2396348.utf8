Binu was forced to pull out of the race with fever. Binu, the younger brother of K.M. Beenamol, had earned silver at last years Busan Asian Games. The gold in this event went to Adam Abdu Ali of Qatar who won in 1:46.20 seconds. In mens 4x100 relay, the Indian team comprising Anil Kumar, Sanjay Ghosh, Piyush Kumar and Amit Saha finished fourth clocking 39.69. The Indians had clocked 39.93 in the heats.

Kuldeep Kumar (14:34.77) and Gulab Chand (14:37.36) finished fifth and sixth, respectively, in mens 5000m. Qatars Abdulrahman Amri Abdelaziz won the gold stopping the clock in 13:58.89. Qatar also won the 400m hurdles through Mobarak Sultan al-Nobi to finish the meet in second place. The Chinese, who topped the medals tally, grabbed six golds on the final day to raise their four-day tally to 19.

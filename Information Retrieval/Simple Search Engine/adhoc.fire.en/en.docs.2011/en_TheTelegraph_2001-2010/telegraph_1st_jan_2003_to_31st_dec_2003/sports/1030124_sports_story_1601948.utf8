(AFP)																								Milan: AC Milan and AS Roma reached the last four of the Italian Cup after enjoying high scoring wins in their quarter final, second leg matches on Wednesday.																								Marco Delvecchio scored a first-half hattrick as Roma beat Serie B club Vicenza 6-3 to set up a derby clash with Lazio in the semi-finals, while Clarence Seedorf was on target twice for Milan in their 5-2 win at Chievo.																								Roma, who led 2-1 from last weeks first leg, suffered an early setback when Brazilian midfielder Jeda fired Vicenza ahead on the night with a low drive in the fifth minute.																								Fabio Capellos side responded five minutes later when Cafu burst down the right flank and crossed to Francesco Totti, who put in Delvecchio with a neat back-heel and the Roma striker fired home.																								Delvecchio then put Roma ahead in the 21st minute when he converted from another Cafu cross. Totti created Romas third goal in the 37th when his reverse pass gave Delvecchio space on the left flank and the lanky forward cut inside and completed his hattrick.																								Two minutes later Totti again exposed the gaps in the Vicenza defence with a through ball to Emerson, which the Brazilian midfielder took full advantage of with a confident strike.																								Vicenza pulled one back on the stroke of half-time when Stefan Schwoch was brought down by Roma goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli and the former Napoli forward rose to convert the spot kick. The visitors narrowed the gap further in the 75th with Claudio Rivalta scoring from close range, but once again Vicenzas hopes of a comeback were short-lived. Emerson made it 5-3 after a well-timed run onto a chip from substitute Antonio Cassano left him in acres of space and he beat Andrea Campagnolo with ease.																								Cafu completed the rout, and an 8-4 aggregate victory, three minutes from the end via the penalty spot.																								Advantage Deportivo 																								Kings Cup holders Deportivo La Coruna needed a late Aldo Duscher strike to beat Murcia 1-0 on Wednesday and earn a slim advantage to take into next weeks quarter final second leg away to the second division side, adds a report from Madrid.																								Deportivo were limited to a couple of first half chances as Murcia showed why they are strongly tipped for promotion with some neat passing and a disciplined defensive display. (REUTERS)

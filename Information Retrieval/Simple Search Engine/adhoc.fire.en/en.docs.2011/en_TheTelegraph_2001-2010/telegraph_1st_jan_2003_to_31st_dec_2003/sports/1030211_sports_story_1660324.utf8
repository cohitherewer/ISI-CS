 Aussies unlikely to retain Cup: Sobers
 Barbados: Caribbean cricket legend Sir Garfield Sobers has tipped the West Indies along with India and Sri Lanka to win the World Cup and dethrone reigning champions Australia. Everyone has Australia as the number one World Cup team but I dont believe that Australians are going to win the World Cup, Sobers said. I believe that somewhere, probably the West Indies will have a good chance as well as India and Sri Lanka, Sobers said in St Lucia. He was there for the launch of the historic double World Cup in April. I think the lower teams have got a tremendous chance of winning the World Cup. They realise there is an opportunity for them in one-day cricket and they build their game particularly for the World Cup, Sobers said. I think that is where you are going to find teams like New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is always a force to reckon with at the one-day level, he said. Australia do have Adam Gilchrist, who is known as one of the best one-day players. Matthew Hayden is the kind of player who could tear bowling apart, and captain Ricky Ponting, so theyve got fairly good one-day players. Sobers also said Brian Lara remains the no.1 batsman in the West Indian team and will be a big factor in the teams fortunes during the tournament. Lara is always going to be a force to reckon with and he is always going to be a great contributor to West Indies cricket, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

 Sandhu to coach Orissa
Cuttack, Sept. 13 (PTI): Ba lwinder Singh Sandhu has been appointed coach of the Orissa Ranji Trophy team for the upcoming season, Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) secretary Asirbad Behera said last night. OCA signed an agreement with Sandhu for a period of seven months and will take charge from October 15. The appointment of an outstation and professional coach was necessitated in view of the state Ranji teams disappointing performance last season when it slid from the elite group to the plate division of the national championship, Behera said. Sandhu replaces Asjit Jayaprakasham.  Copyright

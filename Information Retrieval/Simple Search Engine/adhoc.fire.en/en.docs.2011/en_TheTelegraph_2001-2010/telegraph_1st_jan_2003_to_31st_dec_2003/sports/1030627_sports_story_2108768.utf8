 ICC, FICA at loggerheads again
London: The ICC and the Federation of International Cricketers Associations (FICA) are at each others throats again. While FICA threatened that it would make negotiations for Player Terms for future ICC tournaments more difficult, the ICC came down heavily asking it to desist from making clumsy attempts to threaten or undermine the game. ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said instead of making such threats FICAs leadership should be taking a step back trying to understand why so many of the Boards around the world are so vehemently opposed to it. Another battle is looming, FICA chief executive Tim May was quoted as saying. May said the ICCs refusal to have a players representative on the powerful management committee showed a complete lack of respect for players around the world. Speed claimed support for FICA had gone down and despite repeated recommendations by ICC, majority of the Boards were not ready to give it recognition. FICAs stated objective is to work with local governing bodies but its not doing this effectively, he said. If FICAs leaders believe that recognition by all Boards is needed to advance the cause of players, they need to ask themselves why countries with FICA-affiliated associations are blocking this move.

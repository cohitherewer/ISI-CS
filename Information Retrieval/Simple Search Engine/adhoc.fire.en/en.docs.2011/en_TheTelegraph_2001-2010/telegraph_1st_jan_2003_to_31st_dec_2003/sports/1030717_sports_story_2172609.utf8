The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Meet in city from Sept. 17
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The national aquatic championships, returning to Bengal, will be held at the Subhas Sarobar pool complex in the city from September 17 to 22. About 800 are expected to participate in the meet which has assumed greater significance among the swimming fraternity since the Indian contingent for the Afro-Asian Games will be selected on the basis of the swimmers performance in this meet. Bengal last hosted the nationals in 2000 while last years meet was held in Thrissur. The 2001 nationals were not held. The championships were earlier scheduled to take place from September 15. However, the proposed renovation of railway tracks at Howrah station from September 12 to 14, which will lead to heavy disruption of train service, have forced the organisers, Bengal Amateur Swimming Association (BASA) to delay the meets inauguration by a couple of days. The Bengal squad for the meet will be selected after the August 15-17 state championships, BASA secretary Ramanuj Mukhopadhyay said on Wednesday. However, Akbar Ali Mir will be again Bengals best bet and hes likely to compete in as many as five events. Meanwhile, the BASA has requisitioned electronic timing machines as well as duro-flex boards from the nodal agency, Sports Authority of India for the springboard event. According to the BASA official, no sponsor for the meet has yet been found.  Copyright

 Kirmani stress on follow-up programmes
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Kirmani Calcutta, Aug. 30: One regular complaint against the zonal wings of the National Cricket Academy has been the lack of follow-up programme. And that is something which shouldnt be happening to their wards at the CAB, feel Syed Kirmani and Laxman Sivaramakrishnan. On the last day of the seven-day camp with some of the young spinners and wicketkeepers, both of them felt Bengal is not short of talent. But what is absolutely necessary is the right grooming. Weve interacted with them individually, discussed their strengths and weaknesses and gave them the necessary tips. But now it is upto them and their coaches to carry on from where we leave, Kirmani said. Sivaramakrishnan informed both of them had a session with the coaches of the different age groups of Bengal. There we have told what is to be done. We have assured the boys performance will be strictly monitored on a regular basis, the former India leg-spinner added. In fact, both of them would be glad to be back if the CAB intends to. Its a step in the right direction and well surely be back, if invited. Kirmani said. I will tell the BCCI to instruct the different associations to have similar camps in the other states. Then we can have a talent pool and get them to work together at the National Cricket Academy in the future, he added. Coming back to the current stint, Kirmani said that the video analysis programme that was conducted was a big help. He also didnt sound too enthusiastic about the new trend of having trainers, physios and psychologists with the team. More than that, we need specialist coaches. Only a specialist can point out where a player is going wrong.  Sivaramakrishnan singled out off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri and left-arm spinner Anirban Chatterjee for special mention. Sourashish took 20 odd wickets in the KSCA meet, which is known to be one of the most fiercely competitive tournaments. I think he deserved a place in one of the teams for the Challenger meet.  Souravs meeting Indian captain Sourav Ganguly had an informal meeting with Kirmani at the CAB gymnasium. Kirmani informed that Sourav asked him about the progress of the boys and how they are doing. This shows his concern for Bengal cricket. I was happy to give him the necessary information, Kirmani said. Kirmani has said that it was imperative that stars take part in domestic meets as well.

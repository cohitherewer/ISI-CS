The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Move to spread AIDS awareness
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Jagmohan Dalmiya and Ehsan Mani present a bat, autographed by members of the 1983 World Cup-winning Indian squad, to a group of children in Mumbai on Thursday. The children are part of the UNAIDS programme. (Reuters) Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have joined hands with UNAIDS to help spread awareness about the killer disease. The tie-up, which will eventually take many forms, was announced here on Thursday afternoon. The announcement was made in the presence of Ehsan Mani and Jagmohan Dalmiya, heads of the ICC and the BCCI, respectively, and it has been decided that a HIV-positive person will toss the coin in the Ahmedabad Test versus New Zealand  the match, incidentally, will be Team Indias first commitment in the 2003-2004 season. Asked by The Telegraph whether the BCCI would specifically use Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar in an awareness campaign, Dalmiya replied: Its possible, but Im not making a commitment straightaway... First, lets see how this partnership grows... According to Mani, bats autographed by all 14 teams which competed in this years World Cup will be auctioned online by the ICC and proceeds will go towards helping the agencies battling the disease in India. Its not insignificant, perhaps, that the ICC is the first (international) sporting bo- dy to have a tie-up with UNAIDS. Dalmiya, it may be recalled, was president when the ICC first joined hands with the UN.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 Dalmiya may meet teams thinktank
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Captain Sourav Ganguly, who is spending a few days at home before leading India in the World Cup, caught in a relaxed mood at his residence on Tuesday afternoon. Sourav will be back at the gym on Wednesday and nets a day later. Picture by Santosh Ghosh																								Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, is likely to have a closed-door session with the national teams thinktank before the World Cup XV heads for South Africa next Wednesday.																								According to The Telegraphs sources, Dalmiya may meet captain Sourav Ganguly, vice-captain Rahul Dravid and coach John Wright in the city itself  possibly on Sunday.																								Its not exactly confirmed, but chances are that Wright and Dravid will be invited to come over for a few hours, is how a source put it.																								Dalmiya, obviously, will be looking back and ahead. While much of the interaction should revolve around the February 8-March 25 World Cup, the president is bound to also discuss Indias disastrous tour of New Zealand.																								Yet, given that the meeting will only be days before the departure for the World Cup, its unlikely that a pucca post-mortem will be undertaken. Surely, the president isnt going to say anything that will affect the mental preparation for the sports biggest event, remarked another source.																								Incidentally, Wrights contract will be up for renewal after the World Cup. Physio Andrew Leipus and physical trainer Adrian Le Rouxs as well.																								Meanwhile, with the Player Terms dispute unresolved, theres uncertainty over who will be named manager. Chief selector Brijesh Patel, it may be recalled, held that post during the last World Cup.																								Picking the XV was relatively easy, getting the right manager is going to be tough, quipped a source.																								Apparently, Dalmiya is keen that somebody conversant with contracts and anti-doping regulations be appointed but, then, few in the BCCI qualify.																								Amrit Mathur, a former Sports Authority of India secretary, though, could come into the frame. Its not insignificant, perhaps, that he was manager during Indias first-ever tour of South Africa, back in 1992-93.																								Generally, lobbying for such a prize assignment begins weeks before the appointment is made. This time, the build-up has been different.																								An announcement, however, is expected on Wednesday  after the BCCIs working committee session in the capital.

																								New Delhi: Delhis hopes of forcing an outright win received a jolt with inclement weather wiping out more than three hours of play on Day III of their Ranji Trophy group A match against Bengal at the Kotla Monday.																								The days proceedings got off well-past noon and was called off five minutes before the scheduled close. 																								Delhi, resuming at 198 for one, took their score to 343 for seven setting Bengal a target of 339. At stumps, the visitors were two for no loss.																								After Akash Chopra (94), Gautam Gambhir (96) became the second Delhi batsman to miss out on his century.																								Left-arm spinner Utpal Chatterjee bowled a very good line and length to take three for 83 while paceman Ranadeb Bose took three for 71. 																								On Sunday, a century opening stand between Gambhir and Chopra boosted Delhis hopes of an outright win on Day II after Bengal managed a five-run first innings lead. 																								At stumps, Gambhir was unbeaten on 93 and Varun Kumar on nought. Chopra was dismissed for 94, two overs before stumps.																								Earlier, Subhomoy Das scored 66 to help Bengal take the vital first-innings lead. (PTI)

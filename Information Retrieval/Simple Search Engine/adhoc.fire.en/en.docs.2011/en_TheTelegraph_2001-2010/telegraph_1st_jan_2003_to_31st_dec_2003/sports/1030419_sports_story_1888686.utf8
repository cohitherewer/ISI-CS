The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Cup-winning squad for ODIs
 MARTYN: Has to pass fitness test Port-of-Spain: The Australian squad that won the World Cup has been selected for next months one-day series with the West Indies. The only player involved in the World Cup who did not make the squad was fast bowler Nathan Bracken, who was only called up as cover for injured paceman Jason Gillespie, who is fit again. Winning a tournament as important as that is a fairly good indicator that at this point in time, we have the right player-mix at the one-day International level, Australias chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said in a statement. The players we have selected all deserve their place in the squad.. Batsman Damien Martyn was selected pending a fitness test. The West Australian broke his finger in South Africa, forcing him to miss the Test series against but is expected to recover in time for the one-dayers. We will keep close watch on his progress and make a decision on his availability for the series based on the relevant medical advice, closer to the time of departure, Hohns said. Glenn McGrath , who left the tour to return home when his wife was diagnosed with cancer, was chosen as doctors said his wifes illness was fully treatable. Australia and the West Indies are scheduled to play each other in seven one-day Internationals between May 17 and June 1.

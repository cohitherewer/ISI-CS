The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I think I scored 6: Bhutia
Jakarta: Bhaichung Bhutia claimed he had scored all the six goals in Wednesdays demolition of Army FC of the Philippines. It feels nice to have won and also to have scored so many goals. I actually scored the sixth goal as well. The ball hit me first before it went into the goal. I dont know what the officials will decide but it doesnt matter to me. If its five goals Ill be happy, and if its six goals Ill also be happy. If its six, it will be the first time I have achieved this in an international match. The huge victory, however, has failed to enthuse coach Subhas Bhowmick. Although we won comfortably, the team made many mistakes throughout the match. There are some loopholes in our game and we must work on it before the quarter finals. We have four days to prepare and we will have to work on our game. We are not bothered about who we meet in the next round. In a tournament like this, we must be prepared to face any team. Even if we have to meet the host side, it doesnt matter. Persita Tangerang is a good side but we will be well prepared. Philippines coach, Arnel Fernandez, said: This is our first time in an international club championship. Our players are young and inexperienced and it showed today.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

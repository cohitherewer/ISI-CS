The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gibbs works up for a ton 
Durban: Opener Herschelle Gibbs is ready for South Africas crunch World Cup group B tie with Sri Lanka on Monday, when he is determined to score his first one-day century at Kingsmead. South Africa have to beat Sri Lanka if they are to qualify for the Super Sixes and the in-form Gibbs will be relied on heavily to get them off to a good start. Gibbs has scored 311 runs in five innings at the Cup with an average of 103.66 and a strike rate of 106.14. Im happy. Im where I want to be mentally, Gibbs said after a rain-curtailed practice session in Durban on Saturday. I havent got a one-day hundred here at Kingsmead yet, so that becomes a target. I really wanted to go out and get a hundred at The Wanderers .  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bruce Reid set for a short term 
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Team management wants Reid before the first Test itself Calcutta: Besides tackling the Abhijit Kale issue, the emergent working committee meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), to be held on Sunday, is expected to take a decision on the short-term appointment of Australian Bruce Reid as the countrys bowling coach. According to The Telegraphs sources, the contract will probably be for the four-Test series only  of course, the left-armer could be retained for the tri-series as well. If Reid actually has a big impact, the BCCI will open negotiations for a long-term arrangement. PTI adds from Melbourne: Sources indicated that the team management has spoken to the BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya to have Reid before the first Test in Brisbane itself starting on December 4. Coach John Wright has already got in touch with Reid and it is learnt the paceman is not averse to the idea. Reid had earlier helped out Zimbabwe on their recent Australia tour and provided inside information to the tourists, something which will be handy for the Indians as well. He has also been credited for the astonishing rise of Nathan Bracken. Reid coaches Hampshire, a team he played for as an overseas professional in the 1980s. He played 27 Tests taking 113 wickets at an average of 24.63. The left-armer made a huge impression against India during their tour of Australia in the 1991-92, claiming 12 wickets at an average of 11.33. Earlier, the names of Wasim Akram and Jawagal Srinath had made the rounds as probable candidates for bowling coach. In fact, Sourav Ganguly, immediately after landing in Australia went on record that he would like Akram, here on a TV commentary assignment, to give a few tips to his young pacers like Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan.

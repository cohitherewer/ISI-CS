 Amritinder in lead after Day One
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Three-time winner Amritinder Singh returned an opening round of five-under 67 at the Rs 10 lakh Hero Golf Chandigarh Open Thursday. According to information received here, defending champion Arjun Singh, Rahil Gangjee and Harmeet Kahlon were in second spot with three-under 69. Amandeep Johl was tied for fifth with Bhoop Singh, Rohtas Singh and Jaiveer Virk three-strokes behind the leader at two-under 70. Amritinder wasted little time in asserting his superiority. Warming up with a par, Amritinder almost immediately changed gears to eagle the second and birdie the third. He erred only once when he missed a two-and-half foot par putt to bogey the fifth. His back nine saw him hit a hattrick of birdies on the 12th, 13th and 14th. Arjun looked equally determined. Despite a card of 69, he looked far from happy. I didnt putt well at all. Otherwise, I would well have fired a five or six under, Arjun said.  Copyright

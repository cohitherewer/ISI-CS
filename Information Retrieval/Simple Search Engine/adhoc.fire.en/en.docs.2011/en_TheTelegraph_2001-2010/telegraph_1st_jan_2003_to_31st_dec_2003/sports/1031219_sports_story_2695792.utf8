The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indias stand accepted 
New Delhi: The controversy over the participation of a depleted Indian hockey team in the Azlan Shah meet in Kuala Lumpur blew over on Thursday when Malaysian authorities said they would accept the side which is being fielded on good faith. The Malaysian Hockey Federation (MHF) said it has accepted Indias explanation on the team selection for the January 8-18 seven-nation meet. After the IHF announced a list of 25 probables, comprising just seven senior players, MHF threatened to scratch the Indian team if it had just second-stringers. (PTI)  Copyright

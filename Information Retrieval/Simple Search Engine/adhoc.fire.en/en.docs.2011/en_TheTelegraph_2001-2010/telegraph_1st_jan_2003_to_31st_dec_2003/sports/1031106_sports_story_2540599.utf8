 Bengal take 83-run lead
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: A fine knock by Abhishek Bhowmick and responsible batting by skipper Rohan Bannerji helped Bengal overcome early setbacks and take a first-innings lead of 83 against Bihar on the second and penultimate day of the under-15 Polly Umrigar meet league tie at the Keenan Stadium on Wednesday. Bihar, in their second essay, were 18 for two at stumps. They had made 108 in the first innings and face an uphill battle to avoid an outright defeat. Resuming at 13 without loss, Bengal lost Srivats Goswami after the addition of 12 runs. Joydeep Roy did not last long either. Bengal were soon 37 for four with spinners M. Mishra, Prashant Rahul and Ishank Jaggi bowling a tidy length. Bannerji and Bhowmick then added 58 for the fifth wicket before the skipper departed for 37 (off 141 balls). Bhowmick played some attractive shots en route to 56. Avik Adhikari made an unbeaten 46 to ensure a healthy lead for Bnegal. BRIEF SCORES Bihar 108 and 18/2. Bengal 191 (A. Bhowmick 56, A. Adhikari 46 not out, R Bannerji 37; P. Rahul 3/55, I. Jaggi 3/56, M. Mishra 2/66).  Copyright

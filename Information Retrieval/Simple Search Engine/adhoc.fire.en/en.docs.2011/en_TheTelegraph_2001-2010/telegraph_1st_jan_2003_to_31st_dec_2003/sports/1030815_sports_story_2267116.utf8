The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, August 15, 2003  Stewards decision hailed 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Industrialist Deepak Khaitan, who is also one of the leading horseowners in the country, has been inducted as an RCTC steward and good things are already beginning to happen in city racing. Unlike previous weeks when offenders were treated leniently, there were two suspensions, a big fine, on Wednesday, and the stipendiary stewards report published after the days races, did not read like a routine sermon. More importantly, the stewards decisions on the day were welcomed in the racing circles. The changing scenario, therefore, gives some hope to the citys racing fraternity because the unanimously elected steward is the one who has good knowledge about the thoroughbred racing. Khaitan has replaced Haik H. Sookias who had resigned recently.

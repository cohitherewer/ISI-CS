The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Some cash for Bagan players 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagan players received part of their outstanding payment on Wednesday ahead of their away match against Haywards Sporting Club on Sunday. The crisis over payment to the players got over following the sponsors UB Groups meeting with the clubs rival factions. However, Jose Ramirez Barreto is yet to receive his cheque. A club official said that the Brazilian would receive his money before Sundays match. Meanwhile, coach Aloke Mukherjee is aiming at getting at least three points from the same number of away matches. Salgaocar and Churchill Brothers are Mohun Bagans next opponents. Meanwhile, buoyed by two back-to-back wins at home, East Bengal are determined to keep the momentum going as they leave for Goa to face Dempo SC on Saturday. Coach Subhas Bhowmick, however, has already set his agenda on the away matches: not to lose a point. Dempo is always dangerous at home. But my target is simple, if we cant win, we should not lose it either, Bhowmick told reporters on Wednesday. In their next match, the defending champions will take on Mahindra United in Mumbai on Wednesday. Bhowmick also said he had sent his reply to the IFA showcause regarding his anti-association comments.  Copyright

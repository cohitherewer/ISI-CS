		 Saturday, December 27, 2003  Castle Park fancied 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 Rashid Byramji				 										Bangalore: It is hard to look beyond the Rashid Byramji-ward Castle Park in the 1,200m Shantiniketan Cup on Friday. The four-year-old filly by Diffident out of Mystic Memory is not only working well, she is also a good sprinter.				 										Castle Parks main opposition will come from Star Wind but going by their summer form, its looking hard to visualise Park getting beaten in the hands of the in-form jockey. Harish.

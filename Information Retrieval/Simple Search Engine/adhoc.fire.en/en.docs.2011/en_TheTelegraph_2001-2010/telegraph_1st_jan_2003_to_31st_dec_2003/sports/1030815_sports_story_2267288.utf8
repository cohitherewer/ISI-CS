 NZ cops to visit Ahmedabad
Ahmedabad: A security team from New Zealand will soon be here to review arrangements for the Test against India to be played at the Sardar Patel Gujarat Stadium in October, a senior official said on Thursday. The Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) is not taking any chances with arrangements, said Narhari Amin, president of the association. Amin, however, added the visit of the police team from New Zealand should not be viewed as concern on account of communal tension after the post-Godhra riots or any terrorist threat but as a standard procedure. The police and security team will want detailed information pertaining to security arrangements made by the state government and the GCA. They will want to know where their players will stay and security arrangements there apart from the travel plans, Amin said. He said security and accommodations for New Zealand fans coming to watch the Test will also be supervised by the police team.  (PTI)  Copyright

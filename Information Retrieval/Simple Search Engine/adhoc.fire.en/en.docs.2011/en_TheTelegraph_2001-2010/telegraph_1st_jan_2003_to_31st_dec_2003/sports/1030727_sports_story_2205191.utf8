 Bhandari scalps six 
London, July 26 (PTI): Lanky speedster Amit Bhandaris six-wicket burst on the final day was the highlight of the three-day match between India A and Glamorgan which ended in a draw at Swansea on Saturday. Bhandaris wickets helped India A take a first innings lead of 25 as the hosts were bundled out for 140 in reply to the visitors 165. India were 27 for one in 10 overs in their second innings when the match was called off. The visitors lost their first wicket in the second over of the innings when Satyajit Parab (0), opening the innings, was snapped by Michael Powell off David Harrison. When the match ended, Parthiv Patel was batting on 14 and Vijay Bhardwaj on 12. Earlier, resuming at 104 for four, Glamorgan could add only 36 runs to their overnight score before losing all their remaining batsmen as Bhandari wreaked havoc claiming wickets at regular intervals. Bhandari, who had taken two wickets on Friday, took four more on Saturday to finish with figures of six for 38.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 F1 test drive for Narain 
Chennai, Dec. 13 (PTI): Indias Narain Karthikeyan drove for European Minardi Cosworth on the final day of an important three-day test for the team at the Vallelunga circuit near Rome on Friday, gaining additional Formula One experience, according to information reaching here.  It was great to be back in a Formula One car. Id particularly like to thank Paul Stoddart (team principal) and the team for giving me this opportunity and I hope todays test will now encourage some of Indias major corporates to support my efforts to secure a Formula One seat in 2004, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, August 14, 2003  Smart Charmer lifts Independence Cup 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 Merchant on Smart Charmer (left) winning the Independence Cup from Richie Rich.				 										Calcutta: Expectations were high from trainer Daniel David, on Wednesday, and the champion schooler managed three winners, including the course-favourite Smart Charmer who lifted the Independence Cup. His other winners were rank-outsiders, Terrificco and Direct Access. 				 										However, with Daniels favourites failing to deliver in most of the six-event card, the grand enclosure crowd became restive and hurled abuses, thus prompting the trainer into a verbal altercation. Daniel was, however, escorted to safety before matter got out of hand.				 										In the Prince Blossom Cup, the F. Rodrigues-trained Hello Brother had to fight Daniels lesser fancied El Cid, virtually the entire length of the stretch, before he could stake a claim at the trophy. El Cids 12-10 stable-favourite Another Time placed third.				 										Following stewards enquiries into the running of Meadow Royale (Som Singh up) on August 7, and Lively Project (Apprentice A. P. Singh) on Wednesday, the two jockeys were suspended for three and four race days, respectively. Meadow Royales trainer D. Karki was also fined Rs 5,000.

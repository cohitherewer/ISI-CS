The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Afridi for longer captaincy tenures 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Junaid Zia stretches out at the Eden on Sunday Calcutta: Captains in Pakistan are almost as uncertain to last for long as football coaches in Brazil are. Shahid Afridi, for one, has played under quite a few and is now the leader of his countrys A team. He knows how difficult it can be for players, if the skippers hat keeps changing and says its prudent to stick to one. One should get a long run, Afridi said on Sunday. After Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis was there for a while. Since then, Pakistan have already had two captains. It can be unsettling and bring down the morale of the team, said Afridi. The charismatic and flamboyant player said it was a pleasure to play under Akram. He knew what to expect from each player and how to bring out the best from them. He knew exactly how and when to use them. Afridi said one of his priorities other than making it back to the national team is to control his volatile temperament and live up to the responsibility entrusted on him. He was in Durban before being called up for this tour and that trip was a part of his learning curve. Not that I was getting very well paid there. It is just that we get the kind of pitches there which we dont come across in the sub-continent. Places like Australia and South Africa help you get used to harder wickets. Pakistan A coach Naved Anjum said he was very hopeful about the future of his countrys pace attack. In Pakistan, everybody wants to bowl fast. This is more evident in the suburbs. Right now we have a pool of 25-30 fast bowlers who can make it to the national side and I am telling you that about 10-12 of them are genuinely quick. We will probably not suffer from the absence of fast bowlers. Afridi and Anjum spoke in favour of the selection of the controversial Junaid Zia  son of Tauqir Zia who resigned as the PCB chief recently. He has been one of our most consistent bowlers in recent times, they said.  Dravid special: Vishy Former India great Gundappa Viswanath, here as Match Referee, rated Rahul Dravid as one of the five all-time great batsmen the country has produced. He is definitely one of the five greatest Indian batsmen ever, Viswanath said. However, he refused to name the other four. On Dravid, Viswanath said he had played a number of excellent knocks in the past. But this time people are sitting up and taking notice as he has played such a spectacular match-winner against Australia in Adelaide. He added that the partnership between Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman was special. This is the second time they have scripted such a large partnership. This shows their excellent understanding. Otherwise, they would not have been able to stitch together such a long partnership twice in Test cricket.  Copyright

 Davenport to defend title
Tokyo: Three-time champion Lindsay Davenport will return to Tokyo in February to defend the only title the American has won this season at the Pan-Pacific Open, organisers said on Wednesday. The 27-year-old former world No. 1 had surgery for a nagging left foot injury in October, which bothered her almost all year, and missed the remainder of the season. Davenport hopes to recover in time for the Australian Open in Melbourne, which begins January 19. The $1.3 million indoor event, starting from February 3, will be Davenports third attempt at defending the title with victories in 1998, 2001 and last year. Her main rivals include fellow American Jennifer Capriati, who will make her first appearance after a second-round defeat in the 1992 event, and Sydney Olympic silver medallist Elena Dementieva of Russia.

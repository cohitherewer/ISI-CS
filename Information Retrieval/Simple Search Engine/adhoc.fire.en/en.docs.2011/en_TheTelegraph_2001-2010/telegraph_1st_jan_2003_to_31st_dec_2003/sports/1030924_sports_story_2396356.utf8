The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ticket rates to go up
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The ticket rates for the tri-series final in Eden Gardens on November 18 will see an increase. The decision was taken at Tuesdays CAB working committee meeting. The exact rates will be finalised later. Meanwhile, Saradindu Mukherjee has been inducted into the CAB junior selection committee. The former India off-spinner is one of three new faces in the committee. The others to have been included are former Bengal Ranji player Arup Bhattacharya, who will be chairman of the committee, and Goutam Shome (senior). In the senior selection committee, former junior committee chairman Robin Mukherjee will replace Snehashish Ganguly, whose term ended this season. The rest of the panel remains unchanged. Meanwhile, the CAB has formally appointed Ranadip Moitra as the new physical trainer of the senior as well as the age-group Bengal squads.  Copyright

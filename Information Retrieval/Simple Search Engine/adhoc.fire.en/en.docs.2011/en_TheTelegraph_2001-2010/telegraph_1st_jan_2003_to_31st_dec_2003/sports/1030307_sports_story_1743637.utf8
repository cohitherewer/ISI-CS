 Fifa puts off world youth meet
Zurich: Fifa has postponed the World Youth Championship in the UAE because of safety fears triggered by the threat of war against Iraq, world soccers governing body said Thursday. The 24-team tournament for players under 20 was due to start on March 25 and end on April 16. But it will now take place at an unspecified later date after Fifas executive committee decided the political climate in the Middle East posed a threat to the safety of the players. Teams due to take part in the tournament in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah included the US, England, Australia and Spain. Any war against Iraq is expected to start in the next few weeks.

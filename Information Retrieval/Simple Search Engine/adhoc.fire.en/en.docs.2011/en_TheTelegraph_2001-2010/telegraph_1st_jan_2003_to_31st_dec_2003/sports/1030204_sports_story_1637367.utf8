				 																																	Sydney: Australia Test leg spinner Stuart MacGill has been suspended for two inter-state matches after a heated exchange with an umpire during a one-day game.				 																																	MacGill, who has taken 94 wickets in 19 Tests, faced a disciplinary hearing with New South Wales cricket officials on Monday where commissioner Alan Sullivan found the 31-year-old guilty of using crude or abusive language or gestures.				 																																	He will miss the next two matches for New South Wales, a four-day game against Victoria starting on February 5 and a one-day match on February 9 against the same team. MacGill was personally counselled by Australian Cricket Board chief executive James Sutherland in October 2001 after he was fined for verbally abusing an umpire in an inter-state match. He was also officially reprimanded after colliding with Ramnaresh Sarwan in the third Test against the West Indies in Adelaide in December, 2000.

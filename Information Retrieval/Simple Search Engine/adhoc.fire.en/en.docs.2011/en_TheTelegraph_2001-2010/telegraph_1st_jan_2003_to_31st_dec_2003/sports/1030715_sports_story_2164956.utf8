 2 more wins for Chandhok
 Chandhok has most wins, but is still at 2nd spot Chennai: Budding Indian racing talent Karun Chandhok scored double-race wins in the 24-round Scholarship Class of the British Formula III racing championship in England Sunday. Chandhok has now achieved the feat of winning six races, more than anybody else competing in the race. The 19-year-old scored the wins at the Outlon Park race circuit in the 13th and 14th rounds for his eighth podium finish this season. But, on 185 points, he continued to trail Steven Kane (UK, 196) in the overall position. Driving for the T-Sport team, Chandhok sponsored by JK Tyres, had opened the season, winning at Donington Park. Since then he finished first in three successive events  one at Croft and two at Silverstone and took his tally of firsts to six by winning the events Sunday. Besides this, Chandhok had finished second (Snetterton) and third (Knockhill) twice each and fourth once but could not finish in the remaining three events. According to a release by T-Sport, there was a goodly at the events Sunday and with the temperatures soaring to 35 degrees Celsius, the drivers were concerned about tyre degradation. In the 13th race qualifying, Chandok found the going tough due to the change in grip levels of the circuit and had to settle for third place. But in the next qualifying, the Indian improved his prospects and returned the best lap timing of 1:32.390 seconds, which was enough for pole position. But the stewards disallowed the race as one of the drivers spun off.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Justice Banerjee has quit
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagans crisis is far from over with the resignation on Monday of one of the three Special Officers, appointed by the high court to oversee football-related matters of the club. Justice Umesh Banerjee has resigned today, club secretary Anjan Mitra said. We went to his house to attend a meeting called by him to resolve our crisis. But we were told that the meeting had been cancelled and that he had resigned, the secretary said. The two other Special Officers, Justice Shyamal Sen and Indrajit Sen, did not comment while Justice Banerjees telephone remained unanswered. The Special Officers had formed a two-member body, with a representative each of Mohun Bagans opposing groups, and assigned them the task of completing the players transfer-related matters within the deadline. However, on Saturday both officials sought release from their duty. It was to resolve this impasse that Mondays meeting had been called.  Copyright

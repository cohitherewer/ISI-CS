				 																																	Paris: Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon has been told he can have Paris Saint Germains (PSG) Brazilian star Ronaldinho for 45 million euros ($52 million).				 																																	PSG president Francis Graille, due to meet Kenyon and United directors David Gill and Maurice Watkins on Wednesday, has been boosted by major shareholder Canal Plus Televisions decision to raise 20 million euros for the cash-strapped club.				 																																	If they come with an offer of 45 million euros things can go very fast, Graille told the Le Parisien.				 																																	United were reported to have offered $24 million.				 																																	PSG coach Vahid Halilhodzic has changed his attitude towards the player. When he was appointed last month, the coach refused to contemplate Ronaldinho leaving. Of course if we get a good offer we have to consider it, he said.

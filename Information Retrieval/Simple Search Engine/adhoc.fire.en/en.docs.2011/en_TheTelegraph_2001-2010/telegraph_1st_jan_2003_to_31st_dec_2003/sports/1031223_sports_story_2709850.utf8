 Gaurav emerges champion
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Chennai: Local boy Gaurav Dalal became the new titlist in the JK Tyre National Championships from the final two laps in the FISSME category here on Sunday. In the close last race he outpaced Delhis Gaurav Gill to dethrone defending champion Sarosh Hataria, also of Chennai. For Hataria, it was a harrowing experience, with his driveshaft popping out in the pit lane. As per rules he had to start from the pit lane itself, following the field, and could never really come back into the race. Amanpreet Ahluwalia from Noida finished third, in the 2.1km shortened loop at the Madras Motor Sports Clubs Irungankatukottai track near Sriperumbudur. The Esteem saloon category race was won by former racer K.D.Madans son J.D.Madan, cruising through both the days races in a rather sunny afternoon, taking the crown from Radha Selvaraj who finished second. Interestingly, the Formula LGB novice category (modified Esteem engine cars) was won by a girl from Tokyo, Kieho Ihara.  In a usually men-only field, her race was commendable in guts too, this being a new category. She said she has run 16 races so far and races around south and southeast Asia. She also wants to take part in the Formula Nippon next year. The champions were awarded an Esteem (for Madan) and an Alto (Dalal) by sponsors Maruti Suzuki.  Copyright

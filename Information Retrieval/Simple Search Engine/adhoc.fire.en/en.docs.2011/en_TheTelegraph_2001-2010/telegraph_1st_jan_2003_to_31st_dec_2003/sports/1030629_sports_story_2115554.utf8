The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WI all out for 191
Kingston, June 28 (Reuters): Sri Lanka off spinner Muttiah Muralidharan dragged his team back into the second Test on Saturday by dismissing Brian Lara leg before for just 10 runs. At 2 am, Sri Lanka were 18 for no loss in their second innings. Earlier, the West Indies were all out for 191. Nissanka took five wickets while Muralidharan claimed three. At lunch West Indies were 87 for three on the second day in reply to Sri Lankas 208. Prabath Nissanka had earlier dismissed both West Indies openers with an impressive spell of pace bowling on a lively Sabina Park pitch. Lara lashed Muralidharans first ball through the covers for four but was trapped in front in the next over.  Copyright

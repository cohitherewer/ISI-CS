The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jyoti in third spot, Atwal slips further
 - Bangkok Golf - Daniel Chopra languishes at 49th position
 Jyoti Randhawa now eight-under 134 New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa shot his second straight round of 67 to climb to tied-third position at the midway stage of the $ 500,000 Volvo Masters of Asia being played at the par-71 Bangkok Golf Club. Randhawas tournament tally stands at eight-under 134 in the season ending event on the 2003 Asian PGA Tour. According to information received here, American Ted Purdy continued to lead with a five-under 66, following close on the heels of his course record-breaking opening round 62. Purdys tournament aggregate of 14-under 128 was five strokes clear of second placed Austalian Unoh Parks tally of 133. Arjun Atwal, who created history Monday by becoming the first Indian to qualify for the US PGA Tour, shot a two-over 73 to slip to tie d-55th place at two-over 144. He was accompanied at that total by another Indian Arjun Singh. Amandeep Johl shot his second successive round of 69 for the tied-22nd position at 138, while his fellow Chandigarh pro Harmeet Kahlon was tied-28th at 139. Atwals arch rival for the Order of Merit title, Chinas Zhang Lian Wei shot a 69 to tie-32nd at 140, while Atwals fellow US PGA Tour qualifier Daniel Chopra occupied the tied-49th position at 141. Randhawa started the day in style, with a birdie on his opening hole, and went on to birdie the third and sixth but a bogey on the eighth saw him make the turn at two-under. Thereafter the 2002 APGA Order of Merit winner birdied the tenth, 12th, 16th and 18th and but for a double bogey on the 13th, would have occupied the sole second position. I must control this trend of messing up one hole, which prevents me from getting where I deserve to be, said the 31-year old Randhawa. Amandeep Johl, meanwhile, had a simple outward journey with a birdie on the eighth and a bogey on the following hole. On his back-nine, Johl birdied the 12th, 13th and 17th and dropped his second shot of the day on the 15th for his 69. Kahlon birdied three holes to finish with a 70, while Delhis Arjun Singh returned two bogeys more to finish round-two at 73. Atwal fired birdies on the first, third and fourth, but bogeys on the seventh and ninth preceded by a double bogey on the sixth pushed him against the wall. He, however, made up with three more birdies on the 11th, 15th and 17th and looked good for an under-par score before a disastrous four-over on the par-five 18th handed him a card of 73.

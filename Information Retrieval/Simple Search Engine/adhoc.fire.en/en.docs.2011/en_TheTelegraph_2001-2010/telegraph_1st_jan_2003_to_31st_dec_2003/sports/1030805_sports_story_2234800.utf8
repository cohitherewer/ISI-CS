 Sandeep Patil hails India A showing
 - Most players likely for conditioning camp  Coach Patil says bowling out SA was a great effort Mumbai: The India A team returned from its tour of England on Monday. Captain Shiv Sundar Das, Wasim Jaffer and Murali Kartik did not return with the rest of the team to complete their stints with minor counties. It is learnt that most of the players from the tour are likely to be selected for the conditioning camp ahead of the series against New Zealand. The selectors meet in Mumbai Tuesday to select the 25 probables. The camp is scheduled to begin in Bangalore later this month. The tour was very fruitful and the boys bowled out the strong South African team  which thrashed England by an innings and 92 runs in the second Test yesterday  quite cheaply in a three-day match at Arundel, coach Sandeep Patil said. We won five of the 11 matches we played while six were drawn and that proves the performance of the boys who have gained tremendously in confidence, he said. All the guidelines put forward by the national selectors were achieved during the tour. Showering praise on the youngsters, Patil, who guided Kenya to the World Cup semi-finals earlier this year, said: The frontline batsmen were among the runs and I should have a special word of praise for the seamers who bowled their heart out on flat pitches. Jaffer, who hit a double century in the last match against Warwickshire, S. Sriram, who missed the first six matches with a wrist fracture, Gautam Gambhir, skipper Shiv Sundar, his deputy Hemang Badani all contributed immensely to the teams success, Patil said. Patil said only Vijay Bharadwaj and Satyajit Parab could not give of their best as the former broke his finger during the middle of the tour while Parab was out of form. The coach was impressed by the commitment of his wards and sounded confident that some of the players would do well in the senior team. I was so impressed with their commitment that I would love to work with the same boys for the next two years though some of them will definitely do well in the senior team as well, Patil said. Wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel said he had achieved all his goals set for the tour. Whatever goals I had set for myself have been achieved on this tour and it was big success for all the members, he said. I am more confident as a batsman as I got runs in crucial matches and my performance behind the stumps too was satisfactory.  Laxman certain The Indian selectors will hardly need to put their thinking caps on to name the 25 probables for the conditioning camp for the New Zealand series. Besides the members of the World Cup squad, most of the players from India As tour of England are expected to be called. V. V. S. Laxman, who was dropped from the World Cup squad, is also almost certain to be selected for the camp which will see the players interacting with the new physical trainer Gregory Allen King for the first time.

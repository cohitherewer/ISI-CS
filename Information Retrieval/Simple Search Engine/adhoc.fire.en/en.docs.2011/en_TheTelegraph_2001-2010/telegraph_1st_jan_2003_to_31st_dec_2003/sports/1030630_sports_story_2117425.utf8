 Sehwag cracks 121 n.o.
London: Virender Sehwag cracked an unbeaten century to help Leicestershire consolidate their position in a four-day County match against Nottinghamshire at Grace Road Saturday. Sehwag, who opened the innings, was unbeaten on 121 off 122 balls at close of play. It was a characteristically aggressive knock by the India opener, and his innings was studded with 23 fours. Sehwags belligerence saw Leicestershire reach 159 for two in reply to Nottinghamshires first innings knock of 326. The other two Indian stars  Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif  failed to click. Yuvraj, playing for Yorkshire against Somerset in Taunton, continued with his uneven patch scoring only five. However, a brilliant unbeaten 183 by M.J. Wood and his 165-run stand with Stephen Fleming (98) propelled Yorkshire to a fscore of 362 for six in reply to Somersets 275. In the Northamptonshire vs Derbyshire four-day clash, Kaif was dismissed for 28 after a laboured 54-ball as Derbyshire were skittled out for 160. (PTI)  Copyright

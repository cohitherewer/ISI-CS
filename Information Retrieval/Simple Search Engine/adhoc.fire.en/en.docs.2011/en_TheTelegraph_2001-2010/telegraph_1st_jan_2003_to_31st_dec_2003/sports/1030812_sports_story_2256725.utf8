 Roddick eases to title
 Roddick with the trophy Montreal: Andy Roddick captured the biggest title of his career with a 6-1, 6-3 win over Argentine David Nalbandian in the rain-interrupted final of the Montreal Masters on Sunday. The sixth seeded American cruised to his fourth tournament victory of the season and first Masters crown with a fair amount of assistance from his unseeded opponent, who committed 27 unforced errors. Its my biggest title so far and hopefully it will be a good stepping stone to the Open, said Roddick, who remained fifth in the ATP Champions Race but moved to within eight points of third-placed Andre Agassi. Nalbandian got a break point in the opening game of the first set but Roddicks trademark cannon serve saved it. The 20-year-old American then broke Nalbandian twice. In the second set, the players swapped breaks on unforced errors, but Roddick broke the 21 year-old Argentine twice more to win the $2.45 million tournament a year after losing in the final to Guillermo Canas. He didnt have to do many things today. I couldnt play my game, Nalbandian said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

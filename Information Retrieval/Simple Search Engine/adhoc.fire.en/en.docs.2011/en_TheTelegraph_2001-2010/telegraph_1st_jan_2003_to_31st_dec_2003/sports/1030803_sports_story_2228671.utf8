 Viswanath much better than Gavaskar: Lillee
Sydney, Aug. 2 (PTI): Dennis Lillee does not think Sunil Gavaskar had much quality and rates Gundappa Viswanath as the best batsman who played against Australia. I know he was a great batsman but I cannot rate him among the great batsmen I bowled against, says Lillee in his autobiography. I rated Gavaskar of medium quality only and I have not changed my mind. Lillee instead gives the pride of place to the stylish Viswanath, Gavaskars brother-in-law. Viswanath was the best batsman against Australia who made runs against us and regularly at that. Both Gavaskar and Viswanath enjoyed a very good average against Australia. Viswanath averaged 53.03 from 18 matches, scoring 1538 runs with four centuries. Gavaskar scored 1550 runs at 51.66 with eight tons in 20 matches. And when it comes to current batsmen, Lillee has no hesitation in putting Sachin Tendulkar at the top of the list. He will be the first batsman in history to score a century of centuries in Test and ODIs, predicts Lillee.  Copyright

 Gooch returns to action 
Manchester: Former England captain Graham Gooch, who will be 50 in two months time, was pressed into emergency action as a substitute fielder for Essex against Lancashire at Old Trafford on Thursday. Gooch was on the field for seven overs, showing his team the way with an impressive stint at short midwicket to spinners James Middlebrook and Paul Grayson. (AFP)  Copyright

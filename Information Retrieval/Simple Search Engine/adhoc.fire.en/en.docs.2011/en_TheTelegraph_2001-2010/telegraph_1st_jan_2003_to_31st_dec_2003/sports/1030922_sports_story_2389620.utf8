The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Becks marriage on the rocks?
London: The fairytale marriage of England soccer captain David Beckham and his popstar wife Victoria has hit trouble but a split is not imminent, a tabloid claimed on Sunday. Quoting a friend, the News of the World stated: There are real tensions in the marriage for the first time. The family hopes they can be resolved before it gets out of control. According to the report, in calls to friends, Beckham has confided his fears over the simmering differences with his wife. He told one mate: I love her more than anything but things are ropey at the moment. Its as if at times we are leading separate lives. Beckham is fed up that Posh is not with him more as he makes his new life in Spain. She spends on an average just two days a week at his side. He is lonely as he spends solitary nights in his five-star hotel. He is distraught that he cannot see more of the sons he dotes on, Brooklyn and Romeo. According to the report, the friend said: There are pressures and David is feeling it hard because it is the first time there have been the slightest differences between him and Victoria. But a split is not imminent. While Beckham wows the fans at new club Real Madrid, Posh is resisting moving to Spain to join him full time. Her trips to New York to record a new album have caused more friction. Im so lonely, Becks told his mate. Its very difficult trying to speak to her because of the time differences. I dont know why she needs to be away that often. I dont know what to do. It puts me in an awkward situation. Im worried about the boys. I know our parents help all the time but all that travelling must tire them out. Friends say the 28-year-old Beckham is insisting that the family set up a home in Madrid, Victoria, 29, is equally keen to stay in England. We werent always in Manchester with you, she is said to have told him.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

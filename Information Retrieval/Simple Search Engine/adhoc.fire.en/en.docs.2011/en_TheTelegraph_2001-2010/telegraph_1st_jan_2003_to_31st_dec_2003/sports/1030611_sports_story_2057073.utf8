The Telegraph - Calcutta
 David Beckham is not Manchesters forever-man
Meet the England captain on holiday Despite what people say about me and Sir Alex Ferguson, hes been a father figure for me  FROM GRAHAME L. JONES IN CARSON generation over: Beckham has hinted he could be ready for a move from Old Trafford  David Beckham is taking it easy, on holiday, kicking back. Sprawled in a chair at the Los Angeles Galaxys new stadium here this past weekend, international soccers most engagingly complex personality and highest-paid player is unwinding.The stress of another dogfight of a season with Manchester United is ebbing away. Englands captain is wearing white sneakers, a pair of baggy blue jeans  the kind with all sorts of pockets and straps and doodads  a white T-shirt and a giant silver watch that almost dwarfs his left wrist.The topic is the United States, a country Beckham enjoys and, indeed, admires. Four of the reasons why are seated alongside him, starry-eyed to varying degrees and very much hanging on to his every word. They are Joy Fawcett, Kristine Lilly, Shannon MacMillan and Aly Wagner, the past, present and future of the world champion US womens national team.Beckham is warming to his theme.Youd never get 100,000 fans turning up for a womens football game in England, he says. Youd never get that. Its just amazing that can happen in America. It doesnt happen anywhere else in the world.Because Beckham, 28, was only a teenager in 1991 when Fawcett and Lilly helped the US win their first world championship, was he even aware of the China 91 tournament?Fawcett and Lilly cringe. Were old ladies, they cry out, laughing.Yeah, of course, says Beckham. Im a football fan. Whether its English football or European football or world football or womens football, it doesnt matter. I was aware of it going on, but obviously being in England you didnt see much of it.And is he really a fan of the womens game? Of course I support it, and not just because theyre sat here, he answers, nodding his head in the direction of the US players. Ive always said that I support womens football.People have asked me what Ill do when I finish playing. People always expect you to go into coaching or management. For me, I just want to have soccer schools, for boys and girls. Every time Ive said that, people have always turned around to me and said, Girls and women? Why? But I think its important that everyone enjoys the sport, not just men. They think its a macho sport. Its not. Womens football in England and in Europe will never get the support that its got in America. Its going to be hard. Its never going to be as big as it is over here. It could be. It could be. Id love it to be. Lilly interrupts. Its taken us a long time too, she says. Yes, but youve taken it to a level that hopefully we can get it to, Beckham says. Its a level that women over in England would dream of. As I said, Id love it to happen. So who do you pick to win the Womens World Cup? Wagner asks. You, Beckham replies, meaning the US. Youre the strongest team. Wagner cant resist taking it a step further. Is the San Diego Spirit your favourite WUSA team? she asks. Of course it is, Beckham answers with a grin. He is relaxed, at ease, enjoying himself. In Europe, things are far, far different. Beckham and his wife, former Spice Girl Victoria, and their two children, Brooklyn and Romeo, had no sooner left England and headed to America on vacation when the rumours began curving across the continent like Beckham free-kicks. First it was AC Milan, the new European champion owned by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, that allegedly was intent on luring the family to Italys fashion capital. That was a couple of weeks ago, but the rumour was quickly scotched by Adriano Galliani, an AC Milan vice-president, who said that the asking price was too high. To see him in Milan is impossible, Galliani told the Corriere della Sera newspaper. It takes a lot of money, too much money. In any case, there is a conflict. Beckham has a sponsorship contract with one telephone company. AC Milan is sponsored by a rival. So much for Milan. Then it was Barcelonas turn. The Spanish club is in the midst of a presidential election set for this Sunday. One of the six candidates, Joan Laporta, has promised to bring Beckham to Nou Camp if elected. He has talked to Manchester United and offered in the neighbourhood of $50 million for Beckham. Never mind that Barcelona already is $269 million in debt. I view this as a great price for Beckham, Laporta told the Sunday Express.Radomir Antic, Barcelonas coach, has ridiculed the rumours. So far they are rumours and nothing else, he said.But last week Uniteds chief executive, Peter Kenyon, who has called Beckham the most recognised footballer in the world, perhaps the most recognised person, said Manchester might be tempted by a $50 million offer. And Beckham? What does he make of all this? These rumours have been going on for two months now, he says. About a month ago, it was Real Madrid and now its Barcelona. But Im a Manchester United player. Im contracted to them for another two or three years, I think. As long as they want me, then Ill stay. But Ive never said that Id never move away from Manchester, and Ive never said that Id end my career there. One reason the British press, in particular, believes that Manchester will part with its highest-profile asset is the medias conviction that United coach Alex Ferguson and Beckham do not see eye to eye. Or boot to forehead, for that matter. The generation and lifestyle gaps yawn wide. Beckham dismisses such notions. Despite what people say about me and Sir Alex Ferguson, hes been a father figure for me, he says.Ive been at Manchester United for like 12 years now and without him I wouldnt be the player or the person that I am today, because he had the confidence when I was 18 years old to put me in the first team and a number of other young players in the first team.When he was in South Africa last month, Beckham met Nelson Mandela. It is difficult to tell who was more impressed by whom. The next day, Beckham broke his wrist during Englands a 2-1 victory over South Africa in Durban. His right arm is in a cast from wrist to elbow. Its a lot better, he says. I think I should get this off in a week. I had the operation so I could be back for the tour. So they just put a pin in it.Manchester United has a four-game tour of the United States set for next month.Lilly isnt interested in the cast or the tour. Its the inside of Beckhams left forearm that intrigues her, specifically the bold tattoo. She asks what it means. Thats Victoria in Hindi, Beckham replies. And thats So that I may love and cherish.Why in Hindi? Lilly asks. I just like the writing, Beckham says. Wagner takes off in a different direction, in pursuit of the Mohawk, the shaven head, the braided cornrows, the ever-changing hairdo that is the fashion-conscious Beckhams look. Do you pick your styles or does your stylist do it? she asks. No, I do it, says Beckham. I dont have a stylist. The only time Ill have a hairdresser is when Im doing a shoot or a magazine or something like that. But with the hairstyle its not something I plan. Ill just sometimes wake up in the morning and think, Im bored with my hair. The balding reporter can only nod and sigh. LAT-WP  Copyright

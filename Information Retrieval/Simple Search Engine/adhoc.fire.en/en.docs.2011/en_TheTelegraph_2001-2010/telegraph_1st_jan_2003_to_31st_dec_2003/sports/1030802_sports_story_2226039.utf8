 Boards no to Kaif, Yuvraj
 Yuvraj (top) amp;  Kaif New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has denied batsmen Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh permission to play in a charity match in memory of the late England player Ben Hollioake, who died in a car accident last year. Kaif and Yuvraj were invited to play but we asked them not to participate because we normally dont encourage these types of games, a BCCI official, who did not wish to be identified, said on Friday. There are several benefit matches for Indian players pending and so its not logical for them to be playing away from their country in a charity game. ICC rules state that players need permission from their respective boards to play in such charity matches. Kaif and Yuvraj, who play for Derbyshire and Yorkshire respectively could have joined players from Pakistan in an Asia versus Rest of the World game in Arundel on August 9 for the Ben Hollioake Memorial Trust.

 NZC no to Fleming 
Auckland: Injured captain Stephen Fleming will not be considered for his teams one-day series in Pakistan, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said on Wednesday. Fleming was hoping to rejoin the side for their arrival in Lahore on November 27 but the abdominal injury that forced him to miss the final tri-series match against India last week will not heal in time. NZC doctor Rob Campbell and medical co-ordinator Warren Frost examined Fleming on Wednesday, after he arrived back from Mumbai with the four players (Craig McMillan, Scott Styris, Ian Butler and Lou Vincent) who opted out of the Pakistan tour. Stephen requires physiotherapy treatment and rest over the next three weeks to help ensure he is fit for Pakistans tour of New Zealand next month, Frost told reporters. The tour to Pakistan was finally rubber-stamped by NZC on Tuesday after New Zealand had received a threatening e-mail from unknown sources advising them not to play during the holy month of Ramazan. Investigators have drawn up a sketch of a man suspected of sending the e-mail that threatened the New Zealand team, an official said, adds a reports from Lahore. The sketch is based on descriptions of the man given by the owner of an internet cafe from where the e-mail was purportedly sent. The cafe owner was taken into police custody on Monday. He is being held for questioning and has not been charged with any offence.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

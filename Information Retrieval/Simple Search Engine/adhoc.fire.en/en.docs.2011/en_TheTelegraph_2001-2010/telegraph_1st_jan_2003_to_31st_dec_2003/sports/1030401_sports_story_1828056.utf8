The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gilchrists big thrill
 Steve: No place for complacency Melbourne: Australias Test captain Steve Waugh will shake any hint of complacency from the team on the forthcoming four-Test tour of the West Indies, Adam Gilchrist said on Monday. Test cricket, its a new challenge and obviously a different captain in charge, Gilchrist said in an interview on Australian television as the Test squad prepared to fly out of Sydney for the Caribbean on Monday. That captain in Steve Waugh obviously doesnt take to being complacent very well. Hell be demanding the best from us. Its a big thrill for all of us to know that hes committed to play on, added Gilchrist in a reference to the decision announced by 37-year-old Steve earlier this month. Steve said on Monday that motivation would not be a problem for the weary Australians because Test cricket was special. The accolades and glory will last for quite a while longer for the deserving members of the World Cup squad, said Steve, who captained Australia to victory in the 1999 final against Pakistan. But they all know that their places in the Test team are closely contested and any sign of complacency will end in the results not being what they should be, he added in a Herald Sun column. We are the benchmark for other teams to aspire to, due largely to a thing called professionalism which is what we all pride ourselves on. Steve also said that Australias demotion to number two on the ICC Test rankings would serve as extra motivation. Australia are ranked second to South Africa in the ICC Test championship. Unless we win this series we will remain the number two side so there is a lot to play for, Steve said. Ive thought about it a few times. I know the other guys probably havent as yet but once we get over to the West Indies that will be one of the motivating factors. People expect us just to turn up and beat the West Indies  it is not going to be the case. It is a tough tour to be on, but enjoyable.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

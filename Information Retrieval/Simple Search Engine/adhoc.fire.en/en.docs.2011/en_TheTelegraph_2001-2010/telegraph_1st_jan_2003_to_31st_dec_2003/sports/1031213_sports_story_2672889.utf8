 Court upholds Kale suspension
Pune: In a setback to Abhijit Kale, the additional sessions judge B. N. Deshpande on Thursday upheld his suspension by the BCCI. In view of this order, Kale will not be able to play any match as the BCCI appeal against the lower court order, which had stayed the suspension order, has been set aside. (PTI)  Copyright

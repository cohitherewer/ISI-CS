The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hayden fells Laras record
 - WACA ground sees Australian opener's rise to immortality  off a 437-delivery innings
 Adam Gilchrist after  his century on Friday Perth: Australia batsman Matthew Hayden wiped Brian Laras record of highest individual score in a Test innings with a spectacular 380 on the second day of the first Test against Zimbabwe on Friday. Haydens mammoth effort beat the previous mark of 375 set by Lara against England in 1994. The Queenslander pushed left-arm slow bowler Ray Price for a single to long on in the last over before tea to reach 376 before swinging his bat above his head in celebration and raising both hands to the cheers of the crowd. Hayden then kissed his Baggy Green and was bear-hugged by teammate Adam Gilchrist.Hayden was finally caught at deep square leg by Stuart Carlisle off Trevor Gripper shortly after tea. Australia declared on 735 for six immediately after Haydens dismissal with Gilchrist unbeaten on 113. Hayden struck 38 fours and 11 sixes from 437 balls in 622 minutes at the crease. Each member of the Zimbabwe team also congratulated Hayden as he walked from the field at tea on 376 not out. The 31-year-old had resumed on his overnight score of 183 after blazing 107 in the evening session on Thursday. The powerfully-built left hander reached his 300 with a single to mid-off off Heath Streak. Hayden took a single to long-off to reach 335, passing the previous Australia record of 334 shared by former captain Mark Taylor and the great Don Bradman. Dropped at long-on on 335, Hayden then smashed his 10th six as wicketkeeper Gilchrist slipped almost unnoticed into the nineties. Hayden shared partnerships of 97 with Damien Martyn (53), 207 with captain Steve Waugh (78) and 96 with Darren Lehmann (30) plus 233 with Gilchrist. Gilchrists hundred, his ninth in 46 matches, was also a powerful knock but was completely overshadowed by Haydens heroics. But Zimbabwe began their reply well and were 79 for one at stumps, 656 runs behind Australias daunting total  (REUTERS)  Copyright

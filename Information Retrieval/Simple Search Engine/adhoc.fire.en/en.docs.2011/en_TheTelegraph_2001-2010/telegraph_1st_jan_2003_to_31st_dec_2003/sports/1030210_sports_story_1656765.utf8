 United, Arsenal drop points 
 Juventus David Trezeguet (No. 17) and Pavel Nedved (bottom) collide with Empoli goalkeeper Gianluca Berti and Manuel Belleri in Turin on Saturday. Juventus won 1-0. (AFP) Manchester: A perfect header from substitute Shaun Goater three minutes from time earned Manchester City a 1-1 Premier League draw to cost Manchester United the chance of going joint top on Sunday. Meanwhile, Frenchman Laurent Robert powered Newcastles equaliser to hold leaders Arsenal to a 1-1 draw at home. Sylvain Wiltord slipped a perfectly-weighted through ball to his French team mate Thierry Henry and the leagues leading scorer converted expertly. It was Henrys 18th league goal of the season. After the break, Newcastle upped their work rate and levelled the score when Robert collected the ball in the middle of the Arsenal half, shrugged off two challenges and struck left footed into the corner of the net after 53 minutes. Meanwhile, Ruud van Nistelrooys 18th-minute strike put United ahead against their city rivals. But a neat chip from Shaun Wright-Phillips set up Goater to bury a firm header into the top corner to level things up. United took the lead when captain Roy Keane threaded a through ball to Ryan Giggs on the right and his pacey low cross was guided home at an angle for Van Nistelrooys 12th league goal of the season and 63rd in 84 games for United. Juventus win Meanwhile, Italian champions Juventus kept up the pressure on AC Milan and Inter Milan at the top of Serie A with a 1-0 win over Empoli in Turin on Saturday.

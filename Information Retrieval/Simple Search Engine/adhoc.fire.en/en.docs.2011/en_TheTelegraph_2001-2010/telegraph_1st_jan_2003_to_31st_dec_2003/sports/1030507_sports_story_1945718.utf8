The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kluivert no to United move 
 Kluivert was tipped by Van Nistelrooy as perfect strike partner for the English champions Barcelona: Barcelonas Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert has been linked to a move to English champions Manchester United. Kluivert has been targeted for abuse by some sections of the Nou Camp crowd and international teammate Ruud van Nistelrooy has said the 26-year-old would be his perfect strike partner at Manchester. Manchester chief executive Peter Kenyon has promised summer additions to manager Alex Fergusons squad. Kluivert, however, says he will not be one of them. These rumours are completely unfounded. Ive always said that I want to stay here, Kluivert told the Barcelona club website. Im getting a bit tired of saying that I want to stay here, said the striker, who recently equalled Dennis Bergkamps record of 37 goals for Holland in a 1-1 draw with Portugal. However, Kluiverts future at the club could be decided on May 15 when Barcelona have to take up an option to reduce his salary in return for a reduction in the players buy-out clause. His contract does not expire until 2005 but the clause allows Barcelona to halve his annual salary, reportedly six million euros. In return, Kluiverts transfer fee would be slashed from $36 million to $1.8 million, smoothing the way for him to negotiate better terms with a new club. Kluivert said no one from Barcelona had spoken to him about his future. The deadline is on May 15, so lets see what happens before then. If I need to speak to one of the directors, Ill do so, he said. Barcelona are currently in the process of electing a new board, which is likely to delay any decision on Kluiverts future. Kluivert stressed the importance of the support he has received from the squad at a time when he has been under a lot of pressure because of his goal drought and the rumours about his future. The most important thing is that the players are with me, he said. But he was unhappy with his treatment by the fans. I dont understand why some people make such an effort to get at you, he said.

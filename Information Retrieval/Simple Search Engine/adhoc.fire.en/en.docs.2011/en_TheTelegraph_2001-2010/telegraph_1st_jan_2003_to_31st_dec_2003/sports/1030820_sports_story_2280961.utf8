The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Srinath rehab on home turf
 - Im not looking beyond getting the knee into shape  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Srinath is in regular touch with UK-based specialist Bangalore: Jawagal Srinath has neither gone to England, nor has he decided on continuing/retiring as the Team India spearhead. Rather, he is very much in hometown Mysore, religiously following the rehab programme for a troublesome right knee. Its a slow process... Surgery is definitely an option but, at this stage in my career, I need to have a very close look at everything before deciding one way or the other, Srinath told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon, when contacted on his cellphone. Srinath, it may be recalled, wasnt available for the Dhaka tri-series (soon after the World Cup) and requested not to be picked among the 36 probables for the pre-season conditioning camp here. A fortnight ago, he sought two-three weeks time to take a decision  clearly, he needs more than that. Look, till the knee improves, Im not in a position to say anything...Indeed, how can I? If I do undergo surgery, Ill be off for a long time. Then, if I stick to the conservative method of treatment, essentially being particular with the rehab exercises, I must actually be patient, Srinath, who underwent shoulder surgery in 1997, pointed out. In the World Cup, of course, Srinath was firm about having very little cricket left. But, then, severing a 12-year relationship isnt ever easy. Currently, within the veteran, theres a struggle. Srinath, by the way, has 236 wickets in 67 Tests and 315 from 229 ODIs. Asked whether his short stint with Durham (at the start of the summer) did the damage, he replied: Though I only played a few matches, perhaps, there was some aggravation... Basically, Ive had a niggle for quite some time and, after so much wear and tear, one has to accept such injuries... Srinath confirmed being in regular touch with a UK-based specialist. He hasnt, however, been keeping Team India physio Andrew Leipus posted. Meanwhile, Srinath clarified he hasnt signed a contract with the Centurion-headquartered Gauteng province for the up-coming season. They sought my availability (for playing and doubling-up as bowling coach) and I responded by saying Im in no position to accept or reject their offer... Today, Im not looking beyond getting the knee into shape. Signing off, Srinath informed he may make a trip to Bangalore over the next few days. If he does come over, it will provide the John Wrights an excellent opportunity for a one-on-one with somebody who still has it in him to deliver. But, then, he has to be fit. Srinath turns 34 on August 31.  Copyright

 Teams not to be docked overs from April 1
Johannesburg: Teams fielding first will no longer be docked overs for slow bowling rate in one-day Internationals as the ICC has decided to amend rules and introduce heavy fines. The new system will come into effect from April 1 and according to Dave Richardson, general manager of ICC, the change was made after the sports governing body reached the conclusion that the existing system was faulty. Now teams bowling first will also attract heavy fines for slow over rate, just as teams fielding second do. The first tournament to adopt the new rule will be the three-nation Sharjah Cup featuring South Africa, Sri Lanka and Pakistan in April 1 to 10. South Africa were penalised one over against the West Indies in the World Cup opener on February 9, which proved costly as they lost by three runs.  (PTI)  Copyright

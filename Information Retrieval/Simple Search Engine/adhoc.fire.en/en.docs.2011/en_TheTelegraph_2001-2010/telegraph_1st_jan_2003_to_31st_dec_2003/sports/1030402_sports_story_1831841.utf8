 NCA recruit base set for expansion
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The National Cricket Academy is all set for an expansion from this season. The academy, which used to run on an under-19 format hitherto, will start its under-15 and 17 wings.  According to a top Board of Control for Cricket in India functionary, the move has been taken keeping in mind the formation of a proper pipeline for a steady supply of talented youngsters. We want the best boys to be groomed at the academy from a junior stage, as is done in countries like Australia, the BCCI official added. However, he informed that these wings would not start in the regional academies right now. We are intending to get the top 20 boys from each category to stay at the academy in Bangalore while the regional wings of the under-19 sector are on, the official added. It will be a two-month programme where the boys will go through the rigours. He also informed that the boys would be chosen on April 8. According to the board functionary, the national selectors would be present at the meeting. The coaches for the regional academies will also be decided on that day in the meeting, where chief Technical Research Development Officer Dilip Vengsarkar will be present.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Now, 2-yr contract for Leipus
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Leipus Calcutta: Team India physio Andrew Leipus, on annual contracts ever since he joined in October 1999, has now been offered a two-year deal  with retrospective effect, from April 1  by the hassled Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The last contract, it may be recalled, ended with the World Cup. Obviously, the BCCI has woken up after Adrian le Rouxs stinging decision to stay back in South Africa and work with Graeme Smith and Co. Leipus, then, is a (richly deserving) beneficiary of the Le Roux fallout. After all, till the physical trainer chose to part ways, the physio was slotted for a one-year extension only. According to The Telegraphs sources, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya personally extended the fresh offer during a Calcutta-Johannesburg hook-up, Tuesday. Some fine-tuning remains, otherwise approval by the working committee, which is mandatory, is a mere formality, is how one source put it. That fine-tuning should be done later this month itself, when Leipus will be in Bangalore conducting two four-day seminars for the physios and trainers of zonal establishments under the National Cricket Academy umbrella. Though an Australian citizen, the Team India physio has been South Africa-based for some years. Meanwhile, the process of identifying Le Rouxs successor has gained momentum with the former trainer himself suggesting a fellow-South African (currently with a provincial side) to coach John Wright. Wright, in turn, has forwarded that gentlemans CV to Dalmiya. If his credentials are actually good, the BCCI should call him for an interview. However, that exercise will only be possible after the forthcoming Asian Cricket Council and International Cricket Council meetings in London, where Dalmiya has to be present. Today, the mood within the BCCI is to quickly get a replacement, emphasised another source, Wednesday. Well, the BCCIs response to this crisis, at least, has been praiseworthy.  Copyright

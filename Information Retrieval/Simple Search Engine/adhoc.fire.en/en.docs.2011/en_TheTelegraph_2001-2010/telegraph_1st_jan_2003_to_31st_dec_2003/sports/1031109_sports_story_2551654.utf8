 Mahesh-Max in easier group
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Nov. 8: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi find themselves in the easier group at the season-ending Masters Doubles championship. As per the draw conducted in Houston on Friday, the second-seeded Bhupathi and Mirnyi have been clubbed with Mark Knowles-Daniel Nestor (No. 4), Wayne Arthurs-Paul Hanley (5) and Gaston Etlis-Martin Rodriguez (8). The other group is made up of Mike and Bob Bryan (1), Jonas Bjorkman-Todd Woodbridge (3), Mikael Llodra-Fabrice Santoro (6) and Martin Damm-Cyril Suk (7). The top two teams from each group will qualify for the semis. Bhupathi and Mirnyi kick off against the lowest-rated Argentine pair of Etlis and Rodriguez, who replaced Leander Paes and David Rikl in the eight-team field. The year-ending No. 1 team ranking is at stake, with Bhupathi-Mirnyi in hot pursuit of the Bryan twins. The Indo-Belarussian pair has 878 points, just 24 less than the American duo.  Copyright

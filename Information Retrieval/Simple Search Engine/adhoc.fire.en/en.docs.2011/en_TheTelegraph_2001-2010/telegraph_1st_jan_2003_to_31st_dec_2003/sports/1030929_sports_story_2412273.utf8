The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Karachi likely to be the new venue 
Islamabad: In an apparent bid to pacify protests over the omission of Karachi as venue for the forthcoming series against South Africa, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was planning to shift the Asian Cricket Councils under-19 tournament to the eastern port city. The PCB, to pacify the growing protests over omission of Karachi as an international cricket centre due to prevailing violence, may shift the ACCs under-19 tournament from Lahore to Karachi, local daily The News said. Cricket lovers of Karachi, the biggest Pakistan city, protested after PCB shifted the venues for the South African series from Karachi and Peshawar in order to convince the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) to reverse its decision to cancel the tour. The ACC under-19 meet, which was originally to be held from November 1-7 involving India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh alongside hosts Pakistan, is now rescheduled from October 30 to November 6 and the PCB wants it to be held at various centres in Karachi. The chief attraction of the meet will be an Indian teams participation on Pakistan soil after nearly five years. An India A team under Gagan Khodas captaincy, toured Pakistan in 1998.

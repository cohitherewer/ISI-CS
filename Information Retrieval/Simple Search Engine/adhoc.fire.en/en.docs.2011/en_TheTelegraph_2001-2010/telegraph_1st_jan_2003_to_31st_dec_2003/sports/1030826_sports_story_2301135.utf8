 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Chandigarh: Two of the five women cricketers who went missing in the United Kingdom earlier this month have reportedly joined the team. A senior intelligence officer here said the agent who had arranged the trip, Ravi Sharma, informed the Jalandhar police that Rajwant Kaur and Pravesh Rani had returned to the team. We are investigating Sharmas claim. He has been calling up the offices of various dailies in Jalandhar since yesterday and giving all sorts of statements in his favour. The media too is lapping it up, the officer added. According to Sharma, Baljeet Kaur, Mandeep Virk and Ekta Andotra had also contacted him. He has claimed that they too would return within a couple of days. The parents of the girls who have reportedly returned could not be contacted till late in the evening.  Copyright

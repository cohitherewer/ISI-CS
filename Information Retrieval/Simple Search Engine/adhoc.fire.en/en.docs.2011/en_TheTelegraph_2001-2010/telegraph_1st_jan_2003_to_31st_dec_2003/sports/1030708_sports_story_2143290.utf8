		 Tuesday, July 08, 2003  Fourth German Derby for Schutz 
				 										Hamburg (Reuters): Andreas Schutz saddled his fourth German Derby success with French-ridden Dai Jin on Sunday while Godolphins hopes of a 100th Group One win ended in tatters with New South Wales finishing last.				 										Olivier Pesliers mount, 9-2 second favourite, came home a length and a quarter in front of second-placed Ransom OWar, a 10-1 outsider. It was the Frenchmans second German Derby success after winning with Borgia in 1997. 				 										The 7-2 favourite New South Wales, ridden by Frankie Dettori, got into trouble before the final turn and could only bring up the rear of the 20-strong field.				 										Godolphin, the brainchild of Sheik Mohammed of Dubai, was hoping for its 100th Group One win since the stable started up in the mid-1990s.				 										Since taking over the yard from his late father Bruno, Schutz has hit the jackpot three times. Schutzs three previous winner were Robertico in 1998, Samum (2000) and Next Desert last year. 				 										There is a familiar ring to his methods as he always enters a lot of horses and had five of the 20 runners this group one race for three-year-olds over one and a half miles.				 										But the quality is also undeniable. However, stable jockey, Andrasch Starke, choose to ride German Oaks winner Next Gina (5-1) who placed fouth. Schutz also claimed third and fifth spots with Storm Trooper (9-1) and Akihito (20-1).

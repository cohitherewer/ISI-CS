 Fredericks quits
 Fredericks finished with a silver in his last race Abuja: Two-time Olympic medallist Frankie Fredericks announced he was retiring from international athletics after losing a close-run 200 metres to Nigerian sprinter Uchenna Emedolu at the All Africa Games. Emedolu won in a time of 20.42s, one hundredth of a second ahead of Fredericks. This is my last international competition. I am happy to go with the silver. It is not a bad way to end a career, Fredericks said on Wednesday. I wanted to bow out with gold at the African Games but I reckon I had to run fast at the age of 36 to achieve it. Fredericks said he would turn his attention to organising coaching clinics. I will now go round Africa to share my experience with the young ones on how to improve. The 36-year-old has dominated the 100 and 200m on the African continent for more than a decade and was only denied the Olympic gold medal over the longer distance at the 1996 Atlanta Games by the world record run of Michael Johnson. Fredericks time of 19.68sec was an African world record but Johnsons incredible 19.32sec was impossible to beat. The popular Namibian had said at the world championships in Paris in August that he intended to compete in next years Athens Olympics, but he had a change of heart. (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Shoaib halts Bangla
 - Omars maiden century in vain as last 8 wkts fall for 51  A fiery Shoaib Akhtar took six for 50 Peshawar: Shoaib Akhtar snatched six wickets for 11 runs off 21 deliveries to wreck Bangladeshs chances of a huge total on the second day of the second cricket Test on Thursday. Shoaibs second career-best figures of six for 50 helped the home team dismiss Bangladesh for 361 and overshadowed opener Javed Omars career-best 119. At stumps Pakistan had reached 134 for two with opener Taufeeq Umer on 60 and Inzamam-ul Haq on 24. Pakistan lost opener Mohammed Hafeez and twin century maker of the first Test Yasir Hameed for 23 on a day highlighted by Shoaibs fiery performance. Shoaib, who used ice to keep cool in the oppressive heat, destroyed the Bangladesh middle and lower order with some hostile bowling as the tourists plummeted from a commanding 302 for two at lunch to lose their last eight wickets for 51 runs. Omar, who reached his maiden century in the fourth over of the day, was Shoaibs first victim, bowled by a full-length delivery, which triggered a familiar Bangladesh batting collapse. Bangladesh looked set to post a huge total once Omar and Mohammed Ashraful batted safely through the first session. But Shoaib, wicketless until lunch, bowled with a venom and fire that matched the weather conditions and changed the complexion of the match.  Umpire takes the heat Umpire Russell Tiffin suffered from the heat and was allowed to sit out the last session in the umpires room as Third Umpire Asad Rauf took over. Omars vigil lasted 357 balls and was spiced with 17 fours but Shoaib uprooted hios stumps with a thunderbolt. He then dismissed Ashraful who miscued a hook and spooned an easy catch. Ashraful hit seven boundaries and his stand with Omar created a new Bangladesh third wicket record of 130, easily eclipsing the stand of 84 between Aminul Islam and Omar against India in their inaugural Test in Dhaka three years ago.

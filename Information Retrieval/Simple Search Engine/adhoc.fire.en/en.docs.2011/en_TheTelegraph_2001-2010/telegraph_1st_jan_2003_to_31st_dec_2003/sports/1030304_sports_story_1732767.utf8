The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stewart wish
Port Elizabeth: Englands Alec Stewart has called for the last round of World Cup group matches to be played on the same day to avoid a repeat of the agonising wait his side face to see if they qualify for the Super Sixes. England have to wait until Tuesdays match between Zimbabwe and Pakistan to discover if they will progress. In a way the defeat to Australia hasnt affected us too much and Pakistan do know what they have to win by, but I believe the last round of matches should all be played on the same day at the same time, Stewart said. Thats what they do in soccer and in the last World Cup four years ago.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

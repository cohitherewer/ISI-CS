 HC blow to Bagan body
  BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: In a significant verdict, the Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the executive committee of Mohun Bagan club to keep away from matters related to football, and appointed a three-man committee to run the game.The division bench of Justice M.H.S. Ansari and Arun Mitra also ruled that McDowell amp; Company Limited can continue as sponsors but cant form a company with the club  something East Bengal did in association with Kingfisher when UB Group decided to fund the football teams of both clubs in 1998.Mohun Bagan members had moved court, following the ruling bodys decision to float a company in collaboration with the liquor giants. The ruling group had lost a case at the city civil court earlier before going to the high court. Even that move, however, proved futile.According to Fridays verdict, the Mohun Bagan executive committee will not be dissolved, but football activities will be looked after by the body comprising Umesh Banerjee, Shyamal Sen (former Governor of Bengal) and Indrajit Sen.Its yet to be known when the three-man body will take over and how it will function. Chances of the UB Group dissociating itself from Mohun Bagan cant also be ruled  Copyright

Negombo (Sri Lanka): Mary Ann Gomes drew her second-round game with J. Rajasuriya in the Asian junior chess championship here on Sunday. Mary Ann, who got off to a winning start, now has 1.5 points. Defending boys champion Deepan Chakravarthy maintained his clean slate when he got the better of fellow-Indian Himanshu Kumar. Other Indians to post victories were Magesh Chandran, P. Mokal, Poobesh Anand, Akshay Raj Kore and G. Rohit. Deep Sengupta suffered a shocking loss to Iranian Akrania Seyed Arash. Chandran outwitted compatriot Abhijit Gupta while Vietnams Nguyen Ngoc Truong Son continued to impress with an excellent end-game win over Indian Arun Prasad. The most impressive perfomance came from 13-year old Nguyen as he eked out a win from a drawish ending. WIM Dronavali Harika maintained her lead in girls event. Harika was involved in an interesting queen, rook and bishop ending with H. Nilavoli and came out with a stunning exchange sacrifice that did her fellow-Indian in. Y.

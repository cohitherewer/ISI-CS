 Pietermaritzburg: Chaminda Vaas claimed an extraordinary slice of history by taking a hattrick with the first three balls of the match as Sri Lanka crushed Bangladesh by ten wickets in a World Cup group B match Friday.Vaas, despite suffering from a sore back, then added a fourth victim in his opening over before finishing with figures of six for 25 from 9.1 overs.Bangladesh, who had lost the toss and ended the first over on 4 for five, were demolished for 124 in the 32nd over.Sanath Jayasuriya and Maravan Atapattu then scored run-a-ball half-centuries to cruise to their target in the 22nd over.No one had ever previously taken a hattrick with the first three balls of a first-class match.Vaas celebrated his feat running down the wicket with his arms outstretched, but otherwise remained poker-faced throughout, perhaps moved to pity by his opponents ineptitude.I had a sore back this morning... Im not really interested in records, I just want to stay fit, Vaas said.The match began with Bangladesh opener Hannan Sarkar attempting an expansive drive at Vaas first inswinger, only to be bowled through the gate. Mohammed Ashraful walked in, then straight back out again after chipping back a simple return catch, and Ehsanul Haque snicked the third ball to Mahela Jayawardene at second slip to spark Lankan jubilation.Left-arm swing bowler Vaas, who already has the best one-day International figures (eight for 19), saw his next ball chopped through the covers for four by Sanwar Hossain. A wide, swinging away outside off stump, followed before Hossain shuffled forward on his leg stump and was trapped lbw.The ball rolled back down the pitch to the 29-year-old Vaas, who flung the ball dismissively away with barely a smile.Bangladesh lost their opening World Cup match in humiliating fashion to minnows Canada. They have now suffered 27 defeats in their last 28 one-dayers, with the other game rained off.Vaas claimed his next victim when opener Al-Sahariar mis-timed drive looped high to Aravinda de Silva at mid-off.Fellow pace bowler Dilhara Fernando suffered by comparison as Bangladesh allrounder Alok Kapali, the one batsman to impress, hooked him for six.But Kapali (32), who looked solid during his 37-ball stint, chucked his wicket away playing a lose shot to cover off Fernando.Muttiah Muralidharan took the next three wickets before Vaas wrapped up the innings.In reply, Atapattu finished on 69 not out off 71 balls, while Jayasuriya made a 57-ball 55, with seven fours and a six.The day Vaas completed the world record, Zimbabwe were dismissed for 38, the lowest-ever one-day score. The only other World Cup hattricks came from Chetan Sharma and Saqlain Mushtaq.  Copyright

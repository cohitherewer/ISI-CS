 Windies plan remedy session
Port-of-Spain: Acknowledging there are problems with key players and emerging talent, the West Indies Cricket Board is looking to set up remedial training. The proposal from the senior selectors is that we should look at the 17 players for specific purposes  bring them together in one place and work on them, WICB chief development officer Michael Seepersad, said here on Wednesday. Details have yet to be worked out but he said training for the team, currently down 0-3 in the four-Test series against the touring Australians, would take place at the Shell Academy in Grenada. Captain and star batsman Brian Lara has said that his players, the youngest ever fielded by the West Indies with an average age just under 25, have been batting well but need to improve their bowling. Seepersad announced the newest batch of players entering the academy, including seven Jamaicans, five from Barbados, four Trinidadians, four Guyanese, three from the Windward Islands and two from the Leeward Islands. Academy director Rudi Webster urged participants to take advantage of the 12-week course that starts May 16. If I can change the way you think about yourselves, your abilities, teammates, your future, spiritual and social as well as your academic life by the end of the programme, I would be the happiest man around, he said. Aussie reinforcements Meanwhile, World Cup champions Australia will fly a quartet of one-day specialists including Michael Bevan to Antigua on Friday for the limited-overs series against the West Indies starting next week, says a report from Melbourne. Bevan will join allrounders Andrew Symonds and Ian Harvey and off-spinner Nathan Hauritz on flights to the West Indies via London, the ACB announced in a statement on Wednesday. Bevan has hit 5,807 runs at an average of 54.78 in 186 ODIs including six hundreds. The 32-year-old averages 29.07 with no centuries in his 18 Tests and has not played a Test for five years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
Bengal  Sachin still Cups numero uno
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sachin Tendulkar receives his trophy from Sir Gary Sobers Johannesburg: Sachin Tendulkar couldnt contribute in the one game all of India wanted him to, but still emerged Man of the Tournament in World Cup 2003. In fact, that was confirmed even before the first ball in Sundays final when the International Cricket Council clarified that he did get two points in the Durban semi-final (against Kenya). Those points took Sachins tally to an unassailable 14, four clear of his captain, Sourav Ganguly. As the Man of the Match earns three points, there was no way Sourav could have done better. The Match Referee, it may be recalled, awards points to the top three players in every game. While the MoM obviously gets the maximum of three points, No. 2 earns two, with the No. 3 player getting one point. Sachin, who received the 500,000 gold trophy from Sir Gary Sobers, finished the World Cup with 673 runs. Incidentally, very early in the tournament, he told The Telegraph that one player cannot make the biggest impact in what is a team sport. Actually, till the final, Sachin did have a huge presence. The last edition had seen Lance Klusener being adjudged No.1, even though South Africa didnt make the final.  Copyright

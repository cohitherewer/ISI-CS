A volley from striker Christian Vieri ensured Inter maintained their impressive home record with their eighth win in 10 games at the San Siro. Perugia striker Miccoli sunk Milan with a rocketing 25m strike in the 36th minute. Inter lead with 45 points from Milan and Juventus, who are tied on 42 points. Juventus beat Empoli 1-0 on Saturday. Lazio fell further off the pace after they were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Torino. Sociedad lead cut In Madrid, Real Sociedad saw their lead at the top of the table cut to just two points after the weekends matches as they were held to a 0-0 draw at home by a determined and organised Espanyol in the Spanish first division on Sunday. Valencia and Deportivo La Coruna failed to make up ground on the leaders as they were both held to 1-1 draws at bottom club Recreativo Huelva and struggling Osasuna respectively. Sociedad lead the table with 44 points from 21 games, Real Madrid follow on 42 and Valencia are another three adrift on 39. Radomir Antic was unable to get off to a winning start as the new coach of Barcelona after watching his side surrender a two-goal lead to end up drawing 2-2 at the Nou Camp. Kahns unbeaten run broken A last-minute goal by Hamburg SVs Naohiro Takahara in Berlin, stunned leaders Bayern Munich and ended goalkeeper Oliver Kahns Bundesliga record of more than 800 minutes without conceding a goal. Bayern were set to open a 10-point lead at the top before the Japan striker, who joined Hamburg in the winter break from Japanese champions Jubilo Iwata, scored in the 90th minute. Champions Borussia Dortmund lost 1-0 at VfB Stuttgart, who join Borussia on 36 points in second place. Croatias Zvonimir Soldo settled the match with a 77th minute goal. Midway through the first half Kahn broke his own record of 736 minutes without conceding a goal. Takaharas strike means the new mark is provisionally 802 minutes. If German Cup games are taken into consideration Kahns total is more than 1,000 minutes. (Reuters)  Copyright

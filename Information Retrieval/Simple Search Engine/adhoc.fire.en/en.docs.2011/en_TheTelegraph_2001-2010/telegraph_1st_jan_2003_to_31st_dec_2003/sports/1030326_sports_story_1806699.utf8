 India A fail to make semi-finals
Bridgetown: India As hopes of qualifying for the Carib Beer semi-finals were dashed by West Indies B Monday in Barbados. India A, chasing 268 to win in just under two sessions, finished on 205 for nine in 57 overs to earn a draw. The Indians needed an outright victory to displace Trinidad and advance to the last-four. Left-hander Connor Williams (75) top-scored, but once he was sixth out at 160, the Indian hopes subsided. The 29-year-old from Baroda hit nine fours off 109 balls in two hours. Last pair Tinu Yohannan (15 n.o.) and (19 n.o.) negotiated the last 17.1 overs adding 40 runs to ward off defeat. Earlier, West Indies B, resuming their second innings at 115 for seven, batted for more than two hours before being dismissed for 175. Lorenzo Ingram scored an unbeaten 35 of 133 balls and his last-wicket stand with fellow Jamaican left-hander Andrew Richardson (13) added 40 crucial runs in 48 minutes. Fast bowler Avishkar Salvi claimed the last two wickets to end with three for 40 off 13.3 overs while medium-pacer Jai Prakash Yadav (four for 46) added one to his overnight haul. The India A chase started badly with first innings century-maker Gautam Gambhir caught at first slip for one off Richardson. Williams got support from Akash Chopra (24), Abhijit Kale (22) and captain Ajay Ratra (16), but none could carry on. Chopra pulled to mid-wicket off Richardson, while Jason Bennett (three for 55) sliced through the middle-order. The 20-year-old from Barbados trapped Ambati Rayudu (0) leg-before and removed Kale and Yadav in successive deliveries. West Indies B ended their campaign at the bottom of the ladder while India A finished fifth. In the semis, fourth-placed Trinidad and Tobago play defending champions Barbados while second-placed Guyana host Jamaica. Brief Scores West Indies B 388 amp; 175 (L. Ingram 35; J.P. Yadav 4/46). India A 296 amp; 205/9 (C. Williams 75; J. Bennett 3/55). Match drawn.  (AP)  Copyright

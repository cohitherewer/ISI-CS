The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, September 30, 2003  Moon Mission may strike 
 BY STAR RACER		 Yadav Calcutta: Most of the runners  in the seven events on Tuesday, the penultimate meet of  the season, are out to seek the end-season favour at the  weights. However, the likes of Arikaras, Moon Missions,  Adderlys and Arrayals are expected to be genuine triers  and may win their respective events.				 										While Arikara, Adderly and Arrayal seem to have improved since their last outings, Moon Mission, being the youngest in the field of nine, is fancied to lift the 1,100m Unknown Warrior Cup, the main event. The in-form jockey R. Yadav partners the speedy daughter of Always A Rainbow-Moccasin who hails from leading trainer Daniel Davids stable. 				 										Race card and selections				 										1.

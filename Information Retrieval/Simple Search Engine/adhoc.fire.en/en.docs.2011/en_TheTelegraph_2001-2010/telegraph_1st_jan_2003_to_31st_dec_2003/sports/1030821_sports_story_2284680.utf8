 Prakash in India squad
New Delhi: Indias number one tennis player Prakash Amritraj was on Wednesday included in the Davis Cup team for the upcoming world group qualifying tie against Holland next month. Incidentally, Leander Paes had been selected in the teambefore news of his illness came through. Chairman of selectors Shyam Minotra said Amritraj, the highest ranked Indian on the ATP at 317, deserved to be in the team. We have selected him (Amritraj) on the basis of merit. He deserves his place in the team, Minotra said on Wednesday. Amritraj, son of former Davis Cupper Vijay Amritraj and a US-born citizen, became eligible to play for India in April this year but has reportedly said he wanted to play in Davis Cup only after April next year. Minotra said the selectors included Amritraj in the team despite the players wish otherwise because the best team needed to be picked up. Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna and Harsh Mankad are the other members. (PTI)  Copyright

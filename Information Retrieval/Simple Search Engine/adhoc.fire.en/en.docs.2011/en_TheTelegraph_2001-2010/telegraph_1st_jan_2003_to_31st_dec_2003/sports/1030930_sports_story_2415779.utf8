 Jugraj X-rays reveal bone loss
 Jugrajs elbow wound will take time to heal New Delhi: A fresh set of X-rays has revealed some bone loss on the right elbow of hockey star Jugraj Singh, the doctor treating the injured player said on Monday. The 20-year-old also has a wound on the elbow which will take some time to heal, said Dr Laljee Kent, senior consultant orthopaedics at the Batra Hospital and Reserach Centre. Though all the fractures had been operatively fixed, the player still has a wound on the posterior aspect of the right elbow joint, Kent said. The exact condition of the fractures, suffered by Jugraj earlier this month, was assessed with a fresh set of X-rays last night. It revealed the wound and bone loss which could take some time to heal, Kent said without giving any time frame for his complete recovery. Jugraj, who suffered fracture of the lower end of the right humerus involving the elbow joint and comminuted fracture of the right femur in a car crash in Jalandhar on September 2, was shifted here on Sunday from Ludhiana, where he was admitted following the accident. The doctor also said the player, who is recovering fast, will undergo a vigorous physiotherapy. His condition is stable and he looks quite cheerful. We are waiting for his injuries to heal before going for physiotherapy, Kent said.  The Asia Cup champion Indian team, meanwhile, dedicated the title to Jugraj, adds a report from Chennai. IHF secretary K. Jothikumaran said: The victorious team members have dedicated the Cup to Jugraj. We are going to meet him along with federation president K.P.S. Gill and other officials tomorrow morning with the Cup. We are grateful to the young boy for inspiring our players every day. We all pray for his quick recovery and return to the hockey field. We missed Jugraj. He always used to be a motivator and a good defender. We mainly missed him for his superb drag flicks, coach Rajinder Singh said. Captain Dhanraj Pillay was also looking forward to meeting Jugraj. All my players played this tournament for Jugraj. We are all going to see him tomorrow. Each and every member of the team decided to dedicate this Cup to him. Jugraj wanted us to win. Even yesterday he spoke to all senior players and the coach. Really, we played our heart out to win this Cup, so that Jugraj would be happy. We pray that he is back on the field soon for our country, Pillay said.  (PTI)  Copyright

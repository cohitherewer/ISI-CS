The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachins wicket surprises Gillespie 
Brisbane: Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie Sunday said even he was taken by surprise when umpire Steve Bucknor ruled Sachin Tendulkar out leg before off his bowling in the first Test here. It was a surprise because I had waited for so long and thought he would not be given out. It was a nice surprise when he was ruled out, said the pace spearhead. Sachin was a victim of a controversial decision as TV replays showed the ball was pitched outside the off and would have missed the stumps. Sachin looked stunned as Bucknor slowly raised his finger to rule him out for a three-ball duck. Gillespie, the pick among the bowlers snaring three wickets for 45 runs, gave credit to the Indian batsmen for the way they batted on the fourth day today. We put the balls in the right areas and tried our best but let us give credit to the Indians who batted very well. They let a lot of balls go away and then put away the bad balls. We stuck to our task but as I said credit to Indians for the way they batted. Gillespie also had special praise for Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly and V. V. S. Laxman. Ganguly batted very well. His footwork was very good and he played an attacking knock. As for Laxman there were a couple of moments when I thought he half-nicked it but he was very positive. Even someone like Akash Chopra showed he values his wicket even if he did not score any run for a while.  (PTI)  Copyright

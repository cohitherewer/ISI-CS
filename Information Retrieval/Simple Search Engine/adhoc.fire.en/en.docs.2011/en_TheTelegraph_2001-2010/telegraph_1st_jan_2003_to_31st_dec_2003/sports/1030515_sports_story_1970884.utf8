 Joe Cole in England squad 
London: England have drafted West Ham United midfielder Joe Cole into their squad for the games against South Africa, Serbia-Montenegro and Slovakia after Newcastle Uniteds Kieron Dyer withdrew due to injury. Cole, whose club was relegated from the Premier League on Sunday, has been promoted from the under-21 squad. I am disappointed to lose Kieron, England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said on the Football Associations official website on Wednesday. However, in Joe Cole I know I have a very good player who already has international experience and I am confident hell do a good job for the team, added Eriksson. England play friendlies against South Africa in Durban on May 22 and Serbia-Montenegro in Leicester on June 3 before taking on Slovakia in a Euro 2004 qualifier at Middlesbrough on June 11.

 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: Mohun Bagan are peaking at the right time, coach Subrata Bhattacharya said after his teams thumping 5-1 win over Dempo SC on Tuesday. He, however, added the defence of the title is still far away from his mind. 																								I want my team to stay in the hunt and for that we need to win all the home matches. The way we had beaten Indian Bank (4-0) and Dempo have been hugely satisfying. But I wouldnt speculate on the course of the League till another four or five matches are played, Subrata said. 																								The win handed defending champions 18 points from ten matches while Dempo have collected 20 from the same number of outings. East Bengal are leading the pack with 21 points from nine matches. 																								Before the match, I told my boys to go for win. The margin (5-1), however, was more than expected, the coach revealed. 																								Jose Ramirez Barreto, who won the Man of the Match award and later gave half of his prize money to Mohun Bagans opening scorer Lolendra Singh, felt the teamwork had inspired him to play better. 																								The whole team is playing wellI am drawing inspiration from it, the Brazilian said. He also lauded Lolendras goal, saying it was a class act. 																								Lolendra later revealed that he usually attempted this kind of shots during practice. I just connected it properly, he said of his goal.

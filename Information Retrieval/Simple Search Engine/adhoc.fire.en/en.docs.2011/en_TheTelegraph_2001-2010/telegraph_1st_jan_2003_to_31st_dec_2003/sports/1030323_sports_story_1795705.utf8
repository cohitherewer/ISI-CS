The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bopanna loses close final
Mumbai, March 22 (PTI): Rohan Bopanna slipped at the last hurdle of the $15,000 ITF mens Futures meet Saturday. The Indian Davis Cupper went down 6-7 (4-7), 6-7 (5-7) to Austrian qualifier Zbynek Mylnarik in the final. The final lasting an hour and 35 minutes was a thriller. The Indian, known for his booming serves, produced 15 aces. His backhand, though, let him down against the hard-hitting baseliner. The unseeded pair of Harsh Mankad and Vishal Uppal beat Dutchman Jasper Smit and German Daniel Lesske 6-2, 7-5. Mankad and Uppal had shocked British top seeds Jonathan Marray and David Sherwood in the semis.  Copyright

 BCCI objects to HC order
New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India on Friday objected to the Delhi High Court order, allowing all-rounder Ajay Jadeja to play all domestic matches. The BCCI said the order virtually amounted to lifting the ban imposed on Jadeja in the wake of allegations of match-fixing against him. It amounts to virtually lifting the ban on Ajay Jadeja, BCCI counsel Kapil Sibal told a division bench of Justice B.A. Khan and Justice O.P. Dwivedi, which had on May 28 passed an ex-parte interim order in favour of Jadeja. Sibal pointed out that the Justice J.K. Mehra award setting aside the five-year ban on Jadeja has been challenged and the same was pending before a single judge bench of the High Court. The BCCIs objections to the award are being heard by Justice Manmohan Sarin, whose next hearing is on August 7. However, the Court refused to pass any orders and said the May 28 order would continue. Expressing the hope that the challenge to the award would be decided within a month, the court posted the matter for September 3.  (PTI)  Copyright

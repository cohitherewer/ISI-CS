The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roy too good for Kamal
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Poulami Ghatak and Soumyadeep Roy after winning the womens and mens finals on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: He may not be Indias No. 1 table tennis player right now. But Soumyadeep Roy made it clear on Sunday he is not far behind. Soumyadeep was just too good for the current No. 1 Sharath Kamal, beating him 6-11, 11-8, 11-8, 10-12, 11-7, 11-7 in the mens final of the East Zone table tennis championships at the SAI Eastern Centre. Poulami Ghatak clinched her third title of the year beating Mamta Prabhu in the womens final 11-5, 11-7, 11-9, 11-6. Soumyajit Sarkar won the boys crown, defeating Subhadeep Das 11-7, 6-11, 11-6, 8-11, 11-6, 5-11, 11-8 while Anushree Saha downed Sayantika Kundu 12-10, 7-11, 13-15, 11-4, 11-7, 11-4 in the girls final. But Soumyadeep was surely the star of the show. He lost the first game 6-11 and started a little shakily in the second. But he started to get his range of shots going, pushing Kamal to the back-hand corner. He also looked extremely good in third-ball kills. Kamal found it difficult to return Soumyadeeps serves and the Bengal boy pounced for the kill. As the game wore on, Kamals unforced errors increased, allowing Soumyadeep to take complete charge. In the third game, Kamal was up 8-5 but a string of unforced errors and some superb shots by Soumyadeep helped him take the game 11-8. Soumyadeep lost a similar lead in the next game going down 10-12. Thereafter, it was one-way traffic. There were flashes of the Kamal brilliance that has made him the top player, but the power and precision of Soumyadeep was too hot to handle. Of late there has been a lot of criticism about my form. I decided this is the best way to prove the critics wrong, Soumyadeep said. The former India No. 1 felt the focus was just right. He also felt that his recent stint in Sweden has given a boost to his confidence. My club in Sweden had the rare opportunity to practice with the members of Jan-Ove Waldners club. Though I never got to practice with Waldner himself, those sessions have really been helpful, Soumyadeep informed. In womens final, Prabhu was no match for Poulami. An improved backhand and the heavy top-spin shots helped Poulami win in straight games, which incidentally is her third title. She has also won the West Zone and South Zone titles, the only failure being the Central. RESULTS (FINALS) MENS: Soumyadeep Roy (PSPB/CoE) bt Sharath Kamal (PSPB) 6-11, 11-8, 11-8, 10-12, 11-7, 11-7.

 No Japan tour for eves 
New Delhi: The Indian Womens Hockey Federation has decided not to send the national team for a four-nation tournament in Japan in September and instead concentrate on improving its game in preparation for bigger events, like the Afro-Asian Games and the Asia Cup. IWHF secretary Amrit Bose said on Wednesday that despite emerging victorious in a three-nation tournament in Russia, the team needed to improve in a number of areas. The Indian team returned from Russia on Wednesday after winning a three-nation meet. India started their campaign with a 7-1 thrashing of Russia before drawing 2-2 with Ukraine. In the second round, India lost 2-4 to Ukraine and drew 2-2 with Russia.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Spurs down Leicester 
London: Tottenham Hotspur stole a barely deserved 2-1 victory at bottom club Leicester City on Sunday to continue their improved run under caretaker-manager David Pleat. A 79th-minute goal by South African substitute Mbulelo Mabizela on his debut and a last-minute winner from Frenchman Frederic Kanoute turned the match on its head after a Kasey Keller blunder allowed Paul Dickov to give Leicester a first-half lead. The win meant Spurs jumped to 11th in the Premier League table on 11 points, while Leicester remained a point adrift at the bottom on five points. There were no goals in Sundays other two games between Birmingham City and Aston Villa in the Midlands derby at St Andrews and Everton and Southampton at Goodison Park. Birminghams point meant they went fourth in the table on 16 points, four adrift of third-placed Chelsea who were beaten 2-1 by leaders Arsenal (23) on Saturday. Spurs have now won three games and drawn one since Pleat took over from Glenn Hoddle, who was sacked last month.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

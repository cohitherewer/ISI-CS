The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Time needed to scan CVs
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, is back after the week-long ICC meetings in London and Monte Carlo, and top of his agenda is Adrian le Rouxs replacement. Ive been flooded with CVs from physical trainers However, it will take me a couple of days to shortlist the candidates and, only then, can the process be carried forward, Dalmiya told The Telegraph Monday evening. Dalmiya, therefore, wont be in a position to interview anybody on Thursday, though there have been agency reports talking of just that. Meanwhile, Alistair McCaw (one of the contenders) has informed that his contract with The Netherlands comes up for renewal either late this week or early in the next. Speaking exclusively from Rotterdam, McCaw said: If my contract is renewed, then, Ill be with the Dutch till the 2007 World Cup. Well, if the BCCI eventually leans towards McCaw, who has been with The Netherlands from last October, then it should act fast.  Copyright

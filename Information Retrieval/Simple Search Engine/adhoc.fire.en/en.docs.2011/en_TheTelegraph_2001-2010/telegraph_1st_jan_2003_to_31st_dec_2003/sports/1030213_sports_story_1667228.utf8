 Vijayan nets JCT winner
Ludhiana: JCT beat Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Bangalore, by a solitary goal in an OIL PSU National Football League match Wednesday. Mercurial striker I.M. Vijayan struck the winner in the 82nd minute, capitalising on a defensive lapse. The match was marked by several missed opportunities on the part of both teams. JCTs margin of victory would have been bigger had Hardip Gill not missed a certain goal in the second half before Vijayan, who joined the action in the second session, came to JCTs rescue. With this victory JCT have secured 18 points from 13 matches.HAL have only seven from 13. ITI hold Dempo In another match in Margao, Dempo dominated proceedings for most of the match but could only muster a goalless draw against lowly-ranked ITI. The draw put Dempo in fourth place with 21 points from 13 matches, while ITI remained at the bottom with 4 points.  (PTI)  Copyright

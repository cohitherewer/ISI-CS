 Churchill earn 3-1 victory
Margao: Churchill Brothers overcame a stiff second-half challenge to down Hayward 2000 Sporting Club 3-1 in an exciting match of the eighth National Football League at the Nehru Stadium here Friday. Churchill, who led 1-0 at half time, scored through Riston Rodrigues (18th), Osumanu Husseini (47th) and Tikken Singh (70th), while Dudu Omagbemi, kept on tight lease by defender Osumanu, pulled one back for Sporting. Sporting, who have won against JCT and drawn with Vasco, have four points from three matches and Churchill have seven points from two wins and one draw. After initial probing, Churchill drew the first blood when Tikken passed to Rodrigues who unleashed a left-footer from the top of the box that took the right post before finding the netting. Many Sporting forays were denied by keeper mark Mascasrenhas, once fisting away a cross from Venancio from the left with two rivals players well poised to score. After change of ends Churchill increased the lead with Osumanus 40-yard free-kick curling to beat keeper Felix. Sporting reduced the margin when a high cross from the right by Jerose Oliveira was headed in by Omagbemi. Many more Sporting attacks were foiled by the rival defence and keeper Mark. Churchill sealed the fate of Sporting when John set Tikken up with a through. The latter took a few strides before despatching the ball into the netting. (PTI)  Copyright

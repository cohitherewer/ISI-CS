 ICC under Wisden fire 
London: Wisden ripped the ICC apart, criticising many of its policies, including its handling of the Zimbabwe crisis during the World Cup, saying it had heaped shame on the game. Blasting the ICC for being at their worst for much of the past year, Wisden, published on Wednesday, said blundering ICC bosses ignored public opinion and turned a blind eye to Human Rights abuse, ordering Andy Flower and Henry Olonga to lay down their acclaimed black armbands. Editor Tim de Lisle accused ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed of reacting like a new father who hears someone criticising his baby when Englands aborted tie in Harare should have been switched to South Africa. And they adopted a stance on Zimbabwe that shamed the game. (PTI)  Copyright

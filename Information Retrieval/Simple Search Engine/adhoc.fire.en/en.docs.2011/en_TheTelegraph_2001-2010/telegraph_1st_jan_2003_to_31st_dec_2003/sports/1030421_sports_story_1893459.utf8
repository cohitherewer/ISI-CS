The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Intense draw at Bernabeu
- Action-packed night in spain and italy It was a typically intense derby clash between arch-rivals Real Madrid and Barcelona Saturday. Tempers flared as players got involved in a scuffle after Zidane fouled Puyol Madrid: Real Madrid striker Ronaldo and Barcelona midfielder Luis Enrique both scored against their former teams as the two arch-rivals fought out an intense 1-1 draw at the Bernabeu on Saturday.The result means Real move four points clear at the top of the table, but Deportivo Coruna and Real Sociedad will be able to narrow the gap to just a point if they win their respective home games on Sunday.Barcelona move up to 11th place, but are still just seven points above the relegation zone.We deserved to win the game, Barcelona coach Radomir Antic said. But I was very pleased with our performance and I can say that we were the better side. This result will certainly boost the teams morale.Earlier, Valencias hopes of securing a place in next seasons Champions League were thrown into jeopardy by a 1-0 defeat at modest Valladolid.Valencia stay fourth in the table just two points ahead of Celta Vigo as the two sides fight it out for the final berth in Europes top club competition.The defending champions have now won just one of their last seven matches and can be overhauled by Celta in the standings if the Galicians win their match at relegation-threatened Osasuna on Sunday.The 24-point gulf between Real and Barcelona was certainly not evident as the Catalans dominated for the game long periods and produced one of their best domestic performances of the season.Real had the first opportunity after Raul twisted free of Frank de Boer and slipped the ball to Ronaldo, but the former Barca player sent his shot wide of the post on five minutes.Barcelona responded strongly and striker Patrick Kluivert tested Iker Casillas with a sharp shot soon after but the Real keeper managed to get enough of a touch to the Dutchmans goal-bound shot to sent it spinning wide of the far post. But just when the Catalans looked to be getting on top, Ronaldo struck with a trademark finish on 16 minutes.French midfielder Claude Makelele snapped up a loose ball and hooked a hopeful pass forward towards the area where it fell into the path of the Brazilian who guided the ball inside the near post past Barca goalkeeper Roberto Bonano.There was a brief respite following the Real goal, but Barcelona managed to retain control of the midfield and Marc Overmars was a constant threat on the left wing.The former Arsenal player launched the move that led to the equaliser when he floated in a fine cross to the heart of the Real area where Kluivert met it with a powerful header.Casillas blocked on the line but the ball squirted out of his hands and former Real player Luis Enrique was on hand to poke into the open net on 32 minutes.Tempers flared soon afterwards when players from both sides got involved in a scuffle as Zinedine Zidane fouled defender Carles Puyol on the halfway line.Luis Enrique had a strong appeal for a penalty turned down midway through the half when he appeared to have been brought down by Real skipper Fernando Hierro.

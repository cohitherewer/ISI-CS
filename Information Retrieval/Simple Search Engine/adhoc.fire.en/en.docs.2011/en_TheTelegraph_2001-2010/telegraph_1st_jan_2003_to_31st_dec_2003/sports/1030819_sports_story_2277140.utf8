The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Argentina breeze past Germany
Amstelveen: Argentina left nothing to chance and chalked up a fluent 3-1 win against world champions Germany in the Champions Trophy on Monday. It was Argentinas first win in two matches, having lost 5-6 to Pakistan on Sunday. In the only match of the day, Argentina maintained an attacking posture and barely allowed Germany, who lost their first outing 2-3 to India, to go on the offensive. The intense and ceaseless pressure told on the Germans who added to their woes by missing a second-half penalty stroke when Alexander Sahmel hit the cross-piece. The game exemplified modern day hockey with tight man-to-man marking and very little individual play. On the few occasions when the German defence lapsed, allowing space to the Argentine forwards, the goals materialised. Jorge Lombi converted a fifth minute penalty corner to put Argentina in front. On change of ends, Mario Almada steamed in from the left on a Mattias Paredes pass and as he flicked a pass past the advancing goalkeeper, the ball got deflected into the goal off a defenders stick. A minute later, Germany, who are fielding a development team in this elite six-nation tournament, had their best scoring chance when Argentine goalkeeper Juan Manuel Vivaldi stick-checked Benjamin Kopp, leading to a penalty stroke. However, Sahmel hit the cross-piece. The Germans were punished for the lapse when Lombi converted yet another penalty corner in the 58th minute. Germany finally pulled one back five minutes before the hooter as Niklas Meinert found the target from a rebound following a swift right wing move.  (PTI)  Copyright

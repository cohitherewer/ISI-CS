The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Steve landmark in Aussies huge total 
 - THIRD TEST l WI continue to pay for missed chances  Ricky Ponting, whose fine form in the series continues, after reaching his third consecutive century in Bridgetown Thursday. (AP/PTI) Bridgetown: Australia captain Steve Waugh became the second highest-scorer in Test history as his side pressed relentlessly on in their first innings against the West Indies in the third Test on Friday. Steve Waugh made 115 as Australia declared at 605 for nine. At 2 am the West Indies were 16 for no loss. Chris Gayle on nine and Devon Smith (4) were at the crease. Waugh, nearing his 30th Test century, made an unbeaten 93 and Adam Gilchrist hit 65 as Australia reached 527 for five at tea on the second day after the West Indies captain Brian Lara won the toss and surprisingly sent them into bat on Thursday. Waugh overtook Indian Sunil Gavaskars total of 10,122 runs as he reached 60 in a typically gritty innings. Andy Bichel was not out for 45 at the other end in an unbeaten sixth-wicket partnership of 83. Waugh hit only two fours and required 170 minutes and 129 deliveries to reach his half-century, which he completed with a two helped by a misfield from Ramnaresh Sarwan. The 37-year-old, who in the first Test made a world record 157th appearance, made the most of his luck after being dropped early in the day on 11 when Sarwan at mid-off failed to take a difficult chance off a low Vasbert Drakes delivery. Waugh also escaped when he lofted a high ball to deep mid-wicket and Sarwan, after running about 40 metres, could not hold it. He ran for three to reach 60 and pass Gavaskars total. Waugh escaped again on 84 when he edged Lawson to Baugh but the Jamaican wicketkeeper was slow to react and could not hold the ball. Australia resumed on 320 for three and made steady progress in the morning after Darren Lehmann was out for 96 in the second over of the day. Lehmann was hit in the pad as he tried to pull Drakes delivery, which stayed down. English umpire David Shepherd raised the finger in what appeared a harsh decision. Waugh and Gilchrist kept the total moving along, with Gilchrist hitting a four and two sixes in successive balls off debutant Tino Best before lunch. Gilchrist dished out more harsh treatment to Omari Banks shortly afterwards, hitting another six over extra cover. Gilchrist went as he attempted another big hit. After driving Banks for four, he tried to hit the next delivery for six but got a top-edge and was caught at deep mid-wicket by Smith. On Thursday, vice-captain Ricky Ponting hit a century for the third Test match running. Ponting followed up his 117 in the first Test and 206 in the second by hitting 113 before being run out as Australia, already 2-0 ahead in the series, reached 320 for three at the close on the first day. Ponting, who received 204 balls and was at the crease for 300 minutes as he hit his 17th test century, came to the crease with Australia at 43 for one and batted with typical patience and determination.

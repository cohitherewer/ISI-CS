The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Boycott writes off NZ
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Geoffrey Boycott firmly believes India should win the Test series against New Zealand, while Sourav Ganguly says the team has to perform below potential if they are to lose to Stephen Flemings team. Shooting for a TV programme here on Thursday, Boycott said: If India are going to lose, they are going to lose it themselves. I dont see New Zealand having the quality of bowling or batting to rattle Indians at home. I am not discouraging New Zealand but if India performs anywhere close to its best, they will beat New Zealand. Sourav agreed promptly. If we dont win this series, I would think that we have seriously done ourselves something wrong. We will play at our best and try to win comprehensively. Sourav felt pitch should not be made an issue. Honestly, I feel we have made a big issue on the pitches in New Zealand and here. The pitches were difficult and although we lost the series, we did much better than what the results show. We were in a good position in Hamilton, we batted and bowled well. So I think, we are making it a big issue.  Copyright

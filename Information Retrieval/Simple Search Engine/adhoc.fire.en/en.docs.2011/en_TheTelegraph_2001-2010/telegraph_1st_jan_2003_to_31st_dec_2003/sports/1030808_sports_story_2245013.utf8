 Real cold shoulder pained Del Bosque
 Del Bosque feels the decision to get rid of him was wrong Madrid: Former Real Madrid coach Vicente del Bosque has made an uncharacteristic attack on the club for the way in which he was cast aside at the end of last season. In an interview broadcast on Spanish state television, the quiet-spoken 52-year-old said that the club had started to give him the cold shoulder when Real overhauled league leaders Real Sociedad in the final stages of the season. From the day we beat Atletico Madrid 4-0 and looked as though we would have a good chance of taking the titleI noted that no one at the club seemed pleased at what had happened. There was a certain coldness from inside the club as if their plans had been upset and they didnt know what will do next. I will remember that attitude for ever. Real went on to win the league title  the 29th in their history  but less than 24 hours later Del Bosque and club captain Fernando Hierro were dismissed. Former Manchester United assistant coach Carlos Queiroz was later appointed to take over as the new coach. Club president Florentino Perez said he felt that Del Bosques coaching techniques were becoming outdated. Del Bosque, who had been involved with the club for over 30 years as a player and coach, has strongly rejected such suggestions and hit back by saying that the decision to get rid of him was a mistake. The president went mad trying to explain what he had done, but he himself once told me that if you have to spend so much time justifying a decision then it must have been done badly. Del Bosque said that his achievements at the club had deliberately been undermined since his departure. The former Real coach, who led the team to two league titles and two European Cups has yet to find a job with another club. (Reuters)  Copyright

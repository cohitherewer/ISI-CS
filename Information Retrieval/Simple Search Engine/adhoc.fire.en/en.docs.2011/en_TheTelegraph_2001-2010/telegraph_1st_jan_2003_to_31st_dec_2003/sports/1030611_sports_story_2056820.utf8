The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Crisis deepens at Mohun Bagan
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: With the crisis in Mohun Bagan deepening day after day, the warring club members continued to be at loggerheads, showing no signs of mitigation. Amid the existing imbroglio, two players could not be signed Tuesday, which also put the impassioned supporters emotion to test. Two JCT imports  Hardeep Gill and Hardeep Singh Saini  were supposed to be signed for the green and maroon, but the officials assigned for the job were preoccupied with every other thing but taking the players to the IFA office. Meanwhile, the resignation of Justice Umesh Banerjee as one of the Special Officers, appointed by the high court to monitor the football-related affairs in the club, sparked off an angry reaction among supporters as they pushed and showered invectives on the warring officials when the team was practising in the morning. Incidentally, Aloke Mukherjees side got past a CC amp;FC outfit 2-0 in the practice tie. In another development, Debashish Dutta, the club official who, along with Shibaprasad Mukherjee, was assigned by the Special Officers to look after the players signing, said he had sent his resignation. But the dissidents disagreed. This means nobody is quite sure when the outstation players will be signed. Meanwhile, Justice Banerjees views on why he wants to quit will be heard by the court Wednesday. The other two Special Officers  Justice Shyamal Sen and Indrajit Sen  though, said they would continue to do their job.  Copyright

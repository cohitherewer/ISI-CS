				 																																	Houston: Andre Agassi moved within one win of the world No. 1 spot after crushing qualifier Ricardo Mello 6-0, 6-1 at the US Clay Court championships on Friday. Agassi, who will knock Lleyton Hewitt off the top of the ATP Champions Race rankings if he beats Mardy Fish or Jurgen Melzer in the semi-finals on Saturday, took just 43 minutes to overpower Mello.				 																																	To be No. 1 at all is a great accomplishment, so I would certainly feel rewarded in that, the top-seeded American told the ATPs official website. But for me, being No. 1 is also the result of playing the best tennis and improving it day after day. Over a 52-week period, to reach number one would be nice.				 																																	Agassi, the Australian Open champion, completed his 21st victory in 22 matches this year.				 																																	Sheffield: Holder Peter Ebdon moved into the quarter finals of the world snooker championship on Saturday with a 13-5 win over Maltas Tony Drago after a row over how long he spent during a toilet break.

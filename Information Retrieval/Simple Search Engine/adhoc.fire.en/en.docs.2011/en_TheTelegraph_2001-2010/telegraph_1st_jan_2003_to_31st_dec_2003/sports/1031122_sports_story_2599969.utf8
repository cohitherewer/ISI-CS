The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Paes, Prakash get wild cards
Chennai: Leander Paes and Prakash Amritraj have been awarded wild cards into the main draw of the Tata Open ATP Tour Championships slated to be held here from January 5 to 11. Prakash, son of Vijay Amritraj and Stephen, son of Anand Amritraj have also confirmed to pair in the doubles event of the tour, the lone ATP Tour championship in India. However, Paes, who is recovering from a brain lesion and who has not played in any tournament since August, has not yet confirmed his acceptance to play, the organisers said. Prakash, who is the top ranked Indian in the ATP list, said this is an exciting time for me. I am looking forward to playing in the tournament. It gives me an opportunity to start the season by playing in my fathers home town against some of the top performers on the Tour. It would also give a chance for Prakash to play against some of the worlds best players such as Carlos Moya of spain and Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand. Currently 193 in the ATP Champions Race rankings, Prakash was included in the Indian Davis Cup team for the World Group qualifier against Holland last September. (PTI)  Copyright

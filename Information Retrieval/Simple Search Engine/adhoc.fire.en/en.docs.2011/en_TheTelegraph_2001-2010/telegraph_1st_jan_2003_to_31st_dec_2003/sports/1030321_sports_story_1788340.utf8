The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Heightened security for final 
Johannesburg: Crickets World Cup final will go ahead as planned here on Sunday despite the opening of hostilities in Iraq, a tournament spokesman said on Thursday. However, the match will take place against a background of heightened security with more police on duty at the game, which takes place at the Wanderers here. Everything is on track and the final goes ahead as planned, said Rodney Hartman, the World Cup organising committees communications director. There are no plans to change the schedule but the match will take place with a heightened security awareness. The semi-final match between India and Kenya in Durban also saw more South African police on duty. However, there are no plans yet to post soldiers.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Humiliating defeat for Ranatunga
Colombo: Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga Friday suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Thilanga Sumathipala in the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka elections. Contesting for presidency, Ranatunga managed just seven votes against Sumathipalas 121. Ranatunga had earlier rejected an offer by Sumathipala to work together for the improvement of cricket, saying that he did not want to work with people who were tainted with allegations of corruption. Ranatunga was a non-starter from the beginning. His own home club had dumped him and decided to vote for Sumathipala. Dyson new coach Former Australian batsman John Dyson will be Sri Lankas next coach, Sumathipala said. Dyson played 30 Tests between 1977 and 1984, scoring 1359 runs.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Gibbs hits form
Cardiff, July 5 (Reuters): Herschelle Gibbs returned to form to help South Africa coast to a nine-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the tri-series match on Saturday. Gibbs, who had scored 11 runs in three previous matches in the series, scored an unbeaten 93 from 97 balls as South Africa overhauled Zimbabwes 174 for eight with more than 15 overs to spare at Sophia Gardens. South Africa captain Graeme Smith weighed in with 58, sharing in an opening stand of 154.  Copyright

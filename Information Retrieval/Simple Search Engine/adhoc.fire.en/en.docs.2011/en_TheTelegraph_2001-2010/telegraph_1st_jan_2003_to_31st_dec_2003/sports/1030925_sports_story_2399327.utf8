The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mohammedan Sporting to replace nine players
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 			Club to wait till Oct. 7 for reply from HabeebCalcutta: Mohammedan Sporting will wait till October 7 for any response from Mohammed Habeeb before beginning their search for a new coach. Meanwhile, the club has decided to release nine players, including Akbar Singh, Amjad Ansari, Arjan Ali, Trijit Das and Somen Sarkar. The club is looking for replacements, like foreigners for the National League. Habeeb left for Hyderabad on Wednesday and it is unlikely he will be back. Well wait for his response till October 7 and thereafter, assistant coach Nasir Ahmed will take over his position. P. K. Banerjee, will, however, continue as the technical adviser, a senior club official said on Wednesday. The club executive committee members, in a meeting on Tuesday, blamed Habeeb for the teams poor performance, following their exit from the IFA Shield, and decided to showcause him in this regard. We are trying to settle the issue (Habeebs discontinuation) amicably and it will hopefully be settled soon, said the official. Mohun Bagan will, however, face a problem of different sorts with their coach. On the same day Habeeb left the city, Aloke Mukherjee received his joining letter in the forthcoming national camp for the Afro-Asian Games as assistant to chief coach Stephen Constantine. Aloke said he would be joining the camp on October 2. Moreover, a 10-day conditioning camp before the tournament will also come in handy, Aloke said. A club official, however, said the coach will be released for the national camp. Meanwhile, East Bengal have been hit hard by injuries to some key players. Defender Mahesh Gawli, who was admitted to a nursing home last night with fever, has been released, but he remains unlikely for the second IFA Shield semi-final versus Ever-Ready on Friday. So is Debjit Ghosh, who has suffered a muscle tear in his right leg.  Copyright

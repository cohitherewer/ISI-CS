 Chandhok gives himself a year to make top tier
 Karun Chandhok shows off his Formula III circuit (scholarship class) trophy won in Britain, in New Delhi Wednesday. He said he had given himself a year to try and push into the Formula One grid, at least for a testing stint. Narain Karthikeyan is the only Indian so far to have tested a Formula One car. Picture by Jagdish Yadav New Delhi: Karun Chandhok, currently enjoying a purple patch in the British F3 (Scholarship) circuit, is giving himself up to next year to try and reach to as near as possible of the F1 track. We are adopting the right strategy this time and my ideal time frame to make it to the top bracket is sometime next year, Chandhok said here Wednesday. That, though, is the youngsters claim. What has to be factored into that is that he has to first earn a testing stint for F1 before he can even think of a reserve driver status. The 19-year-old admitted things had come to such a stage in F1 where it had become a lot harder for drivers to get a berth but said he was ready for the hardships ahead. F1 is now more than ever governed by sponsors and the amount of money you can flaunt. It is like who you know is more important than what you know. But I also know that if I do well this year  a very crucial period for me  I will definitely have a better chance of making the grade. Also I have the age on my side, he said. The former national and Formula Asia champion is currently adding another year of experience by continuing to participate in the scholarship class, a decision that was not easy for him to make initially but has now begun to show positive results. I have had a brilliant weekend at Silverstone. I have won four races and should have won the fifth too. , said the teenager. Chandhok is placed second in the championship points race behind teammate Steven Kane and his next race is scheduled for June 22.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Chinese want Gazza back
Beijing: Chinas B-league Gansu Tianma have not completely closed the door on trying to lure Paul Gascoigne back to the club. But they again demanded that the troubled player return to China before his contract can be renegotiated. Manager Zhang Tongbo said: Our attitude is that Tianma does not owe him any money, he was not at the club working from April, May and June, therefore we do not owe him any money from this period. Gascoigne has demanded that he be paid for those months before he returns despite having asked and been granted leave from the team during the period. Tianma maintains that Gascoigne is in violation of his contract and has vowed to seek redress through the English FA and Fifa. (AFP)  Copyright

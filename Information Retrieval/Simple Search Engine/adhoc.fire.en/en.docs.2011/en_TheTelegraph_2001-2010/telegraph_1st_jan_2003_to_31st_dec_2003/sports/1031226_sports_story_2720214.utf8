The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ranadebs five floors Gujarat
 Sanjib scalped 3 for 51 Ahmedabad: Bengal speedsters Ranadeb Bose (five for 55) and Sanjib Sanyal (three for 51) tore through Gujarat on the first day of their Elite group B Ranji Trophy match here Thursday. Gujarat were all out for just 179 runs in 78 overs. In reply, Bengal were off to a confident start and at the close of play were 35 without loss. With Bengal electing to field on a grassy wicket, Deb and Sanyal got to their task right away, sending four batsmen to the pavilion when Gujarat had managed to reach the double-figure mark in 14 overs. It was middle-order batsman Bhavin Thakars tenacious 87 which saved the day for the hosts who faced the threat of being bundled out within 100 when they were panting at 91 for eight at one stage. Gujarat batsmen had themselves to blame, going for rash shots that they did. Thakar, who came in when his team was tottering at 45 for five, displayed some gritty batting in only the third match of his career. Remaining unbeaten on 87 with six boundaries and two sixes, he also stitched the highest stand of 51 for ninth wicket with Lalit Patel (24). Thirty five-year-old skipper Mukund Parmar played his 67th Ranji match, the highest by a Gujarat player to date.  (PTI)  Copyright

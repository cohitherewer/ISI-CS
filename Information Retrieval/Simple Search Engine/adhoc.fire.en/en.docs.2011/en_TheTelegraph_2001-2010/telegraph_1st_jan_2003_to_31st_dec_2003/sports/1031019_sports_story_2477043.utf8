The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pontings 18th Test ton
Sydney, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Ricky Ponting scored an unbeaten century as Australia began to eat away at Zimbabwes total in the second Test on Saturday. Ponting, who scored his 18th Test hundred, was unbeaten on 137 with Steve Waugh on 43 when rain forced an early end to the second day. Australia were cruising along at 245 for three in their first innings when play was abandoned. That left them just 63 runs behind the Zimbabweans who made a respectable 308 after resuming at 256 for eight. Andy Blignaut chanced his arm to score an unbeaten 38 to help Zimbabwe edge past 300 then picked up two wickets of Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden .  Copyright

 Batsmen to blame: Badani
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  S. Sriram sweeps one on way to his 65 at the Eden on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: India A captain Hemang Badani on Tuesday held his batsmen responsible for the teams abject surrender in the Asian A Championship final against Sri Lanka A. We didnt bat to potential. Our top five batsmen scored only around 20 runs each which is never enough. Besides batting, poor fielding also let us down, Badani said. I cant really blame the bowlers. It was difficult to defend a total of 197 on this wicket. Moreover, poor fielding and missed catches made Sri Lankas task easier, he admitted. He spoke in the negative when asked if the selection of four players for the tri-series in Australia led to lack of motivation. There was no complacency at all. We spoke about this yesterday and vowed to put up a good show. The batsmen had promised a big total, but just could not deliver today. Sri Lankan captain Russel Arnold felt that the ability of their bowlers to come up trumps when it mattered made the difference. We never thought it would be so easy, he said. The left-hander, adjudged the Man of the Tournament for his brilliant batting, praised his bowlers, particularly Pervez Maharoof. His disciplined bowling put a lot of pressure on Indian batsmen which they failed to cope with. Arnold felt that the tour had made the youngsters learn to believe in themselves. Now its just a matter of being disciplined and hanging in there. Personally, the Lankan skipper felt the meett was good for my confidence in trying to make my way back to the senior side. Maharoof, who will lead the under-19 side in the World Cup, said his first tour with the A side has been a learning and good experience.  Kaif injury The injured Mohammed Kaif, who missed the final, is likely to be examined by Dr Anant Joshi in Mumbai. The batsman, who has a swollen finger, may be replaced by Dinesh Mongia if he is found to be unfit for the tri-series in Australia.  Copyright

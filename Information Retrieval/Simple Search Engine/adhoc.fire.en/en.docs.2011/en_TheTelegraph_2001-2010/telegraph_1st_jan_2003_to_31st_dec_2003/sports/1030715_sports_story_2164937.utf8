 Sehwag steers Leicester to win
London: Virender Sehwag scored a quickfire 76 from 59 balls to steer Leicestershire to a 76-run victory over Worcestershire in a National League one-day match at Oakham School last evening. Sehwag, who hammered eight fours and three sixes, put on 129 with his opening partner Trevor Ward (68) in 15 overs, the Countys highest for any wicket in its five-year history. Leicestershires score of 295 for seven looked vulnerable at one stage as Worcestershire needed 120 from 15 overs with eight wickets in hand. However, a decisive bowling spell from Jeremy Snape, who took three wickets in 16 balls, sealed the match. In another tie, Mohammed Kaif scored 44 as Derbyshire beat Sussex by six wickets at Arundel. Riding on a 129-run knock by Murray Goodwin, Sussex scored 232 for six in 45 overs. Derbyshire reached the target with six wickets in hand and 3.1 overs to spare.

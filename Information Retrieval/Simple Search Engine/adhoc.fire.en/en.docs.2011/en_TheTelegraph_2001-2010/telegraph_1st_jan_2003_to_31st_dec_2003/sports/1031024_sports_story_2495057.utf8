 Lara confident of ending dismal run
 Lara says WI will employ the four-pacer theory St Johns: The West Indies captain Brian Lara said on Thursday he is determined to end the squads dismal record in overseas tours, especially against the major cricketing nations. Lara and the rest of a 16-man squad are engaged in a five-day camp in Antigua, prior to embarking on the tours of Zimbabwe and South Africa. We have to go down there and make sure we take command of Zimbabwe and then head to South Africa which is going to be a very tough tour, Lara said. The guys understand... That we have been at the bottom for some time. Lara said: One of the problems in the recent past was that we werent able to get 20 wickets in a Test match and it is something we will have to address, he said. Officials have chosen six fast bowlers, including two  Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards  inexperienced ones and one rookie, Ravi Rampaul, for the African tour. But Lara said this was not a guarantee that the West Indies will return to the formula of fielding four pacers as they did in their heyday of the late 1970s to the early 1990s. Im not going to say that we are leaning towards our fast bowlers in a Test but definitely we are going to give the guys who we think are possible West Indian stars that opportunity, he said. West Indies have been known for four fast bowlers and we are going to exploit that, he said. We have three fast bowlers who are 19 (Rampaul), 19 (Taylor) and 21 (Edwards). I think the opportunity is there for them to evolve into something great. The West Indies will tour Zimbabwe from October 27 to November 30 and play two Tests and five one-dayers. They travel to South Africa from December 1 to February 5 for two Tests and five one-day Internationals.  (AP)  Copyright

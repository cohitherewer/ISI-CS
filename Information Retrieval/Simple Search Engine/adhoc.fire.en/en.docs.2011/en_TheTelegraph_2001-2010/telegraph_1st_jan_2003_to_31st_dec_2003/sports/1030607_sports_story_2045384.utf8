 Tendulkar returns home 
Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Friday returned home after a successful operation on his left ring finger at a hospital in Baltimore in the US. A tired looking Tendulkar arrived by a British Airways flight along with wife Anjali, daughter Sara and son Arjun. They were received at the airport by his elder brother Ajit. Family sources said Tendulkar was fine and would now work on his rehabilitation under sports medicine expert Dr Anant Joshi. Tendulkar had not only played with the injured finger in the World Cup but had also amassed over 600 runs to win the Man of the Tournament award.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Bond out of series 
Auckland: Shane Bond will miss the home series against Pakistan which begins later this month after a scan showed fresh damage to his troublesome back, NZC announced on Monday. Bond joins Nathan Astle as absentees series. The first Test in Hamilton starts on December 19. NZC medical co-ordinator Warren Frost said Bonds scan did not reveal a new fracture. However, it has shown that there is increased sclerosis (bony activity) and stress where the bone is re-forming from the stress fracture sustained in May, he said. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Special officers get control of Bagan bank
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The high court-appointed special officers, overseeing football matters at Mohun Bagan, have been given the liberty to take a decision on appointing or dismissing a sponsor. Justice M.H.S. Ansari of Calcutta High Court on Monday passed an order empowering the court-appointed special officers in this regard. The three special officers  Justices Shyamal Sen, G.N. Roy and Indrajit Sen  have also been empowered to take general financial decisions for the smooth running of the club, apart from looking after its daily affairs. The court order followed a petition filed by club assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury seeking a specific order of the court on these aspects. The ruling appears to be another blow to the clubs ruling body, which has recently vowed to organise elections at the earliest.  This was organised in an attempt to take the sheen off the football-related activities of the rival faction, of which Chowdhury is a key member. The new ruling means from now on, the club authorities can operate the clubs bank accounts for its football affairs only on the advice of the three-member panel. The court, however, dismissed Chowdhurys plea for restraining club secretary Anjan Mitra, from operating the bank accounts. Expressing satisfaction at the court ruling, Chowdhury later said it will lead to transparency in the clubs footballing affairs and will also help run it smoothly. Meanwhile, the club, reeling with the infighting, was witness on Monday to a rare moment of joy when footballers and officials gathered to celebrate the IFA Shield triumph. In the final on Sunday they beat arch-rivals East Bengal through the penalty shoot-outs. Coach Aloke Mukherjee said the win helped the team get the much-needed confidence to go through the season ahead.  Copyright

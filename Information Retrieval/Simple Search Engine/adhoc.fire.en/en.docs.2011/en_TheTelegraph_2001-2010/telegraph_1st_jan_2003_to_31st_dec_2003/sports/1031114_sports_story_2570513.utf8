 Randhawa in 17th spot
Gotemba (Japan): American Ben Curtis hit a seven-under-par 65 to take a one-stroke lead over Japanese rivals Masashi Ozaki and Kiyoshi Murota in the Taiheiyo Masters golf tournament Thursday, even as Indias Jyoti Randhawa was at joint 17th and Jeev Milkha Singh was joint 27th after first round play. This years British Open champion sank a five-foot putt for a birdie on his opening (10th) hole and then shot a chip-in-birdie from nine feet on the following hole before carding six more birdies against one bogey. Randhawa (one under 70) was in the pack containing Gregory Meyer and Christian Pena of the US, Dinesh Chand of Fiji and Australian Craig Parry.  (AFP)  Copyright

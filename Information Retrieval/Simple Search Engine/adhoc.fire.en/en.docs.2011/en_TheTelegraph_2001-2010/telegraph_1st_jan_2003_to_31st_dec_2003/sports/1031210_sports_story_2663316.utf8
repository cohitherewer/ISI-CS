 Narain to test for Euro Minardi
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The fastest Indian Narain Karthikeyan is set to get yet another chance to prove his mettle on the fast track of the motoring world. European Minardi Cosworth confirmed Tuesday that Karthikeyan, will take part in the teams three-day test at the Vallelunga circuit, near Rome, later this week. The racer from Chennai is scheduled to drive one of the Faenza squads PS03 chassis on Friday, according to information reaching here. The team has been following Karthikeyans career closely in recent years and, impressed with his on-track performances, wishes to take this opportunity to evaluate him in a current Formula One car. If the session goes well, there is a strong possibility the Indian driver could be asked to join the team in 2004. European Minardi has developed a deserved reputation as the team of choice for talented young drivers looking to launch their Formula One careers, such stars as Fernando Alonso, Jarno Trulli, Giancarlo Fisichella and Mark Webber all having raced for the Faenza squad in their first season in the sport. In fact, at this years Italian Grand Prix, eight of the 20 competitors who lined up on the starting grid at Monza were either former or current Minardi drivers. This is clearly a great opportunity for me, and to be offered this test by European Minardi demonstrates that people in Formula One have been taking notice of what I have been doing, said Karthikeyan.

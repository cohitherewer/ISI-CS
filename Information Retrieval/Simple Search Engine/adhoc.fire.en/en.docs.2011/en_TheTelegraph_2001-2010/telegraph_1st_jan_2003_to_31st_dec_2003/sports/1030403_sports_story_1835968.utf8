The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mongia set for world title
- Having won two scheduled races in the OK Dinghy class the Indian star is set to script history Nitin Mongia Panaji: Braving unfavourable weather conditions Indias Nitin Mongia won both the scheduled races at the Dona Paula beach Wednesday to be on the threshold of winning the OK Dinghy world championship.With about a minute to go, the start line seemed to be biased slightly to starboard. Mongia, who won two races Tuesday, and Nick Craig took conservative starts at the middle of the line. Craig tacked off at the first opportunity to go to the right hand side while Mongia stayed on starboard tack and the wind swung to the left.Mongia then tacked and stayed in phase with the wind throughout to lead comfortably at the windward mark ahead of Paul Rhodes and Rudiger Prinz.Craig, who seemed out of phase through the beat, rounded mid fleet. Mongia who had built up bit of a lead sailed clear while the other boats fought amongst themselves.At the finish, Mongia won comfortably with Prinz, who took advantage of a shift from the right, finishing second followed by Rhodes. Craig sailed through the fleet to finish fourth.In the fifth race, the second for the day, it was an even start off an even starting line. Sonke Berebs of Germany was the last boat at the committee end while Greg Wilcox was the first boat off at the port end.Once again Mongia and Craig took conservative starts with the latter tacking off again and Mongia staying on starboard.The shift Mongia was looking for did not materialise and he had to tack off and duck behind Craig who immediately tacked and forced Mongia back. But the Indian came and held a narrow lead at the windward mark.They held their positions around the leeward mark and split tacks on the second beat.Rhodes, who was on the right, sailed through Craig (on the left) and Mongia (playing the centre) to round the windward mark first followed by Mongia and then Craig. Mongia, however, took advantage of his superior downwind speed to round the leeward mark ahead of Rhodes. He then powered away to win his fifth consecutive race. Morrison came out of the right side to take the second spot with Rhodes and Craig following him. (PTI)  Copyright

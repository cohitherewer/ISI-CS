 India A push Windies B to the wall
Bridgetown: India A bowlers sliced through the batting of West Indies B to set up a winning opportunity in their rescheduled Carib Beer cricket match in Barbados. Medium pacer Jai Prakash Yadav took three for 18 off 14 overs and leg-spinner Amit Mishra, two for 27 off 13 overs, as India A fought back after conceding a first innings lead of 92 Sunday. India A must win the match outright to displace Trinidad and advance to the Carib International Challenge semi-finals. Barbados, Guyana and Jamaica have already secured spots in the line-up. West Indies B stumbled to 115 for seven at close, a head by 207. Earlier in the day, India A resumed from 210 for three and were bowled out for 296 as they lost seven wickets for 86 runs in just over three hours. Gautam Gambhir, who scored a century Saturday, added just one to his overnight score before he was caught behind off fast bowler Jason Bennett for 108. Captain Ajay Ratras 38 provided the main Indian resistance in the middle and lower order.  (AP)  Copyright

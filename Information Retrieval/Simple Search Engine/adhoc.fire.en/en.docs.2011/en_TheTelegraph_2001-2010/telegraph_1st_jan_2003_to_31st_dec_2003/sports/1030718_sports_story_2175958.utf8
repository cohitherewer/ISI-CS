The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav wants to play for Kent
Calcutta: Indian captain Sourav Ganguly intends to turn out for Kent in the County Championship next season. Lavishly praising the County structure, Sourav said in an interview with the All India Radio on Thursday: A player can improve a lot playing on the bouncy wickets there. It steels ones nerves. He added that the international calendar next season is not that crowded and he wants to utilise the spare time playing there. I wish to turn out for Kent, Sourav said. He also expressed surprise with the ICCs decision of demoting India to number eight from five in the latest one-day rankings. Its very strange. I dont know how the ICC derived its conclusions. I see no logic behind this, Sourav quipped. He referred to Indias performance over the last season, when they made the final of the World Cup, won the NatWest Trophy and emerged joint winners of the Champions Trophy. Our showing has indeed been good, the captain argued. Currently, India are above Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and Kenya in the standings. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WI steer clear of follow-on
 - Lara smashes unbeaten 178 including record 28 off a Peterson over  Brian Lara on the rampage at the Wanderers on Sunday. (AFP) Johannesburg: Brian Lara broke a Test record on Sunday by hitting 28 runs in an over to help steer the West Indies away from trouble on the third day of the first Test against South Africa. Lara put left-arm spinner Robin Peterson to the sword in the penultimate over of the day, driving for four, six, six, four, and four, and then cutting the last ball for four. The previous record was 26 conceded by Younis Khan of Pakistan against New Zealands Craig McMillan in 2000-01 in Hamilton. McMillan hit five fours and a six. At stumps on Sunday, Lara was 178 not out with the West Indies on 363 for six in reply to South Africas first innings of 561, still 198 runs in arrears. Captain Lara has been in the wicket for six hours, facing 239 balls and hitting 28 fours and two sixes. It is his 23rd Test century. Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who scored 34, shared a stand of 125 for the fourth wicket that stemmed the tide after South Africas bowlers delivered a hostile morning session. Laras innings, however, was not without missed opportunities. He was first dropped on 15 by Shaun Pollock and again on 62 by Peterson. Lara later said he was inspired by Indias performance against Australia. The West Indies captain told reporters he had been up early watching TV where India were batting against Australia in Adelaide. India are taking on Australia, the best team in the world, and were taking on the second best team in the world, Lara said. I watched Dravid and Laxman and I used some of their strength out there today. We are the underdogs in this series and we need to fight. Lara said of his record 28 in an over.I had no intention of going for it. I just wanted to get as many runs as possible. The genial Peterson, 24, said:Hopefully Ill learn from it and be a better bowler as a result. (Reuters)  Copyright

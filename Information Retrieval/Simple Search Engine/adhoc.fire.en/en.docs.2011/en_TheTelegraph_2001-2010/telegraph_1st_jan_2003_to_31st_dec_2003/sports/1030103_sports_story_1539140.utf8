		 Friday, January 03, 2003 				 Cairns, Harris in Cup XV
																								Christchurch: Ace all-rounders Chris Cairns and Chris Harris were named Thursday in a 15-member New Zealand squad for the World Cup cricket tournament, starting in South Africa next month.																								The seasoned pair missed the two-Test series against India and then the first three one-dayers of the ongoing seven-match series due to injuries.																								Cairns has scored 3,614 runs and taken 154 wickets in 151 one-day matches. Harris has made 3,955 runs and bagged 192 wickets in 216 one-dayers.																								Chairman of selectors Richard Hadlee said experience was the main criteria for picking the squad for the high-pressure tournament.																								New Zealand are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies, Sri Lanka, Kenya, Bangladesh and Canada, with the top three teams qualifying for the Super Six series.																								New Zealand, however, have yet to decide whether Cairns will play as a specialist batsman or as an allrounder.																								They have packed their squad with all-rounders as Andre Adams and Scott Styris were also named after missing the first three one-dayers against India.																								New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming said he was confident his team would perform well in South Africa. I am glad the bowlers are feeling good about themselves heading for South Africa. We will need that confidence, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Martina, Agassi flay scheduling
			New York: Martina Navratilova claimed that the scheduling at the US Open is the worst she has ever seen, while Andre Agassi has also voiced concerns. Its the worst schedule that I have ever been a part of in any Grand Slam, Navratilova said. The other players, they would say the same thing. But they havent played in as many Grand Slams as me. I dont remember it this bad ever. The structure of who makes decisions needs to change, Navaratilova said. They have not been consulting players. The people who make decisions arent allowed to make decisions. Nobody can make a decision and the ones than can will not until they absolutely have to. Their motto is Dont do something. Just stand there. Its very frustrating. A review of the Super Saturday line-up, which enjoys very high television ratings, will be undertaken next year with an eye toward possibly moving the mens semi-finals and womens final to different days. Agassis concern is that the mens semis and final not be played on consecutive days, a staple of the US Open. That could mean shifting the mens final to Monday or playing the first round in two days instead of three. Playing matches back-to-back can have their toll, Agassi said. Sometimes its mental as well. It has always been difficult. It makes winning a little bit more special but its something you wish you didnt have.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

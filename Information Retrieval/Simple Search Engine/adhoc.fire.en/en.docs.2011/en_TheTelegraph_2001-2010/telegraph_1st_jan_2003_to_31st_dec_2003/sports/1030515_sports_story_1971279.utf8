The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hewitt edges out Clement
Hamburg: Lleyton Hewitt claimed his second nailbiting victory in two days when he edged past Arnaud Clement of France 6-7, 6-4, 7-6 to reach the third round of the Hamburg Masters. It took the Australian world No. 1 more than three and a half hours to squeeze out the victory, which followed a two hour 22 minute battle on Tuesday against German wild card Markus Hantschk. Hewitt, struggling against the heavy conditions, dropped the first five games before staging a remarkable comeback that almost earned him the set. He pulled back to 5-5 and held off six set points before leading the tiebreak 7-6. But a netted forehand cost him his chance and a perfect drop volley from Clement gave the Frenchman the set. Hewitt fought back in the second set to lead 5-0 before Clement pulled back to 5-4, but then dropped his serve to give Hewitt the set. (Reuters)  Copyright

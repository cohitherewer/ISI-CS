The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dempo cautious vs East Bengal 
 Okoro is a doubtful starter Margao: National Football League leaders Dempo would be keen to continue their winning streak when they take on defending champions East Bengal in a crucial match of the championship here on Saturday at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda. Dempo, with 13 points from five matches, have done well at home and elsewhere beating Mahindra United and JCT. Our aim is to collect full points and I am confident my boys will maintain the same form tomorrow, although it is going to be a tough match, he said. East Bengal have not attained their peak form but may play to their potential and beat us. So we have to be cautious and cannot be complacent. East Bengal, who have collected eight points from five matches will be looking to strike their right rhythm. East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick was optimistic even though Douglas da Silva Santos has been ruled out due to injury. Mike Okoro, who reached here after a prolonged Christmas vacation on Friday, is a doubtful starter. [It is learnt that the club may take disciplinary action against Okoro for his prolonged absence, adds a Staff Reporter in Calcutta]. Tomorrows match will be tough. We will play a cautious game as our opponents are playing well,  said Bhowmick. (PTI)  Copyright

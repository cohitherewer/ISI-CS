 Pankaj, Aditya in knockout round
Taupo: National champion Pankaj Advani and Aditya Mehta confirmed their berths in the knock-out round of the IBSF world u-21 snooker championship with easy wins in their penultimate league matches here on Tuesday. The third Indian entry, Calcuttas Sourav Kothari, has won only two of his six matches in group E, and has very slim chances of advancing. He needs to beat Patrick Einsle of Germany 4-0 in the concluding league fixture on Tuesday which would boost his frame difference from the present 2 to +2 and then await the results of other matches to know his fate. In the seven-player group F, 18-year-old Pankaj from Bangalore, brushed aside Qatars Nisar Ahmed Saif 4-0 for his fifth consecutive victory that put him on top of the group and confirmed his progress to the round of 32. In an otherwise inconsequential match, Pankaj plays Albert Kenny of Ireland on Wednesday. Kenny, with four wins, has already progressed to the knock-out stage. Also in are Jamie ONeill of England and Saif, with a 6-3 record. In group D, Mumbai lad Aditya had a comfortable outing, trouncing David Meer-Bailey of New Zealand 4-0. It was the 17-year-olds fifth win in six matches and assured him a spot in the knock-outs. Aditya, thus followed Mark Allen of Ireland, Tian Pengfei of China and Jamie Jones of Wales into the round of 32. Meanwhile, defending champion Ding Junhui of China topped group A (PTI)  Copyright

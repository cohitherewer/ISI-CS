				 																																	Berlin: Bayern Munich striker Roque Santa Cruz will be out for at least six weeks after suffering a knee ligament injury in a friendly against Turkish team Galatasaray in Spain. This is a tough setback for us and we regret it deeply, Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld was quoted as saying by German news agency SID. We had put great hopes into Roque. We had hoped he would develop into a key player.				 																																	Apart from the 21-year old Paraguayan, Bayern Munich could also miss midfielder Jens Jeremies when the German league restarts after its winter break in two weeks time. Jeremies, 28, injured his left ankle during Fridays friendly against Galatasaray, which ended 0-0. The full extent of the injury has yet to be determined, but Jeremies will at least miss some days of training.				 																																	London: Striker Ruud van Nistelrooy is keen to extend his stay with the Manchester United. I feel at home here and want to play as long as possible with this club or I know Ill be very sorry when Im an old man, the Dutch international said on Sunday.				 																																	The 26-year-old has always insisted he will return to his former club PSV Eindhoven, but said he could be tempted if United offered him an extension to his current contract.				 																																	My contract ends on July 1, 2006, the same day that I become 30 years old. But when the club wants to give me a new contract, I will be happy to agree to stay longer.				 																																	Hawaii: Despite a double bogey-par finish, Ernie Els shattered the 54-hole Mercedes Championships scoring record and tied a PGA Tour scoring record while moving even closer to his first win on the Plantation Course on Saturday. Els shot a second consecutive 65 to move to 25-under-par, four shots better than the tournament record set by David Duval in 1999. The South Africans score also ties the 54-hole Tour record set by Gay Brewer in 1967. 				 																																	However it wasnt only Els breaking records as South Koreas K.J. Choi fired a course-best 11-under 62 to move within two shots of the world No. 3. 				 																																	London: Newcastle Uniteds French winger Laurent Robert is unhappy with the way he is treated by his teammates and says leaving the club could be a solution. You cant say I get on with my teammates. I only get on with the foreigners, Robert was quoted as saying in Sundays News of the World. 				 																																	I have the impression theres a conspiracy against me and against our foreigners in general.				 																																	London: Chelseas Icelandic striker Eidur Gudjohnsen says he lost 400,000 in five months at the casino after he became sucked into a gambling habit. I knew if I carried on I would end up losing everything, he was quoted as saying in Sundays The People.				 																																	The newspaper said Gudjohnsen was betting up to 2000 on a single spin of the roulette wheel as well as playing blackjack.

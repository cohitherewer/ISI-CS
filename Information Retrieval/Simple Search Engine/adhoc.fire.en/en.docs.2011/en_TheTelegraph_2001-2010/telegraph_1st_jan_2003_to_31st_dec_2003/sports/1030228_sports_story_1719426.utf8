The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies rout Namibia, top group
 - Glenn McGrath captures seven for 15 as records fall like nine pins  Matthew Hayden pulls one en route to his 88 against Namibia Thursday. (Reuters) Potchefstroom: Australia qualified for the World Cup Super Sixes in emphatic style on Thursday, crushing Namibia by 256 runs amid a flurry of world records. The world champions sealed a record-equalling 11th straight one-day International victory by the largest ever winning margin, Glenn McGrath producing the best World Cup bowling figures of seven for 15 as Namibia were routed for 45. The group A match was a statisticians dream, with records tumbling as frequently as Namibian batsmen in the sunshine at Potchefstroom. 			Darren Lehmann smashed a World Cup record 28 runs in the final over of Australias innings to lift his side to a total of 301 for six, and Adam Gilchrist took six catches to equal the best haul by a wicketkeeper in ODI. Lehmanns big-hitting brought him 50 from only 31 balls and inflicted on Rudi van Vuuren the fourth worst bowling figures in one-day history as he finished with no wicket for 92 runs from 10 overs. Lehmann clubbed 4, 4, 4, 6, 4 and 6 from the medium-pacers over to take Australia past 300. His effort improved the previous World Cup best in an over, the 26 plundered by Brian Lara off Canadas Barry Seebaran only last week. The victory confirmed that Ricky Pontings side would top the group with one match still to play against England on Sunday. Best figures The Namibia batsmen were humiliated by McGrath, who eclipsed his previous best figures in one-day Internationals, the five for 14 he captured against West Indies at the 1999 World Cup. Only West Indies fast bowler Winston Davis, with seven for 51 against Australia at Headingley in 1983, had previously taken seven wickets in a World Cup innings. Only one player, Namibia captain Deon Kotze, reached double figures as extras top-scored with 15 in an innings lasting a mere 14 overs. Gilchrist held the final two catches of the innings off Andy Bichel to give him six victims. Bichel had come into the side as a late replacement for Jason Gillespie who was rested as a precaution after suffering an injury to his right heel on Wednesday. At least Namibia, in their first World Cup, had the small consolation of passing the previous lowest score in the World Cup, the 36 made by Canada against Sri Lanka earlier in the tournament. Before Lehmanns carnage, Matthew Hayden (88) and Andrew Symonds (59) took the chance to get some time in the middle ahead of the next stage of the competition. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Solid start by WI after Kallis takes SA to 561 
 Jacques Kallis en route to his 158 on Saturday Johannesburg, Dec. 13 (Agencies): The West Indies made a solid start in pursuit of South Africas massive first-innings score. Having dismissed the home team for 561 minutes before tea on Saturday, the West Indians reached 87 for one at stumps on the second day of the first Test at the Wanderers. The visitors lost the wicket of Wavell Hinds (10) at 43. Daren Ganga (49) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (20) were at the crease as the Caribbeans chased 362 to avoid following on. Jacques Kallis built on skipper Graeme Smiths first-day effort with his 12th Test century. Kallis took his tally from the overnight 87 to 158  his highest score against the Caribbeans. In making his fourth 150-plus Test score, Kallis hit 17 fours and a six in the 297-ball essay. South Africa, resuming on 368 for three, seemed to continue from where they had left with Martin van Jaarsveld (overnight 69) clipping the fourth ball of the day  off Mervyn Dillon  through mid-wicket for four. Two balls later, though, he didnt offer a shot to a fairly straight delivery, and Darrell Hair had little hesitation in raising the finger. Neil McKenzie joined Kallis but, like his provincial teammate Jacques Rudolph yesterday, failed to impress. It took him 19 balls to get off the mark and, after an hour at the crease, McKenzie got a top-edge attempting to pull Fidel Edwards and gave wicketkeeper Ridley Jacobs an easy catch. TV replays, however, suggested that Hair may have erred as the ball seemed to have brushed the batsmans shoulder, and not the bat or gloves. Mark Boucher was the sixth wicket to fall. He made 27 before falling to a brilliant catch by Daren Ganga, who dived low to his right at gully to pluck the ball out of thin air. Kallis and former captain Shaun Pollock added 54 for the seventh wicket, before Kallis got one which kept slightly low and the batsman bottom-edged it onto his stumps. Pollock was out three overs later, edging Wavell Hinds to Jacobs. Andre Nel was bowled by Hinds next ball. A spirited last-wicket stand of 41 followed between Robin Peterson and Makhaya Ntini, with the latter hitting two fours and one massive straight six off Hinds in one over. Peterson was the last man out, caught by Jacobs for 25. Hinds ended with three for 79, while Edwards, Dillon and Corey Collymore took two each.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav: Still possible to get it right 
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Sourav Ganguly watches the first days play from the pavilion in Mohali on Thursday. (AFP) Chandigarh: Its been a mix of both  good batting from New Zealand and bad bowling from our side... Whatever the eventual total, well have to bat very well... opined regular Team India captain Sourav Ganguly, at the end of Day I in Mohali. Understandably, he didnt go into specifics, but did tell The Telegraph: Actually, its not impossible to get it right even from here (New Zealand on 247 for one)... Sourav, however, wont be around to see that happening  if at all. He is, after all, scheduled to leave for New Delhi on Friday afternoon and will connect to Calcutta that very evening. Having been forced to miss this second (and deciding) Test, Sourav is now looking ahead. Yet, even he isnt sure whether he will be able to play the opening tri-series game  in Chennai, against New Zealand, on October 23. In fact, Sourav was in considerable pain on Thursday evening and made another trip to the Fortis Hospital in Mohali. The doctors changed the dressing but, somehow, its quite painful, he remarked. Sourav, it may be recalled, underwent minor surgery in the left hip region on Tuesday. Meanwhile, he continues to receive get-well-soon messages. The one from a Ghaziabad-based panwallah, though, left him stunned. Believe it or not, that gentleman called on Souravs cellphone!  Copyright

 Sunny: NCA on right path
Bangalore: Sunil Gavaskar Wednesday said that domestic cricket in India was not very competitive and that the National Cricket Academy was striving to produce competitive cricketers with flair. Gavaskar said Australia had a very competitive structure and if we can do that (at NCA), the standard will be that much better. After an interaction with zonal academy coaches, Gavaskar said NCA was moving in the right direction, and expressed happiness with its progress. (PTI)  Copyright

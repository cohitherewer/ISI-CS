The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Laxman likely to return
 - ODI squad - Rohan Gavaskar is dark horse  FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Laxman is expected to take Dinesh Mongias place  Chandigarh: V.V.S.Laxman, who had no role in  Team Indias last two one-day commitments, is tipped to  make a return during the October 23-November 18 tri-series  at home where world champions Australia and New Zealand  are the overseas sides. The national selectors, with Syed Kirmani in the chair, are scheduled to meet on Thursday  in all probability after stumps on Day-I of the second (and final) Test versus New Zealand, in neighbouring Mohali. They will be naming XIV for the first three matches, in Chennai (New Zealand), Gwalior (Australia) and Mumbai (Australia). The squad for the last three (league) games, in Cuttack (New Zealand), Bangalore (Australia) and Hyderabad (New Zealand) will be chosen at a later date. As of Wednesday evening, regular captain Sourav Ganguly will be picked. However, if he doesnt recover in time for the first match, on October 23, his place could be taken by Hemang Badani. Assuming, of course, that the latter himself is fit. Laxman, it may be recalled, was dropped for the World Cup (in February-March) and wasnt available for the Dhaka tri-series  owing to a back injury on the A tour of the West Indies  immediately after that tournament. Besides looking in good nick, Laxman has got runs against Australia. Its logical, therefore, that he makes the XIV, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. Laxman is expected to take Dinesh Mongias place. Unless theres a rethink, Murali Kartik is also favoured to stage a comeback. Out of the frame, as of now, is Sanjay Bangar while Ashish Nehra still hasnt recovered from surgery. Incidentally, with Rahul Dravid indicating he would be happier just concentrating in front of the wickets, theres a move to have Parthiv Patel in the squad. Only, its unclear whether that will actually come about. The dark horses, so to say, are Rohan Gavaskar and Sridharan Sriram.  Copyright

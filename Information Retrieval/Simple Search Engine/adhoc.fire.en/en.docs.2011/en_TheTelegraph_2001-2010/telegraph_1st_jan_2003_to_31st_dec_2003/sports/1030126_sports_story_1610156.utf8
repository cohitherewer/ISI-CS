		 Sunday, January 26, 2003 				 Side under immense pressure: Donald
																								Cape town, Jan. 25 (Reuters): South Africa fast bowler Allan Donald said on Saturday his side are under immense pressure to be the first host country to win the World Cup.																								We have got a very unforgiving sporting public and their expectations are very high, Donald said on Saturday. But playing in front of those South African crowds will be motivation in itself.																								Donald said he had spoken to 1995 rugby union World Cup winning flyhalf Joel Stransky and now had a clearer idea of the sort of pressure the hosts would be under throughout the meet.I spoke to Joel Stransky recently and he said to me that only when he ran onto the field did he realise what pressure there was to win a World Cup in your own country. 																								Donald said he wanted to end his career with a World Cup winners medal, after missing out at the semi-final stage in 1992 and 1999. The one ideal is to win the World Cup, for me...it would be even more special.

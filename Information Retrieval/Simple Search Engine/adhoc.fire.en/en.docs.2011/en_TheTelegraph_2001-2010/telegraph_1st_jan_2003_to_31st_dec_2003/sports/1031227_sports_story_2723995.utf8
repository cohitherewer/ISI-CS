The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lara, Jocobs rescue WI
 Brian Lara, on way to his 72 in Durban on Friday Durban: Brian Lara and Ridley Jacobs resurrected West Indies first innings with half-centuries before rain halted play on the first day of the second Test against South Africa on Friday. But fast bowler Makhaya Ntini kept the home side on top as West Indies, who were put into bat on a lively pitch, reached 232 for eight with Vasbert Drakes on 40 and Adam Sanford on 13. Captain Lara (72) and Jacobs (58) added 98 for the sixth wicket after West Indies had slumped to 57 for five at lunch. Ntini had figures of four for 56 when rain ended play 25 overs early but felt the visitors had been let off the hook. After lunch we didnt bowl well, we didnt do the basics well and Lara and Jacobs took us apart, said the pacer. He added: We know Lara is a big wicket and if you miss a chance to get him out he can dominate and make a big score. South African coach Eric Simons said: Sometimes youve got to give credit to batsmen, but I think we took our foot off the gas today. Maybe we tried to bowl them out rather than stick to the plan that had worked. Maybe we tried to bowl too many glory balls rather than stick to disciplines. South Africa captain Graeme Smith asked the visitors to bat on a seaming pitch and under overcast skies that aided swing bowling after rain delayed the start of play for 30 minutes. Wavell Hinds started the slide without a run on the board when he attempted to leave the last ball of the first over from Shaun Pollock and edged it to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. In his next over, Pollock found the outside edge of Ramnaresh Sarwans bat and the catch flew to Jacques Kallis at second slip. Sarwan was dismissed for four. Ntini first struck in the sixth over when Daren Ganga, on six, prodded outside his off-stump and was caught by Pollock at first slip. Twelve balls later, West Indies slumped to 17 for four when Ntini had Shivnarine Chanderpaul caught by Andrew Hall at third slip for a duck. Lara and Carlton Baugh kept the South Africans at bay until 10 balls before lunch, when Baughs edged drive off pacer Andre Nel was caught at second slip by Kallis. Baugh hit four fours in his 21. The West Indies might have been 58 for six eight balls after lunch when Lara, on 13, edged a delivery from Ntini to Hall at slip but Hall dropped a sharp chance to his left hand. Lara and Jacobs were eventually separated 13 overs before tea after Lara failed to avoid a short delivery from Ntini and was caught by Pollock at first slip. He had faced 111 balls and hit 12 fours. Four overs later Jacobs was trapped in front by Nel having faced 69 balls and stroked 11 boundaries. South Africa lead the four-match series 1-0 after winning the first Test by 189 runs.

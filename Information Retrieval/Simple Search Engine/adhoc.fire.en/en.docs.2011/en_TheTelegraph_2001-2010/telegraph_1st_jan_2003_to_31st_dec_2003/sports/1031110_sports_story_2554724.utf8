				 																																	Dhaka: Paul Collingwood, a regular member of Englands one-day team for the last two years, believes he is close to making his Test debut after being awarded a central contract from his countrys cricket board in September.				 																																	Thats a motivator, he said on Sunday. The board always want players who can play in both forms of the game and, by getting a central contract, I feel nearer to a Test place.				 																																	I know I have to get into the Test team by whatever way possible, Collingwood said. Ill just go about my business and work harder. 				 																																	Melbourne: Ireland skipper Keith Wood announced his retirement from all rugby here on Sunday, following the 43-21 World Cup quarter final defeat to France.				 																																	The talismanic hooker, who battled back from a series of injuries to play in his third World Cup, said he was hanging up his boots after a glittering 57-cap international career. Its the time, thats it, Wood, 31, said. Time to hang up the boots from all rugby. Its a doubly sad day today. 				 																																	Sapporo: A player from the Dominican Republic was kicked out of the World Cup womens volleyball tournament after testing positive for using banned medicine, it was announced on Sunday. The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) said Nurys Arias Done tested positive after her samples on Monday and Wednesday showed the presence of banned drug Methandienone. The FIVB officials summonned Done for a hearing Saturday and she was excluded from the remaining matches of the tournament. The FIVB said it would suspend her for two years with immediate effect. 				 																																	Belgrade: Partizan Belgrade supporters pelted stewards with plastic seating as their side crashed 3-0 to city rivals and league leaders Red Star on Saturday.

In-form striker Nikola Zigic scored once in each half while Man-of-the-Match Marko Perovic scored the other goal at the Marakana stadium.

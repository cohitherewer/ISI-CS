 Hadlee named NZC selection manager
Wellington: New Zealands greatest cricketer, Sir Richard Hadlee, has been appointed to a new position on a restructured national selection panel. Hadlee, formerly chairman of selectors, was on Monday named selection manager of a panel which will include newly appointed national coach John Bracewell. Bracewell, a former Test off-spinner and contemporary of Hadlee, was appointed New Zealand coach on July 3, replacing Denis Aberhart. The new selection format, announced by New Zealand Cricket (NZC), awards Bracewell the right of veto on all team selections. Bracewell, who has recently enjoyed success as coach of the English County Gloucestershire, hinted strongly earlier this month he was not prepared to be a bystander in selection debates. He said he could not be expected to accept accountability for the performances of a team he had not chosen.  (AP)  Copyright

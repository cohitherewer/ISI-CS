The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kirmani hopeful of 1983 encore
 - Souravs boys peaking at right time  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  KIRMANI: Candid and confident Cape Town: Syed Kirmani, a member of that history-creating 1983 World Cup side, is convinced Sourav Gangulys Team India can win the 2003 edition. The process of peaking has begun at the right time and I see no reason why the present side cant do a 1983, Kirmani, who is around on a sponsored trip, told The Telegraph Wednesday afternoon. He added: Ive always had faith in this team and, back in India, Id said that the defeats in New Zealand were actually a good omen... That the side would come together and bounce back on wickets conducive for good cricket. Then, Sourav has been captaining well According to Kirmani, the difference between Australia and, say, India and New Zealand isnt huge. As they say in Hindi, unnis-bees ka difference hai... Its not like the West Indies team of 1983 which, at the start and during the tournament, was streets ahead of all other sides... Asked whether his opinion on Rahul Dravid being made to keep had changed, Kirmani answered smiling: In principle, the wicketkeeper must be a specialist. However, Rahul is doing a good job and, so, ought not to be changed... Theres been a purpose behind giving him the responsibility and, to my mind, he has been doing his best. Kirmani, though, declined to pick the most outstanding keeper of this World Cup. Look, nobody has been exceptional, though Ridley Jacobs took a couple of great catches the other day... Just about everybody has had the odd miss... Looking ahead, to Indias first Super Six match (against Kenya, Friday), Kirmani cautioned: The boys shouldnt get complacent... Cricket, after all, can give some hard knocks. Of course, Ill be surprised if we dont comfortably put it across Kenya. The signing-off couldnt have been more pucca.  Copyright

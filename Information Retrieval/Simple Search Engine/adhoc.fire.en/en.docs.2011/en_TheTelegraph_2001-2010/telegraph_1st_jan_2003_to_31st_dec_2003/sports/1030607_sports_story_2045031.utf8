Picture by Santosh Ghosh. Mallika Mondal, who broke the under 20 high-jump record Calcutta: Four meet records were written and one equalled on the second day of the 53rd state athletic championships at Salt Lake Stadium and SAI, Eastern Centre Friday.Mukti Saha emerged the fastest woman, although she missed out on the record. The experienced Eastern Railway sprinter broke away from the pack near the 70m mark to win the 100m comfortably in 11.9 seconds.The record-breakers on another steamy day were Ram Prasad Atta in mens discus, Dipak Singh in boys under-20 discus, Rahmatullah Molla in boys under-18 200m and Mallika Mondal in girls under-20 high jump. Shilpi Dhali equalled the girls under-20 100m mark.Atta, a 29-year-old discus thrower representing Mohun Bagan, has been dominating his event for almost a decade and a half. His effort of 45.14 metres Friday bettered his own mark of 44.60 set last year.This was the 12th time Atta had won the discus event in 13 years at the state meet. Malda boy Dipak Singh hurled the discus a distance of 39.90 metres to comfortably improve Mithun Patras record of 35.38 in the boys under-20 category. Rahmatullah Molla of South 24 Parganas clocked 22.3 seconds in the boys under-18 200m race to overturn Dipankar Gayens existing mark (22.6).The days sole record on the distaff side was crafted by Mallika Mondal who leapt 1.67 metres in girls under-20 high jump. The versatile Mallika, representing City AC, also won the 100 hurdles in 16.7 seconds. Nadias Shilpi Dhali equalled the girls under-20 100m mark by clocking 12.1 seconds.Sanjay Rai predictably won the mens long jump without a problem but fell short of his targeted distance of 7.50 metres in his comeback event.

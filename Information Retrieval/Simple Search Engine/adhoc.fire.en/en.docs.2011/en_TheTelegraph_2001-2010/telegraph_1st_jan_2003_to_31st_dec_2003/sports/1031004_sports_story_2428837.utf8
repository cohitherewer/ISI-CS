 Shock defeat for Humpy 
New Delhi: GM Koneru Humpy suffered a shock defeat against C. Praveen Kumar in the second round of the Parsvnath international chess meet on Friday. C. Natarajan came close to pulling off another upset, against second seed P. Harikrishna, but conceded the point following a blunder under time pressure. GMs Abhijit Kunte, Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Dmitry Svetushkin and Jonathan Rowson scored comfortable victories to maintain their cent per cent record in the 11-round event. Against Humpy, Praveen forced a small advantage in the middle-game following a queen-pawn opening and gradually exerted pressure on his opponent to bag the point after 50 moves. In some other surprising results, R.R. Laxman, V. Koshy and M.R. Venkatesh lost to Mithilesh Srivastav, D.S. Negi and Vikas Sharma, respectively.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Rio in team vs Spurs
Manchester: Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand will play against Tottenham Hotspur Sunday regardless of the outcome of his disciplinary hearing with the FA, manager Alex Ferguson has confirmed. Ferdinand is facing a commission, set up by the FA, to answer charges of misconduct for failing or refusing to take a drugs test in September and was presenting his defence on Friday. A verdict is expected by Friday evening, but even if it goes against Ferdinand, United will have 14 days to appeal and he would be permitted to play on until any outcome of an appeal. Im pencilling him in to play on Sunday, Ferguson said. Its not ideal preparation but hopefully hes got the temperament to handle it.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

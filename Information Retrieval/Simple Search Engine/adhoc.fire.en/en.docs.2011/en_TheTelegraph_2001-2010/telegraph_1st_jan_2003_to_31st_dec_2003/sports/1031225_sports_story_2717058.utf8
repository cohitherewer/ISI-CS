The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Gerrard desperate for the elite berth
 - Medio may ponder change if Liverpool fail to make the cut  BY HENRY WINTER  Gerrard feels they havent been consistent enough Like children with chocolate, they could not hide their covetous eyes. The huge screen in Liverpools training-ground canteen was parading Champions League highlights and the players kept glancing up from their lunch, their chats and games of pool to watch Zinedine Zidane, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Thierry Henry gracing the greatest club stage of all. It hurt to watch. Hurt badly. All the top players play in the Champions League, said Liverpools dynamic captain, Steven Gerrard, a straight-talking soul maturing impressively as a man and a midfielder. All the top clubs are in the Champions League. Its where all the exciting stuff happens. I am desperate to play in it next year. Currently an unacceptable ninth, Gerard Houlliers side need to get their act together quick if they are to turn reverie into reality. Performing in the Thursday-night provincial theatre that is the Uefa Cup, Gerrard spends his Tuesdays and Wednesdays flicking through Champions League matches, transfixed at the feast on view. I have been following Chelsea, looking out for Arsenal and Manchester United, and surfing for Real Madrid because I love watching them. The other day, Roberto Carlos, who is the best left-back and best left-midfielder in the world, and the right-back Michel Salgado were both up in the box! Real go for it. It was very brave selling Claude Makelele because they havent really replaced him with an out-and-out holding midfielder; Ivan Helguera has come in and done well but that is one place where they might have to strengthen if they are to win the Champions League. I have always watched Real  and Barcelona  but now with David Beckham going there, its good to see how he is playing. Hes flying. What a decision he has made. When he first made the decision I questioned it. I was thinking if he doesnt do too well, he might regret going. He has proved any critics wrong. He is coping brilliantly. Inspired by Beckham, Gerrard has pondered following suit. Yes. I am sure every player has done. Thats not for me at the moment. If we are successful here and play in the Champions League I am sure I will stay. If that doesnt come my way, I will sit down and realise I have ambitions to fulfil. I will have a big think about it. Its a very, very difficult question for me. I love this club. I am settled here now. I want to be successful at this club. I want to be in the championship race. I want to be playing Champions League [here]. Before I signed the new contract, I sat down with [chief executive] Rick Parry and the manager and they told me what their plans are for this club. I was happy with what I was told. If we finish in the top four, I have been assured the squad will continue to be strengthened. We are ninth in the table so it doesnt take a rocket scientist to work out we need certain players in certain areas. Liverpool must also persuade Michael Owen to sign a new contract. Gerrard said: Its very important Michael stays. Hes our main player. Speaking to him, he wants to stay, he loves the club, but he also wants Champions League football. It is very important while he is out injured, the players try and move back up the table. The injuries are a big, big factor but I am not the type to look for excuses, stressed Gerrard. We havent been good enough, not consistent enough. When I look at the table, it hurts to see us in ninth. But I am not going to panic. We can qualify for the Champions League. Captaincy has added to Gerrards determination. Every time I put the armband on, it gives me a big boost. People should come out of their shells more, accept the challenge we have ahead and take more responsibility. Liverpool are one of the biggest and best clubs in Europe so we should be up there; the fans expect us to be in the championship race. The fans have been very patient besides Saturday, seeing us getting beaten at home to Southampton. You cant really complain about the fans getting a bit edgy. There was a lot of booing and jeering; when certain people gave the ball away, they were jumping on peoples backs. Gerrard is fully supportive of Houllier. People have short memories. You only have to look at what was happening at the club when the manager took over and what he has achieved. He has made a good squad but he still needs to make it stronger to get up to the level of United, Chelsea and Arsenal. The dressing room is united behind Houllier. Yes, definitely, there are no splits in the camp, no chipping away at anything. The manager is popular because he comes out and supports the players when they are having bad times. He sticks by us. Hes a good manager. The manager is calm but he is definitely up for it in his team talks; you can see he wants to win.  THE DAILY TELEGRAPH  Copyright

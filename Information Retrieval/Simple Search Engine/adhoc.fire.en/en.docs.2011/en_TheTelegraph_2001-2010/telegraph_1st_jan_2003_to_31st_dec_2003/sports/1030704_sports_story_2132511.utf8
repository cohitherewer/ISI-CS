 Perec gives up on comeback
Paris: Triple Olympic champion Marie-Jose Perec has as good as given up hope of running in the IAAF World Championships in Paris next month, she said on Thursday. The Frenchwoman is still suffering from an irritated sciatic nerve. She has not competed since Sydney. The Frenchwoman had fled the Sydney Olympics before competing, saying she had received telephone threats. In a statement, Perec said she had to be given injections to ease the pain. Like on previous occasions, I will have to wait for one or two weeks to see if the injections are successful, which jeopardises very strongly my chances, she said. In an interview with sports daily LEquipe, Perec said she retained a very slim hope of taking part in the world meet. Theres a very slim hope. In theory, I have until August 13 to clock the qualifying time for the worlds, but it seems very, very difficult to me.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

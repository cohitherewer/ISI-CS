 India may bid for 2016 Olympics
New Delhi: India are considering bidding for the summer Olympics after being chosen to stage the 2010 Commonwealth Games. The 2016 Olympics will be the next logical step for India, Suresh Kalmadi, president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) said on Wednesday. Well go after them and get them to India as well. New Delhi beat off a challenge from Hamilton in Canada to win the Commonwealth Games earlier this month. It will be only the second Asian host in the Games 80-year history. The IOA has formed a committee to look into the feasibility of hosting the Olympics for the first time. The Commonwealth Games will make New Delhi a well-known sports destination, with all the best facility available, Kalmadi added. Itll make our winning the bid for the Olympics that much easier. New Delhi hosted the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982. Athens and Beijing will host the next summer Olympics in 2004 and 2008. The 2012 hosts will be decided in 2005.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

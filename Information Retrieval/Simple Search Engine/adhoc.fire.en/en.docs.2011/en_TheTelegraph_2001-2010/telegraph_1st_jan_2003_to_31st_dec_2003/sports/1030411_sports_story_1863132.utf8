 Hooper wants to fight back
London: Axed West Indies captain Carl Hooper said Thursday he had not retired from international cricket and intended to fight his way back into the team. Hooper, sacked as skipper after the World Cup, said he would not be available for the Test series against Australia and Sri Lanka. Asked by Sky Television if he had retired, the 36-year-old said: Not by a long shot. I want to remain active. I dont want to be out for too long. Hooper was replaced by Brian Lara as captain and then withdrew from the West Indies squad after being selected for the first Test against Australia which started Thursday. Chairman of selectors Viv Richards responded by saying he was not aware of Hoopers long-term plans but thanked him for his contribution. Hooper, speaking over phone, said he had withdrawn from the squad for personal reasons.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

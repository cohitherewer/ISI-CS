				 																																	Paarl: Sachin Tendulkar might have played a role in Brian Laras magnificent ton which helped the West Indies score an upset win against South Africa in the World Cup opener.				 																																	It was a Tendulkar-autographed bat from which the runs flowed, the star West Indian batsman revealed. Look at the bat. See here is the signature of Sachin on the logo! a smiling Lara told players who had gathered to congratulate him after he scored a masterly 116 off 134 balls studded with 12 fours and two sixes in Cape Town on Sunday.				 																																	Lara was sure of his little Indian friend also getting big scores in the tournament. Its the biggest stage for any cricketer. And I am sure Sachin too will be hungry to score big hundreds here.				 																																	Cape Town: England allrounder Craig Whites World Cup campaign could be over before he bowls a single delivery on Wednesday after he suffered a recurrence of a side strain injury. The England medical team will examine White after complaining of discomfort from his left side after net practice in Cape Town.				 																																	Craig has a history of side problems and we are at the 11th hour so we have to make a decision, captain Nasser Hussain said.				 																																	White first sustained the injury during the fourth Test against Australia in December in Melbourne, ruling him out of action for six weeks. He bowled a full spell during a warm-up match against Border last week without experiencing any pain.				 																																	He was fine when he bowled 10 overs last week but he felt it on Tuesday and has not improved much since, Hussain added.				 																																	If Whites relapse is serious, England will ask to call up a replacement, with batting allrounder Adam Hollioake and fast bowler James Kirtley the likely candidates.				 																																	London: Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan on Wednesday blamed Waqar Younis decision to ask Australia to bat first for the huge defeat Pakistan suffered in their World Cup match on Tuesday.				 																																	Once the first 10 overs have been bowled, its very difficult to stop a good batting team like Australia on a good batting pitch, Imran said on BBC Online. Although the Pakistani bowlers did get four Australian wickets quickly, they could not apply the brakes once Andrew Symonds got going. Its very difficult for a team batting second to chase a massive total like that. 				 																																	Ottawa: Canadas obsession with ice hockey took a rare back seat on Wednesday as papers triumphantly proclaimed the countrys first victory in a cricket World Cup match. A day after Canadas part-timers pulled off a shock 60-run win over Bangladesh in their opening game in Durban, pictures of celebrating players dominated most front pages.				 																																	Canadas Miracle on Grass , thundered a banner headline in the Ottawa Citizen. Stunning win puts Canada on cricket map, announced the National Post. No-name Canada raises cricket fuss, said the Globe and Mail.				 																																	Canadas only other World Cup appearance was 1979 when the team lost all three of their matches and set a record for the lowest number of runs scored in a game  45.				 																																	n West Indies vs New Zealand, live from 1.30 pm on SET Max n India vs Holland, highlights from 8.00 am on DD-I n Pakistan vs Australia, repeat from 9.30 am on DD-2

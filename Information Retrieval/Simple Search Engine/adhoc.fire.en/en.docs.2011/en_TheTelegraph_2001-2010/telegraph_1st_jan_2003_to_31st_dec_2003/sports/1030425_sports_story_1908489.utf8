The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Alvito hopeful
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Alvito DCunha is still hopeful of landing a contract with South African club Manning Rangers. The East Bengal and India attacker had impressed the South African top division club during a series of exhibition matches there last year. They (Manning Rangers officials) got in touch with me 15-20 days back through the agent who organised our trip, which means they are still interested in me, said DCunha Thursday. The former Salgaocar striker added he will make the trip if things work out in his favour.  Copyright

 Kerala to meet Bengal in semis
Chennai: A hattrick by Sharanjit Kaur helped Punjab defeat Karnataka 4-0 in the 11th national womens football championship here on Thursday. Kerala defeated Goa 2-1 to enter the semi-finals. Punjab did not have to exert themselves much and Sharanjit scored the first three goals (17th, 44th and 45th minutes), before striker Gurmeet Kaur made it 4-0 in the 75th minute. In an earlier match, Kerala went into the lead in the 39th minute through Angel Adolphes. Subitha Poovatta increased the lead in the 10th minute of the second half. Sharon Fernandes reduced the margin for Goa in the 61st following a free kick by Maria A.F. Gomes. In the last four, Kerala join defending champions Manipur and twice former champions Bengal. Kerala, qualifiers to the quarter final stage, have moved in with a clean slate. The fourth team to the semi-finals will be spotted Friday. (PTI)  Copyright

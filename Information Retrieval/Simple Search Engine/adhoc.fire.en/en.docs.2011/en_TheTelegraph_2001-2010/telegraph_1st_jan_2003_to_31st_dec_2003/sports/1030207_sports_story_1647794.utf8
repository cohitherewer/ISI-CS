The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England eves pip India by one run
New Delhi: A brilliant 98-run knock by Mithali Raj went in vain as India suffered an agonising one-run defeat to England in their last league match to finish their dismal campaign in the Mini World Cup womens cricket tournament in New Zealand Thursday. In the inconsequential match, India lost a wicket on the last ball of their innings to be bowled out for 207 after England had scored 208 for four on being asked to bat first. Mithali, world record holder for the highest score in womens Test cricket, was unlucky to be run out just two runs short of her second one-day century. Her innings was studded with 12 hits to the fence. Mithali put on 92 runs for the fourth wicket with Hemlata Kala to bring India within 24 runs of the England total. But India lost their last five wickets for just 23 runs, according to information received here today. India finished the four-nation tournament with just one win from six matches,k but were placed third, ahead of England, because of a bonus point. (PTI)  Copyright

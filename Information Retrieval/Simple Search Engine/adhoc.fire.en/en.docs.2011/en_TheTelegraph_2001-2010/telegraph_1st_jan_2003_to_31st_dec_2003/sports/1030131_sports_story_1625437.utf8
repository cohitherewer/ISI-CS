		 Friday, January 31, 2003 				 Tribute to Cronje may divide SA team
				 	 CRONJE: In the news, even in death																								Durban: The decision of a few South African players to dedicate the World Cup to their former captain Hansie Cronje may indirectly be interpreted as their concern for the current leadership, a leading sports psychologist has said.																								Dr Ken Jennings, who was attached to the South African team between April 2000 and May 2001, believes that the dedication has the potential to divide the side in future and may have negative connotations for Shaun Pollocks side in the coming seasons.																								Allan Donald and Jonty Rhodes, two of the seniormost players of the South African squad, had declared last week that they would dedicate the World Cup to their former teammate Hansie Cronje who was banned for life after admitting to having received money from bookmakers.																								The UCBSA had quickly distanced itself from the cricketers decision, saying the dedication was a personal tribute from Donald and Rhodes.																								This hankering after Hansie should be considered on two levels, Jennings said Wednesday. Firstly, it is a reflection of the direct result of the huge influence he had on his teammates while captaining the side, but indirectly, the pair may also be expressing some concern for the present leadership of the side.																								The issue has the potential to divide the side on some level in the future, especially in stressful situations, Jennings said. 																								Jennings, however, stressed that the dedication did not mean that Rhodes or Donald were condoning Cronjes wrong- doing.																								South African coach Eric Simons said: At first I was a little surprised and concerned. We had a long chat about it in Drakensberg and now I am much happier, he said from the teams training camp in Newlands. Jonty said that Hansie had done so much for him and that it was a very personal gesture. It is not a team dedication  simply a personal one from Jonty and Allan. (PTI)

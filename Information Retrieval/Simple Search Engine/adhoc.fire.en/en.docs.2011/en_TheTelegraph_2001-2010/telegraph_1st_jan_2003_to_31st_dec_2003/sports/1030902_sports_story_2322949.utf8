 Szabo may have a heart problem
Bucharest: Olympic champion Gabriela Szabo, who struggled home 11th in Saturdays world athletic championship 5,000m final in Paris, could have a heart problem. The 27-year-old double world champions husband Zsolt Gyongyossy said Monday she would undergo more intensive tests to see if the problem was life-threatening. The first thing we did was an electrocardiogram which revealed a problem, he said. I dont know yet if its serious. He said Szabo might retire from athletics if the condition proved serious.

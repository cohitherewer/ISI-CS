 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Indian Football Association (IFA) has drawn out a revised list of fixtures for the forthcoming Calcutta Football League. According to the new fixtures, presented to the clubs on Friday, the Super Division of the CFL starts from June 17. East Bengal will start against Eastern Railway on June 20. Mohun Bagan will kick off their campaign on June 24 against Bhratri Sangha. The first East Bengal-Mohun Bagan clash has been scheduled for the first week of July. The IFA has also chalked out new fixtures for the IFA Shield, originally scheduled to start on June 20. According to the new fixture, the Shield gets off on September 14 and will be over by September 30. We could not fit in East Bengals CFL matches before September, hence the change, a top IFA official said. East Bengal will take part in the ASEAN Cup starting July 14 and many of their players will be at the national camp starting August 13 for the LG Cup.  Copyright

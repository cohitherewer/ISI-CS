 England notch up 7-wkt win
 Michael Vaughan after leading England to victory with an unbeaten 81 in Dhaka on Saturday. (AP) Dhaka, Oct. 25 (Agencies): An unbeaten 81 by skipper Michael Vaughan helped England triumph over Bangladesh by seven wickets Saturday, the fifth and final day of their first Test. After losing three early wickets, Vaughans fourth wicket stand with Graham Thorpe (18) helped England make the required 164 runs to win within 75 minutes after lunch in 39.2 overs. Vaughan, who rediscovered his form to hit his first half-century since taking over as captain earlier this year, said the win was hard work. Bangladesh are improving and gave us a hard time in the five days. We did a lot of hard work to win the match, Vaughan said after the game. The captain praised his bowlers  especially seamers Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison  for doing a good job on a placid wicket. Durhams Harmison was named Man of the Match for his nine-wicket haul, including his career-best five for 35 in Bangladeshs first innings. Hoggard claimed seven wickets. Bangladesh captain Khaled Mahmud was also happy with his teams performance, but blamed inexperience for the well-fought loss. We are improving and we will do better in the next match, Mahmud said. Bangladesh, who have not won in 25 matches since becoming a Test nation in 2000, have shown encouraging performances in recent matches under coach Dav Whatmore. I am happy and proud of my boys, they played well in the match, Whatmore said. Bangladesh prevented England from taking a large first innings lead after bowling them out for 295 Thursday. Englands second innings began Saturday with Marcus Trescothick  who hit a century in the first innings  being stumped out on 27 by wicketkeeper Khaled Mashud off spinner Mohammad Rafique. Mark Butcher then went out leg-before for eight off another Rafique delivery. England went to lunch just 74 runs away from victory with eight wickets in hand  opener Vaughan was unbeaten on 41, while his predecessor Nasser Hussain was on two. But Hussain could manage only 15 more runs after lunch before he was trapped leg before by pacer Mashrafee bin Murtaza. Earlier, England wrapped up Bangladeshs second innings for 255, by taking the last four wickets.  Clarke fined Meanwhile, England allrounder Rikki Clarke was fined half his match fee for swearing at a Bangladeshi batsman. Match Referee Wasim Raja of Pakistan imposed the penalty after a hearing on Saturday, a day after Clarke taunted Bangladesh middle-order batsman Mushfiqur Rahman.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bedi, Kapil do not fancy Indias chances
 BEDI New Delhi: The win against Zimbabwe might have given the Indians a much-needed boost to their World Cup campaign, but the former greats are not ready to look too far ahead. While Bishan Singh Bedi doesnt give India more than five per cent chance, Kapil Dev feels they really have their task cut out. Bedi blamed excess commercialisation and poor leadership by Sourav Ganguly as the reasons behind Indias slump. We dont even have five per cent chance of winning... Our sight should be on the Cup, whereas we are just thinking of qualifying for the Super Six, Bedi said. Apart from playing, they should learn to respect the game, he quipped. Having a go at Sourav, he said: Anybody who rates himself higher than the game is not the right person to lead... He doesnt own up his mistakes, and that is what irks me. Expressing concern over the influx of money flowing into the game, Bedi concurred that the players have lost their focus spending too much time for commercials. Meanwhile, Kapil said in Pondicherry that Indians will really have to work hard to even make the Super Six stage. The comfortable victory against Zimbabwe should spur the boys for better results, he said. He also urged the boys not to be complacent with the games against England and Pakistan coming up.

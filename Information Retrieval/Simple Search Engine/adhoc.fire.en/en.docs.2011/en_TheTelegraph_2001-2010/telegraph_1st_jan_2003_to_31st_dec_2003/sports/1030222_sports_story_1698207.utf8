The Telegraph - Calcutta
 East Bengal keep fingers crossed
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: On paper and current form, East Bengal look clear favourites to clinch the National Football League title this year. But coach Subhas Bhowmick is worried about any slip, however small it may be, on the eve of Saturdays clash with relegation-threatened ITI. Everybody is saying that the gap between my team at present and the cup in future is very minute. But there can always be a slip between the cup and the lip, after all, cant there? Bhowmick said on Friday. There are still eight matches to go. Lots of upsets can take place in that time, a cautious East Bengal coach said. East Bengal will have the services of only one of the four foreigners  leading scorer Mike Okoro. East Bengal are leading the the table with 34 points while ITI, lowest down the ladder, are almost certain to be relegated, having gained just four points.  Copyright

 Injured Grant pulls out
Harare: Grant Flower has been forced to pull out of Zimbabwes two-Test series against the West Indies starting next week with a broken finger. Flower is among the few established Test players available to Zimbabwe following the retirement of several senior players during and after the 2003 World Cup. The veteran batsman and steady slow left-arm bowler broke his right-hand finger in a domestic match six weeks ago and will not be ready for duty until after the series which starts in Harare on Tuesday. Ive still got a cast on my hand and Ill only be back for the one-dayers (which start on November 22), Flower said on Sunday. Ive been doing some one-handed batting and bowling in the nets. Its a very frustrating time but theres not a lot I can do about it except keep fit. Grants brother Andy, Henry Olonga, Alistair Campbell and Guy Whittall all quit international cricket around the World Cup. Captain and fast bowler Heath Streaks 55 caps make him by far the most experienced player in the Zimbabwe team named for the first Test. The team is also likely to lean heavily on the relative experience of batsmen Stuart Carlisle, Craig Wishart and Trevor Gripper, left-arm spinner Ray Price and allrounder Andy Blignaut.

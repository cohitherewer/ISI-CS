 BY STAR RACER				 	 Kader				 										Calcutta: Contrary to reports that jockey Aslam Kader may not be able to ride for three months following his fall from a horse last Friday, the jockey is learnt to be recovering fast and may return to the saddle in less than five weeks time, said a Pune source. The last scanning of Kaders injury area indicates hairline fracture and not multiple fractures, said the source. Kaders spine injury was more serious than his shine and toe wounds as the jockey had landed head on after the fall, the source added.

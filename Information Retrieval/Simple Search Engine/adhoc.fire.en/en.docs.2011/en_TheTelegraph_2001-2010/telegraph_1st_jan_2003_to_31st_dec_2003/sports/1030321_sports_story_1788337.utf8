The Telegraph - Calcutta
 You cant have a set plan for Sachin
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Durban: Michael Whispering Death Holding does not need an introduction. And, years after quitting, he continues to be much sought after: By fans and, more important, present-day cricketers. If anything, that confirms the respect Holding (also saluted as the Rolls Royce among fast bowlers) enjoys. Holding, who has been doing TV commentary during the World Cup, spoke to The Telegraph Thursday morning.The following are excerptsOn his impressions about the fast bowlers in this World CupThe ones with class have shown they can get people out... Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Chaminda Vaas, Shane Bond... Basically, they used the conditions well... I hadnt seen much of Bond, leading up to the tournament, but he has the pace and a nice run-up. If he has a fault, its that he doesnt deliver from his full height. Having said that, he still picked so many (17) wickets... In any case, nobody is perfect. ;Holdings cup pick: Lee, Bond and Vaas On whether, overall, he has been satisfied with the quality of fast bowlingVery much so. On whether any one performance stands outBond against Australia (six for 23) in the Super Six... He beat the Aussies with sheer pace, left them devastated. On the relevance of speedYouve got to put the ball in the right place, otherwise speed is irrelevant. Look at Shoaib Akhtar. He bowled the fastest ball (100.23 mph), in Cape Town (versus England), but kept going for runs. It would have been different had he combined that pace with landing in the right area. On his top three fast bowlers in this World CupIll go for Bond, Vaas and Lee... Vaas is the slowest in this lot, but still had the pace to push batsmen back... All three combine control with pace and use their head.On whether the Lee-Shoaib debate has been settled in the formers favourLee has certainly taken more wickets... Ill even accept he has been more effective. However, I dont think the debate has been conclusively settled. After all, Pakistan didnt even make the Super Six and, so, Shoaib got fewer opportunities. In any case, Lee didnt start the tournament with a bang and its possible Shoaib would have improved.On the Indian attackIt has done well, given an edge to your team...On Jawagal Srinath: Doesnt have that pace, but has used his experience, proving to be an example of bowling with common sense. (After a pause) When I last saw him, in the West Indies, he didnt seem interested... He would look away even after getting wickets. Now, he appears rejuvenated. Should he quit? Well, he isnt getting any younger and, if India win the World Cup, it will be an excellent moment to leave. On Ashish Nehra: Ive always liked him... He has good pace and reasonably good control... That he is a left-armer is an advantage and, because he can move the ball both ways, becomes more than a handful. His confidence has grown because the captain is showing more faith. On Zaheer Khan: For him, its a matter of getting control and bowling the right length. Hes not as quick as Nehra, but can move the ball both ways. Bottomline is that hes a wickettaker, quite like Nehra... The captain cant complain.On whether the pitches should have been more livelySome have been good, like at the Wanderers and in Centurion. However, the wickets at Port Elizabeth, specially, were very ordinary... Essentially, in a one-day tournament, you need pitches that encourage strokeplay and give the fast bowlers something to look forward to.On the West Indies future, in the fast bowling departmentJermaine Lawson is very promising and showed that in the game against Kenya... Then, theres Darren Powell... With little experience, theyve been made to play the lead role which, to my mind, is unfair... It would have been better had their initiation been in a stea- dy attack instead of a fluid one. On the West Indies failure to even qualify for the Super SixI dont wish I was there, because there are some I wouldnt have liked playing with... But, yes, it hurts... It pains... Its a matter of waiting, of looking out for that light at the end of the tunnel.On how he would have bowled to Sachin Tendulkar(Laughs) Would have tried to keep him quiet, thereby frustrating him... I wouldnt have had a specific plan, because you cant have one when youre up against a Viv Richards or a Sachin... But, yes, I would have looked for support. After all, no purpose would be served if I kept it tight, but he got easy runs at the other end. Finally, his message to the upcoming generation of fast bowlersWork hard and get stronger... The fitter you are, the better your chances of making an impact...  Copyright

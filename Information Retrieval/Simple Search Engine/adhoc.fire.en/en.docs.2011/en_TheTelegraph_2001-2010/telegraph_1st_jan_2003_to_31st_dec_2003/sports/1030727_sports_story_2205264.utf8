 Pankaj in last eight
Taupo, July 26 (PTI): National champion Pankaj Advani kept Indias medal hopes alive when he pulled a hard-fought 5-4 victory over Tian Pengfei of China to enter the quarter finals of the IBSF world under-21 snooker championship on Saturday. After opening with a brilliant break of 94, Pankaj ran into a fightback from Pengfei. The top-seed led 4-1 at one stage and appeared well set for a comfortable win when the Chinese fought back to take three frames in a row. However, in the deciding frame, Pankaj displayed good composure under pressure and prevailed on the colours for a 94-4, 54-68, 71-0, 81-43, 54-41, 50-60, 39-66, 1-114, 57-34 decision. Pankaj will now take on unseeded Neil Robertson of Australia who upset No. 8 seed Alex Davies of England 5-4. Fifth seed Ding Junhui, Liu Song (sixth seed) and unseeded Li Yinxi also made it to the round of eight.  Copyright

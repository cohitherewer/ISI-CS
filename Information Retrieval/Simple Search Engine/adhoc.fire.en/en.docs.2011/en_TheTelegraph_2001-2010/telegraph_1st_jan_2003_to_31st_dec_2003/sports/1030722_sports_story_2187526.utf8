 Debjit out of danger 
  Debjit Ghosh Jakarta: East Bengals Debjit Ghosh, who suffered a head injury and was in a state of unconsciousness on the ground during the ASEAN Club Championship quarter final versus Persita Tangerang in Jakarta on Monday, was out of danger now, according to Bhaichung Bhutia. Debjit is perfectly alright now. He suffered a head injury and was removed to a hospital, but is normal now and will be discharged from the hospital Tuesday, Bhutia said. Its too early to say whether he will take any further part in the tournament, Bhutia, however, added. An East Bengal official also confirmed that the central midfielder was safe. A CT scan was done on him and he would be discharged soon, he said. The incident took place in the 35th minute. Both Debjit and Persita striker Zaenal Arief jumped for an aerial ball. Ariefs elbow struck the back of Debjits head and both went down in a heap. Initial attention was given to the Indonesian player, but it was soon found that Debjit was unconscious. His teammates rushed in to his rescue and Alvito DCunha, Dipak Mondal and others started pumping his heart. Douglas da Silva even took off his jersey and fanned the unconscious player.East Bengal team doctor Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta and the paramedics also joined in their efforts. Coach Subhas Bhowmick rushed in, looking pretty nervous, giving enough indication that it was, indeed, a bad blow both to the player as well as his team. Debjit was stretchered off and taken to a hospital in an ambulance. Dr Dasgupta and a few other club officials accompanied the player at that time.  Copyright

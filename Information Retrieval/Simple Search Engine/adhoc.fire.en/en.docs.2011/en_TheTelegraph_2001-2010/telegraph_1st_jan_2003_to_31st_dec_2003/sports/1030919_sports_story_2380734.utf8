The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla falter again
 Rajin Saleh in action on Thursday Rawalpindi: Yousuf Youhana scored an unbeaten 94 against Bangladesh to lead Pakistan to five-wicket win with just one ball to spare in the fourth one-day International on Thursday. Youhana hit five fours and one six, to follow scores of 49, 106 and 65 in the first three matches of the series, all of which Pakistan won. His innings kept Bangladesh waiting for their first one-day International win since the 1999 World Cup when they beat Pakistan. Chasing 223 for a victory, Pakistan made 226 for five off 49.5 overs. Since then Bangladesh have lost 41 out of 43 matches, two of them non-results. Bangladesh elected to bat first on Thursday and recovered from a slow start to finish on a respectable 222 for eight in 50 overs. The touring side had slumped to 145 for five before a 49-run sixth-wicket partnership between Tushar Imran and Mushfiqur Rahman helped them add 77 runs from the last 10 overs. Rajin Saleh top-scored with 47 from 92 balls as only 14 boundaries were struck in the innings. Opener Hannan Sarkar (25), Saleh, Habibul Bashar (37) and Imran (33) all looked to be heading for big scores before losing their wickets and the highest partnership was between Bashar and Saleh.

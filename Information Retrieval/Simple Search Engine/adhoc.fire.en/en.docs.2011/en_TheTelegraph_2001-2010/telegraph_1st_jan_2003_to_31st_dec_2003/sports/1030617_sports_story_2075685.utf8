The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latif holds up Miandad model
- Pakistan vs England l New-look sides enter three-match series with point to prove  Captains Michael Vaughan and Rashid Latif with the NatWest Challenge Trophy before nets at Old Trafford Monday. (Reuters)  Manchester: Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has told his batsmen to make Javed Miandad their role model during their forthcoming one-day series against England.Miandad, a world class-batsman for Pakistan from the 1970s to the 1990s, is coaching the team again after their first-round exit at the World Cup and Latif said: We want to play the same as our coach, Javed Miandad, used to by building an innings.Speaking after Pakistans final warm-up match, a five-wicket win over Leicestershire on Saturday, the wicketkeeper added: Here we did well in the first 15 overs but we want to keep wickets in hand and score heavily in the last 10 overs.Pakistan, who start a three-match one-day series against England with a day-night game at Old Trafford on Tuesday, will field a much-changed side from the World Cup.Gone are former captains and legendary pace bowlers Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. Nor is there a place for opening bat Saeed Anwar, off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq.Meanwhile, Shoaib Akhtar will miss Tuesdays match as he completes a two-game ban for ball-tampering.But allrounder Abdul Razzaq, who has been playing for English County Middlesex but was called into the squad on Friday, could feature after taking four wickets against Leicestershire.Latif, however, said he was not expecting too much of his new look side.Im not expecting well win every game, he added. At this moment we are just trying to give our youngsters a chance, trying to fill the slots left by the stars. The captain added that some of the players who shone in warm-up games could be stars of the future.Yasir Hameed is technically very correct. And Mohammed Hafeez, the opener replacing Shahid Afridi, is another good batsman who can be aggressive but also play according to the situation. Hes an off-spinner as well.Latif insisted Pakistan cricket is capable of regaining its place among the elite.After the World Cup, people started saying there was no talent in Pakistan, but I know that is not the case. Look at all the Counties. They are always after our players, he added.When Pakistan last met England at the World cup, Lancashire paceman James Anderson ran through them taking four for 28.Anderson is a good prospect but you cannot judge a player by one game, the Pakistan captain said.England have also built a new-look team with a new man at the helm. Michael Vaughan has replaced Test skipper Nasser Hussain as the one-day captain.Meanwhile, Alec Stewart has also stood down from one-day duty with Chris Read getting a recall. But the Nottinghamshire keeper has a thumb injury and opening batsman Marcus Trescothick could yet don the gloves.However, in a departure from their youth policy, England have recalled veteran paceman Darren Gough.Gough was bullish about his chances of making an impact. Im more accurate than Ive ever been but Im not holding back, said the 32-year-old.THE SQUADEngland (from): Michael Vaughan (capt), Kabir Ali, James Anderson, Rikki Clarke, Andrew Flintoff, Ashley Giles, Darren Gough, Stephen Harmison, James Kirtley, Robert Key, Anthony McGrath , Chris Read, Vikram Solanki, Marcus Trescothick, James Troughton.Pakistan (from): Rashid Latif (capt), Yousuf Youhana, Mohammad Hafeez, Imran Nazir, Yasir Hameed, Younis Khan, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, Bilal Asad, Azhar Mahmood, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Shabbir Ahmad, Umar Gul, Danish Kaneria, Abdul Razzaq.

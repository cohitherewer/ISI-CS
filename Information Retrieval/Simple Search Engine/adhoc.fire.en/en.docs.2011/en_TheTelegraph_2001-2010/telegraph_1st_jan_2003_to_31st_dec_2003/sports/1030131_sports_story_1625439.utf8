		 Friday, January 31, 2003 				 DDCA allows Jadeja only seven overs
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi: Ajay Jadejas dream of getting back to the playing arena received a rude jolt when he was stopped from playing a local league match Thursday by the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA).																								The allrounder, whose five-year ban from playing cricket was lifted three days back, had turned up for for his club, National Stadium Cricket Club (NSCC), at the Yamuna Sports Complex.																								The DDCA officials did not stop him from entering the ground as a member of the playing eleven, but realised it only after seven overs had been bowled. Jadeja was armed with the Delhi High Court appointed arbitrators order of lifting the ban, but it did not help his cause. 																								In fact, the match was abandoned following the controversy and would be replayed at a later date.																								I showed them the court order. But they said I couldnt play. I think there is some misunderstanding about the 90-day period during which BCCI has the right to appeal against the court order. It is not that I cant play during those 90 days, Jadeja said.																								I had turned out for a match after a long time and its definitely sad not to be allowed to do so. I am also sorry for others because the match was abandoned, the all-rounder observed. He felt its not a big issue and will be resolved soon.																								DDCA vice president C. K. Khanna said as per the BCCI decision, Jadeja could play only after three months. BCCI chief Jagmohan Dalmiya said the board was taking legal advice on Delhi High Court appointed arbitrators order and the working committee is scheduled to take a decision and Jadeja has to wait till that time.																								I have spoken to him (Dalmiya) twice and he has assured me Jadeja cant play domestic matches till the final decision, Khanna said.																								Vineet Malhotra, who fought Jadejas case, said the arbitrators order comes into effect immediately and the BCCI cannot overrule it.

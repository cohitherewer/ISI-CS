The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Watch on Zaheer fitness
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Melbourne, Dec. 27: Though quick Zaheer Khan continued to bowl  in short spells  despite the recurrence of a hamstring problem during the day, he is going to be watched and will stay on for the tri-series only if he can last the January 9-February 10 tournament. According to The Telegraphs sources, Zaheer is going to be picked in the 16-man squad, but that wont guarantee his staying back. He will be monitored and, as of now, will return home if theres a chance he may again be troubled, is how a source put it. If Zaheer has to go back, Irfan Pathan should stay on  otherwise, he is going to return home with Sadagopan Ramesh, Deep Dasgupta and Akash Chopra. Their places, one learns, will be taken by Sanjay Bangar, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif and Hemang Badani. The selection will be done tomorrow at 3.00 pm (IST), via a tele-conference featuring captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright at this end.  Copyright

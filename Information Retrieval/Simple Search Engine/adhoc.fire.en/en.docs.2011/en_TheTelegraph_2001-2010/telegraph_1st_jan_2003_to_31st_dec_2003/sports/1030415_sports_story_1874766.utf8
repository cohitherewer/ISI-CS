The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BNR go down
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: BSF North Bengal beat BNR Recreation Club 1-0 in the first division group A action of BHA League on Monday. The unfinished match between Calcutta Port Trust and SAI Training Centre failed to produce any goal. At Mohun Bagan ground, J. Kindo scored the matchwinner for BSF in the 58th minute. However, earlier in the day at the same venue, CPT and SAI failed to break the deadlock as they completed the final 27 minutes that remained from their April 4 match. The match was called off after 43 minutes of action on that day because of bad light. In first division group B action, CLW SA thrashed Wari AC 8-0. Sushil Kindo, A. Toppo, V. Lakra and P. Toppo scored a brace each for the winners. In other matches, Muslim Institute rode a Vim Kumar strike to get past Baranagore SC while BSF South Bengal and Police AC were locked in a goalless truce.

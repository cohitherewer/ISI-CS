 Constantine upbeat 
Jamshedpur, Sept. 6 (PTI): National coach Stephen Constantine on Saturday said the two Indian sides slated to take part in the upcoming under-19 JRD Tata Cup international football meet here had good prospects. He also hoped the tournament would give much-needed match exposure to the talented juniors, ahead of the AFC qualifiers in Malaysia in October. The home teams TFA India Blue and TFA India White would be up against three foreign sides  Bangladesh, Uzbekistan and Iran  in the round-robin invitational tourney beginning in the Steel City from Thursday. Our prospects in the tournament are very good. This competition has come at the right time. It will definitely help our preparations for the AFC qualifiers, Constantine said. Constantine said the purpose of fielding two teams was to give a chance to more youngsters.  Copyright

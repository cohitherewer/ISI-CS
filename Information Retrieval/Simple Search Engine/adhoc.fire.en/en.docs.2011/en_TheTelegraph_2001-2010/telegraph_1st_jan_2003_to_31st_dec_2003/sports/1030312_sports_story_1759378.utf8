The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The difference is in positive attitude:  Arjuna
 - Match-winning pacers... have  brought about a huge change in Indias fortunes FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Johannesburg: Arjuna Ranatunga  had mixed emotions at The Wanderers Monday. On the one hand,  he was pained by Sri Lankas performance, on the other,  he couldnt but appreciate Indias 24-carat display. The difference between this Indian  side and the earlier ones is attitude... Clearly, we were  outplayed in all departments... We just werent good enough.  Also, it didnt help that Sanath (Jayasuriya) put India  in on an excellent batting surface, Ranatunga told The  Telegraph at the Crowne Plaza. Speaking a few hours after Lankas  massive 183-run defeat, he added: The Indians have peaked  at the right time and the presence of match-winning bowlers,  in the pace department, has brought about a huge change...  Earlier, you only had a Kapil Dev. Now, all three (Jawagal  Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra) can win you games. Ranatunga, a Member of Parliament  who is doing TV duty in the World Cup, felt the Indians  have it in them to repeat 1983. Of course, much depends  on how teams play on the day in question, but this Indian  side looks good. A distinctly positive attitude is making  a difference. According to Ranatunga, Sachin  Tendulkars form (a record 571 runs) has contributed immensely,  besides the nature of the wickets. We expected much pace  and bounce but, instead, the wickets have generally been  like the sub-continent... Asked whether he still maintained  Sachin ought not to open, Ranatunga answered: If he is  comfortable, then its immaterial what others think. Had  the wickets been bouncy and quick, I would have iterated  that he shouldnt open... In those conditions, it would  have been foolish sacrificing the No.1 batsman. Ranatunga smiled when reminded  that Sourav Ganguly and John Wright were following his (and  Dav Whatmores) strategy of packing the XI with seven batsmen.  Lankas 1996 World Cup-winning team, it may be recalled,  also had seven (including the keeper). The emergence of match-winning  bowlers notwithstanding, the Indians strength is batting.  And, so, they should continue with seven batters and not  be influenced by conditions into trying something else,  Ranatunga remarked. Incidentally, Ranatunga had praise  for Souravs captaincy. Ive always had the highest regard  for (Mohammed) Azharuddin as captain, but Sourav has matured  and is leading very well. Obviously, he backs his players  and they, in turn, are giving their best. He added: In any case, as issues  keep cropping up  given the diversity in India  it may  not be easy for a captain to keep the side together. Sourav,  though, has been successful... Talking about Srinath, who has  been at his best for the past couple of months, Ranatunga  said: If he is thinking of quitting, then he must be allowed  to take a decision on his own... Actually, its never easy  and its best that the individual alone decides what is  good for him. Ranatunga, however, declined to  offer any advice to Jayasuriyas men. I avoid doing that...  If theres a crisis, then you will find me backing the team,  otherwise I keep my counsel to myself... All isnt lost  and, so, the side should quickly get its act right. Asked whether he would contest  the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka presidentship,  Ranatunga replied in the affirmative. I dont know when  the elections will be called, but Im determined to fight. Having been a winner for much  of his life, its reasonable to assume Ranatunga wont finish  a loser. Copyright

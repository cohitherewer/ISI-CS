 Smith century puts SA in command
Johannesburg: Graeme Smiths powerful century led South Africa to a commanding 368 for three on the first day of the first Test against the West Indies on Friday. Captain Smith scored 132 and Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis and Martin van Jaarsveld cracked half centuries as the hosts completely dominated the opening day of the four-match series. Smith was at the crease for more than four hours, facing 184 balls and hitting 22 fours as he passed 1,500 runs in Tests. Gibbs, who scored 60, and Smith added 149 for the first wicket, a record for South Africa against the West Indies. Kallis was 87 not out at the close with Van Jaarsveld on 69, his maiden Test half-century. (Reuters)  Copyright

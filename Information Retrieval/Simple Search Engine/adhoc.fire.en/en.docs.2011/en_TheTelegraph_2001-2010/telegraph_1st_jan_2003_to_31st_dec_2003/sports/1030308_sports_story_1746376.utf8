 Anand in hunt
 Anand Linares: Viswanathan Anand drew against Vladimir Kramnik of Russia to remain in contention for the title after his ninth match in the Linares Super Grandmasters chess meet Friday. On a day marred by draws, the lead positions remained almost unaltered and Kramnik maintained his half-point advantage over Peter Leko of Hungary. The Russian has six points from ten games, but is likely to lose sole lead when he gets a bye in the next round. Leko is second with 5.5 from nine games. Anand and world No. 1 Garri Kasparov follow him with five points from nine games each. The next round will be crucial for Anand as he plays Teimour Radjabov with white pieces. A victory will probably make him a joint leader and then he can work on a showdown with Kasparov in the final round. With Kasparov having a bye in this round, not much action was expected but Kramnik lit up the proceedings with a valiant attempt to outdo Anand. Playing white the Russian opened with the king pawn and was surprised early by Anands choice of the opening. The players decided to split points after 32 moves. (PTI)  Copyright

 Kale decision deferred
Pune, Dec. 6 (PTI): Additional distict judge B. N. Deshpande today reserved the order for December 12 on Maharashtra cricketer Abhijit Kales case pertaining to BCCIs appeal challenging the lower courts order which allowed him to play Ranji Trophy matches. The court, by its interim order had quashed the lower court order which had stayed BCCIs decision to suspend him and allowed him to play Ranji matches. Kale, who was present in the court, however, refused to speak on the matter saying that he would comment only after the verdict.  Copyright

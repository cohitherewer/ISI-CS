The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England complete clean sweep
Dhaka: Andrew Flintoff cracked his third consecutive half-century as England beat Bangladesh by seven wickets to complete a clean sweep in their three-match one-day International series on Wednesday. The 25-year-old allrounder hammered four fours and four sixes in his explosive 39-ball 52 as England won with more than 10 overs to spare after bowling out Bangladesh for a paltry 182. Flintoff shared an unbroken 83-run stand with Paul Collingwood (46 not out) after Marcus Trescothick had put the visitors on course with a 70-ball 50, his 15th half-century in one-day Internationals. Flintoff, Man of the Match in the first two matches, had earlier grabbed two wickets for 32 as all of Englands bowlers chipped in to bundle out Bangladesh in 49.1 overs. (Reuters)  Copyright

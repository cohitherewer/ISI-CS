The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Beckham opposed boycott
 London: England football captain David Beckham  begged teammate Gary Neville not to lead a boycott of the  sides crucial Euro 2004 qualifier against Turkey in protest  the axing from the squad of Rio Ferdinand, The Sun reported  on Friday.  Meanwhile, an overwhelming majority of supporters  believe the FA was right to ban Ferdinand after he failed  to undergo a drugs test, according to a poll in the tabloid,  Britains biggest selling daily. I need this like a hole in the head, Beckham is said to have told Neville, as the pair argued over the issue.  The two of them had a furious argument, which must  have gone on until two in the morning on Wednesday, a source  close to Beckham was quoted as saying. It was a dramatic  U-turn after Beckham had earlier voted to strike along with  his teammates, the daily said.  David was never happy with the strike call, a source  close to the England team was quoted as saying.  He felt the point had been made that the players  were unhappy at Rios treatment and that they should not  have pushed it as far as they did.  (AFP)  Copyright

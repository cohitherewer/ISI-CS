The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Abbas may be PCB chairman
 Zaheer Abbas Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas was tipped to succeed Tauqir Zia as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman even as speculation mounted on whether an army general or a former cricketer would get the nod for the coveted post. President General Pervez Musharraf, also the patron of PCB, told reporters in Lahore on Saturday he was still to decide on a successor to Zia, who resigned recently. Media reports here said there was intense lobbying by those in the army and influential civil servants to get the post, while Zaheer, regarded as Pakistans greatest batsman, was a frontrunner on account of his non-controversial image and the support he enjoys of Zia. Almost all the sports bodies in the country are currently headed by military officials. Gen. Musharraf said a decision would be made soon while paying glowing tributes to Zia, who he said had contributed a great deal to the development of cricket in Pakistan, specially in terms of infrastructure. Zia surprised everyone by resigning last week citing personal reasons. His resignation came in the midst of open differences between chief selector Aamir Sohail, coach Javed Mindad and captain Inzamam-ul Haq. (PTI)  Copyright

 Srichaphan to defend title
 Srichaphan Chennai: World No. 12 Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand will defend his ATP Tata Open title in January. According to a press release from the tournament sponsors, Srichaphan has confirmed participation in the next edition to be held at the Nungambakkam Stadium here from January 5 to 11. Srichaphan won the crown early this year beating Slovak Karol Kucera in straight sets. This year started off on a great note for me as I won the Tata Open 2003. It was great to win after being runner-up in 2002, the release quoted Srichaphan as saying. I might lose a match but I love to win the crowd. The Chennai spectators are very enthusiastic. It is a pleasure to come back and I hope to retain the title, the release quoted him. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Weirs prize on display
Toronto: US Masters champion Mike Weir was the only man allowed to leave augusta national with his green jacket, and he didnt waste any time showing it off. More than a thousand people showed up at a retail store where Weir, wearing the coat he won Sunday, signed autographs and introduced his new accessories. Later monday, he dropped the ceremonial opening puck at a stanley cup playoff game between the toronto maple leafs and the philadelphia flyers. Augusta national frowns on its champions wearing the green jacket at commercial events, although the club noted that weir had it on just one day after becoming the first canadian and left-hander to win the masters.

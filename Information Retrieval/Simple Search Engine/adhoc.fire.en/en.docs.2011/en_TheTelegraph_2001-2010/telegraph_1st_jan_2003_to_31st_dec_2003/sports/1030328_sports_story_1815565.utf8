The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arcaro posts upset win 
  BY STAR RACER Vijay Singh Calcutta: The Deepak Khaitan-owned duo of Arcaro and Acceptor had the full measure of a strongly fancied Daniel David-ward Smart Ruler in RWITC Cup at the RCTC Thursday. Cristopher Alford partnered a well-tuned Vijay Singh-trainee to victory. However, the afternoon was ruled by the two MAM Ramaswamy trainers  Daniel and his former deputy Errol Bhungard  who led in a brace of winners apiece with jockey Amyn Merchant lending a helping hand on three of them. However, it was Md. Amil who booted home Imperial Pearl for Daniel in the Grand Annual.RESULTS1. Yerevan Cup 2,000m: (3-4-1-6) Discomatic (Merchant) 1; Royal City (Asghar) 2; Automatic (C.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sourav fitness test tomorrow
 BY OUR STAFF REPORTERS Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly will have to pass a fitness test before the start of Tuesdays tri-series final for a groin strain suffered during the match against New Zealand in Hyderabad on Saturday. He appears to be in some pain but is recovering fast. He will undergo a fitness test on the day of the match, informed BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who met the Indian skipper during the day. Sourav had a few sessions with team physio Andrew Leipus after reaching the city in the morning. Leipus later told The Telegraph: He has pain in his left groin but is recovering quite well. The physio was optimistic he will play in the final. The final assessment, however, is awaited. Sourav had to bat with a runner in the latter part of his innings and was also off the field during the visitors reply.

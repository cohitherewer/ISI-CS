The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Future like a wilderness, writes Cathy Freeman
Brisbane: Australias track queen Cathy Freeman is considering living overseas for a few years to escape the pressures of her celebrity high profile at home. The Sydney Olympics 400m champion revealed in her autobiography launched here on Sunday that the pressures she was experiencing were overwhelming. Freeman, 30, who retired from athletics in July, said the future for her was like a wilderness. Im not sure exactly what Ill be doing or where Ill be, she says in the book Cathy: Her Own Story. Im considering living overseas for a few years just to take stock of my life and get away from being the public Cathy Freeman. Freeman says in her book the public is still touched by her performance under extreme pressure winning gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. I cant believe they feel this way about me, she said. The Freeman book also delves into her complex private life including her recently broken marriage to Sandy Bodecker. The issues for her being a young black female growing up in a predominantly white Australia also dominate the book. Freeman, speaking at the book launch on Sunday, said she was angered, disappointed and disillusioned by the latest drug scandal to rock world athletics with many stars linked to a company which manufactured the steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG). I still like to feel that there are more athletes like myself when I was competing than these guys who would say no to drugs, she said.  (AFP)  Copyright

 North Korea, China in final
Bangkok: China will meet North Korea in the final of the AFC womens championship after they beat South Korea 3-1 at the Rajamangala Stadium on Thursday evening. North Korea have thus qualified for the womens World Cup in the US later this year, whether or not they win Saturdays final. South Korea now face Japan, who earlier lost 0-3 to North Korea, in the third/fourth play-off before the final. Whoever wins that game will qualify for the World Cup, while the losers will meet Mexico in a play-off for a berth.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

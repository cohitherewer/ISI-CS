 Rameez may resign 
Islamabad: The appointment of former diplomat Sheharyar Khan as new chairman of PCB could lead to major changes in top administrative posts. The outgoing chairman of the PCB Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia had asked PCB chief executive Rameez Raja and other top officials appointed by him to resign to enable Sheharyar Khan to reconstitute the board. Sheharyar, who was directly appointed by President Pervez Musharraf following Zias resignation, was expected to take over his new office by December 14. The News said Rameez and treasurer Muhammad Naeem have assured Zia that they would submit their resignations to Sheharyar when he takes charge. As far as Rameez and Naeem are concerned they have assured Zia they will tender their resignations as being honorary nominations on the board they understood that the new chairman would like to have his own people in the two key positions, the daily quoted PCB officials as saying. Sheharyar, however, could ask them to continue in their positions, at least until the Indian cricket teams tour of the country early next year. But, Zahid Bashir, marketing director, who was also appointed by Zia, has refused to resign, the newspaper said.  Copyright

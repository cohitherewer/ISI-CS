 Counsel slams Madhavan
Hyderabad: Disgraced India captain Mohammed Azharuddins counsel P. Jagdish slammed former CBI director K. Madhavan and accused him of dancing to the tunes of the BCCI which he said had made up its mind to disqualify his client. On Wednesday, in the second day of hearings in the suit filed by Azharuddin, Jagdish alleged Madhavan, who was entrusted by the BCCI to conduct an inquiry, that he had no understanding about the basics of the game. The counsel said Madhavan was chosen by the former BCCI president A. C. Muthiah because he was willing to play into his hands. He was literally dancing to the tunes of the BCCI which was predetermined to disqualify Azharuddin.  (PTI)  Copyright

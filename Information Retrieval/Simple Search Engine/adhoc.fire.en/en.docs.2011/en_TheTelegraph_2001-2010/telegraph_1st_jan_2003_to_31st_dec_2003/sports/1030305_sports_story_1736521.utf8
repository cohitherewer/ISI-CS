The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Consolation win for West Indies
 Chanderpaul and Gayle (119) in Kimberley Tuesday. (AFP) Kimberley: West Indies ended their disappointing World Cup campaign with an emphatic 142-run win over Kenya on Tuesday that made a mockery of the African teams qualification for the Super Sixes. Opening batsman Chris Gayle smashed 119 off 151 balls to help West Indies amass a respectable total of 246 for seven in the Group B match before the Caribbean bowlers demolished the Kenyans for a miserable 104 inside 36 overs. Vasbert Drakes captured career-best figures of five for 33 including three wickets in eight balls, and Jermaine Lawson took two wickets on his first appearance of the tournament, at times bowling in excess of 150 kmph. The Kenyan batting was hopelessly ill-equipped to deal with the ferocity of the West Indian quicks, with only Peter Ongondo, who top-scored with 24 late in the innings, showing any real resistance. The match could not have been more one-sided but the result still had no effect on the competition with the West Indies, world champions in 1975 and 1979, missing out on the second round by just two points. Kenya went through with 10 carry-over points, second only to defending champions Australia who have 12. The West Indies could easily rue their misfortune, they lost two certain points when their match against Bangladesh was washed out by rain.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

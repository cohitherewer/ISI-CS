The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Technically not my best, says Richardson
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Chandigarh: Technically, I dont rate my innings  very highly... However, from the teams perspective, it  has lots of value... Thats how New Zealand opener Mark  Richardson assessed his career-best 145 in the Mohali Test.  Richardson, who grew up idolising John Wright, added:  Actually, its nice that my highest score is versus India  and not Bangladesh... His previous best, 143, came in Hamilton  (2001-2002). Asked by The Telegraph whether he had been able to interact with Wright for some length of time, Richardson answered: Not yet... Perhaps, that will come about on the last day of the series... In any case, given the way I batted, I wont have many insights to offer from my side...  But, then, as Richardson himself emphasised, its  important to ride your luck. As he said: At the international  level, nothing is easy.  Copyright

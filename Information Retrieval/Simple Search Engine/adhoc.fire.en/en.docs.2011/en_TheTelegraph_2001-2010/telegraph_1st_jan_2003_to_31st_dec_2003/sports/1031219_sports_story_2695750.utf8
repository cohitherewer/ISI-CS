The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Brett Lee raring to spew fire
	 - Speedster will be under pressure on comeback: Sourav  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Hobart: With Glenn McGrath out and a question  mark over Jason Gillespie, Australia will definitely be  looking to tearaway Brett Lee for a demolition job in the  two Tests that remain. Lee, away from international cricket  for two months owing to an abdominal injury and corrective  (ankle) surgery, is just waiting to be unleashed.  Of course, chief selector Trevor Hohns and his colleagues  must first pick him in the squad for the third Test (Melbourne,  from December 26)  only, as already reported in these columns,  thats a certainty. Lee himself is aware of that and Thursdays papers have devoted much space to everything he said a day earlier, in Sydney. Ill be in the team to bowl fast and, if I get that chance on Boxing Day, thats what Im going to try and achieve, is one quote given a real splash. Thats not all, though. Ill just bowl the way I have been doing for the last couple of years... The MCG (venue of his successful Test debut) has a wicket that has a fair bit in it... I think it could have more life and be conducive to fast bowlers, is something else he pointed out. Lee made his first-class comeback against Victoria over the weekend and, now, is ready for New South Wales next Pura Cup match  versus Tasmania, from Friday. The speed merchants maiden Test appearance, it may be recalled, was against India on the last tour (1999-2000) and he bagged five for 47 in innings No. 1 itself. Since then, however, he has undergone elbow surgery, besides being laid low with injuries. Yet, in the World Cup, he was much too hot for Team India and appears to hold a psychological edge. The captain, though, doesnt agree.  Look, whatever Lee has done in  the past, he will be under pressure on his comeback... In  fact, given that we are batting well, we only need to continue  with our normal game. We dont have to return to the drawing  board, Sourav told The Telegraph with customary  confidence. Meanwhile, Australias captain-designate Ricky Ponting has reacted sharply to Souravs remark (after the Adelaide Test) that a series victory would allow India a claim on the No. 1 label. They have got the side to be (No. 1); they are a good team... But, theres a long way to go... If they think they can become world champions after winning one Test, well, good luck to them... has been his response.  Clearly, Punter Ponting isnt putting any of his  dollars on Team India.

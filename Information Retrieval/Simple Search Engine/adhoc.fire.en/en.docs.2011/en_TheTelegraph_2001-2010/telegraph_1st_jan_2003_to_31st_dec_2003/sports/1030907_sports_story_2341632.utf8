 Fleming expects a tit-for-tat from India
New Delhi, Sept. 6 (PTI): Anticipating a tit-for-tat response, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming on Saturday said his cricket team has the character to take up the challenge even if India prepared spin-friendly tracks for the upcoming Test series. There seems to be a real determination from India to make it as hard as possible for us, after what happened here (in New Zealand) last summer. If thats the case well respond pretty well because theres a lot of character within the side, Fleming was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald website. Though Fleming, who returned home on Friday after finishing a stint with County side Yorkshire, expects the tour to be tough, he cited the success in the West Indies and Sri Lanka as evidence of the teams growing ability to be a threat on foreign soil.

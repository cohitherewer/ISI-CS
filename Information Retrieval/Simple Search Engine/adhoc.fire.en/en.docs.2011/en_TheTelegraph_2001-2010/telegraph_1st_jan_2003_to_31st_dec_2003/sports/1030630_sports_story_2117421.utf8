 Kallis 2nd ton helps SA win
- Tri-series tie vs Zimbabwe Douglas Hondo traps South Africa skipper Graeme Smith lbw for seven in Canterbury Sunday. (Reuters) Canterbury: Jacques Kallis second hundred in two days was the cornerstone of South Africas 272 for five against Zimbabwe in the tri-series one-day International here on Sunday.South Africa restricted Zimbabwe to 226 for nine, thus winning by 46 runs.Kallis career-best 125 not out, his 10th one-day International hundred, came just 24 hours after his 107 in South Africas six wicket defeat by England at The Oval on Saturday, the Proteas first game of the tournament.Fast bowler Douglas Hondo, in for Gary Brent after missing Zimbabwes four-wicket series opening win against England on Thursday with a knee injury, led the attack with two for 29. Andrew Hall (56) partnered Kallis in a fourth-wicket stand of 91 in 88 balls.The innings ended in controversy when, in the last over, Zimbabwe pace bowler Andy Blignaut was ordered out of the attack by the umpires, with one-ball remaining, for bowling his second full toss above waist height.Hondo, who curiously was not given his full quota of overs, bowled the last ball.Kallis faced 147 balls including one six and 14 fours but did have five escapes. He would have been run out on 16 or 35 if either of Zimbabwe captain Heath Streaks throws had hit. Kallis was also dropped, off a low caught and bowled chance by Hondo, on 21 and, on 60, bowler Grant Flower failed to gather Sean Ervines accurate throw with Kallis short of safety.And in the last over he was dropped on the boundary by Hondo on 114 off Blignaut.

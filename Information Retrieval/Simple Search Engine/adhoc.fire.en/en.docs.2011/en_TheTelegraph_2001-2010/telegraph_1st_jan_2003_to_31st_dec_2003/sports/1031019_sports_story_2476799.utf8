The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Umar takes Pak to 275/4
 - First Test - Boucher completes 250 catches
 Taufeeq Umar pulls on way to his century in Lahore on Saturday. (Reuters) Lahore, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Taufeeq Umars fourth Test hundred and a gritty 49 from debutant Asim Kamal on Saturday put Pakistan in a strong position on the second day of the first Test against South Africa. Taufeeqs second successive hundred against South Africa and Kamals innings from 119 balls took Pakistan to 275 for four just 45 runs short of the South African first innings total of 320. Kamal, the eighth player to make his Test debut for Pakistan this home season, and Shoaib Malik (27) also saw off the second new ball taken at the total of 223 for four. They had completed an unbeaten stand of 52 runs at the close. Taufeeq whose previous innings against South Africa was 135 in Cape Town in the second Test last January, was out after facing 247 balls and batting for 322 minutes, hitting 16 fours. His innings laid the foundation for Pakistans strong reply. Taufeeq produced Pakistans best opening stand of 109 runs against South Africa with Imran Farhat 41 and another 63 from 149 balls with Kamal, who survived a close leg-before appeal on his first ball from Andre Nel. Taufeeq has now scored 391 runs in five innings against South Africa at an average of 78. He played with confidence and fluency in his comeback innings after being forced to miss the recent series against Bangladesh and the one-day series against South Africa with a knee injury. When he was out after tea caught and bowled by spinner Paul Adams, skipper Graeme Smith immediately took the second new ball as he sorely missed a second spinner on a slow pitch. Although he was very watchful in defence, Kamal played the best shot of the day, a nonchalant pull off Pollock to mid-wicket for a six. South Africa had just one wicket before lunch when Adams bowled Farhat.  Copyright

 Venus, Safin pull out
New York: Former champion Venus Williams has withdrawn from the US Open with a lingering stomach muscle injury, according to a statement from her representatives on Friday. She joins her younger sister Serena, who beat her in last years final at Flushing Meadows. I kept thinking I would be able to compete, said the world No. 5 in the statement. Unfortunately, it just wasnt meant to be. Venus sustained the injury at a tournament in Poland in April and also withdrew from the French Open in June. Meanwhile, former mens champion Marat Safin of Russia has also withdrawn because of a lingering wrist injury, according to the United States Tennis Associations (USTA) website. Argentine Guillermo Canas also pulled out after undergoing surgery on a wrist injury, the USTA reported.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

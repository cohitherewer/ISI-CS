 Salvi, Badani shine 
 - INDIA A IN ENGLAND l Skippers call off tie as a draw  Salvi (4/92), prompted SAs tail-end collapse Arundel: South Africas final warm-up match before Thursdays first Test against England at Edgbaston ended in a draw against India A on the final day of three. India A were 160 for three in their second innings here Monday  a lead of 16  in reply to South Africas first innings 463 when the captains agreed on a draw with half an hours play remaining. Hemang Badani was 58 not out off 85 balls including one six and eight fours. Ambati Rayudu was unbeaten on four. Earlier, on a pitch whose docility always made a draw the most likely outcome, Test batsman Wasim Jaffer made 54 to add to his first innings 90 before he was caught and bowled by left-arm spinner Robin Peterson. He faced 93 balls including nine fours. Together with Badani he added 101 runs. That stand ended South Africa hopes of victory after theyd established a first innings lead of 144 and then reduced India A to 36 for two. Former South African skipper Shaun Pollock took the first wicket to fall when he had India A captain Shiv Sunder Das (15) playing on after he tried to cut a ball that was too close to him. Monde Zondeki struck next when he had left-hander Gautam Gambhir (18) caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. Earlier India A pace bowler Aavishkar Salvi, who finished with four for 92, prompted a tail-end slide that saw three wickets lost for no runs in seven balls. Left-arm quick Irfan Pathan Jr also chipped in with three for 83, ending the innings after lunch when he caught and bowled Makhaya Ntini off a top-edged hook for five. But South Africa, who resumed on 342 for five, put on 113 in the first session with Pollock, Boeta Dippenaar and Peterson all making thirties. Although the match was meandering towards a draw, Dippenaars innings had meaning for the Free State right-hander. With Jacques Kallis still back at home in South Africa with his terminally ill father, Dippenaar looked increasingly likely to be playing in the Test at Edgbaston. But on 37 he got himself out turning Salvi straight to square leg. He had faced 97 balls including six fours and left the crease with South Africa at 445 for seven. Together with Peterson he had added 51. Three balls later Salvi had Dewald Pretorious caught behind for nought by wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel. Peterson, who like fellow left-arm spinner Paul Adams is unlikely to play on an Edgbaston pitch not known for assisting slow bowlers, fell next. He made 32 including seven fours before he was caught in the gully by India A captain Shiv Sunder Das off Pathan. (AFP )  Copyright

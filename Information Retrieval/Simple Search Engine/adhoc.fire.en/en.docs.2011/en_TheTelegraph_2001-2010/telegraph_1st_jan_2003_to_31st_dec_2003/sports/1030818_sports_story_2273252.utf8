		 Monday, August 18, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Brno (Czech Republic): Qatar has been added to the 2004 world motorcycling Grand Prix (Moto GP) calendar bringing the number of races to seventeen, the FIM said on Sunday. 				 																																	In their provisional calendar released for next season the FIM also noted that the season-opening Japanese Grand Prix scheduled for April 4 at Suzuka was still to be confirmed. 				 																																	The Qatar race will take place on October 2 with a track due to be built on the outskirts of Doha and financed by the huge income the government enjoys from its oil and natural gas reserves. 				 																																	Singapore: A former Malaysian striker collapsed and died on the football pitch of an apparent heart failure five minutes after the match had started, a local newspaper reported on Sunday.				 																																	Ali Bakar, 56, who was playing for the Malaysian ex-internationals against the ex-Singapore Sultan Gold Cup veterans in a charity match on Saturday, collapsed holding his chest in pain as he was about to pass the ball to a teammate, the paper said. 				 																																	Efforts to revive him failed and the match was called off.				 																																	The death came as a big shock because Ali was his usual merry self, laughing and joking before the match, said Peter Jalal, one of the match organisers. He said arrangements were being made to fly Alis body back to Penang for burial.				 																																	London: England coach Sven Goran Eriksson has left Evertons teenage star Wayne Rooney out of his squad for Wednesdays friendly against Croatia. Rooney is still not match-fit after suffering ankle ligament damage, although he came on as a second half substitute in Evertons 1-2 loss to Arsenal on Saturday. 				 																																	THE SQUAD  Goalkeepers: David James, Paul Robinson, Chris Kirkland. Defenders: Danny Mills, Wayne Bridge, Ashley Cole, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, Phil Neville, Sol Campbell, Jonathan Woodgate.

London: Olympic heptathlon gold medallist Denise Lewis of Britain confirmed on Sunday that she would compete at the world championships, which begin in Paris next weekend. 				 																																	Although Lewis was selected at the end of July it was not certain that the two-time world silver medallist would compete. 				 																																	After finishing second and gaining the world championships qualifying standard in the European Cup of Combined Events at the beginning of July, she suffered a bout of sickness. But after setting up a training camp a fortnight ago on the outskirts of Berlin with controversial former East German coach Ekkart Arbeit, Lewis said she was fit to compete.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3-in-a-row for Qureshi
New Delhi, Nov. 29 (PTI): Pakistans Aisam ul-Haq Qureshi won his third singles title in a row defeating top seeded Harsh Mankad 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in the final of the $10,000 ITF Futures meet at the DLTA Complex on Saturday. Qureshis win here followed his earlier victories in Thailand and Dehra Dun. It was also a double delight for the 23-year-old as he had won the doubles title Friday with Mankad. He walked away with $1300 and 16 ATP points. It feels good. My parents have come down to watch me play. So this has been a very satisfying.  Copyright

 WICB sorry for jumping the gun
 King: Theres a lot of angst Sydney: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) Wednesday apologised to the Australian Cricket Academy head coach Bennett King for prematurely announcing his name as the coach of the national cricket team. I spoke to them this morning over phone about my disappointment regarding some of the processes and another couple of issues that are a little more personal and that may come to light later, King said from Adelaide. They apologised for the confusion and expressed regret for using the word appointed in their announcement. King, who had applied for the position last December and appeared in an interview in early March, was Tuesday told the job was his and the media had been informed. But no official appointment offer had been made and no terms and conditions agreed with him. King said the WICB wants him to start the job in the Caribbean in the first week of July after they replace Roger Harper following a disastrous World Cup campaign. Former Windies star Gus Logie is serving as interim coach for this months home series against Australia. King said before taking any decision about the new post, he would discuss it with his wife and three children this weekend. Any adventure is initially exciting, particularly with up and moving, but I know there will be a lot of trepidation down the track, he said. Theres a lot of angst, and nervousness bordering on fear. McGrath to return Premier fast bowler Glenn McGrath will return home from Australias tour of the West Indies to be with his ill wife, the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) said Wednesday. The ACB said McGrath was granted leave to return home after he received medical advice about his wife, Jane, Wednesday. The ACB said it could not yet say how long McGrath would be home and whether a replacement player would be required. The board said more details were expected to be known within the next 48 hours. McGrath was scheduled to leave London for Australia Wednesday and said through the ACB that he will not be available to speak to the media upon his arrival in Sydney.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Well give it our all, says Bhupathi
New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi has put the disappointment of the French Open behind him. On Thursday, a confident Bhupathi declared his partner and he will give it all we have at Wimbledon, beginning Monday. We are going in as favourites and we will give it all we have, Bhupathi said from Nottingham, the venue of the final tune-up event for the All England Championships. Bhupathi and Mirnyi, who lost to Leander Paes and David Rikl in the quarter finals at Roland Garros, have been top seeded at the years only grasscourt Grand Slam. Bhupathi predicted no easy matches over the next two weeks. There are definitely a few tough teams, Jonas Bjorkman-Todd Woodbridge, the Bryan brothers, and Knowles-Nestor. All of them have a lot of experience on grass. We will take one match at a time, he said. A million each at Open Meanwhile, singles winners at the US Open will each earn $1 million, the largest pay checks in Grand Slam history. The higher prizes will be part of a general USTA increase of almost $1 million, from $16.17 million last year. It also includes a record $400,000 to the winners of the doubles events. The increase to record levels reaffirms our commitment to top singles and doubles players who make the two weeks of the US Open the showcase event for tennis in the US, USTA president Alan Schwartz said. The purse for Wimbledon this year will be about $15.7 million, the mens winner getting about $964,000 and womens winner nearly $897,000. Juan Carlos Ferrero earned $983,000 for winning the French Open, while Justine Henin-Hardenne pocketed $958,000. (Agencies)  Copyright

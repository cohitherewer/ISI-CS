(AFP)																								Madrid: Holders Deportivo La Coruna breezed into the last eight of the Kings Cup with a 4-1 win over third division Alicante at the Riazor on Wednesday.																								The win gave the Galicians a comfortable 5-2 aggregate victory over the Mediterranean side which never really threatened to repeat its impressive performance of the first leg. Deportivo grabbed an early lead against Alicante when Paraguayan international Robert Acuna drilled in from 20 metres out after fellow midfielder Victor had headed a neat pass into his path on five minutes.																								Deportivo scored again on the stroke of halftime with a coolly taken strike from winger Jose Emilio Amavisca who slotted home with the outside of his foot. 																								Tristan added a third when he cracked home a 58th minute penalty after Albert Luque was barged off the ball by defender Cristian Green. Fellow striker Luque wrapped up a comfortable 4-1 win when he scored with a precise curling shot after he latched on to a fine pass from Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva seven minutes from time. The shock of the round came from Murcia who claimed a 2-1 victory at first division Alaves. The second division side, which thrashed Las Palmas 6-1 at the weekend to move into second place in the table, booked its place in the quarters thanks to second-half strikes from David Karanka and Josep Setvalls.																								First division basement club Recreativo Huelva also produced an upset when a late strike from Raul Molina allowed them to overturn high-flying Real Betis with a 1-0 aggregate victory.																								Real Mallorca forward Carlos grabbed a first half hattrick in his sides 4-1 thrashing of Valladolid in the other all-first division tie.Cup experts Atletico Madrid flattered to deceive with 3-0 win over Bernd Schusters Xerez. Xerez, who failed to convert a second-half penalty, had the better of the play for much of the match, but Atletico made the most of some impressive finishing. Javi Moreno ended his recent goal drought with two well-taken individual goals and midfielder Carlos Aguilera weighed in with a powerful header. (REUTERS)

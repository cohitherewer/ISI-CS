 Pakistan withdraw from Asia Cup
Karachi: Pakistan dashed hopes of a revival in cricketing ties with India after announcing their withdrawal from the Asia Cup in Colombo, a top cricket board official said here Monday. We have informed the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) of our inability to participate in the Asia Cup and will issue further details next week, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director Chishty Mujahid said. The PCB took the decision after India refused to tour Pakistan for a Test and one-day series scheduled for April-May this year. Pakistan had earlier said they will not tour India in 2004. The ACC had planned to hold the event in August after Pakistan withdrew as hosts. Apart from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and two associate members of the ACC  Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates  were due to participate in the event. The last time both countries played together in the Asia Cup was in Bangladesh in May-June 2000. Since then Pakistan and India have met just once, during the World Cup in South Africa last month. No Indian team has toured Pakistan since 1997-98 while Pakistan toured India in 1998-99.  (AFP)  Copyright

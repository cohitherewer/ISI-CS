The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jeev holds on to lead on Day II
 - Delhi meet Atwal tied for fifth place  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Jeev is glad to be chased by countrymen Calcutta: Ace golfer Jeev Milkha Singh shot a level-par round on Day II, but still managed to hold on to the lead in the $300,000 Hero Honda Masters, the 14th leg of the Asian PGA Tour, being played at the par-72 Delhi Golf Club, on Friday. Jeev, who shot a six-under 66 on the opening day, tallied six-under 138 at the halfway stage, thus enjoying a one-stroke advantage over the Indian trio of Vijay Kumar, Digvijay Singh and Pappan, who were tied for the second place at five-under 139, according to information received here. Current Order of Merit leader Arjun Atwal shot a round of one-under 71 and was tied for the fifth place along with Jaiveer Virk of India and Anthony Kang of Korea at four-under 140. Asias No 1 golfer in 2002, Jyoti Randhawa, Sanya Open winner Marcus Both and multiple winner of Asian PGA Tour, Gerry Norquist of USA were among four tied for eight at three-under 141. The cut was applied at four-over 148. As many as 73 players made it to the money-making rounds. This included 35 Indian professionals and two amateurs  Harinder Gupta and Vikrant Chopra. Jeev started from the 10th tee. His round comprised three birdies  on the 18th, first and ninth. It also included three bogeys  on the 13th, 16th and seventh. He finished off in style though, a brilliant six-iron second shot landing to three feet from the pin. I have no complains about my ball striking today. However, unlike yesterday, my putts just did not drop. It gets a lot tougher playing in the afternoon as the greens dry up. It will be an interesting battle over the next two days and I am really glad to see three of my countrymates chasing me,said the 32-year-old.  Copyright

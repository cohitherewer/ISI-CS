 Schuettler topples Agassi
 - Montreal Masters | German to meet Nalbandian in semis,  Federer to take on Roddick
 Rainer Schuettler celebrates beating Andre Agassi in the quarter finals of the Montreal Masters on Friday. The German won 2-6, 6-2, 6-3. (Reuters) Montreal, Aug. 9 (Reuters): German eighth seed Rainer Schuettler battled to a revenge win over Andre Agassi as he rallied from a set down to beat the world No. 1 2-6, 6-2, 6-3 in the quarter finals of the ATP Masters meet in Montreal on Friday. In the semi-finals, Schuettler takes on Argentinas David Nalbandian who eased to a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Spains Feliciano Lopez. The pair joined Roger Federer and Andy Roddick in the last four, who earlier recorded straight-set victories to set up an intriguing contest between two of the sports most popular young players. In a rematch of the Australian Open final, Schuettler was able to turn the tables on Agassi and resisted the Americans baseline assaults with brilliant cross-court passing shots. After a poor opening set, Schuettler picked up his level of play in the second to take his first-ever set off Agassi for the loss of just two games. Inspired by his success, the 27-year-old German sent Agassi scurrying round the court in the third set, which he closed out for an upset victory. Agassi had crushed Shuettler in three quick sets in their last meeting in Australia to claim his eighth Grand Slam title, but he felt powerless on Friday. He just got the better of me, he made me miss a few shots and then stepped up on the big points, Agassi said. Agassi, who was the top seed of the Cincinnati Masters next week, announced that he was pulling out of the event after his defeat to Schuettler. I feel like I have had enough matches so Im just going to go freshen up and train a little bit and get myself energetic for the Open, the two-time winner in New York said. Federer breezed past doubles partner Max Mirnyi 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) to set up a Wimbledon rematch against Roddick. The third seeded Swiss played flawless tennis against his Belarussian opponent, who never came close to breaking the Wimbledon champions serve. To mark his 22nd birthday, Federer received a racket-shaped cake from tournament organisers after notching his 57th win of the season, the most on the mens circuit. The Swiss is poised to become the new leader of the ATP Champions Race after second seed Juan Carlos Ferrero lost in the third round against Karol Kucera.  Copyright

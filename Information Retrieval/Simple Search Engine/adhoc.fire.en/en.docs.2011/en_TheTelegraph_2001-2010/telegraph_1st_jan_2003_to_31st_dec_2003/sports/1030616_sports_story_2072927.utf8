Milan: Son of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi will start training for Serie A team Perugia from July 1 paving the way for a possible transfer, the club said on Sunday. Italian media had reported that Perugia were keen on signing Al-Saadi Gaddafi, who owns and plays for the Tripoli club Al-Ittihad and was named Libyan Striker of the Year in 2001. He is also a shareholder and sits on the board of Juventus and last year signed a lucrative co-operation deal with Rome club Lazio. In a statement on its website, Perugia said that Al-Saadi, Perugias coach Serse Cosmi, the clubs president Luciano Gaucci and chief executive Alessandro Gaucci agreed that Gaddafi junior would attend training before they make a final decision about his playing future.

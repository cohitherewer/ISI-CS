The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lehmann ruled out, Gillespie still uncertain
Sydney: Injured Darren Lehmann was overlooked and Jason Gillespie included subject to a fitness test in the 14-member Australian squad announced on Wednesday for the tri-series beginning in India on October 23. The fitness of Gillespie, who suffered an injury during the first Test against Zimbabwe, will be assessed before the teams departure on October 22. If the fast bowler fails to pass the fitness test, his place would go to Brad Williams, national selection panel chairperson Trevor Hohns said. We know this tour will be a tough assignment as India and New Zealand are two very capable one-day sides. Despite this, we feel that we have the depth necessary to get us through the tournament, Hohns said. Others picked in the squad after having missed some of Australias recent assignments include Nathan Bracken, Michael Clarke and Jimmy Maher. The tour will see Australia play a total of six matches against India and New Zealand with the possibility of a final in Calcutta. Lehmann was also ruled out of the second Test against Zimbabwe starting on Friday, his place going to Clarke. Left-arm paceman Bracken has been included in the squad for the first time since the World Cup where he replaced the injured Gillespie.

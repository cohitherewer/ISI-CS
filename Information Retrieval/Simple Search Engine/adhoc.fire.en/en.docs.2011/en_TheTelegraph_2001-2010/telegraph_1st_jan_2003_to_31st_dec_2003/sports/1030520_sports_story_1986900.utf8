 SA ignore Klusener again
Johannesburg: Allrounder Lance Klusener was left out of both the South African one-day and Test squads on Monday for their forthcoming tour to England. The UCBSA named two squads of 16 players for the Tests and 17 for the ODIs. Klusener was also ignored from the list of 20 who got a one-year contract. The decision could signal the end of his international career after he recently said that he would be gone before the dust could settle if he failed to receive a new deal.  The mantle of ODI vice-captaincy is back with Mark Boucher. the SQUADS TESTS: Graeme Smith (captain), Herschelle Gibbs, Gary Kirsten, Jacques Rudolph, Jacques Kallis, Neil McKenzie, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini, Paul Adams, Charl Willoughby, Boeta Dippenaar, Thami Tsolekile, Robin Peterson, Dewald Pretorius, Monde Zondeki. ODIs: Graeme Smith, Mark Boucher (vice captain), Paul Adams, Nicky Boje, Alan Dawson, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Jacques Kallis, Charl Langeveldt, Neil McKenzie, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Dewald Pretorius, Jacques Rudolph, Martin van Jaarsveld, Morne van Wyk.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barreto expected before derby
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Jose Ramirez Barreto Calcutta: The wait for Jose Ramirez Barreto, Mohun Bagans Brazilian star, seems to be over, at least for the moment. According to sources in the club, he is likely to be back by Monday. Weve already sent the requisite papers and the ticket. We expect him to be back in the city before we take on East Bengal on July 5, a Mohun Bagan official said. However, the officials are still not sure how the money (no small amount, mind you) for the star will be organised. Still, nothing has worked out on that front. We hope itll be cleared once the player is back in town, the official added. Of the promised Rs 51 lakh, just four lakh as advance has been cleared. Keeping the return of Barreto in mind, the Mohun Bagan officials had asked their match against Tollygunge Agragami on July 1 to be deferred to a date after the Derby. According to IFA rules, if Barreto returns by Monday, he cannot be registered before July 1, thereby missing the Tollygunge game. However, they didnt give any specific reason for requesting the game to be rescheduled. We are sending them a letter asking for reasons why they want the postponement, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said. He added if the reasons are valid enough, the IFA will sit down with Tollygunge authorities and take a final decision on the issue. EB game deferred Meanwhile, East Bengals match against Ever-Ready Association, scheduled for Thursday, has been postponed. The National League champions had asked for the postponement of two of their games, against Ever Ready and Wari AC (on Monday), so that their preparations for the ASEAN Cup in Indonesia is not hampered. Since East Bengal are representing the country, we decided to accept their request, the IFA secretary said. However, the game against Wari wont be postponed, because it will be too tight to reschedule one more game with the Federation Cup getting off on July 26. The ASEAN Cup starts on June 14, though East Bengals departure date hasnt been finalised.  Copyright

 							 - SAfF Cup l Ashim Biswas, DCunha net a brace each				 	 Ashim Biswas dodges Afghanistans Nasir Ahmad on way to scoring one of his two goals in the SAFF Cup match in Dhaka Sunday. India won 4-0. (AFP) 																								Dhaka: After a disappointing defeat in their opening match of the third SAFF Cup, India returned to form with an empathic 4-0 victory against Afghanistan at the Bangabandhu National Stadium here Sunday.																								India, who suffered a shock 0-1 loss against Pakistan on Friday, made light work of Afghanistan with Ashim Biswas and Alvito DCunha scoring a brace each. 																								Pakistan continued their dream run with another fine victory  this time over Sri Lanka. The 2-1 triumph made Pakistan the first team to book a berth in the semi-finals. 																								Ashim Biswas opened Indias account in the 30th minute, tapping a Jo Paul Ancheri back header from a close distance. It was the first international goal for the young Tollygunj Agragami striker, who made his debut only in the previous match. 																								The 19-year-old also scored the second goal in the 63rd minute with a spectacular header off a long throw by Abhay Kumar. Alvito, coming in as a substitute in the 72nd minute for Venkatesh then scored two more  in the 77th and 85th minutes  with lethal left foot finishes.																								Veteran striker I. M. Vijayan had a disappointing outing for the second match running. He missed three sitters before India coach Stephan Constantine replaced him with Abhishek Yadav with the side leading 1-0.																								Despite Sundays comprehensive victory, India still have work to do to ensure a passage to the last four. They will have to at least draw their final group A match against Sri Lanka on Tuesday to advance into the semi-finals.																								That will enable them finish second as Pakistan are expected to put it across Afghanistan and top the group with an an all-win record. (PTI)

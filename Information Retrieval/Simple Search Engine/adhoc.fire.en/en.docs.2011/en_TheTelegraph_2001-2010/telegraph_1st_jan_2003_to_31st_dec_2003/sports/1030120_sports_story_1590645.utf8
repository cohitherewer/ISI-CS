																								Ahmedabad: Former Indian wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia on Sunday sought an explanation from the BCCI for his non-inclusion in the team for the World Cup.																								I have sought reasons from the board for not including me in the main team in spite of consistent performances for the country, he said at a function where India wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel was the guest of honour.																								It was a torture for me and my family members, Mongia lamented. However, he did not comment on Indias dismal show in the recently concluded series at New Zealand. Players have to adjust quickly to all conditions if they want to perform effectively, he said. (PTI)

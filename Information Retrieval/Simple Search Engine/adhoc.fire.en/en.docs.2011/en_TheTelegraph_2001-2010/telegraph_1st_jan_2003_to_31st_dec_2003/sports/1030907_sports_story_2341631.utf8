 Inzamam ton nails Bangla 
Multan, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Inzamam-ul Haqs unbeaten 138 shattered Bangladeshs dreams of a maiden Test win as Pakistan completed a 3-0 sweep following Saturdays tense one-wicket win in the third and final Test. Inzamam chose his hometown for a return to form and his 18th Test hundred. He began the morning on 53 with Pakistan on 148 for six and lost Saqlain Mushtaq with the total on 164. He took control after that to put on another 98 with the help of tailenders Shabbir Ahmed, Umar Gul and Yasir Ali. Bangladesh got the ninth wicket in the fourth over after lunch. Last man Yasir played out four balls from Khaled Mahmud to give Inzamam the strike on the final ball of the over, which he hit for the winning four. I term this as the best of my career, Inzamam said. He faced 232 balls and hit 20 fours and a six. Match Referee Mike Procter later summoned Rashid Latif, following a complaint by Bangladesh, protesting that the captain had successfully claimed an apparently dropped catch off Alok Kapali. A decision will be taken on Sunday.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Warwicks pile on India A agony
London: Warwickshire continued to pile on India As agony as they amassed 537 before being dismissed in their first innings on a truncated second day at Edgbaston Thursday. Leg spinner Amit Mishra captured five for 183. When bad light stopped play, India A were five without loss, in reply. Although the Indians managed to break the overnight partnership of Ian Bell (75) and Tony Frost (76) early, Warwickshires lower order continued to frustrate their efforts. Bell was caught by Hemang Badani off seamer Avishkar Salvi after only eight runs were added to the overnight total of 302 but his fifth wicket stand with Frost was worth 97 runs. (PTI)  Copyright

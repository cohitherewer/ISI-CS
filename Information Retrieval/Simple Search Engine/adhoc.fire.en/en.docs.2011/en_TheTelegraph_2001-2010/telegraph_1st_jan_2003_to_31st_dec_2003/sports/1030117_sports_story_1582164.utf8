The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 SA govt may intervene on Terms
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI				 	 Mbeki																								Calcutta: A hardening of the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) stand on the Player Terms row with India could see the South African government, headed by Thabo Mbeki, getting into the picture.																								South Africa, after all, is principal host of the sports most ambitious tournament  the World Cup from February 8-March 25  and the Sachin Tendulkars are required for that showpiece.																								That the government may intervene was indicated by the tournaments executive director, Dr Ali Bacher, during a brief telephonic interaction with The Telegraph late Thursday.																								We are in constant touch with our government on issues concerning the World Cup and, if required, we will request it to facilitate the resolution of whatever problems could remain. Obviously, any move by our government will be strictly behind-the-scenes, Dr Bacher observed.																								Speaking from his Johannesburg office, he acknowledged that the Terms dispute and Zimbabwe were the biggest problems confronting his organising committee.																								Talking specifically about the row featuring Indian players, Dr Bacher said: Im confident the very best XV will land in South Africa later this month. Frankly, I dont visualise a situation where a Sourav Ganguly or Sachin or a Rahul Dravid will be missing  and, Im not saying this only because Im an optimist.																								For good measure, he added: In any case, its not insignificant that the ties between South Africa and India are strong. In fact, the bonding gets stronger each year																								Incidentally, Union sports minister Vikram Verma has already pledged the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments support to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).																								The BCCI, of course, is waiting to hear from the ICC  actually, the IDI Ltd, its business arm  on the acceptance or otherwise of the Terms signed conditionally by Sourav and Co.																								While much of the immediate attention is on the World Cup Contracts Committee, the Indians conditional acceptance may eventually be placed on the Executive Boards table.																								At the moment, its fifty-fifty: The conditional signing could be accepted conditionally, allowing for arbitration, or the BCCI may well be asked to make a fresh selection, is how a top ICC source put it.																								Whatever, even Pretoria is watching.

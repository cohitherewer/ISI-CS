The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 04, 2003 				 SA declare at 620 for seven
																								Cape Town: Taufeeq Umar scored an unbeaten 85 to lead a Pakistan revival in the face of a huge South African total on Day II of the second Test on Friday. Pakistan were 141 for one at close, still 479 runs behind South Africa who declared their first innings just before tea at 620 for seven.																								The total was just two runs short of the South African record of 622 for nine set against Australia in 1969-70.																								Taufeeq and Younis Khan shared an unbeaten 105 run second wicket partnership off 194 balls, with Younis not out on 44.																								The visitors toiled under thehot sun on the first day but fared better on the second, taking four wickets for the addition of 175 runs. Boeta Dippenaar scored 62 and Neil McKenzie 51 while Pollock was unbeaten with 36, scored off only 19 balls and including four fours and two sixes.																								Pakistan, needing 421 just to avoid the follow on, started their reply cautiously, taking 4.4 overs to score their first runs.																								But once they got off the mark Taufeeq batted with aggression and took the fight to the home bowlers.																								Pollock support																								Meanwhile, Shaun Pollock would like to see the matches scheduled to be played in Zimbabwe during the World Cup to go ahead next month, the South African captain said on Friday.																								Pollock said: I think the World Cup is a special occasion and it would be disappointing if it was spoilt by issues off the field. Obviously it would be nice for all the three countries (South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe) involved to be able to host the games.																								You can understand some of the teams not wanting to play because they respect their governments view points, which is obviously their decision to make.																								But from my point of view it would just be disappointing if that sort of thing disrupted the World Cup.																								Lanka cancel Tests																								Sri Lanka have cancelled a scheduled Test series in June hosting Pakistan to give their players time to recover from a tough schedule, Pakistani cricket officials said on Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Oxford HS champions
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT  Aizawls Oxford Higher Secondary School players with the Subroto Mukherjee Cup in New Delhi on Sunday. Picture by Prem Singh New Delhi: The rise of Mizoram in age-group football was evident again in the final of the 2003 Subroto Mukerjee Cup (under-17) tournament. Oxford Higher Secondary School, Aizawl became the second school from the state to annex this prestigious tournament. In a pulsating final on Sunday, they overcame tenacious Govt. Senior Secondary School, Malacca, Car Nicobar, 4-2 in the penalty shoot-out, after the match ended 1-1 in regulation time. On Saturday, the Aizawl-based Holy Heart School won the Subroto Cup for under-14 years category and earlier this season, Mizoram annexed the national sub-junior title for the Mir Iqbal Hussein Trophy. Two years ago, Govt. Higher Secondary School, Aizawl became the first team from Mizoram to win the tournament. The match started at a brisk pace. In the fifth minute, the Car Nicobar schools crafty left winger Manvah dribbled past right back Zarazoliana and sent a low cross to the far post. Onrushing right winger W. Ashaels firm grounder was deflected into the net. Stung by this reversal, the Mizoram school attacked in waves but could not penetrate rivals back four. The equaliser came in injury time. The overworked Car Nicobar defence reacted slowly as skipper Zarazolianas diagonal pass was trapped by striker Jerry Zorinsanga, who was allowed time to pivot and score. In the penalty shoot-out, Lalramhluana, Zodingliana, David Lalchuanawma and Lalmalsawma scored for Oxford HSS. For Malacca school, Ashael and Manvah scored and Albertus and Sylvesters tries were saved. The Aizawl school got Rs. 50,000 for winnng the trophy while their opponents had to be satisfied with Rs. 30,000.  Copyright

 Mashud to quit after World Cup
 Johannesburg: Bangladesh skipper Khaled Mashud is all set to quit captaincy after the World Cup in South Africa, but not before helping his team end a record sequence of defeats. We just hope to win a couple of matches in the World Cup, said Mashud, whose team is winless since the last World Cup in England in 1999 having suffered a record 26 consecutive defeats in ODIs. Mashud said he is confident he has the team to fulfil their limited ambitions as they could beat non-Test playing nationsCanada and Kenya. Bangladesh are clubbed with South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Canada and Kenya in the preliminary group. I just want to play as a member of the team after the World Cup in order to spend more time with my family, said Mashud, nicknamed the Pilot. Teams sources, however, say Mashud is stepping down as captain because he is unhappy with the Bangadesh Cricket Board for ingoring his advice to improve the team. He is resigning as captain in sheer disappointment, the sources said. But Mashud is determined to bow out on a high note, saying he only expects his team to repeat the last Cup performance in England where they managed to win two matches. We just want to repeat the same performance this time also, said Mashud, the only player to have figured in three Bangladesh wins so far in 61 one-day Internationals. Mashud, who made his one-day debut against India in the 1994-95 Asia Cup, is not an exciting stroke-player but a gutsy lower-order batsman capable of putting up a stiff resistance in crisis. He is the highest run-getter in the current team, having made 659 in 51 one-dayers. Mashud, 27, is also tidy behind the stumps as he has accounted for 47 dismissals in one-dayers, including nine stumpings.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Stadium of Light makes way for Luz 
Lisbon: Demolition began at Benficas Stadium of Light on Monday, bringing to an end half a century of glorious football at one of the worlds greatest arenas. Dubbed both the cathedral and inferno for the fervour of its fans, the stadium was home to Portugals most successful club and its greatest player Eusebio and was the launch pad for George Bests rocket to stardom in the 1960s. The new Luz stadium, being built next door, will host the final of next years European championship. I have a lot of nostalgia for the old stadium because there were so many great victories here, vice-chairman Mario Dias said during a tour of the 65,000-seat new site. Eusebio said he had wept at Benficas last game in the old stadium, a 1-0 win over Santa Clara on March 22. I couldnt hold back the tears even knowing that this light was going out so that the Luz of the 21st century could go on, he said. Built in 1954 with 30,000 seats, the old stadium was expanded to a maximum of 120,000 seats in 1985  Europes largest stadium. Renovation and the destruction of one end as part of the new building had, however, cut the number of seats. Benfica, two-time European Cup champions, still has the countrys biggest fan base. Best, the Manchester United winger, marked one of the greatest moments at Luz with a stunning performance in a European Cup quarter-final in 1966 that established him as the fifth Beatle.

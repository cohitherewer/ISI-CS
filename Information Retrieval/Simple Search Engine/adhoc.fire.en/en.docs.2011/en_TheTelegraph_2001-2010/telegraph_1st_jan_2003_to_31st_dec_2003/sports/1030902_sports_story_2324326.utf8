The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, September 02, 2003  Bharath worth following 
 BY STAR RACER		 Bharath						Calcutta: It may be worth following trainer Bharath Singh in Tuesdays six-event race card. All his runners, in almost the entire card, have potential to land their respective events. 				 										Bharaths Argento and Aiberni, in two of the three trophy events during the afternoon  the Douetil Memorial Cup and the feature event, the Predator Cup  are the frontrunners. While Argento had matched strides against a far too superior opposition in Bangalore, Aiberni is looking vastly improved since promoted to the present class.				 										Bharaths other horses, who are capable of doing the trick, are Followme, Frontier Flame and Wordsworth, a Mumbai migrant.				 										Followme, though assigned a topweight of 60-kg, possesses class to beat the six in the opposition, including her stable-mate Starry Man. Frontier Flame, on the other hand, has improved since his failure as a favo-urite, while Wordsworth is looking and working well.

 FROM A CORRESPONDENT Bhubaneswar: After the end of the fifth round Thursday, three players were leading the field with five points in The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship, Bhubaneswar leg, being played in Gymnasium-cum-Indoor Hall, Sahid Nagar. Three players were closely following the leaders on 4.5 points.

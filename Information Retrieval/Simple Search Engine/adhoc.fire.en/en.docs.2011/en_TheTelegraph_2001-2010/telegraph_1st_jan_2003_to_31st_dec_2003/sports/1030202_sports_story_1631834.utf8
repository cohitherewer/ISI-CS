 England game most vital: Latif
 Durban, Feb. 1 (PTI): Pakistan wicketkeeper Rashid Latif today said his sides league game against England  and not India or Australia  would be the most crucial for the teams chances in the World Cup. I know most of the people think the match against Australia or India is crucial. But I believe the game against England in Cape Town on February 22 is the most important. It is a match in between the games against Australia and India, Latif said. If we beat England, I am sure we will reach the semi- finals and if luck favours us on that day, we will qualify for the final, he said. Rashid said the game against England is vital because it is Pakistans only day-night game in the league stage. Everybody knows the Cape Town wicket plays tricks. If we win there, we would be on a roll because prior to that game we would have played Namibia and then after the England game we would be playing Holland, he was quoted as saying in a PCB release. Naturally, when you are on a winning spree, the confidence level of the team is sky-high, he said. India, on the contrary, will play Pakistan after having tackled England in Durban under lights on February 26. Rashid said Pakistans first match, against Australia on February 11, promised exciting cricket.  Copyright

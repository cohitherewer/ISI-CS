Picture by Uma Shankar Dubey Jamshedpur: Priya Ratnam of Chapra won the Jamshedpur leg of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship which concluded at the J.R.D. Tata Complex on Wednesday. In the final round, Priya (9.5), playing white, did not seem too keen on a victory against Minahul Hoda of Chapra and signed the peace treaty after 26 moves. That was enough for her to walk away with the title as Minki Sinha, Tuesdays joint leader, lost her final round game against third seeded Ashish Kumar. The victory helped Ashish finish within the top 10. Minki finished second followed by Minajul, Sourav Anand and Ramesh Kumar. All five qualify for the Calcutta leg of the tournament scheduled to start on August 24. Ramesh, a tribal player from Jamshedpur, won his final round match against Shwet Shyamal to finish on nine. The other six tribal players fared well, but failed to make the prize pool. In another match, Parag Hunny of Chapra beat Pammi Rani of Patna to finish seventh. In the biggest upset of the day, ten-year old Kumar Sanu of Dhanbad beat Ved Prakash of Patna in 72 moves to finish eighth.  FINAL STANDINGS  1. Priya Ratnam; 2. Minki  Sinha; 3. Minahul Hoda; 4.

		 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 Forlan continues to haunt Chelsea
				 	 Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini sits dejected after letting in the Manchester United winner at Old Trafford Saturday. (Reuters)																								Manchester, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Uruguayan substitute Diego Forlan fired an injury-time winner as Manchester United came from behind to beat Chelsea 2-1 in a pulsating Premier League clash at Old Trafford on Saturday.																								Icelandic striker Eidur Gudjohnsen flicked Chelsea into a 30th minute lead, Paul Scholes headed home a superb cross from fellow England midfielder David Beckham nine minutes later and the match looked destined to finish all square.																								But Forlan, who had also scored the winner when United beat Chelsea 1-0 in last months League Cup quarter final, hammered home a spectacular goal deep in stoppage time to keep the pressure on League leaders Arsenal.																								The victory extended Uniteds run of consecutive home league wins to seven and left them on 47 points  two behind champions Arsenal, who host West Ham United in Sundays London derby. Chelsea started strongly, playing some neat attacking football, their best chance to score coming after half an hour.																								French midfielder Emmanuel Petit threaded a perfect pass through Uniteds static defence and Gudjohnsen ran on to tip the ball deftly over the diving body of France keeper Fabien Barthez. 																								United shrugged off the setback and, just when they needed a break, Alex Fergusons men capitalised on a rare blunder by Chelsea keeper Carlo Cudicini.																								Despite being under no real pressure, the Italians panicky clearance went straight to Beckham on the right flank and the England captains inch-perfect cross was headed powerfully home by Scholes.																								The final blow was delivered by Forlan. He latched on to a long ball into the Chelsea area from another substitute, Argentine midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron, and blasted his shot past Cudicini into the roof of the net.																								A delighted Ferguson could savour the victory all the more since it was only Uniteds third in their last 11 League games against Chelsea at Old Trafford.																								For Chelsea, on 41 points, the defeat lost them further ground on the League leaders, seriously undermining their bid for the title.

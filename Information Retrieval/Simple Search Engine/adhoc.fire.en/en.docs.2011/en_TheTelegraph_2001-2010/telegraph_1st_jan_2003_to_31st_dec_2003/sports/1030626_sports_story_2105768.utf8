 Pace foundation to be academy
Chennai: MRF Pace Foundation will soon become a full fledged academy, on the lines of the Australian Cricket Academy, by diversifying to encompass all aspects of the game. Disclosing this, legendary Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee said that though no timeframe had been fixed, it was imperative for the foundation to provide coaching in batting and fielding too.

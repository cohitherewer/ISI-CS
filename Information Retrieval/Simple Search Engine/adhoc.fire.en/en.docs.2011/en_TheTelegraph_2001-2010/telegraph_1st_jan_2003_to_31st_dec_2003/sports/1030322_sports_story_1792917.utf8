 Top teams for Beighton Cup
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Top 14 teams of India, including holders Punjab Police and runners-up CRPF, will take part in the 108th Indian Oil Servo Beighton Cup hockey meet, which started here on Friday. Apart from the last years finalists, Punjab and Sind Bank and Indian Oil have been seeded and will play from the quarter-final leg of this three-tier knock-out-cum-round robin league-cum knockout meet. Speaking at a press conference Friday, Bengal Hockey Asociation secretary Gurbux Singh hoped that with India not going to the Azlan Shah meet in Kuala Lumpur, the city event may witness a few international stars. The semi-finals and final of the 15-day meet will be held at Mohun Bagan ground on April 2 and April 4, respectively. Bengal Hockey Association has roped in Officers Choice as sponsor for its local league this season. The company will also sponsor senior Bengal teams in all national-level competitions.

 Seaman confirms City move
London: Former England goalkeeper David Seaman will play for Manchester City next season after ending a 13-year spell at Arsenal. Seaman, 39, was out of contract at Arsenal whose manager, Arsene Wenger, had asked him to stay on as a squad player and goalkeeping coach. But Seaman, only recently dropped by England, wanted first team soccer. He has agreed terms with City on a one-year deal, Premier League City said on their website on Wednesday. He will replace another veteran keeper, Denmarks Peter Schmeichel, who retired at the end of last season. I am over the moon that David has signed for City. With his vast experience he could not be a better replacement in goal for Manchester City following Peter Schmeichels retirement, chairman John Wardle said. Seaman, who played his 1,000th club and international match last season, is two months older than Schmeichel. His last game for the London side was last months FA Cup final when Arsenal beat Southampton 1-0 with Seaman  captain for the day  making a stunning save in the matchs closing stages.

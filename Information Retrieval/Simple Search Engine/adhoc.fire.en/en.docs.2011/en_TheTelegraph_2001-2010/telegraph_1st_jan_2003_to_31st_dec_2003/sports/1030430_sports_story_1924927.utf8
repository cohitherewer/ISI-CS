 Big W purse gets bigger
London: Wimbledon announced a 9.5 per cent increase in singles prize money for this years championships on Tuesday. The mens champion will now receive 575,000, an increase of 50,000 over what Lleyton Hewitt received in 2002, and the womens winner will take away 535,000. Serena Williams earned 486,000 for her win over sister Venus last year. Prize money in the other events is the same as last year. In total the purse will be 9.37 million. Tournament chairman Tim Phillips said: Leading athletes in top spectator sports such as tennis are rightly well rewarded for their outstanding talent and the entertainment they bring us. First round losers in the mens singles will make 8,630, 750 more than last year. Womens singles first round losers will earn 6,900, an increase of 600. Phillips also said that the queue of people camping out had grown to 9,000  an increase of 6,000 on other days  and needed to be reduced for safety reasons. Now, there will only be 500 tickets on sale for the Centre Court on that Saturday instead of the 2,000 available last year. The remaining 1,500 tickets will be redistributed to the public in a ballot beforehand and to accredited clubs. (Reuters)  Copyright

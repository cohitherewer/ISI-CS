 Schumi mania sweeps Kerpen
Kerpen: Michael Schumacher packed his bags and left his grimy, working-class hometown for glamorous tax exile 10 years ago but that has not stopped Kerpen from turning itself into a shrine to the German champion. Some 30,000 Schumacher fans made the pilgrimage to the town at the weekend to watch their hero win his record-breaking sixth Formula One world championship on giant television screens and celebrate with parties, concerts and kart races through closed-off streets. The beer- and bratwurst-fuelled rally by fans in bright red Ferrari colours was only the tip of the Schumi-mania iceberg for Kerpen, a once-seedy town of 63,000 people that lies 30 km west of Cologne near an abandoned open pit mine. Shrugging off the loss of its coal mining industry, Kerpen has reinvented itself in recent years as a centre for transportation and logistics  and, of course, as Schumachers home town. He may not live here any more but Kerpen and Michael Schumacher will always be linked to each other, said the towns mayor Ralf Valkysers. At least 30,000 people came to Kerpen for the weekend to be here to celebrate because of him. This will always be his home town, Valkysers added, brushing off suggestions that Kerpen had simply adopted a clever marketing ploy by using Schumachers name a decade after he moved to Monaco, and later Switzerland, partly to avoid high German taxes. Hes still got a lot of connections to Kerpen. His father lives here, his friends are here and his roots are here. Hell always be a Kerpen lad no matter where he lives. Schumachers name is everywhere in Kerpen, even though he pays only a few short visits each year  such as in April after his mother Elisabeth died. The Kart Centre is on a road called Michael-Schumacher-Strasse where the street signs have been frequently stolen by souvenir hunters. There are 250,000 tourists who come to Kerpen each year just to see the place where Schumacher is from, said Dieter Follmann, a spokesman for city hall and special events director. Follmann said one British logistics company had set up operations in Kerpen, which is located on a major motorway not far from the Belgian border, because executives had heard about the town thanks to Schumacher. Kerpen was awakened from its sleep thanks to Schumacher, said Follmann. If we had to pay for the advertising value hes given Kerpen, the town would be bankrupt. The Schumachers grew up at the kart track. Their father Rolf, a bricklayer, moonlighted at the track, keeping the karts running and collecting tickets while their mother Elisabeth sold sausages. Michael was a few years younger than me but I remember seeing him as a little kid out on the kart track helping out, said welder Harald Schwerfel, 41, who wore a bright red, Schumacher-style Ferrari outfit to go kart-racing on Sunday. He doesnt live here but Kerpen lives off him. (Reuters)  Copyright

																								Sydney: Englands Mark Butcher has not been in the best of rhythm in the ongoing Ashes series. But he felt that a musical session on his trusted guitar in the New Years Eve for his teammates helped him get back to rhythm.																								It was good, its funny, I never lose that one, thats the rhythm that stays with me, Butcher said. Maybe, its the music thing that just comes and goes sometimes, the rhythm disappears and fortunately after tea time today, it came back.																								Butcher made 54 in the first innings of the series opener in Brisbane but has added just 106 in seven Test innings since then before Thursday.																								Ive struggled a bit to be honest, its been fairly difficult. Ive been a bit concerned about when the rhythm was going to come back. I dont know why but fortunately things came back to me.																								He also admitted that his innings of 124 was blessed by several moments of good fortune but he did not let that stop him from enjoying the moment.																								I didnt feel that great to be honest but the actual feeling of making a hundred itself was pretty special. I was really happy which isnt always the case when I get to 100. It doesnt happen that often but it hasnt always been such a massive rush of adrenalin like it was today.																								By his own admission, the 30-year-old was helped by two dropped catches from the Australians, the second of which was a straightforward chance to Adam Gilchrist, and two umpiring decisions that went his way.																								I wouldnt be the first person on either side to have had more than one go of it in an innings on this trip so Im not going to make any apologies, he said.																								Australian coach John Buchanan had a word of praise for Butcher. You have to give them credit. He had a bit of fortune but was able to capitalise and thats the sign of a good player.  (REUTERS)

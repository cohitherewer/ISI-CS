 Women players plan hunger strike
New Delhi: Women football players will stage a one-day hungerstrike in front of the sports ministry here on April 7 to protest against attempts by the All India Football Federation to destroy the Womens Football Federation of India. The hungerstrike will be undertaken by both senior and junior players who will try to convince the sports ministry that the womens football team selected by the AIFF is not the real Indian team, a statement said on Wednesday. The players alleged that since most of the women footballers were playing with the founder body WFFI, they were not getting selected. The players said they will urge the ministry not to sanction any proposal of the AIFF in regard to womens football since the AIFF did not follow the decision and directives taken in the meeting conducted by the sports ministry on June 8, 2001, the release said.

 List of venues to be finalised by May
Castries, Sept. 27 (AP): Island nations to host 2007 World Cup cricket matches will be selected by next May, officials said today. A consortium of British, Caribbean and South African consultants was awarded a contract to help the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) assess venues for the tournament, informed Don Lockerbie, venue development director of the West Indies World Cup Organising Committee. Officials selected IMG, South Africa-based Rushmans and Britain-based SKM after a four-month bidding process involving 42 companies. The West Indies, winners in 1975 and 1979, will be hosting the tournament for the first time.  Copyright

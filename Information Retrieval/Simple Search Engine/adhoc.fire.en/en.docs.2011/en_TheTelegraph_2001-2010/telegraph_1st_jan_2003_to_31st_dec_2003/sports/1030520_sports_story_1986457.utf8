 Delhi HC notice to Jadeja 
New Delhi: Delhi High Court has issued notice to cricketer Ajay Jadeja on the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCIs) petition challenging arbitrator Justice J. K. Mehras award. In his award, Justice Mehra had set aside the five-year ban imposed on the allrounder in the wake of the match-fixing controversy. However, on Friday, Justice Manmohan Sarin issued notices to Jadeja, BCCIs anti-corruption commissioner K. Madhavan and members of the disciplinary committee and asked them to file their replies by July 8, the next date of hearing. The BCCI challenged the arbitrators award on April 25, just two days before it was to become binding. The award, passed on January 27 would have become final on April 27 at the expiry of the 90-day statutory period, had it gone unchallenged. Meanwhile, Jadeja filed a petition before a division bench of the court on Monday accusing the BCCI of scuttling his selection for the Ranji Trophy by advising the Delhi District Cricket Association not to select him. BCCI counsel Radha Rangaswami opposed the petition. She said it could not be entertained by the division bench as the award has already been challenged. However, the bench comprising Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice R. S. Sodhi directed the petition to be placed before Justice Sarin, who is hearing BCCIs petition against the award.

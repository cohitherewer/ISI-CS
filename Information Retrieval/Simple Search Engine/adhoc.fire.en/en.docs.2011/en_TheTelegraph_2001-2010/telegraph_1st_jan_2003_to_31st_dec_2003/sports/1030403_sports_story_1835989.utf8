 Woolmer declines offer to coach Sri Lanka
 Woolmer: To concentrate on ICC role Colombo: Former South African coach Bob Woolmer has rejected an offer by Sri Lanka to coach its national team, a report said on Wednesday. He decided instead to continue in a role with the International Cricket Council (ICC). They (Sri Lanka) did ask me but I turned them down, Woolmer told BBC Sport Online. The Sri Lankan cricket board approached the former England Test player after deciding not to renew national coach Dav Whatmores contract, which expires in May. Woolmers decision leaves Sri Lanka with the choice of two other former Test players  former Australian wicketkeeper Steve Rixon and former New Zealand allrounder John Bracewell  running for the post. With the New Zealand team set to arrive by the end of the month for a two-Test and one-day tri-series with Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the cricket board wants to fill the vacancy quickly, the state-run Daily News said. Woolmer will continue with the ICC, where he has helped Canada, Holland, Kenya and Namibia with their participation in the 2003 World Cup. I have put my target on the ICC role for the associate nations, he said. Woolmer, 54, played for England between 1975 and 1981 as a batsman and occasional medium pace bowler, scoring 1,059 runs in 19 Tests. He also coached Warwickshire and the South African national side, the newspaper said. Former Australian wicketkeeper Rixon, 49, coached the New Zealand team from 1996 to 1999, then returned to Sydney for a second stint as coach of New South Wales. (AP)  Copyright

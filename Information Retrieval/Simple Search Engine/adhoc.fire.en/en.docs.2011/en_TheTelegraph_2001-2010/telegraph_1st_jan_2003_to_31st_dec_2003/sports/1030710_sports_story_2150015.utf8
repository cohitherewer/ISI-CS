The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Four each for Mishra, Pathan 
London: Irfan Pathan and Amit Mishra claimed four wickets each as India A restricted Yorkshire to 246 in their first innings on the opening day of their three-day match at Headingley on Wednesday. Yorkshire, electing to bat, were helped by half-centuries from Michael Lumb and Tim Bresnan but the other batsmen failed to make much impression. Pathan finished with four for 60 from his 15.2 overs while leg- spinner Mishra claimed four for 42 from 21 overs. In reply, India A were 29 for one at close, having lost captain Shiv Sundar Das for two. Wasim Jaffer, on 22, and Gautam Gambhir, on 5, were at the crease. India A tasted early success when pacer Amit Bhandari dismissed the home captain Matthew Wood for five when the score was just 10 runs. Opener Chris Taylor (13) also fell cheaply before Lumb, who top-scored with 65, took charge of the proceedings. (PTI)  Copyright

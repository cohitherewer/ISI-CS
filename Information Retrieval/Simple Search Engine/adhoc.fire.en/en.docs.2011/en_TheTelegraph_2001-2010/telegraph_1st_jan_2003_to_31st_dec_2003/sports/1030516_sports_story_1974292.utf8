 Sehwags poor County form continues
London: Virender Sehwags poor run of form in his debut English season for Leicestershire continued as he failed in his fourth successive innings. He was dismissed for two in a three-day County match against Surrey. After a string of poor scores in the one-day matches, Sehwag was dismissed cheaply by Pakistans Azhar Mahmood Wednesday when he gifted a catch in the slips after facing 12 balls. Leicestershire were bowled out for 200. Sehwag, aggregating just 40 runs from three one-day games, had shown promise in the first match after arriving when he made 23 with the help of some delectable strokes. That was about all as he could manage scores of just one against Gloucestershire and 16 against Northumberland. Sehwag will have to justify his reputation as an explosive bat in the second innings of the ongoing match at The Oval.  (PTI)  Copyright

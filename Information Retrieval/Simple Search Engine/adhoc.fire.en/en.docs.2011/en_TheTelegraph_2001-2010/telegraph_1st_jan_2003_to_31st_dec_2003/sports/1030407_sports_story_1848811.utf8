The two teams will be joined by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 				 																																	Saturdays play produced both disappointment and excitement. The clash between West Indians Carl Hooper and Chris Gayle and Pakistanis Wasim Akram and Shahid Afridi, which had been billed as the match of the tournament, ended in an anticlimax when Pakistan conceded the match after Afridi suffered a back injury. Later Englands big-hitting Andrew Flintoff belted 12 sixes, but was out four times and had his score reduced by 40. Englands 112 was the highest of the tournament so far.

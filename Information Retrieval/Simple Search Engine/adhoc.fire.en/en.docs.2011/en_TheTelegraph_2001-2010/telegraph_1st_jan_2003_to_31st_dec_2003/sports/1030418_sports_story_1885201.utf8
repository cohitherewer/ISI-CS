The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Subrata to move court
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subrata: In dialogue with dissident faction Calcutta: The state of affairs in Mohun Bagan, like their football this season, is dismal. A hugely successful coach has been unceremoniously discarded, there is discontent about various other matters among club members and to top it all, nobody is around to answer the queries doing the rounds. To begin with, former coach Subrata Bhattacharya has decided to move court about the kind of language used in the letter announcing the termination of his contract. This doesnt augur well for the current regime  already fighting several cases filed by groups of dissatisfied club members. I will go to the court. Not to protest my sacking, but to complain against the way the letter was framed, said Subrata Thursday, 48 hours after his glittering stint as Mohun Bagan coach came to an end. I will consult a lawyer and maybe as early as Monday, the legal process will get underway. When approached, club secretary Anjan Mitra refused to react. Subrata has also got in touch with the Mohun Bagan Members and Supporters Guild  an informal organisation floated to raise voice against the existing office bearers. This body, though unregistered, is apparently growing in strength and Subratas sudden ouster has won them a few more friends. Members of the guild claimed Subrata has promised to join them with 40-50 former players, though the former coach didnt confirm this. I have spoken to them, but cant elaborate at the moment. Subrata added he will resume going to the club in the next few days, but he wont even consider the proposal to coach the team again if a few people are still around. I will certainly not take charge of Mohun Bagan if these elements continue calling the shots. Its too early to expect Subarata to be back as Mohun Bagan coach, but as if to add twist to the tale, Mitra said: The door is not permanently closed. Now, about the question still begging an answer. Nobody knows, or dont say so even if they do, who is going to take charge of the team next season. As of now, Subratas deputies Bidesh Bose and Shyamal Banerjee have been asked to look after the team for the last three National League matches. Among the possible candidates, Syed Nayeemuddins name looks prominent at the moment. The former India captain and coach is in Hyderabad at the moment and may have a talk with Mohun Bagan officials in the next few days.  Copyright

 Suspect surrenders
Madrid: A man police suspect of launching an attack that caused the death of a Spanish football fan earlier this week gave himself up voluntarily to authorities in the northwestern city of Santiago on Thursday. A man, accompanied by his lawyer, presented himself before the judge who is investigating the case in Santiago, a police spokesperson said. We are in the process of confirming that he is the suspect we are looking for. We believe it is him. Deportivo La Coruna supporter Manuel Rios Suarez, 31, died after he was attacked by a member of the clubs radical group, known as the Riazor Blues. He had been watching his side beat Galician rivals Santiago Compostela 1-0 in a Kings Cup first round match on Tuesday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

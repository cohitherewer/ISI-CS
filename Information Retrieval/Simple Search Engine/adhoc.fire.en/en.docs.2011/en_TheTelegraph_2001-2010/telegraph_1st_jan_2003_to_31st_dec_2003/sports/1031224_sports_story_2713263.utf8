 Olympic medal drives Ferrero 
Sydney: World number three Juan Carlos Ferrero says he wants to play in the Olympic Games next year, unlike his Australian Davis Cup conqueror Lleyton Hewitt. Former world number one Hewitt announced last week he would not compete in Athens because the dates were too close to the US Open, the years fourth major which begins a week after the Olympics. I want to play in the tennis because in four more years I will be 28 years old, Ferrero said. I think next year I have the opportunity to win a medal, he told reporters on Monday in a telephone conference call from Spain. The French Open champion will play in the Sydney international tournament next month before the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on January 19.  He said revenge for Australias defeat of Spain in the Davis Cup final last month would not be high on his agenda.  (Reuters)  Copyright

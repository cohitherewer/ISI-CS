 Bhandari bags 5, Gambhir hits ton
Pune: Opener Gautam Gambhir hit an unbeaten 117 as India A made 203 for three on Day II of the second Test against Sri Lanka A at the Nehru Stadium here on Sunday. Gambhir (batting 117) struck 17 boundaries in his 183-ball knock as the Indians replied to the visitors 340 in the first innings. Keeping the left-hander company was Rohan Gavaskar who was unbeaten on 28. Resuming at 255 for three, the Sri Lankans found Amit Bhandari too hot to handle. The paceman returned figures of five for 70 as Lanka lost their last seven wickets for the addition of just 76 runs. Left-arm spinner Murali Kartik, who missed the first Test because of a flu, chipped in with two wickets.  (PTI)  Copyright

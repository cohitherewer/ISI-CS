 Ray Mali takes over 
Durban, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Ray Mali was elected president of the UCBSA Saturday, succeeding Percy Sonn. Sonn, who had been president since 2000, did not stand for re-election and will attempt to further his career in cricket administration at international level. I am very conscious of the fact that I come from a cricket culture that stretches back more than 100 years, but that was marginalised by apartheid for nearly five decades, said Mali, 66, who was elected unopposed. (The office of UCB president)... is about leadership of cricket in a dynamic South Africa at a time when we are striving to become the worlds top cricketing nation, Mali said.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Scarcity of talent hurting Pakistan  cricket, not abysmal form
 - India game one of my most disappointing;  Decision on retirement after consulting family Fast Track / Wasim Akram We are on our way home after a  very disappointing World Cup campaign. Im writing this  from a transit lounge in an airport. The players are in  huddles all over the lounge, and there is an overwhelming  feeling of anxiety about the reception that awaits us in  Pakistan.  Home should be the last place  one would fear going to, but our past experience has led  to a situation where everyone is dreading the backlash at  home.  It would be hard to convince our  supporters, but we are even more disheartened about the  way things turned out.  Personally, I am worried about  the future of Pakistan cricket. We have been losing non-stop  since August 2002, which suggests that its not a question  of form but of ability.  Critics back home may criticise  the form of some players, but the worrying part is that  this squad did comprise the best of Pakistani cricket. When  your best isnt good enough, it means there is a shortage  of talent. For the first time in my 18-year  career, I see a paucity of talent in the country. Plenty  of young batsmen have been tried out since August, but not  one stands out as a special talent. Sometimes its lack  of ability, but most of the time it is lack of application.  No one of the calibre of Inzamam  ul-Haq, Saeed Anwar or Yusuf Youhana is on the horizon,  and that is a poor comment on our domestic cricket. AFRIDI: Uninspiring approach The other problem was that while  the squad is more or less the same as the one that played  in 1999, some of the youngsters showed promise then have  failed to deliver in the last 12 months. Thats just too  long a period to be out of form, and the selectors must  take a long hard look at the likes of Shahid Afridi.  When we spoke to Afridi about  his seemingly endless run of poor form, he argued that he  was in and out of the team too often.  But thats the whole point  Afridis  approach would hardly inspire any captain to persist with  him for any length of time.  Abdul Razzaq, at  the Lahore airport Friday, may benefit by taking a break.  (AP/PTI)  Abdul Razzaq, who did just about  everything right in the 1999 World Cup, is the other major  concern. He made his debut under me, and I thought he had  it in him to become one of the best allrounders of his generation.  He is just not able to pick up his level of performance,  and this has really hit the team hard. Perhaps a break from  the game will do him some good. There were times when Waqar Younis  would sit to pick the team, in consultation with some of  us seniors, and we would be hard put to find XI players  since everyone was going through a lean patch.  Our batsmen were in such poor  form that playing five bowlers was never an option. However,  our bowling was also not firing, so even when we made early  breakthroughs, an off-colour Razzaq and Afridi would let  the opposition off the hook. Personally, my aim was to ensure  Pakistan did well in my last World Cup, and I failed in  that.  The only consolation was that  apart from the India match, I was able to make a breakthrough  with the new ball in every game. That game against India will remain  with me as one of the greatest disappointments of my career.  Many people have already jumped  the gun and announced my retirement.  I have to think about Pakistan  cricket, consult my family and friends and only then will  I come out with a statement about my future plans. Right now my judgement has been  clouded by our disgraceful performance in South Africa.  GAMEPLAN Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rs 1.1m found in room occupied by Atapattu
 - Lanka board seeks investigation  Atapattu, who has denied owning the money, in a pensive mood on Sunday Colombo: Sri Lankas cricket board called for a police investigation on Sunday after a large sum of cash was reportedly found in a hotel room that had been occupied by the national teams vice-captain Maravan Atapattu. An article in the Sunday Observer claimed that Rs 1.1 million had been found in a room occupied by Atapattu by a hotel employee shortly after Sri Lankas second Test against England in Kandy last week. Atapattu denied owning the money. Sunday Observer, however, did not identify the player but said he was a top order batsman, who has never bowled. But Atapattu stepped out of the teams dressing room at the start of the fourth days play in the third and final Test in Colombo to clarify his position. I have nothing to do with that money, Atapattu said. I dont carry such huge amounts of money while playing. I dont know to whom the money belongs. Other people have stayed in that room before me and after I left the hotel. There was a news item today in one of the English newspapers stating that some money was found in a Kandy hotel room that had been occupied by one of our players, said Ajit Jayasekera, the team manager, at a news conference on Sunday. It implies that it was found in a room occupied by Mr Maravan Atapattu but he has denied totally that it is his money. There were several people that occupied that room after Maravan had left and it could be possible that the money belongs to someone else. The cricket board will be conducting an inquiry into this and will get the CID to find out what really took place. Were investigating the recovery of a large sum of money from a room in the hotel where the Sri Lankan cricketers stayed in Kandy, an investigator said on the condition of anonymity.

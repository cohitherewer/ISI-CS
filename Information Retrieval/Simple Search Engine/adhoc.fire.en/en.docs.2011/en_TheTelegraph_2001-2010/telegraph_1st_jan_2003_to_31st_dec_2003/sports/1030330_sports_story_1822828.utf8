The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PSB book semis berth 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, March 29: Punjab amp; Sind Bank (PSB) booked a semi-final berth in the Indian Oil Servo Beighton Cup championship Saturday with a 2-1 victory over BSF. A goal in arrears at the halfway mark, PSB showed great spirit and determination to turn the tables on the superbly fit BSF side. After Davinder Singh had hit the bulls eye in the 31st minute, Ajitpal Singh and Baljit Singh Chandi struck telling blows within a space of four minutes in the second half to knock BSF cold. This was PSBs second win in as many games in the quarter final league. BSF, who got the better of Air India Friday, would need to overcome CRPF to advance to the last four. CRPF, who lost 0-3 to PSB, roared back into reckoning with a 3-0 verdict versus Air India Saturday. All their goals came in the opening half  through Tepher Kujur (20th), S.K. Vashisht (23rd) and Sudhir Bara (33rd). Indian Oil brushed aside the disappointment of their 2-4 reversal against Army XI with a 5-2 drubbing of Bombay XI. Setting a fast pace and going all out from the outset, Indian Oil went 4-0 up after 49 minutes. India forward Prabhjot Singh netted two field goals in between Kamlesh Kumars strike and Deepak Thakurs penalty corner conversion. Prabhjot added a third to his name even as Izhar Hussain and Rahul Bhatkar pulled two back for Bombay XI. Punjab Police and Army XI shared six penalty corner goals to brighten semi-final hopes. Army XI lost the lead twice but finally had to catch up with the policemen to ensure a point. Harmik Singh got a brace for Punjab Police, Gabbar Singh the third. T. Tirkey, Paramjeet Singh and Sunil Ekka found the mark for the armymen. Final on Wednesday Meanwhile, the final has been rescheduled for Wednesday with the semis coming off the day before. That would mean the finalists would be playing five matches in six days but the dictates of television leaves the BHA with no other choice. It wouldnt be possible for Doordarshan to arrange live telecast of the final after Wednesday.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Its all raw talent, says Collins
 Kim Collins after winning the mens 100m in Paris on Monday. (Reuters) Paris: Kim Collins hailed himself as the most natural sprinter in the world after storming to the 100 metres gold for the tiny Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis on Monday. I dont lift weights, I dont believe in pumping iron and I dont take vitamins. Its all raw talent, Collins said after ending American Maurice Greenes six-year reign as world champion. Commonwealth champion Collins said he felt no pressure before the final with all the attention focussed on world record holder Tim Montgomery and European champion Dwain Chambers. Im not one of those hard-working sprinters, he said. Im more easy going. My hamstrings are not strong. I really dont feel you should kill yourself (in training). Then, pointing at his coach Monty Stratton, Collins said: He knows that if I dont feel like coming to practice then hes going to get a phone call. Hes going to respect my decision and know that Im not going to cheat myself. Its good for him to accept that and to continue to work with me. Collins said his victory would be celebrated long and hard on St Kitts and Nevis, two Caribbean islands with a combined population of 40,000 that gained independence from Britain in 1983. The 27-year-old spends three months of the year in the Caribbean, and the rest of his time in Texas. I come from a big family. My mum had 11 children and I am number six. I like to go home. Asked if he was now favourite to take Olympic gold in Athens next year, Collins replied: I dont think so. Mainly because the Americans are not going to take it lying down. They have the Olympic champion (Greene) and the world record holder. They are going to come out firing. You dont like to lose.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

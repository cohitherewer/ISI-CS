 Warne hopes to return better than ever
 Shane Warne finds it difficult to watch Australias matches on TV Melbourne: Shane Warne says he hopes to return to cricket better than ever after serving his 12-month doping ban and admits he finds it tough to watch Australias games on television. Test crickets second leading wicket-taker will be available for selection in February next year and is also considering making a comeback to one-day Internationals. I still think I have a few good years left in me, the leg-spinner said in an interview on Australia television aired on Monday night. Ill use these 12 months wisely, keep myself fit as I am now, come up with a few new deliveries, the 33-year-old added. Hopefully I will come back better than ever. Warne missed Australias successful World Cup defence when he was banned for 12 months in February after testing positive for diuretics. The Australian announced in January he would retire from one-day Internationals after the World Cup. Warne has been watching Ricky Pontings side take a 4-1 lead in the seven-match one-day series in the West Indies after Steve Waugh led Australia to a 3-1 win in the Test series. Im really missing it at the moment. I missed it the other night when Australia had to keep the Windies to about 50 runs and they had three wickets in hand, Warne said. I would have loved to have the ball in my hands trying to get them out.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Show by old club delights Kapil
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  KapilDiego Maradona is Kapils all-time favourite Calcutta: Eleven years ago, cricket icon Kapil Devs desire to generate interest in soccer saw him actually wear the gold-and-red jersey. Today, he is delighted at East Bengals fantastic run in the ASEAN Club Championship.Though Ive watched my old clubs progress in bits and pieces only, Im delighted at where the team has reached. Indeed, if I can, Ill watch Saturdays live telecast of the final (against Thailands BEC Tero Sasana), Kapil told The Telegraph on Friday, when contacted on his cellphone.Laughing, he added: Frankly, I wasnt aware that the present East Bengal side is so good and, surely, the country has been done proud Ive been following (Bhaichung) Bhutias career with some interest but, obviously, the club has other gifted players too. Kapil, it may be recalled, signed for East Bengal on June 22, 1992, and made his debut six days later  as a substitute striker  in an exhibition match versus Mohun Bagan. Proceeds from that game went to a Bangalore charity.The turnout (at the Salt Lake Stadium) was huge, about 60-70,000, and I was pumped up It was, after all, an unusual experience. Sadly, owing to rain, the match had to be abandoned (goalless) midway into the second-half, he recalled.The East Bengal XI included Bhaskar Ganguly, Tarun Dey, Christopher Kem and (captain) Kuljit Singh. Kapil, in fact, had replaced Kuljit and was on the turf for 27 minutes.Incidentally, state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty and the late Dipak Paltu Das, a top East Bengal mandarin, were instrumental in getting the (1983) World Cup-winning captain to wear soccer boots for the first time since his schooldays in Chandigarh.Till cricket became the driving force, I was quite obsessed with soccer. I began as a full-back, moved to the goalies position and, then, was promoted as a forward As you can make out, I was an allrounder in soccer as well, Kapil quipped.[In more recent times, of course, golf has become his priority-sport.]Despite being a passionate Brazil fan, Kapils all-time favourite remains Argentinas (1986) World Cup-winning captain Diego Maradona: At different times, somebody or the other stands out  for instance, nowadays, Ronaldo is hot property  but, for me, Maradona is the greatest.Asked whether he had a formula for the improvement of Indian soccer, Kapil laughed yet again  Am I supposed to have such formulae? Its best that the pundits answer that However, I do feel that self-belief makes the difference If you believe you can do it, you will.Having beaten the odds to make the title-round, East Bengal shouldnt be short on self-belief. If not anybody else, energy-oozing coach Subhas Bhowmick will ensure that.  Copyright

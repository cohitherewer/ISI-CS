		 Tuesday, September 09, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Berlin: Former Olympic champion Dieter Baumann has announced his retirement from athletics at the age of 38 after a frustrating showing in the 2003 world championships in Paris.				 																																	Baumann pulled up in the mens 10,000 metre final frustrated at his lack of energy but afterwards denied suggestions that he would hang up his running shoes.				 																																	However, the 38-year-old German has now called time on his glittering career with victory in the 5,000 metres during the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 his crowning moment				 																																	Baumann will run his final race in Tubingen on Sunday.				 																																	New Delhi: Indias racing star Karun Chandhok was virtually thrown out of the championship race as he failed to finish the 21st race of the British Formula 3 championship (scholarship class). With only two rounds remaining, Chandok now trails the race leader Ernesto Viso by over 20 points and has very little chance of winning the championship, a press release said here on Monday. 				 																																	Viso leads the standings with 303 points followed by Steven Kane with 301.5 and Chandhok with 282.5 points.				 																																	The former Asian Formula champion, who was placed third on the starting line, made a great start to the 21st race in Leicestershire on Saturday only to retire after the first curve due to suspension damage. But he came back strongly in the 22nd race on Sunday and maintained his composure to finish second behind Ernesto Viso.				 																																	Sydney: Shane Warne was the highest profile athlete banned as sports doping offenses increased by 36 per cent in Australia in the 2002-2003 testing period, the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) said on Monday.				 																																	ASDA chief executive John Mendoza said 28 athletes returned 34 positive cases in the year till June 30, an increase from 20 athletes returning 25 positive cases in the previous 12 months.				 																																	This trend clearly indicates Australia is far from immune to doping, said Mendoza, adding that the latest cases involved more serious substances.				 																																	Berlin: Franz Beckenbauer has said he can understand Germany coach Rudi Voellers wild attack on his media critics, which was front-page news in the soccer-mad nation on Monday.				 																																	The usually mild-mannered Voeller lost his cool after Saturdays 0-0 draw with Iceland in a Euro 2004 qualifier, telling German television that their commentators analysis of a dismal German performance was a load of crap.				 																																	I can understand it because I often enough talked back in similar situations, said Beckenbauer, who coached Germany to their 1990 World Cup triumph and captained the side to victory in 1974.				 																																	You feel like a hen that wants to protect its chicks, Germanys most respected soccer personality wrote in a column in Mondays Bild.				 																																	Voeller also received support from Berti Vogts, who had a difficult relationship with the media when he coached Germany. 				 																																	Nottingham: Notts County, the worlds oldest professional soccer club, was saved from extinction on Monday after receiving a loan from Nottingham City Council. County had to raise  250,000 before the meeting of the Football League to prove they could fund a rescue package.  The City Council has agreed to underwrite a  loan to the Notts County Supporters Trust to ensure they  meet the amount required.

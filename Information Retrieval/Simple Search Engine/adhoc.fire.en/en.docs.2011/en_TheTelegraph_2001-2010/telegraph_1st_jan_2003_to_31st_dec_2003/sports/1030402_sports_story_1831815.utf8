				 																																	Copenhagen: Former Denmark midfielder Stig Tofting will not appeal against his four-month jail sentence for assault, Danish TV2 said, quoting Toftings lawyer Anders Nemeth.				 																																	Tofting has chosen to accept both his guilt and the penalty, TV2 said on its Internet web site.				 																																	The 34-year old was sentenced in October for an assault in a Copenhagen restaurant last June. Tofting had said he intended to appeal against the verdict and had been scheduled to appear in a Copenhagen court on April 10.				 																																	He last played for English premier league Bolton Wanderers in January. Tofting played a pivotal role in the Denmark team at the 2002 World Cup finals where they reached the second round. 				 																																	Bangkok: Two father-and-son combinations are set to tee off at this weeks Thailand Open as the tournament returns to the Asian PGA Tour schedule after an absence of two years.				 																																	Suthep Meesawat, the first Thai player to win his national Open in 1991, will be competing in the event along with his 18-year-old son Prom, who is regarded as one of Thailands brightest prospects.				 																																	Prom won last years junior world championship by two shots at Torrey Pines in San Diego, following in the footsteps of former winners Tiger Woods, David Toms and Nick Price.				 																																	The other father-and-son duo playing is Somsak Srisanga and his son Somkiat, although they have previously played tournament golf together.				 																																	That is by no means the end of the family affair highlighting this weeks event as three sets of brothers are also taking part  Manus, Manoch and Saneh Saengsui, Preecha and Sanchai Senaprom and Surachai and Chawalit Plaphol.				 																																	The Thailand Open has not been held since 2000, because of sponsorship difficulties, but is now back on the agenda for the 37th time.				 																																	Paris: IOC president Jacques Rogge on Monday gave his approval to the logo for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, the design an elongated take on the five Olympic rings.				 																																	Rogge said the logo of the XXIX Olympic Games was young, dynamic  bringing together the historical and cultural heritage, as well as the future of China.				 																																	The official unveiling of the emblem, whose design was selected from 2,000 entries, will take place in Beijing on May 25. 				 																																	London: Indian fast bowler Zaheer Khan will not be playing for Warwickshire as an early season replacement for New Zealands Shane Bond after talks between them failed.				 																																	The county is now looking for other cricketers to play for them after Zaheer Khan, their first choice as cover, could not confirm due to his international commitments. We got to the stage of discussing a contract with Zaheer Khan, but similar to Shane he could not commit because of international duty, Warwickshire operations manager Keith Cook told the BBC Sports website. 				 																																	Montevideo: Uruguays Victor Pua was considering an offer Monday to coach Bolivia in the South American World Cup qualifiers which are due to begin in September. Pua, who led his own country at the 2002 World Cup after steering them to the finals for the first time in 12 years, said the offer was tempting.				 																																	 n Football: Best of Spanish league, from 6.00 pm on ESPN n Badminton: Sudirman Cup, from 11.00 am on STAR Sports n Golf: Royal Challenge Indian Open, from 4.30 pm on STAR Sports n General: Sportsline, live from 7.30 pm on STAR Sports

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI wont play ball with Cup sponsors
Mumbai: In an apparent bid to punish the sponsors whose damage claims are likely to deprive the Indian cricket board of its World Cup profits, the BCCI on Wednesday indicated that it might not consider these companies while awarding sponsorship rights for international matches in the country in future. [That the BCCI could even go to the extent of blacklisting companies whose actions adversely affect India, was reported by The Telegraph a couple of months back itself.] The BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said that it would be increasingly cautious in its dealings with these companies in the aftermath of the Player Terms controversy which saw the World Cup sponsors asking for damages from the Global Cricket Corporation, a move that resulted in Indias guarantee money being withheld by the ICC. The BCCI has to be cautious before approaching the companies that failed to support us before and after the World Cup in South Africa because we personally feel that the Indian players demands were not wrong, Dalmiya told reporters after a meeting of the BCCIs marketing committee here. The lucrative three-year contract for rights of Indias international fixtures at home is up for renewal and the likes of Pepsi and LG, who had asked for compensation for the breach of contract by the Indian cricketers during the World Cup, might find themselves losing out. The three-year contract with Pepsi has just ended and we discussed a few companies, though I cannot name the parties as the final decision for the coming years would be taken during the finance committee meeting in Calcutta next month, Dalmiya said.

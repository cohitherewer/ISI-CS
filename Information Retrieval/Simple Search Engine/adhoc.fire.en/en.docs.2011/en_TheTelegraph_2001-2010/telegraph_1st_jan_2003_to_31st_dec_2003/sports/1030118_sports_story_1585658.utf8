The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 18, 2003 				 One has to accept the bad phases: Sourav
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT				 	 sourav																								Calcutta: For the Indian cricketers, moments of comfort continue to be at a premium. 																								If the tour of New Zealand wasnt bad enough, it took captain Sourav Ganguly almost 30 hours (including seven in transit) of travelling to get home from Auckland.																								Im tired, but its nice to be back, Sourav told The Telegraph early Friday, soon after touching down in the city.																								Lucky that the teams Singapore-Mumbai flight landed ahead of schedule, or else the captain would have had to spend much of the day in Mumbai  making the journey home that much longer.																								In any case, with just 12 days remaining for the Indians departure for the World Cup, theres little time to work towards getting the act right.																								Sourav, however, is hopeful that the New Zealand-show wont continue to weigh down his team.																								Ive asked the boys to make the most of this small break and look ahead After all, bad phases do occur and one has to accept that, he remarked.																								After a couple of days off, Sourav intends working out in earnest  in Calcutta itself.

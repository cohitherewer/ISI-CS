The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Zimbabwe name weak squad
Harare: Without the services of four key players Zimbabwe revealed a weakened squad Tuesday for their ten-week tour of England beginning May 3. The question whether the team could provide a serious challenge for England and South Africa was raised as the squad prepared to leave Harare for London April 30. The list of 20 does not include Zimbabwes world-rated batsman Andy Flower. And fast bowler Olonga has retired from international cricket. Opening left-hand batsman Alistair Campbell, who has the third best one-day batting average for Zimbabwe, remains out of favour after criticising selection policy. And Guy Whittall has retired early at 34 years old. Zimbabwe are obliged to bring in several inexperienced players and one debutant, quick bowler Vusimuzi Sibanda. THE TEST SQUAD Heath Streak (capt), Tatenda Taibu (vice-captain), Grant Flower, Dion Ebrahim, Mark Vermeulen, Barney Rogers, Sean Ervine, Andy Blignaut, Mluleki Nkala, Stuart Carlisle, Ray Price, Travis Friend, Vusimuzi Sibanda, Douglas Hondo, Douglas Marillier. Additional players for the one-day matches: Gary Brent, Waddington Mwayenga, Stuart Matsikenyere, Charles Coventry, Richard Sims.  Copyright

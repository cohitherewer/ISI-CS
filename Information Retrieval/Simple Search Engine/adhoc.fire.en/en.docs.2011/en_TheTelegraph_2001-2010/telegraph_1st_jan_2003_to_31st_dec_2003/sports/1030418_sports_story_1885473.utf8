The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Another big loss for Bangladesh
 - Dhaka Tri-series Jacques Rudolph  during his 81 against Bangladesh on Thursday. (AFP)  Dhaka: Half centuries from  Jacques Rudolph and captain Graeme Smith helped South Africa  reach 261 for five in their tri-series match against Bangladesh  on Thursday. Bangladesh were all out for  168 in 49 overs, ensuring a 93-run win for South Africa.  Alok Kapali (71) played a lone hand, while Shaun Pollock  (3/17) and Andrew Hall (3/32) were the wreckers-in-chief. Pollock claimed his 273rd victim,  taking him past Allan Donald as South Africas highest one-day  wicket-taker.  The visitors looked on course  to reach the final against India after left-hander Rudolph  scored 81 while Smith had set the tone with an aggressive  67 to set the hosts a stiff target. Shaun Pollock then smashed an  unbeaten 38 from only 20 balls to help his team rattle up  69 runs for the unbeaten sixth wicket with Neil McKenzie  (39 not out). South Africa, at 216 for five  after 46 overs, looked set to finish with a modest total  before Pollock and McKenzie tore into the mediocre medium-pace  attack of the hosts. Bangladesh struck early when opener  Herschelle Gibbs inside-edged a Tapash Baisya delivery on  to his stumps without scoring. Smith and Rudolph steadied  the innings as they raised 101 runs from 124 deliveries. But Bangladeshs slow bowlers,  off-spinner Sanwar Hossain and leg-spinner Alok Kapali led  an impressive fightback in the middle overs to expose the  traditional weakness of South African batsmen against the  turning ball. Rudolph cut out any risk to raise useful partnerships  with Boeta Dippenaar (16) and Mark Boucher (12) before both  fell to Kapali, who returned two for 40 in his 10 overs. (REUTERS) Copyright

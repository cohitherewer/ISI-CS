The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I felt no pressure: Sehwag
Dhaka: Having registered a victory in his first match as captain, Virender Sehwag said on Wednesday that captaincy did not put any additional pressure on him and he felt quite relaxed right through the match. I did not feel any pressure of being the captain. I just played my natural game, Sehwag said. The stand-in captain was full of praise for youngsters Gautam Gambhir, Avishkar Salvi and Amit Mishra and felt they had the potential to succeed. I think its good to give the youngsters a chance in such matches. They will learn. I must say they all played very well. Sehwag, who made 43, dismissed suggestions that he was not concentrating hard enough to convert starts into big scores. I play my natural game and always try to get big scores. It is not that I lose concentration. Bangladesh captain Khaled Mahmud was happy that his team was showing signs of improvement but said there was a lot of hard work to be done before they could really compete with the stronger teams. It is good that we could reach the 200 mark for the second time. That should give us a lot of confidence. Our batting still needs a lot of improvement, Mahmud said. (PTI)  Copyright

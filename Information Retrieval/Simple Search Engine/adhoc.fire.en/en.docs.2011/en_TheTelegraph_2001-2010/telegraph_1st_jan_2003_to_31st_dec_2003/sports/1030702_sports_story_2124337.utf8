 NZ coach resigns
Christchurch: Denis Aberhart has left his job as coach of New Zealand. I was not guaranteed a further term with New Zealand Cricket (NZC) and another exciting opportunity presented itself and is likely to be confirmed later in the week, Aberhart said in an NZC Board statement on Tuesday. Aberhart, who has been coach since 2001, said his new job would be outside cricket.  NZC chief executive Martin Snedden is likely to announce Aberharts replacement next week.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

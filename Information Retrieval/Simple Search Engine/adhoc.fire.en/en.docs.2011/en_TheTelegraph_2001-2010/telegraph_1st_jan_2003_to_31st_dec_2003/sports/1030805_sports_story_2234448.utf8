The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Record entries
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Corporate head honchos will be at it again, at The Telegraph Merchants Cup, from Tuesday to Friday, driving through the serenity of the Tollygunge Club golf course, presented by Royal Challenge. And this time it is bigger than ever before, with a record 78 teams taking part overall. This includes 40 teams of quartets in the Merchants Cup proper and 38 more who cant make a full complement of a team but are eager, nevertheless. In the fray will be the defending champions Eveready Industries, led by 1982 Asian Games gold medallist Lakshman Singh, along with Aditya Khaitan. With Tata Steel missing Alan Singh and Madhya Bharat Papers missing Jaideep Chitlangia, the champions could have a smooth ride. Then there are the corporate superstars, like Peter Mukerjea of STAR television, Sashi Ruia of Essar, Ranjan Bhattacharjee and Vijay Mathani of Color Plus among others taking to the greens as well. Other top companies like ITC, Tata Tea, BM Birla, the RPG Group, Standard Chartered Bank, J. Thomas, Carritt Moran, George Williamson (Assam), McLeod amp; Co, Tinplate, Goodricke will also be in fray, apart from new entrants South Eastern Railways, Visa International, Duncans and NG Industries. The Merchants Cup is a four round open strokeplay event, but the Challenge Cup is a format where three out of four scores on an abridged stableford format will count. Tiger Sports Marketing will be organising the meet. There are daily individual prizes, along with many team prizes.  Copyright

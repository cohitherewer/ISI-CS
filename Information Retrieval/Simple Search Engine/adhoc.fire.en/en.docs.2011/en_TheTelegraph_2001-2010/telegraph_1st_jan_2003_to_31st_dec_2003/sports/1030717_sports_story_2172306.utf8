 British tennis looks to Sweden 
London: British tennis chiefs looked to the land of Bjorn Borg and Stefan Edberg on Wednesday to help produce the next home-grown Wimbledon champion. The Lawn Tennis Associations (LTA) director of performance, David Felgate, announced the appointment of Swedish coach Martin Bohm to work with two of Britains top prospects, and John McEnroe might also become involved in the LTA revival plan. Martin has worked with Magnus Norman, Thomas Enqvist, Thomas Johansson  all of the top guys, Felgate said. He is a top coach working with the Swedish Tennis Federation for many years. Martin is now coming to Britain to work with two of our players, Alex Bogdanovic and Martin Lee, Felgate said. The model for him working with these guys is no different from when I was working with Tim Henman at a young age. Players cannot do it on their own, they need help. Bohm is part of a shake-up Felgate feels is necessary if Britain is to become a force in the tennis world. (Reuters)  Copyright

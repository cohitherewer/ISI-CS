The Telegraph - Calcutta
 War over wicketkeeping berths on the cards
 - TEST SERIES DOWN UNDER l Captain Sourav for five quicks in squad of XVI  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Deep and Parthiv: Will both make it? Bangalore: Unless a compromise is reached before the national selectors meet to pick the XVI-strong Test squad for Australia, on Thursday morning, the deliberations may see an all-out war over the two berths for wicketkeepers. Team India will feature in four Tests Down Under, with the first (Brisbane) beginning on December 4. The last (disastrous) tour was back in 1999-2000. There should be little disagreement over XIV positions but, then, things could get out of hand over the two keepers... I suppose naming even the World Cup XV was easier, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. Eventually, Parthiv Patel and Deep Dasgupta  whose last India appearance was 21 months ago  may get the nod, but Ajay Ratra and rookie Thilak Naidu have backers in Norths Kirti Azad and chairman Syed Kirmani (South), respectively. Apparently (and with good reason), captain Sourav Ganguly has been pitching for Deep, who is also being viewed as the third opener after Virender Sehwag and Akash Chopra. However, the groundwork for his recall has to be done by Easts Pranab Roy. Clearly, he must have the support of Kiran More (West) and Centrals Sanjay Jagdale. For Pranab, its going to be a night without sleep. But, then, thats the price he has to pay for backing players who dont exactly make his job simple. As one of Pranabs colleagues put it: Its going to be a tough morning for all of us but, more so, for him... One understands coach John Wrights views could either improve or hurt Deeps chances. Like the captain, Wright is a co-opted member of the selection committee. Only, if both Sourav and the coach jointly ask for a player, Kirmani amp; Co. will have to fall in line. In fact, they should, as the accountability-axe hangs over the coach and captain. As of late Wednesday, the squad looked set to comprise seven batsmen (including Yuvraj Singh), two wicketkeepers, two spinners and five quicks (including Lakshmipathy Balaji). It wasnt confirmed, but Sourav has let it be known he is keen on five new ball bowlers. One cant argue with that. Assuming that Balaji does make it, the forthcoming tour will be his first-ever with Team India. Ditto for Chopra, who did well in both Tests versus New Zealand. Of course, theres bound to be a discussion over some of the other berths and in contention are opener Sadagopan Ramesh, middle-order bat Hemang Badani and quick Irfan Pathan, who was outstanding in the recent U-19 Asia Cup. By the morrow, though, others may join this list. Its not clear, however, how a Ramesh can be accommodated if the XVI is going to have two wicketkeepers... Is there a dark horse? Yes  Murali Kartik. Meanwhile, the selectors will also be picking the India A squad for the forthcoming home series against Sri Lanka A. For obvious reasons, though, all the attention will be on the big boys shortlisting.  Copyright

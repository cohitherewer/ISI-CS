 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: Mohun Bagan denied Thursday a report that P. Surchand Singh, charged with possessing heroin and handed imprisonment by a Thane court, had ever played for the club.																								According to a report, Surchand claimed to have played for Mohun Bagan after being arrested.																								Club secretary Anjan Mitra said his claim was false. No player by this name has ever played for us. If he has shown any identity document as our player, he must have forged it.																								Surchand was sentenced to 14-years of rigorous imprisonment, apart from a fine of Rs. 2 lakh.

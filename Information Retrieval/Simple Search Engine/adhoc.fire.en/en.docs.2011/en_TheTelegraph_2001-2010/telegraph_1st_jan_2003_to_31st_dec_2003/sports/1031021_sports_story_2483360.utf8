The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Clean sweep by Australia
Sydney: World record holder Matthew Hayden blasted yet another century to steer Australia to a nine-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the second Test on Monday and a 2-0 series sweep. Chasing 172 for victory, Australia wrapped up victory after tea on the fourth day at the Sydney Cricket Ground, losing just one wicket after Hayden and Ricky Ponting went on a run-feast. The pair shared an unbroken partnership of 151 in less than two hours to guide Australia to their victory target inside 30 overs. Hayden was unbeaten on 101 to finish the series with 501 runs at the remarkable average of 250.5. Hayden cracked 11 fours and three sixes to post his 16th Test century , earning him the Player of the Series award while Ponting was named Man of the Match. Earlier Zimbabwe were dismissed in their second innings for 266 after resuming on 151 for four. Later Australia skipper Steve Waugh said of the rivals: They played very well They have enough (talent) there but they need a bit of help through the ICC and relaxing some of the regulations.

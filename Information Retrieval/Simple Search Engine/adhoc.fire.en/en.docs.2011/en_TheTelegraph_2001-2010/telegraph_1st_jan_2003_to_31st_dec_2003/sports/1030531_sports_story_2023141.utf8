The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Milan target Becks
 Beckham Rome: Champions League winners AC Milan want to sign Manchester United midfielder David Beckham for next season, according to Fridays Gazzetta dello Sport. The paper said a preliminary agreement between the Italian club and the player is already in place and that Milan president Silvio Berlusconi has made the England captain his priority this summer. Barcelona are also believed to be interested in signing the 28-year-old superstar, who is expected to fetch around 30 million on the transfer market. Italys best-selling sports daily said United want to offload Beckham before his contract expires in 2005 when he would become available on a free transfer. That would give manager Alex Ferguson the necessary funds to strengthen the squad and boost their chances of winning next seasons Champions League. The Gazzetta reasoned that if Beckham was sold United could make a move for Leeds Uniteds Australian midfielder Harry Kewell and Paris St Germains Ronaldinho.  (AFP)  Copyright

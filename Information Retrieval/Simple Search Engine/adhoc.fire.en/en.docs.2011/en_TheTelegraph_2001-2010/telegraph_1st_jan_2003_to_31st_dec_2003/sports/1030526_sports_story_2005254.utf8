The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Clay boost for Hewitt
Duesseldorf: Lleyton Hewitt and Carlos Moya have both taken a confidence boost from the World Team Cup, even though neither of their teams made the final. Chile won the final against the Czech Republic on Saturday as Fernando Gonzalez and Nicolas Massu teamed up to beat Jiri Novak and Radek Stepanek in the deciding doubles for a 2-1 victory (as reported in Sundays Late City edition). Fernando Gonzalez was the events most successful player, winning all eight of his matches. But Australian Hewitt and Spaniard Corretja found personal success to carry them confidently into the French Open, starting Monday. Hewitt, the top seed in Paris, was unbeaten in his three singles clashes, including a notable victory over Carlos Moya. Corretja, a former runner-up in Paris but who has been out of form for much of this year, sparked into life with two singles wins out of three. For world No. 1 Hewitt, the victory over Moya, a man he had lost to four times in succession, was a step forward as he bids for a first French Open title. Its a nice little confidence boost, Hewitt said. I feel like it was probably one of my best matches on clay and to know you can match it with these guys just a few days before the French is a good feeling. But I dont think you should read too much into it as far as next week is concerned. Hewitt, who has been dealt a tough draw in Paris with several top claycourters in his quarter, will privately be delighted at breaking his run of four straight defeats against Moya, who has been in top form in 2003. Moya lost two of his three singles matches in Duesseldorf but said he was still confident of a good showing in Paris, five years on from his first, and only, Grand Slam title. I have won a lot of matches this year, which will help me in Paris, Moya said. To win in Paris would be really great. It would be the best achievement for me, and a great story as well, after I was injured and then came back. I feel like Im playing well. Im not saying Im going to win the French Open but if I get a bit lucky then I have a chance. Corretja began the week in woeful form and low on confidence. An opening day defeat by Todd Martin did not help but something clicked in Spains next matches as he beat Radek Stepanek and Wayne Arthurs.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

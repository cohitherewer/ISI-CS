The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies, NZ for tri-series in India
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Johannesburg: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will host a tri-series in October-November, with Australia and New Zealand as the invitees, either before or after the three Tests against New Zealand. The tentative dates have been worked out, but will be finalised after discussions with the concerned boards, BCCI secretary S.K. Nair told The Telegraph on Sunday afternoon. While the Australians last visited India exactly two years ago, the New Zealanders last trip was in late 1999. Meanwhile, Nair confirmed that India will participate in the tri-series in Bangladesh, slated for mid-April. Bangladesh and India apart, the meet will feature South Africa. Nair, by the way, couldnt throw any light on the delayed Asia Cup except that it could be held in Colombo.  Copyright

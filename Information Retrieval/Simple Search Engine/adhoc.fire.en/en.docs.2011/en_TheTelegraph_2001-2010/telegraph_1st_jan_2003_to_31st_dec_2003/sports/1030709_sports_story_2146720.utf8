 Sharapova ready for the Williams 
Moscow: Russian teenager Maria Sharapova, who caused quite a sensation by reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon, thinks she is ready to take on the Williams sisters. Of course. I have to be ready, the 16-year-old was quoted as saying in Tuesdays Sport-Express newspaper when asked if she could challenge the powerful Americans. Sharapovas dreams of becoming the first wildcard to reach the womens quarter finals at Wimbledon were ended when she lost in three sets to compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova. World No. 1 Serena Williams beat her elder sister Venus 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 in the Wimbledon final last Saturday. Im not that interested (in) whats going to happen five years from now, tomorrow is more important for me, Sharapova said. My goal is to be No. 1 in the world and Im working hard to achieve my dream.

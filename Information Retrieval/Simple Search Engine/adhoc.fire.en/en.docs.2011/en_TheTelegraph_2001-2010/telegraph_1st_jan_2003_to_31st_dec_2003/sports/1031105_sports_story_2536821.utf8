The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, November 05, 2003  Bangalore gears up for Nov. 8 start 
 BY OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT				 										The Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) is all set to make the scheduled start to its winter campaign on Saturday, despite the clouds of uncertainty had threatened to disrupt the season on Monday afternoon. 				 										A prolonged tri-partite meeting among trainers, owners and BTC officials, that lasted till late in the night, however, yielded favourable results when the club offered minor concessions pertaining to medication rules, particularly about the administration of the class IV drugs. Accordingly, trainers of horses testing positive in that category will be treated leniently for the first two offences before a axe falls on them heavily. Among other things, trainers and owners have been demanding major concessions against those found guilty of using class IV drugs.

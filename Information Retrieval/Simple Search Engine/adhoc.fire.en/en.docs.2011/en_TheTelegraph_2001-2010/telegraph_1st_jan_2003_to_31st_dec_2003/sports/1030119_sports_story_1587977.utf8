		 Sunday, January 19, 2003 				 MP shoot out Kerala for 156
																								Kochi, Jan. 18 (PTI): A brilliant bowling spell by medium-pacer Harvinder Singh Sodhi (3/26) and leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani (3/52) helped Madhya Pradesh bundle out Kerala for 156 in the first innings in the semi-final of the Ranji Trophy plate championship Saturday.																								At stumps on the opening day, Madhya Pradesh were 21 for no loss.																								Keralas total would have been further abysmal but for a 65-run partnership for the seventh wicket between Ajay Kudua (33, 101b, 4x4) and Vipin Lal (28 n.o., 90 b, 4x4).																								Earlier, Hemant Kumar (43, 79 b, 6x4) and Sreekumar Nair (16) put on 49 runs for the fourth wicket after the side was tottering at 31 for three. Electing to bat, the hosts surrendered the initiative, losing wickets at regular intervals.																								BRIEF SCORES																								Kerala 156 (Hemant Kumar 43, Ajay Kudua 33, Vipin Lal 28 n.o., H.S. Sodhi 3/26, N. Hirwani 3/52, Y. Golwalkar 2/33). Madhya Pradesh 21/0.

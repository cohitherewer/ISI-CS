The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Moya hopes to be third time lucky
 Carlos Moya Mumbai: World No. 7 Carlos Moya of Spain said on Tuesday he is hoping to be third time lucky in the Tata Open tennis championship to be held in Chennai from January 5-11. The first time I played in Chennai, I suffered an injury and last year I lost a close match. I hope I will be lucky this time, Moya said in a tele-conference. I think Tommy Robredo, Rafael Nadal (both Spaniards) and reigning champion Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand are my strongest opponents in this years tournament, he said. Speaking about the recent Davis Cup final, where Spain lost to Australia, Moya said: Though I managed to beat Mark Philippoussis in the only win, I would have been happier if my team had won. Winning the Davis Cup for my country is more important to me than any personal glory. Asked whether he had played any of the Indian players, Moya said: I have played only Mahesh Bhupathi in singles and he is a good player. I have heard Indias No. 1 player Leander Paes is a good player too but he is more into doubles these days. Moya said tennis has taken Spain by storm and more and more youngsters are taking to the sport. There are as many as ten Spaniards in the top 25 draw at Chennai as well.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Van Vuurens rare feat
Windhoek: Rudie van Vuuren will become the first man to play in the cricket and Rugby Union World Cups when he pulls on his Namibia jersey next month in Australia. The 30-year-old flyhalf represented Namibias cricket team as a seam bowler in the sports showpiece tournament in South Africa and Zimbabwe earlier this year. I dont think about the achievement everyday. There are other important things to worry about, said Van Vuuren. He has played 27 times for Namibias rugby team. Namibia are in group A along with defending champions Australia, Ireland, Argentina and Romania.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

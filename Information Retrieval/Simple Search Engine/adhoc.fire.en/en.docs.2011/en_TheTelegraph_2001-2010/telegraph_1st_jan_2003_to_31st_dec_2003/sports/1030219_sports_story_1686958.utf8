 Warne stares at two-year ban 
Sydney: Australian leg-spinner Shane Warnes career may well be over after his second urine sample also tested positive for the banned diuretics, a leading newspaper reported Tuesday. The 33-year-old Warne faces a maximum two-year ban from international cricket if proved guilty of the doping offence under the Australian Sports drug Agency (ASDA) rules. The ASDA, which carried out the tests, is believed to have informed Warne about the result of the second test Monday, Herald Sun reported. Under the ASDA protocol, Warne has seven days to ask for an internal inquiry or appeal to the administrative appeals tribunal, the paper said. The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) was awaiting official confirmation of the report. Warne was tested on January 22, a day before he announced to quit one-day cricket after the World Cup. The news of his testing positive for diuretics came into light just hours before Australia was to play their first World Cup match against Pakistan on February 11 in Johannesburg. The ACB has charged Warne with its most serious doping offence  breach of Clause 4.1b of the anti-doping policy  use of a prohibited method. The charge is severe because it considers that the diuretic was used to alter the integrity and validity of Warnes drug sample. Under the ACB policy, the mere presence of the diuretic is enough to constitute an offence and his motive for taking it is irrelevant.  (PTI)  Copyright

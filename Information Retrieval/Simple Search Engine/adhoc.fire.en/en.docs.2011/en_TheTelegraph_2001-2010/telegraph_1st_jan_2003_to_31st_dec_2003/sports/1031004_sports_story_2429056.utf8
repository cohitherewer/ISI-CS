The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Consolation win for India
 Avishkar Salvi and wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik appeal for a verdict against Pakistans Aamir Sajjad in Colombo on Friday Colombo: Avishkar Salvi and Irfan Pathan shared seven wickets as India defeated Pakistan by five wickets in the Emerging Nations Trophy on Friday. Salvi claimed four for 16 and Pathan three for 35 to restrict Pakistan to 177 for nine in 50 overs. The victory, however, was futile, since India had already been knocked out of the tournament. India suffered a middle-order collapse after a brisk start, but an unbroken 82-run partnership for the sixth wicket between Vinayak Mane (50 not out) and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (39 not out) guided India to their first victory of the tournament. India had earlier lost to Sri Lanka and Pakistan while their third match against the hosts was washed out by rain on Thursday. Put in to bat, Pakistan made a disastrous start when they lost Babar Naeem in the third over, the left-hander edging Salvi to wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik. The Salvi-Karthik combination worked again in the seventh over when the other opening batsman Usman Tariq edged one to the keeper. Shahid Yousuf (60) waged a lone battle, and in the end, the 31-run eighth wicket partnership between Yasir Arafat (16) and Mansoor Amjad (27 not out) boosted the Pakistan total. The Indians began strongly with captain Gautam Gambhir (22) and S. Vidyut (25) adding 52 runs in seven overs for the first wicket. But Vidyut, Gambhir and Ambati Rayudu fell in quick succession, leaving India on 58 for three. Two more wickets, Arjun Yadav and Karthik, fell by the 19th over, to leave India precariously placed at 95 for five. The experience of former international Shukla came in handy at this stage as Bengal allrounder provided the ideal support to Mane, the Mumbai batsman. (PTI)  Copyright

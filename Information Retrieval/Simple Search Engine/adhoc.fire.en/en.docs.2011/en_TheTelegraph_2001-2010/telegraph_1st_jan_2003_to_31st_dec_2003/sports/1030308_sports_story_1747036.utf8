The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Change request formally rejected
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Cape Town: As expected, the World Cups Organising Committee has formally announced that it wont be possible to reschedule the second (day-night) semi-final, in Durban on March 20, into a day game. That no change would be effected, despite a request from the Board of Control for Cricket in India, was reported by The Telegraph Friday itself. The Indians wanted a change as form and the carried-over points position suggests they will head for Kingsmead as either the second or third-placed team in the Super Six. The other semi-final, in Port Elizabeth (March 18), will see the No. 1 and No. 4 sides battle it out. That the conditions can adversely affect the team batting second is what got India to put in a request.  Copyright

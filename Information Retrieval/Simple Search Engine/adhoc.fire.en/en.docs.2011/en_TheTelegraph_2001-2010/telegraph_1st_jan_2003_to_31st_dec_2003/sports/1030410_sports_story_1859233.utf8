The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Modest show by India
Jodhpur: On a rather dull day for the highly regarded teams, Vietnam continued their supremacy with a 2.5-1.5 win over India B in the mens second round of the Asian team chess championship here. Vietnam (6.5 points) are ahead by two points over top seeds China. India A are 1.5 points adrift of the leaders with seven more rounds remaining. India C, surprisingly, hold the lone second spot with six points. Among women, China shot into sole lead with an emphatic 2-1 win over Vietnam. The second place is held by India A and Iran, just a half point behind. Vietnams Dao Thein Hai and Koneru Humpy had a good fight before the Indian captain resigned after 45 moves from middlegame complications. For India B, R. B. Ramesh failed to capitalise on an advantageous position and settled for a draw after 53 moves with To Hoang Thong, while double GM norm-holder Tejas Bakre accounted for Ibraev in a one sided game. The surprise victors of the round were the players of the India C team that beat Kazakhstan 2.5-1.5 with three games ending decisively. (PTI)  Copyright

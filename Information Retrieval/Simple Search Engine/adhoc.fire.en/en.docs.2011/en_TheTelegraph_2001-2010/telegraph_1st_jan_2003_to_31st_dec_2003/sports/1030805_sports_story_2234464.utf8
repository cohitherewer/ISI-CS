The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Tuesday, August 05, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Chennai: Calcuttas Saurav Ghoshal and New Delhis Gaurav Nandrajog, who turned professional squash players this year, will participate in the PSA Tournament being held in New Zealand from August 7 to 17, according to N. Ramachandran, secretary general, Squash Rackets Federation of India.				 																																	Indias No. 1, Ritwik Bhattacharya, would also be competing in the North Island championship (Wakatane  August 7 to 10) and Royal Oak Open (Auckland  August 14 to 17).				 																																	Beijing: The star-studded Real Madrid team pocketed a neat $ 2.2 million for a single outing here during the weekend, much higher than the earnings of the World Cup champions Brazil when they visited China earlier, the state media reported Monday.				 																																	For Real, the Beijing stop got the ball rolling nicely for their Asian promotional tour, the China daily commented.				 																																	The leading European club pulled in $ 2.2 m for the 90-minute hit-out here and another $ 77,000 during their week-long high-altitude training session in Kunming.				 																																	Brazil pocketed $ 1.3 m for a match in China earlier this year, the paper said.				 																																	Raleigh: Olympic and world 100 metres champion Maurice Greene will miss the prestigious Zurich meeting on August 15 to concentrate on the Paris world championships starting in the following week.				 																																	The US sprinters manager Emanuel Hudson said that Greenes coach John Smith thought the meeting was too close to the championships.				 																																	John likes to have a 10-day window before the championships, Hudson said. Instead Greene, who has been struggling with tendinitis in his right leg, will run a relay at the Berlin Golden League on August 10 as part of his preparation for Paris.				 																																	Monaco: Monacos Italian striker Marco Simone says he is hopeful of joining Lazio. They called me two days ago, Simone said.Their offer looked very interesting and I told them I was ready to move. Im now waiting for Monaco to close the deal.				 																																	The 34-year-old international, who helped the club clinch the French title in 2000, has fallen out of favour with the principality club and has hardly played in the last two seasons.				 																																	Monaco narrowly avoided relegation to the second division last season after successfully appealing against a decision to demote them on financial grounds. On Saturday the club announced that midfielder Marcelo Gallardo was returning to his former team River Plate in Argentina. 				 																																	Stockholm: World 100m record holder Tim Montgomery makes his return to the track here Tuesday as he sharpens his preparations for the world championships.				 																																	The 28-year-old American has not raced since finishing second behind European champion Dwain Chambers in Glasgow on June 29, returning home after his and girlfriend Marion Jones first child was born. Montgomery has not been in form this season, timing a best of 10.04, a far cry from the 9.78 he ran in Paris last September to set the record. But his manager Charles Wells believes that the sprinter will show no ill-effects from his long lay-off.				 																																	Beijing: David Beckham may have left China but his diehard fans still want to get up close and personal, turning out in force for an auction of items he used while in Beijing, including his pyjamas and bedsheets.				 																																	One fan paid $ 341 for the Chinese pyjamas, bedsheets, towel and pillow cases the celebrity superstar used during his three-day stay at the sumptuous Beijing Hotel, a hotel staff said. Another who just couldnt get enough of the married father-of-two shelled out $ 340 to stay in the room Beckham used, which usually goes for $ 240.				 																																	Berlin: Bayern Munich need Roy Makaay and should give Deportivo la Coruna what they are asking for, says Franz Beckenbauer. I am certain that we need a third top striker alongside Elber and (Claudio) Pizarro for a long season, said the former Bayern great, now the president of the clubs supervisory board, in his column in Mondays Bild. Whether we have to pay a million more is not important. Such a player would be an enrichment for Bayern and the entire Bundesliga. The German champions have been chasing the Dutch  striker for weeks but are still fighting with his Spanish  club over the transfer fee.

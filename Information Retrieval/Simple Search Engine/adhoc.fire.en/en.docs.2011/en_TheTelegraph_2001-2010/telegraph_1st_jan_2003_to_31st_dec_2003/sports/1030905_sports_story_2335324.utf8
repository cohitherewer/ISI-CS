The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla let initiative slip
 - Final Test - Rafique claims five for 36
 Khaled Mahmud (4/37) in action on Day II of the third Test in Multan on Thursday Multan: Bangladesh bowled out Test opposition for under 200 for the first time ever but then let the initiative slip against Pakistan after 18 wickets fell on a dramatic second day of the third Test on Thursday. Left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique took five for 36, his third five-wicket haul in an innings in his last four Tests, and skipper Khaled Mahmud four for 37 to dismiss Pakistan for 175 and give the tourists a first innings lead of 106 runs. They extended that to 183 by the close, losing quick wickets before limping to 77 for four in their second innings. If we can get another 120 runs tomorrow than we stand a better chance of winning this Test than Pakistan, said Mahmud, who had taken just one Test wicket with his gentle medium pace before the start of the three-match series. Bangladesh, resuming on 248 for six, lost their last four wickets for just 33 runs in the morning with Shabbir Ahmed doing the main damage with three wickets in six balls. The home side have already won the series after victories in Karachi and Peshawar.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

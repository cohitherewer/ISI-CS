 Hashim ends 37-yr wait
Birmingham: Malaysias unseeded Hafiz Hashim caused a major upset and took brotherly revenge by winning the All England badminton title on Sunday, deposing top seed and champion Chen Hong 17-14, 15-10 in 53 minutes. In Saturdays semi-finals, Hashims older brother Roslin was knocked out by Chen as the Chinese world number one reached his third All England final in succession.Roslin failed to see out the retribution wrought 24 hours later by his sibling because he had to catch a flight to London en route to home and was forced to leave the arena after the first game. Hashim is the first Malaysian to win the crown since 1966 and his victory will be feted in a country that has had to play second fiddle in recent years to such powerhouses as China and Indonesia.  The womens title went to fourth seed Zhou Mi who beat Xie Xingfang, seeded six, 11-6 11-5. Xie had beaten world champion Gong Ruina, another Chinese, on Saturday but the final proved to be one step too far. (Reuters)  Copyright

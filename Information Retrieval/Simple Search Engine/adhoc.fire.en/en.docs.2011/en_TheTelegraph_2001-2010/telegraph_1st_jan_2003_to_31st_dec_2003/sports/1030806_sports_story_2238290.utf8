				 																																	Oslo: Norwegian javelin thrower Paal Arne Fagernes, who finished fourth in the 1999 world championships, died in a car crash this week.				 																																	It is with great grief that we have received notice that a versatile and talented athlete has passed away, the Norwegian Athletic Association said on Tuesday.				 																																	Fagernes was ninth in the 2000 Olympic final, having set a national record of 86.74 metres in qualifying. But the 29-year-old courted controversy and was sentenced to jail for disturbing the peace shortly before the Olympics in Sydney.				 																																	He was left out of the 2001 world championships in Edmonton, Canada after showing up drunk for an interview and was also fined for taking cocaine and amphetamines.				 																																	Berlin: Bayern Munichs hopes of renewed success in Europe received a boost on Monday when they clinched the purchase of Dutch international striker Roy Makaay.				 																																	The German champions said they had reached agreement with Deportivo la Coruna and last seasons Spanish first division top scorer with 29 goals would sign a four-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee.				 																																	Bayern had been chasing the Dutchman for weeks but were fighting with his Spanish club over the transfer fee.				 																																	Ahmedabad: Former Test batsman and India coach Aunshuman Gaekwad has been appointed coach-cum-consultant of the Gujarat Ranji Trophy team, sources said here on Tuesday.				 																																	The Gujarat Cricket Association decided to appoint a reputed coach following good performances in the Ranji Trophy and under-19 meets.				 																																	Athens: Three years after Sydney was hailed for staging the first Green Games, environmental groups have accused the Olympic movement of taking a giant step backwards in Athens.				 																																	Dimitris Caravelas, head of Greeces Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), said Athens Organisers (ATHOC), the Greek government and the IOC had already won the Games first gold medal  the award for missed opportunities in 2004.				 																																	They dropped the ball in Athens. Lip service was paid to environmental protection and a golden opportunity has been missed, he said.				 																																	Manchester: Manchester United have reportedly told Chelsea they will have to increase their $ 23m offer for Juan Sebastian Veron if they are serious about securing the Argentinian midfielders services.				 																																	United have indicated they are willing to sell 28-year-old Veron but are holding out for a substantial increase on the current bid.				 																																	Madrid: Atletico Madrid have continued the renovation of their squad with the signing of former Barcelona midfielder Nano. The 21-year-old, who was once regarded as one  of Barcelonas brightest prospects, has signed a three-year  deal with Atletico after being released by the Catalans.  He is the sixth new recruit to arrive at the Calderon since  the end of last season.

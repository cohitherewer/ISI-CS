The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India, NZ get wet welcome
 FROM OUR CORESPONDENT Chennai: After the sunshine in Mohali, rain welcomed the India and New Zealand teams here late on Tuesday evening. The venue for Thursdays tri-series opener, in fact, has been witnessing heavy showers over the past couple of days. Though the met office hasnt yet predicted a washout, more rainfall over the next few days is not being ruled out. As precaution, almost 90 per cent of the Chepauk ground has been covered with special attention to the 22-yard strip. If conditions dont improve substantially, the teams may have to do away with practice at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium and prepare to work out at the MRF Pace Foundation ground. Rain at this time of the year is not unusual here and according to locals, it was due after a few dry spells. That, however, has not deterred enthusiasts from making a beeline for tickets and a sellout is very much on the cards, provided the raingods relent.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, January 23, 2003  Nationalistic may strike 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 Prakash				 										Calcutta: It is going to be a clash of champions  of today and of yesteryears  in the 2,000m Indian Champion Cup that takes the prime-slot in Thursdays eight-event race-card. However, one is tempted to ignore the past Derby winner Alternator, and also a giant killer named Allodium, because of their advancing age, thus narrowing down the selection to the likes of Calorescences, Nationalistic and Another Times. It is because, Calorescence has hit a purple patch. Her last two wins have been smashing. But it may not be easy this time for the Vijay Singh-trainee as she will be up against Nationalistic who missed the city Derby, over 2,400m, narrowly because of his known discomfort over the staying trip. With distance cut down by two furlongs and weight for age allowance in Razeen-Vision Of India four-year-olds favour, it may turn out to be an interesting battle between the two fine horses. Another Time, the winner of the Oaks and a good fourth in the Derby, too, stakes her claim but it looks like Daniel Davids Nationalistic who may just about prevail.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw nos:				 										1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Chief Minister calls on Sourav
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: For the first time since his (second) surgery on the left upper thigh, Sourav Ganguly had VIP visitors at the city clinic where he has been admitted since Saturday morning. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, along with Asok Bhattacharya, dropped in to meet the regular India captain this evening. So did BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who spent half an hour with the skipper. Bhattacharjee and the minister for urban development spent about ten minutes with Sourav. I told him we are all praying for a speedy recovery so that he can get back on the field soon, the CM said before leaving the clinic. The doctors supervising Souravs post-operative treatment seem to be in no hurry to issue a discharge certificate. According to a bulletin signed by all four on the medical panel, Sourav needs two weeks of regular dressing. Considering the size and magnitude of the wound, he needs at least two weeks of regular dressing, the doctors said. It was learnt the panel feels Sourav should stay at the clinic for at least this entire week so that the dressing could be done in a sterile environment. The doctors are not in favour of their patient going home soon and driving down to the clinic to get the dressing done daily.  Copyright

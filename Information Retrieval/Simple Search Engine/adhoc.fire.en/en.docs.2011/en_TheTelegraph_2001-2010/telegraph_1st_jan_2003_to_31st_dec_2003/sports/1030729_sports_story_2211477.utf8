The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla get snared in the MacGill web 
 - Visitors batting a lot better than some recent efforts of West Indies and Pakistan: Waugh  Australian captain Steve Waugh with the trophy after a clean sweep of the two-Test series against Bangladesh on Monday. (AP) Cairns: Stuart MacGill took ten wickets for 133 as Australia beat Bangladesh by an innings and 98 runs before lunch on the fourth day of the second Test on Monday to clinch the series 2-0. Bangladesh, who were sent in to bat and made 295, had resumed their second innings on their overnight score of 106 for four after Australia had declared on 556 for four in their first innings. Leg-spinner MacGill (5/56) and paceman Jason Gillespie (4/38) each took three wickets in the morning session as Bangladesh were bowled out for 163 in 58.4 overs. MacGill was named Player of the Match and the Series, in which he claimed 17 victims. It was a sweet moment for the New South Wales and Nottinghamshire bowler who grabbed his second 10-wicket haul in his 25-Test career to take his tally to 131 victims. Warnes shadow Australia captain Steve Waugh said MacGill was not simply a substitute for Shane Warne. Hes taken over five wickets per Test match. Its probably about time that everybody realised that he is not in Shanes shadow, Waugh said. Waugh (156 not out), Darren Lehmann (177) and Martin Love (100 not out) each made centuries in Australias innings. Australia won the first Test inside three days by an innings and 132 runs in Darwin while for Bangladesh, Mondays series defeat extended their record to 20 losses and one draw in their 21-match history. Waugh said Bangladesh deserved Test-playing status. The games most-capped player, most successful captain and second-leading run-scorer backed the Asian nations continued improvement despite a poor record. I thought their batting was a lot better than a lot of efforts by the West Indies in recent years and Pakistan in Sharjah, Waugh told a news conference. Australia bowled Pakistan out for 59 and 53 in the second Test at Sharjah last October to win by an innings and 198 runs. To be none for 50 on that first morning, we expected to have three or four wickets at least, Waugh said. They left the balls a lot better, their body language was good. They took balls on the body and didnt flinch, so I think they are well on the way. Its easy to write off a side because theyve lost by an innings again (15th time). I know as a player they have improved a lot. Sanwar action reported Bangladesh spinner Sanwar Hossain has been reported to the ICC for suspect bowling action. An ICC statement said the umpires in the second Test against Australia in Cairns had reported Hossain after reviewing footage of his action on the second day. (Reuters)  Copyright

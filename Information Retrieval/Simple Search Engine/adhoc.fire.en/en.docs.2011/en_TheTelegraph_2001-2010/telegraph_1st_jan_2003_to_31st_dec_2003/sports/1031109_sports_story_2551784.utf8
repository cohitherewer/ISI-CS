The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Rameez to feature in Pak sponsors promo 
	 - Warne may also be seen in campaign  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Rameez will become first chief executive to feature in sponsors promo Calcutta, Nov. 8: Rameez Raja is on the verge of creating history: He is becoming the first chief executive of a national cricket body  in this case, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)  to appear in a promo for the teams sponsor. Yes, Ive accepted an offer from Pepsi In fact, the endorsement will be shot in Mumbai, tentatively later this month, Rameez, a former captain, told The Telegraph this evening. According to Rameez, who was contacted on his cellphone in Lahore, the promo is likely to feature Shane Warne as well. Warne, it may be recalled, is serving a one-year ban for using diuretics. The Australian wizard will remain off cricket till February. The sponsors, one understands, have taken this unusual course as Pakistan cricket is in the midst of gradual rebuilding and currently short on marketable stars. Shoaib Akhtar would have been a strong candidate but, then, he keeps getting involved in controversies. In the present times, then, he isnt suited for endorsements. The Wasim Akrams, of course, have retired. Besides having been an outstanding opener and a member of the Imran Khan led 1992 World Cup-winning side, Rameez has always come through as Mr Clean. Clearly, his image is a plus. It wont be Rameezs debut promo, though. In his playing days, after all, he endorsed shoe major Bata and ice cream manufacturer Yummy. Incidentally, there wont be any conflict with the PCB as Rameez isnt drawing even a token salary. Moreover, he will be promoting cricket, thereby helping the national body. Meanwhile, Rameez confirmed that mileage-driven Indian companies are queuing up to sponsor next years tour of Pakistan by Team India. The last visit was in late 1997, when three ODIs were played. This time, for a million reasons, interest is bound to be that much more Among other benefits, the PCBs coffer is going to overflow.  Copyright

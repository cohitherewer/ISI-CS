The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jones predicts gloom
Lahore: Former Australian batsman Dean Jones on Tuesday warned that his countrys domination of world cricket would fade once the teams ageing stars retire. They are having their time in the sun but trust me in a few years some other team will over run them, Jones said. I do fear, once you lose Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne, we would come back to the pack quickly. Jones, who played 52 Tests and 164 ODIs in the 1980s and 1990s and was a member of the 1987 World Cup-winning squad, said most other countries are fielding younger sides. A lot of their (Australias) guys are over the age of 30, Pakistan have two and South Africa one in (Shaun) Pollock, so dont worry it will come, said Jones, who is here as a television commentator. Since the 1999 World Cup triumph in England, Australia have had an imperious run in world cricket, registering a world record by winning 16 Tests in a row.  Nine of Australias 14-man squad for the Zimbabwe Test were aged 30 or over.  (AFP)  Copyright

 Parents praise Dravid commitment
			Bangalore: Rahul Dravids parents were overjoyed after their son guided the Indian team to a historic win over Australia in the second Test at Adelaide Tuesday. Sharad Dravid, Rahuls father, said after the first two days of the Test, he expected India to salvage a draw at the most and not pull off such a remarkable victory. We are very, very happy, the proud parents told reporters at their Indiranagar residence here. We hope he will continue to do well in future. Dravid scored 233 in the first innings and stood firm in the second, remaining unbeaten on 72, guiding his team to a four-wicket victory. A beaming Pushpa, Rahuls mother, said: I feel proud because he has made the country proud. She said the joy expressed by Indian supporters at Adelaide and cricket fans back home doubled her happiness. Sharad was quick to point out the good performances by V.V.S. Laxman, Ajit Agarkar and Anil Kumble too. One man cant win the match. It is team effort, he said.  On his sons success, Sharad said  he had commitment and patience and is a hard worker, and  he has the ability to take good and bad points in life in  his stride. (PTI)  Copyright

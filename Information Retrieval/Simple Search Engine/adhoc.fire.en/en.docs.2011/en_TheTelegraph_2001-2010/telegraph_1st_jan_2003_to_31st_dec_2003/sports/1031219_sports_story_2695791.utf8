The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan outplay Vasco 2-0
 - Rennedy, Barreto strike as Goan side is reduced to 10  men in second half
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Vasco custodian Rogerio  Ramos collects the ball before Jose Ramirez Barreto  can do any damage at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday.  Barreto did ultimately get a goal after Rennedy Singh  (below) had given Mohun Bagan the lead. Pictures by  Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: There is no end in sight to the infighting among Mohun Bagan officials, but the players just refuse to be caught in the crossfire despite being affected vis-a-vis their payments. Led by the redoubtable Jose Ramirez Barreto, the green-and-maroon brigade shrugged off a sluggish start to outplay Vasco 2-0 in their National Football League (NFL) clash on a cold, overcast Thursday afternoon at the Salt Lake Stadium. Rennedy Singh and Barreto struck on either side of half-time to give Mohun Bagan their third win in five games which took the two-time champions tally to 10 points. Vasco, on the other hand, lost their unbeaten status to stay put on six from as many matches. Barreto, returning to the XI after sitting out the Indian Bank tie with a double booking, bowed to his coachs wishes and started as a striker next to Ashim Biswas with fellow-Brazilian Eduardo Rebeiro in the middle of the pitch. But it didnt take long for the wily Barreto to realise that his presence in midfield was much more important than Eduardos. Once Barreto took charge of orchestrating operations from the business zone, Mohun Bagan looked a different side. Of course, Edson Castro helped Mohun Bagans cause to a great extent by picking up two yellow cards within a span of seven minutes and getting sent off moments before half-time. Edson first held on to Barretos shirt quite needlessly and then felled Mehtab Hossain who was shadowing him. Castro, the Brazilian element in the Goan outfit, showed some fine skills in the opening half-hour when Vasco had more of the exchanges. With Dennis Cabral and the speedy Levy Coelho getting their act together, the Mohun Bagan defence had a torrid time  especially with Leonardo de Almeida struggling to settle down in his new role of central defender. Goalkeeper Prasanta Dora did well to keep out an Amechi Tochukwu shot. The Nigerian striker then failed to utilise a Leonardo error, while Edson headed inches off target after outjumping Mohun Bagans Brazilian defender. The only combined move the home team managed in that period was set up by Barreto. Ashim Biswas would have found the mark had the powerful shot not struck Seby Dias hand. Referee L.G. Sharma dismissed appeals for a penalty as it wasnt an intentional hand-ball. Ashim later picked up a booking for retaliating against Sushant Mathew who landed a painful blow on his knee. The first goal came against the run of play. Rennedy, getting the ball via Barreto-Ashim, drove it smartly only to see it come off the base of the right post. Luckily, the ball returned to him and this time he made sure of hitting bulls eye. Going into the second session a man short, Vasco found the going tough. To their credit, they didnt go into a defensive shell but lost out in the midfield where Rennedy and Hardeep Gill were bent on giving Barreto solid support. Mohun Bagan went two up in the 54th minute off a dream three-man move. A Gill crossfield pass was picked up on the left by Rennedy and the resultant low cross was directed to the goal by a diving Barreto with his head. An exhibition of misses followed with Gill and Eduardos substitute Hardeep Saini playing the lead role. Vasco coach Derrick Pereira was satisfied with his teams showing, considering they were down to 10 men for over 45 minutes. The red card to Edson shouldnt have happened, felt Pereira. The first foul didnt deserve a yellow and the second one was flashed by the referee only after being prompted by assistant referee (K. Shankar). And Ashim wasnt sent off for retaliation Theres no consistency in our supervision, the former India player rued.  TEAMS MOHUN BAGAN:Prasanta Dora,  Babun Kar, Harpreet Singh, Leonardo de Almeida, Rishi Kapoor,  Mehtab Hossain, Hardeep Gill, Eduardo Rebeiro (Hardeep Saini,  66), Rennedy Singh (Sunil Chhetri, 89), Ashim Biswas (Palash  Karmakar, 69), Jose Ramirez Barreto.

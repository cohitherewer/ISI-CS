The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, January 05, 2003  Network for Derby 
 BY STAR RACER				 										CALCUTTA racing				 										Calcutta, Jan. 4: Its going to be a close contest between Network and Another Time in the Kingfisher Calcutta Derby Stakes, the star event in tomorrows race-card. Both champions in their own right, have climbed to the top from their respective pools. It was the impressive victory of Network, in the 1,600m Calcutta 2,000 Guineas, that made one sit and take notice of the Vijay Singh-trained horse. But Doubting Thomasses sown seeds; questioning about the staying prowess of the Twist And Turn-Net Net Net son. However, their doubt is not totally unfounded as Network, in the past, had failed in his only attempt to do justice over a 2,000 metre trip. And going by the same logic, the additional two furlongs in the city Derby could weigh heavily upon him.				 										 Another Time is no ordinary filly. She is improving with each run. Having gone down to Romantic Notes in the 1000,. the Steinbeck-Alarming daughter avenged her defeat in the Ladies Derby, the 2,400m Calcutta Oaks. Therefore, she scores on Network on the endurance point. But a Derby is neither judged by the speed nor it is all about stamina. It is a blend of the two elements and in right ratio.				 										However, Network can not be writen off on one failure over the staying trip. The Vijay Singh-trainee is class by himself and his recent workouts over Derby trips were far too impressive compared to the Daniel David-filly. who has successfully tested herself over the slated trip, albeit against her own sex. Masculine power, however, is not to be undermined. If Another Time long to win the Derby so does Romantic Notes who has been discarded by Cristopher Alford in preference to her stable-mate Network. Cristopher has been in the business for long. He is unlikely to make such a silly decisions.

 Humpy keeps sole lead
Kozhikode: Top seed Koneru Humpy maintained sole lead with five points at the end of as many rounds in the 30th national womens A chess meet on Tuesday. After getting the better of S. Meenakshi in a Reti opening in 48 moves in the fourth round earlier in the day, Humpy maintained her winning streak by outplaying Koneru Chandrahawsa in the next round. Engaging Nimzo-Indian defence to Chandrahawsas queen-pawn opening, Humpy won the game in 31 moves. Trailing the leader in the second spot were six-time champion and second seed S. Vijayalakshmi, who is fast returning to form, WGM Nisha Mohota and defending champion and fourth seed Aarthie Ramaswamy with four points each. Tamil Nadus Vijayalakshmi, who earlier beat statemate Y. Prathiba convincingly, took advantage of her opponent Eesha Karvades rook blunder in the 40th move in a Reti opening game to seal the issue in 66 moves. Mohota, the latest winner of the WGM title, found the going tough against the experienced Bhagyashree Thipsay after employing the Sicilian Defence and settled for a draw in 29 moves. Earlier, Mohota had beaten Sai Meera. (PTI)  Copyright

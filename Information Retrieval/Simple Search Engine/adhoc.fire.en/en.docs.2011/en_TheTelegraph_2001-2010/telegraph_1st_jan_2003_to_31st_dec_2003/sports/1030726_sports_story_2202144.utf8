The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Buddhadeb lauds EB
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The city, indeed the country, has been tuned in to East Bengals dream run at the ASEAN Club Championship. The final is on Saturday, but Subhas Bhowmicks team is already flooded with accolades. How can the chief minister of West Bengal be far behind? Lauding East Bengal for their fine show, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: It has created great impact in the Asian countries, I was told by NRIs from that region. I have spoken to Subhas and congratulated him for helping Calcutta rise to great heights in football again. Bhattacharjee added that he will look into the possibility of a tournament with some foreign teams in the city.  Copyright

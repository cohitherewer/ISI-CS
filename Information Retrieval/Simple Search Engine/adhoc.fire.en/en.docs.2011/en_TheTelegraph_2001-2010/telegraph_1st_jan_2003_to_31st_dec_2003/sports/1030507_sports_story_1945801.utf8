 Real take 2-1 lead to Turin
Madrid: Roberto Carlos struck a brilliant but controversial drive from outside the area to earn Real Madrid a 2-1 victory over Juventus in the opening leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday. Real, the reigning European champions, took the lead on 23 minutes through Ronaldo only for David Trezeguet to poach an equaliser for the Italians a few seconds before halftime. Juventus were in charge of the game for much of the second half before Brazilian full back Roberto Carlos controlled on the edge of the box and cracked the ball past Gianluigi Buffon. Several Real Madrid players were in offside positions but after consulting with his linesman, referee Terje Hauge ruled the goal as valid. Real will thus take a slim advantage back to Turin for the second leg but an away goal leaves Juventus still very much in the hunt for a place in the final against either AC Milan or Inter Milan in Manchester on May 28. A precise shot from Ronaldo from the edge of the box after 23 minutes put Real ahead, but David Trezeguet stabbed in the equaliser after a deflected shot from Alessandro Del Piero fell into his path in the 45th minute. Real scored when the ball broke to Ronaldo after Mark Iuliano tackled Fernando Morientes on the edge of the box. The Brazilian striker pounced and without a second thought side-footed the ball in at Gianluigi Buffons near post. Real, the reigning European champions, enjoyed most of the possession in the first half, with former Juventus midfielder Zinedine Zidane a constant danger. Juventus had two clear chances to score a valuable away goal as Reals concentration lapsed, though. Trezeguet hammered a shot just wide in the seventh minute and later Pavel Nedved shot straight at Iker Casillas.  (Agencies)  Copyright

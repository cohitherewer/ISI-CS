 GCA chief found guilty in ticket scam
Panaji: An inquiry commission set up to look into a fake ticket scandal that rocked the Goa Cricket Association, has found former deputy chief minister of the state and GCA president, Dayanand Narve, guilty of being involved in printing, distribution and selling of fake tickets. The commission said he would not be allowed to remain a part of the association. The Pendse commission, which submitted its report to the state cabinet last week, said in its findings that Narvekar along with two GCA office-bearers  Ram Shankardas and Vinod Phadke  was involved in printing, distribution and selling of fake tickets for an ODI between India and Australia on April 6, 2001 at Fatorda. The commission also recommended that the Sports Authority of Goa may consider withdrawing recognition to Goa Cricket Association unless and until the entire managing commission vacates the office.

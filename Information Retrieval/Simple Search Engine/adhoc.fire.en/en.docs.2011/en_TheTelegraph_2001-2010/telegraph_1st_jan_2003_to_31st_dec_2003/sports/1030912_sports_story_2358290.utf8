 Justine accusers retract claims 
Brussels: Accusations levelled by Kim Clijsters camp that US Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne used performance enhancing drugs were retracted on Thursday. Former French Open semi-finalist Filip De Wulf apologised unreservedly for the claims which Henin-Hardenne on Wednesday had dismissed as ridiculous. De Wulf, in an open letter to Henin-Hardenne in the Belgian media, said: Justine, I want to apologise to you. I never wanted my comments to cast a shadow on your fantastic win in New York. The notion of doping never crossed my mind, rather I was referring to energy supplements like creatine to explain your spectacular muscular development. But even this suggestion was too much. I have committed a serious professional error.  The dietary supplement creatine is not a banned substance. Her fellow accuser, Leo Clijsters, writing on his daughters website, said: My response to the question why is Kim now being beaten by Justine is this  dont you see that Justine has gained a lot of power, that shes become stronger and all of that means shes the logical winner.

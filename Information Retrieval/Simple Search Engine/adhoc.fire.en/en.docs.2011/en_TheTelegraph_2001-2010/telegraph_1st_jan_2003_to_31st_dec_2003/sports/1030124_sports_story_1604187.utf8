 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta: Digvijay Singh and Mukesh Kumar carded identical rounds of three-under-par, 67 on Thursday, but the former maintained his three-stroke lead as they pulled away from the rest of the field and set up a title clash at the Royal Challenge Grand Prix. 																								According to information received here from Mumbai, Digvijay maintained his lead with a two-under, 33 in the front nine with birdies on the third and fourth holes to get to 11-under-par for the tournament. The Royal Challenge Grand Prix, Chennai, champion had mixed luck as he holed a lot of crucial par putts but missed numerous birdie attempts. 																								Mukesh also had a similar front nine with back-to-back birdies on the first and second holes, followed by a bogey on the sixth hole where he left his chip short and missed the par putt.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aiming for the quick knockout punch
 - Buchanan has no regrets on leaked letter issue  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  India captain Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble and Sachin Tendulkar during net practice at the MCG on Thursday. (PTI) Melbourne: Quickly landing the knockout punch in the Boxing Day Test is a priority for both Team India and Australia. Only, given the formidable batting, it may not happen as speedily as being plotted  the expected spongy bounce at the MCG notwithstanding. Steve Waugh himself seemed to acknowledge that when, on the eve of his last Test here, he declared: Statistically, both teams have a great batting line-up, possibly the best in history... So, beating the other is a challenge... Actually, beginning Friday, the ten days which remain in this four-Test series should produce the keenest cricket of recent times. Being 1-0 up  something India wouldnt have dreamt of even in the wildest dreams as Australian coach John Buchanan put it  Sourav Ganguly gets a wee bit more breathing space. But, thats about it. He is, of course, primed for potentially the mother of all responses from Steve and his men. Even though the flavour of the season is such, we arent expecting gifts, Sourav told The Telegraph, as daughter Sana excitedly counted the presents received from Santa at the teams supremely luxurious hotel. Needing to win both the third Test and the one in Sydney to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Steve underlined the importance of properly executing plans. He didnt elaborate much, not that he needed to, but speed merchant Brett Lee figures high in his scheme of things. Incidentally, Steves debut was at the MCG 18 years ago, against India, and he remembers having a cocktail of emotions running through his head on wearing the baggy green for the first time. He also felt intimidated by the Kapil Devs. Cut to the present and its to be seen whether Lee, whose debut too was here (in the last Test versus India, 1999-2000), succumbs to the pressure Sourav has been talking about. However, Buchanan maintained the 27-year-old loves it when the heat is on. Moreover, Lee enjoys the role of spearhead. Steve didnt quite get it right when he said India arent accustomed to being ahead in a series overseas, but Sourav and Co. cannot afford to err like they did in Zimbabwe (summer of 2001) and the West Indies (early 2002). Hopefully, the lessons have been learnt. With the Sachin Tendulkar factor looming large, despite a poor run, its interesting that Steve and Buchanan reacted somewhat differently when commenting on the Little Maestro. Oh, I wouldnt say anything as silly as us being on top of him... is what Steve emphasised. Buchanan, on the other hand, pointed out India had been moving away from just relying on Sachin and, that, the others hadnt been ignored in the Australian gameplan. Indeed, the biggest impact has been made by Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman. If Lees comeback, after being out for over two months, is going to give teeth to the Australians, India have been buoyed by Zaheer Khans return. With Ashish Nehra coming through an extensive nets session, after a near miraculous recovery from a swollen (right) ankle, its Irfan Pathan who will miss out. Meanwhile, breaking his silence on the leaked letter issue, Buchanan insisted certain issues needed to be discussed and, with that being done, its time to move on. In Steves view, it was a discussion paper. The coach, who regrets nothing, added he wouldnt hesitate to author another letter if the circumstances so warranted. As he put it: Theres a difference between saying a few words and putting those in writing... Buchanan has a point.  Copyright

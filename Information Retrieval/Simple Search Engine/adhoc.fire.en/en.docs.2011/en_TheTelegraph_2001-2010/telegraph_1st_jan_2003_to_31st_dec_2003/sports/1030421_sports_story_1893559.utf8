 Rupam shines 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rupam Banerjee, who won the mens air rifle open sight and deer shooting events in the state championship on Sunday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: Rupam Banerjee emerged runaway winner in both air rifle open sight and deer shooting categories for men of the 37th state shooting championship which concluded at Space Circle on Sunday. In air rifle open sight, Rupams tally of 342 points was too far away from both his next two challengers B.K. Barua (252) and S.K. Das (238).

A product of Srirampore Rifle Club, Rupam was unchallenged in the meet. He also won gold in open category in last years nationals at Coimbatore as well as in Ahmedabad nationals in 1999.

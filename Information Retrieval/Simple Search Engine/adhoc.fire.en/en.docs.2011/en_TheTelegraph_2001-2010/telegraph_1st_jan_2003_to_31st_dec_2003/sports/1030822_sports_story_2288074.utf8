The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Last stint likely in Australia
 - Srinaths fitness may be assessed after 2-3 weeks  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Srinath briefly dropped in at the conditioning camp on Wednesday  Bangalore: Jawagal Srinath,  who is recuperating from a (right) knee injury, may eventually  make himself available for the tour of Australia from end  November. According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph,  that trip will then be his last association with Team India.  Srinath, who briefly dropped in at the conditioning  camp on Wednesday, is understood to have had a one-on-one  with captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright. Significantly,  both are of the view that the 33-year-old still has some  meaningful cricket left. Meanwhile, Srinaths fitness is likely to be assessed by physio Andrew Leipus after two-three weeks. Apparently, that will be done in the lead-up to the September 10-14 Challenger here. The quick, of course, isnt available for that tournament. Its to be seen, though, whether Srinath makes himself available either for the two-Test series against New Zealand (October 8-20) or the triangular immediately after that (October 23-November 18).  Srinaths last India appearance was during the February-March  World Cup. His debut was back in 1991-92.  Copyright

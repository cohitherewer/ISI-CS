(Reuters) London: After six days of glorious weather, marauding giants, invading Russians, Anglo-Saxon language and a healthy dose of Henmania, Wimbledon enters its second week full of intriguing storylines.Following the first-round exit of mens top seed and defending champion Lleyton Hewitt to towering Croat Ivo Karlovic, the list of possible heirs to his crown is littered with household names and some who could walk through Wimbledon village without receiving a second glance.The womens last 16 line-up, on the other hand, has a rather more familiar feel, with 2002 winner Serena Williams looming large over her rivals  five of whom hail from Russia, including 16-year-old sensation Maria Sharapova.At 33, and the oldest man in the draw, world No. 1 Andre Agassis eyes will be firmly set on next Sundays final.The American knows this could be his last chance to repeat his 1992 triumph, although standing in his way in the fourth round is Mark Philippoussis.Tim Henman is once again shouldering home hopes. Fate has been kind to the amiable Englishman this last week, dealing him a comfortable set of cards, comprising of nobody ranked higher than 131.Henman outclassed Swedish qualifier Robin Soderling 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 in the third round Saturday.The real business starts Monday however when he meets gritty Argentine David Nalbandian.Should Henman survive that test, he will meet either Sebastien Grosjean or French Open winner Juan Carlos Ferrero.Ferrero demonstrated he was more than just a claycourt specialist after beating Armenian Sargis Sargsian 6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 to reach the last 16 Saturday.Im doing well but before I came here I didnt expect a lot and people didnt expect a lot of me either, Ferrero said.The booming serve of Roddick has left a trail of wreckage in the top half and he will need it again to get by Thai Paradorn Srichaphan in Round IV.With Max Mirnyi a possible quarter final opponent and the talented fourth seed Roger Federer scheduled for the semi-final Roddicks drastic improvement under new coach Brad Gilbert will be severely tested.Indians move upFifth seeds Leander Paes and Martina Navratilova defeated Jamie Delgado and Anastasia Myskina 6-4, 6-4 Saturday.

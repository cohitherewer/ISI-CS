The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Cronjes reserve comment 
 - Murder theory - Dr Ali Bacher not convinced by speculative reports in the UK  Media  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Calcutta: The late Hansie Cronjes family has,  for now, decided against reacting to speculation that the  (disgraced) former South African cricket captains death  in an air crash was sabotage-triggered.  According to reports in the UK Media, the June 1,  2002 crash on the Outeniqua Mountain (near George) wasnt  an accident. In fact, the reports quoted an investigator  as saying: A lot of people wanted Cronje dead They feared  he would one day tell the full truth and that many more  would be implicated (in the match-fixing scandal) Its an observation that cant be ignored. Only, the Cronjes are being cautious.  At this moment, neither my wife  (San Marie) nor I have any comment. Thank-you for your call,  but please respect our decision, was father Ewies response  when The Telegraph contacted him at his Bloemfontein  residence on Monday morning. However, Ewie  whose tone suggested he had aged appreciably in 14 months  added: In any case, the (Civil Aviation Authority) inquiry is on Of course, I dont know why it hasnt been concluded. [Intriguingly, lead investigator Dr Andre de Kock has declared its too early to speculate on the reasons for the crash. He himself needs an additional three months to collect details for making an assessment.  Moreover, the last instrumentation  component of the Hawker Siddeley 748 twin-engined aircraft  would only be sent to the US (for tests) late on Monday.  Its a mystery why the Authority kept waiting all this while.  Hansies elder brother Frans, who was the familys public face when tragedy struck, said pretty much the same thing. The one difference being he laughed cynically when his attention was drawn to the murder-theory reports. Today, theres nothing to say But, yes, there could be a reaction in time to come, Frans (a video producer with a religious bent of mind) maintained, when reached for an exclusive comment on his cellphone. Asked if the family would call for the Authoritys report to be made public, just in case there was a move to keep it secret, he replied: First, let the investigation get over Let the inquiry be complete Apparently, till the latest bit of speculation, the Cronjes had reconciled to Hansies death wholly being an act of God. Now, the pain is bound to return. Numerous questions too. Indeed, as a confidant of the Cronjes revealed: I know that many in the family had got around to believing that the time allotted by God for Hansie was over That, on June 1 last year, he simply had to go away from all of us After the sabotage and murder theory, though, the family may question its own beliefs While the family (as of now) is maintaining a no comments stance, former United Cricket Board supremo Dr Ali Bacher isnt convinced by the UK Media reports. Im not privy to the investigation but, from what I understand, conditions werent at all conducive for flying The visibility, it seems, was almost zero that morning, Dr Bacher said, when contacted in Johannesburg.  With that Hawker Siddeley crash leaving no survivors  (both pilots were also killed) and the inquiry tardy, its  debatable whether the truth will ever be out.  Copyright

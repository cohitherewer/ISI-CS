 BRIEFS
 John Toshack believes Manchester United midfielder David Beckham should join the Spanish first division club  should the opportunity arise.However Toshack, who played nearly 250 games for Liverpool before embarking on a successful coaching career that included two stints in charge at the Bernabeu, told BBC radio on Sunday he doubted the move would come off. If there is truth in the rumour that Real Madrid want him then I would advise him, if he has a say in the matter, to say yes, said Toshack, who resigned as coach of Italian Serie B club Catania in January.There are so many positive things, so many positive experiences that he could take from a move to Madrid. He still has probably five years left and, if the opportunity does come up, then I think he should take it. If we are speaking from a purely football point of view, however, Madrid need players more in other positions. I dont think they need Beckham, but these days from 0-2 down to draw 2-2 with Arsenal on Saturday cost one English gambler 3,000 ($4,773)  in a bet that would have won him only a hundredth of that amount.When Arsenal were leading 2-0 midway through the second half the punter from Newcastle staked 3,000 with bookmaker William Hill at odds of 1-100 that they would go on and win the game.He stood to win just 30 but Youri Djorkaeffs neat chip and a late own goal by Martin Keown cost him dear. Another punter, however, remains confident in Arsenals ability to come back from the defeat and overhaul Manchester United for the league championship.He staked 4,000 at odds of 7-4 that Arsenal will retain the title. Manchester United, two points Chris Gayle celebrated his recall to the West Indies team with a13th first-class century for the University of the West Indies Vice Chancellors XI in Saturdays opening day of a three-dayer against Australia.Gayle hit 129 to help the Vice Chancellors XI to a first innings total of 290.However, he shared the spotlight with Australian leg-spinner Stuart MacGill, who captured regular meetings with the organisers of the world championship to discuss safety issues following the death of Japans Daijiro Kato after a crash earlier this month.Carmelo Ezpeleta, the chief executive of Dorna Sports, the managing company of the MotoGP world championship, announced the decision after meeting all the riders on Saturday at the Phakisa Freeway Circuit, which hosts South Africas Grand Prix this weekend. It is clear that 100m freestyle in his age group at the Australian titles in Brisbane on the weekend, three months after a car accident left him in a day-long coma and critically ill. Bobby Jovanovich finished with a time of 54.34 seconds to take 0.02 seconds off the 10-year-old Australian record set by Peter Fisher.Sport on screen

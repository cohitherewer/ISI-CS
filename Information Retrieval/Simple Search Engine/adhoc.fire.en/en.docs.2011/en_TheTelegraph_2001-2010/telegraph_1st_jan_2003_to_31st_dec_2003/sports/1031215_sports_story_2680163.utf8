The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. earn first point
 - National League - Vasco lucky to escape with a goalless draw  BY A STAFF REPORTER  A Vasco defender prevents Mohammedan Sportings Edeh Chidi (left) from gaining possession at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting collected their first point in the National Football League against Vasco at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday, and went home ruing it could easily have been three instead of one. The city team, having lost all three of their previous games, paid the price of failing to convert chances into goals and settled for a barren draw. Vasco, with the coach admitting his team was lucky to get a point, moved to six from four games. Not that Mohammedan Sporting came up with a performance that would delight the fans. The gap between their midfielders and strikers was vast for a better part of the game, and their approach play carried no serious threat. Even then they came close on at least five occasions, Nigerian import Edeh Chidi wasting most of them. Satish Bharti and Dipendu Biswas were also guilty on a couple of occasions. Vasco are yet to form the kind of combination that had kept them in contention for the title till the penultimate round last year. Also, their foreign recruits this time are hardly as effective as the old Brazilian pair of Marcos Parreira and Ruis Wanderley Weis. Mohammedan Sporting took just eight minutes to peep through the holes in the Vasco defence. A corner from the left found Bharti in the clear near the far post and his header from ten yards took a deflection off a defender before going out. There were two more chances for the home team in the next ten minutes and Vascos Brazilian goalkeeper Rogerio Ramos was lucky to survive both in spite of erring in judgement while leaving his line. Both were aimless clearances from the Mohammedan Sporting half, which found the strikers in advantageous positions. After foiling a Vasco counterattack in the 12th minute, Shahnawaz Khan hooked the ball away and Chidi started running for it from midway inside the rival half. Ramos charged out and found himself stranded at an awkward position as Chidi reached the ball first. But the striker ran away towards the corner from where the angle was too tight to shoot home. Ramos was beaten to a similar ball about five minutes later. This time, Dipendu did better than what Chidi had done, but his lob over the advancing keeper was too high. Chidi was the one to blame again in the 36th minute when he failed to control properly with just Ramos to beat, and with ten minutes to go, missed the chance of the day, heading over the bar from seven yards. Vasco coach Derek Perera said later his plan was to go on the offensive, but his team relied more on counterattacks. They hardly had the manpower upfront to make these moves count. Also, their attacks rarely contained the surprise element to trouble the steady deep-defence pair of Hussain Mustafi and Bharti. Mohammedan Sporting coach Shankar Moitra was still counting the positives. At least we made a few openings. This is a plus as is the performance of Mutsafi and Bharti. We should have won here, no doubt. Derek was offering excuses. Our midfield didnt click. Still, getting a point is better than getting nothing. We were fortunate to an extent to get it. But things have to improve in the future.  TEAMS MOHAMMEDAN SPORTING: Gumpe Rime; Hussain Mustafi, Satish Bharti, Madhab Das; Amjad Ali Khan, Amandeep Singh, Rahim Nabi, Khalid Siddique, Shahnawaz Iqbal Khan (Zaheer Abbas, 77); Dipendu Biswas, Edeh Chidi.

Referee: S.M. Balu (Karnataka)  Vijayan stuns Salgaocar JCT survived some scares before squeezing out a stunning 1-0 victory over Salgaocar in another match on Sunday, PTI adds from from Ludhiana. I.M. Vijayan scored the goal in the 17th minute. However, JCTs Ghanaian goalkeeper Mansuru was the hero of the day, saving his team on at least four occasions, including a stunning effort in the dying minutes to deny Jatin Bisht. The win took JCT to seven points from four games. Salgaocar are on six, also after four games.  Copyright

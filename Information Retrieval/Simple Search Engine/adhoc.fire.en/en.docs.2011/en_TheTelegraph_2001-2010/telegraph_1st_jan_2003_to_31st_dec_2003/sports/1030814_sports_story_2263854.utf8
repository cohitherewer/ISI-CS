The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vandana keeps sole lead
 Vandana virtually assured of Gold Division Open title Chennai: Vandana Agarwal of Calcutta put up a creditable performance, carding one over par 73 to tally 148 for two rounds and maintain her sole lead in the South India Ladies Open golf championship here Wednesday. Agarwal was virtually assured of the Gold Division Open title with a clear lead of nine strokes over second placed Pragya Mishra of Delhi who returned a six over par Wednesday for a total of 157 midway through the tournament. Agarwal, who started with birdies on the first two holes and then bogeyed the fourth, fifth and ninth, played her home journey to par by compensating with two birdies on the 11th and 15th. Burt she could not escape bogeys on 10th and 17th. Delhis Meghna Bal continued to lead the handicap category as she played to a handicap of 11 to total 140 for two rounds, followed by Renuka Philip (Calcutta) at 142. Star golfers Shruti Khanna and Anjali Chopra could hardly catch up with the leader after poor first round scores. Shruti failed to recover from her poor first round performance, while the latter pushed herself to sixth spot by returning a decent card of five over 77. Shruti with a total of 163 was in the 11th position. Calcuttas Manavi Halwasiya and Delhis Mayali Talwar were breathing down the neck of second-placed Mishra with identical totals of 158 each, while Sharmila Malick (Noida) was fifth with an aggregate of 160. In the junior section, Mayali Talwar and Manavi have tallied an identical 158 in the gross category, while Meghna Bal remained the leader in the handicap category.  (PTI)  Copyright

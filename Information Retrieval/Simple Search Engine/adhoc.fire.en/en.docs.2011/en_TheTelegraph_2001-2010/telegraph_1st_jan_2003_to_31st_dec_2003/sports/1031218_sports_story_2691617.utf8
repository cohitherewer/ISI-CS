The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies victims of own aggression 
 BY ALLAN BORDER  Dravid nearly never lets the team down It does not get better than what Rahul Dravid did in Adelaide. His batting was outstanding. Everyone has already exhausted superlatives so I would not bother myself with any additional praise but you could be sure my admiration for him has grown tremendously. While his batting is the talk of town, I think his catch of Damien Martyn on the fourth afternoon set up the game for India. Martyn and Waugh had laid the basis of what appeared to be a big stand, recovery was well and truly underway when Dravid stuck his hand out and caught Martyn in the slips. There are moments in a Test, certain twists and turns, which shift the balance. It was one such moment, to be followed up with the catch of Waugh. Dravids rearguard batting in the first innings revived the Indians. His second knock ensured the good work was not wasted. It is good to see good guys do not end up as losers all the time. There is no need to bring Sachin Tendulkar into equation and begin comparisons between him and Dravid. For me, Tendulkar has always been the man towards whom Indian cricket has turned to quite so often in the past. Dravid had been solid but an unsung hero and now he is coming onto his own. He nearly never lets you down. It is quite a contrast to the fate Dravid had suffered the last time around. There was no respite for him with the quality bowling which Australians commanded in McGrath and Warne. I thought he had gone too much into his shell on the previous tour. Now he has matured and plays with the confidence of a grown-up bat. His shot selection was exceptional. V.V.S. Laxman confirmed what a thorn he has been to the Australians. I can not believe only till recently he was not an automatic choice for Indias playing 11. We thought India must have been a tremendous outfit to leave a player of his calibre. He seems inspired by the challenge and reserves his best against the best attack of the world. He might be unorthodox but that too not on the side of erring. The way Laxman attacked the bowling in the second innings when he hit some critical fours in no time, showed the self-belief which is running through his veins. Stuart MacGill played an absolute second fiddle to him. It was engaging stuff. I thought the Australians were victim of their own attacking nature. They were too flamboyant for their own good. They should have given respect to the conditions. It is dangerous to be loose in your methods when things are not suited to your style of play. They should have given credit to the conditions. Even though none of the Indian medium-fast bowlers enjoy a massive reputation, Australians should have been aware young and fresh bowlers could bowl with a degree of edge. The world champions lost a few early wickets and there was no coming back. Usually in the past, Gilchrist or Waugh lifted the side out of mire when wickets fell cheaply. Quite a few times in the past we have seen Australia slip to 265 for five and then Gilly and Tugga took us past 400 at least. There was no such revival this time. Gilchrist made a misjudgement with his sweep. It was particularly distressing to see from an Australian point of view to let Tendulkar take those two wickets with his leg-spinners. Somehow the little genius finds a way to torment us with bat or ball. Australia might have subconsciously underestimated the Indians. They were playing in their own backyard, have been in good form so there could have been a certain degree of complacency. It could creep into your game. But by the evidence of the first two games, it is not what Australia needs in remaining games. I am not too distraught with the Australian performance. They had some poor flip of luck when Williams and Gillespie were missing from the action at critical times. There are no excuses though the better side won in Adelaide. It nicely sets up the rest of the series which could only be good for the game. As Waugh said, Australia must do an India and respond to this challenge. It is apparent Sourav Ganguly and his men have been mentally prepared for this tour and have done their homework. They have a good coach and are bearing the fruits of their hard work. It is for Australia now to pull themselves up from the floor and respond.  (PTI)  Copyright

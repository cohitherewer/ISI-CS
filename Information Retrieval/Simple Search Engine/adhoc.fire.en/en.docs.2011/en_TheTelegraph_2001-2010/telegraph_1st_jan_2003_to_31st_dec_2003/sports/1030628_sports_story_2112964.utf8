The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lanka slip to 150/6
Kingston: Sri Lanka reached a shaky 150 for six a little after tea on the opening day of the second Test against the West Indies Friday. The West Indies won the toss and took wickets at regular intervals to reduce the visitors to a delicate position. Kumar Sangakkara was batting on 47 with Chaminda Vaas on two. Sri Lanka were 77 for three at lunch. Fast bowler Corey Collymore and off-spinner Omari Banks took two wickets each with Vasbert Drakes and debutant Fidel Edwards claiming one each. Sri Lanka lost openers Sanath Jayasuriya (26) and Maravan Atapattu (15) with the total reading 48 and though Sangakkara held one end up, there was no partnership of note. Captain Hashan Tillekeratne was out for 13.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Sunnys dig at Australia  - World champions accused of harming  the game
 BY CHARLES RANDALL IN LONDON Gavaskar is deeply  concerned about the effects of sledging  Australia, the worlds strongest  team, on Tuesday stood accused by an eminent former Test  cricketer of damaging the game through their persistent  abusive behaviour. Sunil Gavaskar, the former India batsman,  did not mention Australia by name or specify incidents during  his Cowdrey Lecture at Lords, but he left no doubt that  he was deeply concerned about the knock-on effect of such  behaviour. He said: Out of a possible 150  Test cricketers from 10 Test-playing countries there are  perhaps not even 15 who indulge in this verbal abuse and  intimidation, but unfortunately most of these belong to  a champion side, and it makes others believe that its the  only way to play winning cricket. Gavaskars remarks carried extra  weight because of his key role in the ICC as chairman of  the playing committee, though his views on nearly every  aspect of cricket have been well aired through his media  work. Gavaskar, the worried former cricketer  and family man, was the person who spoke passionately to  a 350-strong audience gathered by the Marylebone Cricket  Club in a scintillating speech on Tuesday. He claimed that parents were increasingly  reluctant to let their young children play the game because  of growing on-field animosity, reflecting a mean-spirited  attitude permeating down from the top. The decline included  dishonest appealing, cheating by batsmen and a general lack  of respect for opponents. Kids see it on TV from their  heroes and believe that it is part of the game, and so indulge  in it, Gavaskar said. Here it is crucial for the coaches  to step in and tell them, while the kids are at an impressionable  age, that this is wrong and that cricket has been played  for years without indulging in personal abuse. The old adage its not cricket,  which applied to just about everything in life, is no longer  valid  and thats a real pity. In the modern world of commercialisation  of the game and the advent of satellite television and the  motto of winning at all costs, sportsmanship has gone for  six. Now I have heard it being said  that whenever theres been needle in a match, words have  been exchanged. That may be true, but what was banter in  days gone by  and was enjoyed by everyone, including the  recipient  today has degenerated to downright personal  abuse. Sledging, Gavaskar said, was a  modern phenomenon. There is more money in other sports  such as golf and tennis but, thanks to tough laws, one does  not find misbehaviour or bad language there, he said, adding  that great cricket sides such as the 1948 Australians and  Clive Lloyds West Indians avoided verbal abuse. Gavaskar referred to the unpleasant  scenes in Antigua in May when Glenn McGrath, the Australian  seam bowler, squared up to batsmen during the West Indies  victory in one of the great Test matches of all time.  Gavaskar said players used to  have the game as a whole at heart by playing in the right  spirit. Gundappa Viswanath, as Indias captain, once withdrew  an appeal against Bob Taylor because he realised the England  batsman had been given out wrongly. India lost the Test,  but Vishy is remembered for that and loved all the more  for it. As for banter, Fred Trueman was  among the funniest. Gavaskar said he once conveyed the best  wishes of his uncle, Madhav Mantri, to him in he commentary  box during the 1990 India tour. On seeing Truemans quizzical  look, he explained that Mantri was one of Freds four victims  for no runs in 1952.  I wouldnt remember him then,  would I, growled the long-retired fast bowler.

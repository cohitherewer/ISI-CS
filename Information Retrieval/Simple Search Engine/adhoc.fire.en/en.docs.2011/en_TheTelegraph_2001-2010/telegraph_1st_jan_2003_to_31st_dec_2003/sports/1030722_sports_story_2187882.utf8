 Narain fourth in Germany
 Karthikeyan consolidated overall second place New Delhi : Indias leading hope for Formula One, Narain Karthikeyan, finished fourth in the Nissan championships at Lausitz, Germany, but garnered enough points to consolidate his overall second place in the World Series. Starting on the front row along with pole position holder and eventual winner Heikki Kovalainen, Karthikeyan was doing fine Sunday until his car was hit from behind by championship leader Franck Montagny, a press release said on Monday. Karthikeyans car went into a spin and cost him six seconds, which proved crucial in the final analysis. Surprisingly, no action was taken against Montagny. Karthikeyan now has 80 points in the drivers championship, and is a distant second to Montagny who has 168 points after Sundays second-place finish. Karthikeyans next race is at the A-1 ring in Austria on September 21. Karthikeyan, driving for the Tata Carlin team, had recently propelled himself to overall second position with two successive podium finishes at the Monza circuit in Spain. Karthikeyan had driven a superb race in one of the worlds fastest circuits paying no heed to his back problems. With Montagny having been chosen to drive for the Jaguar Formula One team, the chances of the Chennai-based driver topping the championship were quite high, according to his team manager.

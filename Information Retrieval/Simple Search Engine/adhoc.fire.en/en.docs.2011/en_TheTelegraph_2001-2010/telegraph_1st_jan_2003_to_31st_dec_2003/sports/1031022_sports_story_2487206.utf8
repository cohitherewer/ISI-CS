 Injury rules Youhana out
 Youhana is suffering from a recurrent hamstring injury Lahore: Pakistans Yousuf Youhana has been ruled out of the second Test against South Africa due to a recurring hamstring injury. I am not available for the second Test because I am facing fitness problems, Youhana said. I played this match in some discomfort because Inzamam-ul-Haq was not available. But now I dont want to take any further risks with the hamstring problem, he said. Doctors have just advised rest but have cautioned that if I dont rest I could be out for a longer period of time, Youhana said. Inzamam-ul-Haq, who missed the first test in Lahore also due to a hamstring injury, is fit to lead the team again in Faisalabad. Inzamam is now fit and would be playing in Faisalabad, Pakistan coach Javed Miandad said. As far as Shoaib Akhtar is concerned, he is getting treatment for his hamstring strain and if the appeal against the ban on him is upheld he could play in Faisalabad, Miandad said. Shoaib has been banned for three matches including the second Test in Faisalabad for violating the code of conduct but is also struggling with a hamstring problem that forced him to limp off the field in the test on the fourth day. Pakistan have added Mansoor Amjad, a rookie 19-year-old leg spinner, to their squad for the second Test. Amjads inclusion, despite the presence of the two experienced leg spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and Danish Kaneria, is a clear indication that the Pakistan selectors are keen to build on the success of the spinners in the first Test. Amjad, who comes from the central Punjab city of Sialkot, has yet to play any first class match although he played in all three matches of the recent Emerging Trophy Tournament in Sri Lanka.

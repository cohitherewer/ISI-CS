 Imran tips India to be champions
Johannesburg: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has tipped India to win the World Cup and Sachin Tendulkar as the man to deliver the golden goods. I didnt think any team could challenge Australia at the start of the tournament, they were just too much, Imran said Saturday. But after watching Indias performance over the past few weeks, I think Sourav Gangulys team now has a very good chance of winning the final in Johannesburg, he said. The credit has to go to Tendulkar. His wonderful innings against Pakistan boosted team morale and, in turn, has sparked a fantastic run of form for the rest of the team. Imran, who led Pakistan to the 1992 world title in Australia, also believes that India have the batting depth to win. Against New Zealand on Friday we saw Mohammed Kaif, who wasnt playing to his full potential, come good when India needed him to. This is a sign of a world class team. The Australians will have noted the Indians allround performance. And I think Ricky Pontings team is missing the extra edge in the bowling department that Shane Warne and Jason Gillespie would give them. And the way India are playing, they could well fully exploit that in the final.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latif got suspicious calls in England
 Latif was prompt in informing the ACU Karachi: Pakistan captain Rashid Latif had approached the ICCs Anti Corruption Unit officials in London after receiving suspicious phone calls during the recent ODI series in England, team manager Haroon Rasheed said. According to Haroon, Latif had informed him about receiving telephone calls from some unknown and suspicious persons during the series. Latif told me about this. Later I also spoke to the ACU officials and asked them what the calls were about. They said it was not a serious matter but just a routine check, Haroon was quoted as saying by The News. The manager, who has been with the side since the World Cup, said he felt Latif had done the right thing by informing the ACU officials because players were directed by the ICC to report anything suspicious to the ACU. Players are supposed to report if they get calls from suspicious or unknown people during a series and Latif did what the ICC regulations clearly state. However, Haroon said the letter Latif wrote to the ICC was not discussed with him in detail and the issue came to light only after the tour. I really dont know anything about the letter. But I have informed the board about the telephone calls, he said. Pakistan lost the series 1-2 to England after an exciting final at Lords. Latif, a self-proclaimed crusader against malpractice in cricket, created a stir shortly after the England trip by hinting that match-fixing was still to be eradicated. That statement wasnt received well by the PCB and Latif later apologised.  (PTI)  Copyright

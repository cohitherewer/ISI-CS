The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ghavri wants camp for Bengal quicks
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Karsan Ghavris focus is on consistency Calcutta: Pace bowling has never been the strong point of the Bengal team. And coach Karson Ghavri feels this is an area the CAB can easily look into in the near future. In the mould of the spinners and wicketkeepers camp that took place in the city in August, Ghavri wants a camp for pace bowlers where all the upcoming Bengal boys can work together. It would be great if the CAB can have someone like Kapil Dev or Madan Lal for the camp. Even I can give my inputs if such a camp can be organised, Ghavri told The Telegraph on Monday. Ghavri said he will propose this to the CAB very soon. In fact, this can help us unearth talent not only for Bengal, but also for India, the former left-arm seamer said. The coach also didnt sound opposed to the idea of outstation players in the Bengal team. Why not? If a quality outstation player comes in, the juniors can easily be motivated to perform better, he pointed out. We have a couple of very good youngsters in Subhamoy Das and Amitava Chakraborty. But what they lack is consistency and Ill have to ensure that they score on a more regular basis, Ghavri added. He also felt these boys have to be more choosy in shot-selection. They have to spend more time in the wicket if they are to do well at this level. Consistency is the worry for Ghavri in the bowling department as well. The bowlers and quite good, but they have this tendency of bowling wides and no-balls, which have really hurt our cause in the preparatory tournaments. According to Ghavri, there has been some positives that have emerged from these trips. Beating Karnataka in the final of the KSCA meet was a huge morale booster for the team. He also felt some youngsters have come up really well, like wicketkeeper Aniruddha Roy. He performed quite exceptionally. If Deep Dasgupta doesnt perform well as a keeper, then we can easily play him as a batsman and have Aniruddha behind the stumps. However, he made it sure that Deep will open and do keep wickets in the initial games. He is trying his best to improve as a keeper. I hope he does well, Ghavri added.  Copyright

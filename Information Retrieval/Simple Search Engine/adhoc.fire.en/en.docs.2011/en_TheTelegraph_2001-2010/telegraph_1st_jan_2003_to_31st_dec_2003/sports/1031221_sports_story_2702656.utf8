The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Afridi promises aggro in Indo-Pak matches
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Pakistan A captain Shahid Afridi at a city hotel on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Dec. 20: Im absolutely elated to be back here in India. Its a wonderful experience, not only for me, but for all the guys in the squad, Pakistan allrounder and their A team captain Shahid Afridi said on Saturday, soon after landing in the city for the Asian A championship. Afridi, however, warned they had come here to win the three-nation tournament. We are good exciting side, and there is number of players aspiring to play for the national side and hence it is a good opportunity for them, Afridi told newspersons at the team hotel. He further admitted that he himself wished to get back in the senior side quickly. He, however, pointed out that any Indo-Pak meeting is a platform for developing friendship between the two neighbours. Asked if the meeting of two arch-rivals at the A-level would make the competition less intense, Afridi said: Whenever India and Pakistan play, the match is bound to be aggressive. Afridi added his team had a six-seven day camp before coming to India. I was playing club cricket in Durban. So I came back and joined the camp. Afridi revealed that he came to know about the Indian team from Rohan Gavaskar. Rohan met me on the flight (from Mumbai) and I came to know a lot about the Indian side from him, added Afridi. The Pakistani team, which was to arrive here early morning, reached the city in the evening since their morning flight from Abu Dhabi was cancelled due to fog.  More like a family Meanwhile, India A captain Hemang Badani maintained that winning the tournament is more important to his team than looking for a call-up in senior side. A good performance here may lead you to the team bound for tri-series Down Under. But we are playing Pakistan at home after a long period. So winning here will be our driving force, the left-hander said. Badani, however, pointed out todays Team India is more like a family. Previously the team members used to spend time in groups  four people here, four people there and stuff like this. But Team India is more like a family now. The bridge between seniors and juniors is no more there. I think thats the key to our success in recent times, Badani, himself a Test batsman, opined. For Sri Lanka captain Russel Arnold, another senior side-discard, the meet at Eden Gardens is meant to get back to that side. On the one hand, its all about getting experience and a self-belief that you can too compete at higher levels. On the other hand, we also like to perform and put pressure on the selectors for a senior call-up, Arnold added.  Copyright

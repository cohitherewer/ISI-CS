The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Karnataka hit 411
 Shib Shankar Paul took six for 90 Mandya: Opener Roland Barrington hit a majestic 151 as Karnataka posted a healthy 411 in their first innings against Bengal on Day II of their Elite Group B Ranji Trophy match here Sunday. At stumps, Bengal were seven without loss with Amitava Chakraborty and Deep Dasgupta batting on three each. Resuming at overnight score of 126 for no loss, Karnataka suffered two early blows when opener J. Arunkumar (63) departed after adding 146 with Barrington. Shib Shankar Paul (six for 90) was the most successful bowler for Bengal. He took a return catch to dismiss J. Arunkumar and followed it up with the scalp of Vijay Bhardwaj (2) soon after. In between S. Shinde was run out for nought as Bengal put some pressure on the hosts. But Barrington was well supported by Thilak Naidu (71) and later Sunil Joshi (33 n.o.) also chipped in as Karnataka piled on the runs. The openers sparkling knock lasted for 538 minutes and was laced with 12 boundaries. Sanjeeb Sanyal was the other successful bowler for Bengal taking two for 31.  (PTI)  Copyright

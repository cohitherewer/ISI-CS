 White tests positive again 
Colorado Springs: World 100 and 200m champion Kelli White and five other American athletes have tested positive for the stimulant modafinil, the US Olympic Committee (USOC) announced on Tuesday. White, sprinter Chryste Gaines, hurdlers Sandra Glover, Chris Phillips and Eric Thomas, and hammer thrower John McEwen tested positive for the stimulant at either the US or world athletics championships, the USOC said in a statement. McEwen also tested positive for the designer steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), the USOC said. USADAs (US Anti-Doping Agency) Anti-Doping Review Board determined that sufficient evidence of doping exists to proceed further in seven cases, the USOC said.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

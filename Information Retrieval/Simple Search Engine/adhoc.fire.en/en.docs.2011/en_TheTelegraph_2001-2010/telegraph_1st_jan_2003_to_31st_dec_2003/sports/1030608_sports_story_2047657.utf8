The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Title for Bayview
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bayview Technology, winners of The Telegraph-Haywards 5000 Merchants Cup, at CCFC Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh  Calcutta, June 7:It took  18 days of intense competition and 3888 glasses of fresh  lime soda to determine the winners of The Telegraph-Haywards  5000 five-a-side Merchants Cup football tournament! At the end of it all at CC amp;FC Saturday, the citys most popular corporate sporting event  which attracted 60 teams this year  saw a new champion in Bayview Technology who emerged deserving 2-0 winners over VGP Portfolio in the Main Plate final. Abhishek Deb opened scoring in the first half before Soumya Mukherjee added the second after the breather. It was a pretty one-sided affair between two fairly young sides. Before that, Norinco had overcome Selvel 1-0 in a well-contested Losers Plate final. Sandeep Lahiri scored the winner in the first half. An identical scoreline separated Exide from J. Thomas in the Bowl Plate final with Joy Bose doing the needful.  OTHER AWARDS Most Valuable Player: Abhishek Deb (Bayview Technology). Highest scorer: Christopher Rodriguez (Bates India, 26 goals). Best goalkeeper: Arijit Ghosh (VGP Portfolio). Most sporting player: Siddhartha Mitra (Blue Star). Best veteran player: V.S. Krishna (J. Thomas). Fair Play Trophy: Hyatt Regency.

 Warne to Pound: Mind your business 
 - Its got nothing to do with these guys. Im an employee of CA and weve come to a decision  Warne has not agreed to play any charity  at this stageSydney: Disgraced cricketer Shane Warne has told World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president Dick Pound to mind his own business about his right to train with the Australian team and play charity matches while under suspension for a drug offence. Warnes manager, his brother Jason, said the Australian leg-spinner didnt have immediate plans to play charity games, quashing speculation the 33-year-old had a game lined up for the Lashings club in England on August 18. Australias leading Test wicket-taker tested positive for a banned diuretic in February and was suspended from cricket for a year. Warnes suspension ends on February 10, just ahead of Australias scheduled Test series with Sri Lanka. Cricket Australia initially ruled Warne was ineligible for any form of cricket, but last month an independent arbitrator gave Warne the green light to take part in charity fixtures, forcing the head body to comply. Pound and WADA chief executive David Howman criticised Cricket Australias about-face, describing the situation as a combination of bizarre and anti-ethical to allow a cheater to play. Warne hit back on Thursday, saying in an ABC radio interview: As far as Im concerned its got nothing to do with these guys (WADA). Im an employee of Cricket Australia and both of us have come to a decision. Ive abided by their rules and had an arbitration meeting and they said I can play in charity games, I can train with the team, I can do all those things. Under the ruling by the independent arbitrator, Warne can be invited to train as a guest with the Australian team  which also has WADA disapproval. The first thing is, Shane has no charity games booked in at the moment  no, hes not playing for Lashings, simply because hes unavailable, Jason Warne said. Right from the word go, not once has Shane been told he cant train with the team, as long as hes invited. A couple of people from different countries have rung us about Shane playing in charity games but we havent agreed to play in any at this stage. There has been a lot of stuff in the media... Its been a little bit disappointing, people coming out and making their comments and a lot of them ill-informed, but you just sort of go with it I guess. Warne hasnt bowled a ball since making a guest appearance at a net session for young players in England in June. He has no plans to start bowling again for at least a month in an attempt to time his return so that he is peaking in February. One of Wisdens five cricketers of the 20th century, Warne is concentrating on fitness work. Warne, the second highest wicket-taker in Test history with 491 wickets, will be a commentator for Channel Nine during Australias home Test series against Zimbabwe in October.  (AFP)  Copyright

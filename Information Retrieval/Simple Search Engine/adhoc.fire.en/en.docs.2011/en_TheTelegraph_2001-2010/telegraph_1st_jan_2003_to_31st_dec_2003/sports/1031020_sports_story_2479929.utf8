 Inter sack Cuper
 Inters fightback against Brescia was not enough for Cuper to keep his job Milan: Inter Milan have sacked their Argentine coach Hector Cuper, the Italian Serie A club said on Sunday. FC Internazionale Milano have decided to relieve coach Hector Cuper of his duties, the club said on their official website. Cuper, in his third season at Inter, had been warned by chairman Massimo Moratti that further setbacks would not be tolerated after the 1-3 derby defeat by AC Milan two weeks ago. Assistant coach Corrado Verdelli, who has enjoyed success with Inters youth team, takes charge temporarily for the Champions League game against Lokomotive Moscow on Tuesday Former AC Milan and Lazio coach Alberto Zaccheroni was named the new coach and he will take charge from Wednesday. Although Inter came back from two goals down for a 2-2 draw at Brescia on Saturday, the result, Inters fourth game on a row without a win in Serie A, was not enough to keep Cuper his job. Cuper, a former Argentina central defender, took over at Inter in June 2001 after coaching stints in Argentina and at Real Mallorca and Valencia in Spain. Having taken Valencia to two runners-up spots in the Champions League in successive seasons, he was charged with the task of ending Inters long wait for an Italian title. Inter last won in 1989 and Moratti had tried several coaches including Marcello Lippi, Roy Hodgson and Marco Tardelli in his bid to bring back the glory days of the 1960s when his father Angelo was president and Inter won two European Cups. Despite criticism of Cuper in the press, Inters fans stood by the coach and Moratti insisted that he had faith in Cuper bringing in wingers Andy van der Meyde and Kily Gonzalez during the close season to add the quality wide players that the coach had requested. Cupers Argentine support staff have also been dismissed.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

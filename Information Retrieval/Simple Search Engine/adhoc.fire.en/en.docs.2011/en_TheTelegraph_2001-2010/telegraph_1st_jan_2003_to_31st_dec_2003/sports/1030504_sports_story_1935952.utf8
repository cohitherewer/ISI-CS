 - Third Test l Steve crosses Bradman; Lara indisposed  Steve Waugh, who on Friday crossed Sunil Gavaskar in the list of top Test run-getters Bridgetown, May 3 (AFP): Jason Gillespie claimed the wickets of openers Chris Gayle and Devon Smith in six balls to have the West Indies under pressure on the third day of the third Test at Kensington Oval here today. The West Indies were 210 for four at tea on Day III, still trailing by 395 runs. Ramnaresh Sarwan (31) and Omari Banks (0) were at the crease. The wickets would have added to the misery of West Indian skipper Brian Lara who was confined to bed at the team hotel after having been diagnosed with suspected chicken pox. Gillespie bowled Gayle for 71 and, in his next over, had Smith (59) edging to Adam Gilchrist. The West Indies slipped from 139 without loss to 142 for two in reply to Australias massive first innings of 605 for nine declared. Gayle and Smith had shared in a 139-run opening stand before Gillespie struck in the 24th over of the day. Gayle, who had been dropped on 50 by Gillespie diving forward at mid-on off leg-spinner Stuart MacGill early in the session, looked in ominous touch hitting 12 boundaries. But Gillespie got one to straighten and hit the top of off-stump to end his 189-minute knock. The paceman claimed his 160th wicket in his 42nd Test when Smith, who had a pair of ducks in the second Test in Trinidad, shaped to drive a delivery coming into him and offered an outside edge to Gilchrist. Vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan was elevated to number four in the batting order with Lara laid low. On Friday, Steve Waugh set more personal milestones to become the second-highest run-getter in Test history. The 37-year-old scored his 30th Test hundred Friday (briefly reported in these columns Late City edition Saturday) to overtake Don Bradman as Australias greatest century-maker and lie second only to Allan Border in most runs scored. Waugh survived three dropped catches on way to 115 as Australia battered the West Indian bowlers for 154.3 overs to amass the countrys fifth-highest score of 605 for nine declared against the Caribbean islands. At Day II stumps, Gayle was unbeaten on 47 and Smith, fighting back from a pair of ducks in the previous Test, was on 34. Waugh toiled away on a deteriorating pitch for just over five hours for his 233-ball hundred. Waugh passed Sunil Gavaskar (10,122) as the second highest scorer in Tests with 10,179 runs in his 159th match. Border holds the world record with an aggregate of 11,174. Waugh was out attempting to slog fast bowler Jermaine Lawson out of the ground only to be bowled by one which stayed low. Brian Laras much-criticised decision to send the Australians in to bat on a flat, moribund pitch rebounded spectacularly with his young side once again struggling to avoid defeat.  Copyright

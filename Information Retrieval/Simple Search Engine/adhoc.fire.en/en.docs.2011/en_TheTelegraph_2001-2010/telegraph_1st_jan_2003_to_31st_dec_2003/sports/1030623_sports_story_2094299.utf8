The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Laila triumphs in TKO
Los Angeles: Laila Ali, daughter of Muhammad Ali, said even world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis could not match her eye for the spectacular after she stopped Valerie Mahfood in six rounds Saturday. Ali scored a technical knockout after one minute 17 seconds of the sixth with a barrage of punches to Mahfoods head to regain all three of her world super-middleweight belts on show at the Staples Centre. Ali, fighting on the undercard of Lewis world title clash with Vitali Klitschko, told reporters: (Mine) was the most exciting fight of the night. I am a great fighter and people like me. (Mahfood) is a tough girl but she did not hurt me. I just had to get her out of there. The win took Alis professional record to 15-0, with 12 knockouts, and delighted a sizeable and partisan crowd. The 25-year-old American, who enjoyed an eighth-round technical knockout over Mahfood last year, demanded coverage from Home Box Office (HBO), the television broadcaster with rights to the Lewis-Klitschko bout. Some of Alis previous fights, including one against Jacquelyn Frazier  daughter of Joe Frazier  have attracted television coverage from other broadcasters. Alis fight was preceded by another womens bout, won by American Lucia Rijker over Briton Jane Couch. Lucia and I showed that we have superior skills and that people want to watch us. Laila has been pretty consistent in her bouts. After she stopped Mary Ann Almager in the fourth round of their scheduled 10-round womens super middleweight fight at her legendary fathers Muhammads hometown Louisville February 15, she had remained undefeated in 14 professional fights, Almager was a 10-year veteran in a sport that Ali took up just three years ago. That was Ali[s 11th victory inside the distance and with it she retained her International Boxing Association title.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

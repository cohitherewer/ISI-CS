 SA to send security experts
 Rashid Latif Durban: The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) will send security experts to Pakistan before South Africas tour later this month after government warnings about safety in some areas of the country. The delegation will go through the South African security arrangements with the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) and with the Pakistani police, UCBSA communications director Bronwyn Wilkinson said on Wednesday. South Africa are playing four one-day matches and three Tests between September 24 and October 27. South Africas foreign affairs ministry has advised the UCBSA to avoid sending Graeme Smiths team to Karachi, Peshawar and towns near Pakistans border with Afghanistan. Karachi is scheduled to host two one-day matches and a Test while a Test is to be played in Peshawar during the tour. We will still need advice from foreign affairs on whether they want us to go at all or to avoid Karachi and Peshawar, or to go under special conditions, Wilkinson said.  Latif appeal to SA Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has appealed to South Africa to play cricket in Karachi and Peshawar on their tour later this month despite security concerns. There is absolutely nothing wrong in these two cities. We have just played Bangladesh in Tests in Karachi and Peshawar and everything was fine, Latif said. The South African cricketers are very popular in Pakistan and people want to see them play everywhere. I dont think they would be doing any service to themselves or Pakistan cricket by opting not to play at Karachi or Peshawar, Latif stated.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

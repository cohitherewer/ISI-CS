The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dope officials call again
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Johannesburg: The Doping Control Officers (DCOs) seem to have become hyperactive. Jawagal Srinath and Harbhajan Singh were tested in Paarl, during Indias opening World Cup game (versus Holland), but no DCO paid a visit during the next five matches. Yet, the DCOs came calling in the last two games. According to a source of The Telegraph, Srinath (again!) and Dinesh Mongia were tested in Cape Town, after the first Super Six match against Kenya, while Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh underwent that exercise at the Wanderers, after the game versus Sri Lanka. The selection is random, with the two players (from each team) drawn from a list of 12 (the playing XI plus the 12th man). Given that the Indians have been tested in both Super Six matches, it appears the random test is actually becoming mandatory.  Copyright

 ICC may hold back Kenyas due
Nairobi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) have threatened to withhold the half-a-million dollar two-year development funding to Kenya until a full-fledged national league is approved. The ICC tried to intervene over the last three months in the leadership squabbling between the Kenya Cricket Association (KCA) and the Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association over the running of the 12-team league, scheduled to start on June 29. The staging of the competitive league is part of a joint initiative between the ICC and the KCA to help the east African nation effect transition towards full Test status by 2005. But the ICC global development director Andrew Eade warned Kenya that time was running out. Should the club season be indefinitely delayed, there is every chance that the ICC will cancel the joint initiative before it commences, Eade said in a letter to the KCA. There is little hope for the advancement to Test cricket if the stakeholders of Nairobi cricket cannot even agree on club competition, Eade added. The newly-elected ICC President Ehsan Mani of Pakistan said Kenya faces a major struggle to be granted full Test status.  (AFP)  Copyright

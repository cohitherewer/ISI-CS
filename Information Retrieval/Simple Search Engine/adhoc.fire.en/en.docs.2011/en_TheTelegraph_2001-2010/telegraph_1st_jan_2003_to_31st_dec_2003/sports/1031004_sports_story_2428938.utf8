The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ramesh awaits more chances
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Rajkot: A back injury during Team Indias 2001 visit to Sri Lanka forced Sadagopan Ramesh to make himself unavailable for the tour of South Africa, later that year. As it turned out, the national selectors forgot about him  so much so, he wasnt even among the 36 pre-season probables picked around two months ago. However, in wanting to be fair, the selectors chose the left-handed opener for the India A versus New Zealand game here. On Friday, Day II of the three-day match, Ramesh thanked the quintet by authoring a smart 110 (275 minutes, 206 balls, 19x4). For Syed Kirmani and Co, its really a reminder of his worth. The last two years have been frustrating... Both for me and my family... Now, Ive at least made something out of this opportunity... Its been a long while coming but, hopefully, more opportunities have been created. Who did I think of on getting to hundred? My family and everybody who kept encouraging me, Ramesh told The Telegraph soon after his innings ended in somewhat controversial manner. Later, interacting with the Media, he said: Ive done my job... But, whether Ill make a comeback doesnt depend on me... Is there a sense of relief? Absolutely, but I would have been happier with some more runs... Somewhat emotionally, Ramesh added: I take every day as it comes... Ill be happy if Im back; Ill look to making the most of the next opportunity if Im not... But, yes, Ive tightened my play and big occasions will continue to motivate. In a nice gesture, he was pretty lavish in praising competitor Akash Chopra: He is technically very sound... He did well today (Friday). Ramesh and Akash put on 164 before the latter fell to the only poor shot he played. In Rameshs opinion, the wicket at the Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground has been a good one.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 WI earn consolation win
 - final odi vs Sri lanka l Lara praise for 18-year-old debutant  Romesh Kaluwitharana takes a knock in the face in Kingstown Wednesday. (AP) Kingstown (St Vincent): West Indies beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the rain-affected third and final ODI Wednesday to secure a consolation win in a series they lost 1-2. The hosts took the field after a second rain interruption needing ten off 36 balls under the Duckworth-Lewis system and Ricardo Powell eased them to a winning total of 160 in 36.5 overs  well inside the revised allocation of 42 overs. Earlier, Sri Lanka were all out for 191 in 50 overs. Off-spinner Ryan Hurley and pace bowler Jerome Taylor kept up a sustained attack of accurate bowling, the 18-year-old Taylor completing figures of two for 39 on his international debut. The more experienced Corey Collymore took three for 28 and Marlon Samuels impressed with two fine run-outs. Lara praised Taylor, who produced a constant stream of genuinely fast deliveries.  He is still very slim and hell fill out over the next couple of years, but his understanding of the game at 18 is something to be in awe of. His movement in the field, his line and length, his knowledge of when to bowl yorkers and such. Im very impressed. Chris Gayle and Wavell Hinds made a sensible start, choosing their shots well against Chaminda Vaas and Dharshana Gamage. Sri Lanka made a breakthrough when Hinds was caught at mid-on as he tried to lift Vaas. Lara hoisted Kumar Dharmasena for six, but was caught at cover on the next ball. Gayle continued to deal tentatively with the moderate turn and was bowled for 21 when he misread Upul Chandana. Man of the Match and Man of the Series Samuels gave the West Indies innings a welcome injection of aggression. He hit Chandana for 14 runs in the 25th over, with one of his two sixes soaring out of the stadium.  Samuels and Sarwan were looking confident when the first of two rain interruptions occurred with the West Indies on 122 for three after 28 overs. Sarwan was dismissed soon after play resumed with a revised target of 186 of 64 off 120 balls. The right-hander mistimed his sweep off Muttiah Muralidharan and was caught at slip. Earlier, Sri Lanka had struggled against a focussed West Indies attack after Lara won the toss. Taylor took the vital scalp of Maravan Atapattu when the Sri Lankan skipper was caught by Hurley to leave the tourists struggling at 64 for four.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

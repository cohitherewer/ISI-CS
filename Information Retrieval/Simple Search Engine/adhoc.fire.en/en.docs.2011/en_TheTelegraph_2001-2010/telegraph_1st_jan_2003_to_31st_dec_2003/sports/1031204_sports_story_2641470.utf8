The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India A open vs Sri Lanka A
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: India will start their tri-series for A teams campaign in the city against Sri Lanka on December 22. The tri-series, originally scheduled from December 14-21, has now been postponed by eight days. The final will be played on December 30. India will play against Pakistan, the third team of the tournament, on December 25 and 28, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said. It should be an event of interest for the city cricket fans, as the second-string (not necessarily short on star value) players of the three powers of international cricket will fight it out among themselves and also attempt to impress the respective national selectors. Pakistan, led by Shahid Afridi, will offer a lot of international flavour in the likes of Umar Gul, Mohammed Hafeez, Faisal Iqbal, Imran Nazir and Junaid Zia.

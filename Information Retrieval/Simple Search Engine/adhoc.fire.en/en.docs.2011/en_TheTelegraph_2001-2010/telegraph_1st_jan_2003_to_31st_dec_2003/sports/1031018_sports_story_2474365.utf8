				 																																	London: Arsenal star Robert Pires has revealed that he snubbed the chance of a summer move to Chelsea. The French international midfielder was approached during the Confederations Cup in May but opted instead to sign a new three-year deal at Arsenal, who host their wealthy London rivals at Highbury on Saturday. They wanted to sign me, but I preferred to stay at Arsenal, Pires told Fridays edition of the London Evening Standard. 				 																																	It was an easy decision to make because I love playing for Arsenal. I always wanted to stay at the club.				 																																	With the number of quality players who have come to the club, Chelsea have made it clear how much they want to win the championship, Pires said. However, you also have big players who are used to being first choice and everyone wants to play. That is normal. For the moment everything is going well. But the problems may come when Chelsea lose a game, when they suffer a defeat.				 																																	Paris: Sochaux midfielder Wilson Oruma has been banned for one month by the French football federation for pushing the referee at the end of a Ligue 1 match. Sochaux were incensed when they were denied an injury-time penalty against visitors Paris St Germain, who won the October 4 game 1-0.				 																																	Even if its true that I pushed him, it wasnt a violent gesture, the Nigerian said after the punishment was announced on Thursday evening. They had warned me I could get six months.				 																																	Oruma will be able to play for Sochaux in the second round of the Uefa Cup				 																																	Phillip Island: Spains newly-crowned 125cc world champion Daniel Pedrosa broke both ankles in a spectacular ending to his season at the Australian Grand Prix on Friday.				 																																	The teenager lost control of his Honda bike during a morning practice session at the Phillip Island circuit and slid into a wall of tyres, taking the full impact with his feet.				 																																	Pedrosa was immediately taken to the Cowes hospital near the track for X-rays of his feet. 				 																																	Pedrosas parents and younger brother had arrived in Australia on Thursday to celebrate his world title.				 																																	Abuja: Violent scenes at Abuja stadium after Nigeria lost 2-0 to Cameroon in the All African Games soccer final could result in Fifa sanctions, officials said on Friday.				 																																	Fans threw plastic bottles on to the pitch and made rude gestures at Cameroon players as they went up to collect their gold medals on Thursday. The Cameroonians later needed shielding by heavily armed riot police to reach their team bus.

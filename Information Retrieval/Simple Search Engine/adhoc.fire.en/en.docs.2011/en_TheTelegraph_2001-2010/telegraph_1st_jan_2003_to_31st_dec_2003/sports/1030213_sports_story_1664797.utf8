The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mental toughness alone separates No. 1 from No. 2
Indians should focus on themselves, feels Sandy Gordon FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI STEVE: Toughest cricketer I have known Paarl: Sandy Gordon didnt have to, but he made it a point to wish the Indian cricketers as they left the team hotel for the BoE Park here, Wednesday morning. It was a nice gesture and showed Gordon is more than just a hot-shot sport psychologist.Gordon, who is returning to Perth after making presentations at a couple of seminars and sessions with the Indians, is always hard pressed for time. He did, however, speak to The Telegraph late Tuesday.The following are excerptsOn his backgroundI started off as a physical education teacher in Glasgow and even played part-time soccer... I then did a diploma course at Aberdeen University and moved to Canada, where I completed a Masters degree in sport psychology at the University of Alberta. I did my doctorate there itself. (Adds laughing) As you can see, I was a slow learner.On sport psychologyIts the study of human behaviour in a certain environment... It takes into account the motivation to participate in a sport and the consequences of such participation. Why does one participate? What happens thereafter? Questions are sought to be answered. Essentially, sport psychology is about enhancing performance, helping sportspersons grow.On his approachI try to inject some fun into sport, try to make the environment more enjoyable. As Ive already told you, I keep telling everybody they should take their jobs seriously, yes, but shouldnt take themselves seriously.On sessions with the Indian squadIve designed game plans that are realistic and challenging... Ive talked about them and the manner of executing those game plans. Its not that Ive prepared a blueprint, in fact, Ive involved the players and asked them to list their targets. Sport isnt about winning, its more about getting the process right. Once thats done, the results will fall into place. (After a pause) You need to have faith, patience and discipline.On what needs to be done by Sourav Ganguly and Co.They should focus on themselves, not so much on the opposition. An individual in control is better equipped to deliver... How tough are the Indians? I wouldnt like to be hasty in my judgement.On his association with Australian cricketIve been with Western Australia from 1987 and, from 1998-2001, was also contracted to the Australian Cricket Board (ACB)... Even now, Im occasionally asked by the ACB to work on some projects.On being part of Steve Waughs Support Team during Australias successful World Cup campaign in 1999Four factors helped Australia: Coach Geoff Marshs wonderful approach of not looking at the negatives, which facilitated a positive culture; the high level of mental motivation and embracing that No Regrets Tour theme; the quality of leadership from both the captain and vice-captain (Shane Warne) and the Australians stubborn, never willing to give up approach. Their bloody-mindedness...On the No Regrets Tour theme(Laughs) It was coined by Steve himself... Basically, there was the possibility that some in the squad wouldnt again get to play in a World Cup and, so, Steve felt nobody should end the tournament with regrets. The theme did wonders  Australia just kept winning after a lopsided start. Ive advised the Indians too to decide on a theme.On Steve (Waugh)Mentally, probably the toughest cricketer Ive interacted with... Great motivator and an exceptional leader.On the cricketer he admires mostAdam Gilchrist. Hes got great attitude, possesses superb skills and aims to be a winner. I regard him as a perfect role-model.On whether he has worked with non-cricketersYes, Ive been associated with golfers (through the PGA) and quite a few soccer players. The basics, after all, remain the same.Finally, on the difference a sport psychologist can makeLet me answer it this way  assuming that all other things (talent, fitness, resources) are the same, its mental toughness alone which will separate a No.1 from the No.2, a gold medallist from the silver medallist... Since youve asked me, a sport  Copyright

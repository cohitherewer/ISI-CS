 Surya Sekhar rolls on
 Sandipan shares 2nd spot with Humpy Kozhikode, Dec. 13 (PTI): GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly recorded his fourth victory on the trot, against M.R. Venkatesh, in the 14th round of the National A chess championship on Saturday. With nine rounds remaining in the marathon tournament, Surya moved to 11 points out of a possible 14 and is 1.5 points clear of nearest rivals GMs Koneru Humpy and Sandipan Chanda. In joint fourth position are GM Abhijit Kunte and top seed GM P. Harikrishna, who has fought his way back in the championship, on nine points. Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury and Neelotpal Das share the sixth spot with 8.5 points each. GM Dibyendu Barua and Tejas Bakre are on eight. Surya recorded his swiftest win of the meet, outplaying Venkatesh with his well-disguised tactical manoeuvres. Playing white, Surya opted for a king-pawn opening and reached a comfortable position against Venkateshs Classical Sicilian. He was too good in the end game. Sandipan was let off the hook by S. Satyapragyan from a seemingly winning position arising out of a Sicilian Defence where the former played white. Satyapragyan squandered an easy chance to attack his opponents king and then offered a draw which was immediately accepted by Sandipan. Humpy won a game of fluctuating fortunes against Suvrajit Saha. Gaining huge positional advantage after some reckless play by Suvrajit, Humpy failed to cash in on it initially. Both players came under time pressure, and despite fighting well at this stage, Suvrajit committed another fatal error. Neelotpal did well to hold Kunte, while Harikrishna had little difficulty in outclassing V. Hariharan. Saptarshi drew with Dibyendu, while Arghyadip Das (5.5) beat Sriram Jha. Roktim Bandopadhyay (8.5) drew with Tejas Bakre.  Copyright

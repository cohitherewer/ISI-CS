The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bonus point confusion
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Dec. 27: Pakistan kept their chances of making the Kenstar Asian A championship final alive with a convincing 48-run victory against Sri Lanka A at Eden Gardens on Saturday. Sri Lanka, who started with two convincing victories in the tournament, suffered their second consecutive defeat. Their challenge faded away in the face of an inspired allround display by Pakistan who now have to beat India tomorrow and earn a bonus point to make the title-round. There was drama over the calculation of the bonus point. The teams were kept in the dark till late in the evening and a decision was arrived upon  Lanka getting one point  after hectic consultations with ICC umpires manager Chris Kaley. Match Referee Gundappa Viswanaths media release later said: The rule specifies that bonus point could be given to a team that achieves victory with a run rate 1.25 times that of the opposition. Comparing the scores it was observed that Pakistan scored at a rate of 1.244 times than Sri Lanka. Therefore, Pakistan could not be awarded a bonus point for the match. On the other hand, the playing conditions specify that if a team loses without conceding the bonus point to the winning team, it would get one point. For the match in question Pakistan has been awarded five points for a win without earning the bonus and Sri Lanka have been awarded one for a loss but not conceding the bonus point. Initially, chasing 245 on a pitch where runs were scored at will till the other day did not appear to be a problem for the Lankans. However, the middle-order succumbed to the pressure once a few wickets fell in quick succession. Naveed Nawaz top-scored but after Russel Arnold fell to a controversial decision, the Lankan challenge ended. Arnold made his displeasure evident after being adjudged leg-before. He felt there was a nick from the bat onto the pad. Three run outs also contributed to the Lankan downfall. Lanka had wished to make full use of the overcast conditions once they put Pakistan into bat in the morning. However, it was off-spinner Saman Jayantha who impressed most with his line and length. Shahid Afridi, who came down the order, survived a mere two balls and was foxed by one that turned from Herath. The Pakistan skippers dismissal had reduced them to 113 for four but Faisal Iqbal and Naveed Latif added 85 off 67 balls for the fifth wicket. MoM Latif hit 50 off 39 balls (4x4, 2x6).  Copyright

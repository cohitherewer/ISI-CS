The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Monday, February 24, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	London: Joe Hussain, father of England captain Nasser Hussain has asked his son not to give up captaincy in a huff.				 																																	I told him not to do anything, because I thought he might just pack it in, Joe said in an interview published in The Observer Sunday.				 																																	Joe said he had a telephonic conversation with Nasser soon after the press conference in South Africa where Nasser said he would definitely consider relinquishing the England captaincy after the World Cup.				 																																	But Joe said he would advice his son otherwise. Id ask him to continue  because he has done nothing wrong. Apart from the hammering we got from Australia, he has done a fantastic job. Hussain led his team to an emphatic 112-run victory against Pakistan in a World Cup match at Cape Town Saturday.				 																																	Joe Hussain has expended a lot of emotional energy on Nassers playing career. If anything, he is even more nervous than his son when he starts a Test innings. When he goes out to bat I go outside the ground. I go for a walk somewhere and have a smoke. If he reaches 20 or 25, I come back in and start watching, he said. 				 																																	Sydney: Zimbabwes batting mainstay Andy Flower has said he may play cricket in Australia after he was asked by his cricket board to give up his black armband protest or face being axed from the World Cup squad.				 																																	Flower said he had kept his options open and was close to signing a deal with an Australian state team.				 																																	Id love to come and play cricket in the domestic competition in Australia, Flower was quoted as saying in The Sun Herald.				 																																	Flower and Olonga wore black armbands and then black wristbands in Zimbabwes matches against Namibia and India besides issuing a scathing statement mourning the death of democracy in their country under the regime of Robert Mugabe.				 																																	Obviously, things are a bit difficult here at the moment and Id enjoy having a playing stint there and having temporary residence there, Flower said. Ive had some discussions and to be honest it is something Id like to do. Flower did not say whether he would continue with the protest now that he knew the implication of his action.				 																																	Bloemfontein: South Africas World Cup squad went their separate ways on Sunday as all 15 players began a two-day break from the pressure-cooker environment of the tournament.				 																																	South Africa beat Bangladesh by 10 wickets in Bloemfontein on Saturday to keep their hopes of qualifying for the Super Sixes alive, but the hosts have clearly struggled to deal with the enormous weight of expectation on them.				 																																	The break from the tournament was agreed before results started going against the hosts with defeats by West Indies and New Zealand.				 																																	We believe that it is important to send the guys back to their families whenever there is an opportunity, South Africa manager Goolam Raja had said before the tournament.				 																																	Nairobi: Sri Lankas star spinner Muttiah Muralidharan goes into Mondays World Cup clash against Kenya here facing a stern Australian examination of his bowling action.				 																																	Muralidharan will be supervised by Australian official Daryl Harper who is a member of the elite eight-man panel of umpires. Unlike compatriots Darrel Hair and Ross Emerson, Harper has not called Muralidharan for throwing, but the Sri Lankans remain wary of umpires from Down Under.				 																																	n Zimbabwe vs Australia live from 1 pm on SET Max n Sri Lanka vs Kenya live from 12 noon on Sony n India vs Namibia highlights from 9.30 pm on SET Max n Follow Through from 7 am on STAR Sports

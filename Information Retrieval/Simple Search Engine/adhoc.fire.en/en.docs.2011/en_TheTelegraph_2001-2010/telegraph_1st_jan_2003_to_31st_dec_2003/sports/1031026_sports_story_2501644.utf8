 Judit beats Anand
 Heartbreak for Anand after beating Leko Cap DAgde (France), Oct. 25 (PTI): Viswanathan Anand had a mixed second day in the World Rapid Chess Championship beating Peter Leko but then going down to Judit Polgar (both Hungary) on Saturday. Anand is now placed fourth in a field of eight in Group B with just three more games remaining in the league phase. Top four players will qualify for the quarter final. Peter Svidler of Russia was joined by Judit in the lead in on three points. With two draws against Frenchman Joel Lautier and Russian teammate Alexander Grischuk, Svidler looks certain for the knockout berth. Grischuk is third on 2.5 while Anand (1.5) is a close fourth. In Group A, top seed Vladimir Kramnik of Russia has half-a-point lead over Etienne Bacrot of France, Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine and Bulgarian Veselin Topalov. Anand was at his attacking best right from the start against Leko, who fell prey to some fine moves that cost him his queen. It did not take Anand too long to wrap the issue, precisely 45 moves.  But against Judit, Anand opened with the English attack against the Sicilian Nazdorf and was subjected to an allround attack against his own king. Judit kept the pressure going and won in 39 moves. Earlier, Anand had drawn against Russias Alexander Grischuk and Spaniard Alexei Shirov on Day I.  Copyright

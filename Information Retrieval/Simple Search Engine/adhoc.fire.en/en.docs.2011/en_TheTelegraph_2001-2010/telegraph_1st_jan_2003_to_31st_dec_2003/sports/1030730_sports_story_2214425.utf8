 Indian trio shares second position
 Harikrishna got the better of Daniel Gormally Edinburgh: Grandmaster Abhijit Kunte scored a fine victory over local favourite Jonathan Rowson to move into joint second after the seventh round of the British Chess Championship on Tuesday. GM Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh put it across local star Paul Motwani and regained sole lead on six points. GM Peter Wells of England and the Indian trio of Kunte, P. Harikrishna and S. Vijayalakshmi are half a point adrift the leader. Harikrishna gave an endgame lesson to Daniel Gormally of England while double GM norm holder Tejas Bakre accounted for another Englishman Stuart Conquest. Vijayalakshmi was also in full swing, getting the better of Surya Sekhar Ganguly (4.5). Dibyendu Barua (3) suffered his third loss of the tournament, going down to Simon Buckley. Swati Ghate assured herself of the WGM norm drawing with International Master Sunderrajan Kidambi. National womens champion Aarthie Ramaswamy went down to David Eggleston of England while Nisha Mohota and Eesha Karavade met with similar fate against Englishmen Jack Rudd and Peter Sowray. S. Meenakshi (3.5) warded off the challenge of Kenneth McEwan of Scotland. Abhijit clinched the game in the 35th move.  (PTI)  Copyright

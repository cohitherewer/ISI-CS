The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ get down to business after 8 days
			Kimberley: New Zealand resume their World Cup campaign on Wednesday against Bangladesh after enduring an embarrassing break from action that involved a brawl in a night club. Eight days after defeating the powerful South Africa in Johannesburg, Stephen Flemings men get down to business in a mad scramble to make the Super Sixes from group B. Kenyas shock win over Sri Lanka on Monday further complicated the race, leaving New Zealand in a must-win situation against both Bangladesh and Canada to stay in contention. This is a very important game, Fleming said. The long break has been good for us but we are leaving nothing to chance because we need to improve our run-rate besides putting four more points on the board. The Black Caps are likely to rest opening batsman Nathan Astle. Astle is struggling with a knee injury that has plagued him for almost a year and a hernia problem he picked up in the teams win over West Indies earlier in the tournament. An incident in a Durban night club last week left Chris Cairns with cuts and bruises on his face.Cairns is expected to be fit to play and Fleming insisted his team had got over the incident. TEAMS New Zealand (from): Stephen Fleming, Nathan Astle, Scott Styris, Chris Cairns, Chris Harris, Brendon McCullum, Andre Adams, Daniel Vettori, Jacob Oram, Shane Bond, Craig McMillan, Kyle Mills, Daryl Tuffey, Mathew Sinclair.

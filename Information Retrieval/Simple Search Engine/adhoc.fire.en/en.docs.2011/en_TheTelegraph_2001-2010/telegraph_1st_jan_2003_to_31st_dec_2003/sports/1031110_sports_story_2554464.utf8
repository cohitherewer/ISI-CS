The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deportivo move atop 
Madrid: Defender Igor Jauregi scored two own-goals as Deportivo de la Coruna fought back to defeat Real Sociedad 2-1 and move to the top of the Spanish league. Deportivos victory was its first in three league matches and helped it recover from its 3-8 thrashing by Monaco Wednesday in the Champions League. In Saturdays other games, midfielder Andoni Iraola netted his first league goal as Athletic de Bilbao edged last-place Espanyol 1-0 to go fifth in the standings, while Zaragoza drew 1-1 with Celta de Vigo. Deportivo have 25 points from 11 games, while Valencia are second with 23, above Real Madrid on goal difference. Osasuna are fourth with 17 points, ahead of Bilbao on goal difference. Jauregi came to Deportivos rescue with two own-goals in a 15-minute spell late in the second half as Deportivo bounced back from their humiliating loss in what was a Champions League record scoreline. Deportivos players were given a warm reception as they took the field at the Riazor Stadium but gave a lifeless first-half display. Striker Nihat Kahveci put Sociedad in front in the 29th minute with a low shot from the edge of the area. The goal was the Turkish internationals third of the season. In a bid to galvanise his team, Deportivo coach Javier Irureta replaced ineffectual Spanish international Juan Carlos Valeron with temperamental midfielder Djalminha, who had not made a league appearance since the 2001-2002 season. Djalminha, whose six-year career at Deportivo has been spattered with controversy, spent last season at Austria Vienna. The substitution worked and Jauregi made his first unfortunate contribution by deflecting a low cross by left back Joan Capdevila into his own goal. With three minutes remaining, Jauregi again came to Deportivos aid when Djalminhas corner hit his shoulder and beat goalkeeper Sander Westerveld.  (AP)  Copyright

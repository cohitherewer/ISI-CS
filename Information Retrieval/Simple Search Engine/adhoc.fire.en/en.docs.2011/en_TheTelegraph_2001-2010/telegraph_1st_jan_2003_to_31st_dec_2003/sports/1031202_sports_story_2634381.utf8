 Reid cannot do miracles: Hadlee
 Hadlee feels Aussies must be made to toil Mumbai: New Zealand great Richard Hadlee on Monday said the Indian team, which has roped in Bruce Reid as its bowling coach for the four-match Test series against Australia, should not expect miracles from the former left-arm seamer. Reid cannot do miracles with the Indian team which does not have a very good bowling strength. He can only work with whatever talent is available at his disposal, said Hadlee, who was here for the launch of the Academy for Cricketing Excellence (ACE) awards, in which he is a panel member. Terming Indias tour Down Under as a real tough one, Hadlee said, the only way the visitors can beat the Aussies during their Test series is by slowing down the Australian run rate and then improving upon it. The Australians try to score 350 to 400 runs per day so that by the third day of the Test they are ready for the killer punch. So the important thing for the Indians is to slow them down and make them earn every run, he said. Indias batting line-up is pretty good. So when batting, they should try to score runs quickly to get the psychological advantage over the Aussies, he added. The Indians should think positively as the Aussies will make things tough and if the Indians fail to take up the challenge then they will be beaten.  (PTI)  Copyright

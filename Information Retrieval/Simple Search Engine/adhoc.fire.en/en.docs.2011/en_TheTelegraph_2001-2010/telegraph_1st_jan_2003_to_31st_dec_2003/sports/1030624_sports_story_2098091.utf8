The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Not ashamed of loss: Latif
- We showed great character against a quality side, says Vaughan  Marcus Trescothick (seen celebrating with Chris Read) scored an unbeaten 108 and hit a six to help England scrape home against Pakistan at Lords, sealing the series 2-1. (Reuters) London: Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said his side had played better cricket than England despite losing by four wickets in the third and final ODI at Lords on Sunday.The result saw England complete a come-from-behind 2-1 series win in a match where Pakistan had no luck at all.Fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Sami repeatedly beat the bat and marginal umpiring decisions went against them. But had they not dropped England opener Marcus Trescothick on his way to a match-winning unbeaten 108, as well as missing two chances to run out the Somerset left-hander, it might have been a different story.Pakistan played extremely well. Im not ashamed of the loss, said wicketkeeper Latif who dropped Trescothick on 93.It went their (Englands) way today although they also played well. But I personally feel Pakistan played better cricket than England.I always believed we were going to win this game. But I dropped a catch at a crucial moment and that is all part and parcel of the game, Latif added. However, he was happy with the progress his new-look team were making. It is very difficult to lose a group of eight world-class players after the World Cup debacle. But the way they have played all three meets since (Pakistan won in Sharjah and lost in the final in Sri Lanka before coming to England) is encouraging.Trescothick was elated at making a hundred in a winning cause for England against Pakistan, having made 137 at Lords when England lost to them by two runs in a tri-series match two years ago. Its always very tough when youre facing two 100mph bowlers, explained Trescothick after battling Shoaib and Sami. But the best feeling was to be there at the end, added Trescothick. For Michael Vaughan this win meant victory in his first series as Englands one-day captain since succeeding Nasser Hussain. To come back from 0-1 down against a side of this quality shows immense character, said Vaughan.  Copyright

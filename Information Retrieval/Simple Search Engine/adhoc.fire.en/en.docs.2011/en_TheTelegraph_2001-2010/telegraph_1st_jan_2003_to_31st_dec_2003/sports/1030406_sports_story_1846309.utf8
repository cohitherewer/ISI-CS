The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Season ends on controversial note 
 BY STAR RACER  CALCUTTA RACING  Chisty Calcutta, April 5: The RCTC stewards harsh decision of disqualifing Royal Contender, the winner of the BSF Trophy, Div. I, notwistanding, it was smooth sailing in rest of the race-card today as the came down to the 27-Day RCTC season. It was a foregone conclusion that the Sanjeev Charan-trainee would lose the race in the stewards room on account of causing a severe intereference to the favourite Actable in the last furlong of the race. However, little did one relise that the August body would come down so heavily on jockey Imran Chisty for such a routine offence. Stewards felt Chistys handling of the horse amounted to dangerous riding as the jockey never tried to put his horse on an even keel even after knocking Actable out of his stride, said Rajan Mehrotra, RCTC general manager, racing. Seasons toppers Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh, jockey Cristopher Alford, apprentice Rutherford Alford and owner Deepak Khaitan and his Soom Stud Farm retained their championship records straight as they once again, headed their respective categories.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Olonga goes into hiding
 - Seven plainclothes officers from  Zimbabwes secret police arrived in East London on Friday to escort him home where a likely charge of treason awaited Olonga: Looking  to start a new life in Kenya or England  London: Zimbabwe pace bowler  Henry Olongas international career came to an end last  night in dramatic circumstances with a secret journey to  a safe house somewhere in South Africa. He will hide until he is able  to start a new life in a different country  maybe in Kenya  where he was born and where he has family still, or England,  where he could take advantage of asylum. Olongas last few hours as an  international cricketer were spent nervously looking over  his shoulder, lest there was a tap on his shoulder that  could have threatened his life. Seven plainclothes officers from  Zimbabwes secret police, believed to be from the central  intelligence organisation, arrived in East London on Friday  and were entertained by World Cup organisers during Zimbabwes  74-run defeat by Sri Lanka on Saturday. Their real purpose for being in  the sleepy, coastal town was more sinister than watching  their countrys emotionally ravaged cricket team bow out  of the World Cup, a report in The Sunday Telegraph said.  Olonga has received numerous threats  during the last month but this one was different. He had  been told the officers intended to escort him home where  a likely charge of treason awaited.  The punishment for treason in  Zimbabwe is death. The drama began in mid-afternoon  when officers from the World Cup-appointed close protection  unit came to the players hotel and packed all of Olongas  personal possession in case he was intercepted after the  match.  Olonga appeared on the field to  perform 12th man duties early in the afternoon to create  the impression that everything was proceeding as normal.  But things were far from normal despite Olongas impossibly  courageous attempts to stay calm. He was pretty shaken but he seemed  to be coping as well as anyone can in a situation like that,  said a teammate after the match.  Olonga along with Andy Flower  wore black armbands in their opening match of the tournament  and issued a joint statement mourning the death of democracy  in Zimbabwe, a gesture that earned world-wide praise and  also the wrath of the political regime in Zimbabwe. Andy Flower too quit international  cricket on Saturday, a step widely believed to have been  taken due to the fall-out of his protest. (PTI) Copyright

 WI restrict Lanka to 201 
Bridgetown, June 7 (Reuters): The West Indies dismissed Sri Lanka for 201 in the first of three one-day Internationals on Saturday, with pace bowler Mervyn Dillon posting figures of three for 38. Sri Lanka struggled to cope with the West Indies pace attack, with Romesh Kaluwitharanas plucky 54 the best resistance the tourists could muster in 48.4 overs at the crease. West Indies skipper Brian Lara won the toss and asked Sri Lanka to bat, taking advantage of some early moisture in the Queens Park Oval wicket. His decision was vindicated when Sanath Jayasuriya edged Dillons third ball to keeper Ridley Jacobs. Kaluwitharana waged a gritty war with Dillon and fellow paceman Corey Collymore.  Copyright

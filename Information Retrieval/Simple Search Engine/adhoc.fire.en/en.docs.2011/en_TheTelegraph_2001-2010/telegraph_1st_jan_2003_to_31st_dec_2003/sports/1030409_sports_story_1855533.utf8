 King turns down WI coaching job
 King: Keen to remain in Australia Sydney: Australian Bennett King will continue in his role as Australian Cricket Academy head coach and not take up an offer to coach the West Indies cricket team, the Australian Cricket Board said on Tuesday. King was keen to continue as academy coach in Adelaide and had advised the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the ACB of his decision, the ACB said in a statement. He was keen to remain involved with Australian player development, planned to continue his contract with the Cricket Academy and had advised the WICB and the ACB of his thinking this week, the ACB said. The West Indies coaching position becomes available on July 1 and King notified the ACB that he had spoken to the WICB about the position. King is highly regarded in Australia, having guided Queensland to three consecutive Sheffield Shield titles from the 1999-2000 season after succeeding John Buchanan when he took over the Australian team. He discussed the job offer with his family before reaching his decision. King works in Adelaide with the academy but his wife and three schooling children live in Brisbane. King was angered and embarrassed last week when the WICB announced that the job was his and the media had been informed. He said that no official appointment offer had been made and no terms and conditions had been agreed with him. He said last Tuesday that the WICB had subsequently apologised for prematurely announcing his appointment.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arup aims to be in top 6
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, May 17: The lone badminton player from the state to have made some sort of impact at the national level in recent times, Arup Baidya is fighting to break into the top six at the moment. The 24-year-old has represented the country in some international tournaments abroad, but is yet to seal a place in the national team. In order to do that, I have to make it to the top six at least. Thats my aim, said Baidya Saturday. I lost to Sachin Ratti in the quarter finals at the nationals this year after beating No. 6 Thomas Kurien, said Baidya. As of now, I want to take it step by step and reaching the semi-finals in the next nationals is my priority. Bengal have not produced a senior national champion since 1969, when Dipu Ghosh wrested the crown. Baidya feels lack of training partners and wooden courts are hindering his progress. We have a good court at Khudiram Anushilan Kendra, which is often used for non-sport purposes. It is affecting all players in the state. Baidya is among the handful of Indian players whose kits are sponsored by Yonex. Baidya is looking forward to the inter-Railway meet to be held in Guwahati late June. If I do well there, I will be picked for the Railway team, which will enable me to attend the camp to be conducted by Madhumita Bisht. That will come in handy.  Copyright

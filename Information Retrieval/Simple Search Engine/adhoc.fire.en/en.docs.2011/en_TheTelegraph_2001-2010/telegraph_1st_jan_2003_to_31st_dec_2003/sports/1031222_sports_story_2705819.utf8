The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sasikiran absence wasnt a factor
 - New national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly rates latest triumph close to his finest moment  BY ATREYO MUKHOPADHYAY  Surya Sekhar Ganguly at home with the National A trophy on Sunday. Picture by Aranya Sen Calcutta: Having burst onto the national chess map with the promise of being a precious talent years ago, Surya Sekhar Ganguly has lived up to the billing. Finishing third in the Asian mens championship in 2001, confirming the Grandmaster title last year  all these before completing 20  dont happen to Indian players very often. On Saturday, Surya took a major step towards establishing himself as the third force in Indian chess after Viswanathan Anand and Krishnan Sasikiran by winning the National A title in Kozhikode. Yes, Sasikiran wasnt there and Anand doesnt take part in the meet these days, but this find of The Telegraph Schools meet doesnt think that should take away any credit from his achievement. Talking to The Telegraph on Sunday, Surya explained what makes the victory special. The following are excerpts Q Does the absence of Sasikiran take something away from your victory in Kozhikode? A Not really. His presence would have meant that I had to cope with a stronger player in one game out of the 23 one had to play in this edition of the meet. I was the second seed and for the first time in four years in National A, I felt I had a genuine chance to win the title. I had a very satisfying outing as far as the quality of games were concerned. Sasikiran would mean just one tough game, I played very well in all of them. You came third in the Asian individual meet, recently excelled at the world championship qualifiers in Dhaka and now the National A title. Which one do you pick as the best? Not an easy choice. I think above all is the GM title. It was the result of years of perseverance. That stays above the rest. After that, I must admit that in Dhaka I was under extreme pressure since just one qualifying spot for the world meet was available. It was a strong field and I scored 9.5 in 11 rounds. This National A performance is close to that since it was a 23-round event  rarely do we come across such a long tournament. Even then, I was consistent and am pleased with the way I played. So this will also be special. How different was your approach this time from the last three attempts at the National A and when did you sense you had a real chance? I was quite confident that I could win the title. Earlier, staying in the top six (which ensures a berth in the Indian team for Chess Olympiad) used to be my priority. I concentrated on winning with white and drawing with black (he won four of the 11 games with black and drew seven, while winning nine of the 12 games with white apart from a loss and two draws). My closest rivals, Sandipan Chanda and P. Harikrishna, didnt start well. So I didnt bother about winning with black in the first half. Once they started winning, I changed my ploy and went for the kill with black pieces. It paid off and after beating Dibyendu Barua in the ninth round, I started sniffing victory. Your progress in the Elo rating list has been steadiest among Indians after a dull period in 2000-01. Where do you go from here? I have managed to stay above 2500 after cracking it. I will gain more after Dhaka and Kozhikode. Reaching 2600 as early as possible is the next goal. I think staying above 2500 was the trick. Many others have come down after reaching that mark. As for the slump, it was caused by financial constraints and once I joined Indian Oil in late 2000, things improved a lot. What has been the influence of Anand on you? I have been in touch quite regularly of late. Even during the National A meet I have exchanged notes with him over e-mail, which have been immensely helpful. He in fact tried to use one of my suggestions against Peter Svidler recently. We have begun to interact more and needless to say that I have been the one to benefit.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 County makes you a hard person, says Yuvraj
Bangalore: Yuvraj Singh Monday dismissed his unimpressive show in his debut county season as one of those bad batting phases and insisted that his stint with Yorkshire had been a good experience. It was a good experience although I did not do well in the last two months. Its ups and downs for me. The first month was good and then I struggled a bit, he said as the second phase of the Indian preparatory camp got underway. County cricket makes you a hard person, he said. While playing five-day-a-week had been hectic, the left-hander said he could not do anything about it as it is how county cricket is played. I was doing my best. I had a bad phase in the last month. It happens sometime. My effort was there all the time. They (the county side) are happy with me, Yuvraj said. Yuvraj said though he was not under pressure he knew as a professional he was expected to perform well. But I learnt a lot of things by playing with players from different countries. I also started cooking by myself which is a good thing, he said in a lighter vein. Yuvraj, who is trying to be more consistent in one-day cricket, said the upcoming series against New Zealand would be interesting. He was also keen to do well in the Challenger series and other scheduled games preceding the two-Test series.  (PTI)  Copyright

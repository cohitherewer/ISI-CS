The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Arjun Singh in lead
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Arjun Singh shot a superb round of six-under 66 to displace the overnight leaders in the penultimate round of the Hero Honda South India Open, the fourth leg of the Indian Golf Tour over the Karnataka Golf Association course Thursday. The Delhi pros three-day total read seven-under 209, three strokes ahead of second placed Digvijay Singh who submitted a card of three-under 69 Thursday. Gaurav Ghei returned a card of two-under 70 to register a total of 213 for 54 holes to be the third spot while Champion Golfer of the Year Mukesh Kumar was fourth with a stroke behind. S. Madaiah who became a hero overnight by sharing the lead on the second day, shot a round of one-over par and was in the fifth position. Ajay Gupta and Ashok Kumar were tied for the sixth position while the other overnight leaders  Shiv Prakash and Vijay Kumar were sharing the eighth spot. My putting has been good since the first day where three-putted on three holes, said Arjun who had 26 putts for the day. It is real test here. With the course playing tough, it is easy to make a bogey than a birdie. A bunch of players are breathing down my neck. I am taking the final round as just another round, said the current Order of Merit list leader.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Almond set to strike 
  FROM WILLIAM TELL  R. Shanker K. Appu Mysore: Almond who had let down a host of supporters on the opening day of the season here, being surprised by rank outsider Almost Heaven, is expected to make amends Wednesday. He takes on eight rivals in the 1,200m F. B. Sharma Memorial Gold Trophy, the main event in that race-card.Going by his recent track trials, the Be Fresh-Blue Chiffon gelding from trainer Ravi Shankers yard, gives the impression that he has improved considerably since his last outing. Moreover, with K. P. Appu to partner, he may easily ward off the expected challenges from Frontier Hero and Heroic. In their opening day encounter, both horses had placed nearly four lengths behind Almond.SELECTIONS2.30 pm: Diamond 1. No Criticism 2. Little Brave 3.3 pm: Jaihindh 1. Solar Spirit 2.

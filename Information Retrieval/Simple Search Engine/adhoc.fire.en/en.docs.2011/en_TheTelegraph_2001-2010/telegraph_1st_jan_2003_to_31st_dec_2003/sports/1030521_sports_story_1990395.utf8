The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Subrata new Tollygunge coach
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Dumped unceremoniously by a club he guided to the National League peak last season, Subrata Bhattacharya got a new assignment Tuesday which may not be as glamorous as the last one but far more challenging. Tollygunge Agragami finalised a deal with Subrata whereby he will coach the NFL team for the entire season. Tollygunge were on the lookout for a coach after they lost Aloke Mukherjee to Mohun Bagan recently. I had fruitful talks and am looking forward to working with the Tollygunge team, Subrata said late Tuesday evening after a long session with a senior club official. But there are a couple of things still to be thrashed out before which I wouldnt like to comment on my new assignment. Subrata had also been approached by Bangladeshi club Mukti Yodha Sansad to be their coach for the season. He, however, is satisfied with the players Tollygunge have signed up so far but has asked for a couple of specific recruits. We will try and rope in the players Subrata wants, a senior club official said.  Copyright

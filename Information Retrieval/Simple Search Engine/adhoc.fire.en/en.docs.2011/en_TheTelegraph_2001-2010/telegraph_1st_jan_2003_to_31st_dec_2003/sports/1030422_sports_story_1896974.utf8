 Becks wants to make it big in the US
 NEVER SAY NEVER: David Beckham doesnt rule out a move to Real London: Manchester Uniteds David Beckham says he would love the challenge of making it big in the United States  but does not rule out a move to European champions Real Madrid. Beckham, who has been linked with Real in recent weeks, fuelled further speculation with comments made before the two sides meet in their Champions League quarter final second leg at Old Trafford on Wednesday. Real won the first leg in Spain 3-1. As Ive always said, Never say never, the England captain said in an interview with this weeks European edition of Time magazine. You always want to play with the best team and the best players. In the last eight, nine years weve won most things in England, and the European Cup. Real Madrid have got a massive history about them and theyve got world class players in their team. United have consistently denied receiving an approach and manager Alex Ferguson has laughed off transfer talk. In the interview with Time, Beckham said he appreciated the attitude of Americans towards their sporting heroes and was amazed that soccer was not a major sport there. No other English footballer has every really made it big over there, Beckham said. Id love to be well-known in America. Id love to be recognised over there. The American people are so patriotic about their teams and their sports  more so than anywhere else in the world. I like the way they look up to Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. Im sure they criticise players but not to the extent where theyre putting their own people and their own stars down. Thats whats nice. The American public will have the opportunity to see Beckham up close when United tour the US in July, but the 27-year-old does not believe convincing them to like soccer will to be easy. It will be hard. The American people love basketball, baseball, ice hockey and American football. Football isnt one of their major sports. Im surprised because the facilities over in America are amazing and their womens team does really well. I dont see why in the future it cant change. Just another challenge for me, I think, to try to get noticed over there. Its going to be hard work but it will be nice to see what different countries think of me and my teammates.

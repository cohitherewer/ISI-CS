The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ferrero up, Rubin crashes out
New York: Third seed Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain bounced Czech Jan Vacek from the US Open 6-2, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 here Monday. French Open champion Ferrero fired five aces and dominated from the baseline to beat the qualifier, who had won only once this year on hardcourts. Ferrero reached a second-round match against the winner of a later match between American Brian Baker and Austrias Jurgen Melzer. In womens action, eighth seed Chanda Rubin suffered a 72-minute ordeal, crumbling 4-6, 4-6 in the first round to Venezuelan Maria Vento-Kabchi. The American made 46 unforced errors as she struggled to keep the ball in the Arthur Ashe showcourt on a steamy New York morning. Vento-Kabchi simply kept the ball in court as Rubin all but beat herself. Earlier, Ashley Harkleroad thumped Russian Vera Douchevina 6-4, 6-2 in 65 minutes.  Sampras farewell Pete Sampras always threatened to do it this way, his way, with a minimum of fuss, to let a career that began with a bang but ended with little more than a whisper. Tonight in New York, in almost the same spot where he became the youngest US Open champion ever, the games greatest player ever will call it quits at age 32. There will be a brief ceremony and a sustained roar, emotion crackling back and forth between Sampras and the opening-night crowd like electrical current. And then hell pull the plug on tennis and quietly get on with the rest of his life. Sampras hasnt played a competitive match since beating Andre Agassi to win a record 14th major singles title at last years Open, but make no mistake. Few people loved to play the game more; none ever did it better.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

 Schumacher awaits new car
 Michael Schumacher jumps over a guardrail after he spun out in Sao Paulo Sunday. (Reuters) Leipzig: Five-time Formula One champion Michael Schumacher expects his new Ferrari car to be ready for the San Marino Grand Prix on April 20 in Imola. I think well be using the new car there, Schumacher said Tuesday during a visit to a car show in Leipzig. Weve already won in the old car and now comes the new one, which is even better. There is no reason to worry, Schumacher said. Schumacher has had a disappointing start this year under new rules, which were introduced in part to curb Ferraris dominance. Ferrari cars won 15 of 17 races last season. But Schumacher has failed to make the podium in three races this season. He was fourth in Australia, sixth in Malaysia and spun out Sunday in Brazil in a rain-drenched race. In the past, we always said we make one mistake per season. Now, weve made three in a row. But we have to accept a dry spell, the German said. Schumacher seemed surprised that officials allowed the set-up of side wings to be changed between qualifying and the race in Brazil, in violation of new rules. Its difficult when you suddenly have rules that can be changed at will, Schumacher said. You lose confidence. If this happened because of safety concerns, then teams should have been allowed a second set of rain tyres, he said.  We have two sets of dry tyres but only one set of wet tyres, thats a little confusing. I hope it stops soon. But such decisions are made by gentlemen who dont sit in the car that often, Schumacher said.  (AP)  Copyright

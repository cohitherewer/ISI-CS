 PCB calls for ICC evidence  Karachi: Pakistan is awaiting evidence of match-fixing from the ICC before it decides whether to re-open a World Cup 1999 probe, the PCB chief Lt General Tauqir Zia said on Sunday.If the ICC has solid evidence they should send it to us and if (the charges) are of such a serious level then we would send it to the government or to the judge who did the inquiry for further action, Lt Gen. Zia said.In last months meeting in Johannesburg, the ICC questioned Pakistans report, prepared by Lahore High Court judge Karamat Bhandari.The Bhandari report, released last June, concluded that there was no evidence of match fixing in Pakistans surprise defeats to Bangladesh and India, clearing the Pakistan team of wrongdoing. Pakistan initiated the inquiry after Ali Bacher, a former managing director of South Africas UCB, alleged that the two Pakistani defeats were fixed.Bacher, who said the information was passed to him by former Pakistan captain Majid Khan, never appeared before the Bhandari Commission to substantiate his allegations, despite several requests.The PCB has reportedly consulted its lawyer and will answer the ICCs objections during the Councils annual meeting in London in two months.We think theres some sort of misunderstanding and want to finish it as soon as possible, Lt Gen. Zia said. (AFP)  Copyright

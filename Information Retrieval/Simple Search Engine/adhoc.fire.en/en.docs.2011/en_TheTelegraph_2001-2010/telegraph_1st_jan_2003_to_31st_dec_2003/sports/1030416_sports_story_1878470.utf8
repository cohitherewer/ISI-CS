 Wasim hopes to sign off on high note
London: Wasim Akram has hinted that he could hang up his boots at the end of the upcoming English County season and served notice that he intends to bow out in style. The veteran, who spent 10 years with Lancashire, has returned to County cricket after a five-year absence as one of Hampshires overseas players, filling the vacancy created by Shane Warnes ban for using a banned diuretic. Wasim said that if he does call it a day at the end of the season, he wants to bow out on a high note by helping Hampshire bounce straight back to the first division of the County championship. I did my homework before I came here about the team and Hampshire itself and so far everything is 100 per cent, Wasim said. I think this could be my last season. By September Ill be finishing  hopefully on a high note. Hampshire begin their division two campaign at Worcestershire on Friday and Wasim, who has 414 Test wickets to his name, insisted: I think were a good enough side to do well. Wasim became the first player to take 500 wickets in one- day International cricket during the recent World Cup. But that milestone did not spare him from being axed from the side along with seven other senior players for the sides failure to get beyond the first round.  (AFP)  Copyright

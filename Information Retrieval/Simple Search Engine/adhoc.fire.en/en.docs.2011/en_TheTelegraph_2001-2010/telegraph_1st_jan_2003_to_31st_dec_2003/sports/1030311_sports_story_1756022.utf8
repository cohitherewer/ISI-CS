The Telegraph - Calcutta
 The Greenidge-Haynes pair adjusted  brilliantly: Taylor
 - Former Aussie skipper and opener  chooses his top five innings-launchers FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Mark Taylor Johannesburg: Both as opener  and captain, Mark Taylor will be somewhere at the top in  crickets Hall of Fame. The other day, Taylor (who is on  a TV assignment) spoke to The Telegraph exclusively  about his favourite openers. With 7,525 Test runs (average  of 43-plus, 19 hundreds) and over 3,500 in ODIs, his comments  carry weight. Incidentally, in the World Cup  context, Taylor captained Australia to the 1996 final. The following are excerpts On the qualities he would  look for in an opener The same qualities I would look  for in a good batsman. High on my list is the ability to  read the game and adapt accordingly  either by raising  the tempo or dropping anchor. The Gordon Greenidge-Desmond  Haynes pair comes readily to mind... They adjusted brilliantly...  Then, obviously, the skill factor comes into play, as does  temperament. On the criteria in selecting  his top five Except for Michael Vaughan, Ive  picked contemporaries. I mean, a Sunil Gavaskar and a Barry  Richards have legions of admirers, but I didnt play against  them. Nor, for that matter, did I see them from close quarters.  Also, Ive chosen specialist Test openers. GREENIDGE On his choice (alphabetically): Saeed Anwar: Very explosive, with  the ability to transform a match in just one session. Quite  like Greenidge, I would say... Beautiful to watch, with  excellent wrist-work.  Greenidge: Known more as an attacking  batsman, but could defend with ease as well. Had great shots  and a superb technique.  Haynes: Most believed that being  aggressive only came naturally to Greenidge. Well, nothing  could be more untrue... Haynes could attack at will, take  any bowling apart. Michael Slater: In the Greenidge-mould,  capable of winning you a game in one session... Of course,  he could get out early but, if he got a 20, he would get  the next 80 so fast that exciting options would be placed  before the captain. I enjoyed batting with somebody so explosive...  Will he make a comeback? Given Matthew Hayden and Justin  Langers form, that seems unlikely. Vaughan: Has a terrific future...  I saw lots of him during the recent Ashes series and was  most impressed. He took on Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee, Jason  Gillespie... Something I hadnt seen anybody do in a long,  long time. Surely, Vaughan is there to stay and somebody  who will continue to invite appreciation. VAUGHAN On whether somebody narrowly  missed making his top five Perhaps Graham Gooch... On the immensely successful  Hayden-Langer combination They are different and complement  each other... Hayden is tall and powerful and likes hitting  boundaries... Langer generally prefers playing square of  the wicket... He has improved his cricket and, once he got  Slaters place, announced he didnt want to give it away.  (After a pause) Its significant that Hayden and  Langer are good mates... They inspire each other. On how he approached the  openers job (Grins) I would try and  relax, not think too much about the bowlers... After all,  till you are out there, you never quite know how you will  hit the ball and how well your feet will move... You may  think you are in great form but, after 30 minutes, you could  be on three only. Equally, there may be days when youll  get 20 off the first three-four overs... Opening isnt just  about getting runs when batting well, its about getting  runs when you arent batting well. Finally, his message to  the young ones Watch the Sachin Tendulkars, but  dont copy anybody too much... Understand your own game  and, once you can do that, adapting to varied conditions  will be easy. Copyright

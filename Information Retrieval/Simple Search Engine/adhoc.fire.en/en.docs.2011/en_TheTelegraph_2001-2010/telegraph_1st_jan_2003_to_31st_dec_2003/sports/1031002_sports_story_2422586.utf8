The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Revised D/L system from tomorrow
London: An improved system of adjusting run targets in rain-shortened matches will be introduced at Fridays first one-day International between Pakistan and South Africa in Lahore. The new system has been devised to ensure fairness to both teams in matches where the side batting first sets an exceptionally high total, the ICC said in a statement. Under the existing Duckworth-Lewis (D/L) system, victory targets are revised in rain-affected one-day games. New targets are based on how many overs a side has left to bat and how many wickets have already fallen. This years World Cup final underlined the systems weakness when the side batting first posts a huge total. Australia raced to 359 for two in 50 overs. India, in reply, were bowled out for 234 in 39.2 overs, but had hopes of snatching an unlikely victory when storm clouds gathered over Johannesburg after they had made a bright start. With rain threatening, India, on 145 for 3 after 23 overs, were only four runs behind par, said Frank Duckworth, one of the inventors of the D/L system. Losing no more wickets and scoring 12 in next two overs, followed by a terminal downpour, wouldve given the title to India. Weve always been aware that, when the total set by the team batting first is much greater than average, revised targets and par scores can sometimes seem unrealistic, Duckworth added.

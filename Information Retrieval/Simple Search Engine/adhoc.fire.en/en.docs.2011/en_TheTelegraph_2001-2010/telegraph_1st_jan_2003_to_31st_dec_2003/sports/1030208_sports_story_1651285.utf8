The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB not to take HAL for granted 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Saturdays National Football League clash between East Bengal and HAL at Salt Lake Stadium is a study in contrast. Its between the leaders and the relegation stragglers; between a team going through a dream phase and one hoping against hope to stay in the countrys biggest tournament. East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick has left no stone unturned to make sure the red and golds winning streak does not screech to a halt against the Bangalore outfit. This is despite the fact that HAL are second from the bottom with seven points. Bhowmick admitted on Friday that finishing the first phase with at the record 27-point mark would be a huge boost, but his team was not complacent. Theres no room for complacency, because we still have a long way to go. But well play to win. East Bengal had beaten HAL 5-3 in Bangalore in the first phase.  Copyright

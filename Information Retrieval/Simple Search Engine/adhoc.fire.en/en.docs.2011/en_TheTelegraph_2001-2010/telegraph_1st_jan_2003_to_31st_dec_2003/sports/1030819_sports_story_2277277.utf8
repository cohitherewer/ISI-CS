 Fitness is Zaheers focus 
Bangalore: With Jawagal Srinath in the twilight of his career, Zaheer Khan is working hard towards becoming Indias principal strike bowler and believes fitness is going to be the key. Its a huge responsibility and great honour to become the leading bowler, Zaheer said on Monday, when asked about the prospect of becoming the strike bowler, as Srinath is doubtful for the upcoming series against New Zealand. With the responsibility, the pressure is going to be more and expectations very high. I am working hard, he said. Zaheer said his aim is to get into the same rhythm as last season. If I bowl well, wickets are going to come, sooner or later. I should be able to deliver at consistent pace. (PTI)  Copyright

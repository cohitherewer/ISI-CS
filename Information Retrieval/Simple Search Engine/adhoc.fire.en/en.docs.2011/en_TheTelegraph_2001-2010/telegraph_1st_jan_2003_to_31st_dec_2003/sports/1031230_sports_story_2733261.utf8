 Churchill hold Salgaocar 
Margao: Churchill Brothers held Salgaocar 2-2 after being reduced to 10 men in a National Football League match here Monday. While Freddy Mascarenhas and Jatin Bisht scored for Salgaocar, Churchill Brothers retaliated via John Kingsley and Roque Parreira. Churchill now have 11 points from six matches while Salgaocar have seven from as many games. With the teams trying to gauge each others strength, Salgaocar took lead in the 14th minute when a move from the left saw Felix Ibrebru getting the better of defender Osumanu Hussaini and sent a waist-high cross to Mascarenhas who controlled the ball and put it in. Churchill equalised the next minute when Yakubu relayed to Ratan Singh on the right and the latter sent a cross which Kingsley nodded home. A minute before the interval, Churchill took the lead when Yakubu, after getting the ball on the left, got the better of rival defender and sent a goalmouth cross for Parreira whose left-footer found the back of the net. Salgaocar played with more zeal in the second session and restored parity in the 51st minute. A counter attack on the right saw a Ragi Singh shot blocked by defender Osumanu and the deflection came to Bisht whose grounder found the net. Churchill were reduced to 10 men in 62nd minute when Kingley got his second yellow card. Salgaocar, lacked the creativity to punch holes into the rival defence. Churchill also played an attacking game and came close to taking the lead but Yakubu was late in connecting a cross from the right.  (PTI)  Copyright

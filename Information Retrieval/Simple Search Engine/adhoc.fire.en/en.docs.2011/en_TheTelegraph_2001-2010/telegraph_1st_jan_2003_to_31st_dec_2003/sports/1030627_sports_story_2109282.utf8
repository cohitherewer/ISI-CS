The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leader cant wait for others to catch up
 - The worlds No. 1 coach, John Buchanan, warns there wont be any let-up in the 2003-2004 season  BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  John Buchanan at a city hotel Thursday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Coach John Buchanan has a new look, but Australias ruthless being-on-top-of-the-world approach wont change in the next season, which begins unusually early  in July. Incidentally, Team India will be touring Australia end-November onwards. I dont think its going to be good for cricket if the leader waits for others to catch up Its others who should aspire to play at a particular levelSure, one looks at even competition but, in my opinion, that must consistently be at a higher and not a lower standard, Buchanan told The Telegraph, Thursday evening. In the city as guest speaker (on managing champion teams) for HSBC, he added: There wont, then, be any let-up in our approach against Bangladesh next month. When players wear the baggy green, that 100 per cent will always be there. However, Buchanan acknowledged that, sub-consciously, the bit about playing Bangladesh did exist. Whether thats going to manifest itself on the field is something that remains to be seen, the coach pointed out. But, surely, his own planning will be a little different Yes, I dont think it will be in that much detail Shouldnt be too Having said that, generally, the motivation wont be low because the two-Test series will be a first and, then, Darwin and Cairns will both be new centres Buchanan replied. Significantly, he didnt dismiss Dennis Lillees suggestion that the ICC restructure the ten Test-playing nations club into two divisions, thereby separating the under-performing sides from the more accomplished ones. Im not saying what Dennis has said is the only view. At the same time, I agree there must be a system of review That, indeed, will be healthy. Moreover, no suggestion should be brushed aside, Buchanan opined. His contract, by the way, is being renegotiated with the Australian Cricket Board (Cricket Australia from July 1) and he indicated changes have been sought. For obvious reasons, specifics werent divulged. Asked just how much longer should Steve Waugh continue to play (and lead the Test side), Buchanan grinned: Its always nice to have Steve around, but I dont have a say in his future Its for him and the selectors to take a decision after the Bangladesh-series. Usually, the sports hottest coach doesnt talk much about individuals, but he didnt duck the query on senior pro Glenn McGraths conduct vis--vis Ramnaresh Sarwan in the recent Antigua Test. Hes sorry that incident occurred, Im sorry it happened Its something that shouldnt be repeated If I may add, theres a case for reviewing things in the next six-eight months, Buchanan said, conveying his unhappiness over what unfolded at St Johns. His only other visit to Calcutta, by the way, was 27 months ago when Sourav Gangulys side pulled off an epic victory at the Eden. Today, he has vivid memories of that great game and series. Had I been more experienced, I could have thought of something else Our response to the situation, therefore, may well have been different. Only, thats Buchanan, who jogged on the Maidan (soon after checking into his hotel) and didnt miss the Edens floodlight towers, trailed off. This time, of course, he is sans that trademark moustache and is struggling to get some of the hair back on his head. Laughing, Buchanan revealed having promised Ricky Ponting and Co. that he would shave off both if Australia retained the World Cup. Well, Australia did. Actually, I did tell the boys that I need not keep my side of the bargain as I didnt shave off both in South Africa itself. But, then, they insisted I keep my word and, so, I went clean during the closing stages of our West Indies tour, Buchanan signed off. The coachs assignment-with-a-difference is slated for Friday night and he will be off to Australia the day after.  Copyright

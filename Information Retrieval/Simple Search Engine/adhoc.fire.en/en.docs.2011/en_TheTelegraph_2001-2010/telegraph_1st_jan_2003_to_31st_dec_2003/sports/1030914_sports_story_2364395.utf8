 Procter praise for Pak security 
		 Mike ProcterLahore, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Security arrangements in Pakistan were praised by International Cricket Council (ICC) Match Referee Mike Procter on Saturday. I have found the arrangements including the security to be excellent, Procter, who has been in Pakistan since last month to supervise the series against Bangladesh, said. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has done everything to ensure nothing goes wrong for the teams and officials. I had no problems coming back to Pakistan for this series as the hospitality is very good and the people are also very friendly. A three-member delegation from South Africa will arrive in Pakistan on Sunday to inspect the security arrangements for the South Africa team, who are due to play three Tests and three one-day Internationals in Pakistan from September 22. The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) said it was concerned about the teams matches in Karachi and Peshawar after it received South African government advice against going to the two cities. The UCBSA wants the matches from these two venues shifted to safer places. The PCB has tried to convince the UCBSA that it would be logistically impossible to change the venues and has also assured the South Africans of state-level security. It would not be fair for me to comment on the UCBSA stand on playing in Karachi and Peshawar, but they have been in touch with me and taken feedback from me, said South African Procter. I have given them my frank views. But I can understand that the negative image about some cities in Pakistan to the outside world does have a bearing on how others think about playing in Pakistan.

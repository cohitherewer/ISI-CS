 Leeds suspend Morris 
Leeds: Leeds United said on Thursday they had suspended Jody Morris, arrested in connection with an alleged sexual assault, for 14 days. Morris, 24, was arrested on Tuesday at the clubs training ground and was held overnight by police investigating claims of an assault on a 20-year-old woman. Leeds United AFC has had a meeting with Jody Morris and his solicitor this morning. In accordance with the standard provisions of the players contract of employment, he has been suspended for up to 14 days to enable the club to conduct an internal investigation, Leeds said in a statement on their website. Earlier, Morris was released on bail after he was arrested with another man, who is not believed not to be a footballer, at the clubs Thorp Arch training ground on Tuesday. A West Yorkshire Police spokeswoman confirmed that two men had been released pending further forensic investigations and said the inquiry was continuing. Inquiries into the incident are continuing but we do not anticipate issuing any further updates in the near future. The case in Leeds is not connected to an investigation into allegations by a 17-year-old girl that she was gang raped by several Premiership footballers. No arrest has yet been done in that case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Buchanan all praise for India
Mumbai: Australian coach John Buchanan said on Monday that the present Indian team looks stronger than the one that toured Australia in 1999. Indias batting has always been quite strong but with the introduction of youth, their fielding and bowling too has improved, Buchanan, who has been invited here by HSBC to give series of lectures for corporates, said. Players like Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh, Virender Sehwag and Mohammed Kaif have made the Indians look stronger, he said. Meanwhile, the ACB will provide technical and administrative help tothe Asian Cricket Council to set up three regional academies in Dubai, Johar Baru and Kathmandu this year. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Mixed day for Indians 
New Delhi: The Indian shuttlers had a mixed day at the Indonesian Open badminton tournament on Wednesday with three players making it to the second round and an equal number crashing out of the event being held in Jakarta. While former All-England champion Pullela Gopichand, national champion Abhinn Shyam Gupta and B.R. Meenakshi comfortably reached the round of 32, southpaw Nikhil Kanetkar, national champion Aparna Popat and Trupti Murgunde were made to bite the dust, according to information received here. Gopichand, who had to qualify for the main draw due to his low ranking following a long injury layoff, had no problem in defeating Englishman Aamir Ghaffar 15-8, 15-7 while national champion Gupta got the better of Antti Vitikko of Finland 15-12, 15-9 to move into the second round. The Hyderabad-based shuttler will now take on 4th seed Sony Dwi Kuncoro of Indonesia while Gupta will face 14th seed Malaysian M. Roslin Hashim. But the top ranked Indian player Kanetkar had no answer to the attacking game of the Chinese qualifier Yungyong Wu as he lost in straight games 8-15, 9-15. In the womens section, Meenakshi kept the Indian hopes alive amidst defeats of her teammates. She thrashed local girl Priyanti Cahyaning 11-4, 11-3 and runs into fourth seed Chen Wang of Hong Kong for the pre-quarter final berth. Meanwhile, 33-ranked Popat was outclassed by 88th ranked qualifier Chia Chi Huang of Chinese Taipei, losing the tie 7-11, 12-13. In the other tie, Murgunde was no match to world No. 2 Ruina Gong as she surrendered meekly 6-11, 1-11.  (PTI)  Copyright

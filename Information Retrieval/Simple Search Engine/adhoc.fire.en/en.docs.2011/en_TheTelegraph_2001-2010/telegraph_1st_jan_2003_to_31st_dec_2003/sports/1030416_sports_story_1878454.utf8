 Carlos appeal turned down 
Zurich: Roberto Carlos has had his appeal against a provisional ban from all international matches rejected, world soccers governing body Fifa said on Tuesday. The Brazilian World Cup winner was provisionally banned from playing for his country on April 7 following his dismissal for pushing referee Alon Yefet, of Israel, in a 1-2 friendly defeat by Portugal on March 29. The Real Madrid defender appealed the decision, but Fifas disciplinary committee chairman Marcel Mathier turned down the request after viewing video evidence and the referees report.

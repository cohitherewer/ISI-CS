 Ban hit me like a thunderbolt: Ferdinand 
 Ferguson thinks the best thing for Ferdinand is to concentrate on playing football London: Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand says he was shocked and devastated with the eight-month ban he received for failing to show for a drugs test. In his first reaction to Fridays sanction imposed by the English Football Association, Ferdinand told the Sun newspaper that the decision hit me like a thunderbolt. I was shocked and devastated when I heard the verdict, said Ferdinand who is to appeal the ban, which is due to start on January 12. Ferdinand played in the Manchester United side which defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 on Sunday in the Premiership at White Hart Lane and his manager Alex Ferguson sung his praises afterwards. Ferguson defended his decision to play Ferdinand, telling Sky Sports: I was very pleased with him. It was probably the best thing for him, to get everything out of his mind and concentrate on playing football. He acquitted himself very well in the circumstances. His performances merit his place in the team. Since this all happened he has got better and better. He has great maturity and a great partnership with (Mikael) Silvestre so why should I leave him out? Ferdinand was also fined 50,000 pounds (88,000 dollars) for missing the drugs test on September 23 at Uniteds training ground. His appeal against the ban means he can continue to play until the result of that appeal is known. There have also been reports that Manchester United and Ferdinand could challenge the drugs test ban before a civil court inciting the wrath of Fifa chief Sepp Blatter who insists it is a matter for the football authorities.

 Hurricane Chanderpaul ton after early setbacks
Georgetown: West Indies Shivnarine Chanderpaul scored the third fastest hundred in Test history Thursday as he led a remarkable fightback against Australia in the first Test. The West Indies were all out for 237. Ridley Jacobs remained unbeaten on 54. Andy Bichel took three for 55. Chanderpaul, batting at six and better known for his adhesive rather than attacking qualities, hit leg spinner Stuart MacGill for four to reach three figures from 70 deliveries before kissing the ground. The quickest Test century, by Viv Richards, came off 56 balls against England in 1985-86. His innings, which ended moments later on 100 and included 15 fours and two sixes, was part of a 131-run sixth-wicket stand with Ridley Jacobs as West Indies recovered from 53 for five to reach 193 for seven deep into the afternoon session. Even more remarkably, Jacobs was using a runner at the other end after straining a hamstring. He made 26 during the partnership which ended when Chanderpaul, pulling, fell lbw to quick bowler Andy Bichel. Moments later Bichel also Vasbert Drakes for a duck, wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist scooping up a fine one-handed catch. Steve Waugh, featuring in a world-record 157th Test after missing the World Cup, spent the opening morning applauding his bowlers as they reduced West Indies to 89 for five by lunch. Australia, seeking to return to the top of the world Test standings and fielding five specialist bowlers, broke through with wickets in successive overs to reduce their hosts to ten for two before left-arm wrist spinner Brad Hogg struck in successive deliveries. Brian Lara then fell to Bichel to leave Waughs men in control.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Iran rock TFA hopes
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur, Sept 20: India TFA Whites hopes of making the JRD Tata Cup final were dashed when TFA Blue conceded an injury-time goal to go down 1-2 to Iran on Saturday. Iran will take on Uzbekistan in the final on Monday, who ensured their place in the title- round with a win against TFA White. Mehrdad Oladi Ghadikolaies 93rd minute strike following keeper Subhashish Roy Chowdhurys error cost TFA Blue dear. Milad Midavoodi had given Iran the lead in the 31st minute. The Indians drew level in the 83rd minute when Sumit Thapa slotted the ball in following a Khemtang Paite pass. Coach Stephen Constantine held Subhashish responsible for the loss.  Copyright

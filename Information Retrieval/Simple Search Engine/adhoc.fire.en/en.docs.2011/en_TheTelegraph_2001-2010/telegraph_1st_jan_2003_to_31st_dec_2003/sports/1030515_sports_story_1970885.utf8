 Fina to consider Hackett request 
Melbourne: Australian Swimming said on Wednesday that Fina is considering 1,500m world record holder Grant Hacketts request to reschedule the 800 and 1,500m races at Julys world titles in Barcelona, Spain. Hackett wrote to Fina asking if the programme listing the 800 and 1,500 on successive days could be changed. He was supported by Australian Swimming chief executive Glenn Tasker, who said a reply from Fina had been received. Tasker said a subcommittee of the governing body would examine the programme at the championships to see if there was an option to staging the events on consecutive days. He said the reply to Hackett, also the 1,500m Olympic and world champion, indicated Fina understood perfectly well Hacketts request. We have instructed the commission to look carefully at this issue, the Fina letter said. Hackett has one of the heaviest workloads at the championships. As well as the 800 and 1,500m he is also likely to contest the freestyle 200 and 400m and 400 and 800 relays.  (AP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saurav is runner-up
Chennai: Indias Saurav Ghoshal had to be content with the runner-up spot as he lost to Australias Mike Corren 14-15, 6-15, 10-15 in the final of the Professional Squash Association Country View Squash Open at Kuala Lumpur on Monday. Ghoshal, ranked 200 places behind 29-year-old Corren, played superbly in the first game but then ran out of steam in the next two as he saw his dream run come to an end, a press release from the Squash Rackets Federation of India said.

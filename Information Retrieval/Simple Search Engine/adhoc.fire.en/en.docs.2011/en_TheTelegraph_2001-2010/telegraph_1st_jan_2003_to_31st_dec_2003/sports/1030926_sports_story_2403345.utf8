 Dutch visit may force Indian pull-out
Kuala Lumpur: India may have to pull out of the Sultan Azlan Shah hockey meet, slated here next January, owing to their commitment to the Dutch team which has been invited to play five Tests in India during the same time. India had been invited informally to participate in Azlan Shah meet, but since a formal confirmation was not made, it was decided to go ahead and play a Test series with the Netherlands at home, IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran said Thursday. Our participation in the Azlan Shah is doubtful as we have committed to play five Tests with the Dutch team late January, said Jyothikumaran. (PTI)  Copyright

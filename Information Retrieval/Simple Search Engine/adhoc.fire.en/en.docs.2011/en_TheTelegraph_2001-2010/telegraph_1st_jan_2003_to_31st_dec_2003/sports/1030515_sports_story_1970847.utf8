The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sarwan, McGrath make up 
Sydney: Australian paceman Glenn McGrath and West Indies vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan have apologised to each other over their ugly confrontation in the fourth Test in Antigua. Sarwan said on Wednesday he and McGrath had cleared the air over the mid-pitch altercation on Monday which had concerned the ACB enough to issue a statement. Sarwan, whose century helped steer the West Indies to a record-breaking three-wicket win in the dead final match of the four-Test series Tuesday, would not reveal what was said between the two players in the clash which caused McGrath to fly into such a finger-pointing rage that umpire David Shepherd had to step in. But Sarwan was confident they remained on friendly terms. Actually both of us have apologised to each other and we did that in the good context of the game and what took place in the series and this game, Sarwan told an Australian radio station. Its good that we have apologised to each other and we appreciate each others friendship. Asked about the Australian teams reputation as a world leader in sledging, Sarwan said the West Indies team had no grievance with Steve Waughs men. Im not sure about that, whos the leader of that (sledging), but obviously players have things to say on the field and its up to the individual or a team if you want to take it personal but, really and truly, we dont have a problem with each other, he said. You just need to accept certain things that people say on the field and if you put it in the past, thats fine, but if you take it personal well, then I think you might find yourself in a bit of trouble. ACB chief executive James Sutherland told Waugh to rein in his players emotions after the unseemly outburst.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 No point having the best plans if I  dont have players to implement them: Fleming
 - I am an inclusive captain...  the 15th man has as much say as anybody else FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Stephen Fleming:  I am not a great player, but I can be a good one  Centurion: Stephen Fleming  wasnt yet 24 when he got the New Zealand captaincy in 1996-97.  Gradually, of course, the Black Caps youngest captain has  emerged as among the most respected on the circuit, with  a handsome 54-plus success percentage in Tests. Fleming spoke to The Telegraph,  exclusively on captaincy, over breakfast Thursday. The half-hour  chat, at the Intercontinental Sandton Sun amp; Towers in  Johannesburg, saw him make some fascinating points. The following are excerpts On regularly getting accolades  for his captaincy (Smiles) Its very nice,  very flattering... Specially when former captains, whom  you respect, have kind words... At the same time, the comments  are a reflection on my team... The team allows me to try  a few things, enables me to experiment.  On whether the appreciation  puts him under pressure No, because I dont plan and plot  to be seen as a good captain... I do so to win matches.  I dont try to be innovative to earn accolades, theres  a purpose behind trying something different. (After a  pause) In fact, the team is involved in a big way...  We collectively think of ways to exploit weaknesses. Very  often, then, the ideas come from the players themselves  and its for me to time the implementation right. Indeed,  its very much a timing thing. On being a democratic captain Im an inclusive captain... For  me, its important that the 15th man has as much of a say  as anybody else. It allows everybody to have an ownership  in the team plans, thereby making for more involvement and  satisfaction. On captaincy Good question... (After a pause)  Much of it has to do with implementing what your team  wants, its about giving direction to a set of ideas...  Basically, the team drives the way it wants to play... My  job is largely to give direction, get the timing right   on and off the field. On off-the-field captaincy Look, the team decides the disciplines  and those must be adhered to. We are very particular about  timings... There are other aspects too and I would like  to think this discipline has contributed to our on-field  success. I adhere to the disciplines as much as anybody  else. On how innovative a captain  can be, given that the laws are set in stone and the playing  conditions standardised The team dictates that... I look  at the strengths of my side and see how that can be utilised  to open up weaknesses in the opposition. I mean, theres  no point having the best plans in the world if I dont have  the players to implement them. On whether he has had a  role model captain Ive been heavily influenced by  my idol, Martin Crowe, who was an innovative captain...  He continues to think outside the square, so to say. Then,  at different times, Ive spoken to Ian Chappell and Mark  Taylor and Steve Waugh... Ive tried to pick up a few things  but, at the end of the day, Im my own captain... (After  a pause) I cant keep my eyes shut when it comes to  techniques adopted by different teams.  On interacting with Steve He was gracious enough to spend  time with me in my early years as captain and, then, we  had a chat during our trip to Australia in 2001-2002...  He spoke about captaincy and batting and I was an avid listener...  I knew I could pick up the odd idea. On whether he envies any  one contemporary I like comparing teams, not captains.  Each captains style, after all, is dictated to by the team. On Sourav Ganguly, his Indian  counterpart I appreciate the pressure (driven  by expectations) that he is under. Besides that, Im not  going to comment. On how tough or easy is  it captaining New Zealand Its easy... My players are better  than what they are given credit for... As a team, we are  under no illusions, we know what weve got to do... Stars  have to be a bit individualistic to be exceptional and,  often, that may not fit into the teams plans... We dont  have to contend with a problem like that... We do, of course,  realise weve got to be at our best every single day.  On New Zealand being the  perennial underdogs Its frustrating when we do well  and thats projected as the opposition doing badly... Being  consistent is one way of proving people wrong... We are  working towards that... Weve already shown we can, on our  day, beat anyone. However, let it be clear my team is wholly  driven by what it can achieve.  On his approach to a series/tournament The coaching staff and I view  a lot of footage and, invariably, ideas on tackling the  opposition get generated. A number of minds thinking alike  will surely produce something interesting. Ive always believed  that you dont have to play the same way all the time...  That, with slight innovations, you can make it interesting.  For instance, weve adopted the relay-throw, which has proved  effective. On whether it was his idea (Laughs) Dont remember  who actually thought of it, but we experimented at training  (during last Septembers Champions Trophy) and, satisfied  with the time taken, decided to adopt that.  On handling the pressures  associated with captaincy On the flip-side, captains get  more accolades, the financial rewards are better... So,  there are two sides to the captaincy-coin... Being honest  is one way of not adding to pressure and, clearly, Im just  that in my dealings.  On whether he reads the  Riot Act The players know when they havent  got their act right... For me, attitude is most important  as that dictates performance.  On attitude Fielding is a good guide... If  the guy at the boundary is simply going through the motions,  then he hasnt really switched-on and lacks attitude...  Little things count, little acts are a give away... On leading from the front Its important, but not more so  than the standards a captain sets. I know Im not a great  player, but do know I can be a good one... It helps if a  batsman-captain gets runs as his confidence grows and decision  making possibly becomes easier. On whether he is devastated  if a move doesnt come off No, I look at the next one. Or  the third move, or the fourth... I have options, but I also  have the belief that my moves can work.  On whether a captain can  actually enhance a players self-belief Why not? Moreover, I keep everybody  involved so that every single player feels he has a role  to play. Everybody takes pride in our success. On what has he learnt in  seven seasons as captain Learnt to be thick-skinned, learnt  to not waver once Ive decided on a particular move... I  wasnt prepared when I got the captaincy (1996-97), but  the first few years were a honeymoon... Its in the last  couple of years that expectations have grown, that the hard  period has started. On whether there has been  a turning point in his captaincy (Laughs again) Havent  had one. Instead, Ive been experiencing a learning curve  that, at times, has been steep... I know Ive got to keep  learning, though. On whether he manages time  to unwind Try to... My golf is pretty okay  (eight handicap) and Im learning the guitar and scuba diving...  Finally, on whether captains  have a shelf life They do, absolutely... A captain  knows when the time has come to stop... (After a pause)  Im happy that our selectors have shown so much faith and  that Ive not had to undergo the experience of some captains...  Our selectors have been consistent with the team as well.

 Belgian belles in No. 1 battle 
 Justine Henin-Hardenne Los Angeles: Belgian rivals Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin-Hardenne will battle to the bitter end for the WTA Tours year-ending world No. 1 ranking as the season wraps up this week with the elite Tour Championships. I think its great to see that the last tournament of the year, its going to depend on that, said Clijsters, whose victory in this event last year was the first step in her climb to the top of the rankings. If it would happen it would be great, she said of ending the year as number one. Especially at this tournament, its what started it all for me. While Clijsters has dominated the rankings, she hasnt managed to match Henin-Hardennes two Grand Slam titles  at the French Open and US Open. If I can finish the year No. 1, it would be perfect, Henin-Hardenne said. Id like to come back in 2004 as number one. Henin-Hardennes chances may have suffered a slight blow as she arrived in Los Angeles nursing a severe cold accompanied by a fever. She said on Tuesday, however, that she hoped a course of antibiotics would help, as would the fact that she wont have to play her first match until Thursday. Clijsters headlines the opening days programme, taking on Russian Elena Dementieva in the third of three matches. Frances Amelie Mauresmo opens the action against American Chanda Rubin while American Jennifer Capriati plays Japans Ai Sugiyama. Under the new format adopted this year, eight players play a round-robin first round of three matches. For the crowd I think its the best format, for the players, too, Clijsters said. You see the best players play against everybody. I think itll be exciting, said Capriati. Because if you lose the first match it doesnt necessarily mean youre out of it. You can really get into it. Especially for people who are slow starters, or not used to the court, its good, the American added. While the joint rise of two players from the relatively small nation of Belgium means that Clijsters and Henin-Hardenne are linked in the minds of tennis fans, their relationship has often been uneasy, and it appears to remain so. Clijsters describes their relations as friendly but is reluctant to say much more. Everything has been blown out of proportion, said Clijsters. I dont want to say anything. It will start again. Henin-Hardenne was perhaps a bit more frosty as she sat at a table on the floor of the vast Staples Center on Tuesday. Have we ever been really, really close friends? Thats the question, Henin-Hardenne said. There is a lot of respect between each other.  (AFP)  Copyright

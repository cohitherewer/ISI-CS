		 Thursday, January 02, 2003 				 TFA lapses let JCT through
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT																								New Delhi: The New Year didnt bring good news for some, as defensive errors stuck out like a sore thumb in the Pepsi 115th Durand Cup football tournament here Wednesday.																								On slushy, slippery surface Tata Football Academy (TFA) dominated proceedings but lost 0-2 due to defensive errors against five-time champions JCT in group A, while Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) Bangalore and Army XI drew 2-2.																								Meanwhile both East Bengal and Salgaocar (Goa) arrived in Delhi Wednesday.																								East Bengal are without coach Subhas Bhowmick and striker Mike Okoro, said assistant coach Bikash Panji. The two reach here Thursday. East Bengal kick-off against Air India in a group B match Saturday.																								Army XI shot ahead in the 17th minute, when ITI right back Akshay Das tripped striker Pritam Bahadur in the box. Striker Raghu Kumar converted the resultant penalty. Eight minutes later ITI equalised as Ghanaian recruit Ibrahim Karim sped down the right flank, cut in and scored with a grounder.																								ITI forged ahead in the 34th minute with a gift goal. Former international striker Mohammed Najeeb, recovering from injury sent a measured cross, from the left. Army XIs stopper Ignatious, in trying to clear, deflected the ball into his own net.																								With former international Tajinder Kumar and right midfielder James Singh controlling proceedings, ITI were cruising to victory. However their international custodian N. Balaji, gave a New Years Day present to Army XI. He dived late and allowed midfielder Johnny Gangmeis innocuous top of the box left footer to creep in. 																								JCTs first goal came in the 39th minute from Hardip Gill. Gill was involved in the second goal too, when he was tripped by Habibur Rahman Mondal in the penalty area. Referee Pradeep Kumar had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and Hardip Saini converted in the 83rd minute.																								Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sportings Liberian forward Eugene Grays international clearance certificate hasnt arrived and his playing in the Durand Cup is unlikely. 																								Thursdays matches: Assam Regimental Centre vs PSEB; Air India vs MEG Bangalore.

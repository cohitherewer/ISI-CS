 Turkmenistan coach slams food, practice facilities
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT BHARTI: Guilty of hard tackle New Delhi: Turkmenistan football coach Rovshan Muhadov on Tuesday slammed the food and practice facilities here, on the eve of his teams departure for Goa to play the return leg of the pre-Olympic tie on Sunday. Speaking after his team thrashed an assembled Delhi XI 3-0 in a friendly match, Muhadov also said Indias complaints about the 93rd minute, added time penalty kick in the first leg tie, in Ashkhabad on April 5 was unjustified. Muhadov said Indian skipper Satish Bhartis hard tackle from behind on striker Vyacheslav Krendelev was a justified penalty as the defender had not made contact with the ball. The Turkmenistan coach was reacting to India coach Stephen Constantines grouse that the penalty kick defied logic. In fact, Muhadov said the Iranian referee overlooked another legitimate claim for a penalty kick midway through the second half, following a wild tackle from behind by an Indian defender.However he did admit that the penalty kick goal by his son Rasif Kerimov gave his team a decisive advantage, a 2-0 home win. He felt that if his team had to play an away match with just a 1-0 win at home, India would have been favoured to qualify. Muhadov added that his team was not used to playing before large crowds and if a large crowd cheered India in Goa it could be a worrying factor. For the tie at Ashkhabad entry was free but still, only about 3,000 people attended the match.The Turkmen coach is hopeful that practice for two days in Delhi will help his side get accustomed to the heat and humidity of Goa. ASHIM: Looked quite impressive Muhadov said that his team would play in the 3-5-2 formation and would start aggressively to get a vital away goal. Talking about the Indian players, Muhadov complimented their control, game sense and skills. He said Indias defence was well organised and the forwards Ashim Biswas, Alex Ambrose and substitute Ishfaq Ahmed impressed.Unlike Indias team, which had just five days practise, before the first leg tie on April 5, Turkmenistan have been training since the completion of their National League in February. Coach Muhadov said that his team had played friendly matches with Lokomotiv Moscow, Atlanata club Lithuania and an Estonia XI. All eighteen players in their squad are professionals and three of them play in the Ukrainian league. They are strikers Guvanchmuhamet Ovekov ( Arsenal F.C Kiev), Hasmagomed Amayev (Torpedo F.C. Kutaisi) and Nazar Bayaramov (Vorskla F.V. Poltava).Seven of the 18 member squad are from Nisa F.C. which came second in the ten team Turkmenistan national league. Five are from five times national league champions Kopetdag F.C. of Ashkhabad. Muhadov himself is also from this club. During his playing career Muhadov played for Pakhtakor in Uzbekistan, Pamir Toshnabe of Kazakhstan, Kopetdag in Turkmenistan  Copyright

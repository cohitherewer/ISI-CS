The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kale gets time to reply
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The BCCI has given Abhijit Kale some more time to offer his side of the story. That is, in effect, extra time on his show-cause deadline in the money-for-selection scandal. The BCCIs three-member disciplinary committee on December 11 had demanded an explanation from Kale, asking him to elaborate on his conduct. He was reportedly set a 15-day deadline. On Tuesday BCCI secretary S.K. Nair told The Telegraph from Thiruvananthapuram that Kale has urged the board to let him have a look at documents incriminating him. He is likely to see those papers in Thiruvananthapuram on January 6-7 and will be asked to send in his reply soon after the inspection, Nair said. He didnt say that the deadline (if any had been strictly set) has been extended, but added Kale has been granted the time he requested. According to another source, however, the BCCI had initially set a deadline, but is now willing to wait till January 15 for Kale to submit his reply.  Copyright

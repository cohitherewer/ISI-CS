				 	 Fallon				 										Ascot, England (Reuters): Mr Dinos, ridden by champion jockey Kieren Fallon, galloped to a six-length victory in the Ascot Gold Cup on Thursday at odds of 3-1.				 										Second place in the 12 strong field went to veteran stayer Persion Punch (20-1), with Pole Star (12-1) three quarters of a length away in third.				 										The disappointment of the race was Mamool, the 5-2 favourite ridden by Frankie Dettori, who was a well-beaten fifth.				 										The Gold Cup, a supreme test for stayers, is run over 2-1/2 miles and is the highlight of the third day of the five-day Royal meeting.

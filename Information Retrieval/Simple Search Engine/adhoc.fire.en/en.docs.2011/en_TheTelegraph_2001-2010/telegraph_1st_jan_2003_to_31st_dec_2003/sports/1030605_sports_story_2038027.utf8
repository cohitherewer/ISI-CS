 Indian pace has come of age under Srinath: Donald
 Allan Donald Mumbai: Former South African paceman Allan Donald has lauded the performances of Indian speedsters  Jawagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra  in the World Cup in South Africa. He was speaking from Johannesburg Tuesday during the launch of Mahindra and Mahindras Scorpio speedster hunt, a unique quest for Indias next generation of match-winning fast bowlers. Donald said over the phone: The key to fast bowling is the body-shoulder co-ordination followed by upright delivery action. In fact, the Indian pace department has really come of age under the guidance of Srinath, who has been instrumental in the success of the two left arm seamers Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra along with Ajit Agarkar in the recent past. I think this is a very good initiative on part of the people involved to unearth young fast bowling talent in India. When I was in India last time around, it was nice to see a young man (Abey Kuruvilla) run-in pretty fast which surprised us (South African team).  When we were in India, Sachin (Tendulkar) had said the pitches in India were spinner friendly which came true during the Test series. To produce fast bowlers I think respective associations should prepare more and more hard and fast wickets with good bounce.  (PTI)  Copyright

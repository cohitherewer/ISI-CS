 Mukesh keeps title
Chennai, Sept. 6 (PTI): Mukesh Kumar successfully defended his title at the Hyundai Open golf tournament here on Saturday. Mukesh, who went in to the final round Saturday with a seven-stroke cushion, dropped a shot to card one over 71. But for the seven-stroke lead it would have been tough for him, because Rafiq Ali had closed in with a two under par 68 to grab the runners-up spot at 275. Calcuttas Uttam Singh Mundy was third with 276. Mundy submitted the best card for the final day with a four under 66.  Copyright

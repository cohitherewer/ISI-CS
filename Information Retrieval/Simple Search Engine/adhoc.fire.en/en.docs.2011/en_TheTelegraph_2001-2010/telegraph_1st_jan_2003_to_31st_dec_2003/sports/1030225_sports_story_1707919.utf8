The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Waqar in search of Imran-like impetus
				Paarl: Captain Waqar Younis may have missed the 1992 World Cup because of injury but hopes to use Pakistans triumph that year as inspiration to rescue his teams faltering 2003 campaign. Pakistan play Holland here at BoE Park on Tuesday, knowing they need to win their remaining three group A matches to reach the Super Six phase. After defeats against Australia and England, Pakistan are languishing in fifth place , with Australia, England and India all two wins ahead of them. After the Holland match, Pakistan have to play India at Centurion on Saturday and Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on March 4. All these three games are crucial, said Waqar. Its a World Cup.  Eleven years ago, skipper Imran Khan famously exhorted his players to attack, attack, attack and they won three successive matches to scrape into the semis, then won twice more to lift the trophy. Asked whether he could emulate Imran, Waqar admitted: I dont know how he did it because I wasnt there, but Im going to give it my best shot. Waqar admitted that the teams batting had been disappointing but said major changes were unlikely.

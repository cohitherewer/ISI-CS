The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Randhawa, Wi beat Japan duo
 Team Asias Charlie Wi and Jyoti Randhawa celebrate their victory on Day I of the Dynasty Cup in Shenzhen Friday. (AFP) Shenzhen: Asia put up a stronger than expected showing and came out with honours shared at the end of opening day of the inaugural Phoenix Dynasty Cup, which began at the magnificent World Cup course of the Mission Hill Golf Club here on Friday. The local pair of Zhang Lian-Wei and Liang Wen-Chong gave the Asian team a perfect start beating Hajime Meshiai and Nobuhito Sato on the final hole. Thais Thongchai Jaidee and Prayad Marksaeng won 2 and 1 against Toru Suzuki and Katsunori Kuwabara, while Indias Jyoti Randhawa and Korean Charlie Wi combined to beat Kiyoshi Murota and Yasuharu Imano of Japan by a similar margin. The Japanese pulled back through Hiroki Fujita and Katsumasa Miyamoto, who came back from two down to beat the Indian pair of Arjun Atwal and Jeev Milkha Singh 3 and 1. Randhawa, No. 1 on the Asian PGA Tour in 2002, and Wi were in the final fourball and needed to win their match with Japan leading 3-2 at that stage. The Asians lost the opening two holes but combined well thereafter. They won the third and fifth to draw level. After being one down on the 14th tee, they turned up the heat and won the next three holes to go two-up after 16. Once the 17th was halved, the Asian team got the necessary point to draw level with Japan. Jeev and Arjun started off in rousing fashion. Things started going wrong for them on the par-3 fifth when Jeev hit his tee shot to the left of the green and Arjuns chip went almost 20 feet past the hole. The Japanese pulled level on the next hole. The Indian pair levelled scores winning the ninth, thanks to a brilliant 20-footer birdie putt from Jeev. The turning point was the 12th hole where Jeevs pitching wedge shot flew almost 35 feet past the pin and the Asians made a bogey to lose the hole. (PTI)  Copyright

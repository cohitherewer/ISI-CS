 PSGs no to United offer 
Paris: Paris St Germain president Francis Graille said on Wednesday he had turned down an offer by Manchester United for Brazilian striker Ronaldinho. They have confirmed their interest in Ronaldinho and have made an offer which we turned down, Graille said after a meeting with Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon. If they want Ronaldinho, they must do better than this. Now they know what to expect from us, he added. Graille refused to reveal the amount of the offer but denied figures, which had circulated recently in media reports, of 20 million euros ($23.09 million).  (REUTERS)  Copyright

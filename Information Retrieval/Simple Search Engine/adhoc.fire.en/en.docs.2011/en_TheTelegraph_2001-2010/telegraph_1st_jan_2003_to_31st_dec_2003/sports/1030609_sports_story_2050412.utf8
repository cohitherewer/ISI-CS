 Le Roux bids India goodbye
 Le Roux New Delhi: In a sudden development, Adrian le Roux  physical trainer of the Indian cricket team  was appointed trainer of South Africa Sunday. Le Rouxs appointment and his acceptance of the assignment came as a surprise to the Indian cricket board which had recently offered him a one-year extension. The South African had been with the Indian team since early 2002. Though the official papers had not been drawn up yet, the extension offer was a known happening. Le Rouxs performance with the Indian team was well appreciated. Impressed with his work, the BCCI had even asked him to work with trainees at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. However, the trainer gladly accepted the South African offer. He will replace Andrew Gray, who resigned last week. Bronwyn Wilkinson, media officer of the South African board (UCB), said in Durban that Le Roux will soon join the squad in Pretoria at a camp organised ahead of South Africas tour of England. He has been contracted till 2005 and he will also work with the South Africa A team. Le Roux said he had learnt a lot during his stint with the Indian team, and was delighted with the opportunity to work with his own national side. It was a wonderful experience working with India, in a very different cricket culture, and I learnt a great deal with them, Le Roux said in a statement. It is obviously a great privilege to have the opportunity to work with ones own national team and I am looking forward to the challenge. The UCB chief executive Gerald Majola said the team would benefit from Le Roux experience. We are delighted to have a man of Adrians calibre on board. His experience at the highest level will be invaluable, he said. Its also great to have a home-grown man in the job. He will, I am certain, work well with the squad as well as with the A team in maintaining peak fitness levels in what is a very busy year of international cricket. BCCI in the dark The Indian cricket board, however, has not heard anything from Le Roux. Board president Jagmohan Dalmiya and secretary S.K. Nair both said they were yet to be informed. So far, the board has no knowledge about this. We are yet to receive any communication from him (Le Roux), Dalmiya said.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Sachin should open: Azhar
Mumbai: Joining the debate on Sachin Tendulkars batting slot, former skipper Mohammed Azharuddin Friday said the master batsman should open the innings in the World Cup. Azhar, who led India in three World Cups added: I rate Australia as the best team because of their allround excellence. However, I think, whichever team excels in all departments on that particular day will win. Bowling and fielding is where India should brush up to put a good performance. Suit adjourned The examination of witnesses in the suit filed by Azhar challenging the life ban imposed on him by the BCCI in the wake of match-fixing scandal was adjourned to February 13 in Hyderabad Friday. The suit was adjourned as the presiding officer did not attend the city civil court.  (PTI)  Copyright

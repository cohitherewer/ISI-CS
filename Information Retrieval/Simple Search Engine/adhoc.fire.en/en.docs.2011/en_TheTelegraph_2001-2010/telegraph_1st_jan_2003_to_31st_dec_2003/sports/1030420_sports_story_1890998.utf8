 Weir was amazing: Nicklaus
London, April 19 (Reuters): Jack Nicklaus was delighted to write a letter to Canadas Mike Weir earlier this week congratulating him on his US Masters victory, 20 years after giving the same player advice about his swing. Nicklaus, a six-times champion, missed the cut at Augusta National following scores of 85 and 77 but watched on television last Sunday when Weir became the first left-hander to win a major in 40 years, edging out Len Mattiace in a play-off. Let me tell you, I dont watch a lot of golf tournaments on television, I just dont, the 63-year-old Nicklaus was quoted as saying on the PGA Tour website. But I didnt miss a shot of the last 36 holes with Mike playing. What he did was just amazing, because that golf course was obviously not his type of course. They all said it would be set up for a big hitter who worked the ball, and he was one of the shorter hitters off the tee.  Copyright

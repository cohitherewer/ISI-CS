The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Afridi confident of success 
 Afridi Lahore: Discarded allrounder Shahid Afridi on Thursday said he was confident Pakistan A team will win the tri-nation series in India starting next week, raising his chances of a recall to the national team. Playing in India would be a great challenge but we are up to it and I am confident that my side will win the series, Afridi said. A 14-member Pakistan A team with Afridi as captain leaves for India on Friday to face India and Sri Lanka in the meet in Calcutta from December 22. The 23-year-old Afridi was dumped after a poor run in Pakistans dismal first-round exit from the World Cup. He was then banned from a four-nation event in Sharjah in April after he was charged with abusing Virender Sehwag in a World Cup match. Afridi was not considered for the national team and instead played provincial cricket in South Africa. This will be a ladder for me to regain my place in the national team as I am anxiously waiting to play against India on home grounds, said Afridi. (AFP)  Copyright

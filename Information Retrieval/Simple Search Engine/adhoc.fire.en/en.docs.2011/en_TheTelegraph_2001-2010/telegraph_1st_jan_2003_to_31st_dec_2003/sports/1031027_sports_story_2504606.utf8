The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Advani eyes grand double
New Delhi: Newly coronated world snooker champion Pankaj Advani is eager to convert his win into a grand double at the World Billiards Championships in Hyderabad next month. A tough prospect, he said, but that is something worth going for. I will surely try my level best to win the world billiards title to go with this (snooker title), Advani said from Jiangmen in China. But it will be a tough task considering the field of opponents. (PTI)  Copyright

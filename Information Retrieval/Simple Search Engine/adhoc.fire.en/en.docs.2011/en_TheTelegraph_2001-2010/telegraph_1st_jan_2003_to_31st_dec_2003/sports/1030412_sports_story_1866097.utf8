 Shearer plots United downfall 
Newcastle: Newcastle United will be right back in the Premier League title race if they beat Manchester United on Saturday and captain Alan Shearer is relishing the prospect. Newcastle trail leading pair Arsenal and Manchester United by six points as the season enters its decisive stage, but that gap will be halved if they win at St James Park on Saturday, with Arsenal playing in the FA Cup semi-finals on Sunday. Beat Manchester United and we are back in it, Shearer was quoted as saying in Newcastles Evening Chronicle newspaper on Friday. Nobody knows just where we are going to finish in the Premiership table. We have just got to keep on playing and if we beat United then things could be wide open again. Newcastle manager Bobby Robson suggested their hopes of winning a first championship since 1927 were all but over after their controversial 1-2 defeat by Everton last weekend. Its not as though tomorrows game with Manchester United wasnt already an important match but the Everton defeat has added to the importance. We are not worried about our form. In fact, we should get things into perspective, added Shearer.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

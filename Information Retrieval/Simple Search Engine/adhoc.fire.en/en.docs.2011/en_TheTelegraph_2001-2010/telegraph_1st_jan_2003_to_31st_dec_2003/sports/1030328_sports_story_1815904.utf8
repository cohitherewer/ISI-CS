The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sporting have it easy
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Jamshedpur: Mohammedan Sporting handed a 4-1 drubbing to Allwyn Hindustan in a second division National Football League match here at the JRD Tata Sports Complex Thursday. Mohammedan Sporting, favourites to emerge winners here, played with a better sense of purpose and a definite gameplan. The midfielders did a great job, regularly feeding the forwards with quick passes. Mohammedan Sporting drew first blood in the 12th minute when Awal Ibrahim tapped the ball home from just inside the box. The Calcutta side made several other forays into the Allwyn Hindustan territory thereafter but failed to increase the tally. In the second session, the Mohammedan Sporting forwardline found its bearings with the troika of Ibrahim, Dipendu Biswas and Bhuvan Joshi in their element. Dipendu made it 2-0 in the 69th minute. The third goal came in the 73rd minute. Joshi controlled a cross from the right and dodged two defenders before losing control. Ibrahim retrieved the situation and lobbed the ball for Joshi to head it home. Allwyn Hindustan rarely tested Mohammedan Sporting. Abulateef Seriki was the lone threat but lack of support meant the Calcutta side could breathe easy. Seriki succeeded in finding the net in the 87th minute.  Copyright

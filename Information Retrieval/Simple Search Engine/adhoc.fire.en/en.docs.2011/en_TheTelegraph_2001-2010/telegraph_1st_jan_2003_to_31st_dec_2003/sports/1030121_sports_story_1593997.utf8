				 	 LEHMANN: No more slip-ups																								Melbourne: Australias cricketers have been warned about improving their behaviour following Darren Lehmanns five-match ban over his racist outburst and several other incidents involving team mates.																								Australias one-day captain Ricky Ponting said the players were told to start behaving better after a meeting with Australian Cricket Board chairman James Sutherland on Monday.																								A talking-to today from James wont hurt us at all, Ponting said. I suppose with Darren the other day...it was just a bit of a wake-up for all of us, you are in the public eye all the time and youve got to be very careful what you say and what you do all of the time.																								You cant let yourself slip up at all and weve just had a few slip-ups the last couple of weeks.																								Lehmann was suspended for five matches after being found guilty of breaching the sports strict Code of Conduct. He had been overheard making an offensive remark after being dismissed in a limited-overs match with Sri Lanka last week.																								Earlier, Matthew Hayden was fined for smashing the glass door leading to the players changing room and Adam Gilchrist was reprimanded for swearing during the final Ashes Test.

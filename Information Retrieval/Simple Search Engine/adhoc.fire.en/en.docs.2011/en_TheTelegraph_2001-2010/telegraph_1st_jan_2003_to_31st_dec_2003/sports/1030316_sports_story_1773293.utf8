The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indias tie with Hong Kong unlikely
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta: Indias international friendly against Hong Kong  scheduled to take place four days before the March 23 Asian Cup qualifier in Pyongyang  is unlikely because of visa problems. The Fifa A friendly was planned keeping in mind the away game against North Korea, but the AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco, contacted in New Delhi Saturday, said the match looks uncertain at this stage. The Hong Kong tie may be cancelled because visas for our players are yet to be arranged, he said. India will host North Korea in the return-leg match at Nehru Stadium in Margao on March 30. The Indian squad, currently training under chief coach Stephen Constantine in Margao, is expected to be named Sunday. Meanwhile, India will take on Turkmenistan in the pre-Olympic first-round qualifier. India will go to Ashkhabad for their away match on April 5 and host Turkmenistan in Goa on April 19.TODAY IN SPORT

 Gough a surprise inclusion
 - squad for ODIs vs Pakistan, tri-series London: Paceman Darren Gough was recalled to the England one-day squad on Thursday but selectors also opted for six uncapped players. Gough was a surprise inclusion among the 15 names to take on Pakistan in three one-day Internationals in June followed by a tri-series involving Zimbabwe and South Africa in June and July. He is a proven match-winner who was badly missed during the World Cup, chairman of selectors David Graveney said. The 32-year-old Gough has been out of the England side on a prolonged basis following a number of knee operations. Six uncapped players The six uncapped players at one-day international level are batsmen James Troughton, Robert Key and Anthony McGrath, fast bowlers Kabir Ali and Richard Johnson and allrounder Rikki Clarke. The new-look England side followed the retirement from one-dayers of several first-choice players, including former captain Nasser Hussain, who stepped down after the World Cup, Andy Caddick and Alec Stewart.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Parthiv appears set to keep in opener 
 - Decision after Kirmani-Wright-Dravid meeting today  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  If Parthiv keeps, Dravid will be able to focus on batting and captaincy in the tri-series New Delhi: Despite a below par performance in the Mohali Test, Parthiv Patel appears set to do the wicketkeepers job in Team Indias opening tri-series game, versus New Zealand in Chennai, on Thursday. The Indians, therefore, will then be reverting to the days of six batsmen and a specialist keeper, instead of fielding seven and getting Rahul Dravid  now the stand-in captain  to enact a double role. Except for the Dhaka tri-series (in April) when Dravid wasnt available, he kept in almost every match since the start of the 2001-2002 bilateral series in the West Indies. That allowed an extra batsman to be accommodated. According to The Telegraphs sources, with Parthiv keeping, Dravid will be able to focus wholly on the captaincy and his batting. In any case, he has always been saying that in the long run, a specialist must be made to wear the big gloves. Its not insignificant, perhaps, that chief selector Syed Kirmani has been consistent in speaking about doing away with stop-gap wicketkeepers. His argument is straightforward: If the (top) six batsmen cant do the needful, its unrealistic expecting the seventh to do so. Its another matter that regular captain Sourav Gangulys views are quite different. Dravid wasnt available for a comment, but a formal decision will only be taken once Kirmani, coach John Wright and the (stand-in) captain have had a tte--tte in Chennai on Wednesday. Of course, its not that Dravid hasnt kept as captain. He has done so twice  in Jodhpur and Vijayawada, against the West Indies, 11 months ago. Parthiv, the youngest-ever Test keeper (at 17-plus in Trent Bridge, last year), has so far kept in six ODIs  once in New Zealand (Queenstown) and on five occasions in Dhaka. Dravid has done the job 41 times  his debut was in Taunton (versus Sri Lanka) in the 1999 World Cup. Meanwhile, the selectors havent yet discussed naming a (stand-in) vice-captain. Usually, no appointment is made for engagements at home but, in a departure, Dravid was officially named Souravs deputy when the squad for the Motera Test was announced in Rajkot. Given that Virender Sehwag was Souravs vice-captain in Dhaka, its possible that he will be temporarily promoted.  Copyright

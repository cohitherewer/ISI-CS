 Young admits to positive test
 The Young issue could open a Pandoras Box London: US athlete Jerome Young, who won the 400m gold at the world championships this week, has admitted he failed a drug test in 1999, the Los Angeles Times reported on Friday. On Wednesday, the newspaper alleged Young had tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone in 1999, but had been subsequently cleared by the governing body of American athletics and allowed to compete at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. The newspapers website on Friday quoted Young as saying in an interview about the dope test: Its something that happened. Its all past, and its something I dont want to talk about. Not at all. Young won a gold medal in the 4x400m relay in Sydney, even though he did not race in the final. Referring to the test, he said: Its something thats a closed door. I dont think about it now. Im keeping focussed, dont let things distract me. On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee urged the world governing athletics body and the US federation to pursue the newspaper allegations about Young. The IOC asked US Olympic officials and the IAAF to investigate allegations that Young was allowed to compete in the Sydney Olympics despite a positive drug test. (Reuters)  Copyright

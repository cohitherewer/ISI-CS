The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A great win: Lara
St Johns: The West Indies world record chase and their three-wicket win over Australia in the final Test was a memorable day for Caribbean cricket. Today was a special effort by Omari and Drakes and its great for us to show the mettle and the character and come out with a great win against the world champions today, skipper Lara said. We have now set a standard and we kept the standard up and we made the greatest run chase in the history of the game and thats what we are going to take forward, Lara said. Steve Waugh praised the West Indies for an outstanding team performance. It was a great Test match, congratulations to the West Indies, it was an outstanding team win and to chase 400 is a magnificent performance and I take my hat off to them. (AFP)  Copyright

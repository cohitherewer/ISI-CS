		 Wednesday, March 12, 2003  Announcer may strike 
 BY STAR RACER Vijay Singhr				 										Calcutta: Although Announcer was made to sweat it out, in his last start, before the Vijay Singh-trainee could take the measure of Sky Command and Moon Mission, yet the Tecorno-Karishmas Pet son is fancied to win the Magnanimous Cup at the RCTC Wednesday. The four-year-old gelding is looking improved and he may beat his his main challengers  The Flying Star and Birds Empire.				 										The 1,200m Own Opinion Cup is the other trophy event in the seven-event card but the fancied runners may have to pray for a trouble-free galloping room in a 13-horse field. Nevertheless, on his last start impressive victory, Bold Apparel gets the first call. The Errol Bhungard-trainee may have faced a strong challenge from his owner-mate Terrificco had the trip been longer than the slated sprint. Amyn Merchant partners the horse.

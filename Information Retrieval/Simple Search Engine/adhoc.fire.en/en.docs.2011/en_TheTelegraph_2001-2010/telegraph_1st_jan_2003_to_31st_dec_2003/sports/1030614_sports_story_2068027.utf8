 Lancashire discard Harbhajan
 The Indian ace has failed a fitness test  London: In a sudden decision, English county  Lancashire Friday terminated its contract with Harbhajan  Singh after the off-spinner failed a fitness test Thursday.  The Indian superstar had sustained a finger injury  during the World Cup in South Africa which prevented him  from joining Lancashire at the start of the season.  Its disappointing that Harbhajan wont be joining  us, but at least a firm decision has been taken. We wish  him well for the future and trust that he will recover soon,  Lancashire cricket manager Mike Watkinson said. Carl Hooper,  who was taken in as replacement for Harbhajan, is likely  to continue till the end of the season.  (PTI)  Copyright

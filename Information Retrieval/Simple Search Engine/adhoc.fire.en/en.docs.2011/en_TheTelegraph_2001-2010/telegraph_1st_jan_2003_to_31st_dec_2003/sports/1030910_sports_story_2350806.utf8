 Latif not a cheat, says manager
Multan: Pakistan cricket manager Haroon Rasheed Tuesday rallied behind banned captain Rashid Latif insisting the disgraced skipper was not a cheat. The ICC Match Referee Mike Procter of South Africa banned Latif after Bangladesh lodged a complaint on a controversial catch during the third Test. The Pakistan captain caught Bangladesh batsman Alok Kapali on the third day of the third and final Test on Friday but television replays showed Latif dropped the ball while tumbling. Since the batsman walked and both umpires  Russell Tiffin of Zimbabwe and Asoka de Silva of Sri Lanka  were unsighted, the dismissal was not questioned. Bangladesh team manager M.A. Latif Khan reportedly accused Latif of unfair play and said the controversial catch denied his team of their first ever Test win  leading to his ban. But Rasheed was fuming over the suspension. Latif did not cheat and had he known the catch was not completed he would surely have called the batsman back, he said on Tuesday. We have in mind that Latif is honest and his previous record proves that he never indulged in any unfair play. I am amazed that after a decision by the Match Referee why the issue is discussed in public.  (AFP)  Copyright

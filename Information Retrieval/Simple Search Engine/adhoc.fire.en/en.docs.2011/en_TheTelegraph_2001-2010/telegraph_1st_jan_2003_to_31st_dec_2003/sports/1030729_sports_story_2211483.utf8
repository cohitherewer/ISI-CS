The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Yuvraj fails again
London: Yuvraj Singh failed to strike form in his debut County season, managing to score just 11 runs but was lucky to end up on the winning side as Yorkshire scored an 18-run victory over Kent in a National League tie in Scarborough on Sunday. Put in to bat, Yorkshire lost both their overseas batsmen, New Zealander Stephen Fleming and Yuvraj, and also Michael Lumb in a testing spell by Ben Trott. But neither Fleming nor Yuvraj were happy with the decisions. Chasing 198 for a win, Kent were bundled out for 179 in 43.5 overs with Vic Craven claiming four wickets for 28 runs.  (PTI)  Copyright

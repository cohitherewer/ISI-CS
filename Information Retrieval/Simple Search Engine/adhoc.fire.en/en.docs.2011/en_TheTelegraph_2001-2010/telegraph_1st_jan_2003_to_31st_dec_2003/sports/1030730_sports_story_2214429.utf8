The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA believe Nasser had totally lost it
 Steve is all praise for Hussain Birmingham: Nasser Hussain was accused of losing it and trying to embarrass South African captain Graeme Smith during his last match as England Test captain. Smith, 22, publicly expressed surprise at his opposite numbers move. But sources close to the tourists camp said that the Essex batsmans decision had not come as a total surprise. Nasser lost it totally, the source said. He was swearing at his players on the field. The source added that Hussain, whose players often felt the rough edge of his tongue tried to put one over on Smith just before the Test began last Thursday. When he went out to toss, Hussain introduced Smith to the Match Referee as Greg Smith. The (South Africa) team thought it was a deliberate attempt to humiliate him. However, Australian captain Steve Waugh, said he had always respected Hussain for his competitive spirit. Waugh said he enjoyed pitting wits with Hussain on the field. As an opposing captain he was always someone I respected, Waugh added. (Agencies)  Copyright

Bengal  Skipper Latif, coach Miandad back at helm
 Latif: Second stint Islamabad: In an expected shake-up following the teams first-round exit from the World Cup, Pakistan captain Waqar Younis was Wednesday sacked to be replaced by wicketkeeper Rashid Latif while former skipper Javed Miandad was brought back for his third stint as coach. In a major revamp, the PCB also named Yousuf Youhana as the vice-captain for the upcoming tri-nation series in Sharjah next month. Youhana replaces Inzamam-ul Haq who had quit the post after the Cup debacle. There were changes in the selection committee as well with another former captain Aamir Sohail appointed the new chief selector in place of Wasim Bari, who had requested to be relieved from his post, a PCB release said. Sohail would head a new committee comprising Shafiq Ahmed, Salim Yousuf, Farrukh Zaman and Shoaib Mohammed. The changes were widely expected after Pakistan made an ignominious exit in their worst performance in the World Cup since 1975. Latif, 34, returns as captain after more than four years. He had an earlier stint at the helm in 1997-98. Latif, a veteran of 34 Tests and 149 one-dayers, was expected to retire after this World Cup but put off his plans after getting a wind of his new post. Like Latif, Miandad also returns to a familiar territory. He was coach of the team in 1998 and 2000 before being forced to quit following players rebellion over sharing of prize money. He replaces South Africa-based Englishman Richard Pybus who quit after the teams ouster. Latif will be Pakistans seventh captain and Miandad the 11th coach in a period of five years. Upset with the teams performance in South Africa, Miandad had expressed his desire to meet Pakistan President Gen. Pervez Musharraf to discuss the restructuring of the game in the country. Haroon Rashid was appointed the new manager replacing Shahryar Khan.  Major revamp hinted Meanwhile, Latif hinted there would be a major revamp in the team, saying some of the senior members would be dropped. He also urged the fans to be patient with the team during the rebuilding process. The nation must remain tolerant and should not expect overnight results from the new-look Pakistan team, Latif said. The team failed in the World Cup due to poor batting, bowling and fielding efforts. My goal is to remove the deficiencies, he added. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Scots awaiting Dravid boost
London, April 26 (AFP): Scotland are confident that Indian batsman Rahul Dravid will be playing for them by June 1, the team skipper said Saturday. The Scots, who will be competing in the National League this season along with English Counties, are depending on Dravid. They open against Durham on May 4 and hope that their Indian import, who has plenty of experience of English conditions having played for Kent, will be available to play in the game against Hampshire on June 1. We are still waiting for Dravid to sign up, but talks are at an advanced stage, skipper Craig Wright told the BBC. I would rather have him for part of the season than not at all.  Kaif set for Derby Our Special Correspondent in Calcutta adds: Mohammed Kaif is all set to turn out for Derbyshire from early June. That he was being considered by the County was reported by The Telegraph a few days ago. According to information received here, Kaif will be replacing Shahid Afridi. The Countys other overseas pro is Michael Di Venuto.  Copyright

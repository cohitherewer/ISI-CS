 Zurbaran strikes 
  BY TITAN BOY PadmanabhanZurbaran Zurbaran fought his way to the Indian Turf Invitation Cup victory at the Hyderabad Sunday but his win on the day was much on the cards. The S. Padmanabhan-trainee had meekly surrendered to Noble Eagle who, in the Indian Derby three Sundays ago, had led from the start and tricked Zurbaran to a defeat. It was a lesson that had prompted all those close to the Peaks And Valleys-Cut of The Cloth colt to re-draw a strategy to counter Eagles challenge. And, it worked. The Eagle, on the day, was never allowed the luxury of long lead at any stage of the 2,400m trip as his jockey M. Dwyer preferred to breath down Eagles neck until he brought his ride abreast of the leader 450m from home.Named after a 17th century Spanish painter, Francisco de Zurbaran, who was known for his direct and ruthless realism, Zurbaran appears to have inherited all those qualities. Once in the lead, he not only destroyed his Indian Derby conqueror but also the rest of 14 in the line-up. Zurbaran was painter to the king, and he was king of painters, was the remark once made by king Phillip IV. It is now for Padmanabhan how to re-phrase these words.The entire Zurbaran contingent was ecstatic about the courageous victory of the horse. It was a great win. Im doubly delighted as he is bred by me, said Khusru N. Dhunjibhoy, chairman RWITC, and the part-horseowner for whom it was his first ever Invitation Cup victory. Byram Jeejeebhoy, also a part-owner, felt the same. Zurbaran, however, also has a little bit of connection with the city of joy. Dhunjibhoys wife Deepa hails from the city and so does Sharmila, wife of Padmanabhan.RESULTS(With inter-state dividends)1.

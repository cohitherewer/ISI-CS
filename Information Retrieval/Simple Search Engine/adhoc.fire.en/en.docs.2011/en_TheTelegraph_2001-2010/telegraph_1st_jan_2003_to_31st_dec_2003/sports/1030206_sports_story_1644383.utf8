 Media takes on ICC
 Brussels: The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) Wednesday attacked cricket chiefs for insisting Zimbabwe was safe for reporters to cover the World Cup. The press campaign group also lobbied Rupert Murdoch to lift cash penalties linked to tournament television rights which the IFJ said were placing money above safety. Zimbabwe is anything but a safe venue for journalists, IFJ general secretary Aidan White said in a letter to Malcolm Speed, the ICC chief executive. Over the past two years we have seen numerous acts of violence against media, a wholesale legal assault on independent journalism and the creation of an atmosphere of intimidation, White said.

 Suspension a blessing, feels Warne
 Shane Warne poses with a fan during a promotional event in Sydney on Friday. (AP) Sydney: Disgraced cricketer Shane Warne believes his 12-month suspension for doping could end up working in his favour by extending his career.The Australian leg-spinner said the suspension had allowed him to get fitter than ever while regaining his motivation to continue playing at the top level.I think itll actually help me in the long run, Warne said on Friday at a reunion of Australias Test cricketers. I think Ive got two or three years left in the game and the enforced layoff is probably going to help me add another one at the end of my career.Warne, who was banned from playing for a year after testing positive for banned diuretics just before the World Cup, said he had taken a break from bowling to give his shoulder a rest after years of wear and tear but was working hard on his general fitness.Im as fit as Ive ever been, he said. Ive been working hard at the gym and running and Im ready to go but theres no use peaking in August when Ive still got six or seven months to go.I just have to look after myself and present myself the best way I can in February.

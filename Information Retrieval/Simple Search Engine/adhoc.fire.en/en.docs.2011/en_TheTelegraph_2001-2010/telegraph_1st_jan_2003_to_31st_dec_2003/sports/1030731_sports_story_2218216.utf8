The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India slip two slots
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: While East Bengal bask in the glory of their ASEAN Club Championship triumph and look favourites to clinch the AFCs best club award for this month, India continue to go down the ladder in world football. The latest Fifa world ranking, published on Wednesday, says India are now ranked at 131  a couple of notches down from their June rank. India were at 127 in December last year. This means the Stephen Constantine-managed side once again failed to figure in Asias top twenty nations. North Korea are 20th in Asia and 119th in the world. India are 22nd among the Asian nations, seven points behind Lebanon. Japan are atop Asia, 24th in the world, followed by South Korea, 27th in the world. Meanwhile, Mexico soared to fifth after they won the CONCACAF Gold Cup, Reuters adds from Zurich. FIFAS TOP 10 1. Brazil 848 points 2. France 824 3. Spain 755 4. The Netherlands 750 5. Mexico 749 6.

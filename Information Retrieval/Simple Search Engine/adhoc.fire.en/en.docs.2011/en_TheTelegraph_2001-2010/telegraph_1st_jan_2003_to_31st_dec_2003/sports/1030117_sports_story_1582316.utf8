		 Friday, January 17, 2003 				 ICC warning for Lanka board
																								London: The ICC has warned Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) that it must return completed World Cup player contracts by Friday or face serious consequences.																								The IDI (ICCs marketing arm) confirmed Thursday that it is expecting to receive the signed Player Terms from the BCCSL Friday, said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed in a statement.																								We have been in regular contact with the BCCSL and expect to receive the signed Player Terms on Friday, he added.																								Failure to return the contracts will have very serious consequences for the BCCSL.																								The player contracts were supposed to have been delivered to the ICC two days ago. Earlier, a website reported the Sri Lankans had refused to sign their contracts because of an argument about payments. The website said a statement from the Sri Lanka Cricketers Association (SLCA) said: The SLCA confirms that the controversial Player Terms agreement has not been signed by the Lankan cricketers.																								The Association said it was demanding the BCCSL paid their players 20 per cent of the revenue they receive from the World Cup instead of the offered five.																								The players of Australia and New Zealand are being paid 25 per cent...the South Africans are almost there with 30 per cent of the total money received from their board, it added. (REUTERS)

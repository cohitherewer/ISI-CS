 Veterans keen to play
New Delhi: Encouraged by the peace overtures between New Delhi and Islamabad, the Board of Veteran Cricket in India (BVCI) on Wednesday said it was keen to undertake a tour of Pakistan to play a one-day series. We are planning to propose to the sports ministry to give us permission to play against Pakistan veterans in a one-day series, BVCI president Chetan Chauhan said on Wednesday. Chauhan conceded that such a series would depend on overall normalisation of relations between the two sides. The former cricketer was also hopeful that the veterans tournament would lead to the national cricket teams of both countries resuming their ties. Chauhan also favoured merger of the newly formed Indian Cricket Players Association (ICPA) and now-defunct Association of Indian cricketers (AIC). What we need now is a strong association to protect the interest of players. What is going on now is not good for anyone. In the better interest of players and the game, these two bodies should be merged, Chauhan said. Chauhan said he will talk with some former players including ICPA president Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, secretary Arun Lal and ACI president Kapil Dev over the issue. (PTI)  Copyright

 Coe backs Indias bid
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Oct. 25: Legendary British athlete Sebastian Coe gave full marks to India for its capacity to organise multi-discipline sporting events. You have all that you need to organise any sporting event in the world, Coe, who was in Hyderabad in connection with the Afro-Asian Games opening ceremony, was quoted as saying in a media release from the organisers. Coe said India was a strong contender for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. There is no reason why the Commonwealth Games should remain in Britain, Canada or New Zealand, he said. I am told Delhi has good infrastructure and a rich sporting tradition to successfully organise the Games, Coe said. PTI adds from Hyderabad: An African nation will host the second edition of the Afro-Asian Games in 2007, the Games Council announced here Saturday.  Copyright

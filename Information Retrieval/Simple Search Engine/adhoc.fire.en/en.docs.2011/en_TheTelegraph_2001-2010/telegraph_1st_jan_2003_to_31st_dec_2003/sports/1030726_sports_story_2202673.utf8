 Digvijay in 3-way lead
Srinagar: Defending champion Digvijay Singh shot a brilliant five-under third round at the Kashmir Open on Friday. Digvijays 67 took him to a three-day tally of nine-under 207, on a par with Mukesh Kumar and Pappan both of whom carded a three-under 69 to climb from overnight joint second to the top of the leaderboard. Overnight leader Arjun Singh had a disappointing round of one-over 73 which saw him slip to joint fourth, alongside Asias best golfer Jyoti Randhawa who struck a two-under 70. The days best card came from Sri Lankas Anura Rohana, who equalled the tournament-record six-under 66 to climb to sixth from his overnight 14. Harmeet Kahlon hit a two-under 70 and was at seventh spot, followed by Uttam Singh Mundy who returned a par card.  (PTI)  Copyright

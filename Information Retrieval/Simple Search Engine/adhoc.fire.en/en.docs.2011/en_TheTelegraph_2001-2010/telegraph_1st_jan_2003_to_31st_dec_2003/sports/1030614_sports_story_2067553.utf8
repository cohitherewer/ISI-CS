The Telegraph - Calcutta
 N. Korean coach SAI-bound
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The Table Tennis Federation of India will have another North Korean coach for the SAIs Centre for Excellence in Salt Lake. Earlier, North Korean Kim Chang Ho was in charge, but he had to leave with heart ailments. The TTFI president Mool Chand Chowhan said that they had asked for a coach from the North Korean federation. We have got a positive reply from them, though they havent sent a name yet, Chowhan said. The TTFI had selected a Chinese coach earlier for the Centre for Excellence, but he was not given the permission by the government following the outbreak of SARS. Chowhan further added that a Yugoslav coach will be in charge of the national team. Actually, we want coaches who can spend enough time with the boys. The Indian coaches are not always in a position to do that, Chowhan maintained. The president informed that handing the national teams charge over to a foreign coach has been chalked out keeping in mind the upcoming tournaments of Commonwealth table tennis meet, the Asian championship and the Asian Games. Meanwhile, another Chinese coach will be in charge of the Petroleum Sports Control Board-run academy in Patiala.  Copyright

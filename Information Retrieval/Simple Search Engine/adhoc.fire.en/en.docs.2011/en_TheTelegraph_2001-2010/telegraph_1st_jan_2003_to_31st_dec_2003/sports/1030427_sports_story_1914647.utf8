The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Crunch tie for Md. Sp. today
 FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi, April 26: While he watched State Bank of Travancore (SBT) rally back from a two-goal deficit to beat Air India 4-2 in the second division National Football League final phase here Saturday, Mohammedan Sporting coach Mohammed Habeebs brows were furrowed. While Air India were doomed, Habbebs worry was that his team plays Haywards 2000 Sporting Clube de Goa Sunday. Habeeb says this could be his most important match of the season. The duel is between Sporting Clubes in-form striker Dudu Omagbemi and Mohammedan Sportings Ghanaian central defender Yaro Ishau. Habeeb realises that Omagbemi, with his close control and mobility, is the danger man. So Yaro and skipper Hussein Mustafi will closely mark him. Mohammedan Sporting have no injury problems. Reazul Mustafa may get a look-in. A victory will almost cement a berth in the NFL next season. Good victory for SBT SBT scored through M. A. Abdul Hakeem, K. M. Abdul Naushad and a brace by S. Ignatious. With four goals from two matches Igantious is the top-scorer of the round robin league so far. Earlier Air India scored through strikers Anthony Fernandes and Suprith Jathanna. This defeat has doomed Air India to another season in the second division. Having lost both their matches they are out of contention for the top two qualifiers for the premier division of the NFL next season.  Copyright

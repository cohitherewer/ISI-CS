The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Aussies cruise to 8-wkt win
Cairns, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Mano of the Match Brett Lee claimed four for 25 to help Australia claim an eight-wicket win in the first ODI against Bangladesh on Saturday. The tourists were skittled out for 105 in 34 overs. Opener Matthew Hayden, who made an unbeaten 46, dominated a 74-run stand for the second wicket with captain Ricky Ponting (29) as Australia reached 107 for two in 22.3 overs. Young fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza struck for Bangladesh when he had Adam Gilchrist caught by substitute wicketkeeper Sarkar for 18 with the Australian reply on 29. Resuming after lunch at 43 for one off nine overs, Hayden and Ponting were coasting before the skipper was bowled by left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique, attempting to hit the winning runs. Hayden lifted Mahmud over mid-wicket in the next over to end the match.  Copyright

 Barua starts with loss
Edinburgh: GM Dibyendu Barua suffered a shock defeat against IM Adam Hunt of England in the first round of the British Chess Championship on Tuesday. Other Indian GMs had to work hard too with Surya Sekhar Ganguly managing a draw against Simon Williams of England, while P. Harikrishna salvaged a hard-fought win over Craig Hanley, also of England. GM Abhijit Kunte had an easier outing, against Steve Mannion of Scotland and Tejas Bakre defeated Andrew Greet of England. IMs Neelotpal Das and S. Kidambi also registered victories, against Andrew Muir of Scotland and Ameet Ghasi of England, respectively. The Indian women had a mixed round. Stealing the show was Swati Ghate, who defeated WGM and Commonwealth womens champion S. Vijayalakshmi in an absorbing contest. IWMs Nisha Mohota and S. Meenakshi lost to John Shaw and Daniel Gormally, respectively. WGM Aarthie Ramaswamy drew with IM Reefat Bin Sattar of Bangladesh, but Eesha Karavade went down fighting to David Eggleston of England.

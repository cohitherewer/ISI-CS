  Englands Nick Faldo celebrates a point at the Heineken Classic in Melbourne Saturday. (AFP) Melbourne, Feb. 1 (Reuters): Six-time major winner Nick Faldo gave himself 11 out of 10 after shooting a third round seven-under-par 65 on Saturday to take a one-stroke lead in the Heineken Classic. The 45-year-old Briton, who has not won a tournament since the 1997 Nissan Open on the US Tour, has a three-round total of 11-under-par 205 to lead three players by one shot including fellow Englishman Paul Casey. Casey, the overnight leader, had a two-over-par 74 including a double-bogey on the par-four 13th hole after earlier rounds of 65 and 67. Australias Peter Lonard and Swedens Niclas Fasth were also one stroke behind the rejuvenated Faldo. World No. 2 and Heineken Classic defending champion Ernie Els and New Zealands David Smail are next on eight under.

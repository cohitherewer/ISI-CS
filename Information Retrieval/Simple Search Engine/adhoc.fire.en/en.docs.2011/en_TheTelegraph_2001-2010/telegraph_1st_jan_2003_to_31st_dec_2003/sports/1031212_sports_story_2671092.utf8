The Telegraph - Calcutta
 2003 was a Belgian affair
London: Tennis balance of power see-sawed dramatically in 2003 before settling firmly on the side of Belgium and youth. A schizophrenic 12 months began with a Serena Slam and the 32-year-old Andre Agassi becoming the oldest mens Grand Slam champion for three decades in Australia. It finished with Belgians Justine Henin-Hardenne and Kim Clijsters dominating the womens game and Andy Roddick heading a new generation of mens pretenders to replace the departed Pete Sampras. The Williams sisters year was tinged with misfortune, controversy and tragedy. Serenas victory at the Australian Open meant she became the fifth woman to hold all four Grand Slam singles titles simultaneously. But that was as good as it got. Her tantrum at the French Open in June, when she was goaded by an unsporting crowd and later accused her semi-final conqueror Henin of lying and fabricating, left a sour taste. Serena had a subdued victory over injury-stricken older sister Venus in the Wimbledon final a month later. Venus did not play again and a nagging knee injury curtailed Serenas season and cost her the No. 1 ranking. In an awful end to a difficult year, their elder sister Yetunde was shot dead in Los Angeles in September. Next season will prove a severe test of both their resilience and appetite. Henin and Clijsters, previously unable to compete with the Williams power, saw their chance and grabbed it. With her steely resolve and beautiful technique, Henin added the US Open crown to the French Open title, showing a ruthless streak to beat the more powerful but seemingly over-awed Clijsters in each final. The Belgian pair quickly ousted Serena from the top of the rankings, finishing one and two, respectively. Belgian tennis is still pinching itself. So too is American Andy Roddick after ending the year with his maiden Grand Slam success at the US Open in September and the No. 1 ranking. To some the 21-year-old Roddick is brash, to others he is a breath of fresh air. But his recruitment of the streetwise Brad Gilbert as coach was a masterstroke and few opponents can now cope with the all-court game and will to win of Sampras natural heir.One player who proved he could live with Roddick was Roger Federer who also secured his maiden Grand Slam.

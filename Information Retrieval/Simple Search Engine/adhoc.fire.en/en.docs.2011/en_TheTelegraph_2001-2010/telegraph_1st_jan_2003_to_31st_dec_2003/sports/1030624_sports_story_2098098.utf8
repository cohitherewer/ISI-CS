 Rain halts Lara short of century
 Brian Lara cuts one in St Lucia Sunday. (AFP) Gros Islet (St Lucia): Heavy rain halted play on the third day of the first Test between the West Indies and Sri Lanka Sunday with the home side on 272 for four in reply to the tourists first innings of 354. No play was possible in the first session of Day IV owing to waterlogging in the playing area. Brian Lara was seven short of a century when play was stopped eight overs after the lunch break, with Marlon Samuels on five, as was reported in Mondays Late City edition. Off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan claimed Ramnaresh Sarwans wicket in the afternoon session before the rain intervened. Sarwan (7) tried a pull shot, but the ball ballooned off the boot of short fine-leg Kumar Sangakkara and Marvan Atapattu took the catch. Video replays, however, suggested the ball had hit the ground before making contact with Sangakkaras foot. Wavell Hinds struck a solid 113 in the morning before being the victim of a mix-up with Lara that gave Atapattu an easy run-out opportunity for Sri Lanka. The third-wicket stand of 174 between Hinds and Lara had put the West Indies on top after the home side began the day on 161 for two. It was a nice feeling to score a century again for the West Indies, said Hinds, who had been out of favour with the West Indies selectors but was recalled for the Sri Lanka series when Shivnarine Chanderpaul was ruled out with a broken finger. Obviously its all in the cause of helping the team get into a winning position, the left-hander added. (Reuters)  Copyright

 Raducan retires 
Bucharest: Romanias pixie gymnast Andreea Raducan officially retired Sunday from gymnastics after a career in which she was stripped of her Olympic gold medal for taking an over-the-counter cold medicine. In a ceremony held during the national gymnastics championships in the northeast city of Bacau, Raducan, 19, bid goodbye to her fans and vowed to continue to support the womens gymnastics team. It was time I did this, an emotional Raducan said. This chapter of my life is over... With its good and less good moments, but another is just beginning. Raducan last competed in November, but after gaining weight and performing poorly at the world championships in Hungary and the World Cup in Germany, she announced she was quitting gymnastics in January. Raducan won three golds at the 2001 world championships, and helped Romania win world titles in 1999 and 2001, and the 2000 Olympics team gold in Sydney. Raducan later went into business, launching a flour brand bearing her name. (AP)  Copyright

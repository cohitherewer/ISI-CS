 Dempo rout HAL 
Bangalore: Dempo Sports Club, Goa trounced Bangalores Hindustan Aeronautics Limited 4-1 in a one-sided match in their 7th Oil PSU National Football League match here on Tuesday. Dempo, who led 2-0 at half time took their points tally to 32, while HAL, facing relegation to the second division remained at eight points after 21 matches. Playing a fast paced but controlled game, Dempo opened their account in the 15th minute when Bijen Singh scored off a pass from Lazarus Fernandes. Jose Lucianos header off a cross from Clifford found the net in the 38th minute and Dempo led 2-0. Fernandes struck again in the 83rd minute effortlessly deceiving HAL custodian Mark Mascarenhas. Substitute Levy Coelho sealed rounded off Dempos tally in the last minute. The only solace for the local team came during the 51st minute when Dayanand converted a penalty kick. Meanwhile, with their heads high after two wins, Churchill Brothers are determined to put it across a depleted Mahindra United when they lock horns at Maragos Nehru Stadium Wednesday. Churchills Nascimento Silveira will have to sit out due to a double booking, while Syed Hussain will replace Peter Siddique. (PTI)  Copyright

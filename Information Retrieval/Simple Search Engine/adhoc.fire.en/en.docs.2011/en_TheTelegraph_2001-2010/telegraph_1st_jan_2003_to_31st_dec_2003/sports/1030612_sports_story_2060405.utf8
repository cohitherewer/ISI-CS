The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sambaran quits as coach
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Sambaran Banerjee feels Bengal will do well this season Calcutta: Bengal coach Sambaran Banerjee sought release from his post on Wednesday after a meeting with the Cricket Association of Bengal president Jagmohan Dalmiya. Sambaran, who was appointed coach last season said he would be too busy with his own academy. I told the president to release me for the time being. However, I would be available for Bengal in any capacity after a year, he said. The former coach added that he has a got a new sponsor for his academy and it has become essential for him to devote more time to it. It wouldnt have been possible had I been in charge of Bengal. Bengal, on the other hand, werent too keen to retain him after their dismal show in the Ranji Trophy last season, which they finished with only three points. Assessing the team, Sambaran said: I think there is a lot of potential. We took a little time in getting used to the new Ranji Trophy format. He felt that the team would do quite well this season, irrespective of whoever is in charge. However, the opening slot remains a bit of a worry. Except for one game, our openers could never cross the 50-mark, he added. Incidentally, Sambaran led Bengal to Ranji Trophy triumph in 1989-90.  Copyright

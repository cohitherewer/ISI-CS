 Chandana gives Lanka series
- SECOND ODI - Laras ton undone by sloppy fielding as visitors overhaul 312 Upul Chandana pulls one en route to his career-best 89 at the Kensington Oval Sunday. (AFP) Bridgetown: Upul Chandana ruined Brian Laras party with a rapid 89 as Sri Lanka stunned the West Indies by four wickets in the second one-dayer to gain a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series Sunday.Lara hit an explosive 116 to help his team post 312, but Chandanas charge and some sloppy fielding helped Sri Lanka achieve the target with three balls to spare.Chandana, 31, turned the match on its head with his career-best knock as Sri Lanka successfully chased the sixth-highest total in the history of ODIs.The allrounder smashed four sixes and six fours to eventually upstage Lara.He played a great knock, said Sri Lankan captain Maravan Atapattu. We knew he had a lot of potential, but he had not lived up to it. He has now shown he can play a really good innings.			Sri Lanka had won the opening game at the same venue Saturday when they defended 201 by bowling out the hosts for 146.The visitors were off to a flying start as Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana shared a 71-run stand. The openers fell in quick succession, before Sri Lanka steadied the ship through another useful partnership between Atapattu and Kumar Sangakkara.But the match took a decisive turn when Chandana came in to bat at No. 5  ahead of Mahela Jayawardene and Tillekeratne Dilshan. Chandana put on 101 for the fifth wicket with Jayawardene and with the home team fielders letting go of numerous chances, Sri Lanka reached the target.Ryan Hurley and David Bernard both dropped Chandana in the outfield in the 47th over before he was finally caught at mid-wicket off Collymore. The West Indies batting flourished as Lara, Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels dominated the Sri Lankan attack. Lara was on song as he led the run riot to help his team reach the highest total at this venue.He paced his innings well after surviving a confident caught-behind appeal on nought, smashing two sixes and eight fours in his 106-ball knock for his 17th ODI century.Gayle struck two sixes and 12 fours to put his team on course for a big total with a 137-run stand with Lara. The stand equalled the West Indies best for the second wicket against Sri Lanka.Lankan Test squadChandana has been left out of the squad for the two-Test series, adds PTI from Colombo.Chandana returns home with middle order batsman Naveed Nawaz.

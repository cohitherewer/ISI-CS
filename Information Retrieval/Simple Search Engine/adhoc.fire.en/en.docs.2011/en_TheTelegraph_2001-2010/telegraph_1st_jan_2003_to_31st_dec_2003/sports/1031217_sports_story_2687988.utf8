The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Elation in city cricket circle
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Accolades have been pouring in from all parts of the world for Sourav Ganguly and his team. The Telegraph spoke to a few city-based Test cricketers to gauge their mood. ARUN LAL: Its almost a miracle. I just cant believe that the team came back to win the Test after conceding 556 in the first innings and being reduced to 81 for four in the first innings. Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Ajit Agarkar each one had their role to play. Its a result of teamwork. Sachin Tendulkars two wickets in the second innings proved to be the turning point. And of course, Sourav Gangulys marshalling of resources and the team spirit... DEVANG GANDHI: The team has shown the determination to succeed. What has made the difference is the attitude and skill of the players  the batsmen, for example, have dared to pull and cut the bowling to shreds. The strong mental approach has created an impact on the players. The top six batsmen have delivered and the team has been peaking at the right time. So theres reason to be optimistic. ERAPALLI PRASANNA: Full marks to Sourav and his boys. Indias first innings score of 523 in reply to the Aussies 556 was the turning point of the match. Kumble picked up five wickets in the first innings and provided excellent support to Agarkar in the second. If you go by past records, spinners have always been successful in Melbourne and Sydney. It would hence be wise to play two spinners  Murali Kartik along with Kumble since Harbhajan Singh is unfit. That way we stand a good chance of winning once more. PRANAB ROY: The team has performed as a unit and that has made the difference. Souravs handling of his resources has also been encouraging. Consistency will be a big factor now and the team has it in them to keep the good times going. The players cannot afford to be complacent in the next two Tests and there should be not let up in the aggressive approach. We always knew that Andy Bichel and Brad Williams were not in the same league as Glenn McGrath or Brett Lee. If the players could adjust to the conditions quickly, we were in with a chance. Thats what has exactly happened. SYED SABA KARIM: All credit to the players. It proves that you shouldnt stop losing hope. It has been possible because of the players belief in their abilities. I never doubted the teams batting capabilities but had my doubts on the bowling. More specifically, if the bowlers had the firepower to bowl the Aussies out twice in a game. Anil Kumble and Agarkar have proved me wrong.  Copyright

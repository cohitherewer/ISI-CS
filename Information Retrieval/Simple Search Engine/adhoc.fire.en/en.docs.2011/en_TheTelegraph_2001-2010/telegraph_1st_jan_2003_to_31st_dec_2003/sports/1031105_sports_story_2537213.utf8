The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pathan scalps 9 including hattrick 
 Irfan Pathans devastating performance floored Bangladesh Islamabad: Irfan Pathan produced a devastating spell of fast bowling to capture nine wickets including a hattrick as India demolished Bangladesh by an emphatic 189 runs in the Asian under-19 meet in Lahore on Tuesday. After India were all out for 223 in 48.4 overs, the Baroda speedster virtually ran through the Bangladeshi innings, returning with dream figures of nine for 16 to give India their second successive victory. By dint of Tuesdays win, India stormed into the final where they will take on Sri Lanka on Thursday. In Karachi, Sri Lanka outclassed hosts Pakistan by 14 runs in another match on Tuesday. Bangladesh were bundled out for a paltry 34 in 14.5 overs as Pathan proved too hot for their continental minnows in a totally one-sided contest. Sunny Singh was the other wicket-taker, returning with one for 17 in seven overs. Pathan, who got in to his wicket-taking business as soon as Bangladesh batsmen started their chase, claimed his first scalp in the second ball of the innings inducing an edge from opener Naeem Islam to wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik. Thereafter, Man-of-the-Match Pathan made the day miserable for the Bangladeshis as he kept on taking wickets at regular intervals and even did not allow any batsman to reach double figures. Captain Nafis Iqbal was the top-scorer with nine while Bangladesh accumulated 10 runs through extras. Five batsmen failed to open their account. Pathans hattrick came in the last over of the day when he dismissed Sagir Hossain (5) Ziaur Rahman (0) and Shahadat Hossain (0) to cap his brilliant performance. Earlier, India recovered from four for 40 to post a healthy score with valuable contributions from Karthik and S. Raina (47). Pathan also came good with the bat making a solid 34 from just 31 balls with the help of four boundaries and a six. This was Indias second win in the competition after they beat Pakistan by 10 runs in a league match earlier. They, however, lost their first game against Sri Lanka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, April 19, 2003  Another resignation at RCTC 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: Rajan Mehrotra, general manager racing, RCTC, resigned on late Thursday evening. His resignation followed Vineet Verma quitting as CEO and secretary earlier on the same day. Mehrotra, however, said that his quitting of the turf club has nothing to do with the resignation of the CEO. Ive resigned for personal reasons and the Stewards have accepted my resignation, said Mehrotra. He will leave the club on July 1. 				 										The senior most official in the club, Mehrotra, 57, had joined RCTC as the handicapper in 1974 after a brief stint with the Delhi Race Club. Fairly consistent in awarding weights and slapping penalties, Mehrotra had always been popular among horseowners and professionals. However, the dwindling quality of horseflesh and the overall standards of the present strength of professionals prompted him to remark: Horseracing in RCTC was at its best in the 80s and in the early part of the 90s.

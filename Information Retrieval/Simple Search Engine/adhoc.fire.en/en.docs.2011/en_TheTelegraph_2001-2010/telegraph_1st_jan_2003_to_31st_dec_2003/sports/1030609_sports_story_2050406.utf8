The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lleyton Hewitts coach quits, says report
Sydney: Lleyton Hewitts coach Jason Stoltenberg has reportedly quit, throwing the world no. 1s Wimbledon defence into a spin. Sydneys Daily Telegraph reported that Stoltenberg has decided to return to Melbourne to spend more time with his wife and two children. For me its time to move on, Stoltenberg was quoted as saying. I believe Lleyton is poised to defend his Wimbledon title, which I know he holds so dear. Its been a pleasure and honour to have worked with Lleyton for the past 18 months. Stoltenberg replaced Darren Cahill as Hewitts coach after the Australian became the youngest year-end no. 1 in tennis professional era in November 2001. Cahill later teamed up with Andre Agassi. Roger Rasheed, who has known Hewitt since he was a teenager, will take over from Stoltenberg. Jasons been great for my game. Its a lifestyle decision and I respect that, Hewitt said.

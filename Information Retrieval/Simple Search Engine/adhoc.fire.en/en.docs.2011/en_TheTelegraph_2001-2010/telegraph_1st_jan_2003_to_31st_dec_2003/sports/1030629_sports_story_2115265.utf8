The Telegraph - Calcutta
 6-wkt win for England
 Kallis dedicated Saturdays 107 to his father, who has been diagnosed with cancer London, June 28 (Reuters): Vikram Solanki and Marcus Trescothick scored high-class one-day centuries to ruin Jacques Kallis day as England beat South Africa by six wickets on Saturday. Kallis 107 out of a team total of 264 for six on a fine batting track looked to have set up a certain South African victory in their triangular series encounter at The Oval. But Solanki, with a maiden run-a-ball century and the innings of his life, and Trescothick put on an England record of 200 for the first wicket in 32 overs to all but settle the issue. The South Africans gave England, led by Trescothick after Michael Vaughan suffered back spasms during the warm-up, a late scare with three wickets for three runs. But big-hitting all rounder Andrew Flintoff clobbered 32 off 21 balls, including three fours and two sixes, to ease their nerves as the home side reached 265 for four with 4.1 overs left.  Copyright

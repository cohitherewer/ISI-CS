 Warnes kiss that failed to make up
 Shane Warne Sydney: Another lurid episode of the Shane Warne soap opera unfolded on Wednesday when a court heard a statement by a girl who has accused the leg-spinner of kissing her in an inappropriate manner. The statement by Aleasha Black was heard as her uncle, Gold Coast businessman Christopher Kent, was contesting allegations he tried to blackmail Cricket Australia for $5000 after the alleged kiss. Aleasha took the stands briefly at the Melbourne magistrates court to confirm her statement and recount her encounter last year with Warne and Brett Lee. She described how she was cruising with friends in the Southport area when they saw a small crowd clustered around an Audi convertible with Warne and Lee inside. Soon after, Aleasha and her friends drove alongside the cricketers and Warne asked them to follow his car. When both cars pulled up at a nearby hotel, the cricketer beckoned Aleasha to approach his car. She introduced herself and the pair chatted before Warne said he had to return to Brisbane but wanted to see her again and asked for her phone number. At this time I asked Shane if I could get a kiss goodnight. Aleasha then put her head into the car and presented her left cheek, expecting a kiss on the cheek, the court heard. As I did this Shane grabbed the side of my face and stuck his tongue down my throat. I did kiss him back but this only lasted for about 30 seconds until I eventually pulled away, she said. As the teenager moved away from the car, Warne allegedly said: Show us your t***, come on give us a look.  Affecting games image Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) admitted that the scandal involving the South African woman was affecting the image of the game. After attempting to wash its hands off the whole affair as a personal matter between those involved  Warne and Helen Cohen Alon  CAs chief executive James Sutherland had to admit that the negative press generated by the text sex scandal was detrimental to cricket.  The simple answer is yes, it  affects the image of the game, Sutherland told the Sydney  Morning Herald. Sutherland said he has had a chat with  Warne on the issue but declined to divulge anything.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McCaw all praise for India
New Delhi: South African trainer Allistair McCaw, a strong contender to take up Adrian le Rouxs place, rated India as a better-skilled team than Australia or South Africa. He feels if the Indians improve their fitness and mental toughness, they will be the toughest to beat in the international arena. India would be the best team in the world if they approach their fitness and fielding with the same passion and intensity as they do while batting and bowling, McCaw said over the phone. The South Africans and Australians are no where as skilled as the Indians. But they make that up with their high fitness levels and a never-say-lose attitude, he said. McCaw had warned the Dutch team to look out for Indians even before the World Cup started. I said to the Dutch guys to Watch the Indians. They have been working on their fitness and add that to their incredible cricketing skills  they will be the finalists if not the world champions. He was the trainer of the Dutch side during the World Cup. McCaw, who is also the personal trainer of South African skipper Grame Smith, sought to dispel the notion that he may be ill-equipped to deal with specific fitness requirements of Indian cricketers. He, however, didnt go into the details of his possible contract with the BCCI, but added he has been approached. I am not in a position to comment on the issue. I also need to look into certain areas and discuss terms with the Holland Cricket Board, who would not be happy to see me go after the difference in fitness level they saw at the World Cup.

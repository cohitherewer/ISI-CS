 Pakistan ask ACC for postponement
Islamabad: Pakistan have requested the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) alter the schedule for the four-nation under-19 tournament involving India because it clashes with major cricket events to be hosted by the country, PCB chief Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia said Tuesday. We welcome Indias participation in the event as the first step towards resuming cricketing ties but want the event to be rescheduled from September to November this year, he said. Pakistan is due to host the senior teams from Bangladesh, South Africa and New Zealand in a hectic home season from August to November this year. The under-19 event will be overshadowed during this period, thats why we have asked the ACC to reschedule the event, Zia said. The quadrangular meet also features Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

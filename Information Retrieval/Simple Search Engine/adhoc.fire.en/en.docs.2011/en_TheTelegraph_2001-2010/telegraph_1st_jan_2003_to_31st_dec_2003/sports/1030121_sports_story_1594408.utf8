				 																																	Lausanne: The IOC is investigating allegations that Iraqi leader Saddam Husseins eldest son  who heads his countrys Olympic association  tortured and jailed athletes, an official said on Monday.				 																																	Weve received the complaint and were dealing with it, IOC Ethics Commission official Paquerette Girard Zappelli said.				 																																	She said she could not comment further while the inquiry was under way.				 																																	In December, the London-based human rights group Indict demanded that the IOC expel the Iraqi national Olympic committee from its ranks.				 																																	Citing witness statements by exiled Iraqi athletes and United Nations reports, Indict claimed Saddams son, Uday, once made a group of track athletes crawl on newly poured asphalt while they were beaten, and ordered that some be thrown off a bridge.				 																																	The group also alleged Uday ran a special prison for sportsmen who offended him.				 																																	 Melbourne: Aiming to help tennis players around the world find good matches, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) started a new rating system on Monday.				 																																	The system of ratings from 1 (beginner) to 10 (professional tour level) was adopted immediately by Australia. The ITF said it expected that very soon, the vast majority of players worldwide would have an International Tennis Number (ITN) rating.It said fewer than 20 nations now have rating systems, and these would remain alongside the ITN system.				 																																	It will help to increase participation throughout the world by helping social or competitive level players to match their skills with others of a similar ability, said ITF president Ricci Bitti. Ratings can be revised based on results in competition, the ITF said. 				 																																	Rio De Janeiro: Veteran striker Romario was injured warming up as the new-look Brazilian season made a lukewarm start at the weekend.				 																																	The 36-year-old, who signed a new one-year contract last week with Fluminense, pulled out of his sides opening home game in the Carioca (Rio de Janeiro) season against Olaria after feeling a pain in his right leg during pre-match exercises.				 																																	London: England have forced the International Badminton Federation (IBF) into an extraordinary general meeting over the sports scoring system which they say discriminates against women.				 																																	In doubles matches, women now play the best of three, first to 11 (3x11) as opposed to the mens 3x15.				 																																	Officials will defy the IBF by using the traditional way at the English national meet starting on January 31. It voted to revert to the old 3x15 in the mens singles and doubles, but made the womens singles and womens and mixed doubles 3x11.

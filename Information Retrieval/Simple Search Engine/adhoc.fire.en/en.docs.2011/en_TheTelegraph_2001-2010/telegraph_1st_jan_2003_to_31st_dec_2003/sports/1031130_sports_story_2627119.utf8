The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hinds, Edwards shine 
 - WI make it 2-2 as Zimbabwe fall 72 short of revised target  Wavell Hinds drives en route to his unbeaten 127 against Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club on Saturday. (AFP) Harare, Nov. 29 (Reuters): Blistering batting by Wavell Hinds and explosive bowling by Fidel Edwards led West Indies to a series-levelling victory over Zimbabwe on Saturday. Hinds scored 127 and fast bowler Edwards took six for 23 as the tourists won the rain-affected fourth one-day International by 72 runs to square the five-match series 2-2. The deciding game will be played at the same venue on Sunday. After being put into bat, West Indies scored 256 for three before rain ended their innings after 45 overs. Zimbabwe, set a target of 223 in 32 overs, reached 150 for seven, wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu top-scoring with 66. Hinds attacked the bowling consistently, pulling and driving with unstoppable power. He faced 141 balls and hit 10 fours and four sixes. Hinds and Chris Gayle set the tone of the innings early in their blitzkrieg opening stand of 96 struck off 91 balls. Gayle was even more aggressive than his partner, smashing his 51 off 34 balls. He hit seven fours and launched three sixes before slashing a delivery from medium pacer Sean Ervine to Taibu in the 16th over. An out-of-sorts Brian Lara had faced 25 balls for his 14 when he fished outside his off-stump to a wide delivery from medium pacer Gary Brent and was caught behind by Taibu. The Zimbabweans celebrated the breakthrough enthusiastically, but they grew gradually more subdued as Hinds and Ramnaresh Sarwan re-established the West Indies dominance with steady scoring all around the ground.

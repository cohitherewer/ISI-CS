The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
 IN on the Maidan. When it does, a lot many eyebrows are raised. It happened in the CFL fifth division Saturday, but young referee Sanjib Chatterjee said he didnt feel there was anything unusual in Southern Folks beating Armenians 18-0. The goals were evenly laid out: Shayama Prasad Das Gupta (4), Suman Pramanik (4), Supravat Kar (4), Partha Pratim Kar (3), Rudra Dhar, Sujoy Ghosh and Rajib Sen. There was no hattrick, though, at the match held at the Customs ground.It was a loudly one-sided match, said the referee later. Southern Folks were too strong for Armenians, too strong. They could not help scoring. I didnt see anything that could point to any foul play. Also, its early in the season for any positioning calculation to come into play. IFA secretary Subrata Dutta said he too did not believe there was any foul play involved and this probably happened because these teams (like Armenians) are fielding rather sub-standard teams.In another match, in the same division, Tara Friends and Ballygunge failed to break their barren deadlock, but Biju Mondal and Subhasis 2-1 to emerge Cooch Behar champions Saturday in their Britannia-Anandabazar Cup schools football meet. Susovan Sarkar scored both for the winners and Pinku Mondal CFL Super Division  Mohun Bagan vs Mohammedan AC (Salt Lake), 3.30 pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Australia stronger than SA, feels Wessels
 Cape Town: Former South Africa captain Kepler Wessels says Australia are a stronger team than the World Cup hosts. Australia and South Africa are the favourites to win the World Cup which starts in Cape Town on February 9 when the hosts take on the West Indies. They (Australia) are definitely a stronger side than South Africa and their path to the Super Six (second round) phase is more difficult, Wessels wrote in his column Friday. So, if they are going to go through they will have to be at their best all the time, added Wessels, who also played for Australia. It looks like their key players are going to be fit for the tournament. Its unbelievable that Shane Warne is bowling again after what looked like a serious (shoulder) injury. Warne, who said he would retire from one-day cricket after the tournament, will be determined to end his career on a high note. It shows exactly where Australian cricketers priorities lie. They enjoy one-day cricket but Test cricket is what really matters. Wessels said he was also impressed by the form of some of the other Australian players. Brett Lee was a sensation in the recent VB Series (against England and Sri Lanka). In the past he bowled in the shadow of Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie but their injuries gave him a chance to take more responsibility. It has done him a world of good. No one could fault his speed although his accuracy was always in question. But in that competition he bowled brilliantly at the end of the innings, said Wessels. Australia arrived in South Africa on Thursday.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Madaiah joins Shiv Prakash, Vijay on top
Bangalore: Local pro S. Madaiah shared the lead with veteran Shiv Prakash and Vijay Kumar, with a two-day total of two-under 142, at the end of the second round of the Hero Honda Open South 2003 on Wednesday. Twelve caddy boys followed their hero Madaiah as he went on a birdie spree, sinking six of them. Though he ended the day at two-under 70,a level-par first round ensured that he shared the lead with Prakash and Kumar, who returned cards of one on ninth position.  As many as 50 professionals made it to the money-making rounds after the cut was applied at nine-over 153. Chennai based amateur Gurunath Melyappan was the lone amateur to make the pro cut. Binod Pandey, who had a hole-in-one on the first day, missed the cut along with veterans Rohtas Singh and Pappan. Meanwhile, debutant Gurbaaz Maan fired six birdies for a three-under 69 to record the days best score. Madaiah began with a birdie on the third, while also holing a 15-footer on the eighth. Earlier, he holed a 25-footer on the 10th.. His other bogeys came on the fifth, where he found water on the right of his tee shot and missed two small putts on the seventh and 17th. Defending champion Vijay Kumar found the greens in regulation often, but ran into bad luck while sinking them.  Copyright

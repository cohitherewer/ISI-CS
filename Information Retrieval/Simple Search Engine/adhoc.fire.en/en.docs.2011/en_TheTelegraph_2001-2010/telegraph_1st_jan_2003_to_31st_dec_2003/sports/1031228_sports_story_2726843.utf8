 Arindam carries bat through
 Arindam hit 215 n.o. Ahmedabad, Dec. 27 (PTI): Opener Arindam Das carried his bat through to score an unbeaten 215 as Bengal took a massive 300-run first-innings lead against Gujarat on Day III of Elite Group B match at the Motera on Saturday. At stumps, Gujarat were one for 74, Utpal Chatterjee getting the only wicket. Arindam, starting the day on 117, struck 23 fours and a six as the visitors amassed 479 in reply to Gujarats 179. The opener brought up his double century with an elegant cover-drive. It was for Aridams effort that Bengal went past the 400-mark, after being reduced to eight for 342. With Sourashish Lahiri, he put up a 106-run partnership.  Copyright

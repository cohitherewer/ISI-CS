The Telegraph - Calcutta
 South Africa seize control 
 Ntini (5/75), Hall (3/18)  skittle out hosts for 173 on Day 1 Graeme Smith became  the fastest South African to complete 1000 runs  London: Makhaya Ntini took  five wickets and Graeme Smith hit an unbeaten 80 as South  Africa seized control of the second Test against England  at Lords on Thursday. England were ripped out for 173  on a blameless track as strike bowler Ntini took five for  75. He was backed up by allrounder Andrew Hall, who celebrated  his recall on his 28th birthday with three for 18. Smith and Herschelle Gibbs (49),  who put on an opening stand of 338 in the first Test, managed  133 this time as South Africa ended on 151 for one. Smith had just one scare as he  was dropped off a simple chance at point by Nasser Hussain  after making eight. Smiths first run of the day made  him the fastest South African in history to 1,000 Test runs,  reaching the mark in his 17th innings. He had made 277 and  85 at Edgbaston. Ntini probably edged the honours,  though, with five wickets for the third time in his Test  career. He accounted for Marcus Trescothick  (6), new England captain Michael Vaughan (33), Alec Stewart  (7) and allrounder Andrew Flintoff (11) before completing  his collection by bowling Steve Harmison. At least four of Englands batsmen  contributed to their dismissals with rash shots. Trescothick was the first wicket  of the day, leaving his angled bat dangling outside off  and edging the ball back into his stumps with the score  on 11. Butcher drove Ntini for three  consecutive boundaries before he was squared up by Shaun  Pollock on the back foot and edged to Hall at third slip  to make it 35 for two. Vaughan and Hussain, however,  looked in little danger as they took the score to 73 in  the run-up to lunch only for three wickets to fall for 12  runs in 10 deliveries. Hussain, driving loosely at Halls  bustling medium-paced seamers, was bowled for 14, Anthony  McGrath chipped Hall off a leading edge to wide mid-off  and Vaughan, rashly hooking against Ntini, skied to fine  leg for 33 to leave England on 85 for five. The procession continued after  the break, wicketkeeper Alec Stewart pulling lamely to short  square leg, Ashley Giles edging to slip and allrounder Andrew  Flintoff hooking Ntini straight to deep square leg for 11. When Ntini bowled Harmison for  a duck England were on 118 for nine. Darren Gough, who top-scored with  34, and James Anderson (21 not out) put on 55 for the last  wicket for England to save some face. Gough, playing cautiously, accumulated  quietly before hitting two sixes in four balls, one to midwicket  and one straight, off Paul Adams wrist spin. The excellent if unlucky Pollock,  though, returned to remove him and finish with two for 28  off 14.4 overs. Copyright

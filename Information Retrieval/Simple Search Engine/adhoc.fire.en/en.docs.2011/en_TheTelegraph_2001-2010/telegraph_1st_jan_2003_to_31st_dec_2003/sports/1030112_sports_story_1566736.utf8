		 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 England lose thriller 
				 	 Damien Martyn sweeps en route to his 101 Saturday																								Hobart, Jan. 11 (Reuters): Australia, led by Damien Martyns unbeaten century, scored a thrilling seven-run victory in their tri-series match on Saturday after England failed to capitalise on a 165-run opening stand. 																								Needing 12 runs to win with four wickets in hand at the start of the last over, England could manage only four runs for the loss of Nasser Hussain, who made a gallant 43 off 38 balls.																								Tailender Andy Caddick faced the last three balls, hitting a two, then missing the final two deliveries from 21-year-old Shane Watson. 																								Australia won the toss and batted first, scoring 271 for four as Martyn reached his fourth century with a boundary off Caddick to fine leg from the last ball of the innings. 																								Trescothick and Nick Knight (85) put the tourists in a strong position with a polished opening stand of 165 in less than 32 overs but England slumped to 211 for five, losing three wickets for 18, before finishing on 264 for seven.

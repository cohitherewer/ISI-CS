The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roma claim final berth
 - Italian Cup Roma captain Francesco  Totti jumps over Lazio goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani at  Romes Olympic Stadium Wednesday  Rome: AS Roma kept their  stuttering season alive by clinching a place in the Italian  Cup final Wednesday at the expense of city rivals Lazio.  A goal from second-half substitute  Vincenzo Montella gave Roma a 1-0 semi-final, second leg  victory at the Olympic Stadium and a 3-1 aggregate win.  Knocked out in the second phase  of the Champions League and languishing mid-table in Serie  A, Roma will meet AC Milan in a two-legged final, which  rewards the winner with a place in next seasons Uefa Cup.  Lazio, lying fourth in Serie A,  had the majority of chances but failed to convert any of  them as the Roma defence held firm.  Lazio, beaten 1-4 by Porto in  the first-leg of their Uefa cup semi-final last week, still  may outshine their neighbours by qualifying for next seasons  Champions League. Roma coach Fabio Capello acknowledged  the fact that should Milan finish in the top four, which  they look set to do, Roma would automatically qualify for  the Uefa Cup, as their Cup final opponents would make the  Champions League. This victory has opened the door  to Europe, he said. It was an important win for us as  we can salvage something from the season.  Lazio coach Roberto Mancini said  he was unhappy not to make the final, but admitted he had  more important things on his mind.  We got to this stage of the competition  and obviously wanted to win, but we still have two important  objectives, he said.  Although our task is difficult,  we are still in the Uefa Cup and are hopeful of finishing  in the top four and qualify for the Champions League.  Roma were without Brazilian wing-back  Cafu and striker Marco Delvecchio who were both suffering  from thigh injuries, while Greek defender Traianos Dellas  was suspended.  Frenchman Vincent Candela switched  over from his normal left-wing position to replace Cafu  and Antonio Cassano filled in for Delvecchio.  Bernardo Corradi returned from  injury to play alongside Claudio Lopez in Lazios attack.  Lazio enjoyed the better of a  first-half littered with mistakes and niggly fouls, while  Roma failed to register a single shot on target.  Ivan Pelizzoli almost gifted Lazio  an early goal when he dropped Sinisa Mihajlovics inswinging  corner, but the Roma goalkeeper redeemed himself by gathering  the ball at the second attempt.  The best chance of the first 45  minutes fell to Lopez in the 24th minute. Pelizzoli misjudged the bounce  from a high ball, handing possession to Lopez who shot towards  goal only to strike the outside of the post.  A sometimes fractious first-half  ended with Paolo Negro being cautioned for a late foul on  Roma captain Francesco Totti.  Lazio kept up the pressure at  the start of the second-half and only a superb reflex save  by Pelizzoli low to his right kept out Corradis drive.  Roma eventually took the lead  against the run of play in the 56th minute after Damiano  Tomassi had been denied by a brave block by Lazio goalkeeper  Luca Marchegiani.  Candelas teasing left-wing cross  was dropped by Marchegiani at the feet of Montella, who  rammed the ball home from a yard out. After substitute Diego  Simeone was cautioned for hauling back Montella, Pelizzoli,  who looked nervous throughout, almost gifted Lazio an equaliser  when he made a hash of Negros 25-yard shot.  As Lazio desperately poured forward  Enrico Chiesa came close when his delicate chip sailed over  Pelizzoli before Dejan Stankovic had a goal ruled out for  offside. Yesterday, AC Milan booked their  place in the final after edging Perugia 2-1 at the San Siro  Stadium in Milan. Jon Dahl Tomasson broke the deadlock  with a close range effort four minutes from half-time, before  Alessandro Nesta scored his first goal for the club with  a firm header seven minutes after the break. The visitors rallied in the closing  stages and pulled a goal back in the 83rd minute thanks  to second-half substitute Andrea Caracciolos volley. Seeking a place in the final for  the first time, Perugia pressed for the equaliser that would  have taken them through on the away goals rule, but milan  survived several scares to hold on. Milan, four-time winners of the  trophy, went through to the final 2-1 on aggregate, having  drawn the first leg in Umbria 0-0. (AFP) Copyright

				 																																	Sydney: Olympic taekwondo champion Lauren Burns has pleaded with thieves to return a gold medal stolen from her home. Burns, a surprise winner in the 49 kilogram division at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, returned from Paris Wednesday to find her medal had been stolen during a robbery. Im totally devastated, Burns said Thursday. I had so many dreams last night about finding it. I got up this morning and felt that it was going to be there on the kitchen table.				 																																	Burns said police believe the thieves did not realise the medal had no value to anyone but her. Were just hoping that they will be able to find it in the kindness of their hearts to give it back to me, Burns said. Australian Olympic Committee chief executive Bob Elphinston said they would seek a replacement for Burns medal if it was not found. Rome: Lazio striker Simone Inzaghi has  been ruled out of action for at least a month after tests  confirmed a fractured left hand, the club said on Wednesday.  The Italian international, younger brother of AC Milans  Filippo Inzaghi, was injured in Lazios 1-0 win at Ancona  in Serie A at the weekend. The loss of his most prolific  scorer is another blow to Lazio coach Roberto Mancini, who  is struggling to assemble a full-strength side for Sundays  match at home to Inter Milan.

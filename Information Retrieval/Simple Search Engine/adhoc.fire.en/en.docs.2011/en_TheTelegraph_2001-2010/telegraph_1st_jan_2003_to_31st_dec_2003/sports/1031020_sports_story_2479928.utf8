The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Atwal finishes third
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Calcutta-based Arjun Atwal showed steady improvement over the rounds in the Macau Open to finish a very creditable third, Sunday, according to information received here. The tournament was won by the great Scotsman Colin Montgomerie, who hit a three-under fourth round to pull alongside overnight leader Scott Barr of Australia who parred his Round IV. Montgomerie won on sudden-death play-off on first extra hole. Atwal never had over-par or even a par round. He started one under, and steadily improved to 69 and 68, 68 (275) to beat the fourth-placed bunch of Kevin Na of Korea, Lu Wei-lan of Chinese Taipei, and Jason Knutzon of the US (all 277).

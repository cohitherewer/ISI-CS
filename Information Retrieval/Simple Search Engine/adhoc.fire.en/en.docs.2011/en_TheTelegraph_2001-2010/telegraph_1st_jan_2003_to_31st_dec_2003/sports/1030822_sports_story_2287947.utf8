 Rameez to push for resumption
Karachi: Rameez Raja will push for the resumption of India-Pakistan cricket ties, stalled for some three years, during a visit to India next month. Rameez, the Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive, has been invited to the ICC cricket committee management meeting in Mumbai in September. Rameez said he would use the visit to meet BCCI and government officials to push for ties to start again. The visit provides us with an opportunity to tell the Indian people and officials why it is important to have regular cricket ties, he said. This allows us to highlight the futility of not playing each other, he said. (Reuters)  Copyright

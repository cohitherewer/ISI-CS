 Selectors deny secret Steve deal 
 Sydney: Cricket Australia on Friday ridiculed  Australian media reports which claimed a secret deal had  been struck between the selectors and Steve Waugh who was  guaranteed a Test spot in the home series this summer  in return for an honourable exit.  Trevor Hohns, chairman of selectors, termed suggestions  by former captain Mark Taylor that the panel struck a deal  with Waugh guaranteeing him selection for the India series  if he were to retire at the end of it as ridiculous. Steve (Waugh) himself has always said he doesnt expect any guarantees and we dont give anybody any guarantees about their place in the Australian cricket side, Hohns was quoted as saying by Foxsports.  What we can guarantee now is  to do our utmost to make sure Steve goes out the way he  wants to, said Hohns, who denied Waughs retirement removed  for the selectors the job of deciding on his future.I did  not think that hard decision was there yet. Look at his  form, his form was outstanding (in the last 12 months). Waughs predecessor Taylor, writing a syndicated column in an Australian daily, said 38-year-old Waughs decision to retire at the end of the fourth Test against India at his home ground of Sydney, might not have been completely his own. I get the feeling there has been a little guarantee given to him by the selectors that if you are going to announce your retirement in Sydney, we can guarantee you a spot in the side until that time, Taylor wrote. Hohns admitted he was surprised by Waughs announcement but denied the selectors played a role in his decision. Neither did he feel the prolonged national debate over his Test place was an influence on the 164-Test veterans decision.  There has been some innuendo about that but that  is a ridiculous thing to even contemplate, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

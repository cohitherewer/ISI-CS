The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hussain unlikely to watch decisive game
Port Elizabeth: Nasser Hussain will probably not watch the World Cup group A match which could decide his future as England captain. Hussain faces an anxious two-day wait to find out if his teams tournament is over, as the result of the clash between Pakistan and Zimbabwe in Bulawayo on Tuesday will determine the the final group standings. I dont know if Ill be paying that much notice to that game as its out of our hands, said Hussain. We will know at the end of Tuesday whether the result has gone our way, but we have enough problems with our own game without having to worry about winning games for other people. England have finished with 12 points. Victory for Zimbabwe Tuesday would eliminate England from the tournament as Heath Streaks side would reach the 16-point mark and Pakistan would remain on 12. But Hussains side will advance to the next phase if Pakistan  as expected  win in Bulawayo to tie with England on points without bettering the latters net run rate. England already have the best run rate (0.821) of the three rivals and Pakistan would have to pull off an extraordinary win to sneak through. If Zimbabwe bat first and score 200, Waqar Younis side would have to reach the total in 13.2 overs to get through. But if Pakistan batted first and made 250, they would need to dismiss their opponents for 62 or less. (Reuters)  Copyright

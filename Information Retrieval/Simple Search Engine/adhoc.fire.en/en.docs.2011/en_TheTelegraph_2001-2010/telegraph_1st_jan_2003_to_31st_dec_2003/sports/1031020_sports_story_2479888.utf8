The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I was praying for my father, says Kamal
Lahore: Pakistans debutant Asim Kamal was thinking about his sick father than his hundred when he was dismissed for 99 in the first Test against South Africa on Sunday. My father is very sick. He undergoes regular dialysis and has other complications. I kept on thinking about him and praying to God to make him well again when I approached my hundred, Kamal said. It is strange but I was not really thinking about my hundred. My fathers condition and image was in my mind. I am very close to him and his condition has been a concern for me, he said. The 27-year-old left-hander became only the third man after Arthur Chipperfield of Australia and Robert Christiani of West Indies to be dismissed for 99 in his debut Test. I spoke to my father before coming here. He told me if I performed well it would make him happy. I wanted to give him some happiness, he said. (Reuters)  Copyright

		 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 Patience will be key: Caddick
				 	 Richard Dawson in a playful mood with Andy Caddick after the dismissal of Justin Langer in Sydney on Sunday																								Sydney: Andy Caddick says he expects England to beat Australia in the fifth Ashes Test after seizing control on Sunday.																								I think its going to be very difficult to bat on this wicket tomorrow and weve just got to get the ball in the right areas and be patient, he said. I expect to win this game.																								Caddick captured the wickets of Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting in the Australian second innings to overtake Darren Gough in seventh place on Englands list of all-time wicket-takers with 229 scalps.																								But the 34-year-old shrugged off his personal milestone, saying his only interest was in trying to help England win the game to end an otherwise wretched series on a high note.																								Its good that 2002s gone and weve started 2003 on a good note, Caddick said. Hopefully we can get a win under our belt here, continue that on through the one-dayers and go home with a bit of pride.																								Coachs thoughts																								Australian coach John Buchanan said his team was still contemplating the chance of winning, despite needing to break a host of batting records. Australia havent lost a Test at home in more than four years.																								Wed rather not be three down at this stage but weve got seven wickets in the bank and Damien Martyn and Andy Bichel have put on 60-odd at this stage, Buchanan said.																								Were (scoring) around four runs an over so, on the basis thats there 90 overs left and 360 runs to go, then obviously the run target is right if we can preserve wickets.																								Weve got Stephen (Waugh) and Martin Love and Adam Gilchrist...so if we can get to tea time with still the majority of those wickets intact then who knows what the game presents?																								Buchanan said Australia would have to change their gameplan and try and force a draw if they lost early wickets.																								A win would be a sensational but a draw would probably be a very good result as well. 																								From Englands point of view, I think theyve got some momentum going into the last day and what we have to do is to arrest that. (REUTERS)

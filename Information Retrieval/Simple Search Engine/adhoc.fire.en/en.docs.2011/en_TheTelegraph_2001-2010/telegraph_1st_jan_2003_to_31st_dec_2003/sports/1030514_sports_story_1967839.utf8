The Telegraph - Calcutta
 My best effort ever: Sarwan
 Glenn McGrath and Ramnaresh Sarwan in a face-off on the fourth day of the final Test in Antigua Monday. (Reuters) St Johns: West Indies Ramnaresh Sarwan, who hauled West Indies back into the final Test against Australia on Monday, rated his effort the best in his Test career. A 105 against Australia is very special to me, said Sarwan, whose runs helped West Indies reach 371 for six at the close of the fourth day after they were set 418 to win. Its the best Ive batted in Test cricket. Sarwan, who has only previously made one Test century, admitted he was frustrated at the manner of his dismissal as he miscued an attempted pull and sent the ball looping into the hands of bowler Brett Lee, who took an easy catch. I got out pulling but its not something I want to give up on. Its given me a lot of runs and Ive just going to have to be more selective, he said. I didnt execute the shot properly and I was disappointed, having got that far again. Sarwan was impressed with 20-year-old off-spinner Omari Banks, who shared an unbeaten 83-run seventh-wicket partnership with Shivnarine Chanderpaul as they took West Indies within 47 runs of their target with four wickets in hand. I think Omari has given us positive vibes, its good to see a young player come into the team and bat so positively, that is something that has been lacking in the batting department, he said. Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist denied that his team had become overconfident after dismissing Brian Lara for 60 to leave West Indies 165 for four. I dont think we underestimated Chanderpaul, Sarwan or Banks. Were still in it, one early wicket puts all the pressure on them but it was a great chase by their guys.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Rooney in squad despite injury
London: England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson named Evertons injured striker Wayne Rooney on Monday in his 25-man squad for three upcoming matches. Rooney, 17, is included despite suffering knee ligament damage in Evertons final match of the season against Manchester United on Sunday, but there was no room for 39-year-old keeper David Seaman. England play South Africa in Durban on May 22, Serbia and Montenegro in another friendly at Leicester on June 3 and Slovakia in their next Euro 2004 Group Seven qualifier at Middlesbroughs Riverside Stadium on June 11. Players involved in next Saturdays FA Cup final between Arsenal and Southampton will not travel to South Africa but will join the squad on their return. Skipper David Beckham, who is suspended for the qualifier against Slovakia, will be rested for the friendly at Leicester after travelling to South Africa. As for Rooney, Eriksson said: Hes doing a scan today and after that well see whats happening. But anyhow, he will come on Sunday to our hotel and there well take a decision if hes coming to South Africa or not. A day after West Ham United were relegated to the first division, their keeper David James kept his place as Englands number one at the expense of Seaman  who is considering his playing future. Defender Sol Campbell is unavailable due to an Achilles injury, but Southampton striker James Beattie was recalled  along with West Ham midfielder Trevor Sinclair and Leicester City keeper Ian Walker.

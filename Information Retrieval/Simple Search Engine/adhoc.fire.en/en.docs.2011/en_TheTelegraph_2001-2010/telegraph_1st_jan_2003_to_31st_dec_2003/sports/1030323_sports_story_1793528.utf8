The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Enjoying our cricket makes a difference
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Hayden: A major threat in the final Matthew Hayden was just another member of Steve Waughs team when he landed in India for the 2000-2001 series. By the time Hayden left, he was a hero  549 runs in the three Tests (average 109.80) and 303 in four ODIs (average 75.75). The left-hander hasnt looked back since. While the ongoing World Cup hasnt exactly gone his way, Hayden (31) remains a threat in Sundays final. One who always comes across as fiercely determined, Hayden spoke to The Telegraph over breakfast the other day. Excerpts: Q His one-day career effectively taking off on that 2000-2001 tour... A Indeed, I was asked to stay back after the Test series... Fact is, I was a consistent scorer in the domestic limited overs cricket, but never really got opportunities... Being asked to stay on was nice and I was confident because, basically, Ive always thought I had a good one-day gameplan. Whether he regards that India tour as the turning point... Yeah... That trip confirmed to everyone else that I had the ability... More important, that I could deliver in both forms. It certainly helped that I got 549 runs in the Test series. Cricket has much to do with momentum and I didnt lack that while in India. On the flip -side, you can also quickly lose momentum. His exposure to a spin bowlers clinic in Chennai (before his comeback)... Bishan Bedi and (Srinivas) Venkatraghavan were there... I got a bowlers perspective and utilised that to hone my batting skills. I implemented the tips at Northamptonshire, too... That exposure gave me the confidence to take on the Indian spinners in that last series... A batsman must know what he wants to achieve and must have the courage to take necessary steps. Against spinners, for example, youve got to have the courage to leave the crease... Your feet do much of the talking. His rather heavy appetite for runs... (Laughs) Wanting to do well for Australia does whet the appetite. Not having been a regular, except in the last couple of years, has made me appreciate better the value of playing for the country... Indeed, this appetite keeps you going when you feel a little flat. Whether, despite this appetite, he still needs to psyche himself given the amount of cricket being played... To talk of this World Cup, its important (for the development of cricket) to play Kenya and Holland and Namibia but, from a psychological and professional point, you will win those games and, so, its hard to stay up... Such periods, then, do come about... Its important to conserve energy and get it going during the business-end  which is now, the final. The years he wasnt a regular... Playing for Hampshire in 1997 and Northants in 1999 and 2000 proved a boon... Helped me understand my game, helped me understand myself... Actually, helped my cricket gather momentum. Of course, its the international action that I was focussed on... Seeking to earn recognition at the highest level is what kept driving me, not the financial rewards. Being a good analyser of the game... Ive always been so. In the early years, though, I would over-analyse. Now, with experience, I just try to be competitive... If Im competitive, my natural game will dominate anyway. What prompted him to analyse from the very beginning... I didnt have as much talent as some of the others... Didnt see myself as naturally gifted and, so, had to work hard... Analysing was a passion, yet a time came when I had to say enough was enough and that I should just play... That Id developed and it was time to move on. This came about when I was the Northants captain. His form in this World Cup... I would have been happier with more runs, definitely, but this is it... The final isnt many hours away and... For us, the tournament really began with the semi-finals. Opening with Justin Langer in Tests and Adam Gilchrist in the one-dayers... (Smiles) Justin and I have been through the hard times together, so theres a natural bonding. We understand the frustrations, understand the importance of working together as a combination... Weve always been great mates... Adam and I are different, its like getting two cords to unite and... Its an instinctive partnership, its happened... We love playing shots. Whether theres a shot-making rivalry with Gilchrist... We look to keep our respective tempo on track... The reality, however, is that Adam has shots at his discretion earlier than I get into the act. Against spinners, though, my tempo will be more pronounced... I dont look to be ahead of Adam and, likewise, Im sure Adam doesnt consciously look to be ahead of me. What goes into the making of a good opening firm... Youve got to be mates on and off the field. Then, youve got to be honest with each other. If the ball is swinging about, its possible an opener can get lost technically. Thats when the partner comes into the picture... Theres a saying in our dressing room that the opening combination forms the Engine Room of Australian cricket. Thats a huge responsibility, but we battle the hard times and enjoy every success that comes our way. The nerves associated with opening... Cant be avoided... The best way of overcoming a butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling is to quickly sink into the match and to get on with the job. Whether he respects any one bowler... (After a pause) Andy Caddick was very good when we toured England in 2001... Shoaib Akhtars pace has been a challenge... The runs, though, have come easy as he creates so many angles. Generally, I dont think Ive faced a better bowler than Wasim Akram... Tremendous control, gets it to swing early and late... He has such a lovely action, doesnt he? Whether he is conscious of records and averages... Doesnt drive me, though I have an idea of where Im placed. What Im conscious about is treating every ball as an event in itself. (After a pause) I dont concern myself too much with what happened in the last series/tournament... I look to the next game, the next series/tournament. Steve Waughs role in getting him back into the Australian team... The time I was out, but would continue doing well in domestic competition, was also a time Steve would regularly call and say keep going, keep going. I wont forget that... Steve must have felt I had the ability, but didnt have opportunities... As captain, he was determined to give me that. It makes a huge difference when somebody wants you to be there. Allan Borders influence... I played with him at different levels and enjoyed the way he went about the business of getting runs... He wont be remembered as the most talented, but hes got the most number of Test runs. Allan showed you dont need to have every shot in the book to play Test cricket. Having the mental toughness and realising your limitations is important. He fought hard, which fits into my ethos. Whether he gets to unwind... Do try and make the time... If Im to only think of cricket, that will weigh me down. Where I can, I head for the beach and surf... Im also fond of fishing... At home, I like spending quality time with my wife (Kelly) and infant daughter (Grace). Finally, being such an important member of a powerful Australian side... (Smiles again) Yeah, we dont say no too often and win a lot of games... That we enjoy our cricket, I believe, makes a difference. Also, the fact that we are such good mates  the Australian dressing room has that culture.  Copyright

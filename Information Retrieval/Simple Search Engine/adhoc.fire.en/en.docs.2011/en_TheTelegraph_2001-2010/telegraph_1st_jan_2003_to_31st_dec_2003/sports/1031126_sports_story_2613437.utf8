 Uefa opts for neutral venues
Nyon: Uefa has switched two Champions League games and a Uefa Cup tie from Turkey to neutral venues due to security concerns, European soccers governing body said on Tuesday. Two suicide bomb attacks on the British consulate and HSBC headquarters in Istanbul last week killed 31 people and injured hundreds more. The attacks followed bombings at two Istanbul synagogues this month that killed 25 people. Galatasarays Champions League match with Juventus, initially due to be played on Tuesday, and Besiktas game against Chelsea in two weeks will be played outside Turkey. The dates and venues have yet to be decided. The decision...follows a broad evaluation of the current threat to security, the advice offered by various governments, including the assurances offered by the Turkish government, and the investigations still being undertaken, Uefa said. Israeli club Maccabi Haifa, not permitted to play in their home country because of safety issues, will also have their Uefa Cup tie against Valencia moved from Turkey. (Reuters)  Copyright

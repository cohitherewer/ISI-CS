The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Very harsh, say Bengal bowlers
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Deep Dasgupta thinks the sense of belonging is missing Calcutta: The new Duleep Trophy format hasnt thrilled all cricketers. The bowlers, in particular, dont seem to be happy. Of the six from Bengal who played Duleep Trophy this season  Rohan Gavaskar, Sourashish Lahiri (Elite B), Ranadeb Bose, Devang Gandhi, Deep Dasgupta (Elite A) and Laxmi Ratan Shukla (Elite C)  the bowling trio of Ranadeb, Sourashish and Laxmi feels they didnt get enough chance to show their skills. Former India stumper Deep is of the opinion that a sense of belonging doesnt come in this kind of a format. Devang feels that only performance counts. Since the boys are coming from different parts, its tough to adjust. The sense of belonging doesnt really come in, Deep said. However, the plus point of this format is that it gives the younger players a chance to interact with the seniors. Ranadeb, Bengals highest wicket-taker (45) this season, hit out at the format which has done away with zonal sides. In one game after I took two wickets on Day I, I just wasnt given a bowl on Day II. Then in another match, Irfan Pathan and Sarandeep Singh took the new ball and I was made to stand at deep thirdman the whole day. Bengal off-spinner Sourashish sounded equally disappointed. The fellow-feeling is lacking in this sort of a system. Also, when the captain doesnt know your strength, you are not properly used. In the first game Sourashish played, Rohan was his captain. But after that M.S.K. Prasad took over. I was underbowled, but maybe I could have done a bit better. He was dropped for the last two games. Shukla said: I bowled quite well in the first match. Though I didnt get a wicket, I conceded 40 runs in 17 overs. Strangely, I didnt get a chance to play in the next games, Laxmi added. Gandhi didnt support the fellow-feeling theory. The belonging only comes in when youre performing. Its a good format and it almost feels like playing for the country.  Copyright

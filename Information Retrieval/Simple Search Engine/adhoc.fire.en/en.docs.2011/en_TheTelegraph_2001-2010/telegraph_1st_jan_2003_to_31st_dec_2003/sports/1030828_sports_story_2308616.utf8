The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lucky win for Sharmin
 BY A CORRESPONDENT  Bangladeshs Minhazuddin A. Sagar ponders a move at Gorky Sadan on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Dame luck smiled on Sharmin Sultana Shirin of Bibi Mariam Girls High School, Dhaka in the third round of The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Alekhine Chess Club, Gorky Sadan on Wenesday. Playing with the black pieces, against the 11th seed, Debayan Majumdar of St James School, Sharmin was clearly in an inferior position in the Maroczy Bind variation of the Sicilian defence, but Debayan failed to make the requisite 40 moves in the prescribed time limit and had to forfeit the game on time. At the end of the round, 26 players share the lead with 3 points. Top seed, Rahul Sangma of Govt High School, Chhapra, Bihar had to face some anxious moments against Sumit Shaw of St Lawrence HS in a Sicilian defence. The game, at one time, was heading for a draw but Rahul broke through on the opposite wing to win the game in 62 moves. National sub-junior girls champion Mary Ann Gomes of Frank Correa Academy outsmarted Ramkrishna Perumalla of Hyderabad quite easily in the Najdorf variation of the Sicilian defence. Mary Ann skilfully exploited the dark square weakness on her opponents diagonal set up a mating net and won in 32 moves. Second seed, Akshat Khamparia of B.E.M.S.S. School (MP) had little difficulty in getting the better of Angam G. Singh of Numjao Lairembi HS, Manipur in 32 moves in a Sicilian defence. In a clash between two Bangladeshis, Samima Akter Liza of Bibi Mariam Girls HS got the better of compatriot Najir Arifin of Rajarbag School in just 20 moves in a Slav defence.

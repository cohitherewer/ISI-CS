 India colts end on a high
Kathmandu: The Indian under-19 team completed a 3-0 whitewash when they defeated Nepal by four wickets in the third and final one-dayer at the Tribhuvan University cricket ground in Kirtipur here on Wednesday. India, who had won the earlier two games easily, met with some resistance from the hosts in this game, but prevailed in the end. Replying to Nepals 143 for eight in 27 overs, India reached the target in 26.3 overs with four wickets in hand. Put in to bat, Nepal were helped by K. Chaugai, whose 46 was the highest for the hosts, and a 22-run knock by S. Pant. The other Nepalese batsmen, however, failed to contribute. U. Patel grabbed four wickets while Abhishek Sharma picked two. The Indian reply was in some trouble at 64 for three but Y. G. Rao (38) and S. Biswas steered the team to safety after A. T. Rayudu (38) had given the team a steady start in the company of M. Bisla (16). BRIEF SCORES Nepal: 143/8 in 27 ovs (K. Chaugai 46, S. Pant 22; U. Patel 4/25, A.

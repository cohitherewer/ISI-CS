The Telegraph - Calcutta
 2 states approach Malhotra
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Former Bengal captain Ashok Malhotra may be seen a coach of either Maharashtra or Assam in the forthcoming season. Malhotra told The Telegraph he has offers from those states. Maharashtra contacted me twice while Assam have also shown interest, he said. But Im still waiting for a decision from the CAB. If they want me as coach, then I would love to be associated with Bengal, Malhotra added. Bengal, meanwhile, is still waiting for a reply from W.V. Raman, who has been approached to take charge. It is learnt that Raman is currently in Bangalore and has asked for a clearance from his employers in Chennai. Well wait for a couple of days more for Ramans decision. If he cannot get his clearance, we will have to move ahead, a CAB official said. It was also learnt that an outstation coach, and not Malhotra, will be in demand, if Raman is unavailable. However, Malhotra doesnt rule himself out of the reckoning.  Copyright

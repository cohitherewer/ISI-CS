 UCBSA concerned over report leakage 
Durban: The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) has expressed concern over the leakage of the reports, prepared by a psychologist and a fitness expert to look into the reasons for the hosts poor performance in the World Cup. The reports by fitness trainer Andrew Gray and psychologist Clinton Gohwiler published in all major newspapers in the country on Wednesday, blamed psychological problems faced by South African players and their irresponsible lifestyles for the teams first-round exit. I am concerned that reports containing confidential medical information about players have been leaked to the media, particularly as they have not yet been fully discussed by the UCBSA, board CEO Gerald Majola said. Majola said the reports had been discussed by the board at a meeting on April 15 and would be discussed by the National Cricket Committee (NCC) at the month end. Pointing out that the board was concerned about the findings in the reports, Majola said efforts are on to include some clauses in the players contracts which stipulate certain fitness requirements. Lance Klusener said the report was a huge red herring. Meanwhile, South African coach Eric Simons, who is currently in Bangladesh, issued a statement through the UCBSA on behalf of his squad in which he attacked the leaking of the document and said much of the report had been taken out of context. It was with anger and frustration that I learnt about the article..., Simons said in the statement. Clearly it was written by a journalist with no understanding or knowledge of the team or our World Cup campaign. As coach I have seen both the report and the article and it is clear that the writer has chosen to exaggerate and twist the content purely for the sake of sensationalism as the article makes no attempt to present the facts fairly. Obviously, as a squad we are desperately disappointed at the outcome of our World Cup campaign. But the issues raised so sensationally in the article were dealt with months before the tournament and were not, in any way, a factor at any stage of the tournament, Simons said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Md. Sp. look to win vs bankmen
Chennai: Mohammadan Sporting would be looking for revenge when they take on local outfit Indian Bank in the National Football League Wednesday. The Calcutta team, winners of the prestigious Federation Cup a number of times, suffered the humiliation of having been relegated to the second division by Indian Banks win in the vital match in 2001 and are now determined to settle scores. It appears to be an easy proposition for the Calcutta outfit, who have won a match and drawn one as against four losses in six outings, as Indian Bank are playing in the league for the last time this season, having lost all their five home matches so far. The visitors playing under their new coach, Jamshed Nassiri, have shown improvement after three successive losses by sharing with giants Vasco, but continue to remain the 11th team, just a rung above Indian Bank. Nassiri, a former striker, said he has come to terms with the team now, which is working well in all department of the game. I am impressed with the performances of the strikers, medios and stoppers in the previous games. If they perform as much they had done in the game against Churchill Brothers and Vasco, we should win against the bankmen on the morrow, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

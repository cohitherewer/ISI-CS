 Kasparov loses Game II 
New York: Garri Kasparov lost the second game of the Man vs Machine match against the computer programme X3D Fritz after a three-hour battle Thursday. The result left the world champion trailing 0-5-1.5 in the four-game series following a draw in the first. Kasparov, playing black, blundered late in the game, allowing X3D Fritzs queen to penetrate deep into his territory. The former world champion, unable to recover or defend his king, resigned on the 39th move. Grandmaster Maurice Ashley felt Kasparovs blunder was terrible. Kasparov must win the remaining two games to clinch the match. (AP)  Copyright

		 Wednesday, October 22, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Barcelona: Barcelona president Joan Laporta has reportedly lost faith in Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard and is considering calling in Johan Cruyff. 				 																																	Cruyff had a successful if turbulent career as a player and coach with Barcelona, who won four Spanish titles under his guidance as well as their only European Cup in 1992. He was sacked in 1996 but is a personal friend of Laporta. The Mundo Deportivo claims Laporta believes only a man of Cruyffs stature can help Rijkaard revive Barcelona who slumped to 11th in the table after Saturdays 0-2 home defeat to Deportivo La Coruna. Laporta would apparently keep Rijkaard as coach with Cruyff, who now is seen more often on a golf course or in broadcasting, working alongside him. 				 																																	London: Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has decided not to appeal against his two-match ban and fine for abusing a match official, the English FA said on Tuesday.

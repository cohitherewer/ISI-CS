The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Fitzgerald backs Hewitt
Melbourne: Former world No.1 Lleyton Hewitt will be back to his best for the Davis Cup semi-final tie against Switzerland in September, Australias captain John Fitzgerald said on Monday. The 22-year-old Australian was beaten in the first round at Wimbledon by Croatian Ivo Karlovic and slumped last week from second to fifth in the 12-month ATP rankings. Hes enough of a professional to bounce back and it was a very unusual match-up for him, Fitzgerald said. It took a guy who was six foot 10 (2.08 metres) and serving like a genius to beat him. Also the (Wimbledon centre) court is very green on the first day and it turned into a different game. If he won that game, he would have done very, very well at Wimbledon because he was hitting the ball so well. World No.3 Roger Federer beat Melbourne-born Mark Philippoussis in the Wimbledon final earlier this month and Fitzgerald said the Australians would be expecting big things from the Swiss. Now that hes broken through for his first Grand Slam hell be very hard to stop from here, Fitzgerald said. Its a difficult ask to beat him, but forms a funny thing. It comes and goes. I hope by September our guys are peaking and Rogers not. The tie takes place between September 19-21 tie at Melbournes Rod Laver Arena.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

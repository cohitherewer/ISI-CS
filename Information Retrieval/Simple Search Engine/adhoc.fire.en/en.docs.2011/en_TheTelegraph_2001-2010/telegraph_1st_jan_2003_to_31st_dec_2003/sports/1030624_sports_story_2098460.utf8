 BRIEFS
 West Indies batsman Sir Vivian Richards set a record for the highest individual score in the 90-year-old Leeward Islands cricket tournament at the Antigua Recreation Ground. Mali Richards, 19, scored 319 while playing for Antigua and Barbuda against the combined us and British Virgin Islands on Day II of the three-day match on Sunday.The left-handed batsmans effort surpassed the previous best of 318 by Alex Adams of Anguilla against the combined Virgin Islands in 1997. Richards gathered his runs from 420 balls in 498 minutes and it contained 22 fours and six sixes.His mother, Miriam Richards, and his sister, were among a small crowd of spectators who watched him achieve the feat. Viv Richards, the chairman of the West Indies selection committee, was in St Lucia where the Frank Rijkaard has signed a multi-year deal with Spanish side Barcelona. He takes over from Serbian coach Radomir Antic who ended a disappointing season on a high note on Sunday, clinching a Uefa Cup berth at the last moment.Rijkaard, 40, was coach of the Dutch team from 1998 to 2000 and Sparta Rotterdam from 2001 to 2002. He becomes the fourth Dutch coach at Barcelona  following Johan Cruyff, Pfaff, who coached Canadas Donovan Bailey to the 100m world record in 1996, is being considered as coach for current record holder Tim Montgomery and his partner triple Olympic champion Marion Jones.Although no contract has been signed, Pfaff, an assistant coach at the University of Texas, has been seen consulting with Montgomery at the US championships, sources said.The 49-year-old Pfaff is a specialist in both sprints and field events, which would help Jones, who has said she would like to compete in both the long jump and sprints scored a hattrick to help Fluminense thump Guarani 5-2 in the Brazilian championship after the visitors had three players sent off and also argued with police over a refereeing decision on Sunday.Police came on to the field in the 85th minute to protect the match officials, who were surrounded by furious Guarani players protesting the award of a penalty to Fluminense. Play was held up for five minutes.When play resumed, Romario completed his hattrick by converting the penalty and Guarani defender Paulao was sent off for dissent.Romario opened his account in the 48th minute with a bicycle kick before adding his second 11 minutes later.Midfielders Zada and Josafa gave Fluminense a 2-0 halftime lead. Marquinhos de Boer is quitting the Spanish club after failing to agree a deal to extend his contract, his lawyers said on Monday. The 33-year-old Dutch internationals contract expired at the end of the season.In contract negotiations today in Barcelona, Frank de Boer and the club were not able to reach an agreement, Amsterdam law firm Hellingman Bunders, which represents the player, said in a statement. After four-and-a-half years Frank de Boer is leaving the club and is looking for another club.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Agarkar for injured Salvi
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Ahmedabad: The national selectors on Sunday recalled Ajit Agarkar to the 14-member squad in place of an injured Avishkar Salvi for the second Test against New Zealand starting in Mohali from Thursday. The selection committee had first met after lunch on the final day and retained the same squad. Later, it came to the selectors knowledge that Salvi had split a webbing on his right hand and required stitches. It meant the fast bowler will be out of action for at least a week. The injury occurred during fielding practice this morning. Salvi had not understood the gravity of the injury till late afternoon when the doctor was called. The selectors were not aware of it during their first meeting, explained BCCI joint secretary Sharad Diwadkar. According to The Telegraphs sources, Sanjay Bangars name was discussed at the first meeting but the selectors felt it was difficult to accommodate him. Akash Chopra has performed well and it will be unfair to drop him, said a selector. There was talk of including him as the 15th member. But the logistics were against Bangar.  THE SQUAD Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Akash Chopra, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman, Parthiv Patel, Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Zaheer Khan, Ajit Agarkar, Yuvraj Singh, Sairaj Bahutule.  Copyright

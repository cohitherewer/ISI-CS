The Telegraph - Calcutta
 $1 million for WTA Tour winner
 St Petersburg: A million-dollar cheque awaits the winner of the WTA Tour championship under a new format to mark the 30th anniversary of the womens tour, the WTA said Wednesday. From this years championship, that takes place on November 5-10 at the Staples Centre in Los Angeles, there will also be a change from the 16-player single elimination singles event to an eight-player round-robin singles tournament with the winner collecting a million dollars. The $1 million winners prize only adds to the intrigue and drama of this unique event and reflects the tremendous growth and success that womens tennis has enjoyed this past year, said WTA Tour president Josh Ripple on Tuesday. The top eight singles players in the WTA Tour championship points standings will qualify for the event. Last season, the title was won by Kim Clijsters, who beat world No. 1 Serena Williams for the $765,000 prize. (AFP)  Copyright

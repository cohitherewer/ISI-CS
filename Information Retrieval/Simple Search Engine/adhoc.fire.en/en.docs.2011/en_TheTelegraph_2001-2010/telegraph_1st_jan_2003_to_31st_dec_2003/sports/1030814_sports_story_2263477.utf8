The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB can win all this year, says PK 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Bhaichung Bhutia takes a look at the trophies on display after inaugurating the East Bengal archives at the club tent on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting technical adviser P.K. Banerjee believes East Bengal have it in them to win all the remaining domestic tournaments this year. They missed out on the Federation Cup but if they remain focussed, they are capable of winning everything, PK said at East Bengals Sports Day to mark the 63rd birth anniversary of the clubs late assistant secretary Dipak Paltu Das. Subhas (Bhowmick) has done a great job in guiding the side to the ASEAN Cup triumph he should forget worrying about the state of grounds and just focus on his boys, PK said. Bhaichung Bhutia opened the East Bengal archives where all the trophies and a ticket of the 1975 IFA Shield final  in which East Bengal trounced Mohun Bagan by a record 5-0 margin  were exhibited. Former East Bengal player Santo Mitra gave his 1970 club blazer and a medallion to be stored in the archive while Bhowmick promised to give all memorabilia he had preserved of the golden 70s era.

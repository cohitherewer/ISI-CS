The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, July 24, 2003  Calamint cashes in on rival tactics 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 Errol				 										Calcutta: Fully exploiting the rival camps tactics, jockey S. Shanker guided trainer Vijay Singhs Calamint to an easy victory in the Mysore Race Club Cup on Wednesday. 				 										It was Daniel Davids Dashing Chief, the 5-2 joint favourite  with the stable-fancy Another Time  who was made a sacrificial goat to draw advantage. Dashing Chief cut a hot-pace that would have suited Another Time and thus, was literally ridden into the ground. However, the ploy never worked as Another Time failed to quicken in the stretch-run and the last winters classic filly just about managed a poor third.				 										If Daniel failed, his former deputy Errol Bhungard had much to collect by way of a rich treble notched up through Flying Dash, Royal Command and Sergeant Slipper in their respective events.

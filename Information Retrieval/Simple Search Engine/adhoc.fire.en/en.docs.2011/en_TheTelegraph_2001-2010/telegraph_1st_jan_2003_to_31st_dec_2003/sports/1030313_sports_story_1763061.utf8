The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I have loads of self-belief
 - Disappointing run behind, Sehwag  promises badla over New Zealand FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Virender Sehwag  Johannesburg: Self-belief,  more than anything else, helped Virender Sehwag get over  a disappointing run till the 66 against Sri Lanka at the  Wanderers. That I couldnt build on the  starts (four scores of 20-plus in seven matches) didnt  frustrate me... Didnt upset me... After all, I have loads  of self-belief and knew I would come good  sooner rather  than later, he remarked at Centurion, Wednesday afternoon. Speaking after the teams workout,  in preparation for Fridays game versus New Zealand, Sehwag  added: Its not right for people to assume I throw my wicket  away. Fact is main shots khelta hoon aur unhi shots mein  out ho jaata hoon... It so happens that the shots which  fetch runs also bring about my downfall... Asked whether he becomes conscious  of Sachin Tendulkar being at the other end, when he takes  guard at the start of the innings, Sehwag answered: Frankly,  I dont look at who is at the other end... I just try to  do my best. Sehwag agreed that the wickets  in the World Cup were pretty similar to the ones back  home. The one real difference, though, has been the bounce. But, then, Sehwag isnt the type  who is much bothered about wickets. And, when on song, doesnt  care about the bowlers either. From my side, respect will  only be there if the bowler deserves it, he pointed out,  smiling. Having done well in the recent  ODIs in New Zealand, Sehwag is ready to again take on the  Shane Bonds. Koshish yehi rahegi ki hum log jeet lein...  Badla lena hai, he said, adding that the SuperSport  Park was Indias favourite ground. While the Indians did thrash Pakistan  in the last engagement there, they were routed by Australia  four weeks ago. Reflecting on that loss, Sehwag promised  that the planning would be better for the next showdown  with Ricky Pontings men. Next time, we will be careful  about which bowlers to take on and which bowlers to play  out, he remarked, confirming that he did have a mature  head. Of course, Sehwag acknowledged that the Australians  were the best in the tournament. Incidentally, though Sehwag is  obviously happy about getting back one of the opening slots,  he has that anything-for-the-team attitude. While Sehwag spoke of badla,  coach John Wright isnt looking to Fridays engagement as  a grudge match. It will be nice to beat New Zealand, but  Im not looking at it as a grudge game... The coach, by the way, didnt  forget to praise Jawagal Srinath. Hes been so consistent...  Hes been an important member of our successful campaign...  That probably is an understatement. Meanwhile, though the Indian XI  is likely to remain the same, a source told The Telegraph  that the batting order could see a change. Its possible  that Mohammed Kaif and Dinesh Mongia will bat at No.3 and  4, respectively, with the captain (Sourav Ganguly) and vice-captain  (Rahul Dravid) batting lower, the source informed. Confirmation should come by Thursday  morning. Copyright

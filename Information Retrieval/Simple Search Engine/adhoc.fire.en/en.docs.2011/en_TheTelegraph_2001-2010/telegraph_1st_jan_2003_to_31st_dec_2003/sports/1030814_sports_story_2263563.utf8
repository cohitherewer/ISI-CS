 Pankaj Advani books berth 
 Advani New Delhi: National champion Pankaj Advani booked his place in the world snooker championship to be played in China in October by thrashing Manan Chandra 5-2 in the semi-final of the selection tournament on Wednesday. The winner of Thursdays semi-final between Asian Games gold medallist and two-time Asian snooker champion Yasin Merchant and Alok Kumar will also book a place at the world meet. The 18-year-old Advani adopted an aggressive approach from the beginning as he played all the shots in his repertoire to completely outplay his opponent.  (PTI)  Copyright

 Coria upsets Moya in semis
Monte Carlo, April 19 (Reuters): Argentine Guillermo Coria upset Carlos Moya 7-6, 6-2 at the Monte Carlo Masters on Saturday, preventing the Spaniard from meeting compatriot Juan-Carlos Ferrero in a repeat of last years final. Earlier, Ferrero, the defending champion, dismissed American Vince Spadea 6-3, 6-4 to win his 11th successive match in the principality. Coria, suspended for six months for nandrolone in 2001, confirmed his great form since the start of the year to reach his fifth career final, his second this season. Coria also took sweet revenge over Moya, who had beaten him in the Buenos Aires final earlier this year. Moya, winner here in 1998, seemed to have the upper hand in the first set, but Coria saved five break points in the 11th game and the former world number one suddenly lost his momentum in the tiebreak which the far more consistent Coria won 7-3.

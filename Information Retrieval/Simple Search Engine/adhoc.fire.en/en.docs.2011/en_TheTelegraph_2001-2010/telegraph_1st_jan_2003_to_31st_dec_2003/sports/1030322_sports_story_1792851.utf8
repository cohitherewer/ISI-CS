 Lehmann: We will be perfect
 Lehmann: Prime form reserved for final Johannesburg: Australia are ready to play their perfect game in the World Cup final against India here Sunday and would not lose just because they have not lost for a very long time, Darren Lehmann said Friday. Throughout the tournament, we have made sure that the final is our perfect game, Lehmann said. Changes in the bowling and batting order, different things up the ground have all been intended to reserve our prime form for the final. Everybody is ready to play the best game they can in the final, he said. Australia have won all their matches in this tournament, extending their unbeaten run to 16 games  a world record. Lehmann, who has played an important part in Australias progress, said winning so many matches in a row does not necessarily mean that a loss was around the corner. You lose a game if you dont play well. Its as simple as that. You dont lose only because you have won for long, Lehmann said but admitted that his team will have to play really well to beat a resurgent India in the final. We are world No 1 and fans expect us to win. But we have to do well to get across the line. And the key to Australias success would obviously depend on how they tackle the Sachin Tendulkar threat. He is a great batter. Hes a great batter for many years  probably the best player in the world. For us we just got to hope we bowl well to him and he makes a mistake, Lehmann said. If he makes mistake we have got to capitalise on it. He makes runs in all conditions. We have just got to put pressure on him, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

 ICC may request new probe in Pak 
Islamabad: Not satisfied with the report of Justice Karamat Nazir Bhandari Commission which had said that Pakistans defeat to Bangladesh and India during the 1999 World Cup were not fixed, the ICC may request for a new probe into the allegations. The ICC may seek another inquiry because submissions from its investigative body  the Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU)  were not included in his report by Justice Bhandari, who was appointed by the Pakistan government to probe into the allegations, Bloomberg news agency quoted a source familiar with the case. However, chairman of PCB Tauqir Zia said that much evidence was not available to establish the allegations.  Its just a misunderstanding in my opinion, Zia said.  (PTI)  Copyright

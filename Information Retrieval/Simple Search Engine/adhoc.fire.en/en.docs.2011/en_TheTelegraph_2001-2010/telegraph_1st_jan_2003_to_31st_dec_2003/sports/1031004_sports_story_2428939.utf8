 Baljit Singh Saini Dhanraj Pillay New Delhi: Captain Dhanraj Pillay along with six others of the Asia Cup winning squad were rested as the Indian Hockey Federation announced 24 probables for the inaugural Afro-Asian Games starting in Hyderabad on October 24. The others to be omitted include Baljit Singh Dhillon, Baljit Singh Saini, Dinesh Nayak, Tejbir Singh, Didar Singh and goalkeeper Kamaldeep Singh. However, the seven have been included in the 31-member probables for the upcoming home Test series against Holland and the Azlan Shah tournament in Malaysia early next year, IHF secretary general K. Jothikumaran said. Though an official reason was not given for Dhanrajs omission, an IHF source said the striker was being rested in view of the other major engagements ahead. Dhanraj later welcomed the decision as it would provide younger players an opportunity to showcase their skills at the highest level. We have been playing for the last eight months. I think it is a right decision to give rest to the seniors, he said. I am very happy the juniors will get a chance to play in the inaugural Afro-Asian Games, the 35-year-old added. The 24 probables for the Afro-Asian Games will attend a training camp starting in New Delhi on October 6. Another camp would be held after the Games for the preparation of the Holland series and the Azlan Shah meet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kothari calls for professionalism 
 - Cueists should give the game top priority  Lack of monetary gains an impediment, says Kothari New Delhi: Indian cueists would have to bring about a sea change in their approach towards the game if they have to bridge the gap between amateur and professional success, according to former world billiards champion Manoj Kothari. I am sorry to say that players look at cue sports as an alternative career instead of giving it top-most priority. With this approach one cannot succeed at the professional level as it requires a lot more dedication and preparation, the Calcutta-based player said on Thursday. Admitting that lack of monetary gains and recognition were the main reasons behind the problem, Kothari, who is in the capital to train the local cueists preparing for the national championship begining next month, said it was essential on the part of the Billiards and Snooker Federation of India to create an atmosphere where professionalism is encouraged. Kothari said this could only happen when the upcoming players are made to believe that they can earn a living only by playing billiards or snooker. Apart from world billiards champion Geet Sethi, whose four of the seven titles have come in the professional circuit, no other Indian cueist can even boast of a satisfactory showing in the big league. Kothari has also been trying to inculcate a scientific approach in coaching by trying to teach the 20-odd trainees the science behind the movement of the ball on the baize. The former champion said he had been working on this aspect since a couple of years. I believe that scientific understanding can lift the performance level of a player by several notches.

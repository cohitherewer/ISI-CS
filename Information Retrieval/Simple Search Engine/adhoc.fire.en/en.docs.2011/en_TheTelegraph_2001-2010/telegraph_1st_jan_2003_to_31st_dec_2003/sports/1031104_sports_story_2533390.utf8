 Lucky I won the toss: Ponting 
 New Zealand allrounder Jacob Oram en route to his swashbuckling 81 in Pune on Monday. (Reuters) Pune: Australian skipper Ricky Ponting on Monday gave credit to the two Michaels (Clarke and Bevan) for the thrilling two-wicket win over New Zealand in the triangular series match here on Monday. I thought we chased pretty well. It is a good effort on our part to restrict New Zealand to 258 and then chase the target even after losing four wickets for 65. The two Michaels batted very well and put us on the right track after adding 108 runs under lot of pressure, Ponting said. I think the toss was a huge factor. Probably if we had batted first, we would have struggled against bowlers like (Darryl) Tuffey and (Jacob) Oram but luckily I won the toss and put them in to bat. In fact, we thought we would get them all out around 150 but Oram and (Brendon) McCullum batted exceedingly well and helped them get a fighting total, he said. The Aussie skipper also praised Man of the Match Brad Williams for his five-wicket haul. Williams bowled exceptionally well and deserved the award. In the end we could make it and I am happy that we are topping the points table. Darryl Tuffey, who attended the press meet in place of skipper Stephen Fleming, blamed the Pune pitch for the teams defeat. We should have good wickets for one-dayers, not this kind of a surface which helped the quick bowlers to do so much. The ball did move for the better part of 25 overs before the track settled down by which time the match was as good as over for us. Thats what happened in Faridabad, thats what happened here, he said.  (PTI)  Copyright

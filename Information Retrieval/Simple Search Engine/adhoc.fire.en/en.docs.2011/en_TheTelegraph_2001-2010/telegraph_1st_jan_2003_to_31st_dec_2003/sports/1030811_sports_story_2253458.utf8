				 																																	Johannesburg: Promising South Africa striker Lesley Manyathela was killed in a car accident on Saturday night, hours after he had scored for his club Orlando Pirates in a cup tie.				 																																	The 21-year-old, who had been on trial at French champions Lyon earlier in the week, died instantly when his car overturned near his home town of Mussina in South Africas northern province, club officials said on Sunday. 				 																																	Manyathela, the leading scorer in South Africas premier league last season, was driving home after playing for the Pirates in a Super Eight Cup quarter final in Johannesburg, where he scored in a 2-1 defeat at Jomo Cosmos.

London: Britains world heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis will take the rest of the year off, but has made no final decision on whether to hang up his gloves for good.

Plans for a rematch in November were immediately proposed. However, they were scuppered by Lewis only last week.				 																																	While he is still undecided about whether to retire from the sport, the 37-year-old says he has no plans to fight again this year. I havent decided if I will retire yet. Nothing is final. But, I do know that I am not going to fight this year, he said.

The defender was taken to a Dublin hospital for x-rays which confirmed a fracture.

The 27-year-old Contra tore ligaments in his  right ankle during a match against Serie A side Roma in  Monterrey. Contra had his leg put in plaster at a Madrid  clinic soon after the teams return.

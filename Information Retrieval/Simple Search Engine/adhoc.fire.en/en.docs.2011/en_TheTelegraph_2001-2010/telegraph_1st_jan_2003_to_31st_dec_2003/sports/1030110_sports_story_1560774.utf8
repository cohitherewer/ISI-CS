		 Friday, January 10, 2003 				 Warnes test match today
				 	 Warne: Hasnt been easy																								Melbourne: Shane Warnes World Cup campaign begins on Friday when he captains Victoria in a one-day match against Western Australia, 26 days after dislocating his shoulder.																								It is a little bit surprising I suppose how quickly its come up, the Australian leg-spinner told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday. Obviously with the World Cup coming up, theres no point playing this early if we werent ready because you wouldnt jeopardise the World Cup.																								Im jumping out of my skin to play. All the movement, my range of movement, all those things are excellent and theres no pain really at all after Ive bowled.																								Warne dislocated his right bowling shoulder while fielding during a one-dayer against England in Melbourne on December 15, casting doubts on whether he would recover in time for the World Cup, starting February 9.																								Warne, Australias leading wicket-taker in Tests and one-day Internationals, had an operation the next day and team officials said his chances of playing in the tournament would depend on how quickly the injury improved.																								The 33-year-old was chosen in Australias 15-man squad for the World Cup after selectors were told they could still replace him if he didnt recover in time, but the Australian management has said he might be rested for the first half of the tournament to save himself for the finals.																								Yesterday we gave it a full-on work out. We did some catching and slips catching and under-arm throwing and just running around the field, Warne said. 																								I bowled 11 or 12 overs yesterday straight. I bowled to a few of the guys and they came out really well. This morning I pulled up no problems.																								Weve put in the hours. It hasnt been easy, its been pretty painful. To get back now and to give myself every chance to be a part of the World Cup, we had to put in a lot of time and a lot of pain. (REUTERS)

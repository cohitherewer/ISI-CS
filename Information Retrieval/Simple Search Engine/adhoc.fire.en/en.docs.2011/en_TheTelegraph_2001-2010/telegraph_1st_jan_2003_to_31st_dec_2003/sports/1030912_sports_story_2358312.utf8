 Ronaldo potshot at Pele record
Manaus (Brazil): World Footballer of the Year Ronaldo has sparked controversy by suggesting that Pele only scored so many goals because Brazils opponents in his era were weaker than modern-day teams. Brazil used to play against teams of regional level players and would win 10-0 with Pele scoring eight goals, Ronaldo said. Unfortunately for me, these matches against regional teams no longer exist. Pele scored 95 goals for Brazil, while Ronaldo currently has 49. Former teammates of Pele said Ronaldo was insulting the man widely considered the greatest player of all time. Ronaldo knows that there are light years between him and Pele, said former Brazil striker Dario Dada Maravilha. Pele is God, hes the king. Ronaldo, 27, said this month he wanted to beat Peles international goal haul.  (AFP)  Copyright

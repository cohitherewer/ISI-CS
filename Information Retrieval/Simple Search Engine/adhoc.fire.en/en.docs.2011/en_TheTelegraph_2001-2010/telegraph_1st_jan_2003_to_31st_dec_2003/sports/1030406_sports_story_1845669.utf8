 Ferguson rubbishes report
London, April 5 (AFP): Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has dismissed out of hand recent reports that David Beckhams days at Old Trafford could be numbered. Why would I want to sell my best players Ferguson told the Daily Mail On Saturday. Last month the England captain was linked to a possible move to Real Madrid, with Spanish giants president Jorge Valdano saying he was European champions next big project. Aside from this, speculation this week in Italy also suggested Inter Milan were contemplating a 32 million swap deal involving Beckham and Inters own Argentinian striker Hernan Crespo. Fuel was added to the fire with Fergusons much-publicised dressing room run-in with Beckham when he kicked a boot at him after Uniteds exit from the FA Cup. Talking about the dressing room bust-up which left Beckham with a nasty cut above his eye, Ferguson said: They happen all the time. I never hold any grudges. The next day we make our peace and the whole thing is forgotten. If I had a pound for every time I had fallen out after a match... The United boss did, however, say that despite Beckhams stature he was still subjected to the same treatment as his Old Trafford teammates.  Copyright

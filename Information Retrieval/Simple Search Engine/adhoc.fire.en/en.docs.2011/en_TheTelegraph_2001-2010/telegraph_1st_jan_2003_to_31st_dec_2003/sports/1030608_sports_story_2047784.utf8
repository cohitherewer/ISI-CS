The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Innings win for England
 Steve Harmison appeals  for leg before against Zimbabwes Dion Ebrahim in Chester-le-Street  Saturday. (Reuters) Chester-le-Street, June 7 (Reuters): Young England fast bowlers James Anderson and Steve Harmison took four wickets each Saturday as a hapless Zimbabwe were again crushed by an innings to lose the two-Test series 0-2. Anderson, who took five wickets on his debut in the first Test, and local boy Harmison had to rely more on sweat than inspiration as Zimbabwe lost by an innings and 69 runs. As at Lords last month, the touring side failed to take the game into a fourth day. Saddled with a 322-run first-innings deficit after being skittled for 94, Zimbabwe resumed on 41 for one and hung about until deep into the final session before being dismissed for 253. It was their ninth defeat in a row, the second worst losing run in Test history. England, meanwhile, last won two successive games by an innings 18 years ago. Anderson and Harmison, widely contrasting players in stature and approach, shared identical figures of four for 55 and six wickets in the match. Debutant seamer Richard Johnson, who claimed six victims in the first innings, failed to add to that tally Saturday. Some good young lads are coming through, England captain Nasser Hussain said. English cricket is doing alright at the moment. When you consider the experience we have lost, all the young bowlers have done well  especially here, where the pitch was flat and slow. It was very un-English and more like the sub-continent. The 20-year-old Anderson, still playing club cricket at the start of last season, has made his name for his ability to swing the ball late and at a skiddy pace.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan meeting ends in chaos
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: There seems to be no end in sight to the Mohun Bagan imbroglio. Fridays meeting called by the Special Officers ended abruptly following an altercation between members of the current executive committee and the dissident group. One of the Special Officers, G.N. Ray, said the meeting was called off as members of the two groups were busy blaming each other. An agreement of sorts has been reached regarding the teams participation in Sundays IFA-organised one-day meet. Coaches Aloke Mukherjee and Atanu Bhattacharya will be the managers for the tournament, Ray said. The deadline for signing players is June 20. Well take a decision on when to sign the remaining players after the one-day meet.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 SA make it 2-2
Rawalpindi: A fine all-round performance by South Africa saw them crush Pakistan by six wickets in the fourth one-day International on Friday. Their victory with 11.1 overs to spare tied the series at 2-2 with the final match on Sunday. South Africas win was built around the bowling of Andre Nel (four for 39) and Makhaya Ntini (three for 25) after Pakistan elected to bat. Chasing 157, Herschelle Gibbs (41 off 46 balls) and Jacques Kallis (58 from 87) ensured the win. Kallis scored his 45th ODI 50 with four fours and two sixes. Shaun Pollock conceded only nine runs in 10 overs. Nel took the wickets of Mohammed Hafeez, Faisal Iqbal, Yousuf Youhana and Younis Khan as Pakistan lost five wickets for 17 in 36 balls.

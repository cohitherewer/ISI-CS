 Sampras may stay away from US Open
 Pete Sampras has retirement on his mind Statekine (Nevada): Pete Sampras plans to withdraw from the US Open, opting not to defend his record 14th major title. His last competitive match was the final of the 2002 Open, where he beat rival Andre Agassi. This season, the 32-year-old Sampras has pulled out of a succession of tournaments, including the majors  the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon. While playing at a celebrity golf tournament at Lake Tahoe this weekend, he told a TV channel: Theres a good chance he will officially retire soon. Not being at the Open this year, which Im going to pull out of, and not playing Wimbledon  I dont miss it enough to really start training, start practising, doing everything I have to do to be where I want to be, Sampras said. So it tells me its a sign to say, its probably time. Sampras has won seven Wimbledons, five US Opens and two Australian Opens.  (AP)  Copyright

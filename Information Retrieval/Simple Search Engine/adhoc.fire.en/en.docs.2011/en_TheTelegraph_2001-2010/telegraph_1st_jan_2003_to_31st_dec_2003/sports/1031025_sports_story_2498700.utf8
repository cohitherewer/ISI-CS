 Saqlain faces disciplinary action
Faisalabad: Pakistan off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq faces disciplinary action after he allegedly misbehaved with coach Javed Miandad and manager Haroon Rasheed, officials said Friday. Saqlain will be appearing before a three-member disciplinary committee headed by Justice (retired) Amir Alam on Wednesday. Its a serious matter and Saqlain has been asked to appear before the disciplinary committee of the PCB on October 29, PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said. We will take a lenient view if he (Saqlain) apologises, keeping in mind his services for the Pakistan cricket, Rameez said. Saqlain was among the eight players dropped from the Pakistan squad after their first-round exit from the World Cup in March this year. He was recalled for the third Test against Bangladesh in Multan last month. When contacted, Saqlain confirmed he would appear before the committee but refused to add further.  (AFP)  Copyright

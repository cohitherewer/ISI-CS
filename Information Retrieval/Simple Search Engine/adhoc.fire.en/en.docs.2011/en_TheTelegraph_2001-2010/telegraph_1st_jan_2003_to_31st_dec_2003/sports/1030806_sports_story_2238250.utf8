The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Club officials manhandle Aloke
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Aloke Mukherjee was heckled and manhandled after Mohun Bagan were shot out of the Federation Cup at Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. As the coach led his players into the dressing-room, he was gheraoed by a section of club officials who demanded explanations on some of the moves he made during the match. Things took a nasty turn when one official rushed to Aloke, pushed and shoved him to one corner. A few more officials joined in the attack on the coach. Some others then turned their attention on goalkeeping coach Atanu Bhattacharya. The players took a few minutes to understand what was happening before intervening. Seniors like Rennedy Singh and Jose Ramirez Barreto took Aloke away, to a safe zone. The officials hurled abuse at the coach. They also accused Basudeb Mondal of being bribed for missing his penalty in the shootout. Aloke said there was always pressure in coaching a big team. When you are out to coach a big team, you must expect frustration coming in from supporters and officials after defeats. You must always have your resignation letter ready. The coach claimed he had the full support of his players. If the officials do not find me fit enough for the job, they should ask me to go.  Copyright

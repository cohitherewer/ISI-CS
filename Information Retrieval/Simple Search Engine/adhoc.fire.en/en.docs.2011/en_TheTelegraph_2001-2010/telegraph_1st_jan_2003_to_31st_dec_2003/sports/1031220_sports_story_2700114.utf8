 Firoz stays ahead of field
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Firoz Ali of Calcutta Friday maintained his overnight lead in the Rs 15 lakh Tata Open being played over the Beldih and Golmuri Club courses. Ali stays a stroke ahead of Vijay Kumar in this tenth leg meet of the Hero Honda Indian Golf Tour. Other Calcutta pros Inderjit Bhalotia and S.S.P. Chowrasia also remained in the hunt with a two-day total of five-under 137 along with Sanjay Kumar from Lucknow, who shares the third position. Firoz, who had set a course record of six-under 66 at the par-72 Beldih course on the opening day, failed to take advantage of a relatively easy Golmuri Course. Making his first birdie on the par-4 second, the 34-year-old pro made three more birdies on the seventh, 11th and 13th. However, he dropped a stroke each on the par-3 15th and the par-5 16th to lose the advantage. Teeing off at the Beldih course, Vijay Kumar made four birdies and an eagle. If it hadnt for the short putts that he missed the Lucknow pro could have avoided the four bogeys. After a birdie on the third, the stocky golfer made consecutive bogeys on the next two holes. However, he made amends on the seventh hole. Meanwhile, Bhalotia who has come back from an injury, was modest said he had lost touch with his long drives.  Copyright

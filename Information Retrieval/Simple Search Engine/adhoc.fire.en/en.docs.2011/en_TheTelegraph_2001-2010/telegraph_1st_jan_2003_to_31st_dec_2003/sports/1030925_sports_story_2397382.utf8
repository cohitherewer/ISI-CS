 Yetunde buried
Los Angeles: The slain sister of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams was buried on Friday in a private ceremony, the family said on Tuesday. Yetunde Price was gunned down on September 14 in the crime-ridden Los Angeles suburb of Compton, not far from where her two youngest sisters first played the game that rocket them to fame. On Friday, September 19, 2003, in Los Angeles, California, the Price/Williams family held private memorial and burial services for their beloved daughter, sister and mother, the late Yetunde Hawanya Tara Price, said the statement, which was released on the same day that a man charged in the shooting was to be arraigned. The Price/Williams family would like to publicly thank their many friends, family, the members of the media, and well wishers for the outpouring of support, affection and kindness shown to them during their tragic loss, it said.

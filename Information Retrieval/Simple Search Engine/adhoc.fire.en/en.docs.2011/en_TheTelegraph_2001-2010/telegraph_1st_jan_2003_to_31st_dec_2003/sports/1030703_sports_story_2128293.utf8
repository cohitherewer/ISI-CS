 No specific charges, says Azhars counsel
Hyderabad: While challenging the inquiry into the match-fixing allegations against Mohammed Azharuddin, the former captains counsel Wednesday told a court here that there were no specific charges against the cricketer. In the absence of a specific charge showing his specific involvement to benefit the other side in a match, he could not put across his evidence, the counsel argued. The investigation was conducted in wilderness, said the counsel, and since Azhar was neither issued a charge memo nor was specifically asked to rebut a particular charge, he was given a raw deal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 27th Serie A title for Juventus
 Alessandro del Piero after the Juventus triumph in Turin Saturday Turin, May 10 (Reuters): Juventus won the Italian title for the second straight year Saturday, a 2-2 draw against Perugia at the Delle Alpi stadium securing their 27th scudetto with two games of the season remaining. Second-placed Inter Milan drew 1-1 with Parma, leaving them eight points adrift of Juventus. Mohammed Kallon gave Inter a 36th minute lead, but it was neutralised by Adrian Mutu in the 63rd minute. An injury-time equaliser by Perugias Fabio Grosso slightly took the gloss off the occasion after Marco Di Vaio had put Juventus 2-1 up a minute into the second half. Perugias Fabrizio Miccoli had cancelled out David Trezeguets 25th-minute opener from the penalty spot.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vettori hits maiden ton
 Daniel Vettori after his century in Hamilton on Saturday Hamilton, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Records tumbled as New Zealand piled up a huge first-innings total of 563 on the second day of the first Test against Pakistan on Saturday. Pakistan, in reply, were 118 for two at stumps with Yasir Hameed on 36 and Yusuf Youhana on 24 after Imran Farhat and Taufeeq Umar had put on a quickfire 47 for the first wicket. Farhat hit four fours before he was caught-behind by Robbie Hart off Jacob Oram for 20. Umar thumped five fours in his 27 before mistiming a pull off Daryl Tuffey and skying the ball to Ian Butler at short mid-wicket with the total on 55. Earlier, Stephen Fleming made 192 and Daniel Vettori 137 not out to give the Black Caps a huge total. Their partnership of 125 was a New Zealand record for the eighth wicket against Pakistan, beating Bryan Yuile and Dayle Hadlees stand of 100 in Karachi in 1969. Skipper Flemings innings took 478 minutes and he hit 31 fours. He figured in three century partnerships and never looked in danger until he was trapped lbw by Umer Gul. Vettori registered his first Test century, batting for 163 minutes and cracking 23 fours and a six.  Copyright

 Jawagal Srinaths commitment impresses Gauteng board Durban: Pace spearhead Jawagal Srinath, who had a wonderful World Cup, is all set for another trip to South Africa in September  this time to help with the development of fast bowlers. The 33-year-old Karnataka bowler, who has entered into a contract with the Gauteng Cricket Board (GCB) in Johannesburg, will help with the development of fast bowlers in the province and would tutor a large group of youngsters in the art of fast bowling. Besides coaching, Srinath, scheduled to arrive here in mid-September, would also play for the Highveld Strikers Cricket Club. GCB CEO Alan Kourie said Srinath had impressed the board with his commitment to the game and he would be an asset in the boards development programme. Srinath has been around for some time and during the World Cup he showed that he is still in good nick, said Kourie. He also said Srinath was a perfect gentleman and would fit into the Gauteng scheme of things. Srinath is currently in England where he is playing for Durham.  (PTI)  Copyright

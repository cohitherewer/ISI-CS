The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Saturday, December 20, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Oakland (California): Andy Roddick will play in the Olympic tennis tournament this summer.				 																																	Athens 2004  were definitely going, Roddicks coach, Brad Gilbert, said on Thursday. The top-ranked Roddick is eligible for the summer Games because he plays in Davis Cup competition. The Olympics are scheduled for August 15-22, ending eight days before the start of the US Open, where Roddick will defend his first major title.				 																																	I was with Andre when he won gold in 96 in Atlanta, and I played on the team in Seoul in 88, Gilbert said. It was a great experience.				 																																	London: Jos Verstappen will not race for Minardi in Formula One next year, the Dutch drivers major sponsor confirmed on Thursday.				 																																	The announcement by Dutch technology company Trust followed Minardis decision on Wednesday to offer Hungarian Zsolt Baumgartner the drive and reported talks between Verstappens management and the Jordan team. Jos Verstappen will not be on the grid for the Minardi F1 team in the 2004 Formula One season, the company said.				 																																	Winnipeg: Canadas cross-country skier Beckie Scott made history on Thursday by becoming the first Olympic athlete to be awarded bronze, silver and gold medals in the same event. Scott accomplished the feat 22 months after the race when the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) stripped Russias Olga Danilova of her gold medal in the 5 km event at the 2002 Salt Lake Olympics after a series of doping rulings.				 																																	Scott, originally the bronze medallist, had already been upgraded to silver earlier this year when the IOC disqualified second-placed Russian Larissa Lazutina after a positive doping test. Both Danilova and Lazutina tested positive for the banned blood-boosting substance darbepoetin. 				 																																	Amsterdam: Former World Player of the Year Marco van Basten says Dutch players should stop behaving like movie stars if they want to perform well at next years European Championship in Portugal.				 																																	The former Ajax and AC Milan striker, whose playing career was ended by an ankle injury in 1995, criticised the attitude of the current Netherlands players.				 																																	A lot will depend of the atmosphere in the squad. Order and discipline, that is often the problem in Holland. Players have to go to Portugal as sportsmen and not as superstars, Van Basten said.				 																																	Some of the players behave like movie stars and that has to be handled directly. You are going for honour and country. Players should convince me that they are only thinking about soccer.				 																																	London: Five-times Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong has said he is likely to race twice more in the sports most prestigious event.				 																																	I will probably run two more Tours de France in 2004 and 2005, the American was quoted as saying on his personal website on Thursday. The team is in place and our preparation out of season has gone well.				 																																	The 32-year-old Armstrong will bid for a record sixth Tour next year. He joined cyclings most select club when he claimed his fifth victory in July, matching the feat of Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain. 				 																																	London: Wimbledons famed Centre Court could be getting a roof after all. At least a sliding one.				 																																	The All-England Club has called a news conference for January 6 to announce innovative plans for the Centre Court of the future.				 																																	Several newspapers have decided that means the club has finally agreed to build a roof over the famous arena to bring an end to all those frustrating rain delays.				 																																	The club didnt want to elaborate on its announcement of a news conference but it wasnt dismissing the reports either. This is just speculation at this stage, said a spokesman in anonymity. All will be revealed on January 6. Wimbledon chairman Tim Phillips said before  the last championships in June that the club was looking  at the chances of building some kind of a roof. We know  that it is physically possible to build a roof as has happened  elsewhere, he said. Sport on Screen Cricket, India vs Australia A, Day II  live from 5.30 am on ESPN

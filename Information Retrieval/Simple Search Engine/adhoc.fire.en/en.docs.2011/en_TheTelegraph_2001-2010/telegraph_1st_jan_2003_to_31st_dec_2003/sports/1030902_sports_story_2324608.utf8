 Rain spoils Kapils session
Bangalore: The six-day preparatory camp for the Indian probables got off to a wet start on Monday with sharp showers forcing them indoors. Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh and Mohammed Kaif, who missed the first leg of the camp last month due to their county engagements, joined the probables at the M. Chinnaswamy stadium. The others joining the camp were Aakash Chopra, Ramesh Powar and Sairaj Bahutule. However, Kapil Dev, who was to pass on tips to fast bowlers, could not interact much due to the rain-enforced interruption. Media personality Prannoy Roy also delivered a lecture to the probables later in the evening. Former world billiards champion Geet Sethi and former All England Badminton champion Prakash Padukone will also share their experiences along the course of the camp which concludes on Saturday. Yoga guru B. K. S. Iyengar will interact with the probables on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the a three-member committee of the BCCI discussed the proposed annual contracts of the players with four seniors  captain Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Kumble and Dravid. We discussed the contract. The (discussion) process has just started and it will continue. No decision has been taken so far, BCCI secretary S. K. Nair said.  (PTI)  Copyright

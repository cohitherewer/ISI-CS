The Telegraph - Calcutta
 McGrath doubtful for first Test
 McGraths recovery has been slow Melbourne, Oct. 4 (Reuters): Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath is doubtful for next weeks first Test against Zimbabwe after struggling to regain full fitness following ankle surgery. The lanky paceman said he had suffered soreness in his left ankle after training on the hard practice wickets in Perth. Obviously it would be better if I played totally pain-free. Thats what were trying to aim for now, McGrath said. I dont think Ill go into this Test if theres a chance I wont make it through. Im a little bit unhappy with the way its gone today, the 33-year-old added. I was hoping it would be a lot better. With the bowls Ive had back in Sydney its felt really good and I couldnt (have been) happier.  McGraths likely absence will leave quick bowlers Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie in charge of the new-ball attack with regular back-up Andy Bichel expected to win a recall as first-change. McGrath said he was keen to pace himself over the season.  Id like to go into this season 100 percent. If its too much less than that then theres no real point, McGrath said.  Copyright

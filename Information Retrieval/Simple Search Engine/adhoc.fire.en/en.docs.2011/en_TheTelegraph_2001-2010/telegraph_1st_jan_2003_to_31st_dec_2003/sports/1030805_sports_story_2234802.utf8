 Quickfire 69 by Dravid
London: Rahul Dravid scored 69 off 79 balls to guide Scotland to their first victory in the National League in Hove on Sunday. Dravids fourth-wicket stand of 167 with Joe Kent helped Scotland register a six-wicket victory over Sussex, who made 269. Scotland were 57 for three when Dravid came in. The elegant right-hander built up the innings with Kent, who made 115 off 113 balls with 13 fours and a six. Dravid struck seven fours. Yuvraj Singh make only five for Yorkshire in their total of 183 as the county lost to Gloucestershire. (PTI)  Copyright

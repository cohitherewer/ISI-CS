The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Newcastle edge past Chelsea
London: Olivier Bernard kept Newcastle Uniteds league title bid on track on Saturday when he grabbed their winner in a 2-1 victory over Chelsea. Chelseas Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink headed a spectacular own goal in the 31st minute, while Frank Lampard volleyed a quick equaliser in the clash at St James Park. But the French defenders 53rd minute strike moved third-placed Newcastle on to 55 points, level with Manchester United and five behind champions Arsenal, who play Charlton Athletic on Sunday. Everton leapfrogged Chelsea into fourth place on 49 points after a 1-1 draw at Middlesbrough, where Boros World Cup winning midfielder Juninho scored the equaliser as a second-half substitute on the Brazilians debut after knee surgery. Blackburn Rovers edged Manchester City 1-0 with a David Dunn goal for their third League win on the trot. In the relegation battle, West Ham United notched a second consecutive win by beating Tottenham Hotspur 2-0 in the London derby but West Bromwich Albion were beaten 1-0 at Southampton by James Beatties 19th goal of the season and Sunderland slumped to a 1-0 defeat by Fulham.

 England need a Murali: Hussain
London: Former England skipper Nasser Hussain said on Friday that the national teams prospects would be vastly improved if they could find a magician like Muttiah Muralidharan. Hussain, who stepped down as captain in July, said Englands lack of quality spin bowlers was a real area for concern and that more should be done to produce our own Muralidharan. We need a real magician with the ball to make us a much better side.  Hussains comments came after suggestions from his predecessor Michael Vaughan that the number of County championship games should be reduced in order to preserve the effectiveness of the national team. Angus Fraser, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick could all have gone on to take 400 wickets for England, he said. But they bowled so much in the nets and for their Counties that they wasted balls they could have been bowling for England. (AFP)  Copyright

 United beat Arsenal 
Cardiff: New goalkeeper Tim Howard saved two spot kicks as Manchester United beat Arsenal 4-3 on penalties to win the Community Shield on Sunday. After the scores had been tied 1-1 after extra time, the traditional Premier League curtain raiser went to penalties. After both Howard and new Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann saved spot kicks, the American made the decisive save from Arsenal star midfielder Robert Pires as the Reds won their first title since the departure of England captain David Beckham. Mikael Silvestre gave Manchester United the lead in the 15th minute. The French defender headed down a Ryan Giggs corner which had been flicked on at the near post by United captain Roy Keane. Lehmann was left stranded.Arsenal levelled four minutes later, through a Thierry Henry free-kick. Henrys 30 yard shot curved inside the right hand post past a diving Howard.  (AFP)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Akhtar Ali upset
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Aug. 23: Former Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali expressed his disappointment over Zeeshan Alis exclusion from the Arjuna Awardees list. I know the AITA strongly recommended Zeeshans name for the third time. We were expecting he would surely be awarded this year But again he has been left out. I think this is sheer injustice, Akhtar said. Even Sandeep Kirtane got it last year. Dont you think Zeeshan is more deserving? Akhtar attended a gathering at South Club to wish Leander Paes a speedy recovery. Arun Lal, Chuni Goswami and Anwar Ali were also present.  Copyright

 Back injury lays Becks down for 72 hours
Madrid: Real Madrid star David Beckham has been told to rest for 72 hours owing to a lower back injury, the team said in a statement posted on its web-site. News reports Tuesday said Beckham sustained the injury during Real Madrids league trouncing by Sevilla on Sunday. Madrid have left him off their squad for an exhibition game against Valladolid. The Spanish club didnt say whether the injury would cause him to miss Englands friendly match against Denmark on Sunday, although reports said he should be fit to play. If Beckham recovers in time, he is expected to captain his national side at Old Trafford. The match will be the star midfielders second at the home of his former club Manchester United since he joined Madrid in June. The first came in Englands 2-0 victory over Liechtenstein in a Euro 2004 qualifier in September. Last month, Beckham missed two of Madrids league games with a right hamstring injury.

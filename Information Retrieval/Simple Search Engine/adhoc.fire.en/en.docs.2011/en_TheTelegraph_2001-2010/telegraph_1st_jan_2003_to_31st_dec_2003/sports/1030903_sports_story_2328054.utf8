The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barretos close shave 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Barreto survived run-in with a tram Calcutta: Mohun Bagans Brazilian striker Jose Ramirez Barreto had a narrow escape when his car was hit by a tram here on Tuesday. Though he escaped unhurt, Barretos car was badly damaged, the police said. The incident took place at the crossing of Kidderpore Road and Casuarina Avenue at around 1.20pm as he was returning home after attending a function. Barreto had earlier practised at the Mohun Bagan ground. According to the police, Barreto, who was driving, thought the tram would stop as he was crossing the tracks. But the tram didnt and hit the Brazilians car on the left. The initial alarm at the Mohun Bagan tent gave way to a sigh of relief after news came through that Barreto was unhurt, that too just two days before the Derby match against arch-rivals East Bengal. Bagans assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury later met the player at his residence. It was as much a close call for Barreto as for us. Had we missed him against East Bengal, it would have been a big blow for us, he said.  Copyright

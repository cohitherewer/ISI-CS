The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Andy Roddick sweeps to victory
London: Andy Roddick swept to his first grasscourt title on Sunday, thrashing Sebastien Grosjean 6-3, 6-3 to win the Stella Artois meet at Queens Club. The American, possessor of the fastest serve in tennis and conqueror of Andre Agassi in the semi-final, took just 59 minutes to wipe the Frenchman off the court. Theyre not joking around here, Roddick smiled as he was handed the enormous silver cup. That things bigger than I was when I was 12-years-old. Roddick pocketed $111,300 for the one-sided victory . It is great, he said. I will relax now and then come back in a weeks time and try to do it all over again at Wimbledon. A single break in the first set was enough for the American to clinch it at Queens Club. The third seed broke for 4-2 in the opening set when, having clawed his way back from love-40, Grosjean double-faulted. A second break for 2-1 in the second put Roddick firmly on the path to victory, one he completed when he broke again for 6-3, winning match point on a lucky netcord.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

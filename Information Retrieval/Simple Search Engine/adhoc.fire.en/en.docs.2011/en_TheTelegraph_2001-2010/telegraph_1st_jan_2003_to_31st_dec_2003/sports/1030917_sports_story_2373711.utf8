The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Contractor accuses trio of conspiracy
 - Ex-captain raps Sunny, Dilip, Brijesh after losing NCA post  Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar amp; Brijesh Patel Mumbai: Former India captain Nari Contractor on Tuesday slammed the National Cricket Academy (NCA) committees decision to replace him with Ashok Mankad as talent resources development officer (TRDO) from West Zone at a recent meeting in Bangalore. Contractor said he firmly believes NCA director Brijesh Patel, Sunil Gavaskar and Indian cricket boards chief TRDO Dilip Vengsarkar had ganged up to oust him from the post. His ouster comes in the wake of what he believes was a casual conversation with Gavaskars childhood friend Milind Rege at a recent function. Over there, he questioned Rohan Gavaskars inclusion in the India A team for the tour of England. He also questioned Brijeshs son Udit Patels selection for the Border-Gavaskar scholarship. My ouster had nothing to do with age. In fact, when Dilip met me before the NCA meeting in Bangalore he had confirmed that I will be the TRDO and he wanted to know whether I could spare more time after it was decided to have just three TRDOs this year instead of six. If age was the reason then how come former Mumbai spinner Padmakar Shivalkar, who is 62, is chosen as the second TRDO, ahead of the 45-year-old Kiran Mokashi, said Contractor.  When contacted, Gavaskar declined  to comment. (PTI)  Copyright

 Dutch agree to play 3 Tests vs India 
New Delhi: India will finally get a chance to lock horns with Olympic hockey champions The Netherlands at home in February next year, but it will be a three-Test affair instead of five as planned earlier. The three Tests will be played in Hyderabad on February 5, 7 and 8, a source in the Indian Hockey Federation said Sunday. The dates have been confirmed by the IHF and its Dutch counterpart, he said. It would be the first time in 26 years that India would be hosting the European giants in a one-to-one series. The Netherlands were originally scheduled to play five Tests in late January but the series had to be put off. The Dutch team was thrown into turmoil after six senior players boycotted their chief coach Joost Bellaart, who resigned at the end of October.Bellaart has been replaced by former Australian player and national coach Terry Walsh.

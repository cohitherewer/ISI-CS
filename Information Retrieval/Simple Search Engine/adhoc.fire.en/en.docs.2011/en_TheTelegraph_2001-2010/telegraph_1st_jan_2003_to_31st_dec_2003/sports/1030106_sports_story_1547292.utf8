				 																																	New Delhi: The Indian under-19 hockey team blanked arch-rivals Pakistan 2-0 in their first league match of a four-nation Asian hockey tournament at Kuala Lumpur Sunday.				 																																	The well-contested match saw India outplay Pakistan in every department of the game, according to information received here.				 																																	The other teams in the fray are Malaysia and South Korea. 				 																																	Seoul: Former Portugal coach Humberto Coelho is to take charge of South Korea.				 																																	The Korea Football Association said it hoped Coelho would sign a contract by the end of January after it chose him ahead of rival candidate Bruno Metsu, who led Senegal to the World Cup quarter finals last year.				 																																	South Korea, the tournament co-hosts with Japan, reached the last four of the World Cup under Guus Hiddink before he opted to return to his native The Netherlands to head club PSV Eindhoven. 				 																																	Coelhos first match in charge is due to be a friendly against Colombia, in Korea on March 29.				 																																	Asuncion: Charismatic Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, who has not played since an acrimonious split with French club Racing Strasbourg in September, has joined Cerro Porteno, the Asuncion-based club said on Saturday.				 																																	The volatile goalkeeper, a free-kick and penalty specialist who has scored more than 50 goals in club and international football, returns to play in his own country after an absence of 17 years.				 																																	In principle, he will join us for one year, said club president Cesar Luis Puente, who added that Chilavert would boost his clubs attempt to win the South American Libertadores Cup for the first time.				 																																	Montevideo: South America, still seething after losing half a place in the 2006 World Cup finals, said on Saturday they would formally ask Fifa to reconsider its decision and questioned whether Africa deserved to have five places.				 																																	A meeting of the South American Football Confederation (CSF) voted to propose staging a four-way playoff between teams from Europe, South America, Asia and the Concacaf (North and Central America and the Caribbean) for the final place at the tournament in Germany.				 																																	They will put the suggestion to footballs world governing body Fifa in March.				 																																	Montevideo: Fiery Uruguayan striker Richard Morales is set to join Spanish first division Osasuna.				 																																	A source at his Nacional club said on Saturday that Morales, who has twice ended up in police custody for fighting in the last two years, will sign a three-year contract. 				 																																	The 27-year-old spent most of the qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup as a reserve until he came off the bench to score twice in the 3-0 win over Australia which took Uruguay to their first finals since 1990.				 																																	Two years ago, Morales, who has won 15 caps for his country and scored six goals, was one of nine players who spent a week in police custody for brawling at the end of a Penarol and Nacional derby.				 																																	Several weeks later, he was again detained by police following a brawl in a nightclub.				 																																	Morales has scored 69 goals in 177 games during his three years with Nacional. 				 																																	n Cricket, Australia vs England  Fifth Test, Day V, second session live from 8 am on STAR Sports n Soccer, English Premier League  Arsenal vs Chelsea from 5 pm on ESPN n Cricket, New Zealand vs India  Fourth ODI, highlights from 9 pm on ESPNn Kapil Dev and ace shooter Jaspal Rana after an exhibition match during the Durand Cup in New Delhi on Sunday

 Bagan in control as Utpal bags 5 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Utpal Chatterjee bowled Mohun Bagan to a strong position on the opening day of the J.C. Mukherjee Trophy final against Tollygunge Agragami at Eden Gardens Monday. The veteran left-arm spinner took five for 39 to bundle out Tollygunge for 174 after they had won the toss and elected to bat. Srikant Kalyani top-scored for Tollygunge with 42. Mohun Bagan knocked 25 runs off the target in the remaining 14 overs without losing a wicket, which means they need 150 on the final day to win their third title of the season. They have already bagged the CAB League and the A.N. Ghosh Trophy. BRIEF SCORES Tollygunge Agragami 174 in 75.5 ovs (Srikant Kalyani 42, Abhijit Ganguly 35, Devang Gandhi 32, Utpal Chatterjee 5/39).

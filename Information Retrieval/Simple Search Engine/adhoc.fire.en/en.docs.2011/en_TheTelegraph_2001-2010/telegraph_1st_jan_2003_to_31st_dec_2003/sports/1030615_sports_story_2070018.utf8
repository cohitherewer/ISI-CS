The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Roddick beats Agassi 
London, June 14 (Reuters): Andy Roddick ripped apart Andre Agassis baseline game and unloaded the fastest-ever serve on Saturday to reach the final of the Stella Artois Championships at Queens Club. Roddick had never beaten the newly-crowned world No. 1 in four previous attempts but he was irrepressible on Saturday and triumphed 6-1, 6-7, 7-6. You try to serve fast out there, Roddick said, referring to the record 149 miles (239.8 km) per hour rocket he fired off in the second set. But not for the speed gun, to get it past the best returner of all time. It feels good to have won that. This week has been my best week for sure on grass. Roddick will face either Britains Tim Henman or Sebastien Grosjean of France in Sundays final. Roddick started the match in explosive style. On the very first point, the 20-year-old walloped a 139 miles (223.7 km) per hour ace past his fellow American  the first of 27 he hit during the match. It was clear Agassi would not be allowed to enjoy his latest stint as the oldest world No. 1. Instead Roddick ran him ragged on the Queens Club grass court, pumping winners left, right and centre to reel off the first set in just 20 minutes. In the second game of the second set, the courtside speed gun showed Roddick to have hit the fastest serve on record, a 149 miles (239.8 km) per hour thunderbolt equalling the record set by Britains Greg Rusedski in Indian Wells five years ago. Agassi did return it, though, and managed to crack a smile about it afterwards. I got it back? Hey... sounds like I got some sort of record there too, then, he said.  Copyright

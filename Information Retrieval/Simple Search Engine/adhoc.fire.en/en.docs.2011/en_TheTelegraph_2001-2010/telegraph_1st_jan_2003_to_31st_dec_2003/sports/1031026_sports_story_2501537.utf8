The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Uzbekistan advance
Hyderabd, Oct. 25 (PTI): Uzbekistan defeated Burkina Faso 1-0 and Zimbabwe held Iran 1-1 in group B of the Afro-Asian football competition today. Uzbekistan thus booked their place in the semi-finals while Burkina Faso are out of contention after suffering their second straight loss. Zimbabwe, with a win and a draw, stand a better chance to take the other last-four berth. Captain Yaroslav scored the winner in the 66th minute off a pass from Alexander Geynrikh. Burkina played well, but had only themselves to blame for losing after missing a series of easy chances. Zimbabwe scored in the first minute, through the opportunistic Ronaldo Badza. Iran dominated proceedings thereafter and drew level in the 56th minute through a Seyed Jalal penalty. Iran have an outside chance to reach the knockout stage. They have to defeat Burkina Faso by a huge margin and hope Uzbekistan beat Zimbabwe.  Copyright

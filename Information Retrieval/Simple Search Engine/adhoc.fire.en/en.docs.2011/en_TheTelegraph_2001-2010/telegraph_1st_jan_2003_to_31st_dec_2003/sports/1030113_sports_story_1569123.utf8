		 Monday, January 13, 2003 				 Palmeiras guilty, says AIFF report
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: The 2002 IFA Shield final imbroglio has carried on well past a year with AFC banning AIFF from hosting any tournament with foreign teams.																								But the AIFF fact-finding committee, which included former Chief Justice of India Ranganath Mishra and senior advocate and MP R.K. Anand, have blamed Palmeiras for causing the trouble in the final in their report submitted in December.																								Palmeiras caused the disturbance... And, therefore, the match could not be played or continued to get an appropriate conclusion, the report said.																								After the match was abandoned with Palmeiras leading 1-0, IFA had awarded the trophy to East Bengal.																								The committee also rubbished Palmeiras allegation that there was nobody to give us proper security and ask us to keep playing the game in their complaint a day after the final. 																								IFA joint secretary Ranjit Gupta informed that AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi will sit with the AFC officials on January 23 to resolve the matter.																								We have also demanded compensation from Palmeiras for not bringing the best team, which they promised to do, for the meet, Gupta informed. Palmeiras had taken the appearance money on that basis and we feel cheated, he added.																								Shield in July																								The IFA Shield, scheduled for July is likely to be the seasons curtain-raiser event from this year, Gupta informed.

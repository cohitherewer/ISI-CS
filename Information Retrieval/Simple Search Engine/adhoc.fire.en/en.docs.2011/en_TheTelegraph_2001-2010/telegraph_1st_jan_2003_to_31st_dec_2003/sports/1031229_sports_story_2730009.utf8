The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Becks 3m Posh salvage package
 London: Soccer star David Beckham is indeed  desperate to save his marriage as he presented Christmas  gifts worth 3 million to his wife Victoria, a tabloid claimed  here Sunday. Beckhams gifts included a 1 million yacht to Victoria  to salvage their troubled marriage, the News of the World  reported. Besides the 50 feet yacht, the football star has bought her a 140,000 super car  thought to be a Bentley  as a Christmas present from sons Brooklyn and Romeo. This is on top of the 1.5 million diamond ring he gave her last month and another worth  500,000 that she flashed at his Buckingham Palace OBE ceremony, the paper said. Quoting a source close to the Beckhams, it said: The marriage has been through the mill and David is desperate to keep his family together. Buying Victoria the boat means they can all get together right away from pressures and relax.  Hes been looking at getting one for ages but only  finally decided a few weeks ago.  (PTI)  Copyright

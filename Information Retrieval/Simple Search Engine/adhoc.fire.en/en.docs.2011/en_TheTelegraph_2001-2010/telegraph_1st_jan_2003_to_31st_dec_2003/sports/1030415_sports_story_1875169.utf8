The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India B upset China
Jodhpur: Led by GM Koneru Humpy, India B stunned top seed China with a 2.5-1.5 win in the seventh round of the Asian team chess meet here on Monday. As a result of this brilliant onslaught by the hosts and a 4-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka, the men in India A found themselves at the top of the table. With two rounds remaining, the leaders are a full point ahead of China on 17.5 while the third place is held jointly by fourth seed Kazakhstan and seventh seed India C on 17 points each. India Bs sensational win took them to fifth position, on 16.5 points and put them within striking distance of a medal. After India Bs tremendous triumph, the proverbial icing on the cake was IM Lanka Ravi who made his maiden GM norm after beating Malaysian Nicholas Chan. As per Fide regulations, players need at least nine games to get a norm. The lead positions in the womens section, however, remained unchanged and the Chinese girls continued to be at the top even though they dropped a point against Iran when world junior girls champion Wang Yu suffered a shock defeat to Mahini Mona. This gave a chance to Vietnam and India A to inch closer to China after they defeated Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh by an identical 3-0 margin. Vietnam took its tally to 14.5, one point adrift of the leader while India A moved to 14. Like India A, the B team also scored a thumping 3-0 win over Sri Lanka while India C defeated Malaysia 2.5-0.5.  (PTI)  Copyright

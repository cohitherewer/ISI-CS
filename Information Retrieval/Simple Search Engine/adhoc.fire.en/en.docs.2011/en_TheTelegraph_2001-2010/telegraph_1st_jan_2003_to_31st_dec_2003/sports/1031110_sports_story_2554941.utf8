The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak to host Asia Cup after tour by India
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dalmiya has been assured Indias dues will be cleared in 4-6 weeks Calcutta: The Asia Cup will take place in Pakistan after Indias tour of the neighbouring country in March-April next year. Talking to reporters on Sunday, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said: Six teams will take part in the tournament which will be held in Pakistan after the tour by India. The tournament will feature four Test playing nations  India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and two qualifiers from the ACC Trophy. However, the detailed itinerary is yet to be worked out. The itinerary for the Asia Cup as well as for the tour by India will be worked out shortly, Dalmiya added. India will leave for Pakistan in the last week of February following a two-week rest after they return from Australia. Meanwhile, Ehsan Mani, the ICC president has made it clear that he was misquoted by a section of the media on the issue of releasing Indias share of the guarantee money for the World Cup earlier this year. In a letter addressed to Dalmiya dated November 7, the ICC president confirmed that the money will be released within four to six weeks. The decision was taken in a meeting in Barbados last week. It may be recalled that the IDI (the commercial arm of the ICC) had withheld Indias dues worth $6.5 million following compensation claims raised by GCC/WSN. However, according to Dalmiya, the money will be released on two conditions. Each of the ten ICC full members would furnish a personal indemnity (and not bank guarantee) if the GCC succeeds in any of its claim with the IDI and that each full member will pay 1/10th of the amount of liability to GCC, Dalmiya said. He also informed that if a GCC claim has to be settled across the table, a panel of experts would determine the liability of the individual boards and its decision will be final. PTI adds from Islamabad: The PCB has welcomed Indias confirmation on touring Pakistan. PCB chief executive Rameez Raja said it is a very positive step and added it would give a big boost to efforts to normalise relations between the two countries. The PCB wants to host three Tests and seven ODIs. The tentative programme has already been sent to the BCCI, Raja said. People really want to see India-Pakistan matches at home as they have not taken place for a number of years. In return we are ready to play as many matches when we visit India in February 2005, he said. The PCB, however, has not suggested any venues and they will be finalised after consultations with the BCCI.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Now or Never theme for Souravs boys
Lehmann and Bevan certain to figure in Australian XI against India FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Michael Bevan during practice at Centurion Park in Pretoria Thursday. (AFP) Pretoria: Now or Never is the Indians theme for the World Cup, but for it to click like the Australians No Regrets Tour in 1999, much work needs to be put in. Towards that end, the Indians were at nets in neighbouring Centurion, Thursday afternoon, hours after completing a tiring Paarl-Cape Town-Johannesburg-Pretoria trip.But, then, so much is at stake  and the next Pool A match is against holders Australia  that the luxury of an off cant even be contemplated. In any case, coach John Wright is a demanding taskmaster.The coach, however, made an exception for Jawagal Srinath, Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan.

Now, that isnt so, but curator Hilbert Smith maintained every effort has been made to bring back the bounce and carry.The track, by the way, is devoid of grass and has the shine usually associated with good batting wickets.Warne issueMeanwhile, a well-placed source informed that the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) is unsure whether the Event Technical Committee will sanction a replacement for the No.1 leggie. Shanes departure had nothing to do with an injury, so... Its probably going to be a tricky call, the source remarked.If a replacement is okayed, young Nathan Hauritz is bound to be a contender.

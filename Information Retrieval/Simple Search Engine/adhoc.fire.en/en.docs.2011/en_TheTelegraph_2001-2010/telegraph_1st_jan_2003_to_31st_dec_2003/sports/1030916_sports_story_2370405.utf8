The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCSL is now Sri Lanka Cricket
Colombo: Sri Lankas cricket board has adopted a new name in an attempt to separate its administrative and commercial operations and enhance profits. At a special general meeting on Sunday, the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) voted to change its name to Sri Lanka Cricket. A commercial arm named Sri Lanka Cricket Incorporated has also been set up with regard to the business interests of the game and to qualify for duty free concessions granted to companies with Board of Investment (BOI) approval. The BOI recognised companies are offered tax incentives to boost their foreign exchange earnings. The Sri Lankan cricket board earns foreign exchange from international tours as well as by selling television and sponsorship rights. The changes came ahead of Englands tour featuring three Tests, three ODIs and warm-up matches starting November 15. Recently, the Australian cricket board also changed its name to Cricket Australia.

 BCCSL spells out pay contract 
Colombo: The Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) slashed player salaries by 30 per cent and introduced new performance related incentives for the national team Saturday. The BCCSL also reduced the number of players on central contracts from 15 to 12. The cutbacks reflect the tightening purse strings of the BCCSL, which announced a $ 2.7 million financial loss for 2002 earlier in the week. The 12 contracted players have been given only 70 per cent of last years base salary but will receive an additional $500 for each win as well as a match fee bonus. The match fee for Tests ($1,750) and ODIs ($1,250) will be increased by 50 per cent for a win against one of the top four ranked sides and 25 per cent against the fifth to eighth best teams. This incentive based remuneration package is equitable and was acceptable to the players, said BCCSL chairman Hemaka Amarasuriya. (Reuters)  Copyright

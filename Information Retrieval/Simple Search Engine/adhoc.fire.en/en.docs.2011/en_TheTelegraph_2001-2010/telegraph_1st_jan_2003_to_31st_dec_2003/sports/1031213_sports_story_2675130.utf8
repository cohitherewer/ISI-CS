The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I miss Zimbabwe: Andy
 - Former captain hopes to make a trip back to his homeland  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Andy expects the Indians to do well in the four-Test series  Adelaide: Andy Flower doesnt regret the (unprecedented)  black armband protest during this years World Cup, but  still does miss Zimbabwe. Henry Olonga, it may be recalled,  had joined in making a statement against the murder of  democracy.  Oh, I miss friends... Miss my  teammates... Actually, I miss Zimbabwe, Andy told The  Telegraph during a brief chat on Friday morning. The  one-time captain, among the finest players of spin, left  after the quadrennial showpiece and is currently doing duty  for South Australia. Just a shade emotional, the 35-year-old Andy added: I will definitely make a trip back to Zimbabwe but, at the moment, cant say when... For now, my family and I are dividing time between England and here. Asked about his form on the domestic circuit, he replied: Frankly, I havent done too well... Perhaps, it has something to do with a loss in confidence or... However, Ive been working hard and should soon turn the corner. During the Australian winter, of course, Andy will return to Essex. Im contracted for another two years and intend honouring commitments there, he informed, pointing out that the demands of County cricket were a challenge. Clearly, despite having quit international cricket  after a distinguished run (almost 5,000 runs in Tests and close to 7,000 in ODIs), at that  Andy continues to remain hungry. He quipped: I cannot but keep myself busy doing what I know best.  Having been impressed by the Indians Brisbane show,  Andy expects them to do well in the four-Test series.  Only, as he reminded, consistency is the need of the season.  Copyright

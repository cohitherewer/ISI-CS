		 Wednesday, January 08, 2003 				 Martinas Aussie streak snapped
																								Sydney: Nine-time Wimbledon champion Martina Navratilova lost her first doubles match in Australia in 22 years at the Sydney International on Tuesday.																								Her unbeaten streak came to an end when she and Alexandra Stevenson were beaten 6-3, 6-2 by Evie Dominikovic and Myriam Casanova. Navratilovas last doubles loss in Australia was at the 1981 Australian Open final. She won every Australian Open doubles title after that until her last appearance in 1989.																								Navratilova teamed up with Svetlana Kuznetsova to win last weeks Australian womens hardcourt title, making her the oldest player ever to win a tournament, singles or doubles, on Tour.																								Navratilova will link up again with Kuznetsova at next weeks Australian Open once she completes the 10-hour drive to Melbourne.																								She had planned to fly but said she had been forced to hit the road after airline officials told her she could not carry her new pet dog on board. (REUTERS)

 King to consult family
 King: Taking his time Sydney: Australian Cricket Academy head coach Bennett King said on Friday he would discuss with his family this weekend an offer to coach the West Indies team before making a decision. King said he was told on Monday the job was his and the media had been informed but no official appointment offer had been made and no terms and conditions agreed with him. He said on Tuesday the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) had apologised for prematurely announcing his appointment. West Indies officials on Thursday sought to clarify how they had announced their choice, saying King was informed before the media. In a statement, the WICB disputed reports that the media was informed before King received a phone call from West Indies officials. The board said that on Sunday, new West Indies chief executive Roger Brathwaite told King the board wishes to appoint him as the next West Indies coach, subject to successful completion of contractual negotiations. King said he was excited about the prospect of coaching the West Indies and looked forward to receiving a formal offer, the board said. The board held a news conference on Monday to announce Kings appointment, subject to negotiations. But that could mean little as the King family prepared to talk over the offer. King works in Adelaide with the academy but his wife and three children live in Brisbane. He is highly regarded in Australia, having guided Queensland to three consecutive Sheffield Shield titles from the 1999-2000 season after succeeding John Buchanan. King said the WICB wanted him to start in his new position in the Caribbean in the first week of July. Former Windies batsman Gus Logie is serving as interim coach for this months home series against Australia.  (AFP)  Copyright

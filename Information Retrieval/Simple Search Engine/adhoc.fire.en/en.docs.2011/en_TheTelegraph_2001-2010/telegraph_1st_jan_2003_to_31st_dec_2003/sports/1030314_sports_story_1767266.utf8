 Sledger Afridi out of tri-series
 AFRIDI: Pulled up for sledging against India Islamabad: Pakistans flamboyant batsman Shahid Afridi has been banned from playing in next months tri-nation one-day meet in Sharjah and also fined 50 per cent of his match fee on charges of sledging against Indian batsmen and an umpire during Pakistans World Cup match against India in South Africa. The punishment was handed down by the Pakistan Cricket Board on Wednesday, a media release said on Thursday. Afridi was found guilty of sledging Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sewhag and also English umpire David Shepherd during the match played in Centurion on March 1. We received an official complaint from the International Cricket Council supported with evidence. The players were told prior to their departure for South Africa that no indiscipline would be tolerated. Unfortunately, Shahid Afridi breached the players code of conduct and had to be penalised, a PCB spokesman was quoted as saying. Afridi has, however, been allowed to represent his team in the ongoing Patrons Cup one-day meet. The two-day meeting of the PCB also decided to name the team for the Sharjah tournament on March 24 after the completion of the Patrons Cup. The Sharjah tournament, to be played from April 1 to 10, will have Sri Lanka and South Africa as the two other teams. Waqar may get axe Meanwhile, Pakistan media reports said that the board may drop captain Waqar Younis and out-of-form batsman Inzamam-ul Haq for the Sharjah meet and appoint Rashid Latif as the new skipper. The board initially toyed with the idea of appointing middle order batsman Younis Khan as captain but his recent brawl with Inzamam while playing football before the crucial World Cup match against Zimbabwe came in the way, the reports said.

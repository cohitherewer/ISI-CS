																								St Johns (Antigua): West Indies need to win its opening match at the World Cup against host South Africa in order to perform well at next months tournament, the teams captain said.																								I think it is important to win our first game against South Africa, captain Carl Hooper said at the end of a two-week preparatory camp in Antigua.																								Ive got a sneaking feeling that how well we do in the first game is going to set the tone for the rest of the competition, Hooper said.																								West Indies face South Africa on Feb. 9, with matches against New Zealand, Bangladesh, Canada, Sri Lanka and Kenya to follow in their preliminary Group B. Hooper, 36, who missed the last two World Cups in 1996 and 1999 for personal reasons, said he has not set any individual goals. (PTI)

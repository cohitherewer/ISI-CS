 - NATIONAL LEAGUE - Juniors first-minute strike takes champions past Tolly  BY A STAFF REPORTER  East Bengals Cristiano Junior (left) in a tussle with Tollygunge defenders at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh Calcutta, Dec. 20: East Bengal brought home three points against Tollygunge Agragami in a National Football League match on Friday, thanks to Cristiano Juniors opening-minute goal. The final verdict, however, looked deceptive in that it would not reflect the domination of East Bengal over a team, which was undefeated in the tournament before this match. The win may be much in line with coach Subhas Bhowmicks scheme of things, planned for a marathon league, but his teams inept finishing on innumerable occasions should cause one or two furrows on his forehead as well. Bhowmick had talked about a cautious approach against Krishnendu Roys boys on the match-eve. Instead, the red-and-gold brigade started off on a boisterous note. Bhowmick fielded both Sasthi Duley and Shylo Malsawmtluanga  known for their attacking instincts in the starting line-up, though the former was operating a little deep. When Bhaichung Bhutia released a ball for Junior, it looked nothing but a laid-back move. But the Brazilian had other ideas at a time when the rival defence was still settling in their zone after the kick-off. Junior visualised the uneasiness in the Tollygunge backline and promptly unleashed a low dipping shot from about 25 yards which had no answer from goalkeeper Chinmoy Banerjee. Then in a fine attacking spell of ten minutes, East Bengal toyed with the defence on the opposite end. Alvito DCunha was the creator of all moves during that period, among which Malsawmtluangas chip was not strong enough to cross over the goalline as Chinmoy came out of his position to challenge him and Debjit Ghoshs header forced a save from Kabijit Khotel on the line. The fact that Chinmoys audacity under the Tollygunge bar was as much a joy to watch as Alvitos return to form, suggests how the NFL champions completely dominated the proceedings at Salt Lake Stadium. The likes of Bhaichung usually dont like others grabbing limelight and such occasions inspire them to rise to the billing. The East Bengal striker tried his best. But it was just a combination of his misfortune, lack of finishing and above all, a brilliant Chinmoy, that denied him a mention on the scoresheet. Bhaichung looked completely flabbergasted when Chinmoy jack-knifed his flick-on from handshaking distance on the stroke of halftime and how the goalkeeper stood in the way of his shots trajectory from another six-yard attempt after the change of sides. With Bhaichung and Co. missing one sitter after another, surviving a one-goal advantage almost through out the match also meant East Bengal rearguard was forced to live on the edges in some phases. Though Suley Musah hardly allowed Akeem Abolanle to roam around, Tollygunge attacks were mostly borne out of long-rangers. In the dying minutes, Amitabha Chandas shot from a distance missed the target by a few yards. After all, the very stadium had witnessed just the previous day how Mohammedan Sportings 1-0 cushion was ruined by two late strikes from Churchill Brothers. The way we have been missing goals is inexplicable. May be the forwards are lacking in confidence, Bhowmick said later. He also hailed Chinmoys performance saying the Tollygunge goalkeeper had denied his team at least three goals. Krishnendu, on the other hand, said conceding the first-minute goal had upset his teams rhythm. I told my boys to be careful about first quarter of the match. If we could keep East Bengal in check for that time, it might have been a different story, he felt. Teams East Bengal: Sandip Nandy; Subhas Chakraborty, Mahesh Gawli, M.

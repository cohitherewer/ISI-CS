The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sachin has a sense of occasion, says Wright
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Durban: Its no secret that coach John Wright is a Sachin Tendulkar fan and, Monday afternoon, paid him a big compliment: He has a sense of occasion. Wright made that remark while interacting with the Media at Kingsmead, during the optional workout in preparation for Wednesdays World Cup game against England. And, looking to the match, he had this to say: Its going to be tough... Obviously, the wicket here is different but, then, we trained in Durban before the tournament and that should help... Asked whether the Indians would consider a 2-2 attack  now that Ashish Nehras fitness is a worry  Wright avoided a direct answer, but stressed that omitting Anil Kumble is always a hard decision. He added: Anil doesnt like sitting in the dressing room... Even now, hes at nets. [Virender Sehwag, who hasnt been among the runs in a big way, also availed of the optional workout. It speaks highly of his attitude.] According to The Telegraphs sources, however, Ajit Agarkar should step in if Nehra isnt fit. Surprisingly, he didnt make use of the afternoon nets. Meanwhile, Yuvraj Singh (who also spoke to the Media) accepted that its been an up and-down World Cup for him and that he was hopeful things would quickly fall into place. Commenting on his four-wicket haul in Pietermaritzburg, he said: Ive always enjoyed bowling... It was no different Sunday.  Copyright

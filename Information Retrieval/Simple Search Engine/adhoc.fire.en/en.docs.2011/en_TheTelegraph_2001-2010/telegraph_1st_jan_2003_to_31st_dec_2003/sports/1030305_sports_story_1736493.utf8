The Telegraph - Calcutta
 EB eye a draw 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Though a victory was in the agenda of East Bengal when they left for Ludhiana, the red-and-gold brigade now aim to garner at least one point against JCT Wednesday. JCT is a much improved side and my team is suffering from too many niggles, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said. So I hope they get at least one point from the game. That will at least ensure that we are not under too much pressure when we go into the one-month break. Defence is the real worry for East Bengal, with two of their top men, M. Suresh and Dipak Mondal, unavailable. Also Subhashish Roy Chowdhury has an injury and I dont think he will be able to play, he opined. However, the East Bengal team has been bolstered by the return of Arun Malhotra. He joined the squad during the trip and will play Wednesdays game.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Utpal faces Ghavri wrath
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The state selectors may effect a few changes to the Bengal side when they get down to selecting the squad for the match against Hyderabad, starting December 9. A distraught coach Karsan Ghavri said at the end of days play on Tuesday that some of the players were taking their places for granted. While Devang Gandhi does not deserve to be in the team on the basis of his performance this season, Utpal Chatterjee has been a huge disappointment, Ghavri said. He, however, felt Devang will have to be persisted with as captain, since we have no other alternative. But dont be surprised if you see some shake-up in the line-up, he warned. Ghavri made it clear that it will be difficult for Subhamoy Das and Amitava Chakraborty to retain their places. CAB authorities say that since Ghavri is a part of the teams thinktank, they will obviously listen to his suggestions.  Copyright

		 Thursday, January 16, 2003 				 Incentive likely for Lanka players
																								Colombo: In a bid to recreate the 1996 glory, the Sri Lankan cricket board is contemplating doubling the match fees of its World Cup squad.																								The Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) was in talks with players to double their match fees and was also deliberating offering an additional $100,000 depending on their performance in South Africa.																								The match fees could go up from the present $700 to $1,400 if the proposal is ratified by the cricket board this week, official sources said.																								There would also be another $20,000 each if the team reaches the finals. Sri Lanka is in Group B, along with hosts South Africa, New Zealand, West Indies, Kenya and Canada and plays on February 10 against New Zealand. 																								The Lankans won in 1996 but fared miserably in the 1999 World Cup, failing to qualify for the Super Sixes. (PTI)

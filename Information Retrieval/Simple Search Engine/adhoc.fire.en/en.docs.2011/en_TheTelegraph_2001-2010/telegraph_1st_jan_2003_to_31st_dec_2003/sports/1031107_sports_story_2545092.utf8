The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Friday, November 07, 2003  Fillies may rule Day-I card 
 BY STAR RACER 				 										Calcutta: Some of the fashionably-bred fillies with classic-tag will be out to test their hooves on Friday, the seasons opening day. With the 1,000 Guineas just a fortnight away, the likes of Evangelines, Arikaras and Brighter Futures may have to come good in their respective events before vying for the November 22 line-up.				 										Evangeline, the runaway winner of the Fillies Stakes recently, may not be under much pressure to win the days main event, the Gavin Johnston Cup. It is because the Bharath Singh-trainee had trounced Brighter Future in that race. However, the lalter, a Daniel David -ward, had served notice of her improvement while going down to Arikara because of weight disadvantage. Equally improved is Arikara who is heading for a hattrick of wins.				 										Selections and card				 										1.

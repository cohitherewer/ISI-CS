 Sehwag hits a quick 30
London: Virender Sehwag hit 30 off 21 balls to help Leicestershire to 72 for one at close on the opening day of their four-day County championship tie against Warwickshire at Grace Road last evening. Warwickshire scored 253 in their first innings. Sehwag played some cracking shots, hit six boundaries but it was cut short by a quick delivery from Melvyn Betts which skidded through to shatter his stumps. Yuvraj Singh continued with his lean patch, contributing only six in Yorkshires 314 for seven against Derbyshire on the opening day of their Division II tie.  (PTI)  Copyright

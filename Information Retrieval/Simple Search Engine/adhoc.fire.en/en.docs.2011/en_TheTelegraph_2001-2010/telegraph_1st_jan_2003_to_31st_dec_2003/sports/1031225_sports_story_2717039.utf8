 Indian veterans clinch series
Agra: India defeated Pakistan by seven wickets in the third and final one-dayer to clinch the Goodwill Veterans series 2-1 on Wednesday. Rajesh Chauhans five-wicket haul helped India reduce the visitors to 171, which they overhauled comfortably. Poor weather conditions reduced the match to a 35-over affair. Put into bat, Pakistan were all out for 171 in 33.2 overs, Sadiq Mohammad (34), Aamir Malik (30) and Manzoor Ilahi (23) being the chief contributors. Medium-pacer Vivek Razdan chipped in with two wickets. India were given a flying start by Surinder Khanna (44) and Maninder Singh (81), who put on 135 for the opening stand. Maninders 81 came off 102 balls and included three sixes before he was retired hurt. Atul Wassan remained unbeaten on 23.  (PTI)  Copyright

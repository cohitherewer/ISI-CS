 Ralf lands in hospital after test crash
 Ralf Schumacher is okay but needs more checks Monza: Formula One world title contender Ralf Schumacher was taken to hospital on Tuesday after crashing his Williams heavily in testing at Monza. Hes okay but has been taken to hospital for further checks, said a team spokeswoman. Hes walking and the engineers are saying he is okay and everything. Ralf, whose car had caught fire in the Monza pit lane in the morning, went off the track at the Lesmo corner about two minutes before the close of the session. Witnesses said his car was badly damaged. The Autosport website reported that his older brother Michael, the five-time world champion who was also testing at Monza for Ferrari, was with him. Ralf is fourth with three races to go, 14 points behind leader Michael. Williams lead Ferrari in the constructors championship by eight points. Earlier, marshals hurried to extinguish flames after an apparent oil leak flared up when the German came in after his first few laps. It was nothing major, it looked worse than it was, said the spokeswoman. All the Formula One teams are testing at Monza, the venue for next weeks Italian Grand Prix. Ferrari, portrayed as a team in crisis by the Italian media after Schumacher was lapped and finished eighth in the last Hungarian Grand Prix, are throwing everything at the tests to regain the title initiative.

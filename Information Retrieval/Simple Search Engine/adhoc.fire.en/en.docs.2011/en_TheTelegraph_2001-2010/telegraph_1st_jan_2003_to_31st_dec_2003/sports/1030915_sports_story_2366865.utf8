The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak look to wrap ODI series
Lahore: Pakistan with a fit-again pacer Mohammed Sami will set out to sweep a one-day series against a hapless Bangladesh side in the third one-day International on Monday. Pakistan beat the tourists by 137 runs in the first match in Multan and by 74 runs in the second in Faisalabad last week to go 2-0 up in the five-match series. Samis return in the 15-man squad strengthens our attack and we will definitely go for a 3-0 lead in the series, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said. The 22-year old Sami missed Pakistans 3-0 Test win preceding the one-day series due to ankle injury and may get a tune-up before a tougher home series against South Africa starting later this month. We are aiming to be more and more consistent and if you attain consistency you can beat any opponent, said Inzamam, who replaced Rashid Latif as skipper. Latif was handed a ban of five one-day matches after he claimed an unfair catch in the third and final Test against Bangladesh in Multan last week. Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore stressed improvement in his team to ensure victory. The improvement in overall performance of the team is victory for me and I am achieving that, said Whatmore. Bangladesh have lost 39 of their 41 limited over Internationals with two rained-off matches since upsetting Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup, held in England. The two remaining matches will be played in Rawalpindi on September 18 and Karachi on September 21.  (AFP)  Copyright

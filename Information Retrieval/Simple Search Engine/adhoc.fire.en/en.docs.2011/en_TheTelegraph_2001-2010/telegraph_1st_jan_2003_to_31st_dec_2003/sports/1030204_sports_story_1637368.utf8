 HAL beat Indian Bank 
 Bangalore: Ending a miserable run, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited scored a 1-0 victory over Chennais Indian Bank, thanks to a superb goal by their Nigerian import Kenneth Onu, in the OIL PSU National League here on Monday. Onu headed home dramatically off an excellent pass from Dayananda in the 37th minute to leave the Indian Bank goalkeeper Sebastian Netto stranded. Otherwise, Netto did a fine job under the bar, effecting a few good saves. With this win, the Bangalore-based HAL have secured seven points from 11 encounters. Indian Bank, who had begun their NFL campaign in style after being promoted from the second division before losing steam, could not get their act together and failed to put up a cohesive show. The bankers remain on 11 points from an equal number of outings. Earlier in the first half, Netto collected powerful shots from Jagdish Kumar and Rajendra Prasad neatly while Dayandanda messed up a good chance and his effort was off target by a whisker.

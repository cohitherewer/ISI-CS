The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United increase Ronaldinho offer
Paris: Manchester United have increased their offer for Paris St Germains Brazilian World Cup-winning midfielder Ronaldinho to 30 million euros ($33.47 million), PSG sources were quoted as saying on Wednesday. Manchester are now very near PSG expectations, at least 30 million euros before any profit-sharing scheme, PSG sources said in sports daily LEquipe. They came with good arguments, practically what we were expecting from them. LEquipe also reported that Barcelona have made a similar bid for the Brazilian World Cup winner. Barcelonas offer is now in the range of 30 million euros and doesnt include any more players like French defender Philippe Christanval and Argentine playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme, the paper said. United manager Alex Ferguson said on Tuesday that the English champions were close to completing a deal with PSG. Ronaldinhos agent and brother Roberto Assis told Reuters on Tuesday he hoped an agreement would be reached this week. We are very optimistic... things are moving quickly. I dont think Ronnie will sign anything this week because he has a lot of things to do in Brazil but he is happy and so am I. The 23-year-old Ronaldinho, who has stated that he wants to leave PSG, failed to join the Paris clubs pre-season training camp and has remained in Brazil. PSG have said his contract has been suspended to punish him for his absence.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

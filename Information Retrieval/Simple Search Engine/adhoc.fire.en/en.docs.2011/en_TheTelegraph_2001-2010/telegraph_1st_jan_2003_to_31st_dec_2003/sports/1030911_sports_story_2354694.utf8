 Lessons for Pillay amp; Co. 
 Serve amp; Volley / Naresh Kumar Dhanraj Pillay should'nt  have argued with the umpire in the Dutch game Becalmed in the doldrums for decades,  Indian sport has at long last dipped an oar in the stagnant  waters of our sporting world. Outstanding performances at  Asian and international levels in a number of disciplines  have filled sporting hearts with joy and brought a ray of  hope into our lives.  The media, starved of Indian heroes,  lapped up the success stories. The exposure provided a wake-up  call to the government and stimulated potential sponsors  in a surging economy. The normally tardy-gaited government  jumped on the bandwagon and announced substantial financial  rewards with promises to fund further training, in one case  for an unbelievable Rs 1 crore.  The Prime Minister has now promised  income tax relief for all donations to sport! Happily, at  last, things are beginning to move. The most significant  impact of the good performance by our sportspersons is that  it has changed the perception of sport at the political  and administrative level. The enormous gap between the pittance  that government budgets provide for sport and the actual  requirement to produce world-class performers has become  apparent and is reflected somewhat in the financial rewards  doled out. What our sportspersons have achieved on shoestring  budgets can be termed as miraculous. They deserve the highest  praise. We had high expectations from  our hockey team. Its loss in the Champions Trophy was heartbreaking.  The team seemed to be full of new-found resolve, but at  the end was reduced to tears. Whatever reasons the experts  may give, two things in my estimation were vital factors  which affected its performance.  One was the blunder of captain  Dhanraj Pillay in contesting, with other senior players,  the controversial goal the Dutch scored to level the score  at 3-3 in the dying minutes of the match. Umpires do not  change such decisions. The prolonged protest resulted  in Pillay being sent off, leaving a disheartened team unable  to adjust to the fact that victory had been snatched from  their grasp. Before they could recover and regroup, the  Dutch, who were on a high after the miraculous turnaround  from 0-3, quickly slammed the winning goal in the last minute  for a 4-3 victory.  Instead of getting them to rally  and gear up for one last comeback attempt, Pillay had unwittingly  destroyed the morale of the team. Such things happen in  sport, especially when you are under great pressure to measure  up to the media hype before the tournament. I hope we will  learn from this.  I am still upbeat about our hockey  team. Jugraj (Singh), who will surely recover fully, (Baljit  Singh) Saini and Gagan Ajit (Singh), with a further raised  level of strength and physical fitness, can upstage the  Europeans with their skill. Jugrajs accident is a tragic  blow to Indian hockey. A short corner conversion specialist  was badly needed in our team. His absence will leave a vacuum  which will be difficult to fill. One prays he will recover  soon. Even in his twilight years, it  is a joy to watch Pillay make one of his swashbuckling runs  weaving his way through the opposition. He is undoubtedly  one of our all-time greats. Indian hockey has a good future  provided we persevere with our efforts. The second reason for the failure  in Champions Trophy was possibly the training camp in the  searing Lucknow heat just before the tournament. Some players  complained that it sapped their energy. The concept of improving  physical fitness of players in a brief camp is a myth.  To attain a level of physical  fitness enjoyed by top European teams it would take 2-3  years of properly programmed physical training along with  proper diet control. If you spend more energy in training  than you can put back overnight, then you start to lose  condition. This could well have happened as players tend  to go flat out for getting selected. I remember in 1962, India were  playing against Mexico in Chennai in the inter-zone finals  of the Davis Cup. The association, in good faith, engaged  an Australian coach  Stan Edwards  to sharpen up and train  the team. Australian regimes of training  and ours are poles apart. On the first day, Edwards took  the team to the beach and made the players run on the sand  while he cruised alongside driving an old Fiat with a cigarette  dangling from his lips. Ramanathan Krishnan took one look  and firmly said he was going home.  Jaidip (Mukerjea), Premjit (Lal)  and Akhtar (Ali), who were contenders for the second singles  spot, were furious but did not wish to displease the coach  as it might affect their chances of selection. So they ran  every morning on the sand. Eventually, Jaidip was selected,  but his calf muscles felt like lead and he lost a match  he may well have won. Top-class foreign coaches and  physical trainers are a must for Indian sport, but they  have to learn to handle Indian sportspersons who normally  do not have the brawn and muscle of their European counterparts,  and rely more on skill and guile. Leander (Paes) illness was most  disturbing. The whole nation breathed a sigh of relief when  he came out of the shadow of the Big C. With two mixed doubles  victories partnering Martina Navratilova in his pocket,  Leander was poised at the net to collect yet another Grand  Slam title. But, who can anticipate or intercept the passing  shots of the Lord that sent him from the tennis court to  the hospital? Even without the threat of the  Big C, this is a major blow for Leander. At a time when  he was on a roll and in peak form, he may be out of the  game for two-three months, which will mean heavy financial  loss.  He has to get back that look in  his eye, pump his fists and come out of his corner at his  fighting best. Good luck to him. Copyright

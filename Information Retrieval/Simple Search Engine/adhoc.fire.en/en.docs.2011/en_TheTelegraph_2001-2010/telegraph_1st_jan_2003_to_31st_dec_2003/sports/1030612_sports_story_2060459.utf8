The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ray in place of Banerjee
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Justice Umesh Banerjee (retired) is no more part of the three-member committee that was appointed by the Calcutta High Court to oversee administration of Mohun Bagan Club. His letter, seeking release from such duties was accepted by the court on Wednesday. The court has now appointed retired judge G. N. Ray in his place. A division bench, comprising Justice M. H. S. Ansari and Justice Arun Mitra, in an order, appointed Justice Ray. In his letter seeking release, Justice Banerjee had cited other pre-occupations for his not being able to continue. The other two members of the committee are retired Justice Shyamal Sen and senior advocate Indrajit Sen. The court had made the initial appointments of the three special officers on May 23 and had ordered the existing executive committee to work under instructions from them. Later, secretary Anjan Mitra and the rest had contested that it was not possible to work the football affairs of the club in this set-up. With the league advancing, the need for order was urgent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real lose advantage
 Raul equalised when he met Michel Salgados curling cross with a glancing header, but that only fetched Real Madrid a draw versus Celta Vigo at the Bernabeu Saturday Madrid: Real Madrid handed the advantage to Real Sociedad in the race for the title when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Celta Vigo at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. The result means that with just two games left, Real are level on points with Sociedad but the Basque side stay atop with a better head-to-head record. We dominated throughout the game, said Real coach Vicente del Bosque. And a point seems very little reward for all our efforts. Deportivo La Coruna, who still have a slim chance of taking the title, are six points adrift in third place. Celta, meanwhile, trail their Galician neighbours by a further eight points. Real dominated for long periods at the Bernabeu but could not take advantage against a tactically astute Celta who packed their midfield to restrict the home sides attacking options. Raul did get the ball into the net on six minutes after Zinedine Zidane had teased open the Celta defence, but the goal was ruled out for off-side. Celta were pinned back in their own area for long periods and keeper Pablo Cavallero had to stop Luis Figo giving Real the lead with a rasping drive on the 20-minute mark. It was Celta who cashed in on one of their few attacking opportunities, however, when Russian midfielder Alexander Mostovoi got ahead of the Real defence to power a header inside the near post 10 minutes before halftime. Real stepped up a gear after the break and drew level when Raul netted when he met Michel Salgados curling cross with an expert glancing header on 68 minutes.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

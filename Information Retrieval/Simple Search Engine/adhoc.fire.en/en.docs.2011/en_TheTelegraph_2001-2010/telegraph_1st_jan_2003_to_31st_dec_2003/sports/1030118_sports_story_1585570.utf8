The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, January 18, 2003 				 Md. Sp. pay for misses 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Mohammedan Sportings Dipendu Biswas (left) and Abdulateef Seriki being escorted out of the ground 																								Calcutta: Trouble scarred Mohammedan Sportings encounter versus Calcutta Port Trust at the formers ground Friday. The match ended goalless, but not before Mohammedan sporting had thrown away endless chances to win and go through to the semi-finals of the IFA Shield. This draw pushes Mohammedan Sporting out of the fray.																								Trouble started a little over three minutes into injury time when a Syed Rahim Nabi effort at the goalmouth, off a loose pass from Abdulateef Seriki, was dislodged. Goalkeeper Sandeep Guha jumped to it, so did a couple of defenders. Seriki and Nabi challenged referee Sarat Chandra Singh of Manipur and demanded a penalty. However, the referee felt it wasnt a foul charge, either by the goalkeeper or by any of the defenders.																								That started the trouble, and spectators broke through the fencing of the south-west stands and chased the officials and Port players. 																								The match itself was totally dominated by Mohammedan Sporting. Seriki was the main culprit, with a huge number of misses. Except for a couple of occasions, Port were intent on only keeping the home team at bay, throwing everything they had in defence. Even if they did break through the defensive cordon several times, the Mohammedan Sporting attackers and medios failed to coalesce at the golamouth and the final punch never came.																								In the 26th minute Bejoy Pal of Port made a great goalline save off a Dipendu Biswas-Seriki attempt, after a Srimanta Dutta save as Nabi hesitated in the 17th minute. Seriki shot into the goalkeeper in the 24th minute and seven minutes later Seriki again rose late to head and allowed goalkeeper Sandeep Guha to clear. Sandeep had a good match under the bar.

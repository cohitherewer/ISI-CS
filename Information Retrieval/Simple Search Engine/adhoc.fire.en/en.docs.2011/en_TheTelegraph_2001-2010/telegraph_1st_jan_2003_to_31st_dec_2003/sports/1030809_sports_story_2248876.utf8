 McEnroe mulls move to politics
Lisbon: Three-time mens Wimbledon champion John McEnroe, famed for his temper tantrums and rows with umpires, said he is considering becoming a politician in an interview published on Friday. I may decide to dedicate myself to politics, to get involved in the real problems people face, he told Portuguese newspaper Publico. But I would need some five years to study the issues, it would be like returning to school, he added. The American great, nicknamed Superbrat for his regular run-ins with authority, currently works as a respected TV analyst. McEnroe, who also runs an art gallery and has presented a television show and worked as a tennis coach, admitted that the life of a politician would be difficult. It is frustrating because you get the sense that people do not have a lot of trust in politicians, which goes against what I believe, but is the result of the way they behave, he added. McEnroe, 44, is in Portugal to take part in the Vale do Lobo Grand Champions tennis tournament in the southern Algarve resort province.  (AFP)  Copyright

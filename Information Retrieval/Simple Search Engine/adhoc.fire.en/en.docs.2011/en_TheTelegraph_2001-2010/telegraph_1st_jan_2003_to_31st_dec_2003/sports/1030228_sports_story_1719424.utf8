The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Newcastle soar on Shearer hattrick
 Alan Shearer dives to head in Newcastles first goal against Leverkusen during their Champions League match Thursday. (AFP) Paris: Alan Shearers first hattrick for Newcastle United in over three years fired them to a 3-1 win over last seasons Champions League finalists Bayer Leverkusen and gave the Magpies a real chance of making the last eight. One of Newcastle manager Bobby Robsons former clubs, Barcelona, are virtually assured of a place in the last eight after a 0-0 draw away at Inter Milan Wednesday that left them needing just one point from their last two matches. The draw meant Barca failed to break Ajaxs all-time winning streak in European competition of 11 set in the Cup Winners Cup campaigns of 1986-87 and 87-88. In what could turn out to be a delicious twist, Barcelonas match in Newcastle could decide whether it is the English side or Inter who progress with them from group A. Group B is a far tighter affair after as Roma roused themselves from their slumber and stunned Valencia 3-0 in Spain  captain Francesco Totti getting two  to hand the hosts their first-ever Champions League home defeat. Ajaxs 0-0 draw at home to Arsenal meant both of them moved up to six points with two matches to play while Valencia  finalists in two of the last three seasons  have five and Roma three. It was Shearers night though as he struck three times in the opening 36 minutes at St James Park, two of them headers thanks largely to the terrible defending of Brazilian Cris, who looks a long shot to add to his 11 caps for his country given his last two performances for Leverkusen. Shearers third came from the penalty spot. Despite his 15th career hattrick, Shearer said he was delighted to have at last scored a Champions League goal from open play. (AFP)  Copyright

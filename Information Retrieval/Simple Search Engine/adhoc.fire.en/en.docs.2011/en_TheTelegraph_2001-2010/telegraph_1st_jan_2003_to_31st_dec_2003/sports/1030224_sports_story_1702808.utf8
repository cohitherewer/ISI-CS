The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vaughan uncertain versus India
Durban: Englands leading batsman Michael Vaughan is struggling to be fit for Wednesdays World Cup Group A match against India because of a right calf strain. England and Wales Cricket Board spokesman Andrew Walpole said: He is a concern. He will be continuing to have treatment and will be assessed in 24 hours. Vaughan played a big role in Saturdays win over Pakistan with a half-century but did not field. He later underwent a scan. England must beat either India or Australia to keep their hopes alive of reaching the second stage of the tournament. Vaughan had been in good nick in the World Cup, with two half-centuries against Namibia and Pakistan in three outings. Vaughan missed a Test series in Pakistan at the end of 2000 with a torn right calf muscle. The right-handers career has been blighted by a string of injuries. (Agencies)  Copyright

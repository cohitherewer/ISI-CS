The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, September 03, 2003  Chouhan spoils Yadavs party 
 BY STAR RACER		 R.Yadav					Calcutta: What would have been jockey R. Yadavs first ever treble was foiled by visiting rider P. Chouhan on Tuesday. Riding a forceful race on a rank outsider, Regal Rocket, Chouhan pipped Yadavs favourite Anokato at the post in the Predator Cup. Earlier, Yadav had guided trainer Errol Bhungards Brave Venture and Moon Quest to victory in their respective events.				 										Regal Rocket, an eight-year-old from trainer T. N. Jaiswals yard, paid back his schooler for keeping an aged horse in such a fine condition and form. It was Regal Rockets third win in four starts this season.				 										Sharing honours with Yadav and Errol on the day was trainer Bharath Singh whose Argento and Frontier Flame had won untroubled.				 										Meanwhile, stewards handed a two day suspension to jockey Surjeet Singh for excessive use of the whip on Sugar Daddy. It was his third offence and thus the penalty. Yadav, too, was booked for the second time on the day.				 										RESULTS				 										1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Becker once more in dock
Munich, June 14 (AP): Eight months after getting a two-year probation on tax evasion charges, three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker is headed back to court. The retired tennis star faces charges that he failed to provide 1.5 million euros ($1.78 million) to pay off the debts of bankrupt Internet site Sportsgate as agreed upon in a July 2000 contract. The court has scheduled the proceedings for September 18, Munich County Court spokesman Christian Ottmann told the weekly magazine Focus in its latest issue. Sportgates bankruptcy lawyer, Hartwig Albers, filed the charges, saying Becker received 60 per cent of the company when he signed the contract. The Internet sports provider is one of several failed businesses for Becker in a rocky retirement from tennis in 1999. He has also undergone a messy public divorce from his wife Barbara, as well as fathered an out-of-wedlock child with a Russian model. Becker, still one of Germanys biggest sports heroes, barely avoided jail time in October when he was convicted of evading 1.7 million euros ($2.02 million) in taxes. The court ruled he claimed to live in tax haven Monte Carlo, while actually residing in Munich.  Copyright

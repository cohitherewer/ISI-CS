 Youhana, Younis star in Pakistan victory
 - sharjah cup l Sangakkara (100 n.o.) heroics in vain  Kumar Sangakkara, who remained not out on 100 against Pakistan, in Sharjah Friday. (AFP) Sharjah: Yousuf Youhana and Younis Khan overcame a stubborn Sri Lankan resistance to guide Pakistan to a seven-wicket victory Friday, their second successive win in the four-nation tournament. Youhana and Younis rode their luck to hit unbeaten half-centuries and take Pakistan past Sri Lankas 223 for six which was built around a maiden unbeaten century by Kumar Sangakkara. Pakistan, who had beaten Zimbabwe in the inaugural match Thursday, finished with 225 for three with 16 balls to spare. Yousuf and Younis came together at the score of 101 in the 29th over in which Pakistan saw two of its set batsmen getting run out. Youhana (64 n.o.), who was dropped by Jehan Mubarak in the 31st over, made the Sri Lankans pay dearly for their mistake. Younis (57 n.o.) too survived a few close calls before settling down to play a fine knock. Earlier, Sangakkara hit 100 not out to ensure a respectable score for the Lankans after skipper Sanath Jayasuriya won the toss and elected to bat. Sangakkara kept them going despite the regular loss of wickets at the other end. For Pakistan, rookie opener Mohammed Hafeez chipped in with an important 50 while Faisal Iqbal contributed of 32. Taufeeq Umar was the only Pakistani batsman to miss out on a decent score, being bowled by Dilhara Fernando for six in the eighth over. Hafeez and Iqbal then put on 76 runs for the second wicket to set up the chase. Earlier, Sangakkara held the Sri Lankan innings together after big gins Jayasuriya (27) and Maravan Atapattu (13) left early. The left-hander put up significant partnerships with the lower middle order batsmen to ensure a decent score.  (PTI)  Copyright

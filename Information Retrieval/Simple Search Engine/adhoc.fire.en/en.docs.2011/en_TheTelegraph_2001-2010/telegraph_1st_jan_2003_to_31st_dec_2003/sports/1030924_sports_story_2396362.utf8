 Ross warning for India
 NZ coach Ross feels his team could make history in India Visakhapatnam: New Zealands coach Ashley Ross Tuesday sounded a warning to the Indians, saying his team had been pulling off historic wins of late and was capable of doing it on Indian soil too. We did well in England and the West Indies. The Sri Lanka tour earlier this year shows that we are performing better in Asia. This team has been making history. Though we have never won in India, my boys may make history once again, Ross told newspersons here. Exuding confidence of his team performing well in India, Ross said the Black Caps had prepared well ahead of their tour, and the players were fit and raring to go. Back in New Zealand, cricket is the second most popular game after rugby. But here in India, it is the most popular sport, naturally, we are very excited, the coach said. We prepared very well keeping in mind the Indian conditions and its celebrated spin attack. I am very satisfied with the tune-up, and that makes me hopeful, he said after the tourists first net session in India this afternoon. Asked how the tourists were acclimatising to the Indian conditions, Ross said, this is cricket. We have to feel at home under every condition. However, he expressed happiness with the weather as also the arrangements here. The weather is beautiful. My boys are all enjoying themselves. I also have no case for complaint about the arrangements. The hospitality extended to us is wonderful, he said. Ross also praised the wicket at the newly built APCA-VDCA Stadium, the venue of his teams tour lung-opener against the Board Presidents XI from Friday. Im very impressed with the wicket. It looks terrific. I think it will have bounce. It will assist pacers and take a little bit of spin too, he said. On the Virender Sehwag led Board Presidents XI, which has players of the calibre of V V S Laxman and Yuvraj Singh, Ross said yes, it looks a very strong team.  (PTI)  Copyright

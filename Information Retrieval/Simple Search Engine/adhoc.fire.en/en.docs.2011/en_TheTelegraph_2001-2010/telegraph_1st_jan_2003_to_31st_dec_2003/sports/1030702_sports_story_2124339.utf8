The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Contracts issue to dominate
New Delhi: The contracts issue is all set to dominate the agenda at the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias highly-awaited working committee meeting beginning Wednesday. The two-day meeting has a slew of issues before it, including the approval of the itinerary for the home series against New Zealand later this year and the extensions to coach John Wright and physiotherapist Andrew Leipus. But Indias share of the World Cup revenues withheld by the ICC will certainly be the prime concern. That would be the biggest issue before us. The meeting will try to find a way to recover our money, a top Board official said. The issues emerging out of the spinners conclave in Calcutta last month would also be discussed and taken forward.

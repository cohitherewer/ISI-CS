The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dutta is new IFA secy
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Dutta, a unanimous choice Calcutta: Subrata Dutta was unanimously selected as the new Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Sunday, abolishing eight years of joint-secretary rule in the games state governing body. There was promise as much as pressure of a new beginning, admitted Dutta, soon after occupying the chair. Its a tough job ahead. But I promise to give it my best, he said, adding that corporatisation of the IFA will be one of his top priorities. One of his key assignments will also hover over selling new television rights after IFAs deal with ESPN gets over. As expected, there was no election as former outgoing joint secretaries Ranjit Gupta and Kesto Pal declined to join in the fight. Debu Mukherjee of Taltala Dipti Sangha proposed Duttas name in the IFA governing body meeting and no member opposed it. In fact, before his appointment, all 47 Governing Body members, including East Bengal and Mohun Bagan, wrote to him stating their stand in favour of a one-secretary scene in the association. Dutta, who was the treasurer in the outgoing regime, and nephew of former secretary Prodyut Dutta, later said the two-secretary scene in the office was required to be dispensed with because of growing discontent between the two officials over a number of issues of late. He also allayed doubts over a monolithic administrator against a fast expanding world of football in the country. Everything depends on how fast and efficiently one deals with the situations. Im confident to run the administration both nationally and locally, Dutta maintained. Dutta further revealed that setting up information development cell as well as media and public relation cell would be his other two priorities. Both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan secretaries, Kalyan Majumdar and Anjan Mitra, were present at the meeting and later congratulated Dutta.  Copyright

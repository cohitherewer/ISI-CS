				 	 Gillespie: World Cup performance wont be affected																								Adelaide: Australian fast bowler Jason Gillespie blamed Sydney Cricket Ground staff on Monday for an injury that will sideline him for three weeks.																								Gillespie, 27, tore ligaments in his left elbow when he slipped after the delivery stride on Sunday in the fifth Ashes Test. 																								The injury will keep him out of crucial games against England and Sri Lanka in the tri-nations limited overs series.																								The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) released a statement on Tuesday to say Gillespie, who landed awkwardly on his left elbow while bowling had visited a specialist in Melbourne.																								The assessment revealed capsule damage to the elbow joint and the fast bowler has been instructed to rest for two to three weeks, the ACB statement said.																								Gillespie would be reassessed on January 19 by the team physiotherapist Errol Alcott, the ACB added.																								Groundsmen had reinforced crumbling areas of the pitch during Australias heavy defeat. Gillespie said he was told by a specialist he would miss up to three weeks because of the latest problem in an injury-cursed career.																								It gets frustrating, Gillespie said on returning to his home city Tuesday. Especially for something to happen like that which really shouldnt have happened. 																								The footmarks were quite deep. The groundsmen repaired them but I dont think they repaired them properly and it was very slippery out there.																								Gillespies injury followed Shane Warnes shoulder dislocation and Glenn McGraths side strain, heightening fears for the health of Australias best bowlers leading into next months World Cup.																								But Gillespie said the trio would be at their peak of their powers for the Cup. 																								You dont lose your skills overnight so they (Warne and McGrath) will pick it up pretty well and Im only a couple of weeks or so away, so I dont think there are any problems there, Gillespie said. There is plenty of time to prepare for the World Cup. (PTI)

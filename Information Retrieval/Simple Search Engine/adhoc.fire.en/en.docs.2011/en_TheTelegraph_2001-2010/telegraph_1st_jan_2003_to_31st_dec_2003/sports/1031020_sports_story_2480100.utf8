The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Monday, October 20, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Perth: Former Zimbabwe star Andy Flower made an inglorious start to his Australian career here Sunday when he was ousted for a duck in his first Sheffield Shield innings. 				 																																	Shaping up for South Australia at the WACA Ground, the 35-year-old veteran lasted only two minutes before being trapped by little known Western Australian medium-pacer Peter Worthington. Flower, who has a Test average of more than 50, is contracted to South Australia after quitting international cricket after his much publicised protest against Zimbabwes human rights record during the World Cup earlier this year. South Australia, however, finished on a competitive 316 for nine wickets by stumps. 				 																																	Belgaum: The Indian pair of Vishal Uppal and Mustafa Ghouse lost in the final of the ATP Challenger on Sunday. The Indians lost 6-7 (3-7), 6-7 (2-7) to the Slovakian duo of Branislav Sekac and Michal Mertinak. Russias Yuri Schukin won the mens singles title with a 6-3, 6-2 win over Germanys Dieter Kindlmann. He took home $ 3,600. Leander Paes gave away the prizes.				 																																	Phillip Island: Italys MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi overcame a 10-second penalty to win his third successive Australian Grand Prix in brilliant style on Sunday.				 																																	Pole sitter Rossi took the lead in the fifth lap of the 27-lap race and soon established a three-second lead but was handed a 10-second penalty for overtaking under a yellow flag. Stung by the penalty, the impish Rossi blitzed around the track and with four laps remaining, he was 10.392 seconds ahead, not including his penalty.				 																																	Beijing: Chinas up and coming womens long distance runner Sun Yingjie on Sunday broke the Asian marathon mark by winning the Beijing Marathon in a time of 2:19.39, leading a Chinese sweep in the event. Sun ran unchallenged throughout the race, finished ahead of teammate Zhou Chunxiu, who clocked 2:23.41 to finish second and Zhang Shujing who came in third with a time of 2:27.57. Among men, South Africas Ian Syster clocked 2:07.49 to win the gold medal.				 																																	Bangalore: Around 120 golfers from India, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Australia, the UK, Malaysia, Pakistan and Singapore are expected to take part in the 13th edition of the Asia Pacific senior amateur golf championship starting here on Wednesday. The three-day, 54 hole competition, to be hosted by the Bangalore Golf Club, is coming to India for the first time, the secretary-general of the Asia Pacific Golf Confederation, Dilip Thomas said. 				 																																	Doha: An extraordinary Fifa Congress gave unanimous approval on Sunday to a statute that will allow young players with dual nationality to switch countries. It also extended Fifa president Sepp Blatters  term in office by another year to 2007. During a brisk first  two hours of business, the meeting, attended by all 204  member associations of Fifa for the first time, approved  a new constitution. This is wonderful, said Blatter.

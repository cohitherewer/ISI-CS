The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan coach blames keeper now
  BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Subrata Bhattacharya was a dejected man following his teams 0-2 loss to Salgaocar in their National League match on Monday. And as has happened many times this season, he didnt hesitate for a moment before putting the blame squarely on the shoulders of his players. This time it was the turn of keeper Bivash Ghosh. The coach lashed out at his goalie, saying he had cheated the club. Bivash is now telling me that he had an injury. He didnt divulge that earlier and let in such a bad goal. It is hard to understand how a coach cannot have any idea about the physical condition of his wards prior to a match. The Bagan coach also acknowledged that his team does not really have the ability to come back after being down. Not a fitting remark from the coach of the defending National League champions. If Bivash hadnt let that in, we could have at least stayed in the fight, Bhattacharya lamented. On the other hand, after their comeback win against Dempo, East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick said he feared complacency is creeping into his boys. Yes, its a good lead, and complacency can come in. Even I am also a little complacent, Bhowmick said. He made it clear that they would have to come out of this mental frame to clinch the title. There are a number of good teams and anyone can go past us in the next phase, a cautious Bhowmick added. Talking of the win, he said: Its one of our best performances this season. The boys really came back well after being down. Bhowmick also had a word or praise for the Dempo side. I had said yesterday that they are a good team. The five-goal drubbing (against Bagan) was an accident and they proved it today, Bhowmick added.  Copyright

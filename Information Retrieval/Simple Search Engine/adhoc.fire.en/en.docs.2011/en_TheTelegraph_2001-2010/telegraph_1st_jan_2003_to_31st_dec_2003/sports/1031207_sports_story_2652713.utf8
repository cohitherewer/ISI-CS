The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Different team theme for each Test
 - Gordon authors the first: Never Have a Backward Step  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Focus-encouraging themes can make a difference, feels Sandy Gordon Jaipur, Dec. 6: Unlike this years World Cup, where Team India had one theme (Now or Never) for the tournament, the current tour of Australia will see as many as five. According to The Telegraphs sources, Sourav Ganguly and Co. have accepted hot shot sport psychologist Sandy Gordons suggestion of a separate theme for each of the four Tests and one for the January 9-February 10 tri-series. Zimbabwe, by the way, is the third team in that competition. Gordon, one understands, has set the ball rolling by picking the theme for the on-going first Test at the Gabba: Never Have a Backward Step. Actually, thus far, the Indians havent taken one. The next four themes will, of course, be chosen by us  on the eve of the three remaining Tests and the tri-series, informed a senior member of the touring party, when contacted in Brisbane this afternoon. He added: The idea, basically, is to keep setting goals... Fresh targets... After all, its such a long tour... Indeed, everyone feels this is more challenging and the concept, then, has been very well received... Gordon, who has already had a session with Team India, will (as of now) again meet the boys before the third Test (Melbourne, December 26-30) and in the lead-up to the tri-series. Among other things, he believes focus-encouraging themes make a big difference. Incidentally, the World Cup theme was decided upon after Gordons interaction with the Indians in Paarl, on the eve of their campaign-launch. As it turned out, Team India made the final.  Copyright

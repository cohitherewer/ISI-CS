The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Security not bothering BCCI
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Thursdays pitch-damaging incident by Shiv Sena activists to foil an India-Pakistan tie among the veteran cricketers in Agra will have no impact on the Asian A team championship, starting here from Monday, said the BCCI. The Agra incident will have no bearing on this tournament. We are not at all worried about that event, but we are cautious, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said on Friday. He, however, added that round-the-clock police security will be provided to the players of the three teams  Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India. Security will be tightened for the players from the moment they arrive in the city, he said. All teams will land in the city on Saturday. The tri-nation meet will open with the clash between India and Sri Lanka A teams on Monday. All matches (seven in total) will be held at Eden Gardens. Former Indian pace spearhead Jawagal Srinath, who recently retired from international cricket, will return to action in a new attire during the tournament. He will join Gundappa Viswanath as Match Referee for the meet. Jasbir Singh and K. Hariharan are the two umpires from the host nation. Meanwhile, season tickets priced Rs 100 and Rs 50, will be sold from the Eden gate No. 4 from Saturday while daily tickets in the price range of Rs 20 and 10 will be available from Mohammedan Sporting club tent on match days.

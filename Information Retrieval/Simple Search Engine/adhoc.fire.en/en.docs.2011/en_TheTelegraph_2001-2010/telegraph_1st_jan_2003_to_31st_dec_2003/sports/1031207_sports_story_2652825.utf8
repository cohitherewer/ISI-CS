		 Sunday, December 07, 2003  BRIEFS
				 																																	Barcelona:Real Madrid players had eggs and tomatoes thrown at them as they arrived at their hotel in Barcelona on Friday.				 																																	Real, who take on arch-rivals Barcelona in the Primera Liga on Saturday, received cheers from several hundred fans when they arrived at El Prat airport on the eve of the match.				 																																	The reaction was more hostile as they got off the team bus to check into their hotel, but there were no serious incidents of violence. The last time the two sides met at the Nou Camp, the referee had to lead the players from the field as the crowd rained down missiles on former Barcelona player Luis Figo as he took the corners, with even a stuffed pigs head making it on to the field .				 																																	Ljubljana: Slovenia playmaker Zlatko Zahovic has retired from international football, he has told Slovenian newspaper Delo.				 																																	Zahovic won a record 77 caps for his country. My decision to stop playing for the national team is final, he was quoted as saying on Saturday. Theres just a conversation with the coach still to be done, but there are no more doubts.				 																																	The 32-year-old midfielder, who plays club football for Portuguese Premier League side Benfica, made his first appearance for Slovenia in November 1992 against Cyprus. He has since scored a record 34 goals for his country.				 																																	Greensboro: American athletes unanimously backed lifetime bans for steroid offenders here then challenged the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to adopt the policy.				 																																	We just decided to raise the standard and tell the world stop pointing the finger at us  dont even think about it, US sprinter Jon Drummond said.				 																																	USA track and fields athlete advisory committee backed the zero tolerance measure and the career-ending steroid punishment will be voted upon here on Sunday by the full membership at the governing bodys 25th annual convention.				 																																	New Delhi: Ace golfer Jyoti Randhawa shot his third straight round of 70 on Saturday to slip two positions to 17th after the penultimate round in the Nippon golf series in Toyko. 				 																																	Randhawa had an early hiccup when he dropped a shot on the fourth. However, an eagle on the sixth bailed him out and his second bogey on the eighth saw him make the turn at level-par. He then birdied the 16th but a bogey on his closing hole prevented him from breaking-par. 				 																																	Chennai: The newly built LGB 1300cc class, a formula car introduced last week at the launch of the state-of-the-art race track in Coimbatore, would be tested for competition purposes on Sunday.

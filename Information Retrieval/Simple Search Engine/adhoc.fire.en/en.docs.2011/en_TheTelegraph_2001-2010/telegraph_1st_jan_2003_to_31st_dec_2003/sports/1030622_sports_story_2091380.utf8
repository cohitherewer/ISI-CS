The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Sunday, June 22, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 The clouds of uncertainty over one of Mohun Bagans Brazilian recruits were cleared Saturday. Marcos Pereiras travel documents and ticket have been sent, but he would be arriving next Saturday only. He will, thus, miss Mohun Bagans CFL Super Division opener against West Bengal Police which is scheduled for that day.				 																																																	But no headway has yet been made on Jose Ramirez Barreto. Mohun Bagan officials met this evening to discuss ways and means of arranging the money which is due to the playmaker-cum-striker. No ones counting on his presence in the first match, but theres no guarantee either of Barreto reaching the city in time for the July 5 derby against East Bengal. The officials will sit with the three special officers Monday to find a way out. 				 																																																	 The daylong monsoon showers, which threw normal life in the city out of gear, ruined the afternoons football schedule too. None of the 14 Calcutta League matches on the Saturday card  three in first division group B, five in fourth division and six in fifth division  could get underway due to unplayable ground conditions.

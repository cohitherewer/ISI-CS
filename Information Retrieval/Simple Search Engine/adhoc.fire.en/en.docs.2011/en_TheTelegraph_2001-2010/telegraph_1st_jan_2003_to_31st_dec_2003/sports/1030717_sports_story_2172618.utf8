The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Latif retained captain
 Rashid Latif Karachi: Rashid Latif has been retained as Pakistan captain for next months home series against Bangladesh, officials said on Wednesday. The 34-year-old was reprimanded earlier this month for making public a letter he wrote to the ICC about match-fixing. But the PCB chairman Tauqir Zia said in Lahore that Latif would continue as captain unless he suffered a dramatic loss in form or had fitness problems. He has done a good job as captain so far and his performance has also been good. We see no reason to replace him as captain for the series against Bangladesh, said Zia. The PCB had accused Latif of being indiscreet in publicising the letter and confirmed he had violated the Boards code of conduct for players. The PCB asked for a report from the team manager Haroon Rasheed in England on whether Latif took permission before writing and releasing the letter. Haroon confirmed that Latif had discussed the letter he was planning to send to the ICC. As it is there is nothing in his letter to raise fresh suspicions about match-fixing taking place. He has taken no names. It is his personal view on this issue. So we have no problems with him now, the PCB chief said. Latif has been leading Pakistan following the teams unceremonious exit from the 2003 World Cup. Zia also noted that Latif had already apologised to the Board for violating the code and it was accepted.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Imran says SA demand illogical 
 Imran Khan is critical of ICC Faisalabad: Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan on Friday criticised a South African demand to change venues for two matches during a forthcoming tour of Pakistan because of security concerns. I see (the) South African demand (as) illogical after assurances by the Pakistan government that the team would be given highest security, Imran Khan said. The government is the best judge of the security in the country, said Imran, who played 88 Tests and 175 one-day games for Pakistan. Terrorism can take place anywhere in the world and most countries have unpredictable security including South Africa, he said. Imran said the International Cricket Council (ICC) messed up things in this years World Cup. The ICC has failed to play a lead role. Its the ICC who messed up the Zimbabwe issue during the World Cup, he said, referring to Englands pull-out from their match in Harare over security fears. The South African team is due to tour Pakistan from September 22 until October 27 during which they will play three one-dayers and as many Tests. The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) has demanded that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) relocate the matches scheduled for Karachi and Peshawar over security concerns. An UCBSA delegation is due in Pakistan on Sunday to ascertain security and will report back to the board. PCB has already offered South Africa the top level security reserved for state heads during their tour.  (AFP)  Copyright

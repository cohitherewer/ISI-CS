 Greg against over-coaching 
New Delhi: Former Australian captain Greg Chappell believes the role of the coaches should be limited to honing the natural skills of a cricketer and warned that excessive coaching can ruin a players career. Chappell, who is currently in Chennai, feels that too much dissection of technique to put a point across to the player does not prove useful. I am not saying coaching is not required. But excessive coaching can hurt, Chappell, who attended the coaches seminar in Chennai organised by MRF, said over the phone. He added that coaches must aim to develop the natural instincts of the player. To illustrate his point, Chappell gave the examples of Shane Warne and Mike Procter. Someone like Warne would never have been the same had he been coached in an orthodox manner. Similarly, Procter had a wrong-footed action but his body respondedwell. By no means, am I suggesting that coaching is not required. A youngster bowls leg-spin easily because the use of wrists comes naturally. Off-spin, on the other hand, requires methods, he said.

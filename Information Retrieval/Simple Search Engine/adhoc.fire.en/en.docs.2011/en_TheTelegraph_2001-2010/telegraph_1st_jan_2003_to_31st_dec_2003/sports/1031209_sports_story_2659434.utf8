The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Report in February
Durban: The South African Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Monday said the final report on the circumstances surrounding the air crash that killed former captain Hansie Cronje would be released in February. The accident investigator received an external report just a week ago from the US regarding the flux detector, and we are in the process of doing an analysis, said K. C. Marobela, CAAs manager of legal services. According to Marobela, the outstanding report has been received from the components manufacturers, and will be incorporated into the final report, which will be released for public consumption by early February, Sapa news agency reported. The flux detector, a component found on the tip of an aircrafts wing, picks up the magnetic field of the earth, acting like a magnetic compass and interpreting electrical signals into the instrumentation of the aircraft. In August this year, the lead investigator said that in terms of the instrumentation, the flux detector could be considered the last piece of the puzzle. (PTI)  Copyright

 Soma on recovery track
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Aug. 2: Star heptathlete Soma Biswas, who was admitted to Suraksha hospital yesterday with severe viral afflictions and chest congestion, is better on Saturday, doctors at the hospital said. Soma fell ill during the Hyderabad Federation Cup athletics meet and flew into town Thursday morning. He was at the SAI, Eastern Centre sick bay where SAIs Dr Laila Das attended on her, but last morning, her situation not showing any improvement, was removed to hospital. Dr Abhrajit Roy is treating her at the hospital, and RMO, Dr S. Goswami said treatment was on bronchial congestion with cough. The infections were of a high order hence she had the fever which is now gone, she said. The doctor said that even if it wasnt clear when she can resume practice, it can be said that Soma will be out of hospital in the next two-three days. She said it was a delicate affair treating the athlete because we have to go by the banned drug list that has been provided to us in this treatment. Even basic cough syrups are out because it contains the banned codine, and the antibiotics being used are being carefully selected. Soma, though, seems to be out of danger.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Monday, January 06, 2003  Romantic Notes takes all by surprise 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 DanielRomantic Notes, the winner of the Kingfisher Calcutta Derby Stakes at the RCTC Sunday, being admired by the crowd				 						 					Calcutta: Romantic Notes busted the myth that a superior class is anytime better than the power of endurance in a longer classic. The Vijay Singh-trained filly handed a convincing one-length beating to the fancied duo of Nationalistic and Network in the 2,400m Kingfisher Calcutta Derby Stakes on Sunday. The two favourites were thought to be classy horses. S. Shanker partnered the Mischevious Music-Pheasant Heights daughter to victory, his first in the city Derby.				 										The time clocked by the winner  2 mins, 32.9 secs  was fast as Daniel David-trainee Assertive Dancer set a carcking pace to suit her stables prime contender, the 5-2 second favourite Nationalistic. In fact, every thing went to the plans until Romantic Notes gave the field a slip from the third slot and established a two-length lead passing the 600-metre marker. The opposition expected the Khaitan-owned filly to tire herself anywhere near the distance-post but she kicked on leaving Nationalistic, the 5-4 favourite Network, Another Time and Smart Ruler to sort out minor placings. The Alokananda Stakes was lifted by Bharath Singhs trainee Evangeline, also a rank-outsider.

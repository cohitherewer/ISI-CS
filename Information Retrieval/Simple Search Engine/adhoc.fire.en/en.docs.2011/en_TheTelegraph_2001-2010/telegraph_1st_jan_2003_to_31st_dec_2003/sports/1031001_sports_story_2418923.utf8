The Telegraph - Calcutta
 NZ coach hopes to get some practice
 Ashley Ross Rajkot: Exuding confidence, New Zealand coach Ashley Ross on Tuesday said his team could adapt to any condition and was well prepared to take on the Indians in their own backyard. The Black Caps have the ability to adapt to any condition and that is our big strength. Moreover, we have some fond memories of Rajkot as we had won a one-day International against the hosts scoring more than 300 odd runs during our last visit here, Ross said here after a practice session ahead of their second and last tour match before the Test series. Looking forward to the two Tests, Ross said: The Visakhapatnam match (against Board Presidents XI) was the plan a of our preparation. But unfortunately the first two days were washed out and our batsmen did not get a look in. Rajkot match is our plan b and we would like to get as much practice here as possible. However, even if we dont get the much-needed practice over here we are well prepared to take on India in the Test series as we have done our homework quite well. In fact all the players are looking forward to the Ahmedabad Test. Asia is the real place to come for cricket education, he said. Asked whether two spinners  Daniel Vettori and Paul Wiseman  were enough to challenge the strong Indian batting line-up, Ross said New Zealand were relying on their medium pacers to do the job. If the medium pacers can make inroads into the strong Indian batting then there is need for only one spinner. But we have high hopes on Vettori in this tour, Ross said. Ross praised the captaincy of Stephen Fleming and hailed him as one of the best captains today in world cricket.  (PTI)  Copyright

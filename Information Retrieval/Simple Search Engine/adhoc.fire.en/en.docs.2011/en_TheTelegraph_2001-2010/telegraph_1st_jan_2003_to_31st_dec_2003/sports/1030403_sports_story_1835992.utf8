 Kallis pulls out of tour to Bangla
Cape Town: South African allrounder Jacques Kallis has withdrawn from the tour of Bangladesh because of an illness in his family. Although Kallis was not immediately available for comment, it is known that his father has been ill for some time. Our thoughts are with Jacques at this difficult time and we wish him well, United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) chief executive Gerald Majola said in a media statement on Wednesday. Should his circumstances allow it and he wishes to join up with the team later in the tour, he will be welcome to. South Africa confirmed on Tuesday the tour would go ahead after receiving assurances over the teams security. The war in Iraq had prompted speculation it might be cancelled.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

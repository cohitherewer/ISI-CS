The Telegraph - Calcutta
 New committee in Iraq soon
London: Iraqs Olympic body will be dissolved and replaced by a new group with no links to the torture and other abuses which took place under Saddam Husseins regime, the IOC said. The IOC ethics commission made the recommendations after investigating allegations that the Iraqi committee  headed by Saddams elder son Odai  brutalised and jailed athletes. The committees headquarters in Baghdad were largely destroyed in US-led bombing raids in the early days of the Iraq war. There have been no confirmed sightings of Saddam or his son since the collapse of the regime. IOC president Jacques Rogge said the proposals would be submitted to the IOC executive board next week in Madrid.  (AP)  Copyright

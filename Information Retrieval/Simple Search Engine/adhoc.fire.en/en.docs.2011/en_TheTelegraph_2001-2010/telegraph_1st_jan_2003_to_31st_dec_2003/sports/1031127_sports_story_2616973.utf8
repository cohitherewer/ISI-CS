 Smith keen to patch up with Klusener
Durban: South African captain Graeme Smith is keen to patch up his differences with Lance Klusener. The United Cricket Board of South Africa actually banned me from communicating with Lance while the legal action was going on between them. But he is clearly now back in the national selectors thoughts and it is important that we sit down and sort the matter out, Smith said when asked about Kluseners comeback for a friendly tie. Klusener has been asked to captain the Nicky Oppenheimer XI against the touring West Indians in Johannesburg next week. He has also been selected to play for an invitation side against Western Province in Cape Town in the coming weekend. I think we are both adult enough to handle the situation... We will be playing cricket against each other in less than two weeks time, he said. The UCBSA has given me Lances number and I will be contacting him in the next two days. When I criticised his personality, I was dealing with only one small aspect, Smith said. Smith had called Klusener a bad influence. (AFP)  Copyright

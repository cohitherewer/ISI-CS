 Ronaldo just wants to go on and on
 Ronaldo completed 10 years as a pro at the weekend Paris: World and European Player of the Year Ronaldo has bad news for defenders. He cannot see the day he wants to hang up his boots. The 26-year-old Brazil striker celebrated his tenth year as professional footballer Saturday with a two-goal display against Valencia that put Real Madrid one point behind leaders Real Sociedad in the Spanish championship. And he said on his personal website Monday he was looking forward to a long future. Ronaldo was just 16 when he made his debut for Rio de Janeiro side Cruzeiro in the Brazilian championship on May 25, 1993. And in ten years he has become most precious possession. I hope I will have a long future ahead And as long as he is happy playing he plans to carry on terrorising defences. I have still got a big future ahead of me and I am planning on playing football for as long as I continue to enjoy it. It was a Ronaldo hattrick that knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League but an injury prevented him from getting to grips with the Italian defenders when Juventus eliminated the title-holders in the semi-finals. Ronaldos goals won a fifth World Cup for Brazil last year when he capped a tremendous comeback from a serious knee injury that had threatened to end his career. It brings back very strong emotions to think of my debut with Cruzeiro when I was only 16, he said. Ten years have passed since then, but so much has happened to me that it seems like 20.

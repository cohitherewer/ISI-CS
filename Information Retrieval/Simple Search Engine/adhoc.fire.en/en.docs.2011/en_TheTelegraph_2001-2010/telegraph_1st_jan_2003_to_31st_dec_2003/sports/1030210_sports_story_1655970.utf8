The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Skipper pleads for Murali breather
 Murali Bloemfontein: Sri Lankan skipper Sanath Jayasuriya has called for breathing space for his star off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, saying that a claustrophobic amount of interest was putting undue pressure on him. Muralidharan has come under media scrutiny once again following another controversial tour of Australia as the bowler battles a series of injuries to return to top form. The affable Murali has been kept in protective custody by the tour management who have refused media access to the record-breaking bowler. Murali is under a lot of pressure and is copping a lot of stick from the press, Jayasuriya said. Im really not sure what people want from him. If they want to try and take him down and destroy one of Sri Lankas greatest ever cricketers, theyre going the right way about it. He wants to win the World Cup, so do we, and it is affecting him. The blanket ban by the countrys sports minister on all Lankan players from speaking to the media follows a scathing attack by Muralidharan on the national selectors, the Sri Lankan cricket board, and teammates on national television following a disastrous tour of England last summer. Hes taken a few things personally and its hard not to. He realises hes in the public eye and hes big news all the time, but sometimes you can destroy him if you go too far, Jayasuriya said. It is a very big tournament, and we want to gradually ease him in. We dont want to put too much pressure on him by getting him to do all the workload, the Sri Lankan captain said. He a fantastic bowler and he wants the ball in his hand all the time. It is very hard to take the ball out of his hand in a tough situation because he wants to be in the thick of things.

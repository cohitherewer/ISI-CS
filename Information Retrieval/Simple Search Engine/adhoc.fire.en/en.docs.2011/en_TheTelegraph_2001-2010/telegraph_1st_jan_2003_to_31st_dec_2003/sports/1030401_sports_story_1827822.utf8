 Karthikeyan off podium
New Delhi: Natures fury combined with technical failure forced Indias ace driver Narain Karthikeyan out of the first Superfund World Series race IN Jarama, Spain Sunday. Braving the adverse circuit conditions arising out of torrential rain and a damaged rear brake, Karthikeyan was powering his way to a second place finish when he spun out of control and retired midway through the race. Frenchman Franck Montagny drove splendidly to win the race which saw only half the field touch the finishing line, according to a media release from Tata Carlin Motorsports, Karthikeyans racing team. The Indian had a difficult time even during the warm-up laps when in an effort to familiarise himself with the rainy conditions he hit stagnant water and damaged the rear of his car. Although Tata-RC were able to replace the rear wing, they had no time to work on the damaged rear brake. In the circumstances, Karthikeyan did a remarkable job until the brake pressure ultimately malfunctioned and brought the car to a grinding halt after eight laps. I was not pushing too hard when I spun off, as I had a good lead over Enrique Bernoldi who was in third place. The brakes were damaged in the warm-up spin, and there was nothing I could do to avoid going off because we did not have enough time to repair it, Karthikeyan said.  (PTI)  Copyright

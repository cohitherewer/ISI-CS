The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bracewell takes over in Nov.
Christchurch: Gloucestershires director of cricket John Bracewell was named New Zealands new coach on Friday. The former New Zealand off-spinner will take over in November from Denis Aberhart after finishing the season with his County side. Assistant coach Ashley Ross will take the team on the Test and one-day tours of India and Pakistan. The managers role will change hands as well. With ex-NZ captain Jeff Crowe having stepped down, former Auckland Cricket chief executive Lindsay Crocker has been named as his replacement. Crocker played first-class cricket in New Zealand for Northern Districts and also played professionally in England and South Africa. The often fiery Bracewell, described in his playing days as a spin bowler with the fast bowlers attitude, has forged a successful coaching career, beginning with Auckland before steering Gloucestershire to six County trophies in five years. As a batsman, Bracewell hit his one and only Test century against England at Trent Bridge in 1986 and in all scored 1,001 Test runs at an average of 20.42, including four half-centuries.

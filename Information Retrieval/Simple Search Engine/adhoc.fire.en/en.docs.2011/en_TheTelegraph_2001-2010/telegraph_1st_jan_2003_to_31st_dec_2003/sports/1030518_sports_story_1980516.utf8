 Selectors unhappy with perks
New Delhi, May 17 (PTI): Some members of the current national selection committee are of the opinion that the BCCI is not providing them with enough benefits. We are paid a TA/DA of Rs 5,000 per match we cover, including Rs 4,000 for accommodation. But we do not get salary from the Board. There is another issue. While the cricketers stay in five-star hotels, we do not have the financial leeway to do the same which affects our authority, a current national selector said. The selector also pointed out their inability to go beyond the Boards brief has set up impediments in fulfilling their roles. We only cover matches which the BCCI asks us to do, that is, two Deodhar and two Duleep, and a handful of Ranji games. Another selector pointed out such limitations at times can let a few talented cricketers slip away from their net. We would select the India A side to tour England in June, but none of us were asked to cover the Boards under-25 tournament. Also, take the case of a talent like Ambati Rayudu. We might follow him in a couple of games in which he has failed. Then how can we make up our mind on him, he argued.  Copyright

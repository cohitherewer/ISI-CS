The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Symonds to miss NZ match too
Port Elizabeth: Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds has been ruled out of Tuesdays game against New Zealand. Symonds, who has a groin strain, had an encouraging fitness test on Sunday but Australia decided not to risk him. Team physiotherapist Errol Alcott said: Hes coming along well...but weve decided to hold him back from Tuesdays game. We are optimistic hes going to be available for Saturdays (final Super Six) game against Kenya. A win over New Zealand will allow the Australians to equal a record nine consecutive World Cup wins by Clive Lloyds side between 1975 and 1979. Vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said avoiding New Zealand has been discussed at length. Im sure those conditions will suit their type of bowling, Gilchrist acknowledged. That comes into play later on for the semis. Theres no hiding there are certain teams in the wash-up at the moment youd prefer to play, given their records. Gilchrist was thinking of possibly playing either Kenya or Sri Lanka in the semi-final. It looks in all probability that India will finish second in the Super Six, thus avoiding a semi-final clash against Australia. Australia hammered Sourav Gangulys side by nine wickets when the two met at Centurion early in Group A, but the Indians havent lost since. Thats part of it now. Youve got to realise that, Gilchrist said. We want to finish top of the whole thing, but even thats not a major issue. (Agencies)  Copyright

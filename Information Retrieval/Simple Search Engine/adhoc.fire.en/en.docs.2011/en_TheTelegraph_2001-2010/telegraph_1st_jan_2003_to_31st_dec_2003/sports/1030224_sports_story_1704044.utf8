The Telegraph - Calcutta
 John Davison record in lost cause
Centurion: Brian Lara and Wavell Hinds destroyed Canadas bowling on Sunday with an awesome display of hitting to steer West Indies to a crushing seven-wicket win in World Cup Group B. Canada opener John Davison had struck the fastest World Cup century in history to set up his sides total of 202, but Lara made a sparkling 73 and Hinds 64 to help their team to their target with nearly 30 overs to spare. Man-of-the-Match Davison, reached his hundred off just 67 balls and finished with 111, but his efforts were in vain as the minnows lost their last nine wickets for just 47 runs. It was a great experience, awesome Davison said. It was West Indies first victory of the tournament since they beat South Africa in the opening match and they will reach the Super Sixes with wins in their next two games against Kenya and Sri Lanka. Lara and Hinds quickly put West Indies in control with a century partnership in just 36 minutes. Lara belted eight fours and five sixes while Hinds cracked 10 fours and three sixes before both threw their wickets away, leaving Ramnaresh Sarwan (42 not out) and Carl Hooper (five not out) to finish the job. Hinds registered the fastest half-century of the tournament from 24 balls, only to see Lara reach the mark in 23 deliveries when he smashed 26 runs off Barry Seebarans only over. Drakes, who conceded 29 from his first two overs, returned to mop up the tail and finish with figures of five for 44.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

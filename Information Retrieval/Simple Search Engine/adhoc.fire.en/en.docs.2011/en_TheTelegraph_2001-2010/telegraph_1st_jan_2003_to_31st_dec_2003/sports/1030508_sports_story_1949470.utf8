The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Inter hold AC Milan goalless
Milan: A resolute Inter Milan held AC Milan goalless in the first-leg of the Champions League semi-final Wednesday. Milan went on the rampage in the second half, searching for the elusive winner, but the lack of finishing in the penetrative zone let them down. Inter, on the other hand, were happy to play a waiting game and go into their home encounter all square. The best chances of a high-paced first half both fell to Inter striker Alvaro Recoba who should have done better in the seventh minute when he latched on to a neat flick from Hernan Crespo but shot weakly at Milan keeper Dida. Uruguayan Recoba lacked power again ten minutes later when, unmarked, he headed a Sergio Conceicao cross softly into the arms of the Brazilian keeper. In between those efforts from Recoba, Milan had gone close through Andriy Shevchenko who forced a save out of Francesco Toldo with a shot from the left of the penalty area after being set up by Georgian full back Kakha Kaladze. Milan, produced the better football of the opening 45 minutes with their Portuguese playmaker Rui Costa alert and creative in midfield.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

																								Washington: Olympic 100 metres champion Maurice Greene threw down the gauntlet to world record holder Tim Montgomery on Wednesday, declaring he would be taking back the mark he lost last September to his fellow American.																								The 28-year-old known as the Kansas Comet said there would be no repeat of his dreadful season last year when he lost not only his record which had stood since 1999 but also was made to look ordinary by Montgomery and Britains European 100m champion Dwain Chambers.																								However, Greene said Montgomerys mark of 9.78 seconds would not be around for long. I am going to run 9.7 dead at least three times this season, the ever-confident Greene said.																								That would leave him just one tenth of a second off the mark  9.6  which he has said would push him into retirement.																								Greenes less than friendly rivalry with 27-year-old Montgomery bubbled to the surface again during the conference call organised by USA Track and Field (USATF).																								I acknowledge he (Montgomery) is the world record holder but he is not the fastest man in the world. The fastest is still me! Anyway he doesnt have any Olympic or world titles, said the three-time world outdoor champion. (AFP)

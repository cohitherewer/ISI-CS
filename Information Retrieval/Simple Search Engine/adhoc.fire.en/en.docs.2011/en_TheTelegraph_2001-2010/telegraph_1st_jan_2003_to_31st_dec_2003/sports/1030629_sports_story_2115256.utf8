The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wife flays selection
London, June 28 (AFP): The distraught wife of Cameroon footballer Marc-Vivien Foe, who collapsed during the Confederations Cup semi-final on Thursday and later died, has hit out at her husbands selection for the game. A post mortem on the 28-year-old Foe ruled out a heart attack as the cause of death and Foes wife Marie-Louise has revealed that her husband had been experiencing gastric problems in the days leading up to the tragedy. He should not have been playing at all, said the 26-year-old as she wept, recalling how he had seen a doctor on the day of the match. But doctors should have stopped him. Hed had dysentry for two or three days. Hed had gastric problems and he knew he probably wasnt well enough to play. When he collapsed I never for a moment thought he would die. I assumed hed get up and walk away. The family is in utter shock.  Copyright

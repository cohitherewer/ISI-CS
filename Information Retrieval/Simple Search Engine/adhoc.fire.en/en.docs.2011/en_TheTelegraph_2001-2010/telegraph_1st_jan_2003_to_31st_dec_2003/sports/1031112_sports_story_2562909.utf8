 Chaos as Anna arrives in Mumbai
Mumbai: Russian tennis and beauty sensation Anna Kournikova arrived here in the early hours of Tuesday amid chaos and confusion caused by her personal security guards at the Chattrapati Shivaji International Airport. The 22-year-old player is here as a brand ambassador for Sahara India Pariwar and will be part of its I love Amby Valley project. Mediapersons and photographers, who had gathered at the airport, were stopped by her eight personal security guards from speaking to the tennis star, leading to a lot of confusion. Later, Kournikova, more famous for her looks than her on-field exploits, was whisked away to Amby Valley in Lonavala in a luxury car even as a heated argument ensued between her security guards and the media. Sahara officials later said that Kournikova will be back in Mumbai on Friday to meet the press after attending commercial shoots in Amby Valley for the next couple of days. Kournikova was flown into Mumbai after her three-day promotional tour in Thailand and Indonesia recently. Kournikova claimed just one victory on the WTA Tour during the 2003 season, beating Slovakias Henrieta Nagyova in the first round of the Australian Open in January. (Agencies)  Copyright

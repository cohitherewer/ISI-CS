The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tolly, Churchill 0-0
Margao: Tollygunge Agragami put up a spirited performance to hold Churchill Brothers goalless in a National Football League match here Monday. The match was mostly confined to the midfield with Tollygunge showing a lot of promise in the initial stages. Jiten Rai and Akeem Abolanle worked in tandem upfront to put the rival defence under pressure. But they failed to make it into the penetrative zone with Churchill defender Osumanu Hussaini playing a stellar role. For the Goa side, Yusif Yakubu did put the ball into the Tollygunge net once midway through the first session, but referee Arjunan pulled him up for infringement. Later, Yakubu set Kingley up inside the box but the latter shot over. After the change of ends, Churchill showed more urgency in their attack and had the rival defence under pressure in the last quarter. They had a great chance to score when substitute Afonso Francis sent a cross to unmarked Ratan Singh inside the box who failed to connect.  JCT win 3-0 JCT started their campaign in style beating a hapless Indian Bank 3-0 in Chennai. The Punjab team took the lead in the 12th minute through Stephen Abarowei . Seven minutes later, Vijayans through was slotted in by Sukhjinder Singh while Chanranjit Singh rounded off the tally in the 69th minute.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Boris Becker biography in November
Munich: Three-time Wimbledon winner Boris Becker is following a trend among German celebrities and will publish a biography. The 352-page book will hit stores in early November, Bertelsmann Publishers announced on Monday, with a title still to be decided. The book, written with the help of advisers, will be heavy on photos, but Becker wasnt saying if it would have the tell-all gossipy quality of other celebrity books. German soccer hero Stefan Effenberg used his book I showed them all, which hit No. 1, to settle scores with rivals from his days with Bayern Munich. If you are talking about how to market a book, then Effenbergs strategy was right, Becker said. I have problems, however, with his gutter talk. Beckers book will cost $ 22.40. Meanwhile, Becker faces a fresh battle with tax officials, after authorities in Munich said on Monday that he still owed them taxes from his winnings. A newspaper report put the amount he supposedly owes, which dates back to the 1990s, as high as 660,000 euros ($746,000).  (AP)  Copyright

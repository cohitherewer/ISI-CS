The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI for action against England, NZ
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Durban: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to club England and New Zealands refusal to play in Harare and Nairobi, respectively, with the Player Terms dispute. The BCCI has made a formal representation and the ICC will have to take a decision at its two-day Executive Board meeting (Friday onwards), in Johannesburg, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. The Terms issue (involving Indian cricketers), it may be recalled, was put on hold in January to facilitate the top guns participation in the ongoing World Cup. Besides the Terms dispute, the Board will discuss the Harare and Nairobi bit, as also the structural and financial proposals specific to Kenyas application for Test status. On the agenda, too, is a review of the ICC Test Championship format and the anti-corruption reports from the Code of Conduct Commission chairman, Michael Beloff.  Copyright

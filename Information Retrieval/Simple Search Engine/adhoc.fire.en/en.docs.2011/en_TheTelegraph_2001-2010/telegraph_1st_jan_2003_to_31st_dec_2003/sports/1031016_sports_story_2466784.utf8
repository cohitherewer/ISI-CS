The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I feel nervous and under pressure, says Moin
Lahore: Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan says he is extremely nervous about his comeback against South Africa on Friday after being out of international cricket for 30 months. Right now I feel the same way that I felt when I was preparing to play my first match for Pakistan  nervous and under pressure, the former Pakistan captain said on Wednesday following his recall for the first Test in Lahore. It is never easy making a comeback to international cricket after a long lay-off. Your credibility and reputation is on line and there are high expectations. Moin, 32, was sacked as captain and player after a disappointing tour of New Zealand in March 2001 after playing 63 Tests and 190 one-dayers. Since then the selectors have preferred Rashid Latif over him, but Latif pulled out of the Tests against South Africa last week. I have played regular domestic cricket and have trained hard. This should help me. But it is not going to be an easy comeback against South Africa, Moin said. He added he had never given up hope of playing for Pakistan again despite being ignored completely.

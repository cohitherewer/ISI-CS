The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Owen may stay on at Liverpool 
		 Owen is due to have talks  with officialsLondon: England striker Michael Owen is ready to extend his stay at Liverpool but wants the club to prove it can overtake Manchester United and Arsenal. Owen, who has 22 months left on his current 60,000 a week deal, confirmed that talks are scheduled with the Liverpool board. The club has indicated they are ready to talk. We havent set a date yet, but I am sure we will discuss things soon. Manager Gerard Houllier is desperate to keep Owen at Anfield after he underlined his importance to Liverpool once more with two goals in the 3-0 Merseyside Derby win at Everton. But the 23-year-old Owen has hinted he wants positive proof that Liverpool will be genuine title contenders before he commits himself to another long-term contract. Of course, being in the Champions League is important. I belong there and so do Liverpool, he says. A last match defeat to Chelsea last season deprived Liverpool of Champions League football this term. And Liverpools defensive style has left him starved of service. You are only as good as the service you get. All strikers need chances and it had been hard not having a single sight of goal in those opening games, he says. (AFP)  Copyright

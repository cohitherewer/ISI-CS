The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Perry preferred as cheerleader
  Matthew Perry at Wimbledon Tuesday London: Jennifer Capriati really appreciated Friends TV star Matthew Perry being her Wimbledon cheerleader but she drew the line at practising with the actor.Hes been great, Capriati said of her friends valued support. I think he jumped out of his seat a few times quite high, she said after her titanic struggle with defending champion Serena Williams.Perry, currently appearing on the London stage in Sexual Perversity in Chicago, was himself a promising young tennis player in Canada before leaving for Hollywood.Asked if she had practised with him, Capriati jokingly replied: No, no, no, no. My confidence  I dont want to get it down playing with him. No singing in the rain: Wimbledon tennis fans gazed nervously at the cloudy skies as British pop veterans Cliff Richard and Cilla Black took their places in the Royal Box on Centre Court on Tuesday.For Cliff Richard famously launched into an impromptu singalong on tennis most famous stage to raise morale during a lengthy rainbreak back in 1996.He invited fellow singer Cilla Black to join him at Wimbledon this year but she warned in advance: I have already told him Im not going to sing if it rains. l Tracking aces: The Wimbledon umpires had IBM officials scratching their heads after the computer company calculated that Mark Philippoussis had fired down 46 aces in his victory against Andre Agassi on Monday.The umpire wrote down 45 so IBM went back to double-check as 46 equalled the record mark set by Goran Ivanisevic in 1997.We wanted to be certain that we were right, an IBM spokeswoman said. We had a video of the match and we fast forwarded it to check all the Philippoussis serves.The umpire is under no obligation to put the aces on his score card but we wanted to be sure as it was a joint record. l Non-adventurous champions: Short, back and sides is the order of the day for aspiring Wimbledon champions visiting the tournament hair salon, said hairdresser Suzanne Strong.They are not very adventurous with their hair styles. If they are playing well, nothing changes until that run of luck has come to an end, she said.They would never change a hairstyle between matches because they are very superstitious.Favourites in the salon over the years have been Australian Pat Rafter and Ivanisevic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 If a keeper succumbs to pressure, the team collapses
Rashid Latif proud of having stirred up the match-fixing issue FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Centurion: Critics have found it difficult writing off Rashid Latif. But, then, he has always been solid behind the stumps (112 victims in 34 Tests and 191 in 147 ODIs). Now, of course, Latif is at the end of his career. He has few regrets, though.Latif, a former captain with roots in UPs Sultanpur district, spoke to The Telegraph the other evening. He didnt dwell at length on some of the sticky issues, yet answered all questions in the limited time available.The following are excerptsOn quitting Test cricket but continuing to play the ODIsI quit because of a neck injury... In fact, Im quitting altogether after the World Cup... The injury occurred while practising in 1998 and, at different times, played up.On whether its been easy deciding to quit all formsItne saal khelne ke baad... Mushkil tha... But, family reasons also contributed. Ive neglected them and, now, its time to be with my wife and three children. At 34, Im not getting any younger either. Who will succeed me? Weve already had a youngster (Kamran Akmal) keeping in the Tests and, then, theres Moin Khan... Its possible that he will be back.On life after cricket(Laughs) I already run an academy in Karachi and will expand that. On his pre-World Cup thoughtsBas, yehi sooch ke aaye ki accha perform karen... It will be nice to sign off on a high. This isnt just my last tournament, but could be that for Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar as well. (After a pause) Of course, as a team, we should have done better.On a chequered career  quitting out of disgust (1996), making a return and getting the captaincy and, then, being in and outIts all my destiny... Aur hum kya kahen? However, I must place on record the support from teammates at different times. Their help made it easier each time I made a comeback.On the lessons learntThat cricket is the best vehicle for lifting your countrys image... That exposure to different places and people makes you a better individual... That you get the opportunity of making a name... On whether he felt uncomfortable on his comeback after retirement (1997-98)Not really... I did have differences known to everybody but, after wearing the Pakistan cap, the differences disappear... It helped that I had the backing of the PCB. On the match-fixing issue raised by himJo hona tha, ho gaya... But, yes, Im proud of having made it an issue... As is known, inquiries were held... On whether he was under pressureI was... It wasnt an easy period, but I stood by what I thought was right... I did have to make sacrifices but, frankly, I dont have much of a regret.On the complete wicketkeeperJeffrey Dujon. He always gave the impression of having been born a keeper... He would dive beautifully and had that smart style. Effective to woh the, dekhne mein bhi bahut accha lagta tha. Remember, if a keeper succumbs to pressure, the team collapses... Poori team baith jati hai. A keeper with character is one who will recover from a missed chance and bring off a couple of brilliant dismissals. A keeper alone can cancel out his own mistakes. On the current lot(Smiles) Theres a big difference between Adam Gilchrist and Mark Boucher and the rest.. Both are streets ahead and have the mental toughness to prosper. On India getting Rahul Dravid to keep in the ODIsIts a compromise to get the balance right... Only, what if he gets injured and India lose one of the best batters around? India should get a specialist who can also bat in the top six... Have I seen Parthiv Patel? Very little... He does have the potential, lekin kaafi mehnat karni ho gi... What Ive noticed about most Indian keepers is that their hands are together when they rise to the fast bowlers. That, in my opinion, affects the ability to dive... Balance phir theek nahin rahta. The hands, therefore, should be free. I keep saying this to our young keepers too. Finally, on being rated in the top three (with Gilchrist and Boucher) by world record-holder Ian HealyIts nice of him to have picked me... However, its not the ratings or rankings that has driven me throughout my career... Doing well for Pakistan has been the sole  Copyright

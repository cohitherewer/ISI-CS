The Telegraph - Calcutta
 27th crown for Mahesh
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Max Mirnyi and Mahesh Bhupathi Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi had a cakewalk in the mens doubles final of the $525,000 Estoril Open Saturday. According to information received here, the top seeds beat Argentine pair Lucas Arnold and Mariano Hood 6-1, 6-2. This was their third straight-set win after a tough Round I against Spaniards David Sanchez and Alex-Lopez Moron. Bhupathis 27th career doubles title was his second with the Belarussian. Bhupathi and Mirnyi, who earned $25,300 and 35 points, had made five finals last year but only won the US Open. The two, who began playing together last April after Bhupathi split with Leander Paes, had a prolific 2002 but chose not to start this season as a team as Mirnyi eyed an improvement in singles ranking. He changed his decision recently and will play with Bhupathi at least till Wimbledon. Bhupathi had a nightmarish first quarter as his partnership with Joshua Eagle flopped. This was the Indians first title of the year.  Copyright

		 Wednesday, January 22, 2003 				 Kapil reposes faith in Sourav
																								Guwahati: Legendary all rounder Kapil Dev on Tuesday reposed faith in the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly, saying the team had done well under him and the collective failure on the New Zealand tour did not warrant a change in leadership.																								One should not criticise Sourav because he and his team did not fare well in one series but rather hope that the team does well in the World Cup, Kapil told reporters here.																								The team has done well under Souravs captaincy earlier and there is every reason to believe that it should happen again, he said.  (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ill play with fingers crossed, says Sourav
 BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Calcutta: Having been advised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to undertake the Dhaka trip, despite a bad back, captain Sourav Ganguly intends playing all the April 11-20 tri-series matches there. The squad departs Wednesday, with India scheduled to play both hosts Bangladesh and South Africa twice. Once Im going, I might as well play every game and keep fingers crossed In any case, once the tournament is over, there will be a break till mid-August (Asia Cup), Sourav told The Telegraph soon after returning from New Delhi late Monday evening. As reported in Mondays edition, the BCCI advised the captain not to do a Sachin Tendulkar or a Rahul Dravid as, among other things, the image of Indian cricket would have taken a beating. After all, five frontline players (including Dravid and Sachin) had made themselves unavailable even before the national selectors met in Mumbai last Wednesday to pick the XV-strong squad. Souravs back problem is not a new development  only, it has been playing up more after a mishap at the Chepauk (during the West Indies Test) last October. Incidentally, the captain was all praise for President A.P.J. Abdul Kalams knowledge and graciousness. In a nice gesture, the President hosted a reception (over tea, Monday) for the World Cup squad even though crickets No. 1 trophy was again taken by the Australians. According to a bowled-over Sourav, President Kalam smiled and gently said: Please dont bother I know all the names when he began the customary introductions of teammates. And, yes, the very pucca President congratulated Team India for making the World Cup final. Well done, was his theme for the evening. The captain, of course, had to excuse himself a trifle early as he was booked on the evening flight to Calcutta.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Even Indians at it, accepts Gavaskar
	 - THE GREAT SLEDGING DEBATE Sydney, Aug. 2 (PTI): After attacking the Australians for sledging, legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has said even Indians are indulging in on-field personal abuse these days. Australians may be the worst behaved, but other teams also needed to pull up their act, said Gavaskar and even criticised the umpires for turning a blind eye to such abuse. I would say the Australians have perhaps been more known for it (sledging), not that the other teams are not doing it, Gavaskar said in an interview to the Sydney Morning Herald. Maybe not Bangladesh, maybe not Sri Lanka. But even India, sadly, has resorted to personal abuse, said the Indian master when asked if his recent comments on sledging in a speech at Lords was directed only against Australia. Gavaskar said that Australia under Allan Border and Mark Taylor did not indulge in personal abuse but the same could not be said about the current team. I think I played more than 10 or 15 Test matches against the Australians and excepting the last in Australia in 1986, there was never any abuse directed at me. So I certainly think its more modern. Theres been absolutely no complaint about the Australians under Mark Taylor, no complaints about the Australians under Allan Border. That tells you a story. Gavaskar said Waugh needed to have a look at the reputation his team has and do something about it. I think it is something Waugh can do something about... its entirely possible for him to step in and tell the offenders: Guys, I dont think this is part of the game. I think you should cut it out, he said.  Copyright

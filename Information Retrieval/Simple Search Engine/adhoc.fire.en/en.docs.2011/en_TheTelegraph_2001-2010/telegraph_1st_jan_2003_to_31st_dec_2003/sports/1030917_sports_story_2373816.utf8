				 																																	Rome: Serie A could soon have its first female player if Perugia president Luciano Gaucci finds one with the right attributes, according to Italian media reports on Tuesday.				 																																	I dont see why a woman cant play, Gaucci was quoted as saying in Corriere dello Sport. Theres no law against it, added the controversial president, who made headlines in June when he signed Al-Saadi Gaddafi, son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.				 																																	Two women have already been identified by Perugias scouts as having the necessary qualities to join the Italian outfit. Swedish striker Hanna Ljunberg and Norwegian midfielder Solveig Gulbrandsen are both internationals for their respective countries. While its forbidden for men to play in the womens championship, theres no rule to prevent a female playing in the male one, said Gaucci. 				 																																	London: Ferraris Michael Schumacher may be still two races away from a record sixth Formula One championship, but according to his teams official website he has already won it.				 																																	Under the Germans biographical details, the website www.ferrari.com lists Schumachers achievements in the Titles won section as six drivers world championships, with the 2003 crown the last of them.				 																																	Schumacher won Sundays Italian Grand Prix for his 50th win with Ferrari, leaving him three points clear of Williams Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya with 20 points still available from the US and Japanese Grands Prix.				 																																	McLarens Kimi Raikkonen also remains in championship contention, seven points behind Schumacher in the closest title battle in years. 				 																																	London: British sports minister Richard Caborn is to ask Sky TV to share live television coverage of Englands potentially explosive Euro 2004 against Turkey with a terrestrial broadcaster in a last-ditch attempt to dissuade fans from travelling to Istanbul.				 																																	As a result of representations from colleagues, we will approach broadcasters to share the match for this unique one-off occasion, Caborn told The Daily Telegraph.				 																																	The Football Association has declined their ticket allocation for the October 11 match in Istanbul and advised England fans not to travel in a bid to avoid a repeat of the trouble which marred the meeting between the two sides in Sunderland in April.

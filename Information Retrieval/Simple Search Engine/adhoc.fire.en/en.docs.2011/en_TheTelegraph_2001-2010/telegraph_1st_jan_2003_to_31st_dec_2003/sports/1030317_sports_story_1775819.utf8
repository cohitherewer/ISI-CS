 Gary Kirsten retires from ODIs
 Kirsten Cape Town: Opener Gary Kirsten became the third member of South Africas World Cup squad to retire from international one-day cricket on Sunday. Kirsten, 35, joins Allan Donald and Jonty Rhodes in retirement from the squad who failed to get past the first round. He will continue to be considered for Tests. Allrounder Lance Klusener has been rested from international cricket and was not included in a 14-man squad named on Sunday to play in Sharjah and Bangladesh next month. Graeme Smith, who replaces the sacked Shaun Pollock, will lead a side containing five players who were not selected for the World Cup. The 22-year-old Smith was officially named captain at a news conference in Cape Town Sunday. Fast bowler Monde Zondeki was involved in a car accident on Saturday and is expected to be out of action for a month with an injured left shoulder. THE SQUAD Graeme Smith (capt.), Paul Adams, Mark Boucher, Allan Dawson, Boeta Dippenaar, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Jacques Kallis, Neil McKenzie, Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Rudolph, Charl Willoughby.

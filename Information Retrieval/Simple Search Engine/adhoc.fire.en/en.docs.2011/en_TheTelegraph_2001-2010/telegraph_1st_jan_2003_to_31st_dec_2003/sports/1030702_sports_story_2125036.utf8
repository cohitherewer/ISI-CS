 Foes body handed over to family
Lyon: The body of Cameroon midfielder Marc-Viven Foe has been returned to his family for mourning ceremonies in Lyon before it is flown to his native country to be buried. Foe, who was 28, died after collapsing during his countrys semi-final victory over Colombia in the Confederations Cup last Thursday. A mass will be said for the midfielder in Lyons St Jean cathedral on Thursday and fans will be allowed to pay him a last homage on Wednesday afternoon, soccer club Olympique Lyon said on their website on Tuesday. His body will then be flown to Paris and Cameroon on Saturday with Foes teammates on board the plane. Toxicology tests done as part of the autopsy have been handed to an expert in Geneva for analysis and the results will be known late this week or early next week, Lyons prosecutors office said. Foe played for Manchester City on loan but still belonged to Olympique Lyon and the French champions were all shell-shocked by the news of his death. Club president Jean-Michel Aulas decided that Foes shirt number of 17 will from now on be removed from the teams line-up.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

																								Lahore: Pakistan captain Waqar Younis warned that his under-performing team should not be written off as contenders for the cricket World Cup.																								Speaking on Thursday, the eve of their departure for South Africa, Waqar said: I was surprised to read some analysis in South Africa where people have written us off even from the Super Sixes stage. 																								Its a wrong impression and with the focus on the cup we are among the top contenders.																								The Pakistan Cricket Board hosted a send-off ceremony for the team at the Gaddafi Stadium here late in the day. (AFP)

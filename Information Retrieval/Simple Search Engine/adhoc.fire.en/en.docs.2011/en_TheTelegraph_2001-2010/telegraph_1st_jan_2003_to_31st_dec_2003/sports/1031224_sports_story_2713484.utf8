 Light halts Pak charge 
 - Sami rips through NZ top-order before Test ends in draw  Mohammed Sami in action in Hamilton on Tuesday Hamilton: New Zealand escaped with a draw against Pakistan in the first Test on Tuesday when bad light stopped play after tea on the fifth day, with the hosts struggling on 96 for eight. Once the players left the field, rain stopped Pakistans push for a late, if unlikely, victory. After the first session of the day was lost to rain, the sides were given a total of 75 overs to bowl and Pakistan wasted little time putting the hosts under pressure with Mohammed Sami leading the attack. Sami had taken five for 44, leaving the home side with a lead of 196 with two wickets and 35.5 overs remaining. When New Zealand resumed their second innings with a lead of 104, chances of a result seemed remote. However, Sami removed Lou Vincent Stephen Fleming, Scott Styris, Robbie Hart and Daniel Vettori apart from running out Craig McMillan. Umar Gul chipped in with the wickets of Mark Richardson and Chris Cairns. We could have done better, Pakistan coach Javed Miandad said. We didnt push on when we had them at 52 for seven. That was the time we should have gone for the kill and we would have won the game. Fleming said the New Zealand players had discussed how they were going to use the 105 overs originally available to them but with that reduced to 75 because of morning drizzle, the equation had changed. We knew then that the only team that could win was Pakistan, Fleming said. And that played on us and there was a definite shift in our minds. We didnt help the situation by playing some poor shots, but youve got to hand it to Sami after the way he bowled in the first innings.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Time for Steve to go, feels Thommo
 Experts feel Steve should make way for the future Melbourne: Former Australia Test players Jeff Thomson and David Hookes say captain Steve Waugh should retire to allow the team to build for the future, Australias newspapers said on Monday. Its time to move on and its a good time to do it when the opposition isnt that good, Thomson was quoted as saying in the Herald Sun and Daily Telegraph newspapers. Top-ranked Australia host bottom-ranked Bangladesh in a two-Test series in Darwin and Cairns next month. Whats he going to prove if he plays Bangladesh? Who cares if Steve Waugh gets a hundred? If (uncapped 22-year-old) Michael Clarke gets 100, I am sure everybody would be happy to see that or somebody else, the former pace bowler added. Hookes, now a television commentator with Thomson, said World Cup-winning skipper Ricky Ponting should be also be handed captaincy of the Test side. I cant see any point Steve Waugh playing Bangladesh. He wont get a hit for starters, Hookes was quoted as saying. Hookes, who has been a constant critic of Waugh, said the 38-year-olds presence in the middle order would give it an ageing look alongside Damien Martyn, 31, and Darren Lehmann, 33. Waugh averaged 75.33 as he led Australia to a 3-1 victory in the Test series in the West Indies last month. The former World Cup-winning skipper, who was overlooked for this years Cup defence, watched on television from Sydney as Ponting led Australia to a 4-3 win in the one-day series against Brian Laras West Indies which ended on Sunday. Waugh has played a world record of 160 Tests and hit 30 Test centuries, behind only Sunil Gavasker (34) and Sachin Tendulkar (31).  (REUTERS)  Copyright

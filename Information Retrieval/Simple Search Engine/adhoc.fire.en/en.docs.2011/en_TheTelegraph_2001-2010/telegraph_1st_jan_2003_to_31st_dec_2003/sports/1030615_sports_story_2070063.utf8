The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Ravi Shastri tackles Cronje issue
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, June 14: Hansie Cronjes ghost loomed at former India captain Ravi Shastris seven-hour interaction with the England-bound South Africa squad yesterday. In an unprecedented move, the South Africans invited Shastri to lecture Graeme Smith and Co. on dealing with the Media  both national and international. The session, of course, took place in Johannesburg. While Shastri declined to go into details  citing a confidentiality agreement  The Telegraph learns that the Cronje issue (which hurt South Africa in the World Cup) figured rather prominently. Apparently, the White-Black controversy also cropped up. After all, there will be occasions when the aggressive English Media is bound to rake that up. The general discussions apart, Shastri had a series of one-to-ones. It was a great experience, he remarked, shortly before leaving JoBurg for Singapore.  Copyright

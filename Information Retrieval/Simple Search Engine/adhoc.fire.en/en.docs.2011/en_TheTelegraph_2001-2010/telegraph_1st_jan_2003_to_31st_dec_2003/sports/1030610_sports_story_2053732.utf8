Second seed Rohit was sharing the lead with top seed Nguyen Ngoc Troung of Vietnam and Toufighi Tamijiani Homayoon of Iran. Aswin Jayaram was half-a-point behind but Indias main hope and third defeat Abhijeet Gupta suffered a shock defeat. Rajasurya was the sole leader in the girls section. Bengals Mary Ann Gomes drew with M. Rajadarshini to move to 1.5 points in the under-14 section, while Saheli Nath beat Sri Lankas Yasoda Gamage to take her tally to two. In the boys under-12 section, P.P. Prachura remained sole leader with three points, followed by Y. Sandeep, K. Narayanan, Yazuvendra Chahal and top seed Le Quang Liem of Vietnam on 2.5 apiece.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Whatmore set to coach Bangladesh 
 FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT Dhaka: Dav Whatmore is set to take over as Bangladesh coach. According to a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) source, the two-year contract will be finalised shortly. The Australian will get $100,000 a year plus other facilities during his stay here. He is expected to reach here early next month to sign on the dotted line. Whatmore, who guided Sri Lanka to the 1996 World Cup triumph, was also in talks with the BCCI to head the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore. It is learnt that the financial factor prompted Whatmore to decide in BCBs favour. Sri Lanka were not interested in retaining Whatmore, despite making the World Cup semi-finals in South Africa. His contract with the Lankan board was to expire in May but he had sought an early release. The BCB is banking on Whatmore to lift their dipping cricket fortunes. Whatmore will be the seventh foreigner to coach Bangladesh after Mudassar Nazar, Mohinder Amarnath, Gordon Greenidge, Eddie Barlow, Trevor Chappell and Mohsin Kamal. Now Sarwar Imran is in charge of the team.  Copyright

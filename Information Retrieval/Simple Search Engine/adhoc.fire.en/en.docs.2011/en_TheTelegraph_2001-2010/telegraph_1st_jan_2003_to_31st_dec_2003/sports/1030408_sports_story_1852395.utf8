 Phelps betters own mark 
 Michael Phelps during the 200m butterfly in Indianapolis Sunday Indianapolis: American teenager Michael Phelps lowered his own world record in the 400m individual medley at the US versus Australia Duel in the Pool meet Sunday. The 17-year-old was ahead of the world record pace he established last August right from the start before touching in 4:10.73. His previous record was 4:11.09. Phelps took a huge lead on the butterfly leg and was never challenged, beating runner-up Tom Wilkens by more than six seconds, with Vendt another second back. Phelps followed up with victory in 100m butterfly at 51.84, an American record and the second-fastest time ever  just 0.03 seconds behind Australian Michael Klims world record. He snatched a third individual victory, overtaking Olympic champion Tom Malchow on the final stroke of the 200m butterfly in 1:55.7. The Australians, without several top names including triple world record holder Ian Thorpe, lost the made-for-television meet 196-74.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

 Clijsters back at world No. 2
Berlin, May 10 (AP): Kim Clijsters climbed to world No. 2 by beating Jennifer Capriati 6-4, 6-7 (2/7), 6-4 Saturday to reach the final of the German Open. The 19-year-old Clijsters passed Venus Williams for the No. 2 after losing the spot to the American following a five- week lay-off, according to WTA officials. Serena Williams, Venus younger sister, is the No. 1. Clijsters, top seed in Berlin, notched her first victory in four career matches against the seventh-ranked Capriati and took a measure of revenge for her loss in the final of the 2001 French Open to the American. In the final, Clijsters will play either compatriot and defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne or 2001 winner Amelie Mauresmo of France.  Copyright

 Habeeb bids Md. Sp. farewell 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Putting all speculation to rest, Mohammed Habeeb has finally severed his coaching ties with Mohammedan Sporting. With that, club officials are now formally on the hunt for a replacement. A host of former India internationals are on their mind, but a senior club official said nothing has been finalised. Confirming Habeebs decision to quit, the official said the club is looking for a better future ahead of the National League, starting next month. Habeeb called us today and said he did not wish to continue as our coach. We have decided to release him and are looking for a new coach, the official said. Habeebs end in the club looked imminent following Mohammedan Sporting failures in the IFA League and IFA Shield. Following Habeebs departure to Hyderabad the club had approached technical adviser P.K. Banerjee. But PK reportedly refused to take additional charge. Club secretary Sultan Ahmed said on Monday that PK has been requested to recommend a prospective candidates for the post and talks with them will begin soon. Meanwhile, IFA Shield winners Mohun Bagan have decided to recruit one or two foreigners. Assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury said the club will scrutinise four players from Brazil in the residential camp later this month and if found okay one or two of them will be taken in.

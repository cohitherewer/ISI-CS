The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Friday, July 25, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 Mohammedan AC made themselves somewhat comfortable in the Calcutta League Super Division Thursday when they beat Wari AC by a solitary goal.				 																																																	Mohammeadn AC needed this win to make sure of their stay in the premier division and they did dominate the proceedings at the Mohun Bagan ground. Though the result was pretty much what the club needed to stay afloat, the domination was certain, as were the misses by Lionel and Bastab Roy in the first session. In the 55th minute Bastab made amends, sending the crucial pass from the left for Najim-ul Haq to shoot home from close. Rains followed, and the rest of the match was statutory.				 																																																	 College Square and Calcutta Sports Association Thursday moved into the semi-finals of the South-West Rotary waterpolo meet, organised by Kidderpore Swimming Club over their course.				 																																																	In their last league matches College Square beat Indian Life Saving Society 11-5, while Calcutta Sports Association (CSA) beat Paddapukur YMA 15-10. Sandip Bose scored five for CSA, while Prahlad Sau scored five for PYMA.

He is still in ICCU, but is expected to be removed to the ward or a room Friday, said the spokesperson.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Star minnows vs Bangla today
			Johannesburg: Before the World Cup began, most experts must have said Saturdays group B encounter between Bangladesh and Kenya here would be a meaningless match. Its anything but that now. Kenyas sensational 53-run win over Sri Lanka in Nairobi on Monday catapulted them to the top of the group table with 12 points from four matches. Following New Zealands boycott of the match in Nairobi, Mondays victory has also left Kenya with a real chance of going through to the Super Six. Collins Obuya was the hero against Sri Lanka, taking five for 21 and is likely to be a big threat again. He has a lion heart, walks like a lion and has the strength of a lion, said captain Steve Tikolo. The boy has come of age, he will definitely go places, said former international fast bowler Edward Odumbe. I will not be surprised if he does continue with his form against Bangladesh.Adding to the encounter is the fact that Bangladesh were chosen ahead of Kenya as the tenth Test-playing nation. The tiny Asian nation has lost 28 of their last 30 one-dayers, the other two games being rain-affected washouts.

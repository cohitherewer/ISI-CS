The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pankaj tops with all-win record
Taupo: National champion Pankaj Advani completed his run through the league phase with a 4-0 victory against Albert Kenny of Ireland and topped his group with an all-win record in the IBSF world under-21 snooker championship on Wednesday. On the conclusion, Pankaj was seeded No.1 for the knock-out stage, ahead of defending champion Ding Junghui of China who is seeded at No.5. Both are in the same half of the draw. Joining Pankaj in the knock-out phase was fellow-Indian Aditya Mehta., who, despite losing his concluding league fixture 1-4 to Mark Allen of Northern Ireland, finished third in the group to qualify for the Round of 32 where matches will be played on a best-of-nine frames basis. Sourav Kothari, the third Indian entry, finished his league campaign on a winning note with a 4-1 result against Germanys Patrick Einsle. However, having lost four of his seven matches, the 18-year old Sourav from Calcutta, ended up fifth in the group and thus failed to qualify for the knock-out phase. Pankaj was one of only two players (the other being Mark Allen) to have won all the league matches.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

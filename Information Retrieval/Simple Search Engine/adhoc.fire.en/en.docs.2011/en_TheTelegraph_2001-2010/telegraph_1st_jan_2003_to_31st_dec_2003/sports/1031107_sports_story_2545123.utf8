The Telegraph - Calcutta
 One-win target for Bangladesh
 - ODI Series - England confident of inflicting 3-0 whitewash  England skipper Michael Vaughan tries out his heading skills on the eve of the first ODI in Chittagong Chittagong: Bangladesh will be happy to win one match out of three when the one-day series against England begins at the M.A. Aziz Stadium here on Friday. I have set the aim of winning at least one match against England, Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore said after his wards were swept aside 2-0 in the recent Test series. Bangladesh have lost 25 of 26 Tests  the other one was a rain-hit draw against Zimbabwe  and their record in one-dayers is equally uninspiring. They have recorded just one victory in 70 matches against Test-playing nations  a controversial defeat of Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup in England. The task against England is made tougher by the absence of strike bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, who was ruled out of the one-dayers after suffering a knee injury in the second Test here last week. England, meanwhile, have been boosted by the return of star allrounder Andrew Flintoff and pace bowler James Anderson, who opted out of the Test series due to injury. England captain Michael Vaughan warned Bangladesh he will settle for nothing less than a 3-0 sweep. We are confident of winning all three matches, he said. But we are not taking things easy and are willing to work hard for it. Joining alongside Flintoff and Anderson are one-day specialists Vikram Solanki, Ian Blackwell, Anthony McGrath, James Kirtley and Andrew Strauss. Opener Marcus Trescothick was also available for selection after recovering from an injury to his left thumb. England have played Bangladesh just once before in one-dayers, securing an eight-wicket win on way to the quarter-finals of the Champions Trophy in Nairobi, Kenya, three years ago. The second and third one-dayers will be played under lights at Dhakas Bangabandhu National stadium on Monday and Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Govt wont hurry 
New Delhi: The Union government on Thursday ruled out early resumption of full cricketing ties with Pakistan, saying restoration of sporting relations would only be possible when the atmosphere is congenial. Though the government has cleared the junior teams to play against Pakistan, sports minister Vikram Verma said ties at the senior level would have to wait till the situation improved further. Verma said former Test cricketer Chetan Chauhan had submitted a proposal to invite veteran Pakistan cricketers to play here with their Indian counterparts, before full ties were restored. We have received the proposal and the matter is under consideration, he said. (PTI)  Copyright

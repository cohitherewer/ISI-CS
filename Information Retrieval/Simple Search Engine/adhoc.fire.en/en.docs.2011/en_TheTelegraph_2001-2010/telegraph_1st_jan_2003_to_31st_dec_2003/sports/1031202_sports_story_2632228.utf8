The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wadekar critical of BCCI stand
Pune: Former India captain and coach Ajit Wadekar thinks the BCCI has acted in haste by suspending Abhijit Kale without giving him a chance to present his version in the bribery scandal. The charges against Kale are very difficult to prove and yet he was suspended. This should not have happened, Wadekar, also a former chairman of the national selection committee, said on Monday. This spoils the career of a good player. Since cricket is a profession, it can badly affect the player and the BCCI should have thought of that before suspending him without inquiry. Kale has been suspended from playing first class cricket after national selectors Kiran More and Pranab Roy accused him offering money to buy a place in the Indian team.  (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PSG boss hopes to keep Ronaldinho Club authorities feel that Ronaldinho is better off playing behind another striker  Paris: Paris St Germain president Francis Graille said he was confident he could keep Ronaldinho in the French capital next season despite media speculation linking the Brazilian World Cup winner with a move away from the club.Nothing is definitely over. Im still confident for the future. I keep in touch with his brother (Ronaldinhos agent) and PSGs representative in Brazil, Graille said Tuesday.I dont think anything will happen before next week, he added.Ronaldinho has been linked with English champions Manchester United and speculation was further fuelled by the presence of manager Alex Ferguson at a horse racing event in Longchamp at the weekend.Ferguson met PSG coach Luis Fernandez at the race track.We of course talked about Ronnie (Ronaldinho) and other players, Fernandez told reporters.He thinks Ronnie is more a number nine-and-a-half than a real number nine, which Ive always said. He said hes a player who needs to play behind another striker, added Fernandez.The Parisian coach added Ferguson would attend the French Cup final between PSG and AJ Auxerre on May 31. Earlier this month the 23-year-old Ronaldinho said he was uncertain about his future, but wanted to play in major competitions and win trophies. PSG, ninth in Frances Ligue 1 with two games left, have lost all hope of playing in the Champions League next season but could secure a Uefa Cup berth if they win the French Cup.

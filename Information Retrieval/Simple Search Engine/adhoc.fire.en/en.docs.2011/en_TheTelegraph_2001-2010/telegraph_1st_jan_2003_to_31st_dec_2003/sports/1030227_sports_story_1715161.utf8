 United, Milan in quarters
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE - Real snatches late equaliser in Dortmund Ruud van Nistelrooy (right) scores Manchester Uniteds third goal against Juventus in Turin Tuesday. United won 3-0. (Reuters) London: Manchester United and AC Milan secured their berths in the Champions League quarter finals with two matches still to play in the second phase on Tuesday with convincing away wins over Juventus and Lokomotiv Moscow.Defending champions Real Madrid left it late to avoid a defeat at Borussia Dortmund that would have dented their hopes of advancing, with a 1-1 draw. United crushed Juventus 3-0 in Turin to become the first club in Champions League history to reach seven successive quarter finals. An appearance in the European Cup final on May 28 looks a real possibility.United completed the double over the Italians following their 2-1 home win last week to maintain their 100 per cent record in group D with 12 points from four matches. Juventus and Deportivo Coruna are second and third on four points. Milan also won their fourth successive match in Group C to ensure their berth in the last eight with a 1-0 win at Lokomotiv Moscow, a repeat of their victory over the Russians in Milan last week.Milan have yet to concede a goal in the second phase so far. But Real needed a stoppage time goal to draw 1-1 at Dortmund in the same group and stay in second place. Milan top the group C table with 12 points, followed by Real (5), Dortmund (4) and Lokomotiv (1).Uniteds win was inspired by Ryan Giggs, an eighth minute substitute for the injured Diego Forlan. Giggs opened the scoring after 15 minutes. He then scored a superb solo after dribbling from the half line in the 41st to set up Uniteds second-ever win in Italy. Ruud van Nistelrooy, made it 3-0 after 63 minutes.Real, who only picked up one point from their opening two group games, moved up from last place to second after beating Dortmund last week in Madrid and looked like heading out of the qualifying positions again, until Jan Koller struck with a fierce angled shot after 22 minutes to give the German side the lead.Real came back two minutes into stoppage time when Portillo struck the equaliser.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Graf, Edberg nominated for induction  Steffi Graf  Newport (Rhode Island): Steffi  Graf, the 22-time Grand Slam singles winner married to top-ranked  Andre Agassi, joined Swedens Stefan Edberg as nominees  for induction to the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Edberg, Graf and American octogenarian Dorothy Cheney will be considered for enshrinement at the Halls 50th anniversary induction ceremonies next July. There are currently 183 members from 18 nations enshrined. A global tennis media panel will vote on the players, with 75 per cent backing needed for enshrinement. Announcement of those selected will be made in January. Germanys Graf won 107 career WTA singles titles, including four Australian Opens, six French Opens, seven Wimbledons and five US Opens. She is the only player to win each of the four major titles four times. In 1988, Graf achieved the Grand Slam by winning all four major titles in a single year. She also won the Olympic gold in the same year. Graf also owned all four Slam titles at once after the 1994 Australian Open. Graf, 34, spent 331 weeks ranked No. 1 in the world and her run of 186 consecutive weeks atop the rankings is a record for any male or female player. She retired in 1999 and is pregnant with her second child with Agassi. Edberg, 37, won 41 career singles titles, including six Grand Slam crowns. He won the 1985 and 1987 Australian Opens, the 1988 and 1990 Wimbledon titles and the 1991 and 1992 US Opens.  He and Anders Jarryd also combined for two Slam doubles  titles.  Kelli White vows to fight  Brussels: Even though Kelli White escaped  a suspension on Wednesday which would have kept her out  of the Athens Olympics, the US sprinter vowed to use all  means possible to hold on to her two world championship  gold medals. White announced she will run the 100m at the Van Damme Memorial on Friday, hours after the IAAF said she tested positive for a minor stimulant which did not merit a two-year suspension but could still cost her the two championship titles. White insisted she deserved no punishment whatsoever for using medicine against a sleeping disorder which was not specifically mentioned on the anti-doping list.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

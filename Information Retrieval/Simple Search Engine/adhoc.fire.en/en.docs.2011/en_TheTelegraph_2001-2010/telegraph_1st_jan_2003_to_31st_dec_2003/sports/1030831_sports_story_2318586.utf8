 I nearly quit, admits Becks
London, Aug. 30 (AFP): David Beckham came close to packing in football as his life changed rapidly and things started to sour at Manchester United. I actually did discuss retiring with Victoria, Beckham told the Sun. There were all sorts of things going on in my life at this time  Romeo had just been born, my parents were divorcing, there was the relationship with the manager and the kidnap threats. I wasnt happy going into work and I think that contributed to me thinking that way.  Copyright

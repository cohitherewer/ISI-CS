 Latif says sorry to PCB 
New Delhi: Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has apologised to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for writing a letter to the International Cricket Council (ICC) raising the issue of fancy fixing, but that might not be enough for him to escape disciplinary proceedings. The PCB said Sunday it was awaiting a response from ICC to know whether any procedure had been violated by Latifs action, and accordingly it would decide whether any action needed to be initiated against him. We have asked ICC to explain if any procedures were violated. If ICC says yes, then the matter would be referred to the PCB disciplinary committee which comprises two judges, one legal advisor and a former Test cricketer, PCB spokesman Samiul Hasan said. Hasan said Latif, in the meanwhile, had already apologised for his action. He has written to the PCB saying he committed a mistake by writing that letter without consulting the board. He regretted his decision and said he would not do any such thing in the future without prior clearance from the board, he said. Asked whether the apology would be the end of the issue, Hasan said it was something for the disciplinary committee to decide, if at all the matter needed to be referred to it. Latif, the original whistle blower on the match-fixing scandal, raised a storm by asking the ICC to do away with the 15-over fielding restrictions in one-dayers, saying it encouraged betting and fancy fixing. Hasan said Latifs letter had put the PCB in a very awkward position. (PTI)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bopanna to miss tie versus NZ
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Injured Bopanna will be out for 8 weeks Calcutta: A stress fracture on the shoulder has sidelined Rohan Bopanna for at least eight weeks. The countrys top-ranked player will thus miss the Davis Cup tie versus New Zealand. The Asia-Oceania zone group I first round tie, which will mark Leander Paes captaincy debut, is to be held in Invercargil, near Christchurch, from February 6-8, 2004. I got a mild stress fracture while I was playing two weeks ago and the doctor has advised rest for eight weeks, Bopanna told The Telegraph.  The 23-year-old from Coorg, who is under Dr Anant Joshis treatment, didnt think it would be so serious when he sustained the injury. Its my first major injury, so obviously Im disappointed it has come at a time when I was looking to consolidate on the gains I made last year. But, then, I have no choice but to accept it and bide my time, said Bopanna who came close to shocking French Open finalist Martin Verkerk in the World Group play-off tie against the Dutch in September. Bopanna is off tennis totally, right now. I hope to pick up a racket around January 20, see how it feels and take it from there. Bopannas injury will be a big blow for Paes Kiwi plans. Having himself played key roles in Indias last two wins over New Zealand  in Wellington in 2002 and Calcutta earlier this year  Paes would have relied on him heavily for this campaign. More so as he himself is yet to return to the competitive scene after his brain lesion scare in August.  Copyright

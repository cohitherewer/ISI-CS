 Akrams nod for one-match comeback
Karachi: Pakistans former captain Wasim Akram has agreed to come out of retirement for a final appearance this year in the home series against South Africa. The 36-year-old, who announced his retirement from international cricket last month, told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that he would be happy to make one final appearance for Pakistan later this year. We want Wasim to play one match this season so that we can give him a fitting farewell for his outstanding contribution to Pakistan cricket, a PCB official said Tuesday. He has conveyed to us he would be happy to play in one match which is yet to be decided, but would probably be against South Africa, general manager cricket operations Zakir Khan said.

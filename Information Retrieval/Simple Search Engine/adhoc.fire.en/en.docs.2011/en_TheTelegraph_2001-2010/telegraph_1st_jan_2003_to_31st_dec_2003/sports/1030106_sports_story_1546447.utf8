		 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 Liverpool in fourth round 
																								Manchester: A second half penalty from England midfielder Danny Murphy booked Liverpool into the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday after a scrappy 1-0 victory over Manchester City.																								Murphy converted his 47th minute spot-kick after Citys Cameroon medio Marc-Vivien Foe used his hand to block Vladimir Smicers cross into the area.																								Citys Nicolas Anelka tried mainly in vain to beat Liverpools offside trap. City stepped up the pace after Murphys strike but Kevin Keegans side never really troubled a well-organised Liverpool defence. (REUTERS)

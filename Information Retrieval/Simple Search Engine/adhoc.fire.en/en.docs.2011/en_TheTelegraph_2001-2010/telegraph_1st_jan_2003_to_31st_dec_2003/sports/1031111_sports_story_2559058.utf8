The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Deep in frame for one keeping berth
 - TEST SQUAD FOR AUSTRALIA - Ability to perform double role should influence  selectors  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Bangalore: Twenty-one months  after his last India appearance, in Georgetown, Deep Dasgupta  stands a good chance of making the Test XVI for the forthcoming  tour of Australia. According to well-placed sources, he  should make the cut when the selectors deliberate here  on Thursday. As of now, its definite that  the squad will have two wicketkeepers and, given that Parthiv  Patel hasnt been doing well, Deep has a good chance of  occupying a berth, is how one of The Telegraphs sources  put it. Parthiv, of course, isnt out of the frame totally. Indeed, he could be the other keeper despite an awful performance in the last Test (Mohali) and a patchy display in the initial matches of the current tri-series. He was even dropped in Cuttack, the other day. Also in the picture, by the way, is local lad Thilak Naidu. The sources, though, confirmed there is general disillusionment with the quality of wicketkeepers. In any case, going by the trend worldwide, a team needs somebody to be counted upon for some runs too. Deeps advantage is that he fits in as opener No. 3 as well  after Virender Sehwag and Akash Chopra. Apparently, Deeps failure in Jaipur (Bengal versus Rajasthan) isnt going to mar his chances as nobody doubts his ability to stand firm at one end. Except his debut (Bloemfontein), Deep opened and wore the big gloves in the next seven Tests. However, though sources feel Deep should make it, Pranab Roy (Easts selector) will have to work overtime. Moreover, captain Sourav Ganguly must pitch very strongly. In the past, the captain has consistently rooted for Deep. So... If Deep is picked, thereby eliminating the need for a specialist third opener, the selectors can choose an extra quick. Otherwise, the squad for the four-Test series will have place for just four new ball bowlers. That (additional) berth may go to Lakshmipathy Balaji or Irfan Pathan, who was brilliant in the U-19 Asia Cup. Its not confirmed, but the XVI could comprise seven batsmen, two keepers (one being Deep), two spinners and five quicks. Meanwhile, as reported in these columns, senior pro Jawagal Srinath is unlikely to offer himself for selection. Therefore, he isnt figuring in anybodys calculations. Srinath has been laid low by a troublesome right knee and the World Cup final remains his last India appearance.  For the record, however, Srinath  who turned up during  the team nets on Monday afternoon  declined to say anything  beyond please wait for a few days...  Copyright

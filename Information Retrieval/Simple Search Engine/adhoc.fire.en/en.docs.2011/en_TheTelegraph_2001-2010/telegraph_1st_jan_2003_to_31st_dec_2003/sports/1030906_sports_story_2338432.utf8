Picture  by Pabitra Das Calcutta: Former India captain, coach and chief selector Ajit Wadekar on Friday said the four Ds  devotion, determination, dedication, discipline  were the key to any individual aiming for the top in any discipline. And chess was no exception, he stressed. Wadekar, the chief guest, was speaking at the awards ceremony of the XVI The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Vidyamandir Hall. Amid a simple yet glittering ceremony, he addressed the children, saying he had thought of taking to chess once when he was young, but I gave it up as a lost case and concentrated on cricket from college, and got to where I did, he said. He said one had to be extremely serious with ones ambitions to get to the top. He gave away the prizes to the very little kids who were the special winners, and to champion Rahul Sangma of Chhapra, Bihar, and to St James School, winners of the Best School award for third straight time. The schools players were accompanied by their principal Terence Ireland. Don Bosco Park Circus finished second and La Martiniere third. Also, the newly-instituted Parimal Mukherjee Memorial prize, for the Best Game, went to Monica Nishad of Bardsley English Secondary School of Madhya Pradesh. This was her game versus Dishari Chakraborty of South Point. The award was given away by the widow of the late Parimal Mukherjee, Anindita Mukherjee. The awardees were selected by GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly and IM Neelotpal Das, who are both products of this meet. Ganguly, in fact, had a long chat with Wadekar. It was, finally, heartening to see little kids at the feet of the once great cricketer.  Copyright

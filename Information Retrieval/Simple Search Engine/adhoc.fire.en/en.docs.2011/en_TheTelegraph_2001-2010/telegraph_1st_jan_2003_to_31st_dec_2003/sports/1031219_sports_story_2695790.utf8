 Hewitt to give Olympics a miss 
 Winning a Slam and defending the Davis Cup are Hewitts priorities next year Melbourne: Lleyton Hewitt will miss next years Athens Olympics because of a clash with the US Open, the former world number one said on Thursday. The Olympic tennis tournament from August 15-22 ends a week before the US Open starts on August 30. The big thing is when we had the Sydney Olympics in 2000, it was after all the four majors had been played, Australian Hewitt told Melbournes Herald Sun newspaper. Athens is being held right before the US Open and its got the same feeling as the Atlanta Olympics (in 1996) when a lot of guys were missing because it was just so close before the US Open. Ive sat down with (coach) Roger (Rasheed) and weve come up with a schedule designed for me to do well at the Grand Slams and Davis Cup. Theyre my priorities next year. I would like to win at least one major and help Australia successfully defend the Davis Cup. Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) media director Mike Tancred released a statement on Thursday confirming Hewitts withdrawal. The Australian Olympic Committee is disappointed because Lleyton is such a great competitor for his country, Tancred said. We admire the spirit and tenacity he displays when he wears the green and gold, especially in the Davis Cup for Australia. We respect his decision and hope that he might re-consider but the AOC cant compel athletes to compete at the Olympics, it is entirely their choice. Former US Open and Wimbledon winner Hewitt, 22, said for many track and field competitors the Olympics were the ultimate prize. But he added: For a tennis player, you can pack up your bags after losing at the Olympics and be on cloud nine two weeks later if youve had a win in New York. Hewitt said his decision had nothing to do with his Belgian girlfriend Kim Clijsterss plan to miss the Games, the newspaper reported. (Reuters)  Copyright

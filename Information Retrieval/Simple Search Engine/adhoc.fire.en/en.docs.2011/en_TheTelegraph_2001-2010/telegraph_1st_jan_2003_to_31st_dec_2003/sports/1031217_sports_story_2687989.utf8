The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Key to success is intense concentration for a series of short periods: Laxman
 - Rahul and I go back a long way and, most important, back each other... He is a terrific bat and an outstanding example  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Laxman has an excellent support system at home Adelaide: With two centuries in four Tests, not to speak of the fifties, V.V.S.Laxman is having an excellent 2003-2004 season. Indeed, he has scored in the sports shorter version as well and, today, is regarded as being among the most artistic on the circuit. Dependable too. Laxman spoke to The Telegraph the other day and, if theres a regret, its that his favourite tennis players  Boris Becker, Steffi Graf and Pete Sampras  have all quit! The following are excerpts Q Thus far, youve had a fantastic season... A Ive been positive, something thats helped... Then, I worked hard in the long off season... The conditioning camp in Bangalore has had its contribution too. (After a pause) In fact, I set out wanting to overcome the big disappointment of last season  not being picked for the World Cup. Frankly, how optimistic were you of making a one-day return? To a large extent... Indeed, at no time did I not back myself to make a comeback. But, yes, I did realise I would first have to be consistent in the Tests and, thereby, remain in the selectors eyes. Was it easy accepting being omitted from the World Cup squad? It hurt... More so as I believed I had it in me to deliver... Initially, it was very frustrating but, then, I didnt lose focus... I was confident God would give another opportunity... I didnt brood and began looking to this season, which is so high on profile. Have different labels in different phases of your career hurt? Dont think about them... Im satisfied as long as I give that hundred per cent... Also, I recognise everybody has a right to an opinion... People are free to say what they like, its my job to continue doing what I know best. In the off season, were you conscious about rotating the strike better in the ODIs? I worked on a lot of things. I mean, nobody is perfect, so everybody needs to work on some aspect. I watched a lot of my footage from last year and spent time analysing my game. A back injury in the West Indies (as the A captain) made you miss the tri-series immediately after the World Cup. Was that a big worry? Well, no... The rehab was effective and I havent missed anything this season. Actually, youve made quite a few comebacks. Is staying focussed a simple affair when you arent in the thick of action? Let me answer it this way: Im never short on motivation and earning another India cap is something which drives me... Then, I keep backing myself. But, do you have a guruji or somebody who can make the difficult times less taxing on the mind? (Grins) No... What I do have is an excellent support system at home... My parents remain a source of strength. What were your thoughts on the eve of the Motera Test, the first of this season? I was pretty upbeat as I had a good Irani game (for Rest of India) ... Eventually, I contributed in both innings. The recent tri-series at home saw you come out with guns blazing. Were you intending to prove a point? Not to anybody else, but I wanted to again prove to myself that I had it in me to make an impression in the ODIs... For me, it was an important series... In any case, being a stroke -maker, Ill be scoring at a nice clip... How do you look back on seven years at the highest level? Its been up-and-down... But, yes, theres a distinct difference ever since Ive batted in the middle-order only.. Im improving with each series and, because I havent been opening, the past three years have seen me grow as a batsman. Why did you open? When I did, I saw it as a challenge... Only, it didnt work out. Did you, on landing in Australia, find yourself under more pressure because of that epic (281) in Calcutta? No, for the simple reason that irrespective of your last score or whatever, a new match or innings is a new innings or match. Personally, though, I dont get weighed down by expectations. In fact, its nice that people expect big scores... Of course, its important to play the ball on merit. Is the adjustment in Australia wholly in the mind, or... Most of it. Can you do better than the 281? (Grins again) Im striving... Having said that, the situation must be such that I can again go for a long innings... Really, quite a few things will first have to fall in place. Ive got to triple hundreds for Hyderabad, though. The understanding between you and Rahul Dravid is... (Interrupting) We go back a long way and, most important, back each other. If I may add, Rahul is a terrific bat and an outstanding example. Today, how many marks would you give yourself on ten? Difficult to answer... Its difficult... But, yes, I aim for that perfect score. Does switching on and off come naturally? Ive got to manage... While batting, one can switch off during the break between overs ... The key to success, probably, is intense concentration for a series of short periods. It is true you even set daily goals? Yes, it could be related to what I want to achieve at nets... Once you start achieving small goals, getting to the bigger ones becomes easy. Till you made it to Team India, who did you look up to? Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev... Then, on account of being in Hyderabad, Mohammed Azharuddin... In more recent times, Ive learnt much from Sachin Tendulkar... Whats it like playing Australia? A big challenge... One shouldnt get overawed and, then, no team is unbeatable. Who is the toughest bowler youve faced? Wasim Akram, without a second thought. Being around for seven years, whats the No.1 change in the dressing room? Everybody wants to help each other and that makes for a nice atmosphere... Also, everybody has this desire to improve. Its an attitude which has encouraged individual and collective betterment. The final question: How did you manage such an unhappy show, on the field, in the tri-series final (versus Australia) at the Eden? I agree I had a bad day dropping catches, but its not that I didnt put in hundred per cent. I would have been upset had I been short on commitment.  Copyright

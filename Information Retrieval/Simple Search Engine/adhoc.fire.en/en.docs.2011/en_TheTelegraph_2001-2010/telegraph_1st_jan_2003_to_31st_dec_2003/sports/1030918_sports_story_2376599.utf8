 Hammer charged with murder
		 Yetunde PriceCompton (California): A felon with ties to  a street gang was charged with murder in the death of the  sister of Serena and Venus Williams.  Aaron Michael Hammer appeared briefly Tuesday in superior  court but judge John J Cheroske postponed his arraignment  to September 23 at the request of the defence. He remained  held without bail. Hammer, 24, of Compton, is accused in the shooting of Yetunde Price, 31, as she sat in a sport utility vehicle early Sunday with a companion, Rolland Wormley, 28. An assault rifle and shell casings were found at the scene. Authorities initially reported she was shot in the chest, but a coroners spokesman said Tuesday an autopsy showed she died of a gunshot wound to the head. Hammer also was charged with using and possessing a firearm. If convicted of all charges, Hammer would face life in prison with the possibility of parole. Hammer has ties to a Compton Street gang but is not a member, authorities have said without elaboration. He has convictions for check forgery and commercial burglary. Authorities declined to say whether Hammer was the gunman who fatally shot Price. As many as three other suspects are being sought in the case, deputy Richard Pena said. Activists and residents raised candles in Prices memory Monday night at an anti-violence rally in Compton. Price, a registered nurse who owned a beauty salon, was one of five sisters who spent their early years in Compton, a crime-plagued city southeast of Los Angeles. Price, a mother of three, also served as a personal assistant to her famous half sisters, who moved to Florida with their parents when they turned pro as teenagers. Sheriffs investigators said Price and Wormley got into a dispute with a group of residents in an area known for gangs and drugs. The prosecution did not release any information on a possible motive for the killing. Authorities said they had no indication that Price, who lived about 60 kilometers away in Corona, was involved with drugs or gangs. Wormley drove the wounded Price to his relatives house in neighboring Long Beach and called emergency services. Price was taken to a Long Beach hospital, where she died. Wormleys sister attended Hammers court hearing and afterward disputed investigators account of the shooting. She said the pair were just driving through Compton at the time. Richard Williams, father of Serena and Venus Williams and stepfather of the victim, also attended the hearing. He left without comment.  (AP)  Copyright

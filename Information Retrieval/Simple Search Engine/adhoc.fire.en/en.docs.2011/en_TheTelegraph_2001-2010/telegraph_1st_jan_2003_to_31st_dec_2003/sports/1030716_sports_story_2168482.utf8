The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Wednesday, July 16, 2003  Daniel, Amyn may dictate terms 
 BY STAR RACER				 										Calcutta: It may pay to follow the Daniel David-Amyn Merchant combinations in Wednesdays race-card. The duo is likely to dominate proceedings in most of the six events in the frame, including the 1,100m La Gitana Cup for horses in Class II. Daniel has three horses running for the trophy but his charge Moon Mission has the best credentials. On the opening day of the season, she cut an erratic course and thus was relegated to the second slot after winning the race.The Always A Rainbow-Moccasin four-year-old is expected to mend her shortcomings in the hands of Merchant.				 										In the Zelda Cup, Bharath Singhs Rescue Act, however, has the edge over his six rivals, including Daniels Bay Dragon. The five-year-old by Procida out of Irresistible is not only looking well, he is also well in at the weights. 				 										Daniels Amber Song, Bright And Clear and Land of Fantasy may also lift their respective events. Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:				 										1.

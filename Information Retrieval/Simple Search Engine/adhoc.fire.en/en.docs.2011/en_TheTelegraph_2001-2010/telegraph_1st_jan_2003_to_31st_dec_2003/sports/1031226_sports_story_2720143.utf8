The Telegraph - Calcutta
 United exit still upsets Beckham
 Beckham unhappy over not having heard from Ferguson since his move to Real London: David Beckham has again expressed surprise about the way in which he was forced out of Old Trafford before his highly-publicised move to Spanish giants Real Madrid last summer. The celebrity superstar, 28, joined Real for 25 million pounds on July 2 after United, whom he had joined as a fresh-faced schoolboy, had originally accepted a similar bid from Barcelona. Beckhams four-year contract with the nine-time European champions is worth an estimated six million euros a year before bonuses. But despite the frills of playing with one of the biggest clubs in the world, Beckham admitted in an ITV documentary he was stunned to learn that United had accepted an offer for him in the first place. I didnt think for one moment it would happen. I was more upset than anything because I had put so much into the club. I felt I had given 120 per cent every time I performed, Beckham said in the documentary entitled The Real Beckhams. Beckham also revealed his regret that he and Sir Alex Ferguson have hardly spoken since he left the club. He hasnt spoken to me still, said Beckham. I just expected a bit more respect when I had been at the club for that many years. Beckham admitted that his move to Spain, along with wife Victoria and sons Brooklyn and Romeo, had been stressful. Things have been difficult moving to Spain, he said. Its just been very difficult and it has been very stressful.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England nail Bangla again
Dhaka: Andrew Flintoff cracked a 47-ball 70 not out as England beat Bangladesh by seven wickets to clinch their three-match one-day International series 2-0 on Monday. The 25-year-old allrounder claimed his second successive Man-of-the-Match award as he hammered nine fours and four sixes while sharing an unbroken 100-run stand with captain Michael Vaughan (37 not out). England coasted home with more than 22 overs to spare. Seamer Richard Johnson had earlier picked up three for 22 to restrict Bangladesh, who opted for first strike, to a wretched 134 for nine. At one stage, they were seven for four in the 10th over. England got into early trouble against the seaming ball  losing Vikram Solanki (0), Marcus Trescothick (9) and Paul Collingwood (11) to slump to 37 for three  before Flintoff took charge. He was particularly severe on left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique, who he hit for 17 runs in an over. (Reuters)  Copyright

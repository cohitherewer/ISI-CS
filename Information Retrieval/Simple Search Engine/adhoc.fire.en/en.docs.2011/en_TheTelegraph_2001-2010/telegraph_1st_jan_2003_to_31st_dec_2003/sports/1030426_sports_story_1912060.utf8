The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Steve sure of clean sweep 
 Theres no reason why we cant, says Steve Port-of-Spain: Australian captain Steve Waugh wants his all-conquering side to write another chapter in their golden story by becoming the first visiting team to clinch a Test series clean-sweep in the Caribbean. After pulling off a 118-run win in the second Test here, Waugh says he is confident that his side can win the next two matches in Barbados (May 1-5) and Antigua (May 9-13). We have the best bowler in the world, Glenn McGrath, coming back into our side and we are playing good cricket, so there is no reason why we cannot win the next two Tests, said Waugh. We want to create our own history. We want to win the next two Test matches and continue to improve. We have played excellent cricket in the first two Tests, but we will not be letting up in Barbados and Antigua. But I am sure the West Indies will be looking to come back, they have a pretty good record in barbados over the years, Waugh said. It was an excellent win here for us because to take 20 wickets on this pitch was never going to be easy and, realistically, we gave the West Indies a chance, so I am very happy with the win, said Waugh who now has a record of 35 wins out of 47 Tests as Australia captain. West Indies skipper Brian Lara, who made a fruitless 122 in his sides second innings at the Queens Park Oval here, said he was still confident that his side could level the series. My approach in the remaining matches will be very positive. I am very optimistic about our batting in the remaining matches, in the bowling we need to do some work to limit the Australians, said Lara who now has 20 centuries in 92 Tests.  (AFP)  Copyright

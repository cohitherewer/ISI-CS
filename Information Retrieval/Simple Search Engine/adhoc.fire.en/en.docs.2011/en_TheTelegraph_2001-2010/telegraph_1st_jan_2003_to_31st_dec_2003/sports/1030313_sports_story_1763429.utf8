 Pathan, Ranadeb trigger Plate A collapse
 HIRWANI: Five for 76 Chennai: Baroda speedster Irfan Pathan and Bengal pacer Ranadeb Bose shared six wickets for Elite A to restrict Plate A to 234 for seven on the opening day of the Duleep Trophy match Wednesday. Ranadeb, who had an impressive Ranji Trophy season, triggered the collapse removing opener R. Jaiswal (80) after he and Rowland Barrington put up 147 runs for the first wicket. He also sent back captain Hrishikesh Kanitkar (6) before Pathan came into the act. In a superb spell, he took four wickets as Elite A slumped to 216 for seven. However, the fielding of Plate A, which comprises Bengals Devang Gandhi and Deep Dasgupta, other than Ranadeb, left a lot to be desired. Four catches were dropped, including one of Jaiswal. Meanwhile, in another match, Elite B, led by Rohan Gavaskar, were 343 for eight at stumps against Plate B. Former Indian keeper M.S.K. Prasad (37) and Bengal off spinner Sourashish Lahiri (30) were at the crease. Veteran leg spinner Narendra Hirwani (five for 76) took four wickets in the space of 22 balls. Electing to bat, Elite B began steadily with openers Amit Pagnis (23) and Wasim Jaffer (35) putting on 66 runs. But they soon slumped to 110 for three before Arjun Yadav (59), Rohan (42), and Tejinder Pal Singh (64) fought back. Yadav added 42 with Jaffer for the third wicket before adding another 58 runs with Rohan. Yadav was then involved in a 98-run stand with Singh before Hirwani took charge. He removed Singh, Yadav, Sairaj Bahutule and Amit Uniyal. Earlier, the leggie had claimed the wicket of Vinayak Mane. BRIEF SCORES n Plate A 234/7 (R. Jaiswal 80, R.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Qualifiers claim Hendrawan 
Birmingham: World champion Hendrawan of Indonesia was beaten Tuesday in the qualifying competition of the All England badminton championship. Hendrawans form has dipped since his world title triumph in Seville in 2001 and he found himself obliged to qualify for the All England meet. Hendrawan began his bid for a place in the main draw with a 15-10, 13-15, 15-6 win over Magnus Repsgard of Sweden. But he looked a shadow of his former self in losing 13-15, 15-12, 7-15 to Yohan Wiratama of Hong Kong . I am a little annoyed that I am having to qualify but I understand the ranking system so I accept the decision, Hendrawan said later. The Indonesian has only reached one quarter final since his Seville triumph and Tuesdays defeat represents another big disappointment.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

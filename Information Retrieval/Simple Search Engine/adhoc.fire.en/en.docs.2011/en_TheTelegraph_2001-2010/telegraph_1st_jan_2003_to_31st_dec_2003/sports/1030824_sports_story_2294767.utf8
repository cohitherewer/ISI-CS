The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hewitt and his other love 
New York, Aug. 23 (AFP): Former Wimbledon and US Open champion Lleyton Hewitt revealed that he was considering quitting tennis to play Australian rules football. The 22-year-old Australian told the US Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe during a television interview on Friday that he did not care if abandoning his tennis career cost him millions of dollars a year. Hewitt, whose father Glynn is a former Aussie rules player, and who is a fervent fan of the Adelaide Crows, has not won a tournament in five months and has slipped to sixth in the rankings. The last time Hewitt played the rugged Aussie game was when he attended Adelaide private school Immanuel College, but he impressed with his skills during a charity football match in Adelaide last September. He really surprised me by saying he would love to play Australian rules football and not necessarily love to be a tennis player for the next eight years, said McEnroe.  Copyright

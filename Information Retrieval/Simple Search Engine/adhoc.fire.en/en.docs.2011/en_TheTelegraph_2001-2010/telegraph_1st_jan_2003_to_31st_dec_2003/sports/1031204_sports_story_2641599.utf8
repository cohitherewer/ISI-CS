 Besiktas, Chelsea tie in Germany 
London: Besiktas will play their Champions League game against Chelsea in Germany next week after losing an appeal on Wednesday to have the match played in Turkey. The appeal, against a decision by Uefa to stage the Group G tie in Gelsenkirchen next Tuesday, was thrown out by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne. The CAS has decided to dismiss the application for urgent interim measures filed by the Turkish Football Association and the club Besiktas requesting the annulment of the decision made by Uefa, the court said in a statement. Uefa said last week the Besiktas-Chelsea fixture was one of three games being moved from Turkey to neutral venues after a spate of bomb attacks in Istanbul in which 61 people were killed and more than 700 wounded. Chelsea have already secured their place in the knockout phase of the competition while Besiktas, who beat Claudio Ranieris side at Stamford Bridge in October, require victory to guarantee joining them in the last 16.

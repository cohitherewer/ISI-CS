 Arindam beats Uzbek GM
Jamshedpur: Upsets continued to be the order of the day in the third round of the Tata International Open chess tournament with unheralded Vinod Bhagwat defeating British champion Abhijit Kunte and Arindam Mukherjee knocking off Grandmaster Marat Dzhumaev of Uzbekistan. As many as 14 players including Pentyala Harikrishna, Dibyendu Barua, Alexander Fominyh of Russia, Saidali Iuldashev of Uzbekistan, and the Bangladesh duo of Niaz Murshed and Ziaur Rahman  maintained their clean slate after Round III. Vinod Bhagwat, who drew with top seeded GM Dmitry Svetushkin of Moldova in Round II, had another good result against Abhijit after the latter tried hard to make headway in a dynamically balanced position in the match. Arindam opted for a side variation with white against Marats Leningrad Dutch and troubled him right through the game with an imaginative attack. Marats counterplay bid did materialise in the middle game but Arindam was quite up to the task after the Uzbek erred decisively. Dibyendu Barua romped home against Valay Parikh. (PTI)  Copyright

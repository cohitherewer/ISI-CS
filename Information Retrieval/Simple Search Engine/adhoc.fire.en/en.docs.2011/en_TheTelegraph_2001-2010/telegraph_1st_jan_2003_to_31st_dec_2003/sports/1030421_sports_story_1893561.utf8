The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Two more banned
 Milkha wants exemplary punishment for doping offenders New Delhi: While Indias premier athletic body Saturday banned sprinter Jagdish Basak and hurdler Kalyani Alapati for two years after they tested positive for doping in the National Games held in December, the association Sunday also suspended womens 100m sprint champion Kavita Pandya and hurdler Udaya Laxmi until further notice for taking an anabolic steroid. The last two had been identified among the eight by the AAFI, but had been waiting the verdict. Basak, winner of the mens 100 m, and Alapati, who took bronze in the womens 400 m hurdles, both tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone. Of the eight identified, four other  Ramandeep Singh, Maha Singh, Hridayanand Singh and Sukhjinder Singh  were warned and disqualified from the competition after they were caught using stimulants and also face suspension. In a hard-hitting interview to a newspaper, Laxmi, one of the 22 athletes to have tested positive at the Hyderabad National Games last year, said she and many of her colleagues were forced by the Andhra Pradesh officials to take drugs so that Andhra Pradesh could come on top. In Chandigarh legendary athlete Milkha Singh has called for exemplary punishment for the guilty so that it could act as a deterrent for all other sportspersons in the country. These days the youth want to do everything in just a year through intake of drugs, Milkha Singh, who is also the chief of Punjab Amateur Athletic Federation said here. Banning such players from participating further in events will send a signal for the future sportspersons to refrain from indulging in use of banned substances, the Flying Sikh said. Welcoming the decision of the AAFI to act against at least six athletes, including four from Punjab, Milkha said the use of drugs by sportspersons is spreading like a cancer.

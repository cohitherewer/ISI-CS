The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 We were done in by referee: Port coach
 BY A STAFF REPORTER 																								Calcutta, Jan. 11: Port Trust coach Biswajit Bhattacharjee said his team was hard done by the referee against Vasco SC in the IFA Shield match on Saturday. 																								Every body saw what had happened to Bijay (Paul). It was in no way a bookable offence, Biswajit said after the match. We were leading at that time, but that one decision demoralised us completely, he added. 																								He, however, admitted that his team should have pulled it off despite the absence of a key man. We missed so many sitters that I could not even curse my luck, he remarked. 																								Striker Amar Pyne also viewed Bijays departure as the turning point of the match. We found it difficult to recover from the shock for a moment and conceded three quick goals, felt the Port Trust scorer. 																								Vasco coach Derrick Pereira, however, maintained he was always confident of beating their Port Trust.																								True, we allowed them to enjoy space, but we had a gameplan and it clicked, he said. He, however, said his defence required more attention from him. They had a bad outing today. But Im hopeful things will improve.

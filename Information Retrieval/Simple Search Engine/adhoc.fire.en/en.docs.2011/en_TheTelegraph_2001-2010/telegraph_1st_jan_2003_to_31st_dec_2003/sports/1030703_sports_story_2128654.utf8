The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Javed, John may rule Day I 
 BY STAR RACER Javed Calcutta: The experienced lot, over the monsoon course, are going to be the key players on Thursday, the opening day of the season. Youngsters, unless very fit, take over once they adapt themselves to the wet conditions and the tricky monsoon race-track. The track, nevertheless, appears to be in good condition, thanks to the heavy showers. However, the rains have nothing to do with small fields in the opening days card. With the horse-strength touching the 300-mark by the middle of the month, racing will definitely become competitive. Significantly, prominent riders like C. Alford and A. Merchant would be missed during the first-half of the season as the former is under suspension and the latter nursing a chest injury sustained from a kick during trials on Wednesday morning. It may pay to follow trainers Javed Khan and John Stephens early in the season before Daniel David and the Singh brothers  Vijay and Bharath  take over. Between them, the three schoolers share nearly two-thirds of the total horse-strength available in the Hastings stables.In fact, Javed and John may kick off with a double apiece on the day. Javeds Never Mind and Venus, and Johns Software and Software Classic have been showing good form during their trials. However, Vijays Alsh-eim,too, is working well and may win the Turf Hawk Cup.Read as Horse nos, last four runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 McGrath leaves for West Indies 
Sydney: Australian pacer Glenn McGrath left for the West Indies Monday to rejoin his teammates after his cancer-stricken wife declared she wanted some normality back in her life. McGrath returned from Australias Caribbean tour after his wife Jane was diagnosed with secondary cancer in her hip earlier this month. The diagnosis relates to the breast cancer she fought in 1997, when she endured six months of chemotherapy before being cleared of cancer in June 1998. It was not originally known when or if McGrath would rejoin the team in the West Indies, with Australia taking a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series. But McGraths decision to rejoin the team came after a specialist said his wifes condition was not as bad as first feared. She started treatment last week and thats gone very well, McGrath said before his departure.And Jane just wants a bit of normality back in her life and for her, thats me playing cricket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kale will have to show cause
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The disciplinary committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Thursday decided to showcause Maharashtra cricketer Abhijit Kale, who had allegedly attempted to bribe two national selectors for a Team India berth. The three-member committee went through inquiry commissioner D. V. Subba Raos report and deliberated for long on the issue before arriving at the decision to give the tainted cricketer an opportunity to explain his conduct, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya told reporters later. The BCCI disciplinary committee has found a prima facie case and framed the charges against Abhijit Kale. Accordingly, the committee has decided to send a showcause notice to the cricketer, Dalmiya, who is also the chairman of the committee, said. Kamal Morarka and Ranbir Singh Mahendra, both BCCI vice-presidents, are the other members of the disciplinary committee. Dalmiya said the showcause notice will be sent to Kale soon. He was, though, noncommittal about any timeframe on the final verdict on the Kale issue. The disciplinary committee has the final say on this issue. However, according to a member of the BCCIs legal cell, the cricketer will be asked to reply within 15 days.  Copyright

																								Melbourne: James Blake said it was ridiculous to expect him and US Davis Cup teammate Andy Roddick to fill Pete Sampras and Andre Agassis shoes.																								Were following Sampras and Agassi, I really think those are enormous shoes to fill, the American said. What do they have, 21 Grand Slams between them? 																								That generation of players is, if not the best, one of the best generations ever. I think its crazy to say that there will ever be another generation like that. Its ridiculous, added Blake, one of the so-called Generation Next of American tennis that includes Roddick, Taylor Dent and Mardy Fish.																								Talking of his four-set defeat to Rainer Schuettler of Germany Monday in the Australian Open, Blake said: This (defeat) hurts quite a bit but the more it hurts, I guess, that means the better Im doing.																								Blake, who created a stir among female fans in Melbourne with his new sleeveless shirt, teamed up with Serena Williams to help the US win their second Hopman Cup in Perth at the start of the year.

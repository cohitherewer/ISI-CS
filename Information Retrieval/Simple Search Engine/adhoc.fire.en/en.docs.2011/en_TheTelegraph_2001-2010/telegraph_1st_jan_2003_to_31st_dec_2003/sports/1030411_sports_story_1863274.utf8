 Churchill edge out Tollygunge
Margao: Yusif Yakubus second-half strike guided Churchill Brothers to a 1-0 win over Tollygunge Agragami and lifted the Goan team to sixth place in the Oil PSU National Football League at Nehru Stadium Thursday. After a barren first half, Churchill Brothers, who found stiff resistance from the rival defence and goalkeeper Arindam Ghosh, scored the all important goal in 69th minute through Yakubu. The Ghanaian striker chested down a long lob from Noel Wilson and went past two defenders before slotting the ball to the far side of the net. With this win, Churchill Brothers took their tally to 28 points from 19 matches. Tollygunge Agragami remain in ninth place with 22 points, also after 19 outings. Both teams played aggressively and Churchill Brothers, who had more of ball possession and better exchanges, created more scoring chances in the first half. They could have scored in the 14th minute but some timely saves by keeper Arindam thwarted Yakubu from scoring. Tollygunge Agragami made a counter move and Moses Owira nearly succeeded in finding the net when his back-heel was saved on the goalline by defender Rajesh Meetei. Tollygunge defender Isiaka Awoyemi had a good game.  (PTI)  Copyright

		 Tuesday, January 21, 2003 				 Crowe sorry for Maori comments
				 	 Crowe: Didnt mean to hurt sentiments																								Wellington: Former New Zealand cricket captain Martin Crowe has apologised for saying that Maori did not make good cricketers because they lacked patience for the duration of a match, it was reported on Monday.																								Crowe said on television he wanted to sincerely apologise to anyone he may have offended by the comments, made in his column for the widely read Wisden website for cricket, NZPA news agency said.																								He said the remark was made in the context of praise for star Maori Black Cap Daryl Tuffey and a lament that there were not more like him.																								The intention was to be positive about a young Maori bowler who I think has made a significant breakthrough, said Crowe, whose brother Jeff is the Blacks Caps manager.																								Crowe had said in his column: Tuffey is a Maori and, traditionally, not many Maori make good cricketers because they dont have the patience or the temperament to play through a whole day, leave alone over a Test match.																								The remarks caused outrage in both Maori and sports circles, with New Zealand cricket operations manager and former Test player John Reid saying a number of promising young Maori were heading towards contention for the national team.																								But Auckland sports commentator Murray Deaker said he believed Crowe had nothing to apologise for. Deaker, in his radio show, said Crowe was simply stating a fact that there were few Maori yet at the top of the game.  (AFP)

 Pritam stuns Surya
 -Jamshedpur meet - Difficult day for seeded players  Bad day in office for Surya Jamshedpur: Pritam Singh of Jharkhand created a major stir, upsetting GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly in the second round of the Tata International Open chess tournament on Tuesday. It turned out to be a difficult day for many seeded players as some lost and some others drew against less fancied opponents. The unheralded Vinod Bhagwat played brilliantly to hold top seed GM Dmitry Svetushkin of Moldova. Later, Laltu Chatterjee held British Open champion GM Abhijit Kunte. Second seed P. Harikrishna, however, won against J. Sureshkumar. The hero of the second round, undoubtedly, was Pritam who bounced back from a seemingly hopeless position to record the biggest victory of his career. Not a regular player these days, Pritam was clearly not well versed with the main variation of the English Opening which he opted for against Ganguly who played black. After the initial exchanges, Pritam reached an inferior endgame. However, Ganguly erred, and eventually lost a handful of pawns to finally resign when Pritam threatened to queen his passed pawn on the kingside. There was more good news for local talents as Abhishek Das, runner-up in last national under-18 championship, outwit former Asian junior bronze medallist K. Ratnakaran in a brilliant attacking game with white pieces. Amongst the GMs, Commonwealth champion Dibyendu Barua had a tough time and in his own words was very lucky to beat Hariom Sharma. Bangladeshs Niaz Murshed solved his opening problems pretty easily to crush Debashish Chakraborty. Uzbek Marat Dzhumaev faced little problem in beating Vipul Subhashi.  (PTI)  Copyright

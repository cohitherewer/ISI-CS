The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tougher climb now: Bhowmick
 - Bagan coach excited at play-off prospect  BY A STAFF REPORTER  Subhas Bhowmick cant believe his luck after East Bengal drew with Ever-Ready on Wednesday. Picture by Amit Datta Calcutta: East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick had his emotions in check by the time he got down to meeting the media following his teams 2-2 draw versus Ever-Ready in their crucial Super Division Championship Leg match at home. It wasnt just the draw, but the fact that it will be a tough line to tow now for East Bengal, that worries Bhowmick. He attributed this poor show to a combination of a coincidence of all that is bad  that ten per cent chance that we falter  a dose of complacency and two rather silly mistakes by players who he said wouldnt do it in more than once in a hundred attempts. This was one of those days, was how the coach wanted to sum up his teams performance. And he said theyll have to fight now. But it isnt as if I havent seen anything like it before, he said, wearing a weary smile, too. Last year we were ahead nine points and then we were down, but we still won. So it isnt as if this is the end of the road for us, it is just a tougher climb, much more work on our part. I believe, given a hundred chances, M. Suresh wouldnt make such a hash of a clearance (ball taking shin bone and rolling out for the equaliser). This had to be his day. And Debjit isnt ever to slow in reacting, and then we messed up our shooting. I will have to study this situation, and then decide on an approach route. I believe the loss to Mohammedan Sporting, more than the draw with Mohun Bagan, proved to be our dip point start. That was from where the pressure got us, and is still haunting us. Bhowmick said he will have to see what has got into Mike Okoro that isnt allowing the player to keep to form. Asit Ghosh, the acting Ever-Ready coach said he had a plan of holding the East Bengal attackers in a box and that this clicked today. We have now taken points off all top teams. That is our satisfaction.  Aloke looks ahead Meanwhile, Aloke Mukherjee, the Mohun Bagan coach, is excitedly looking into the play-off scenario that has become so real after East Bengals draw with Ever-Ready Wednesday. Thursday, versus Tollygunge Agragami, he will try a free-Jose Ramirez Barreto effect. This is a situation where he intends to field Marcos Parreira as the striker, and leave Barreto to decide where and when he wishes to be. What Mukherjee is aiming at is an early goal in the match, finish off any hope that Tollygunge may have of shooting a surprise. That means the team could be geared up to a semi-defensive orientation thereafter. Mukherjee will be missing Rishi Kapoor (fever) and Babun Kar (injury) Thursday. Tollygunge will be missing their key man, Akeem Abolanle through double booking and Sujit Neogi and Sandip Das through injury. That will give Mukherjee that extra advantage to push his team towards the title that was, till recently, way beyond reach.  Copyright

 Mutola alone in jackpot hunt
Berlin: Maria Mutola remained the only athlete in contention for the Golden Leagues $1 million jackpot with a commanding win in the 800m in Berlin on Sunday. The Olympic and world champion, undefeated this year over two laps, had earlier seen Bahamian Chandra Sturrup drop out of the running for a share of the prize for athletes with victories in all six events in the showcase series. Sturrup was beaten into third place in the womens 100m by American Kelli White, who confirmed her status as a favourite for the title at the world championships in Paris which begin on August 23.

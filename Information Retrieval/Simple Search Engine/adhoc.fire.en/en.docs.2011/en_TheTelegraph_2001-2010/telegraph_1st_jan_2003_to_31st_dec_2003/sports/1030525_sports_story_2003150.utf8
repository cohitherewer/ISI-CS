The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pranab a quick learner
 BY OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Calcutta, May 24: The lead-up to todays selection committee meeting found Easts Pranab Roy being given the Shiv Sundar Das or Rohan Gavaskar option by his colleagues. However, while Pranab is new to the job  he succeeded Ashok Malhotra last September  he is learning the ropes rather quickly. Indeed, according to The Telegraphs sources, he repeatedly insisted both would have to be picked and that the either/or scenario was of no relevance. For good measure, Pranab also made it a point to have a quiet word with the Board president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, when he interacted with the selectors before they actually sat down to choose the XVI. If that was meant to convey a signal, Pranabs colleagues obviously did take note. In fact, picking Team India probably seems a much easier task than selecting the A outfit.  Copyright

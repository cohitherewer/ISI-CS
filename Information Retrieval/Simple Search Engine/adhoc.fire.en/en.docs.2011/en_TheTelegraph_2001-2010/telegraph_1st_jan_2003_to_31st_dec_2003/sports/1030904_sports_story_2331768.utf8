 Delhi HC dismisses second PIL 
New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday dismissed as withdrawn a Public Interest Litigation challenging the Centres decision to waive import duty worth Rs 1.13 crore on a Ferrari car gifted to cricketer Sachin Tendulkar. The move came as another PIL on the same matter was pending in the court. The PIL by advocate T.K.A. Padmanabhan was dismissed as withdrawn by a division bench of Chief Justice B.C. Patel and Justice A.K. Sikri. However, the court allowed the petitioner to implead himself in the earlier PIL.  (PTI)  Copyright

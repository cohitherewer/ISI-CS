The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Eriksson for anthem respect
Leicester: England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson urged home fans to respect the anthem of Serbia and Montenegro before Tuesdays friendly, following the boos and whistles against Turkey in April. Echoing a call on Monday by absent skipper David Beckham, Eriksson made the appeal in his first programme notes since the Euro 2004 qualifying win over Turkey in Sunderland was marred by racist abuse and crowd trouble.

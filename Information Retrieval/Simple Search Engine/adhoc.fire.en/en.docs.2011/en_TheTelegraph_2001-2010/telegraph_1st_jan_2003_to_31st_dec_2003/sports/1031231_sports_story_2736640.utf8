The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak take 24 balls to lift series
 - Second test - Fleming puts it down to lack of killer instinct
 Pakistan team, after clinching the series in Wellington on Tuesday. (AP) Wellington: Pakistan needed only 16 minutes and 24 balls on Tuesday to complete a seven-wicket win over New Zealand in the second and final Test, giving the visitors a 1-0 victory in the series. Captain Inzamam-ul Haq (72 not out) and Yusuf Youhana (88 not out) continued where they left off on Day 4 and quickly scored the 28 runs needed for a stunning win. Rain twice delayed the start of play on the final day, but couldnt save New Zealand from an embarrassing match and series defeat  their first loss in 10 Tests. Pakistans winning total was the best at the Basin Reserve. New Zealand had seemed in a strong position when they took a 170-run first-innings lead after dismissing Pakistan for 196. The hosts were still in charge of the match when they led by 245 with seven second-innings wickets in hands at the start of the fourth day. But the one and only Shoaib Akhtar destroyed New Zealands batting with an impeccable spell of reverse-swing on Monday, bundling them out for 103 and leaving his team a 274-run target. The win was a formality after Pakistan reached 246 for three by the end of the fourth day with their most experienced batsmen, Inzamam and Youhana, on top of the New Zealand attack.  An apparent misunderstanding of the rules prevented Pakistan from calling for an extra half hour or eight overs at the end of play Monday which would have allowed them to end the match inside four days. Heavy overnight rain and light showers this morning delayed the start of play by 30 minutes. A second delay lasted 20 minutes, as Inzamam and Youhana returned in cool conditions and under the threat of further rain to quickly wrap up victory. Akhtar was Man of the Match for turning the game on its head with his six for 30 in the second innings. His match-haul read an outstanding 11 for 78, the second-best by a Pakistan bowler against New Zealand. Stephen Fleming attributed the defeat to a lack of a killer instinct. I dont think it was application or commitment that was missing. We got tentative as we lost two or three wickets because we could see what was happening, Fleming said of his sides dramatic second-innings collapse when they lost seven wickets for eight runs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 De Villiers advocates specialist coach for Nehra, Zaheer
 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI Combining pace with movement: Jawagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra Durban: Had Fanie de Villiers TV commitments not come in the way, its possible he would have been Indias bowling coach in the ongoing World Cup. As it turns out, though, the Indians have done exceptionally without specialised help.Yeah, theyve been doing very well... For the first time, John Wright has a product on his hands. The biggest difference, of course, is that Jawagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra are combining pace with movement. Its a terrific combination, Fanie told The Telegraph aboard flight SA 543 from Johannesburg to this port city, Saturday morning.He added: In any case, pace alone can do things... Gives options, opens doors... The Indians have been good in conditions with more swing and bounce... Theyve picked wickets early and have consistently broken partnerships.The question, however, is: Can they maintain this strike-rate back home, where conditions are different? Also, will they be able to keep the momentum for not just one Test, but a series? For an honest appraisal, such questions need to be asked.According to Fanie, Srinath deserves much praise for excellent use of the conditions. Hes bowled at 140-plus, which is wonderful... Perhaps, hes spending more time at the gym... Perhaps, he hasnt ever been fitter...Commenting on Zaheer and Nehra, he said: The former hits the deck hard and gets movement after pitching  clearly, thats encouraging... As for Nehra, he is quick but doesnt appear very strong... Both need to be monitored and, in my opinion, only a specialist coach can do that.Reacting to the likelihood of Srinath quitting after the World Cup, Fanie quipped: If he can make more money outside the game, why not? After all, fast bowling isnt an easy vocation. If anything, it gets tougher when you are 30-plus.Picking the Srinath-headed attack as the No.2, behind Australias, he felt the projected India versus Australia final could go Indias way if wickets are taken early. As he put it: Continuing with the present formula may actually see the World Cup heading towards India.Significantly, Fanie remarked he would give a thought to any offer from the Board of Control for Cricket in India. I have the players respect... Ive played the game at the highest level... Im not lacking in the two qualities a full-fledged or specialist coach must have, he concluded, as the Boeing 737 began its descent.Fanies  Copyright

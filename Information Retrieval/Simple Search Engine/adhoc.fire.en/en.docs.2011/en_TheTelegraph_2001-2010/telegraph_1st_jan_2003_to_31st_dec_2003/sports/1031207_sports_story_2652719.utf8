 McGrath may return in a fortnight
Sydney, Dec. 6 (AFP): Australian pace spearhead Glenn McGrath is expected to make his return to cricket with New South Wales (NSW) within a fortnight, team officials said on Saturday. McGrath, who is recovering from ankle surgery, was not considered for selection in the NSW team named on Saturday for a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in Melbourne, beginning next Friday. But team officials said the 33-year-old McGrath was likely to be ready for the following week when NSW take on Tasmania here in a four-day game starting on December 19. The 430-Test wicket paceman has not played since minor surgery following the home Test series against Bangladesh in July. His recall comes after fellow Test speedster Brett Lee makes his return from injury in a one-day domestic match against Victoria in Melbourne on Sunday.  Copyright

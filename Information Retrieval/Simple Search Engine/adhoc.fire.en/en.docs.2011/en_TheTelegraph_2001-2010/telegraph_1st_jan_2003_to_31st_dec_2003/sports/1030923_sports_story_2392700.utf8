The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bagan, Tolly in last four
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Mohun Bagan and Tollygunge Agragami entered the semi-finals of the IFA Shield on Monday. In Malda, Tollygunge Agragami drew 1-1 with Mohammedan AC, while Bagan rode two Jose Ramirez Barreto strikes to record a 2-0 win against Railway FC in Haldia. Both the Mohun Bagan goals came in the first half. Railway FC had decided to keep Barreto strictly marked but the Brazilian still managed to weave his magic with his brilliant touch play. His first goal came in the 42nd minute when latching on to a Mehtab Hussain long pass, he struck with a right footer. It, however, appeared that he had pushed Abhijit Dutta on way to making the volley. The second goal, which came in injury time, was superb. Rennedy Singhs centre found Barreto, who shielded two rival players brilliantly before scoring with a left-footed volley. The Calcutta giants could have won by a bigger margin had Sunil Chettri not missed a couple of sitters. Two of Rennedys shots also hit the post. To add to Bagans woes, Hardip Singh Saini suffered a groin injury and is likely to miss the semi-final.  Draw good enough Mohammedan AC went into the lead in the fifth minute of the match through Arup Sarkar. In the dying minutes of the match, Tollygunges Laltu Das header, off a corner, found the Mohammedan AC net. Both teams, however, missed a lot of scoring chances. Mohammedan ACs Hamar shot wide from close in the 15th minute. In the 17th minute, Akeem Abolanle had only the rival goalkeeper to beat but he messed it up. Tollygunges Amit Das powerful shot in the 28th minute hit the bar and went out. Another Das shot in the second session was saved by the goalkeeper.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Reid for Aussie tour
	 - India Bowling Coach  FROM A CORRESPONDENT New Delhi: As expected the lanky Australian left-arm fast bowler of the Eighties, Bruce Reid, has been appointed Indias bowling coach till the end of the current tour of Australia. BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya confirmed this after an emergent working committee meeting on Sunday. Reid, who also assisted the Zimbabwean bowlers during their tour of Australia in September-October, is considered an astute and cerebral coach, according to the BCCI president. Though Reids salary was not disclosed, it is learnt that he will receive around $1,500 per week. Dalmiya added that no other names (read Wasim Akram, Jawagal Srinath and T.A. Sekar) were discussed. Dalmiya said: Our key bowler Zaheer Khan is not consistent and Ashish Nehra is returning after an injury break. Irfan Pathan is young and inexperienced, so a coach like Reid can help them become better bowlers. Dalmiya informed the BCCI has taken this decision after receiving an urgent request from the team management in Australia. He added they were concerned over the thrashing the Indian bowlers received in the opening match against Victoria. The working committee also approved Indias participation in a triangular one-day meet involving Australia and Pakistan prior to the Champions Trophy in England in September 2004. The venue and dates are yet to be finalised. Dalmiya also said a three-match limited-overs series against England will be held next year as part of Indias preparations for the Champions Trophy. This series will be in the first week of September. He announced that the U-17 Asia Cup will be in India in January. Sixteen teams , including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, will take part.

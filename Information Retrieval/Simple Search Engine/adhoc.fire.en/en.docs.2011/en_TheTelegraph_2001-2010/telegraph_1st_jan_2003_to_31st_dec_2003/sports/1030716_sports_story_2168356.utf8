The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Probables in the 1st week of August
 Mumbai: The 25-member Indian cricket probables for the preparatory camp to be held in Bangalore from August 14 to 26 would be picked either in Bangalore or here in the first week of August.The BCCI secretary S.K. Nair said on Tuesday that a few of the selectors were holidaying abroad and the selection committee would meet only after all of them are back in India by August 3.The Indian cricket team will have another one-week camp (conditioning) from September 1-6 before the New Zealanders arrive on September 23, he added.Nair said he was not aware whether former Aussie captain Greg Chappell would be assisting Team India coach John Wright during the preparatory and conditioning camps. Nair also said that the BCCIs marketing committee would meet here on July 23 and BCCIs brainchild, Corporate Cup, where all the Indian Test stars are expected to play for big companies , would be discussed during the working committee meeting to be held next month. That the BCCI intends to launch a Corporate Cup was first reported by The Telegraph last December. Initially, there were plans to introduce it this summer itself, but a lukewarm response from potential sponsors meant it can only be launched in 2004. Incidentally, the Player Terms row has also played a part in the Cup being put on hold.  Copyright

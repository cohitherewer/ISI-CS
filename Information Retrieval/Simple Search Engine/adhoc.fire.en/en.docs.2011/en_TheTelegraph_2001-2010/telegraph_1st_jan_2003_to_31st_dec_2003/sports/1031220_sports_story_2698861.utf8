The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hyderabad in sight of innings win
Hyderabad: Hyderabad tightened their grip on the game after dismissing Tamil Nadu for 240 in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match on Friday. Following on, Tamil Nadu were 37 for one, still needing 170 to make the hosts bat again. An innings win here will seriously boost Hyderabads chances of making the semi-finals and take their tally to 13 from five matches. With one more match to play after this, their chances of progressing are bright. Tamil Nadu have already made the cut. In the other Group B match in Ahmedabad, Karnataka did their bit to seal a semi-final berth, cornering Gujarat. After conceding a lead of 143 against Karnatakas 353, Gujarat were 152 for five in the second innings. Sunil Joshi took all five wickets. In Cuttack, a fine 107 by skipper Sanjay Raul enabled Orissa pile up 320 for eight against Saurashtra in a Plate Division match. Orissa are 92 runs ahead of the visitors first innings total. Raul, who shared a 101-run partnership with Pravanjan Mallick for the fourth wicket, batted for 342 minutes and hit 14 boundaries. Mallicks 60 contained six fours and a six. In Jamshedpur, Bihar were struggling at 71 for two in the second innings after conceding a lead of 111 to Haryana on the penultimate day of another Plate Division match. Bihar got off to a poor start losing two quick wickets. Opener Anant Prakash retired hurt. Rajiv Kumar, who hit a century in the first innings, steadied the ship in the company of Mohit Goel.

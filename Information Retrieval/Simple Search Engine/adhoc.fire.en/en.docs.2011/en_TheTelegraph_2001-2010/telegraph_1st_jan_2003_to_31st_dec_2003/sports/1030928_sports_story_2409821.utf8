The Telegraph - Calcutta
 BCCI sets ICC Nov. 1 deadline 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Jagmohan Dalmiya addressing the media on Saturday Calcutta, Sept. 27: The BCCI has set a November 1 deadline to the ICC for the release of its World Cup dues. The decision was taken at Saturdays annual general meeting of the BCCI. In view of the next meeting of the IDI Limited (the commercial arm of ICC) being on October 30 in Barbados, it was decided that if the dues are not cleared with interest by then, BCCI would resort to arbitration, said BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya. The ICC has withheld Indias guarantee money of $6.5 million for their participation in the World Cup in 2003. Dalmiya rubbished ICCs claim that Indias dilly-dally about participation in the World Cup and Champions Trophy led to the IDIs failure in selling to full potential the television slots for the two mega events. Weve come to know that 97.5-98 per cent of the television slots for the World Cup and 90-91 per cent for the Champions Trophy had been sold. So these claims of the ICC are absolutely baseless. The BCCI also approved in principle of the contract system and the graded payments for the international cricketers. A little bit of fine tuning is needed which will be done shortly, Dalmiya added. He also confirmed that 13 per cent of the BCCIs annual turnover will be given to the players participating in the domestic tournaments. 2.4 per cent of that amount will be reserved for the junior cricketers. The amount will be kept in fixed deposit account and the players will get the money once they reach the age of 21, the president pointed out. He also added that the idea is to ensure a player participating in the first-class tournaments for 10 years without playing a single international match gets to earn something in the region of Rs 25-30 lakhs by the end of his career. The BCCI, meanwhile, is also planning to revive the national inter-university tournament  the Vizzy Trophy. In fact, we plan to have matches between the Combined University and the touring sides in the near future, Dalmiya said. On recommendation of the technical committee, the points system for the three and four-day matches in the domestic tournaments has been revised. According to the new system, a team winning outright gets four points while a victory by ten wickets or an innings fetches an extra bonus. A team getting a first innings lead gets two points while a team losing a match or conceding a first lead innings lead draws a blank. The BCCI office-bearers was selected unanimously, with Professor Ratnakar Shetty and Jyoti Bajpai becoming the new joint secretary and treasurer, respectively. However, Dalmiya and S.K. Nair will continue to serve the BCCI as its president and secretary.  OFFICE BEARERS  BCCI  President: Jagmohan Dalmiya; Secretary:  S.K.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Barua plans academy
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Reaching 2600 Elo rating points is not Grandmaster Dibyendu Baruas only dream. He wants to give something back to the game that has given him everything by setting up an academy in the city. Barua has approached the state government for a plot of land at a reduced rate and hopes to get the building ready by 2005-06. I will stay an active player for at least another four years and wish to devote my time to the academy after that, Barua said Monday. In fact, the reigning Commonwealth chess champion has seen a plot near the EM Bypass, which suits his demands. Getting a waiver from the state government will be a great help. Indias second GM after Viswanathan Anand, Barua, actually has a grand plan. He wants a three-storied building, with a hall for tournaments, rooms for weight training, yoga and meditation apart from staying arrangements. It wont be a residential academy, but trainees will frequently undergo 15-day camps. All of them will be below the age of 16, and though the number of trainees will depend on how much of land we get, I intend to accommodate 300. Barua, who will start approaching corporate bodies to back his project after getting the land, thinks expenses may run up to Rs 2 crore. But it wont be before about four years that he will focus solely on grooming young talents.  Copyright

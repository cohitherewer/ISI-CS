The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Indians now believe in their ability
 - National selector David Boon says Australians dont have to panic  FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  David Boon  Boon thinks Pontings  success as 
 Test captain is certainHobart: Ricky Ponting is growing in stature, but the top cricket icon in these parts remains the stocky David Boon. Among the most accomplished and successful openers of his time, Boon is currently a national selector as also the Media and Public Relations Manager of the Tasmanian Cricket Association (TCA). In fact, the TCA has immortalised him by erecting a bronze statue within the precincts of the Bellerive Oval, surely about the prettiest ground anywhere. In Perth on assignment, Boon spoke to The Telegraph over his cellphone on Friday afternoon.  The following are excerpts On being in an unusual position  as selector, with Australia trailing in the four-Test series Its the result of a new steel in the Indian team... Theyve begun to believe they can be winners overseas and their Adelaide victory was fantastic. Our bowlers did well in that Test, but the Indians batting was outstanding. Even in Brisbane, they competed right through the match.  On what needs to be done  by Australia We dont have to panic, mate... Surely, one can lose a game... Obviously, I wouldnt have liked Australia to be behind but, then, look at what the Adelaide result has done for this series and the world of cricket.  On Australia being hit by  injuries to key bowlers Yes, injuries never help... Moreover, its difficult matching the standards set by a Glenn McGrath. At the same time, I think our bowlers responded well in Adelaide. Its just that the batting was exceptional.  On the difference between  this Indian team and the earlier ones I dont wish to belittle the Indian greats of the past but, in the earlier times, a score of 556 (by Australia) would have encouraged straightaway playing for a draw. Yet, in the second Test, the Indians displayed a brand of cricket which suggested they could win. Eventually, they did.  On whether Sourav Gangulys  captaincy has made a difference I havent studied his innings as captain and, so, cant make a definite comment. What I can say is that he has a game plan and is getting the best out of his players. He should be happy.  On his expectations at the  start of this series I knew it wouldnt be easy, simply because five of the top six Indian batsmen are world class, but I did think Australia would have the upperhand. Id expected the Indians to take longer in getting adjusted to the bouncy wickets. Of course, Rahul Dravids form has made such a difference... Now, Australia must play very good cricket to stop India from forcing an unprecedented series win.  On Dravid Is extremely composed, has an excellent technique... He isnt as flamboyant as some of the others, but that doesnt make a difference. Indeed, Dravid prides himself on a job well done.  On whether Sachin Tendulkar  is getting weighed down by pressure Look, hes a great and all great players are under plenty of pressure... Im sure its a matter of time before he gets going... Only, from an Australian perspective, I hope its not in the two Tests (Melbourne and Sydney) that remain.  On the opening pair of Virender  Sehwag and Akash Chopra Its a good combination, because theres a mix of aggression and occupation of the crease. Chopra is happy spending time in the middle, while Sehwag is an accomplished strokemaker.  On a middle-order batsman  (Sehwag) being made to open Nothing wrong with that... However, the batsman must have the desire and hunger to open. I feel batsmen should be flexible. I myself batted both as opener and down in the order.  On the debate whether the  Indians should field two specialist spinners in the XI The selection must wholly be influenced by the conditions... For example, the SCG is known to offer turn, but its to be seen how the latest wicket looks. Nothing must be pre-empted.  On Matthew Hayden (Laughs) Im glad Im not a bowler in this era... If I was, I would hate bowling to him. The last three years have seen a different Hayden... He has understood his own cricket better and plays within himself...  On whether it will be difficult  for Ponting to carry forward the Steve Waugh legacy Theres a time for change in everybodys career and life... Steve has made an enormous contribution and Im sure there will be a bit of Steve in Ponting, just as there was a bit of Allan Border in Mark Taylor and a bit of Taylor in Steve... Ponting has already made a big impact as one-day captain and, clearly, I dont see why his Test captaincy will be any different.  On Ponting deciding to attend  wife Riannas graduation (on Friday) instead of captaining  Tasmania versus New South Wales. I dont have a comment.  Finally, on one-time teammate  Bruce Reid signing up as Indias bowling coach I don't have a problem with that...  We all want our national team to do well, but everybody  has some responsibility towards helping the sport too...  Coaching another national side is one way of doing so.  Copyright

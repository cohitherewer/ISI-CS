				 																																	New Delhi: Indian duo Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have been given top billing at the $ 355,000 ATP Tour at Long Island, New York.				 																																	Bhupathi and Paes will be sharing the same side of the court for the first time in 15 months when they take on Gustavo Kuerten and Flavio Saretta of Brazil in the first round.				 																																	Bhupathi and Paes are pairing up since their respective partners, Max Mirnyi of Belarus and David Rikl of the Czech Republic, have opted out of the Long Island event which comes exactly one week before the US Open. Both will revert to their respective partners for the years final Grand Slam which begins next week. 				 																																	Mumbai: Isha Lakhani and Sonal Phadke did India proud by winning satellite titles in Thailand and Nigeria, respectively, on Saturday.

Sonal got the better of third seed Michelle Snyman of South Africa 6-2, 6-4 to win the tournament at Lagos in Nigeria. 				 																																	Santo Domingo: Antigua cyclist Charles Fabian became the fourth athlete to fail a dope test at the Pan American Games, organisers said on Sunday. Fabian tested positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine following the 50-km road time trial on August 8, the Pan American Sports Organisation (ODEPA) said in a statement. Fabian was 19th in the 20-rider event with a time of 1:16.45. Colombias Jose Serpa won in 1:04.45.				 																																	The other three athletes to fail tests at the games were all medal winners.				 																																	Doha: Former Argentine international Gabriel Batistuta formally signed a two-year contract worth $8 million with Qatars Al Arabi Sports Club on Sunday.				 																																	The 34-year-old will be paid $5 million in the first year and $3m in the second to train Qatari footballers and play for the club, said a source close to Al Arabi.				 																																	Batistuta, Argentinas leading goalscorer with 56 goals in 78 appearances, said he took the Al Arabi offer because Qatar had fascinated him on his first visit during the finals of the Emiri Cup in 2002.				 																																	I saw a big challenge in Qatar and that was the reason behind opting for this offer. I would like to give my best and score as many goals as possible, Batistuta said.

 Im not feeling good: Sourav
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Calcutta, Oct. 18: The  abscess on Team India captain Sourav Gangulys left upper  thigh was dressed under anaesthesia on Saturday. He was  later declared stable by doctors who, though, were yet to  decide when Sourav could return to on-field action.  Im not feeling good  The wound  has been cut up once again and, so, you can understand the  pain, is what Sourav told The Telegraphs Special  Correspondent, who is now in Chandigarh, late on Saturday  night.  Sourav indicated that he may have  to remain in the nursing home till as late as Monday morning.  For all intents and purposes, he is out of the opening tri-series  match and is doubtful for the next two. The decision for the surgical procedure was taken late on Friday night by a medical board set up after Sourav consulted his doctor upon returning to the city. The skipper, complaining of excruciating pain in the affected area, was admitted to Belle Vue Clinic early on Saturday, where he underwent the half-hour procedure to hasten his recovery. It was carried out by a team of six doctors including Dr Mrinmoy Nandi. Dr Sukumar Mukherjee had been consulted by the Indian skipper earlier. The doctors said at a press briefing later that the wound was found to be filled up with slough and pus. Under non-intubating light general anaesthesia, the wound was debrided of slough and dressed and the margin of the wound trimmed. Sourav has regained consciousness and has talked to his family members. (His wife Dona was beside him at the clinic). His condition is being monitored closely and he is on a course of parenteral fluids, antibiotics and analgesics. He is also on normal diet. The decision to release the skipper will be taken tomorrow morning after a review of his condition.  Copyright

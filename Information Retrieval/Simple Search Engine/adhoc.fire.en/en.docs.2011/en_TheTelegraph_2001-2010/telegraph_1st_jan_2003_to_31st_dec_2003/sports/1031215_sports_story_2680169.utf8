 Not second stringers: IHF
New Delhi: Indian hockey authorities Sunday hit back at their Malaysian counterparts who have threatened to scrap the second-string Indian team from participating in next months Azlan Shah invitational tournament in Kuala Lumpur. One cannot dictate terms to us on the composition of the Indian team. We are sending the team keeping in mind the upcoming Olympic qualifiers and the Athens Olympics, Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) secretary K. Jyothikumaran said. He was reacting to media reports which quoted Malaysian Hockey Federation secretary S. Satgunam as saying: We will not accept India for the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup if they are sending their second stringers. Jyothikumaran said it would be incorrect to call the Indian team as junior or second-string since 16 of the 25 probables attending the camp have represented the country at international tournaments. How can you call a team junior or second-string when 16 of the players have played at international level? They have no right to call it so. Moreover, keeping in mind the ability of the Indians to draw huge crowds to the stadium in Malaysia, we are giving special attention to the tournament, he said. He said Indias decision to call new faces to the camp was taken in view of injuries to some players and the upcoming Olympics. How can we continue playing with Deepak Thakur or Kanwalpreet Singh, who are not fully fit? We can assure that we will have a meaningful and purposeful tournament. Germany sent a third-rung team to an important event like the Champions Trophy in the name of preparations for the Olympics and the FIH (games world governing body) could do nothing, Jyothikumaran said. The Olympic year is on us, and we cannot underestimate our preparations at any cost.  (PTI)  Copyright

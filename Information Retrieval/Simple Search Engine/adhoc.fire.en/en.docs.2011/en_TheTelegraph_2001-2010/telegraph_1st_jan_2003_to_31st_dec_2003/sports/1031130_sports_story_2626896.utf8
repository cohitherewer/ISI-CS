The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Sunday, November 30, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 There were no surprises in the mens semi-finals of the national squash championships. Top seed Ritwick Bhattacharya of Delhi booked his berth after outplaying Maharashtras Sahil Vora 9-3, 9-0, 9-2 at the Calcutta Racket Club on Saturday. Second seed Saurav Ghosal was not as authoritative against third seed Gaurav Nandrajog (Delhi), but still won 9-7, 9-4, 9-3.				 																																																	Womens top seed Joshna Chinappa, the under-19 national champion, cruised into the title round with a 9-0, 9-1, 9-0 rout of local girl Neha Rathi. In the other semi-final, Tamil Nadus Sonali Philip rallied to oust Surbhi Misra of Rajasthan 8-10, 9-4, 9-2, 9-6.				 																																																	 Nostalgia ruled at the East Bengal ground on Saturday afternoon when stars of yesteryears paraded their skills in front of a galaxy of Olympians ranging from Ahmed Khan and Sahu Mewalal to P.K. Banerjee, Chuni Goswami and Leslie Claudius. The occasion was the golden jubilee celebrations of Veterans Club, which made the afternoon a reality with IFAs association.				 																																																	Even as the Surajit Senguptas pitted their ageing limbs against the Victor Amalrajs, Ahmed Khan  whose last match during a long association with East Bengal was in 1963  was the cynosure beyond the sidelines. 				 																																																	The double-Olympian saw no hope of Indias soccer standards going up, with or without a foreign coach. Players of this age dont take pride representing their country it was different in our time, he observed.				 																																																	For the record, Mohammedan Sporting won the championship beating East Bengal 3-2 via penalties. In earlier games, East Bengal got the better of Veterans Club 4-3 and Mohammedan Sporting beat Mohun Bagan 5-4  also via tie-breakers.				 																																																	 Zimbabwean defender David is free to don Mohun Bagan jerseys in the National Football League, but theres a catch: Brazilian striker Marcos Parreira will have to be released as otherwise Aloke Mukherjees team will end up with five foreigners  including new Brazilian duo Eduardo and Leonardo, who are expected to get their ITCs on Monday and sign the same day. 				 																																																	We cant release Marcos just like that as we have a contract with him. We sat with him today and made an offer... hell let us know either way on Monday. Well take a decision on signing David only after that, , said assistant secretary Balaram Chowdhury.

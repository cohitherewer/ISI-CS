 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 Mallesh				 										Mysore: The unfancied Allies Serenade, from Darius Byramjis yard, was ridden by Mallesh Narredu to an impressive victory over her highly fancied stable-mate Son Of The Light in the 2,000m Poonawalla Mysore Derby on Sunday, the concluding day of the season here.				 										The race was run at a fast pace and it was Smart Striker who tried to steal a march from the start while her fancied yard-mate Star Of Windsor followed ahead of Chilli Girl. The 6-4 favourite Son Of The Light was, on the other hand, happily settled in-fourth with Allies Serenade, Royal Affinity and the Western India challenger Strike Zone running in close attendance.				 										Smart Striker called it a day passing the 600m marker, leaving Star Of Windsor in command. He, too, however, failed to contain Chiili Girl and Royal Affinity 200m from home. It was only in the final 100m that Allies Serenade jumped on to the scene with a strong finishing run to take all, including the favourite, by surprise.				 										The season was, however, dominated by the trainer-jockey combination of Robert Foley-B. Prakash who claimed championships in their respective fields.				 										Meanwhile, trainer Madhu Mangalorkars ward Dover was also found to be suffering from colic, the killer disease. The chances of the five-year-old mares survival are learnt to be 50-50.

		 Saturday, January 25, 2003 				 Warne aims for special swansong
																								Melbourne: Shane Warne Friday said he was hoping to be able to achieve something special in Saturdays second tri-series final against England.																								 Warne will be making his final one-day International appearance in front of his home crowd at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hopefully, I can do something special for the crowd, said Warne, who said earlier this week he will quit ODIs after the World Cup next month.																								Theyve been so supportive over a long time. It would be great to go out on top, hopefully by winning and then going to the World Cup and winning that. (AFP)

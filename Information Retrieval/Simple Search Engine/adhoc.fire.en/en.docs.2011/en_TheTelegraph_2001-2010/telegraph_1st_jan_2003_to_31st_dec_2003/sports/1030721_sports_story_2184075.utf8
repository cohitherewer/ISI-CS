 Steve: Ive done a pretty good job
  Steve Waugh Darwin: Steve Waugh replaced West Indian great Clive Lloyd as the most successful Test captain when he led Australia to victory over Bangladesh on Sunday.Waugh chalked up his 37th win as skipper, surpassing the previous world record of 36 set by Lloyd in the 1980s, with a strike rate unmatched in crickets long history.It was a bit of a slow start and a real learning process in the first 12 months, but I feel Ive improved along the way and done a pretty good job, Waugh said. Ive been fortunate enough to have some great players in my side, guys who can really make the game, so its been a real team effort.Waughs 37 wins came from just 50 matches in charge while Lloyd needed 74 matches for his 36 wins. Waughs winning strike rate of 74 per cent is easily the highest by any captain who has been in charge for at least 20 Tests with the late Don Bradmans success rate of 62.50 the second best. Lloyd and Border are both under 50 per cent.Waugh only took over the captaincy in 1999 when Mark Taylor stood down but has quickly established himself as a strong leader and his team is already being compared to Bradmans 1948 Invincibles, arguably the greatest side of all time.Waugh attributes his success to the teams aggressive strategy of scoring quickly because it allows them to take the weather out of the equation then bowl and field aggressively. Its a positive way that we play and we like to try and win in quick time, Waugh said. A lot of games are finishing early but I think the quality of cricket we put out in that period of time is much better than five boring days. (Reuters)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pathan, Sarandeep rip through Elite B 
Bangalore: Irfan Pathan (Jr) and Sarandeep Singh claimed three wickets each as Elite A bundled out Elite B for 219 on the opening day of their Duleep Trophy match here on Thursday. Elite B skipper M.S.K. Prasad was left regretting his decision to bat first, as his batsmen, barring Wasim Jaffer (62) and Vinayak Mane (39), failed to click. Jaffer hit six fours in his 140-ball innings and put on 77 runs for the second wicket with Mane, after opener Amit Pagnis fell cheaply (11), adjudged leg before to Pathan. Elite B were comfortably placed at 98 for two at one stage but the middle order and the tail-enders let them down. The last four wickets yielded just 38 runs as the Elite A bowlers asserted their supremacy. Pathan and Sarandeep returned identical figures of three for 53, ending Elite Bs innings in 80.1 overs. In reply, Reetinder Singh Sodhi-led Elite A, looking to salvage some pride after three unimpressive league engagements, were 29 without loss off seven overs at stumps. Kale hits 98 for Plate A In Hyderabad, despite a defiant 98 by Abhijit Kale, star-studded Elite C restricted Plate A to 241 for eight on the opening day of their Duleep Trophy match at the Gymkhana Grounds. Put in to bat, Plate A started on a disastrous note losing three quick wickets for 37 runs with speedsters Ajit Agarkar, S.K. Trivedi and Amit Bhandari bowling a tight line and length in their opening spells. Kale, selected in the national squad for the tri-nation series in Dhaka next week, stemmed the rot by with Yashpal Singh in a brilliant 87-run partnership for the fourth wicket before Yashpal was out after scoring a watchful 33 from 105 deliveries. Kale then went on to compile 59 for the fifth wicket with Rajeev Kumar but fell two short of his century. He struck 19 fours in his 178-ball knock. Rajeev, on 47, was at the crease along with K. Ananthapadmanabhan (3) at stumps. Young Parthiv Patel took four catches behind the stumps and was responsible for the dismissals of Barrington (17), Hrishikesh Kanitkar (5), V.S.T. Naidu (11) and Dodda Ganesh (10). SUMMARISED SCORES n In Bangalore: Elite B 219 (W. Jaffer 62, V. Mane 39; I. Pathan 3/53, S. Singh 3/53). Elite A 29/0. Match to continue. n In Hyderabad: Plate A 241/8 (A. Kale 98, Y. Singh 33, Rajeev Kumar 47 batting; S.K. Trivedi 3/48, A. Bhandari 2/55). Match to continue.  (PTI)  Copyright

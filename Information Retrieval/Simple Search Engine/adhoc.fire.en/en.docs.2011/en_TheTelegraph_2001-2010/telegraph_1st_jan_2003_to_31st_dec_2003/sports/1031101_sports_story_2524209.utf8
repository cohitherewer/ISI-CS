The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England corner Bangladesh
Chittagong: Nasser Hussain narrowly missed a century as England took a commanding 467-run lead after Richard Johnsons five-wicket haul saw Bangladesh collapse to 152 all out in the first innings. Former captain Hussain, who had scored a pedestrian 76 in Englands first innings 326, recovered from a slow start to hammer 15 fours and a six in his 143-ball 95. But the 35-year-old was caught and bowled five short of what would have been his 14th Test century, deceived in the air by left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique. Hussain shared in a 138-run stand for the third wicket with Graham Thorpe (54), who put behind his first innings duck as England reached 293 for five at stumps. Im disappointed at not getting a 100. But I knew I had to get it today, so I went for the runs. In the first innings, we needed a big total and three wickets had just gone down. This time we had to push the scoring rate, Hussain said. Bangladesh lost paceman Mashrafe Mortaza, who had grabbed a career-best four for 60 in the first innings, when he fell over clutching his right knee during his fourth over. He was taken for an MRI scan and returned with his knee in a plaster cast, ruled out for at least three weeks.  Johnson (five for 49) had earlier done the damage with a spell of four for 23 which ensured a 174-run first innings lead for the visitors. It was the 28-year-olds second five-wicket haul in two matches following his debut six for 33 against Zimbabwe at Chester-le-Street earlier this year. Bangladesh started the day on 93 for four but Johnson dismissed Rajin Saleh (32), caught behind while going for a loose drive, and got Khaled Mashud (0), fending a bouncer to substitute Paul Collingwood at gully. Skipper Khaled Mahmud (15) was the next to go, caught at gully, and Mortaza (1) was his final victim, bowled while going for a swipe across the line. England were one bowler short with Rikki Clarke out due to fever and nausea but Johnson, who had dismissed opener Javed Omar on Thursday, took over to almost single-handedly set up a big win for his team. Martin Saggers grabbed two wickets on debut, Mushfiqur Rahman (28) and last man Enamul Haque (9). England replied with a 66-run opening stand between Mark Butcher (42), opening because of a thumb injury to Marcus Trescothick, and captain Michael Vaughan (25). Trescothick hurt his left thumb while going for a slip catch on Thursday but X-Rays have ruled out a fracture. He came on to bat at No. 7 in the days last over. Butcher batted with authority before Rafique had him caught behind. Vaughan was run out after a horrible misunderstanding with Hussain over a single to point. Hussain struck a flurry of boundaries to raise his 50 off 89 deliveries and celebrated by hoisting off-spinner Saleh for a big straight six.  (REUTERS)  Copyright

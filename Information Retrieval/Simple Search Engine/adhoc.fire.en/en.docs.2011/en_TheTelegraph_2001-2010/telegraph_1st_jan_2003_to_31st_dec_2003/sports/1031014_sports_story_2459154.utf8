The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Streak delays the inevitable
Perth: Australia defeated Zimbabwe by a massive innings and 175 runs Monday on the fifth and final day of the first cricket Test at the WACA Ground. Zimbabwes brave second innings resistance was finally broken after another hour and-a-half, leaving the team all out for 321  their biggest second innings total in Test ranks. They were skittled for 239 in their first innings in reply to Australias mammoth 735 for six wickets declared. Play started on time Monday after heavy rain had washed out play late Sunday, but further rain in the morning sent the players off for another 18 minutes. Tenth-wicket stand of captain Heath Streak and Ray Price continued to defy the depleted Australian attack until fast bowler Andy Bichel trapped the latter. Streak made 71 not out and Price 36. They forged a tenth-wicket stand of 74  the best in Tests in Perth. Streak completed a commendable 50 when he viciously cut a ball from speedster Brett Lee to the backward point boundary. The milestone was posted in 212 minutes, from 159 balls, with five fours. It was Streaks ninth half-century in Test ranks. He has yet to complete a century at this level, his best score being 87. Australia continued to be handicapped by the absence of frontline bowlers Jason Gillespie and Stuart MacGill. Paceman Gillespie has a sore left side, while MacGill has a problem with his right calf. Both players were forced to leave the ground Saturday, leaving Australia with their most depleted attack in many Tests. Ace paceman Glenn McGrath did not start in this Test because of a left ankle injury.  (AFP)  Copyright

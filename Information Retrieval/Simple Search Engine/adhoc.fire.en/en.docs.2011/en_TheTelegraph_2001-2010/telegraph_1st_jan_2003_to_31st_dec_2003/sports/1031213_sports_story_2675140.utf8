The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We showed what we can do: Rohan
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Rohan Calcutta: It was celebration time in the Bengal camp after a long time, and skipper Rohan Gavaskar said Fridays victory over Hyderabad only showed what the team is capable of. Rohan opined that application was the key to the win. We had our back against the wall before this game and have shown everyone what we are capable of, he said. He identified the number of useful partnerships as another factor behind the win. It was a special win since the team was under pressure, he added. Coach Karsan Ghavri defended the decision to play with just four specialist batsmen and fielding a third spinner, who bowled all of six overs in the match. We didnt use him more often because others were doing well. CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya, who gave the players some pep talk before the match and was present at the ground almost everyday, announced an incentive of Rs 30,000 for the team.  Copyright

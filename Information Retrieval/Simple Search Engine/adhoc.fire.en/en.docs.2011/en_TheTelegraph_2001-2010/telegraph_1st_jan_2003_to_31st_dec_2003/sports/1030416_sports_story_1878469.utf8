 Pak board wants 60-member pool
Islamabad: The PCB Tuesday invited 76 young cricketers for a two-day camp in Lahore which will act as selection trials for setting up a 60-player national pool. Those invited include some of the members of Pakistans squads at the World Cup in South Africa last month and Sharjah Cup four-nation meet last week. The 60 short-listed players will be divided into five teams which will play matches among themselves from April 18 to 24 in Lahore, a PCB press release said. The idea is to identify young talent and expose them before the newly-appointed selection committee. It would also help them in selecting Pakistan teams for forthcoming assignments, a PCB spokesman said. Pakistan will tour Sri Lanka and England in the next two months and is also scheduled to host Bangladesh and South Africa between august and November. Some slots are still available in the Pakistan team. Besides, we want to have, at least, two to three back up players for every place so that if a top performer is not available for any reason, the replacement is equally good, chief selector Aamir Sohail said.

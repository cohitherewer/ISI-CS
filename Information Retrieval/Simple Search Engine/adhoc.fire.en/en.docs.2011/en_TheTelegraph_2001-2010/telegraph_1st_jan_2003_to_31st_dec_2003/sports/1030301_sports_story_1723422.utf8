The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India certain to bring out the best  in us
 Shoaib and Razzaq can get Pakistan  back in business Fast Track / Wasim Akram Shoaib Akhtar: Watch  out for him This is a moment that both countries  and both teams have been waiting for, for three years   an India-Pakistan match. I have always enjoyed the pressure,  the challenge and the atmosphere of an India-Pakistan game,  and this one will be no different. There are some old on-pitch  duels to resume, and a few new ones to look forward to. There is no arguing that India  has been more impressive than Pakistan in the tournament  so far. However, there is also no question that whenever  we play India, our performance goes up a few notches. There  is no reason why that should not be the case tomorrow. The key tussle will be between  our bowlers and the top Indian batsmen. Getting Sachin Tendulkar  out early will be priority No. 1, as he is the worlds top  batsman at present, and his dismissal invariably has a huge  impact on the Indians. When the two teams played each  other in a spate of games in 1999-2000, Abdul Razzaq dismissed  the little maestro on three-four occasions. Razzaq was at  his peak then, and is admittedly a little off-colour in  this tournament. I know that he has always prided himself  in being able to get Tendulkar out, and perhaps this challenge  will see him coming back to the form he enjoyed in the last  World Cup.			 Virender Sehwag is the other player  all the Pakistan bowlers are itching to get at. I enjoy  watching him play, but have not bowled to him till now.  We have been doing a fair bit of homework on him as well  as on Yuvraj Singh, Mohammad Kaif and Dinesh Mongia, some  of the other Indian batsmen who we have not played against.  Weve watched them, plotted and planned. It now remains  to be seen whether we can put all those strategies into  action successfully. Since we last played each other,  India has found two fine bowlers in Ashish Nehra and Zaheer  Khan. They have proved that its not just Indias batsmen  who can win games, their bowlers are also capable of doing  that. I met Nehra in Delhi when I was there last, and it  was flattering to know that he is an admirer of mine. We  discussed left-arm bowling there and during the ICC Champions  Trophy I spoke to both Nehra and Zaheer. They are hard-working  boys who are eager to learn and always trying to improve. On the Pakistani side of things,  our batting has been a bit of a concern. Inzamam is going  through a bad phase, and the media back home as well as  here are giving him a rough time. Like Allan Donald, Inzamam  is a proven performer, and one good game can change things  for both these guys. Bad form is temporary, and Inzamam  has the class to overcome it and make a contribution. There is no doubt that Saturdays  game will be much more competitive than some of our past  encounters. The players to watch out for are Shoaib and  Razzaq. If they both have a good game, Pakistan will be  in business. We have been working hard, and  our team spirit and morale have not been affected by the  reversals we have faced. We are hanging out together a lot  more, and we have a team room wherever we go, so that players  are encouraged to play pool, darts and generally have a  relaxed time together. That bonhomie was there for the world  to see when the team got together to honour me when I reached  500 wickets in ODIs. It was touching to receive 500 roses  from the guys, and I was happy to realise that they were  sharing my joy at reaching this landmark. There were reports in the Indian  media that I said that I found the comments of Navjyot Singh  Sidhu intolerable. I think I was misunderstood. All I said  was that if I ever take up the microphone, I would be a  little more sympathetic to the players, and would prefer  to comment on their technique and what they are doing right/wrong,  instead of questioning their ability. Everyone would agree  that nobody would be playing for their country if they did  not possess ability. I know Sidhu and find him a decent  guy. His commentary has a bit of Punjabi humour  which  I enjoy  and I also like his up front attitude in the commentary  box. Tomorrows game is a big one for  both sides, but I would like everybody watching it to relax,  enjoy the game, enjoy the pressure and remember that whatever  the result may be, its only a game.

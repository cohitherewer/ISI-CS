 Knight retires from ODIs
London: England opener Nick Knight on Sunday announced his retirement from one-day cricket. The 33-year-old, hit by a niggling knee injury recently, has played in one hundred ODIs  averaging 40.41 and hitting five centuries. His departure leaves coach Duncan Fletcher with the task of finding a suitable replacement for the man described as a fantastic servant to the one-day game by chairman of selectors David Graveney. On hearing the news Graveney said: It was a surprise, certainly, and I think Duncan would feel the same way. Knight said he had been mulling over retirement for some time. Ive been thinking about it for a while. I was desperate to play in the World Cup, but Ive got other challenges ahead of me. Its nice to spend some time at home and at Warwickshire. He added: There is an incredible amount of talent in the game, its four years before the next World Cup, Im not going to make it, so its a chance for other guys to make it. (AFP)  Copyright

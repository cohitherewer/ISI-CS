		 Tuesday, September 23, 2003  Another Time for Monsoon Cup 
 BY STAR RACER		 MerchantCalcutta: The three horses  Another Time, Smart Ruler and No Regrets  who are capable of landing the Tuesdays main event, the 2,000m Monsoon Cup, are closely handicapped.				 										However, it is Another Time who gets the first call. She was impressive in her defeat in the Prince Blossom Cup. In that race, carrying the topweight, the Steinbeck-Alarming four-year-old filly was seen closing up to the winner Hello Brother (52 kg), also a contender in the days four-horse line-up. With substantial reduction at the weights and Amyn Merchant to guide, the Daniel David-trainee may just about have the measure of her stable-mate Smart Ruler and No Regrets, who are horses for the course, but both are yet to reproduce their known form this season. 				 										Queen Of The Nile may win the 2,000m Retort Handicap. Ignore her Derby run as the Dark Nile-City Queen daughter was made to set pace in the big event.

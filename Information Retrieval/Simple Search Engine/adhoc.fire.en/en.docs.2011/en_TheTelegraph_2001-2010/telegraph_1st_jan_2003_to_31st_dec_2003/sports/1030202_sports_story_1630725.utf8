		 Sunday, February 02, 2003  The professional opinion 
 FROM HONKY DORY				 										Mumbai, Feb. 1: Majority of professionals were of opinion that it is Classical Act who will be the hardest to beat in the McDowell Indian Derby tomorrow if the Vijay Mallaya horse fully has recovered from his training setback. The following are the opinions expressed by some of the leading contenders: 				 										Trainers:				 										l C. D. Katrak: I hope Aldenburgh wins me the first Derby.				 										l Dallas Todywalla: I shall be rooting for boss Star Strider. But he may have to beat Classical Act who seems to have recovered from his training setback.				 										l Imtiaz Sait: Classical Act is the one to beat. He seems to be coming right. But dont write off my Oaks wi-nning filly Twin Star. She is on the up.				 										l Jaggy Dhariwal: We have done every possible thing to put Classical Act back to the track. I am sure he will do well in the race.				 										l S. Padmanabhan: My Zurbaran is back to his winning ways. He will beat Classical Act and Aldeburgh, my main rivals.				 										l Vinayak: In my opinion Spaniards Inn is the best stayer in the field. I give him a good chance to win me the Derby.				 										Jockeys:				 										l Mark Gallagher: Its a race between Star Strider and Classical Act.				 										l Mallesh Narredu: Having worked on all the three horses owned by Mr Khusru Dhunjibhoi I have picked up Aldeburgh. I hope to win (Zurbaran and Spaniards Inn are also owned by Dhunjibhoy)				 										l Pesi Shroff: Classical Acts problems are over. He is capable of beating the present lot.

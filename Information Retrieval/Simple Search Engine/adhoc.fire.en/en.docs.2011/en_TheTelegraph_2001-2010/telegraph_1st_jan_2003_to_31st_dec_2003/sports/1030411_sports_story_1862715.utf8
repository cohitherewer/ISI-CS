 ACB to decide Warnes cricket dos and donts at weekend
Sydney: The Australian Cricket Board said they would this weekend decide what disgraced Shane Warne could do during his one-year doping ban. The ACB meets in Bowral, in the New South Wales southern highlands, from Friday with Warnes immediate future on the agenda. Warne has been ousted from cricket until February 10 next year after testing positive to a banned diuretic in January. The Lashings Cricket Club in England has offered him a place in their line-up, while he has also been informally linked with the St Kilda AFL club. Earlier in his ban, Victoria coach David Hookes said he was prepared to allow Warne to practice at nets with the state team.  Regardless of what cricket is proposed, whether its official or unofficial, we need to see it before it can be approved under the terms of Warnes playing contract, ACB public affairs manager Peter Young said last month. On the face of it, a privately-owned club (lashings) does not seem appropriate. Warne cannot play for money while he is banned but the issue of playing for charity will be discussed this weekend, an ACB spokesman said on Thursday. Warne and his manager, brother Jason, have talked about the scope of Warnes cricket involvement with ACB operations manager Michael Brown. Warnes unofficial role at St Kilda could also be up for discussion. Warne has been involved on an ad-hoc basis and the club doesnt expect his position to be made official. The ACB is not expected to make an announcement on Warnes future until at least Monday as any decision has to be conveyed to Warne before being made public.  (AFP)  Copyright

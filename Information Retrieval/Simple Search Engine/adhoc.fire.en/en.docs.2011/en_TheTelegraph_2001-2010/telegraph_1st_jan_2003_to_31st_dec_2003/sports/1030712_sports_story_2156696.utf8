		 Saturday, July 12, 2003  Syces, jockeys back on track 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 	 Puttanna				 										Bangalore: Following hard bargaining, the BTC syces called off their stir late on Friday, stubbing out a strike that could have disrupted Sundays Derby. The Syces had served a 15-day notice demanding a pay revision.				 										B. Puttanna, president Bangalore Trainers Association (BTA) informed that the BTA has agreed to the syces demands after some hard bargaining. The BTA has also agreed to look into grievances about improvement in their working conditions. Syces, who are currently paid Rs 3,000 per month, were demanding an increment of Rs 500 but settled for Rs 3,400.				 										Meanwhile, the striking jockeys were back in business from Thursday, following a bit of drama between the Jockey Association of India (JAI) and the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) during the last three days 				 										The, JAI, in their letter dated July 7, had informed the BTC that they were willing to take up their riding duties immediately on withdrawal of BTCs advisory dated June 26. However, BTC had retaliated asking the JAI that this would be done only after it withdrew their strike notice of June 20 and also give an undertaking that there would be no such call for a strike in future. In the end, BTC never pressed for an undertaking after JAI withdrew the strike notice.				 										The matter regarding enhancement of Jockeys mount fees was taken up at a meeting of the All India Racehorse Owners Association (AIRA) on Friday. The meeting was presided by Vijay Mallya who has constituted a five-member committee to hold discussions with JAI in respect of mount fee revision.

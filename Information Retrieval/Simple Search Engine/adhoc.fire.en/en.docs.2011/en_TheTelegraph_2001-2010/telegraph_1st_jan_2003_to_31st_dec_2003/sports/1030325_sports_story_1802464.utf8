The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhupathi, Mirnyi set to resume partnership 
 BY AMITAVA DAS GUPTA  MIRNYI amp; BHUPATHI Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi has convinced Max Mirnyi to relaunch their profitable old firm. The Indo-Belarussian duo will be back in harness from the Monte Carlo Masters Series meet, in two weeks time. The two had split after a red-hot 2002 season as Mirnyi was keen on focussing more on his singles career. Besides winning two titles last year including the US Open, Bhupathi and Mirnyi made four finals as well. Despite splitting with Mahesh to concentrate on singles, Max continued playing doubles this year. Mahesh made that point and prevailed upon Max to resume their partnership, Enrico Piperno informed The Telegraph. [Interestingly, Bhupathi and Mirnyi fired against each other at the Miami ATP meet in the first round Sunday, add agencies. The Indian and his British partner Tim Henman, however, lost to seventh seeds Mirnyi and Swiss Roger Federer 6-4, 3-6, 4-6. Leander Paes and his Czech partner David Rikl, though, scraped through Czech Republics Petr Pala and German David Prisnosil 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7/5) in Round I.] From April, though, Bhupathi and Mirnyi will only be on the same side of the doubles court. They have committed to play together all big events including the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open for the rest of the year, said Piperno who will rejoin Bhupathi after doing his Fed Cup captains duties next month. Bhupathi had to seek a change after his partnership with Australian Joshua Eagle flopped. Both are right-court players and Joshua didnt want to shift Mahesh tried playing on the left court but it didnt work out, explained Piperno.  Copyright

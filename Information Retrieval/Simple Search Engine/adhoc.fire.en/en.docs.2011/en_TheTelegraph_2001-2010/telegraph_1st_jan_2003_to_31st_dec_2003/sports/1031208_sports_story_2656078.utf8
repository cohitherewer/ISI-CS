 Humpy in sole lead
Kozhikode: Grandmaster Koneru Humpy shot into sole lead with a clinical victory over M. Srinivas Rao in the sixth round of the 41st National A Chess Championship here Sunday. Humpy took her tally to five and is now trailed by GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly and R. B. Ramesh, both on 4.5. GM Dibyendu Barua is on four with Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury. A pack of five  Abhijit Kunte, Sandipan Chanda, Neelotpal Das, Pravin Thipsay and Suvrajit Saha share the next spot with 3.5 each. Humpy, playing black, was at her best as Rao chose the Grunfeld Defence. He lost a pawn in tactical skirmish and eventually gave up. After a rather disastrous start, top seed GM P. Harikrishna scored his second victory on the trot, outclassing double GM norm holder Tejas Bakre.  (PTI)  Copyright

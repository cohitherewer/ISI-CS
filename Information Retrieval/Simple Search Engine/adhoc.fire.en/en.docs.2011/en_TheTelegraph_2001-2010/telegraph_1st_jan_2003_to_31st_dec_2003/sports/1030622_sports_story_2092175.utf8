 Mike Tyson arrested after day-break brawl
 Mike Tyson New York, June 21 (Reuters): Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson was arrested after an early morning brawl with two men at a Brooklyn hotel Saturday and charged with assault and disorderly conduct, police said. Tyson, the self-described baddest man on the planet, suffered cuts to the hands and was treated at the scene, police said. The boxer became enmeshed in a 5.30am dispute with two men and a woman at the Marriott hotel where he was a guest. A fight erupted and the two men, whom police would not identify, picked up an object in the hotels lobby and menaced Tyson with it, a police spokeswoman said. The two men were charged with menacing and disorderly conduct. One of the men and the woman were taken to Bellevue Hospital for unknown injuries, police said. And recently, in a television interview, Tyson even said that the burden of being labelled a convicted rapist makes him want to do it now. I just hate her (Desiree Washington) guts. She put me in that state, where I dont know, Tyson said. I really wish I did now. But now I really do want to rape her.  Copyright

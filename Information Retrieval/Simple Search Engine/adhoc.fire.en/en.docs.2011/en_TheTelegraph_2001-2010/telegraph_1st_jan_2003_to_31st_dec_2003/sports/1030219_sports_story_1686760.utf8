The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Lankans eye Super Six slot
Paarl: Sri Lanka captain Sanath Jayasuriya might be reflecting on what a difference two months makes as he plots his teams final push towards the World Cup Super Sixes, when they play rank outsiders Canada at the BoE Park here on Wednesday. In December, Sri Lanka departed South Africa after a disastrous tour. They were demolished in two Tests and beaten 4-1 in the ODIs. Their final ignominy came when they were trounced by the South Africa A. But it has been a different Sri Lanka, and especially a rejuvenated Jayasuriya, who have been pacesetters in the World Cup. The Islanders have won both their matches  beating New Zealand and Bangladesh  and Jayasuriya, whose poor personal performances were a factor in their defeats on the earlier tour, has been in top form, hitting 120 against New Zealand and 55 not out against Bangladesh. TEAMS Sri Lanka (from): Sanath Jayasuriya (captain), Maravan Atapattu, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Aravinda De Silva, Russel Arnold, Jehan Mubarak, Avishka Gunawardena, Hashan Tillekeratne, Muttiah Muralidharan, Chaminda Vaas, Dilhara Fernando, Prabath Nissanka, Charitha Buddhika. Canada (from): Joseph Harris (captain), Ashish Bagai, Ian Billcliff, Desmond Chumney, Austin Codrington, John Davison, Nicholas De Groot, Nicholas Ifil, Davis Joseph, Ishwar Maraj, Ashish Patel, Abdool Samad, Fazil Sattaur, Barry Seebaran, Sanjayan Thuraisingam.

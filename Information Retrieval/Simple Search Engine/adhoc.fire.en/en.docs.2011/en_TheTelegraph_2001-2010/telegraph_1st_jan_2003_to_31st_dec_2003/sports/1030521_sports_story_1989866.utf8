The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bond may be out for 4 months
  Bond Wellington: Shane Bond has a probable stress fracture in his spine which will prevent the fast bowler taking up his contract with English County Warwickshire, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said on Tuesday.NZC said it was too early to comment on the time frame for his recovery but the Kiwi paceman said he could be out for up to four months.It is going to mean a three to four-month stand down from bowling, Bond said. Its a fairly serious injury. The continual pounding away when Im bowling has caused a little crack in the spine.The injury first flared during the one-day International against Pakistan in Dambulla on May 11, when he was able to bowl only five overs. It then cut short Bonds involvement in the current triangular one-day series.Once I cooled down after my spell I really struggled to move and its been like that since, said Bond.Bond said he was disappointed to miss the opportunity to play for Warwickshire. I am fairly philosophical about it though. I look at it as if I never signed that contract (one-season deal for the county) and perhaps that opportunity will arise later on. He said he would reassess his bowling action and training methods. I am a fast bowler and it is extremely tough on the body. There are days you wake up stiff but thats the role I have in the team. I offer the team something different and I have to continue bowling in the same way.Bond has proved a potent weapon in the New Zealand bowling attack since making his debut in the 2001-02 season.He has taken 43 Test wickets and 51 one-day wickets, including a New Zealand record six for 23 against Australia in the World Cup in March.Bond, 27, who had a short spell with Warwickshire last season, was due to return at the end of this month for a second stint with the club.

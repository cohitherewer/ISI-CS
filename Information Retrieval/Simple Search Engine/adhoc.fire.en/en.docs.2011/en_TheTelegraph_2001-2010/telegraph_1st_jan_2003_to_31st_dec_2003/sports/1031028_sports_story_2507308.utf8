 Zimbabwe optimistic
Harare: Zimbabwe were optimistic of performing competitively in next months home series against the West Indies even though they were comprehensively beaten during their tour of Australia, officials said on Monday. Zimbabwe Cricket Union president Peter Chingoka believes the team will perform well against the West Indies who arrived here on Monday for a tour of two Test matches and five one-day Internationals. In Australia, even without the injured Grant Flower in the side, we managed to put up a couple of reasonable performances, especially at Sydney, Chingoka said, referring to Zimbabwes first innings total of 308 in the second Test in Sydney. With Zimbabwe trying to rebuild a top flight team following retirements of Andy Flower, Henry Olonga, Guy Whittall and Alistair Campbell, Chingoka added that Zimbabwe cricket was heading in the right direction.

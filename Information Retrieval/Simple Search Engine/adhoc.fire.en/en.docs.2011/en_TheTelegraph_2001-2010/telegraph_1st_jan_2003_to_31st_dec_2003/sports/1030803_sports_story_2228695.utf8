The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Jaffers double ton ensures draw 
 Jaffer London, Aug. 2 (PTI): A brilliant 218 by opener Wasim Jaffer and an unbeaten 108 by left-hander Sridharan Sriram helped India A snatch a draw in their four-day match against Warwickshire at Edgbaston on Saturday. Following on and still 286 run in arrears when they went to bat on the final morning, India A finished with 449 for the loss of just two wickets before declaring their second innings. Sriram and his Tamil Nadu teammate Hemang Badani (14) were the not out batsmen. The draw meant the visitors remained unconquered in their 40-day trip. Resuming at 70 for no loss, the Indians were given a solid platform by the opening pair of captain Shiv Sundar Das and Jaffer, who put on 151 runs. Das eventually fell to Kenyan leg-spinner Collins Obuya after having spent 150 minutes at wicket for his 65. But Jaffer continued with his counterattack. His first hundred was scored off 146 balls, and the second came in even quicker time.  Copyright

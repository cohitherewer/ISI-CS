 Bronchitis leaves Radcliffe doubtful
 Radcliffe has until August 11 to prove that she is fit to run in Paris London: Britains Paula Radcliffe could miss next months IAAF World Championships in Paris because of bronchitis. Radcliffe, who has not run since her world record-breaking effort in the London Marathon, had planned to make the 10,000m in Paris her first race of the summer. But the illness means Radcliffe has been forced to miss a further nine days of training on top of the time she took off to recover from an earlier leg problem. Her husband and manager Gary Lough told the Daily Telegraph: Paula was back in training after getting over the injury when she picked up bronchitis. When youre training at the level Paula is, you are susceptible to all sorts of bugs. If the injury was all she had to worry about it would have been OK. But to be hit by two things at this stage means the circumstances have changed. We have to be realistic and take one day at a time. Everything is up in the air. No decisions have been made and it looks as if well have to wait until the last possible moment before we commit to Paris. Radcliffe had been training at altitude in the French Pyrenees in the hope of beginning her track season at Londons Super League meeting at Crystal Palace on August 8. She withdrew from that meeting after getting injured last month and had been focussing solely on the Paris 10,000m for which she was the favourite. She has until August 11 to prove to the British selectors that she is fit to run in Paris. The World Championships run from August 23 to 31.  (AFP)  Copyright

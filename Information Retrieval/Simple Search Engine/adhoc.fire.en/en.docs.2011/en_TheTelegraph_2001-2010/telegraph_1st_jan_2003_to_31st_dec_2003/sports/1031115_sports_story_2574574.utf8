 Pak board cracks whip
Islamabad: Cracking the whip following the war of words between chief selector, coach and captain over the selection of probables, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday asked them to stop the public feud or pack their bags. PCB took a serious view of the officials spat as well as speedster Shoaib Akhtars violation of Code of Conduct. I am disappointed with a series of statements issued by the team officials and the chief selector. I am sad that such big names of cricket representing a responsible organisation have indulged in mud-slinging, PCB chairman Lt Gen. Tauqir Zia said. Gen. Zia was referring to the public spat between Aamer Sohail on one hand and Javed Miandad and Inzamam-ul Haq on the other about the selection of probables to play New Zealand at home beginning November 20. The PCB chief met chief selector Sohail, coach Miandad, skipper Inzamam and Akhtar and warned them of severe consequences if they violated the Code of Conduct and continued the feud in public. I have met all three and have conveyed my disappointment to them. I have warned them that the PCB will not tolerate any further statements from them against each other. They have also been informed that the PCB will be forced to ask them to pack their bags and go home if any further statements are attributed to them, Gen. Zia said. In view of the warning the PCB considers this case as closed and would not make any further statements on this issue, a PCB spokesman said. Shoaib was reprimanded for criticising the PCB and ICC in recent interviews. Shoaib has apologised to the PCB for the remarks. He has been told to refrain from statements that are against the ICC and PCB policies, the spokesman said. But Shoaib has invited further trouble after criticising the ICC for not being consistent while punishing players for indiscipline. (PTI)  Copyright

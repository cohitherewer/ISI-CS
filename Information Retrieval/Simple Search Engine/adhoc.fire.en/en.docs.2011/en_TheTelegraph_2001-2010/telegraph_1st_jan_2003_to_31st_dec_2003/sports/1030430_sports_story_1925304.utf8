The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CESC edge past FCI
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: CESC won a rough tie against FCI with a last-minute strike at the Mohun Bagan ground Tuesday. The defending BHA League first division group A champions have now won seven of their eight matches to be placed second. Calcutta Customs are on top, with an all-win record in seven games. CESC were the aggressors in the first session, creating numerous openings only to falter in the striking zone. FCI had the better of exchanges after the change of ends, with Sudhir Minz and Gurdhyan Singh testing the CESC defence from time to time. The action-packed second half saw FCIs Pintoo Debnath getting a nasty cut on his hand from a full-blooded hit. And then Gurdhyan was temporarily marched out for abusing and charging at umpire Khalid Hussain in protest against a decision of his. With less than a minute to go, Christopher Thomas capitalised on some sloppy defending to find Sunil Soren who pushed the ball in unchallenged. Calcutta Port Trust overcame Eastern Railway SA 3-0 thanks to a Manoj Das brace and one from Yusuf Bhengra.  Copyright

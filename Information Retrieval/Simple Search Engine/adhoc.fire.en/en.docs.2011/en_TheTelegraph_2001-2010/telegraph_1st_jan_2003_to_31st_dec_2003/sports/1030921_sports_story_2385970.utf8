 Upper hand for Mumbai
 Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly follow the path of the ball miscued by the Little Master on Day 3 of the Irani Trophy tie in Chennai on Saturday. V.V.S. Laxman grassed the skier and Tendulkar went on to make 50. (AFP) Chennai, Sept. 20 (PTI): Mumbai scalped two quick wickets on Saturday to take the drivers seat against Rest of India at the end of the third day of the Irani Trophy tie being played here. After being bowled out for 244 in their second essay, with an overall lead of 339, Mumbais bowlers struck to leave Rest of India at 55 for two at stumps. Rahul Dravid (16) and L. Balaji (0) were at the crease after the dismissal of Virender Sehwag (36) and Sanjay Bangar (1). Dravid and Sehwag built up a 50-run partnership for the second wicket, but the latter could not sustain the momentum and departed, driving straight to Ramesh Powar at covers off Robin Morris. Earlier, Mumbai were bowled out for 244 just after tea with Harbhajan Singh claiming four for 79. Balaji and Anil Kumble, with two wickets apiece, played the support cast to perfection. For Mumbai, Powar top-scored with 57 while Sachin Tendulkar and leg-spinner Sairaj Bahutule chipped in with 50 and 36, respectively.  Powar and Agarkar (22) put on 43 runs for the eighth wicket in 11 overs. Mumbai had a setback after lunch as Harbhajan and Zaheer dismissed Nishit Shetty and Tendulkar for the addition of only six runs. Sachin failed to keep his flick off Zaheer down and was caught by Balaji at square leg. Earlier, Laxman had grassed an easy chance off Sachin on seven, of the bowling of Harbhajan, which helped Mumbai steady the ship after losing two quick wickets.  Copyright

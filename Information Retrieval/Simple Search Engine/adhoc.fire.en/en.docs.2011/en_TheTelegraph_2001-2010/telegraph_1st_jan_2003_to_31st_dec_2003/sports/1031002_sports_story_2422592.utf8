The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Martyn recalled
Sydney: Australia recalled Damien Martyn for next weeks first Test against Zimbabwe. Out goes Martyn Love despite scoring a ton in the last Test. Martyn has not played a Test for Australia since January after he broke his index finger just before the World Cup final in March. He missed this years tour of the West Indies and also the two-Test series with Bangladesh but played in the one-dayers and recently proved his fitness with a double-century for Yorkshire in the County Championship. I guess its a sense of relief really because such is the depth in Australian cricket that as soon as you relinquish your position for injury or whatever reason, another player can just as easily take your spot, Martyn said. Martyns return forced the selectors to drop Love even though the Queenslander scored 100 not out in his previous Test innings against Bangaldesh. Love joined Paul Sheahan, John Benaud and Dirk Wellham to be dropped after making hundreds.

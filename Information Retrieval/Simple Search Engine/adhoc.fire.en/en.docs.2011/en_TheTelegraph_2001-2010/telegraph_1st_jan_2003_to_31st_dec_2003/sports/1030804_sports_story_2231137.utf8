 ASEAN meet fixing charge 
Hanoi: A player of Vietnams top football team Hoang Anh (HAGL) has accused two of his teammates of trying to fix a match against Indonesias Persita Tangerang in the recently concluded ASEAN Club Championship, according to a report published in the Thanh Nien (Youth) newspaper on Sunday. Midfielder Nguyen Manh Dung said Nguyen Viet Thang and Luong Trung Tuan had let their teammates know they could earn $5,000 each if Persita won the July 14 match by a goal, the paper said. The Indonesian team won the match 2-1 before losing to eventual champions East Bengal 1-2 in the quarter finals. Hoang Anh is Vietnams richest club and V-League champion in 2003. Thang had allegedly made the offer the day before the match. The national sports committee has demanded that the ministry of public security investigate the allegation.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Leander arriving today 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Leander Paes  Calcutta: Leander Paes  is coming to the city on Tuesday. The citys tennis fraternity had been waiting to welcome their favourite son for the first time since a brain lesion laid him low in mid-August. Having flown in to Mumbai from Orlando three weeks ago, the 30-year-old star had been contemplating a visit to his Beckbagan roots, only to be put off by a hectic schedule. Finally, he has managed to squeeze out time. Ill be in Calcutta on Friday evening just couldnt manage to come earlier, Paes informed The Telegraph from Goa where he is busy with a commercial shoot. On Sunday, he was in Belgaum to give away the prizes at the ATP Challenger. May not be back to his globe-trotting schedule yet, but India-darshan seems to be on in full swing. It will be a short visit, as he plans to fly back on Friday to spend Diwali in Mumbai. A dash to Hyderabad for the Afro-Asian Games  again, on Chandrababu Naidus request  will follow. Ill also have to get another MRI done end of this month and that will kind of tell me when I can resume my tennis, Paes said.  Copyright

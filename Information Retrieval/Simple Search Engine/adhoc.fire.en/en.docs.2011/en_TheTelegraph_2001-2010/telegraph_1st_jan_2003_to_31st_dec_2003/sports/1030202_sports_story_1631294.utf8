The Telegraph - Calcutta
 PCA seeks access to report
 London, Feb. 1 (Reuters): Englands cricketers association is to press again for sight of the Kroll Report which the ICC used as the basis of Thursdays decision to go ahead with six World Cup matches in Zimbabwe. The Professional Cricketers Association (PCA) said after a teleconference on Saturday they had been told that the report would not be made available to players representatives. However, a meeting could be arranged between representatives and the reports authors in Cape Town next week. A PCA statement said: This is an unacceptable position. The PCA have been contacted by a member of the media who has had access to the Kroll Report which has led to serious concerns. Without doubt there is an element of risk as the Kroll Report confirmed extensive disruptions of the matches are planned by elements in the opposition.  Copyright

 Ronaldinho deal nearly through, says Ferguson 
Manchester: Manchester United are close to completing a deal for Brazilian international Ronaldinho, manager Alex Ferguson said on Tuesday. United have been involved in lengthy negotiations with Paris St Germain and are reported to have offered the French first division club up to  20 million for the 23-year-old World Cup winner. We are pursuing the Ronaldinho thing very intensely now. Its getting to that stage where its maybe just about there, Ferguson told a news conference on Tuesday. We dont want to say its certain until it actually is certain, but were very close. Ronaldinho has also been linked with Real Madrid and Barcelona but the Brazilian has said he is keen to join the Premier League champions. Ferguson said it would be the right move for the player. I think we have plenty to offer here. This is one stadium where there is full capacity every week. I dont want to be counting my chickens. But the signs are okay. We just want to get that seal on it and then we can talk about it more openly. (Reuters)  Copyright

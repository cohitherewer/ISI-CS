I want to organise a match between the 1998 French Bleus and Olympique Marseille in Marseille, the Real Madrid and France playmaker told LEquipe on Thursday.

Its my parents country of birth, said Zidane, born and raised in Marseille.				 																																	Zidane told LEquipe the date of a possible game had not yet been set.Well think about it.

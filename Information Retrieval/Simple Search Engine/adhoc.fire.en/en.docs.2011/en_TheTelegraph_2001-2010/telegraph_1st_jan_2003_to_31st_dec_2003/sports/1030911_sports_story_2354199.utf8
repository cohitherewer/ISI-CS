The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bhutia shines in Perak win
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: Perak FC of Ipoh, Malaysia, are in fine fettle, winning their home quarter final match of the Association Cup 2-0 versus Serawak on Wednesday. And Indias Bhaichung Bhutia was the star, booting home the first goal in the 25th minute. Eustri rounded off the tally for the Malaysian league champions. Perak now await the away match. Bhaichung told The Telegraph over phone from Ipoh that he was enjoying his stay with this club and that a decent-sized fan-following has grown, despite this being a quite little city, quite unlike the big Kuala Lumpur (two and-a-half hours from here), he said. He said the media keeps giving him ample support and that TV 3, the channel which is televising these matches (though not live, but as highlights) has interviewed me and that has been a boost. Bhaichung has so far scored two goals for Perak and he said he was very happy with his performance.  Copyright

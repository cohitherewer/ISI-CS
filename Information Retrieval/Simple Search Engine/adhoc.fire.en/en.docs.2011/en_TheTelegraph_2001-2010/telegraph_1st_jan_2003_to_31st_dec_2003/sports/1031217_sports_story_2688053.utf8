The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England upbeat 
		 Vaughan feels Sri Lanka are susceptible  to pressureColombo: England go into the third and deciding Test in a buoyant mood despite having been dominated by their Sri Lankan opponents in the first two matches. The home team, meanwhile, know they will have to control their sense of frustration and injustice after failing to turn that superiority into a victory during a tense and ill-tempered series. The teams moods have been reflected in the words of their coaches. Having drawn two now, the pressure they must be under for not winning one of those games makes us feel pretty confident. We definitely feel we have momentum, England coach Duncan Fletcher said. England were one wicket away from defeat in the first Test but clung on as one lbw decision after another went in their favour. In Kandy they batted out 140 overs, losing seven wickets, to draw again despite the close attentions of Muttiah Muralitharan and a tight net of brilliant and excitable close fielders.  Sri Lanka coach John Dyson said  he was surprised at the tourists refusal to chase their  368-run target in Kandy after what he described as a very  brave declaration. We have been on top of those games  and been frustrated at times but these games test your patience  and test your levels of coping with frustrations, Dyson  said. The boys will have to maintain their concentration,  their focus and their patience.(Reuters)  Copyright

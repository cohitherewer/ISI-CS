The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sania pushed down to No. 3
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The International Tennis Federation (ITF) altered the junior girls doubles rankings twice in two days, thus denying Sania Mirza her deserved No. 1 spot. Having listed her as world No. 1 at the start of this week, the ITF rankings committee brought her down two rungs within 24 hours. The contentious Grand Slam bonus points once again came into play and by refusing to grant those extra points for winning the Wimbledon girls doubles title, the ITF was back to square one. Interestingly, Sania was listed as No. 4 the day after Wimbledon fortnight got over. The reduced draw in the girls doubles event at the Championships was apparently the reason why the full quota of points wasnt awarded to champions Sania and Russian partner Alisa Kleybanova. They seemed to have rectified that anomaly this week, but The AITA is not putting in a formal protest. Its a matter of ITF rules their juniors committee will meet sometime in September-October to examine the issue, AITA secretary Anil Khanna told The Telegraph on Wednesday night. Somebody may have made a mistake somewhere, but I am sure ITF will sort it out. Sania is not losing sleep over ITFs numbers game, she has more compelling matters to attend to. But deep inside, she must be wishing AITA was more sensitive to players sentiments.  Copyright

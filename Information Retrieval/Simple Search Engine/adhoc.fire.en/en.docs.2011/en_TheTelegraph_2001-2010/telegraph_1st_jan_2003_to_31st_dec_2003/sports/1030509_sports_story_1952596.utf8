 Bangalore, Mohali likely venues 
Mumbai: Bangalore and Mohali would be the likely venues for the two-Test series against New Zealand during their tour of India in September-October. The Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary S.K. Nair said here on Thursday that the fixtures committee was expected to meet by the end of this month to finalise the dates and venues, but on rotation basis Bangalore and Mohali are the likely venues. The Indians will also play a triangular one-day series with New Zealand and Australia. The tri-series will involve ten matches including the final. The dates and venues are yet to be decided, he said. Meanwhile, the selection committee chaired by Brijesh Patel will meet in Bangalore on May 19 to pick the India A team for its 75-day tour of England, Nair said. (PTI)  Copyright

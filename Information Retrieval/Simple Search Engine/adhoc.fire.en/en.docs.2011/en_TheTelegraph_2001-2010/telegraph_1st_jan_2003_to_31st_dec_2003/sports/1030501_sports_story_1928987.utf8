The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bangla out to justify status
 Graeme Smith feels his boys are gelling as a team Dhaka: Bangladesh attempt to justify their Test status yet again Thursday when they take on South Africa in the second Test at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The hosts lost by an innings and 60 runs in the first Test in Chittagong, their 17th loss in 18 matches since gaining Test status three years ago. The only draw they have salvaged so far has been against Zimbabwe in a truncated tie two seasons ago. Our batsmen need to apply themselves better if we are to hope to put up resistance in any Test, said captain Khaled Mahmud, who took over as captain earlier this month. Mahmuds side failed to win a match in a triangular series also featuring India and his first Test at the helm also proved a forgettable outing with a crushing defeat. South African captain Graeme Smith too is new at the helm, but things have been much different for his new-look side. The players are getting to know their roles and I am continuing to learn about captaining an international side, said Smith, who saw some exceptional individual efforts from his players in the first Test. Bangladesh are likely to make one change from the side that played in the last match, bringing in Mohammed Rafique for other Monjural Islam. TEAMS South Africa (from): Graeme Smith (capt.), Mark Boucher, Hershelle Gibbs, Boeta Dippenaar, Shaun Pollock, Neil McKenzie, Paul Adams, Alan Dawson, Andrew Hall, Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson, Jacques Rudolph, Charl Willoughby.

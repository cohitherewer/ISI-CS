The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Bernard upsets Tim
	 - US CHAMPIONSHIPS  Bernard Williams edged out Tim Montgomery to win the 100m in 10.11 seconds. The world champion finished second in 10.15 Palo Alto (California), June 21 (Reuters): Bernard Williams upset world record holder Tim Montgomery to claim a stunning win in the mens 100 metres at the US championships Friday. Montgomery struggled, stumbling and touching the track with his hands, but recovered to roar back and finish second in 10.15 seconds. Williams, the world championship bronze medallist, won in 10.11 seconds. Jon Drummond was third in 10.18. The trio, plus reigning world champion Maurice Greene who had a bye, will represent the US at the world championships in Paris in August. I lost the battle but maybe I can still win the war, Montgomery said. I fell, touched the track with my hands, got up and came in second. I just closed my eyes and ran. Williams, who finished behind Greene and Montgomery in the 2001 Edmonton world championships, said he hoped to do better in Paris. This was one of my best starts, he said. I reacted well (to the starters gun) and made a good transition. It means a lot being the American champ. I was kind of hungry. Kelli White was first in the womens 100m, clocking the fastest time in the world this year, 10.93 seconds, despite a headwind of 1.1m per second. Torri Edwards came second in 11.13 and Gail Devers, the 1992 and 1996 Olympic champion, won a photo finish for third in 11.16 seconds. My start was awesome, said the 26-year-old White, who nine years ago survived a knife attack that required more than 300 stitches. I am excited with how fast I went into this wind. World indoor champion Dwight Phillips defeated Walter Davis by virtue of a better second effort to win the mens long jump. Both leapt 8.24m but Phillips had another jump of 8.21 while Davis fouled out at his only other attempt.  Copyright

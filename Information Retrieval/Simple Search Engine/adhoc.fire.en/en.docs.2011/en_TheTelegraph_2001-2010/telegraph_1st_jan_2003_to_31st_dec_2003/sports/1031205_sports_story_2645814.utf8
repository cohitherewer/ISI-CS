The Telegraph - Calcutta
 We have to keep fighting: Dravid
Brisbane: Team India vice-captain Rahul Dravid on Thursday conceded that India had been pushed on the backfoot after failing to exploit helpful conditions and said the team would have to do much better on Friday to bounce back into the first Test against Australia. We definitely are on the backfoot. It was a tough day. Australians always speak about doing well on the first session and first day of the Test series and they enjoyed a huge day, Dravid said after Australia had piled on 262 for two on a rain-truncated first days play. We probably did not bowl as well as we should have. But it has been harsh really. They could have bowled in better areas. But you have got to give credit to the Aussies. It was more of a case of they batting well than we bowling poorly. Dravid said it was important for India to pick wickets after having asked the Aussies to bat first in overcast conditions. Having chosen to bowl, the onus was on us. But they batted very well... We now got to keep fighting and do better tomorrow. We expect tough days on these tours but we need to bounce back .  Meanwhile, Langer believes his team have struck a major psychological blow by taking the honours on the opening day. We always aim to win the first day of the series and I think we did that, Langer said. They had very good conditions but we came away from it having lost only two wickets so I think it was a huge day for us. Langer said Australia captain Steve Waugh told his players he planned to bat first if he won the toss, even though the pitch looked menacing. Weve learnt our lessons at the Gabba. If you can get through those first 20 overs or so when its really tough then you can really set up the game, Langer said. It was very hard out there, as hard as Ive ever seen it, but it started to play okay as long as you watched the ball carefully.  (AGENCIES)  Copyright

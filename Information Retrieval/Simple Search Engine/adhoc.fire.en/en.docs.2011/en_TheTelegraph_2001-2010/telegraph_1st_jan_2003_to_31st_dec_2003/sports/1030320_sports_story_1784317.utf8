Bengal  Real, Juventus make quarters 
 Ronaldo after scoring for Real Madrid against Lokomotiv Moscow in their Champions League match Tuesday. (Reuters) London: European champions Real Madrid and twice winners Juventus clinched their places in the last eight of the Champions League on Tuesday as they joined already-qualified Manchester United, Barcelona and AC Milan. Real secured their spot when they won 1-0 over Lokomotiv in Moscow to finish second in Group C behind AC Milan. Juventus also reached the last eight despite losing 1-2 to a stoppage time goal in Basel. Reals first win in nine visits to Russia came thanks to a 35th minute goal from Ronaldo and meant Real finished second behind Milan even though Borussia Dortmund won 1-0 at Milan. Milan topped the group with 12 points, Real finished on 11, Dortmund on 10 and Lokomotiv with just one. Dortmunds elimination means that for the first time since the 1956-57 season there is no German representative in the last eight of a European competition. Basel needed to beat Juventus 4-0 or better to climb into second spot but that never looked likely after Alessio Tacchinardi put Juventus ahead on 10 minutes. Mario Cantaluppi equalised for Basel seven minutes before the break and Christian Gimenez scored their winner two minutes into stoppage time. United clinched their place in the last eight a month ago and won the group by five points despite their young, largely reserve side, losing 0-2 at Deportivo La Coruna in their final match. United topped the group with 13 points followed by Juventus, who took second place because of their better results against the other two teams on seven points  Deportivo and Basel.

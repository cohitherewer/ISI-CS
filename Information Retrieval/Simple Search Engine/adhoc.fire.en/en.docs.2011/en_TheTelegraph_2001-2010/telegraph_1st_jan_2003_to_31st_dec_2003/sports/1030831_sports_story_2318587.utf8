 Bedi criticises BCCI
New Delhi, Aug. 30 (PTI): Bishan Singh Bedi criticised the BCCI for ignoring Indian coaches and said too much reliance on the laptop will not help the players. Unhappy with the increasing role of foreign personnel, Bedi said, we have enough talent but no one wants to make full use of the expertise available within our country. Why shouldnt we play the game the Indian way, the way Col C.K. Nayudu, Vijay Hazare, Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar played it? he asked. He is not averse to picking up good points from other countries, but Bedi isnt in favour of blindly following any one system.  Copyright

 Chandu Sarvate passes away
Indore: Former India player and national selector Chandu Sarvate died this evening in a hospital, his family said. Sarvate, who was 83, is survived by wife and a daughter. He played nine Tests between 1946 and 1952. In 1946, while playing for India against Surrey, Sarvate added 249 with Shute Banerjee for the last wicket, a record yet to be broken. It was the only occasion when both No. 10 and 11 batsmen scored centuries. In the Melbourne Test against Australia in 1948, Sarvate with Vinoo Mankad bravely faced Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller to add 124 runs. A finger-print expert by profession, Sarvate was a selector of Indias 1983 World Cup winning team. (PTI)  Copyright

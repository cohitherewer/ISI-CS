 Tim to give Rome a miss
Durham (North Carolina): Tim Montgomery, the 100m world record holder, will miss Fridays Golden League meeting in Rome to spend more time in America with his partner, triple Olympic champion Marion Jones, and their new son. Tim has not decided when he will return, said his agent Charlie Wells, who confirmed Montgomery would not be in Rome after he missed the Lausanne Grand Prix and Paris Golden League meet following the birth of his son Tim on June 29.

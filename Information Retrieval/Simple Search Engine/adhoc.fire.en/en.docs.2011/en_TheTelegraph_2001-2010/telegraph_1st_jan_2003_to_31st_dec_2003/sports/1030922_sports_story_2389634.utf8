The Telegraph - Calcutta
 India off to a great start
 Indias Dinesh Nayak tries to snatch the ball from Chinas Qiao Yuan Dan in the Asia Cup meet in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday Kuala Lumpur: India scored a 5-1 victory over China in their opening match of the sixth Asia Cup hockey competition here on Sunday. Good ball possession and some excellent passing saw India score through defender Dilip Tirkey (5th, 37th) and Prabhjot Singh (41st, 59th). Gagan Ajit Singh was the other scorer for India, sounding the board in the 20th minute. For China, Song Yi scored the consolation goal in the 46th minute. The win helped India maintain a clean slate against China. India have won all the eight matches played between the two sides so far. Though India coach Rajinder Singh was satisfied with the result, he said his boys should have done better and won by a bigger margin. We gave a couple of chances to the Chinese. Our players especially Dhanraj Pillay were marked tightly, the coach said. Earlier in the day, Kashif Jawaid scored a hattrick as Pakistan started with a bang, thrashing a hapless Bangladesh 8-0 in a pool B match. Jawad scored in the 21st, 46th and 61st minutes while penalty corner expert Sohail Abbas struck a brace (26th, 62nd). Mudassar Ali (9th), captain Nadeem Ahmed (36th) and Rehan Butt (64th) heaped more misery on a mediocre Bangladesh side. The best match of the day was between hosts Malaysia and defending champions South Korea in pool A. Malaysia played extremely well t o hold the Asian Games champions to a 1-1 draw. Korea went ahead in the third minute through Lee Jung Jung while Malaysia equalised through Chua Boon Huat three minutes before halftime. In another group A match, Japan thrashed Hong Kong 7-3. Japan scored through Kenichi Katayama (40th, 56th), Ryu Ji Furusato (61st, 68th), Akira Takahashi (12th), Nao Hiko Tobita (50th) and Kazayuki Ozawa (64th). For Hong Kong, Pritpal Singh Chima (20th), Ali Akbar (51st) and Arif Ali (6 9th) sounded the board. (PTI)  Copyright

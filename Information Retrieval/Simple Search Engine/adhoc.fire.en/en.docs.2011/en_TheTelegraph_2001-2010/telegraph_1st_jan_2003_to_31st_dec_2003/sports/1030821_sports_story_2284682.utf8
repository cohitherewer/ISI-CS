The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Thursday, August 21, 2003  Supreme Treasure may strike 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL				 										Mysore: Thursdays main event, the Delhi Race Club Trophy for horses rated 20 and 35, is a split affair. The upper division of the trophy seems to be a straight contest between Striesand and Supreme Treasure. But the latter, a Robert Foley-trainee, holds the advantage, and thus may score. 				 										The lower division, however, looks to be in the safe keeping of the Jaggy Dhariwal-trained Conqueress who has performed well during the summer season. Grey Ridge and Acquaintance seem to be her main rivals but in the hands of Pesi Shroff Conqueress may strike.				 										SELECTIONS				 										2.15 pm: Anonyme 1. Odysseus 2.

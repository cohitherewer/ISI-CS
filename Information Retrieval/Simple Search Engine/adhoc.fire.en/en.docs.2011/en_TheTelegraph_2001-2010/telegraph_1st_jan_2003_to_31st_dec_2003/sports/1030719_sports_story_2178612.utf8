The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Scripting the winning formula
- Top-notch Australian sports psychologist wasnt eclipsed by legendary compatriots Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee BY LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Sourav Ganguly has been bowled over by Sandy Gordon Calcutta: With Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee among the speakers at the recent MRF Pace Foundation coaches seminar, in Chennai, only an outstanding presentation would have made the invitees really notice Sandy Gordon.As it turned out, the most-in-demand sports psychologist did enough to ensure his legendary compatriots didnt monopolise the limelight.Indeed, if implemented, the Perth-based Gordons presentation  a copy of which is with The Telegraph  should lay the foundations of an appreciable change in the coaches approach towards such an important aspect: Mental toughness.Gordon, it may be recalled, interacted with Team India on the eve of our 2003 World Cup campaign, in Paarl. In fact, it was at his suggestion that Sourav Ganguly and Co. authored a theme  Now or Never  for the tournament.That interaction  both collective and one-to-one  was so fruitful that coach John Wright has initiated a move for Gordons services during Team Indias tour of Australia later this year.Sourav, of course, is just as keen. Gordon, by the way, was contracted to Cricket Australia (then the Australian Cricket Board) during Indias last trip Down Under  in 1999-2000.Incidentally, during his presentation (where he called for setting team and individual goals) in Chennai, Gordon listed what goes into a team performing at its peak. He focussed on the individual as well. Here goes:(a) For teams: Patience (accepting results), pressure (batting, bowling and fielding), partnerships (batting and bowling), present focus (ball-to-ball) and positive mental momentum. If youre sincerely committed to executing a team game plan, you will be in control.(b) For individuals: Trust (back yourself and enjoy), take positive risks (be definite and play to win), task awareness (constantly ask yourself what you have to do) and present focus (totally absorb self in the moment and task at hand).A winning formula, if ever there was one.

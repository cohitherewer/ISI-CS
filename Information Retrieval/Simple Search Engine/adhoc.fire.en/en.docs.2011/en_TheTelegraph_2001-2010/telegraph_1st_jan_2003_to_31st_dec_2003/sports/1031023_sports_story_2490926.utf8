The Telegraph - Calcutta
 It will take much more than a brain lesion to knock me down
	 - Doctor against my playing in Houston: leander Paes  BY AMITAVA DAS GUPTA  Leander Paes with pet Nipper on arrival at his Beckbagan residence on Wednesday morning as Dr Vece Paes and Julie watch admiringly. Picture by Pabitra Das Calcutta: From the day Leander Paes brain cyst was identified as a relatively safe parasitic infection, he had been toying with the idea of playing at least the season-ending Houston Masters Doubles championship in the second week of November. But, as the articulate Olympic medallist himself acknowledges, you never stop learning in life. And he has just learnt that playing the Houston meet is all but ruled out. Dr Bhim Singhal, the head of neurology department, Bombay Hospital, and the man who played a key role in Leanders treatment, doesnt want the tennis star to take chances and rush his return. Leander spoke to The Telegraph, on the way from the airport as well as at his residence, on the Houston issue and plans for 2004.  Following are excerpts  Q Its been two  months since a parasitic infection was diagnosed as the  cause for your brain lesion. How do you assess your recovery?  A I had to go through a  10-day medication course, thereafter I was advised rest.  I have resumed biking, swimming, running and light weight  training, but I have no clue as to when I will be given  the go-ahead to play tennis. Ill have the next MRI done  just after Diwali and that will tell us whether the swelling  has been completely eradicated.  Youve been travelling a lot  these last few days after coming to India. Arent you feeling  the strain?  There was a lot of pending work which Im trying to  get out of the way. But, yes, I do need to slow down a bit  as I realised three days ago when I had fever. Physically  Im not feeling much discomfort, but I can make out I am  short of my normal energy level. I had put on 18 pounds  but in the last few weeks have shed 12 of those. I am gradually  getting back to peak fitness.  What is Dr Bhim Singhals opinion  on your return to tennis?  He feels its still too early to get back on court.  It may be just a parasitic infection, but the doctors dont  want the brain to wobble. And if I am playing tennis, I  will be lunging and diving around the court and the brain  will wobble. Thats why he feels I shouldnt take chances  unless I am cent per cent cured.  That practically rules out  your playing the Masters Doubles meet in Houston, doesnt  it?  You can say that. Dr Singhal is against the idea,  even if next weeks scan shows the swelling has subsided  100 per cent. But Ill still wait for that report...  Not playing Houston will be  quite a letdown, you were after all very keen  Yeah, I was very eager to play in Houston. I think  it was a fantastic achievement to qualify for the year-ending  championships in our first year together and, that too,  after missing the better part of the seasons second half.  It would have given a great boost to our confidence for  next years campaign. More importantly, I have some responsibilities  towards my partner David (Rikl). Playing the Masters is  not only a matter of prestige, it also ensures all qualifiers  a handsome prize-money. I wanted to play for David.  Is he aware thats very unlikely  to happen?  Yeah, he knows my exact position. Davids been very  supportive and extremely understanding. Hes told me not  to hasten my return to tennis and do whatevers best for  my health. I am really fortunate to have found a partner  like him.  How confident are you of getting  back to what you do best at the start of next season?  You all know Im a fighter and it will take much more  than a brain lesion to knock me down. Im hoping to get  back in action in January, but Im keeping fingers crossed.  Will you and Rikl be playing  together next year?  He was reluctant to continue tennis after this season,  but now he has more or less changed his mind. Next year,  mind you, will be different because its the Olympic year.  For example, I would be wanting to play with Mahesh (Bhupathi)  for a few weeks before the Athens Games. David and I will  have to sit down and chalk out our itinerary carefully.  Are you looking forward to  the opening ceremony of the Afro-Asian Games?  Yes, indeed. Its a prestigious  event for India and you know how I feel when it comes to  my country. I am not in a position to participate, but Ill  make sure Im there to cheer the athletes and encourage  all those who have put together this mega show. I have even  convinced Mahima (Chaudhary) to do a dance sequence based  on my favourite song I love my India  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dual century blast buries Australia
 - Gilchrist not enough vs Sachin-Laxman
 FROM INDRANIL MAJUMDAR INDIA 283/5 (50 ovs) AUSTRALIA 246/9  (50 ovs) MoM: Sachin Tendulkar Yuvraj Singh scored  a rapid 44  Gwalior: The Indian huddle  was on view, and so was the camaraderie and aggression that  made them such a dominant force in the World Cup. The pain of losing the final at  the Wanderers will linger but the Indians managed to restore  some pride at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium on Sunday evening.  It did not look to be so easy for the hosts till the mid-stages  of the Australian innings until Zaheer Khan dealt the first  blow. The credit should also go to stand-in  skipper Rahul Dravid, who brought back Zaheer after a disastrous  four-over first spell in which he gave away 24 runs. Adam  Gilchrists bails were knocked off as he tried to play across  in the 25th over. That opened the floodgates as Anil Kumble,  called back for his second spell, struck in consecutive  overs from the other end. Ricky Ponting misjudged the bounce  and Matthew Hayden paid the penalty for coming down the  track to the leg-spinner. Zaheer, too, got into the act  once more as Andrew Symonds departed to a questionable leg-before  decision from umpire K. Hariharan. From 132 for no loss, the visitors  had slipped to 141 for four. It did not seem possible for  Australia to make amends after this despite the efforts  of Damien Martyn and Michael Bevan. And that meant India  were victors by 37 runs in the second match of the TVS Cup  tri-series. Everything was going well for  Australia as Gilchrist cut loose and Hayden, having survived  an easy stumping chance on 19, played the supporting role  to perfection. The bowlers were carted around and it seemed  as if the Sachin Tendulkar-V.V.S. Laxman partnership would  be easily overshadowed. The Indians searched for vital  clues as the openers forged together a 132-run stand. Zaheer,  always dangerous with the old ball, found some reverse swing  and the unfamiliar Australian collapse unfolded. It only  proved that the world champions are, too, susceptible to  pressure. Once Kumble was rested, Virender  Sehwag made amends for his batting failure with a two-wicket  haul. Martyn and Bevan proved to be easy preys against his  turning deliveries. That this was going to be a tall-scoring  game was known even before Dravid had won the toss. The  predictable bounce of the ball, coming onto the bat, and  at an even pace, made the strokeplayers task that bit easier. Sachin and Laxman produced the  Diwali bonanza for the Sunday turnout with a flurry of strokes  which could have put to shame the deafening sound of the  firecrackers the marked the celebrations here last night.  The 191-run stand for the second wicket laid a solid foundation  for a daunting target. As Sachin and Laxman blasted away,  the Aussies were made to think of life after Glenn McGrath  and Jason Gillespie. Ponting had set out to a plan and that  involved attacking the Indians around the off stump with  Nathan Bracken being told to exploit their weakness against  angled deliveries from left-arm pacers. What the visiting skipper had  not bargained for was bowlers aiming for a sixth stump and  giving the batsmen extra room for shots. Bracken is no Wasim  Akram or Pedro Collins (who had troubled the maestro on  numerous occasions during Indias tour of the Caribbean  last year) and Sachin explained it to him in no uncertain  term after Sehwags suicidal dismissal. Not for a moment did the bowlers  manage to create any impact on them as Sachin used his experience  against an attack that lacked depth and variety. He toyed  with Bracken and never let Andy Bichel settle into a line. His 35th ODI hundred came off  109 balls and included nine boundaries and a six, off Ian  Harvey. In between, he also became the highest scorer in  day-night matches, surpassing Desmond Haynes tally of 4563. He also put to rest the Doubting  Thomases after his poor form in the Test series against  New Zealand. He found his confidence, his feet, and destroyed  an attack that deflated as swiftly as a pricked balloon. The Aussies tried everything possible,  even playing on the Master Blasters nerves. You can never  keep the Aussies down in the mind games. As Sachin seemed  dissatisfied with the movement behind the sight screen,  Ponting kept complaining to the umpires about the time being  lost. It only added to the pressure as Laxman exchanged  a few words with the Ausssie skipper. The disturbance was getting worse  with the stadium holding people more than its capacity.  At one point, an exasperated Sachin was forced to walk down  to the pavilion end to stop people from moving behind the  screen. Laxman was content playing second  fiddle at the outset, playing into the gaps, and rotating  the strike. But once he settled down, he could not be stopped.  He used his supple wrists to hit the ball pitched on off  and middle past cover or beat mid-wicket with a flick, leaving  bowlers and fielders scratching their heads. His second hundred in one-dayers  (102 off 134 balls, 9x4) ended with a brilliant throw from  Andrew Symonds from mid-wicket. In a superb move, Dravid kept  himself back and pushed Yuvraj Singh and Ajit Agarkar ahead  in the slog overs. Their late cameos helped the hosts near  the 300-mark. Copyright

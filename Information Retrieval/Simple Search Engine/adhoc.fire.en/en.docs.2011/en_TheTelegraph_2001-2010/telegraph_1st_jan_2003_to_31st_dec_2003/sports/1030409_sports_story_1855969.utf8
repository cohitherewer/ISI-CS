The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Real win 3-1
Madrid: Spectacular goals from Luis Figo and Raul (2) earned Real Madrid a 3-1 win over Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-final first leg Tuesday night. There seemed to be little danger when Figo collected a pass from Zinedine Zidane in the 12th minute and shuffled a couple of steps infield. The Portuguese midfielder spotted that Fabien Barthez was slightly out of position, and sent in a wickedly curling shot that crept in at the far corner. Zidane then slipped a pass through to Raul who fooled Rio Ferdinand with a backward feint and turned to drill a shot in at the near post. Raul made it 3-0 four minutes after half-time with another classical finish. United reduced margin through the prolific Ruud Van Nistelrooy.  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Hoagy may be hard to toss 
 FROM WILLIAM TELL Darashah Mysore: Having finished behind Crystal Delight earlier in the season, Hoagy looks the best of 12 three-year-olds to lift the 1,400m Chaitanya Chakram Plate, the main event on Wednesday here. The Metal Precieux-Stardust Melody colt, from trainer Z. Darashahs yard, seems to have improved with the benefit of that run and going by his recent workouts, he may be hard to beat in the hands of jockey K. P. Appu. The danger to Hoagy, if any, may come from Assortment who finished a late second to Jackie Brown.SELECTIONS2 pm: Baby Face Killer 1. Selena 2. National Crown 3.2.30 pm: River Nile 1.

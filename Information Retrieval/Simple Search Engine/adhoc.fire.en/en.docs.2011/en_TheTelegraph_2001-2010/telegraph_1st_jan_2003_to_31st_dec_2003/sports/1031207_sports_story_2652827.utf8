 Gilchrist praises Chopra, Sehwag
Brisbane, Dec. 6 (PTI): Australian wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist on Saturday was all praise for Indian openers Aakash Chopra and Virender Sehwag for their willingness to dig in during the six-odd overs of their innings on the third day of the first Test at the Gabba. They showed a willingness to get behind the ball, show a desire to dig in and looked prepared to do the hard work. It wasnt easy for them and there were couple of close calls, Gilchrist said. But as Justin (Langer) showed on the first day, you need a bit of luck to stay on this wicket and Indians deserved praise for the way they batted. Gilchrist said that despite loss of substantial play due to rain, his side could still force a result in the Test. Weather permitting, we have still two days left in this Test. There is a lot in this wicket and you never know. We have put 300 runs on the board and if our bowlers could consistently put the ball in the right areas, we could have a result, said Gilchrist. After the rain-truncated first two days, only 38 balls were possible on the third day when Australia were all out for 323 and Indians replied with 11 for no loss. Gilchrist though was not sure if his side would look to rush up their second innings later during the match and try and force a result. We did it against New Zealand and we nearly lost the game. It could have cost us the series. So we would be taking that into account. We would have to look at the variables, we are keen to chase results but it doesnt mean it would happen here. Still it would be Stephens (Waugh) call, he said. He said Nathan Bracken was asked to open the bowing with Jason Gillespie since the left-arm paceman had always been a new ball bowler and the way he did in India and against Sehwag led to him being preferred ahead of Andrew Bichel.

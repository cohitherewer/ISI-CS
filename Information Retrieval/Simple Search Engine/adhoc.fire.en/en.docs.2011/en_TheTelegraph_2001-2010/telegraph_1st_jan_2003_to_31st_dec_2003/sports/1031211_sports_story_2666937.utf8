 Barreto outbursts a serious concern: Aloke
 BY A STAFF REPORTER  Marker pressure affecting Barreto, says Aloke Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Aloke Mukherjee said on Wednesday that Jose Ramirez Barretos frequent loss of temper on the ground was posing a serious concern to his team. He said the player should be more careful about his composure and temperament for the teams cause. Barreto picked an argument with the referee Manuel Pareira after the latter turned down the Mohun Bagan appeal for a free-kick against Tollygunge Agragami at Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. This led to the Brazilians second booking in as many matches, rendering himself unavailable in Mohun Bagans next match against Indian Bank on Monday. Its alarming, a serious concern for all of us that a player like Barreto has often been losing temper, Aloke said. According to the Mohun Bagan coach, the constant pressure of playing with a marker might have been affecting Barreto. I have already had a session with him in this regard. But what can I do when despite being told to get his cool, he is losing temper? I have to sit again with him, remarked Aloke. The former international further admitted that the pressure was back on his team following the draw. We missed too many chances. We were under tremendous pressure once we failed to score in the first half, he added. Tollygunge coach and Alokes former national teammate, Krishnendu Roy also admitted his strategy of restricting Barreto paid off. As a player, I am against marking anybody because I believe this is detrimental to football as a beautiful game. But as a coach, my objective is to gain something out of nothing. Mohun Bagan are a big team but they are too Barreto-centric. On a day when Berreto off, so is his team. So I had to take special care of him and Shamsi (Reza) executed his role to perfection, he maintained. Krishnendu further maintained he had motivated his boys by telling them that a good result against a better team would open up opportunities for them in future. If they perform well, they will be noticed by big clubs. Even a national call-up can await them, he said.  Copyright

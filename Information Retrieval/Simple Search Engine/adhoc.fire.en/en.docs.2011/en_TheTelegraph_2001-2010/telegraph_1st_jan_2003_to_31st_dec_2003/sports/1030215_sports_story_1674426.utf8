The Telegraph - Calcutta
 England decision
Johannesburg: The World Cup technical committee will announce its decision over Englands match in Zimbabwe on Saturday at 6.30 GMT, just hours before the India-Australia match, an ICC spokesman said on Friday. The committee met on Friday afternoon to discuss the controversial fixture, originally scheduled for Thursday. The England and Wales Cricket Board wants to move the game to South Africa because of safety concerns in Zimbabwe, but the ICC has so far maintained it is safe to play in Harare.

 Beckham has no choice but to leave, feels Stam
 Jaap Stam London: Former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam believes that England skipper David Beckham has no choice but to leave Manchester United or rot in the reserves. Barcelona, Real Madrid and AC Milan are all reported to be interested in signing Beckham after Alex Fergusons decision to sell him. And Stam, whom Ferguson sold to Lazio for 16.5 million two years ago, believes that leaving Old Trafford is the only option for the midfielder. Once Ferguson decides you are no longer part of his plans for whatever reasons, there is no turning back, Stam told the Sunday Mirror. You are like an unwanted piece of baggage and you have to weigh up whether its worth hanging around when there is no chance of playing. I think you are just expected to accept it, there is no plan in place if you decide youre not going other than the fact you will probably be left to rot in the reserves, the Dutchman said. I am sure the other players are surprised by Beckhams departure and the way it has happened. I know a lot of them will not want to see him leave. United have already agreed a fee with Barcelona presidential candidate Joan Laporta. For that deal to have any chance of becoming a reality, Laporta must win.  (AFP)  Copyright

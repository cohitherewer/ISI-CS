				 																																	London: Englands rugby World Cup-winning captain Martin Johnson might be asked to take over as coach of Leicester. Johnson, 33, who will not say before Christmas whether he will continue his Test career, could be offered the Leicester job if current coach Dean Richards goes to Stade Francais. Reports on Tuesday said that would happen if the French sides own coach, Nick Mallett, took over from Rudolf Straeuli as Springbok coach. Straeulis fate could be decided on Thursday when he delivers his World Cup report to the South African rugby union which is investigating the now notorious pre-World Cup boot camp. Mallett coached South Africa up to the 1999 World Cup when they lost in the semi-finals to Australia and would only return on his own terms and with certain assurances. 				 																																	London: Jaguar Formula One motor racing team have sacked Britains Justin Wilson and replaced him with Austrian Christian Klien. The Ford-owned Formula One team said on Tuesday that the 20-year-old Klein will race alongside Australian Mark Webber next year. Klien, runner-up in German Formula Three this year, impressed Jaguar with his speed and attitude during testing at Valencia recently.				 																																	Christian was in as much control of himself as he was the car, said David Pitchforth, Managing Director of Jaguar Racing. He was extremely calm, composed and didnt seem remotely fazed by his first ever experience with a Formula One car. His technical feedback was excellent and there is no doubt in our minds about the potential of this exciting new young talent. Klein, who was due to test with Jaguar in Barcelona on Tuesday, had his first experience of a Formula One car only last week. 				 																																	Kiev: Ukrainian top flight club Poltava has been deducted three points following a positive dope test of Slovenian midfielder Rusmin Dedic, the countrys football federation announced Tuesday. Dedic, 21, is now facing a ban as the second player from the Ukrainian league this season to test positive for banned substances. It was not immediately revealed which substance he tested positive for after Poltavas league win over Mariupol on November 9.				 																																	Munich: Bayern Munich president Franz Beckenbauer has told the players to start performing or face seeing their season come to an abrupt end by December. A 2-2 draw with bottom Bundesliga side Cologne on Saturday saw Bayern sink to a new low and Beckenbauer, ahead of three key fixtures in seven days for the club, has demanded results from the star-studded Bavarian side. The players have to pull themselves together, Beckenbauer fumed in German daily Bild. Otherwise, the season will be over by December.				 																																	He added: They have known each other for so long that they should know how to play with one another. But they do not run. They just stand around. I do not see any urgency, effort or movement. Auckland: Former New Zealand All Black  Jeff Wilson, who retired from rugby union two years ago  to pursue his dream to play Test cricket snapped up five  wickets for Otago on Tuesday. The 30-year-old had figures  of five for 82 as Canterbury hit 375 in their first innings  in a Shell Championship game in Timaru. Wilson played four  one-day Internationals for New Zealand against Australia  in 1993 but he was lost to cricket the same year when he  toured Scotland and England with All Blacks.

 UCBSA praise for Pollock
 POLLOCK: Exceptional commitment Durban: Former South African captain Shaun Pollock, who was sacked from his post following his teams poor show in the World Cup, has received praise from the countrys national cricket committee. The NCC was unanimous in complimenting Pollock on his conduct and continued commitment to the team while lauding him after holding a meeting in Cape Town on Thursday. Shaun has conducted himself with dignity and grace through what has been a difficult time for him. His positive approach and his exceptional commitment continue to make him a most valuable asset to South African cricket. Shaun must be complimented on his attitude and thanked for it, CEO of the United Cricket Board of South Arica (UCBSA) and NCC chairman Gerald Majola said. He appreciated Pollock, who has vowed never to return as captain but still maintains the same dedication to the team. Shaun has seized the new opportunities that he faces in his role as a senior player and he has committed himself again to the national squad and to contributing to ensure that the team performs as a successful unit under the new captain Graeme Smith, he said. Soon after their first-round exit from the World Cup, Pollock was sacked as captain and replaced by young opener Smith.  (PTI)  Copyright

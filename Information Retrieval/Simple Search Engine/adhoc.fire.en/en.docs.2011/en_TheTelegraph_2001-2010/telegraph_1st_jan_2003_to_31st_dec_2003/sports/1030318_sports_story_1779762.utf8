 Ancheri to lead India
Panaji: Bhaichung Bhutia has been left out of Indias 18-member squad for the Asia Cup preliminary round match against North Korea in Pyongyang on March 24. He has been recuperating from a ligament injury and was recalled to the probables camp last month. But he underwent another surgery in Delhi last week which ruled him out of the first-leg of the meet. Meanwhile, Jo Paul Ancheri will lead India in the game. After an indifferent beginning to the season, Ancheri has been playing some superb football of late for his club JCT. Also in the squad is his veteran mate, I.M. Vijayan. Injured Debjit Ghosh has been rested for the game. SQUAD Naseem Aktar, Sandip Nandy, Dipak Mondal, Mahesh Gawli, M. Suresh, Arun Malhotra, Jules Alberto, Subhash Chakraborty, Climax Lawrence, Renedy Singh, Sameer Naik, Roque Baretto, Tomba Singh, Alex Ambrose, Alvito DCunha, I.M.

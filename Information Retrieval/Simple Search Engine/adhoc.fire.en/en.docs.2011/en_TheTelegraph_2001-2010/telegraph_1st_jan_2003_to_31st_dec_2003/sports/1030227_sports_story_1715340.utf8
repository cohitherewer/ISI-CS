The Telegraph - Calcutta
 I wont hang around if the team doesnt move from B to A: Wright
'A coach should be in a position to tell selectors if a player, no matter how big, needs to be dropped' FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Durban: The players arent the only ones under pressure, the heat gets to the coach as well. It becomes more difficult if a coach is to be judged on how his team fares in the World Cup. John Wright, then, is under considerable pressure.Despite demands on time, though, Wright spoke to The Telegraph the other evening for half-an-hour. While he has made a difference to Team India, Wright indicated he may not be inclined to seek an extension (his contract ends in March) if Sourav Ganguly and Co. dont earn high marks in the World Cup.The following are excerpts On 27 months as the India coachWhatever the past, Ive been focussing on this week for some time... Its one of the biggest weeks ever for Indian cricket. Weve been getting a lot of advice from different quarters, but its important to keep a perspective on things. On Indias non-performance in New Zealand, the last engagement before the World CupIt hurt, more so as I wanted New Zealanders to see the quality of the team I was involved with... Yet, we never got runs, be it in the Tests or the ODIs. We ought to have fought harder but, fortunately, weve been able to put those six weeks behind us.On whether some of the advice, in recent times, has been unsolicited and that much of the criticism unwarrantedGoes with the territory, doesnt it? (After a pause) I think my employers (the BCCI) and the fans, who remain so passionate, have been fair... Wins and losses will happen and I also accept there must be accountability... Criticism isnt a problem, a lack of effort is. I expect a fight to the finish in every game, I also expect high intensity at nets... (Pauses again) I accept there will be some controversy, that some people may still say Im a foreigner-coach... Fact is, Ive done the best I could.On whether, after 27 months, he regards himself a foreigner-coachBut, I am... Ive got a much better grasp of things in Indian cricket, Im more into Indian cricket... However, I remain a foreigner and some continue to think a foreigner shouldnt be coaching the national team.On the nucleus remaining the same (from end 2000 till now)I may not have got everything right, but Ive done my best... Obviously, irrespective of the set of players, there will be occasions when a result will throw up questions: Was the preparation good enough? Was the intensity of the desired level? Having said that, such questions shouldnt come from the coach only  even the players must ask exactly the same if the showing hasnt been good. Ive been getting the team to make presentations and, so, everybody has a role in the planning besides the execution. On players repeating mistakes(Grins) I try not to get emotional... If I do, I could react the wrong way... Of course, its hugely disappointing because, then, the player in question is consistently not contributing to the larger game plan. I appreciate that players must play their own way, but should do so according to the situation. No one, after all, can play in a vacuum. (After a pause) I have, at times, made it plain that enough is enough. On the key attributes for him: Passion and commitmentWeve got to be ruthless. If the hunger and commitment isnt there, then the door must be opened for others. Having the passion and whatever is fine, but the job must still be done in the middle. As Ive said, the team must fight... Thats what I want and, believe me, I hate surrender. (After a pause) I think we lost some of our hunger after winning the Chennai Test and taking that series (against the West Indies)... Yes, I realise that the players go through pressure situations at different times in their career, that theres a time for commercial opportunities...On whether the report about his having been sounded out to coach New Zealand, while the team wasnt doing well in New Zealand itself, embarrassed himI dont know who concocted that... Nobody approached me and the question to be asked is: Why should New Zealand look at me or somebody else when they already have a coach (Denis Aberhart) who is doing well? That report was a complete fabrication. On whether BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiyas straight talking on the eve of the teams departure for the World Cup unsettled himNo... Hes a straight-shooter and Ive always maintained I will be accountable. Anybody in any position is accountable... Im paid to get results and the bottomline is that our performance in New Zealand wasnt good enough... So, the accountability bit hasnt ever been a problem with me. But, yes, its terribly frustrating when Ive done everything I could and the team still plays poorly... Equally, there could be occasions when the team has been in a spot of bother and somebody produces a blinder... Goes with the job, I suppose.On being aware that, essentially, he will be judged on the World Cup performanceIts fine with me... My contract is till the end of the tournament and, if I dont get the results, I wont have a problem with somebody taking my place. Twenty-seven months ago, I said Im privileged to coach India. That hasnt changed.On whether he will be game for an extension(Smiles) Lets see how the World Cup goes... If we dont progress, I may not have to make up my mind... Im not going to hang around for the coachs job... I wouldnt want it if the team doesnt move from B to A or A-1 from A... In any case, once the tournament gets over, there will be an opportunity for both the BCCI and I to undertake a review. (After a pause) Ill have a few issues to raise and, surely, the BCCI will have something to say. On the appalling behaviour by so-called fans after the big defeat at the hands of Australia My own belief is they were showing their frustration over what happened in New Zealand... They were waiting for... Indeed, weve got to be accountable to the fans as well. Theres been so much hype over the World Cup... Expectations and hype do go hand in hand.On his behind-the-scenes contribution in getting Adrian le Roux (the physical trainer) on board and having Sandy Gordon interact with the playersWell, I was keen on a physical trainer because we needed somebody to work on an important area, an area of weakness for the team... I first met Sandy in Bangalore (at the National Cricket Academy) and felt it wouldnt be a bad idea if the players heard another voice. In any case, hes at the top in his trade... He cant change things by popping in and out, but can certainly get the players to think about something. On whether he found his position getting compromised when talk arose about appointing a bowling coachI wouldnt have a problem with the right person... Its an area that needs to be explored, but it wont help if somebody just comes for a week or so. The person has to be around for some time and, clearly, there must be continuity... In time, I think this area will be explored.On whether he has specially learnt something as the India coachThat theres enormous potential. Currently, were only scratching the surface.On whether the coach should have a greater say in selectionTo the extent that if somebodys effort isnt quite there, he should be able to tell the selectors that the concerned player  no matter how big  should be dropped. Personally, Ill be happy with an arrangement where a sharp message can be sent.Finally, on the belief that he has been soft on the playersIve been accused of that but, look, Ive always tried to work with the players... If you wield the stick too much, they will shut their ears and go their own way... If I had the freedom to chop and change, if somebody wasnt putting in that effort,  Copyright

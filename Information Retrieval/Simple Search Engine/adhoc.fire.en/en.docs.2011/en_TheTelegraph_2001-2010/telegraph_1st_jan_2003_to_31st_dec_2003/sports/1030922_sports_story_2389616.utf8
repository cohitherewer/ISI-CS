 Deep, Rohan in India A squad
Chennai: Bengals Deep Dasgupta and Rohan Gavaskar have been named in the India A team for the three-dayer against New Zealand to be played in Rajkot from October 2-4. Wicketkeeper Deep comes back to reckoning after quite some time, since being dropped from the national team after touring the West Indies last year. Rohan, who toured England with the India A team this year and also figured in the Challenger Series and Irani Trophy, has been under the observation of national selectors of late. The selectors, who on Sunday picked the Board Presidents XI and India A squads for the matches against New Zealand, opted for several new medium pacers like Barodas Munaf Patel and Sreesanth of Kerala. They also gave a chance to Tinu Yohannan. Virender Sehwag was named skipper of the Board Presidents XI for the match in Visakhapatnam from September 26-28. Mohammed Kaif was selected as captain for the Rajkot match. V.V.S. Laxman, along with Yuvraj Singh and Shiv Sundar Das, was named in the Board Presidents XI. The squads were picked by four of the five national selectors and coach John Wright as selection committee chairman Brijesh Patel stayed away owing to illness.

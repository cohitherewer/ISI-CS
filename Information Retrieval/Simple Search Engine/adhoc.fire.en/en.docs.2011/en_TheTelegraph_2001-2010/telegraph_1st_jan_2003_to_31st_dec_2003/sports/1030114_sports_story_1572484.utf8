The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Further losses for Bhowmick
 BY A STAFF REPORTER																								Calcutta: East Bengal, already without nine players of their first XI, got further shocks Monday when it was learnt that Tushar Rakshit and Chandan Das will be unavailable for the rest of the IFA Shield.																								The midfielders will have to play for their employers in the inter-bank tournament, scheduled to start later this week. East Bengal officials have requested that they be allowed to play for the club, but it is unlikely they will be released.																								East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick was obviously a worried man after Mondays come-from-behind victory over Indian Bank. We have been playing continuously for the past two weeks. Already some of the boys are carrying niggling injuries, today the injury to Kaustav flared up, Bhowmick added.																								He defended his team for the below-par show. I did not get them to practise Sunday as they have been overworked, he added.

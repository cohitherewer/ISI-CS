The Telegraph - Calcutta
		 Saturday, November 22, 2003  Own Vision has edge 
 BY STAR RACER				 	 Daniel David				 										Calcutta: Its a toss-up between the city challenger Evangeline and the southern invader Own Vision in the 1,600m Calcutta 1000 Guineas, the first classic of the season that takes the main slot in Saturdays eight-event card. Looks apart, the two fillies select themselves on superior credentials against the rest of the opposition.				 										Own Vision has the Deccan Bookmakers Fillies Trial Stakes under her belt, while Evangeline boasts of a runaway victory in the monsoon version of the 1,000 Guineas. However, the fact that Own Vision has matched strides against a formidable opposition in Bangalore, tilts the scales in favour of the Daniel David-trained filly. B. Prakash partners the Razeen-Treasure Land daughter.				 										Daniel and Prakash may also see their ward Noble Executive winning the Mayfowl Cup, a terms race over 1,400 metres. The Placerville-Academic son is being rated a much improved horse by his connections. However, the four-year-old may face stiff resistance from Bharath Singhs Alcalde and Vijay Singhs Calamint, who are well-placed by the terms of the race. 				 										Accuser may be hard to toss in the 1,600m Darbhanga Cup. The monsoon Derby winner is not only enjoying handicap advantage over each of his four rivals, he is also looking quite fit.

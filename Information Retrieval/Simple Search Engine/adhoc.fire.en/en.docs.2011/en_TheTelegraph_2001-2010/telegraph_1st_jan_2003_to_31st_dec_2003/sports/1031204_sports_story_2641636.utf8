The Telegraph - Calcutta
 CAB gags Ghavri
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The CAB has barred Karsan Ghavri from interacting with the media on a daily basis. The Bengal Ranji coach had so far been very candid with his views. The coach, approached by mediamen after stumps on Day III of the Bengal-Assam tie, asked them to wait for a couple of minutes and went into the ground. It was then that the CAB officials instructed him not to air his views. Sorry friends, the CAB has told me to interact with the media only before and after a match, the coach said a little later. In his explanation, joint secretary Bablu Koley talked about a decorum of the CAB that does not allow the coach to talk during a match. What he didnt clarify was why the CAB had suddenly remembered decorum on the third day of Bengals fourth game this season. Meanwhile, it was learnt that Dibyendu Chakraborty and Anustup Mazumdar are the likely replacements of Subhamoy Das and Amitava Chakraborty for Bengals next game against Hyderabad (beginning Tuesday).

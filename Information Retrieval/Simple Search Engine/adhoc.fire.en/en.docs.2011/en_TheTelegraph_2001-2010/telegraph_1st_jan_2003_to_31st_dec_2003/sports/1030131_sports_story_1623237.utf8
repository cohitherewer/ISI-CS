		 Friday, January 31, 2003 				 Mallorca rout under-strength Real 4-0
																								Madrid: Real Mallorca blasted their way into the Kings Cup semi-finals after a whirlwind 4-0 victory over an under-strength Real Madrid at Son Moix on Wednesday.																								The Balearic islanders completely outclassed the European champions as they raced into a 3-0 first-half lead, which included a fine early header from Fernando Nino and a brilliantly worked double from striker Samuel Etoo.																								Real never recovered and Uruguayan striker Walter Pandiani added a fourth early in the second half to inflict a humiliating 5-1 aggregate defeat on Vicente del Bosques side.																								Wednesdays other quarter-final between Osasuna and Sevilla, who had drawn 1-1 in the first leg, was a far more evenly balanced affair and it took a breathless period of extra time for the home side to claim a 4-3 aggregate victory.																								With the score 1-1 at the end of normal time Osasuna skipper Cesar Palacios gave Osasuna the lead eight minutes into extra time. The Andalucians fought back, though, and looked to be heading for an away goals victory when Francisco Casquero hit home to make it 2-2 early in the second period of extra-time.																								But Osasuna finally claimed victory and a place in the semi-finals when Inaki Munoz converted from the spot in the 115th minute after Sevilla keeper Antonio Notario had brought down Gorka Brit in the area.																								On Tuesday, bottom club Recreativo Huelva caused a minor upset when they produced a dogged defensive display to hold Atletico Madrid to a 0-0 draw at the Calderon and secure a place in the last four.																								The goalless draw meant Recreativos 1-0 home win in the first leg was enough to end Atleticos dreams of winning the Cup in their centenary season. Holders Deportivo Coruna will attempt to avoid another upset as they defend a 1-0 advantage at second division leaders Murcia on Thursday.																								Explosive start																								Mallorca, who drew 1-1 at the Bernabeu in the first leg, made an explosive start as they tore into Real Madrid and deprived them of the ball in the opening minutes.																								Real, who were playing without Ronaldo and Luis Figo but with Zinedine Zidane and Raul, looked uncomfortable as Mallorca outpassed them in midfield and pinned them in their area.																								It was little surprise when the home side snatched the lead after just eight minutes when unmarked defender Nino outjumped the Real defence to head home direct from a corner.																								The European champions were then dealt a knock-out blow when former player Samuel Etoo struck twice inside five minutes to give Mallorca a 3-0 lead before the break. The Cameroon international grabbed his first on 31 minutes when he fired past reserve goalkeeper Cesar after picking up a fine pass from winger Ariel Ibagaza on the edge of the area.																								The 21-year-old striker then scored his second when he provided the finishing touch to a superb passing move that cut through the out-of-sorts Real defence.																								Young midfielder Albert Riera began the move with a neat through pass to veteran defender Miquel Soler, who drew Cesar off his line before cutting the ball back to Etoo who guided home with ease.																								Gregorio Manzanos side picked up where they had left off in the second half. The impressive Riera slammed a powerful shot against the bar immediately after the break and Pandiani completed another spectacular passing move to make it 4-0 in the 49th minute.																								Ibagaza carved open the Real defence once more after a swift exchange of passes with Etoo and the Argentine winger provided the perfect service for Pandiani to crack home a first-time shot and complete an impressive win for the islanders. 																								 Monaco defeat Nantes 																								An early goal by midfielder Ludovic Giuly inspired Monaco to a richly deserved 2-0 victory at Nantes in the French first division on Wednesday.																								Didier Deschampss team climbed to third place, three points behind leaders Olympique Marseille, who beat Nice 2-0 on Tuesday. Champions Olympique Lyon are second two points behind leaders. (Reuters)

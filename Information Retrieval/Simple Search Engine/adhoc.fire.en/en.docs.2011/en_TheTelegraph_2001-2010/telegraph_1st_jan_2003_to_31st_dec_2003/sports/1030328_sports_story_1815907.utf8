The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Pak squad docked 50% of earnings
 Akram: Case taking a new turn Karachi: Members of the Pakistan World Cup squad have been docked half their earnings from the tournament because of poor performances. This was an agreement signed before the World Cup and the players agreed to performance-based terms and conditions, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman Samiul Hasan said Thursday. The agreement was that if they failed to go beyond the preliminary rounds, they would face 50 per cent deductions from their total earnings from the tournament. Pakistan failed to make the Super Sixes after winning only two matches in the preliminary round (against minnows Namibia and The Netherlands). Hearing adjourned Meanwhile, in Islamabad, a probe into match-fixing allegations against Akram on Thursday took a new turn with the inquiry officer withdrawing from it at the last minute. The PCB has subsequently adjourned the hearing on the appeal filed by Akram to review match-fixing allegations against him. The board said that inquiry officer Zakir Khan, also the general manager, cricket operations, of the PCB, expressed his inability to conduct the hearing saying Akram was a close friend.

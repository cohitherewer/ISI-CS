 CAB plans to get jacuzzi for gym 
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta: The CAB seems to be going all out to ensure a fit Bengal squad for the forthcoming Ranji Trophy season. And India captain Sourav Ganguly is helping with the inputs. It has been learnt that Sourav, who regularly works out at the Pankaj Gupta gymnasium, has asked the authorities to have a jacuzzi installed to give a complete look to it. Though CAB secretary Bablu Kolay was quite prompt to deny any plans of getting a jacuzzi, the authorities are giving it a serious thought. A jacuzzi is actually a smaller version of a swimming pool which helps the players to relax their muscles after a work-out. An official informed that at present, the players have to travel all the way to the Ordnance Club to avail the swimming pool there. However, its a costly business and has to be passed by the working committee, the official added. Meanwhile, the trio of Deep Dasgupta, Devang Gandhi and Ranadeb Bose, who are currently in England and have not joined the pre-season conditioning camp in spite of repeated intimations by the CAB, will not be automatic choices for the Ranji Trophy squad. If the boys who are currently playing the pre-season tournaments perform, we will think twice before including the trio, another official, preferring anonymity, said.  Copyright

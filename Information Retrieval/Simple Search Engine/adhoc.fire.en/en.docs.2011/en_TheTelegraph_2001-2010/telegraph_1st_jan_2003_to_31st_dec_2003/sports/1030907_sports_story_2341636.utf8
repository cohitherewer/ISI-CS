The Telegraph - Calcutta
 3 firms in deal with BCCI
 BY A STAFF REPORTER Calcutta, Sept. 6: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) scripted another first in the history of the countrys most popular sport by signing a three-year consortium deal with Pepsi, TVS Motors and Videocon. Announcing the news shortly after the contract was signed this afternoon, BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya said these three companies would take turns to sponsor all Test and one-day International series in India for the period upto May 31, 2006. Even though an understanding has been reached as to who will be the title sponsors of each home series spanning the next three years, the details of only this seasons engagements were revealed on Saturday. While Videocon will be sponsoring the three-Test series versus New Zealand, the tri-series (involving the hosts, Australia and New Zealand) will be under the TVS Motors banner. TVS Motors were represented by R. Chandramouli, vice-president (sales and marketing), Videocon by Sunil Tandon, vice-president (marketing) and Pepsi by Shashi Kalathil, executive director (marketing). Two names conspicuous by their absence are Hero Honda and LG. We have been very careful in choosing our partners like-minded companies sympathetic towards the cause of cricket and cricketers have been considered. The arrangements with Hero Honda and LG have been put on hold as talks are still going on, was how Dalmiya explained the pairs absence from the consortium. LG has been demanding compensation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) for alleged breach of contract during the Champions Trophy and World Cup while Hero Honda has reserved the right to claim damages for the next editions of these two high-profile tournaments. Its not difficult to surmise that once these companies fall in line the BCCI would consider having them back on board vis--vis international cricket. Dalmiya did, however, add that all other existing arrangements with Hero Honda would continue. Pepsi, it may be recalled, had also sought compensation from the BCCI before subsequently backing off. Thats why they have been rewarded with a renewal in the sponsorship deal.  Rs 2 lakh for Ramchand Dalmiya also announced on Saturday that the BCCI will be giving a sum of Rs 2 lakh for the treatment of G.S. Ramchand. The former India captain, who played 33 Tests, has been admitted to a Mumbai hospital following a cardiac arrest.  Copyright

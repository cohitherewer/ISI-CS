		 Sunday, January 26, 2003 				 Serena makes history
 							 - As a kid, I always dreamt of it, always wanted to do it FROM LISA DILLMAN				 	 Serena Williams of the US with the winners trophy in Melbourne on Saturday. (AFP) 																								Melbourne, Jan. 25: For Serena Williams, the competition has moved off the court and transferred to the dry pages of history. The new challenges do not come from the likes of her older sister, Venus, but in pursuing legendary figures such as Maureen Connolly, Margaret Court and Steffi Graf.																								Venus was the final obstacle standing between Serena and the Serena Slam, winning four consecutive Grand Slam titles. After two hours 22 minutes, the long journey, the fulfillment of Serenas vision culminated Saturday at the Australian Open. The top-seeded Serena defeated No. 2 Venus, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 6-4, in the final, in what was the best final between the sisters in Grand Slams.																								At 21, Serena, who won her first Australian Open title, joined Graf and Martina Navratilova as winners of non-calendar year Grand Slams, as her streak started at the French Open last year. Her opposition in the four Slam finals was Venus. And, looking ahead, this was the first step of another Slam, one in the same calendar year, achieved by Connolly, Court and Graf.																								I just cant believe I can now be compared to these women because theyre such greats, Serena said. And Ive really been able to look up to them. I dont know if Ill ever accomplish everything that they have, but just to even be in that category of winning four in a row, for me, its really amazing.																								As a kid, I always dreamt of it, and Ive always wanted to do it.																								Serena increased her total of Slam titles to five and leads her head-to-head series with Venus, 6-5. This was where their first match as professionals took place. The Australian Open was Serenas first Grand Slam, and she lost to Venus in the second round in 1998. So many times in their early rivalry, Venus was the one who had to comfort her younger sister, who was bitterly disappointed after losing.																								In an odd twist, Venus was doing the consoling again. Serena had a subdued celebration after Venus forehand sailed out on match point, hugging her sister and blowing kisses to the crowd. During the victory ceremony, Serena grew emotional.																								I never get choked up, never, but Im really emotional right now, Serena said, tears in her eyes.																								She thanked her parents and stepped away, and Venus looked concerned. In her speech, Venus dedicated her appearance in the final to her grandmother, who passed away recently. Venus had been playing in her first Australian Open final and looked heartened that she managed to make it competitive. In her previous four matches against Serena, she had not been able to win a set.																								Venus served bigger, hitting seven aces and coming up with service winners on big points. Her fastest serve was 121 miles per hour. The fighting spirit Serena has displayed this tournament was in evidence. When her serve was broken at 4-4 in the first set, she sent her racket flying toward her equipment bag on the sideline. 																								Serena took the first-set tiebreaker, 7-4, breaking down Venus forehand. The second set went to Venus, 6-3, the first one she had been able to win against Serena since the 2001 US Open final, which Venus won in straight sets.																								The third set held great promise, had the expected dramatic moments, but never turned into a classic.  LOS ANGELES TIMES WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

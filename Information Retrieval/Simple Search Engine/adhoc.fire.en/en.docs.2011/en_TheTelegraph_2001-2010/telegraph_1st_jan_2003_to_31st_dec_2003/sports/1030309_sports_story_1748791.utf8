 FROM LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI  Johannesburg: Jawagal Srinath has been bowling at his best, but theres a more than reasonable chance that this champion new ball-operator will quit after the World Cup.Of course, Srinath himself didnt say anything beyond I dont have much cricket left, when The Telegraph sought a comment the other evening, but well-placed sources insist his mind is made up.Apparently, Srinath has told well-wishers that while he doesnt have a problem actually spearheading the attack, the preparatory bit has become very tedious. Clearly, after 12 years in the big league, Srinath seems to have had enough of the physical training and gym work. Srinath, it may be recalled, quit Test cricket after last years tour of the West Indies, but made a comeback (at captain Sourav Ganguly and chief selector Brijesh Patels behest) when the Windies returned the visit. Since then, he has been brilliant.Incidentally, Srinath (33) is now Indias most successful bowler in ODIs. In Cape Town, Friday, he overtook Anil Kumble (308). Today, Srinath is exactly one better.Meanwhile, the Indians arrived here late this afternoon and will face Sri Lanka at the Wanderers Monday. Owing to weight limitations on the flight from Cape Town, the luggage came later.While no workout was scheduled, the team did have an engagement at night: Dinner to celebrate Parthiv Patels 18th  Copyright

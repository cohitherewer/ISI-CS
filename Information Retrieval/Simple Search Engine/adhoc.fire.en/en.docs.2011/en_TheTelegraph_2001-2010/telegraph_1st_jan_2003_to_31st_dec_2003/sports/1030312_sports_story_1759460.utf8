The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kenyans on a mission today
 - Super Six Crunch Match vs Zimbabwe Kenya captain Steve  Tikolo (extreme right) during training with teammates  in Bloemfontein Tuesday. (AP/PTI)  Bloemfontein: Kenya coach  Sandeep Patil has blasted his teams critics and insisted  his unheralded side will prove they are worth their place  in the World Cup Super Sixes. Kenya face Zimbabwe here Wednesday  knowing that a win will virtually assure them of a semi-final  spot and that would deliver a hammer blow to those who believe  their presence in the second phase has made a mockery of  the tournament. A lot of people seem unhappy that were  still involved, said Patil in a reference to the way Kenya  were gifted four points when New Zealand forfeited their  February 21 match in Nairobi.  Its not just down to luck. Weve  played some good cricket. By reaching the Super Six, which  was one of our goals, weve taken half a step forward. But  another win would be one more half step and the icing on  the cake. Every game is a big game for  us, said Patil, a member of Indias 1983 World Cup winning  team. He added that for Kenya just reaching this stage was  a triumph in itself. Going into this tournament wed played  just 18 one-day Internationals in four years.			Kenya have never beaten Zimbabwe  in 14 ODIs, their fellow Africans winning 12 with two no-results.  But Patil is not too concerned, having watched his men produce  one of the shocks of the tournament  beating Sri Lanka  in the group phase. Our record against anyone is not that  good, he cheerfully admitted. But we are capable of causing  these upsets, so why not another one? Henry Olonga took six for 28 in  Zimbabwes nine-wicket win when the teams last met in Bulawayo  in December, but Olonga hasnt played since Zimbabwes opening  group match against Namibia on February 10 in Harare, a  match where he and Andy Flower wore black armbands and issued  a statement lamenting the death of democracy in Zimbabwe. That December 15 match was also  Alistair Campbells last for zimbabwe. But the former captain  turned television commentator won a dramatic recall following  the skull fracture sustained by Mark Vermeulen which ruled  him out of the rest of the tournament. Campbell, whose kit has still  to arrive, said Zimbabwe were in for a tough game. The  Kenyans have got no world-beaters, but their bowlers bowl  an irritating length, there are not too many balls to hit.  And their batsmen are capable of posting a score, he said.  Flower is expected to play but Whittalls hamstring problem  will be assessed again. Travis Friend, the man who inadvertently  ended Vermeulens World Cup at the nets here and was a substitute  fielder in the six-wicket defeat by New Zealand, could well  start as Zimbabwe are a bowler short after losing Brian  Murphy to a calf injury. His place in the squad has gone  to Stuart Matsikenyeri. TEAMS  Zimbabwe (from): Heath  Streak (captain), Andy Blignaut, Dion Ebrahim, Sean Ervine,  Andy Flower, Grant Flower, Travis Friend, Douglas Hondo,  Douglas Marillier, Henry Olonga, Tatenda Taibu, Alistair  Campbell, Guy Whittall, Craig Wishart, Stuart Matsikenyeri.  Kenya: Steve Tikolo (captain),  Maurice Odumbe, Asif Karim, Alpesh Vadher, Ravindu Shah,  Hitesh Modi, Brijal Patel, Martin Suji, Tony Suji, Thomas  Odoyo, Kennedy Otieno, Joseph Angara, Peter Ongondo, David  Obuya, Collins Obuya.

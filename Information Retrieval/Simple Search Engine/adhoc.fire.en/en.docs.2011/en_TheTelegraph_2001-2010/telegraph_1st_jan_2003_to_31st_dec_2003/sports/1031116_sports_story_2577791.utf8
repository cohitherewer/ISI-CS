The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Karnataka off to sound start
Mandya, Nov. 15 (PTI): Responsible knocks by skipper J. Arunkumar and Roland Barrington helped hosts Karnataka score 126 for no loss against Bengal on a truncated opening day of the four-day elite B group Ranji Trophy cricket match here today. The start of play was delayed by at least four hours due to wet pitch conditions following overnight heavy rains. Umpires Ravi Deshmukh and T. R. Kashyappan inspected the pitch in the morning and ruled out play till the afternoon when another inspection led to play starting at 2.30 pm. Arunkumar and Barrington started off with a flourish and hit the Bengal bowlers all round the park, much to the delight of the sizeable weekend crowd. Arunkumar scored 50 runs off 145 balls with nine fours and Barringon (57) hit four boundaries off 144 deliveries to lay a solid foundation. Only 46 overs could be bowled, with play having to be called off due to poor light with two overs still to be bowled.  Copyright

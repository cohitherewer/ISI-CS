The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Kumble hungry for more
 FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT  Kumble is on a split hattrick Adelaide, Dec. 13: I landed in Australia wanting to enjoy myself and, besides, to give my best whenever opportunities came my way... So, Im happy with the five-wicket haul here, remarked senior pro Anil Kumble after Day II of the second Test at the Oval. Comparing the 1999-2000 series to the current one, he said: This time, Im more experienced... Then, after the surgery (in January 2001), my bowling shoulder is stronger... Of course, there are times when the hard work isnt immediately rewarded... Incidentally, thanks to Shane Warne, Kumble had a tete-a-tete with his guru, Terry Jenner, and went on record to thank the latter for his suggestions. Asked by The Telegraph whether he was already a victim of the butterflies-in-the-stomach bit, given that he was on a split hattrick, Kumble responded: Not at all... Rather, Im hungry... He confirmed being on a split hattrick for the first time.  Copyright

 Eric Simons warning
East London: South Africas coach Eric Simons says some strong teams at the World Cup have become arrogant, focussing more on boosting their run rate instead of beating minnows such as Canada or Kenya. A case in point was Sri Lankas shock defeat on Monday against Kenya, which gallantly defended a total of 210 to win by 53 runs, Simons said on Wednesday, on the eve of South Africas match against the Canadians. Its very dangerous for any side (to take a game lightly), Simons said. You have to respect anybody with a bat or ball.  (AP)  Copyright

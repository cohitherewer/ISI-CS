The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Streak still optimistic
Southampton: Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak was in an optimistic mood despite the England tour ending with a crushing seven-wicket tri-series defeat by South Africa. He again led from the front, top-scoring with 50 not out in Zimbabwes 173 for eight at Hampshires Rose Bowl ground. South Africa easily overhauled that total with more than 14 overs to spare. For Zimbabwe, this defeat meant they ended their tour with just one tri-series win to go with their two innings defeats in their Tests against England earlier in the season. Streak, whose individual performances never slackened despite the pressures on him, admitted: Losing is always disappointing. But he was optimistic: Ive seen a lot of talent. Theres a lot to work with. Geoff (Marsh) and I have got a long road ahead but in two or three years time this could be a good side, Streak insisted. (AFP)  Copyright

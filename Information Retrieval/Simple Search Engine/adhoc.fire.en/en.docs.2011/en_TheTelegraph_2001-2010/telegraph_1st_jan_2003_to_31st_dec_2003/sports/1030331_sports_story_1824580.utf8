 Qamar fights his way to gold
New Delhi: Commonwealth Games gold medallist Mohammed Ali Qamar of Railways survived a stiff challenge from Services Khimanand Belwal before winning the light fly weight gold in the 48th national boxing championships on Sunday. Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) won the overall title accumulating 63 points to beat Railways Sports Promotion Board (RSPB), who finished second with 54 points. Haryana came third with 21 points. In a bout that went the distance, Qamar won on points 23-20. Qamar was also declared the best boxer of the tournament. Light heavy weight boxer Gurmel Singh of Services, who lost to eventual winner Harpreet Singh (RSPB) in the quarters, was declared the best loser. However, Commonwealth Games silver medallist Som Bahadur Pun and bronze medallist Jitender Kumar were too hot for their rivals to handle. Pun, representing Services, outclassed Andhra Pradeshs D. Manikandan to win the feather weight title with a 26-7 verdict in the final. Railways Kumar forced the referee to stop the contest in less than 25 seconds as he floored Gurbinder Singh of Services in the heavy weight category final. In the super heavy weight final, international boxer V. Johnson of Services beat Shakti Singh of Railways with an RSC verdict in the third round.  Services Ramanand won the light weight title with a similar RSC in the third round over Haryanas Pawan Kumar.  (PTI)  Copyright

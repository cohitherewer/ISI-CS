		 Wednesday, September 10, 2003  Shatin gets 70m display screen 
 BY HONKY DORY								One has heard of 36-inch TV screens or, for that matter, even ones double the size. But what about a screen 4,521 inches big? The Hong Kong Jockeys Club, it is learnt, has installed one such giant diamond vision wide screen last week at the Shatin race course.				 										The width of the screen may be easily compared to the length of a Boeing 747 aircraft. The screen is 70.4m wide and 8m high, therefore, becoming a nightmare for jockeys deciding to go easy in a race, leave along fixing one.				 										The high resolution screen displays pictures from six different angles, and thus there is little possibility of a smart operator playing foul or hoodwinking the probing eyes of race observers and officials.				 										The Guiness book of World Records has already certified it as the biggest screen ever.				 										Meanwhile, a source in the RWITC, Mumbai, informed that the Turf Authorities of India (TAI) has signed a good neighbour treaty last week with their Asian counterparts. The TAI was represented by its chairman Cyrus Poonawalla in the meeting held in Australia.				 										The other turf clubs to have signed the treaty were Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Australia, Turkey and New Zealand.

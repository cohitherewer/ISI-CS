The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sport
		 Sunday, November 23, 2003  IN THE CITY
				 																																																	 The East Bengal players have expressed full confidence in Subhas Bhowmick and vowed to turn things around in the ensuing National League. The clubs top brass had an open session on Saturday with the players and the coach after morning practice to discuss the teams recent slump in form.				 																																																	It was a very democratic discussion where everyone was free to express his views, said club president Dr Pranab Dasgupta. The players were 100 per cent sure there is no cause to panic. They did mention that their payments are sometimes getting delayed and I promised to look into it. They all got their cheques today anyway.				 																																																	Bhaichung Bhutia requested the officials to stand by players at this critical time. 				 																																																	 With monsoon rains lashing the city till late October, preparation of pitches has taken a beating. The CAB has thus been forced to push back the launch of the local season by about a week. The CAB League is now expected to start in the first week of December.				 																																																	 Burdwan beat Police AC to qualify for the mens quarter finals of the senior state basketball meet. Despite the loss, the police team made it to the last eight, as did BTA, Rakhi Sangha, Calcutta Port Trust and Eastern Railway. In womens event, Rangers, BBYS, Calcutta Good Counsel and Chhatra Samity moved into the last eight.				 																																																	RESULTS: Men: Burdwan Dist bt Police AC 62-54; Chhatra Samity bt Visva Bharati 76-65; BTA bt Rakhi Sangha 74-43; CPT bt YMCA 73-47. Women: Rangers bt 24 Parganas 38-16; Chhatra Samity bt Barisha AC 57-44; BBYS bt St Xaviers 35-27.				 																																																	TABLE TENNIS: East Zone national ranking meet: Finals at SAI from 3 pm.				 																																																	BASKETBALL: State meet: Quarter finals at WBBA from 2.30 pm.

		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 IN THE WAR AGAINST GRAFT
 Srinjay Chakravarti The cross-border anti-corruption  treaty signed by about 100 nations in mid-December 2003  is a milestone in the long-drawn battle against global corruption.  India has also extended its support to the convention against  corruption, organized under the aegis of the United Nations.  The treaty explicitly recognizes that in order to combat  poverty at the grassroots level, the looting of public funds  has to be stopped. And now.																								The primary goal of the anti-graft treaty is to recover public funds embezzled by politicians and stashed away in foreign banks and to extradite fugitive officials. Mexico and Nigeria, where billions of dollars have been looted by leaders and officials, have pushed hard for this treaty. They wished to recover their assets from bank accounts in Switzerland and other safe havens. 																								Sani Abacha, who ruled Nigeria with an iron hand from 1993 to 1998, alone had billions of dollars in accounts in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. Jersey has already returned $149 million to Nigeria while Switzerland has promised to repatriate some $640 million. This amount was frozen after it was proved that the Swiss banks had accepted payments from Abacha before he died in 1998.																								The treaty seeks to criminalize bribery, money-laundering and embezzlement of public funds. Signatory nations will also be required to take preventive steps against corruption, not just prosecute offenders. The only drawback is that there is no provision to penalize countries that do not enforce anti-graft laws. Besides, the basic treaty will come into force only in 2006, after at least 30 countries have ratified it. Despite all this, this treaty is definitely a step in the right direction. Rob the poor																								As the Mexican president, Vincente Fox, said, Strengthening the fight against corruption is to strengthen our fight against poverty. Arguing that corruption is a regressive tax  it steals from the needy to enrich the wealthy  the US attorney-general, John Ashcroft, added another dimension to the debate.																								The UN has been at the forefront of the war to recover scam-tainted monies. An anti-graft treaty was first proposed at an international conference on financing and development at Monterrey in 2002 , envisaged as a convention against corruption in all aspects, including the question of repatriation of funds illicitly acquired to countries of origin. 																								The UN has recognized the skewed nature of financial transfers between the Third World and the West. As the UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, recently pointed out, money was still flowing from less developed countries to richer nations for the sixth successive year. Developing countries made a net transfer of $200 billion in financial resources to other countries in 2002  the largest amount ever, which Annan said, defied common sense, since, Funds should be moving from developed countries to developing countries. Public offence																								This is primarily owing to the embezzlement of funds and corruption by politicians and public officials in poorer countries. While tinpot dictators like Nigerias Abacha are the worst offenders, democracies like India, too, have their share of criminals in high places. The most recent case was that of the former Punjab chief minister, Parkash Singh Badal, who allegedly amassed properties in the name of his son, wife and three others, to the tune of Rs 4,326 crore, of which Rs 3,825 crore was stashed abroad. This information was obtained by the Punjab vigilance bureau from official agencies in Australia, Canada and the US. But in order to bring home such charges of assets disproportionate to sources of income, an Indian court needs to issue an order to courts abroad.																								It is here that this treaty will be important. If stolen money can actually be brought back from overseas bank accounts, it would become much easier to implement development projects without resorting to deficit financing.

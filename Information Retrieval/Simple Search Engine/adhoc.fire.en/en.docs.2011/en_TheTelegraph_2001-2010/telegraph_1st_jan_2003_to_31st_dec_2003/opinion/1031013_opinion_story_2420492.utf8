 - Developing countries now sustain the lifestyle of rich nations  S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India The richer countries of the world,  like the United States of America and the European Union,  have undergone a reversal of roles. They are increasingly  dependent on the developing countries to sustain their living  standards. The growing current account surpluses of China,  Japan, Taiwan and India have led to booming foreign exchange  reserves of these countries, which are invested in gilts  and other securities of the richer West.Yet in spite of  this magnificent support to the global economy, Asia is  at the receiving end of criticism and pressure from the  richer countries. The secretary of the US treasury,  John Snow, had a particularly unedifying visit to China  early in September 2003, when he tried to pressure China  to revalue its currency, the remninbi, so as to make its  exports less attractive and thus favour US manufacturers  of competing goods. This was quite a change from the usual  pattern wherein the US complains that the developing countries  should devalue their currencies. But the US has today a  large current account deficit, which can be cured, if at  all, by a sharp devaluation of the greenback. Already, the  greenback is devaluing against the euro. The US needs to  get a larger effective devaluation by getting other currencies  revalued. Strange logic, but the might of the rich appears  strong, even when their balance sheets look weak. The Bretton Woods twins also added  their voice to the USs plea for revaluation of Chinese  currency. At its recent meeting at Dubai, the World Bank  and the International Monetary Fund lent their support to  the plea that China should let its currency float and its  value be determined by market prices. The fact that China  does not have a strong financial system and that revaluation  of the remninbi might hurt its exporters and hence the banks,  was lost sight of. The Bretton Woods twins plea for market  forces is short-hand for asking them not to intervene in  the markets and buy up the surplus dollars. But the central  banks of Asia will find it difficult to prevent their currencies  from devaluing if the flood of dollars is left to determine  the exchange rate. Intervention and build-up of forex reserves  are a necessary part of Asian central bankers management  of the abundance of riches, which their countries face. It is a pity that the immediate  pressure of US electoral politics has found its echo in  the Bretton Woods twins support of the USs stand. The  economic reality is that Chinas massive exports into the  US have led to a loss of jobs in the USs manufacturing  sector. Its corporate organizations think on protectionist  lines and feel that China should revalue its currency so  as to make its exports costlier in terms of the US dollar.  China has been maintaining a steady exchange rate against  the US dollar since 1994. The Chinese authorities buy up  the excess dollars and this cheapens the Chinese currency.  In effect, China is doing today what Japan did in its earlier  phase of development, keeping its currency cheap to help  promote exports. The US resents Chinas success as an exporter  and hectors China to change its policy. China has politely  refused, pointing out that its financial institutions are  weak and a stronger Chinese currency or a float of the remninbi  will bankrupt many of its industries and throw its banks  into chaos. In all these pressure tactics,  the US has not recognized the role that Chinas (and Asias)  reserves play in sustaining its own economy. The investment  of most of the surplus reserves of Asia, of nearly $1,600  billion in USs gilt-edged securities, is a support to the  US economy. Asia is pulling its weight and the US is not  left to carry out its adjustment all by itself. In fact, but for Asias central  banks investing their reserves in US government securities,  the US would have found it difficult to manage its deficit.  It would have had to make a heavier drawal on its own peoples  savings and its interest rates would have risen. It is wrong  to say that the world economy is not getting adequate support  from Asia. On the contrary, Asia is sustaining the USs  spending splurge  both its military adventurism and its  consumer spending. It is a reflection of the changing  power structure of global economies that today the countries  of Asia own 70 per cent of the global reserves of foreign  exchange, as against 30 per cent in 1990 and 20 per cent  in the early Seventies. Of course, Asia may suddenly withdraw  this support, which will land the US in deep distress. The  geopolitical situation is, however, such that this may not  happen. Asia can threaten, but not implement its option  of withdrawing reserves from the US financial markets. That  there is no safe financial alternative is very pertinent.  Unless Asia develops its own credible bond markets, it is  forced to invest its surpluses in financing the USs deficits,  both external account and domestic. This is not a sustainable  situation for all time. It is necessary that Asian nations  recognize their power and use it first for the greater good  of Asias own people, instead of building houses, maintaining  roads and financing the military build-up of richer countries   which borrow to the hilt. The US is shortsighted in trying  to get China to lose its competitive edge by revaluing the  remninbi. The provenance of US multinational companies in  China is shown by the fact  recently cited by Morgan Stanley   that upto $1,000 billion of the USs market capitalization  belongs to US multinational corporations, who have a manufacturing  base in China for exports to their parent country. The USs  efforts to render China less competitive will ultimately  hurt its own MNCs, although they will be different from  the corporate organizations which manufacture inside the  US to sell there. Anyway, the US should beware lest China  listens to its advice and revalues the remninbi. It might  eventually hurt Wall Street more than the US can find tolerable. Exchange markets are complicated  because of their interdependence. The advice given by the  rich nations to the relatively poor to revalue their  currencies flies in the face of economic reality, although  temporarily it might help Snow score a political victory  in the polls. It is sad that in its pursuit of narrow national  interests, the US is forgetting the larger implications  of exchange rate management and the interdependence of markets. Incidentally, Snow may perhaps  do a lot of good to Chinas Asian competitors, if he succeeds  in his campaign. Chinas competitors in Asia have been feeling  the brunt of the giants pricing power. If Snow succeeds  in his campaign, he may help the little Tigers of Asia in  their competition with China  an unintended consequence  of his eager fight for Chinas revaluation. The USs pursuit of global economic  diplomacy shows that its national interests are supreme.  China has deflected the attack for the present. Chinas  response to the pressures of the US and the Bretton Woods  twins should help us in India to mould our attitude in case  the US turns its benign attention to our currency and  our exchange rates. For the present, we are no more than  a blip on the USs radar screen  except for back office  processing, which has enraged sundry US legislators. But  our success as a manufacturer exporter will mean the US  will try its China tactics on India as well. We should  form a compact with China to fend off pressures by US interests  to force us to revalue our currency. Already, our exporters are complaining  that the rupee is too strong for their good. The pressure  from the USs economic gurus should not force us to abandon  our current policy of containing the rise in the value of  the rupee. India and China should together fight this battle.  Their interests are common and their concerns genuinely  shared. The USs currency wars should be fought by both  India and China with diplomacy and economic counter-attack,  but above all, we should use persuasion. Ultimately, the  US cannot fail to recognize that Indias reserves do help  to sustain its own economic architecture. It would hurt  the US to destroy a contributor to its seemingly endless  appetite for a cornucopia of riches. It is, indeed, paradoxical that  the richest country of the world depends on contributions  from the poorer to sustain its march to greater glory. Earlier  episodes of imperialism saw tributes paid by poorer nations  to the rich by force. Today, the channels of commerce  and finance work in devious ways to extract the same tribute.  The USs efforts to alter the terms of finance by revaluing  the Chinese currency are in its self-interest, but it does  not seem to realize that Chinas success holds a key to  the USs sustenance in the midst of huge gaps in its external  and domestic finance.

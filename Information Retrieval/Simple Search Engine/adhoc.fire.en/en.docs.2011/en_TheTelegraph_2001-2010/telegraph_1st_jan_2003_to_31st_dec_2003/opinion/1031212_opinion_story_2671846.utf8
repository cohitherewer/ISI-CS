The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, December 12, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Men in cohorts				 																																																				Sir  What is shocking about the report, Coke seeks to cap Sen storm (Dec 10), is not that someone like Sushmita Sen was a victim of sexual harassment, but that it says nothing about the fate of Sripad Nadkarni, against whom the charges were made. Does that mean that he still works for Coke? If that were so, the company is willy nilly colluding in the crime by continuing to employ him. Does Coke India fear that by sacking Nadkarni it would be giving credence to the charges? Then why are the charges being investigated by someone of the stature of a former chief justice of India? There is something about cases of sexual harassment in the workplace that bring out the entrenched bias against women in the largely male top management of companies. Even Infosys, which takes its social responsbilities seriously, preferred to pay up and ask no questions in the Phaneesh Murthy case. A Sushmita Sen might get paid Rs 1.45 crore, but any other plain Sen would have got the sack.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Jamini Sen, Calcutta
				 																Shopping for war				 																																																				Sir  I was not sure whether to laugh out loud or cry on learning that the Admiral Gorshkov deal had run into yet another stumbling block. The news report, Gorshkov sinks navys pride (Dec 4), raises several questions. One, how could the naval chief issue a statement saying that the deal had been clinched and two, what does it say of the media which flashed the news without first checking the facts? If the price negotiations had been completed in a comprehensive manner, as the defence spokesperson claims, why is Moscow reluctant to endorse it? The entire episode is shocking as it involves two responsible nations and not roadside shoppers haggling over prices. Lets hope the differences are minor, as New Delhi claims, and are sorted out soon. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  The Gorshkov should be equipped with a formidable multi-tier surface-to-air missile combination to defeat the full spectrum of air threats  from low-flying strike aircraft to sea-skimming anti-ship missiles fired from strike aircraft and submerged submarines. Since the large European missile manufacturer, MBDA, now has a close cooperation with the Indian defence industry, it may make sense to go in for the MBDAs Principal Air-to-Air Missile System, which has a vertical-launcher and uses Aster 15 (short-range) and Aster 30 (long-range) missiles. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sayan Majumdar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Whether India does acquire the Admiral Gorshkov or not, India must be proud of its indigenous ship-building capabilities. And for all the criticism directed at V.K. Krishna Menon, we must thank him and Jawaharlal Nehru for this. The first Leander class frigate may have taken our designers over a decade to bring out, but we followed it up with six more in the next 15 years. Indira Gandhi laid the first keel of our submarine in 1984 and if there had not been irresponsible opposition to the HDW designs, we would have been in the export market today. I once heard a Royal Navy officer commenting on the excellent quality of the Mazgaon Dockyards-built INS Nilgiri. And he should know  the British have been building sophisticated ships for over two centuries. India, of course, went on to improve on many original British concepts, besides fitting them with Soviet weaponry. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mukund B. Kunte, New Delhi

				 																Ban on good sense				 																																																				Sir  The intentions of the ministry of information and broadcasting and the censor board may be good. But in a democracy, it is a violation of peoples right to choose what they see and to think for themselves. People who do not like something can turn the TV off or switch channels. 				 																																																				Perhaps Ravi Shankar Prasad is justified in believing that citizens cannot be left to decide what to watch on television; it must have been such lack of wisdom on the part of voters that got him elected. Anupam Kher, with his patronizing belief that parents cannot raise children well without his intervention, and Sushma Swaraj, who is the principal opponent of that crime called thought in India, should read George Orwells 1984  if they havent already banned it, citing national security. It might give them an idea of where they are headed. What scares me is that they may well like the idea of such arbitrary power in their hands. 				 																																																				But those are my rights they are violating. I pay for my cable services and I decide what to watch and what not to. I dont think my watching TV can do as much harm as these people do, with their pre-conceived notions. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Pranay Kumar, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  It is asinine of the government to try to act as a culture police and censor adult content on private channels (Puritans progess, Dec 3). Had the government been serious about promoting good culture through TV, it would not have allowed the quality of the fare to deteriorate. The Sunday afternoon slot for award-winning films on Doordarshan was moved to midnight so that few watch these films any longer. 				 																																																				Earlier there was Sushma Swaraj who was dead set against Fashion TVs being shown in India, but went to Cannes to promote Indian films with a package of Raj Kapoor films. The hidden agenda seems to be to promote Bollywood, most of which is suitable only for a regressive society. It is time Indians were allowed to view mature content. Anyone who isnt interested can always reach for the remote.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhajit Ghosh, Shillong

				 																																																				Sir  The information and broadcasting ministry has, thankfully, spoken out against channels like Trendz and FTV, which have been inflicted on the Indian viewers. These channels have been successful not because they are the only outlets for the fashion industry in India. If one watched these channels, it was not for Indian fashion (which is rarely shown), it was solely for the topless women. 				 																																																				I certainly dont need to watch half-naked people walking arrogantly in outrageously improper clothes, and I am sure neither do most Indian viewers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kushal Poddar, Calcutta

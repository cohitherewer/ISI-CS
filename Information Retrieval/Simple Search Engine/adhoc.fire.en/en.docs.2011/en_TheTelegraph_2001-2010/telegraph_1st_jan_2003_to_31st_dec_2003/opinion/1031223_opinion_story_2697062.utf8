		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 TRIALS OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
 GWYNNE DYER																								Colonel James Hickey, commander of the American forces that took the former Iraqi leader prisoner on December 14 , said (Saddam Hussein) was wise not to wait too long. We were about to clear that (underground facility) in a military sort of way, he added, explaining that things like that are cleared with hand grenades, small arms, things like that. But Hickeys orders were to capture or kill Saddam, and the latter managed to get his hands up in time.																								The Bush administration is probably wishing quite hard by now that Saddam had waited a little longer and been killed in his hole. While others debate where he should be tried and by whom, and whether he should face the death penalty or not, Bushs people will be realizing that they cannot afford to give him a fair trial at all.																								He would certainly be convicted in the end: the evidence of Saddams crimes over the years is overwhelming. But in a fair trial, with normal rules of evidence and competent defence lawyers, it would be impossible to stop the defence from pointing out that every administration of the United States of America from 1980 to 1992 (all Republican ones, as it happens) was directly or indirectly complicit in his crimes. Mastermind America																								Saddams career includes three great crimes: the use of poison gas against Iranian troops during the 1980-88 war; the slaughter of rebellious Iraqi Kurds towards the end of that war and just afterwards (again involving the use of poison gas); and the massacres of Kurds and Shia Arabs who rebelled against his rule after the Kuwait war of 1991. After that, his misdeeds fall back to a more mundane level.																								US involvement with Saddams regime began in 1983, when his ill-advised invasion of Iran had backfired spectacularly and Iraq was facing defeat at the hands of Ayatollah Khomeinis radically anti-American regime in Iran. The US knew that Saddam was already illegally using chemical weapons against Iranian troops almost daily, but in December, 1983, the Reagan administration sent Donald Rumsfeld to Baghdad to tell Saddam that it was willing to help and wanted to restore full diplomatic relations.																								In the following years, the US government allowed vital ingredients for chemical weapons to be exported to Iraq, together with dozens of biological agents, including anthrax. It also supplied Iraq with intelligence information on Iranian troop movements and positions, and from 1986 even sent US air force officers to help interpret US-supplied satellite and aerial photos to plan attacks against Iran  in which it was clearly understood by Washington that huge quantities of poison gas would be used. Guantanamo revisited																								The Reagan administration used its influence to kill a Senate bill banning the export of US military technology to Iraq to punish Saddam for using chemical weapons against Iran. When Saddam used poison gas against his own Kurdish population at Halabja in 1988, killing 6,800 innocent people, US diplomats were instructed to blame it on Iran. All this would come out in gory detail if Saddam ever got a fair and public trial.																								The third great crime of the Saddam years was the massacre of rebellious Shia Arabs and of Kurds after Saddams defeat in the 1991 war. These occurred because the senior Bush urged the Iraqi population to revolt against Saddam  but when they did, he withheld military support, even allowing Saddams helicopter gunships to range freely over the rebellious areas. It was not complicity, but at least carelessness.																								This is why there will probably be no public trial at all. It has already become clear that the ousted Iraqi leader, contrary to Washingtons first statements, will not be treated as a prisoner of war. Instead, he will be assigned to the same legal limbo shared by the hundreds who have been imprisoned in Guantanamo for the past two years, suffering perpetual interrogation, unprotected by the Geneva conventions and beyond the reach of any national law, including that of the US.																								Nobody at Guantanamo has yet been brought to trial. Saddams fate will be no different.

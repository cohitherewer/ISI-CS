		 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 ON THE DEFENSIVE
																								Perfect justice is never easy to achieve or implement in the confusing turmoil of life. And to determine whether violence has occurred in self-defence is extremely difficult once the moment of violence has passed. The Supreme Courts judgment that self-defence may provide adequate justification for killing, therefore, demands great care and discrimination in its application. In every way, the judgment is forward-looking, because it provides the necessary protection for the ordinary citizen who, now more than ever, feels open to the depredations of criminals. At the same time, the case that gave rise to the judgment must also be given careful attention. Mr Xavier Martin and his son had been charged with murder after they opened fire on a mob which attacked them for not closing their bread factory during the Bharat bandh in March, 1998. The court acquitted them of the charge of murder, saying that there is legal sanctity for self-defence even if it results in death, because the right of self-defence is a recognized right. 																								The immediate context of this case, then, comprised a bandh, and an aggressive mob out to cause mischief, damage and violence. The Supreme Court had stated in an earlier series of rulings that nobody has the right to protest in a way that causes others inconvenience, be it through processions, rallies or bandhs, and also that the right to strike work is not a fundamental right. The court is paying special attention to public order, and has said, in this case, that the authorities should discourage such hooliganism with an iron hand. By reiterating the right to self-defence in this context, the court has strengthened its earlier rulings. Besides, in its elucidation, the court has envisaged a moment of hurried confusion in which, confronted by perceived peril, an individual may react violently in self-defence. In other words, signs of premeditation, even if the act be in self-protection, may not be covered by this ruling. In order to ensure caution in application, the court has put the onus of proof of self-defence with the one who has killed. Such a person must establish that the extreme step was justified. Self-defence is a common enough plea in cases of murder. While it is essential to empower the victims of public disorder and deter violence, it is also necessary to prevent preemptive killing. The right to self-defence can be seriously abused unless the administration is perfectly fair-minded in its dispensation.

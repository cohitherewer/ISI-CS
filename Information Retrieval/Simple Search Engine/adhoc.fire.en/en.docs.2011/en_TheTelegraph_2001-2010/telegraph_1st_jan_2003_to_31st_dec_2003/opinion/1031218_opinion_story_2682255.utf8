The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, December 18, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Fetters on freedom				 																																																				Sir  After training their trishuls on noted danseuse, Mallika Sarabhai, the saffronites have found Vijay Tendulkar as their new target. The noted Marathi playwright has earned their wrath for wanting to shoot Narendra Modi (Playwright Tendulkar in BJP gunsight, Dec 13). Tendulkars anger is understandable. As a conscientious Indian citizen, he has been deeply disturbed by the chhote sardars devious schemes in Gujarat. Perhaps, he should have expressed his anguish more eloquently. But the BJPs battle cry betrays a larger conspiracy. Their propaganda against some of Indias most respected artistes reminds us of the Nazi operation against intellectual opposition in Thirties Germany. Following their illustrious German counterparts would be a recipe for disaster in India. Meanwhile, the Indian intelligentsia should unite to counter this disturbing witch-hunt. After all, artistes have the licence to criticize despots.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Barun Sharma, Calcutta 
				 																The general in his labyrinth				 																																																				Sir  Paul Bremer, the American administrator of Iraq, was clearly a much relieved man when he announced in typical Hollywood style, We got him (Tikrit lion pulled out of rat hole, Dec 15). What happened afterwards was a carefully manipulated show  a select group of journalists were seen expressing their exultation at the news. Surely, by now, we must have understood what jargons like the Geneva convention mean. When video images of captured American soldiers appeared on television, Donald Rumsfeld cried foul. Yet the United States of America had no problem circulating pictures of the mutilated bodies of Saddam Husseins sons, Uday and Qusay. 				 																																																				This, in fact, has been the hallmark of the American campaign throughout the year. News have been trimmed or spiced up according to convenience. The naked image of Pax Americana is there for all to see. It is common knowledge that the Central Intelligence Agency has failed to churn up any evidence that shows the presence of the famed weapons of mass destruction. Yet the Yankee troops have turned a desert into a graveyard and left an indelible scar on a whole generation of children. Why? For oil? To cover up the American failure in Afghanistan? Or because a paranoid president wanted to make sure that he was re-elected? The pictures of wild happiness, live from Baghdad, bring a hidden message  the lord has fallen, long live the new lord! Yours faithfully, 
 Indranath Chattopadhyay, Santiniketan 				 																																																				Sir  One-liners like He can run but cant hide, placing a $ 25 million reward on a foreign leader and launching a manhunt in a territory where Americans have no business to be, make a good movie script. But can George W. Bush write off the body bags being flown back from Iraq? He would do well to remember that it is possible to fool some people sometime, but not all people all the time. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anand Khurana, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is Christmas time and a particularly joyous one for the Bush camp. Sunday morning brought the wonderful news of the capture of Saddam Hussein, who even seemed content to be taken prisoner by the Americans unlike his martyr sons. There was even better news on the economic front which showed a fourth quarter growth of more than 4 per cent. Christmas spending is at an all time high and the job market is finally looking up. What more could the president ask for? The change in fortunes could be seen in the presidents speech to the nation  crisp, clear and coherent. The presidents demeanour was of a man sure of himself. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shantanu Shukla, NewYork, US

				 																																																				Sir  I write to congratulate the American troops for capturing Saddam Hussein. Thanks to them, the world is a safer place now. All those who suffered at the hands of this dictator  Muslims, non-Muslims, Shias, Sunnis, pro- and anti-American people  have a reason to celebrate. Saddam Hussein should be brought to book for his crimes. I wish we could have done the same to dictators of the past and present alike. Having said this, I must add that Saddam Hussein must be differentiated from his evil personality. Thus I see no reason for the Americans to use this victory to humiliate the Arabs and Muslims. Also as an American, I strongly feel that the US must get out of Iraq now, before it becomes another Palestine.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shahid Athar, Indianapolis, US

				 																																																				Sir  It seems that the surrender of Saddam Hussein has been brought about by a tacit understanding between the US forces and the former dictator. The fact that a man who has been fighting the Americans for the last 12 years could be captured without any bloodshed is beyond comprehension. The Iraqi dictator may have agreed to surrender on condition that his death sentence is waived by the Americans. The US, on the other hand, had been wanting an honourable exit from Iraq. Now the US should hand him over to the International Court of Justice.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak Kumar Vidhyarthi, Muzaffarnagar

				 																																																				Sir  Indias position throughout the Iraq conflict has been justified because the non-detection of chemical or biological weapons proved that Americas rationale for attacking Iraq was flawed. But now India can follow France and Germany who have joined other nations in congratulating the US. Under the present circumstances, India can also perhaps accept the USs request for troops. One has to remember the USs kind gesture of sending along its commander-in-chief at the funeral of Uday Singh, the jawan recently killed in Iraq fighting for the US. Yours faithfully, 
 Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba 				 																																																				Sir  It would be wise for the US administration to repatriate Saddam Hussein outside Iraq. This would compliment the bloodless nature of his capture.				 																																																				Yours faithfully R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

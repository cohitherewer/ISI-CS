The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 12, 2003  RELAYING THE GROUNDWORK
 Panchayats have given the CPI(M) a  strong foundation, but also let loose unruly elements in its  command structure, writes Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya The author is fellow, Centre for Studies  in Social Sciences, Calcutta		 Collective responsibilityWhat is actually happening in  rural West Bengal in the course of the panchayat  polls? We are getting alarming reports of violence pouring  out of our villages almost everyday, carrying ghastly details  of alleged threats, torture, even murder and rape committed  mainly by the politically powerful entities. It has been  asserted by the opposition parties that their candidates  were stopped from filing nomination for as many as ten thousand  seats, allowing the ruling coalition a virtually free run  in these areas. Even some constituents of the Left Front  have charged the dominant partner of using its muscles to  ward off any possible challenge to its supremacy. In the  vernacular press, the range of such allegations has reached  sensational heights; the media, it would appear, is waging  a moral  if unequal  battle against some form of an absolutist  regime. True, in the thick of an electoral  battle exaggerations and suppression of facts are not new.  It is impossible at the moment to ascertain the veracity  of many of these charges. No hard data can be compiled immediately  that would enable us to compare the number  and especially  the kind  of seats going uncontested this year with the  figures of the previous elections. Similarly, a detailed  list of seats where the partners of the ruling front are  fighting each other in violation of the agreed principles  of seat allocation and who is to be blamed in most cases  for such violations is yet to be established. Also, the  circumstances and the actual scenario leading to such acts  of violence will require a closer scrutiny than available  in the initial  and somewhat erratic  newspaper and television  reports. Amidst all this, theres no denying that what is  new in the panchayat polls this time round is the high decibel  of publicity it is getting from all quarters, local and  national. For someone who has been observing  the trajectory of the panchayats in the state, this is however  hardly surprising. Once mere institutions to carry out land  reforms by way of putting organized pressure on the landed  classes and the lower rung of bureaucracy, panchayats soon  turned into some form of a defining mechanism for the village  localities. From governing the localities at the behest  of the higher levels of authority, there was a clear tendency  of becoming a government by the locality itself. Not that  everyone was invited, not that all forms of exclusion based  on caste, class, gender, or political affiliations were  erased, but in this new mode of deciding what is good and  bad, and what is needed and dispensable for the village,  the panchayat assumed a centrality not just in allocating  Central and state funds and implementing employment generating  programmes. There is much more. Its centrality came from  its largely representative character, collective decision-making,  intervention in all kinds of village problems, and offering  of the most proximate legal-institutional edifice that simultaneously  kept itself open to the local sensibilities of entitlement.  This gave the panchayat a significant ethical potency. Those  who dealt endlessly in corruption in the panchayat  though  with the right intentions  seldom appreciated that many  such corruptions were viewed significantly in a different  light in particular villages. Let me give two examples. A recent  survey asked rural respondents if they thought the partisan  disbursement of funds (shwajanposhan) by the panchayat  functionaries was bad. A majority said it wasnt. Why? Because  it is immoral not to look after your own people. Second,  during a fieldwork I asked villagers why they did not react  despite knowing that money meant for repairing the arterial  village road has been siphoned off by the panchayat? Why  should they, I was asked in return, when they knew that  the money would after all be spent for a bhalo kaaj  (desirable purpose) in the village itself?  This is not a point in cultural  relativism, of a differential menu of priorities that are  incommensurable with the rational mindsets of the policy-makers  at the top. Rather, these are instances of a situational  thinking about how best the local government should work.  You change the location, and any strictly uniform notion  of good governance seems hollow. What appears striking in West  Bengal is the fusion of the party and the government at  the local level. Whether it is the party that has made a  deft instrumental use of the panchayat or whether the panchayat  owes much of its success to the organizational qualities  of a well-knit party can be a debating point. But the most  pressing effect of this fusion is the growth of an imagination  of local governance with the organizational grid of mainly  the Communist Party of India (Marxist) set permanently at  the centre. Of course there are non-CPI(M) village panchayat  bodies, as well as other left and non-left political parties  and their mass organizations, but the presence of the party  is so overwhelming, especially as one climbs up the panchayat  hierarchy, that every action that requires mediation by  the panchayat becomes unlikely to succeed unless it is routed  at some level through this partisan machinery. This can  perhaps be taken as a vital clue to the Left Fronts incredibly  long spell in power which others have envied but scarcely  been able  for different reasons  to emulate. Such a massive network of political  and administrative resources indeed provides the dominant  partner in the coalition with a strong and enduring foundation.  Paradoxically, however, it also simultaneously releases  an unruly element in its command and control structures.  Each village, each locality, with the aid of governmental  institutions associated with it, generates locally specific  problems that calls for some degree of locally specific  solutions. There cannot be a single way to conduct the affairs  of the party anymore; everyday issues need pragmatic immediate  action. This in turn makes it necessary for local party  leaders to have a good deal of political reflex, ability  to make imaginative interventions and to act independently  within the local government. The final test of their conduct,  they are categorically reminded, is in the electoral outcome.  So the violence we are witnessing is perhaps not so much  because the CPI(M) is losing its grip over its local units,  as has been widely suggested in the media. The grip, in  fact, is predicated on an allowance of some unencumbered  manoeuvrings at the distant, local levels. But the problem  is that winning elections has become the litmus test for  the local leadership, the most important credential for  its authority within the organization. So electoral battles,  especially the local ones, are increasingly turning into  a question of life and death. In recent times, the panchayat  is expected to play a new role. The situation at the ground  level in rural West Bengal has undergone tremendous changes.  Through the early Nineties the state has had unprecedented  growth in the production of paddy, potato and certain other  crops. Vast stretches of land have been brought under the  cover of irrigation, wages for agricultural workers have  gone up, and the general level and pattern of consumption  of a vast segment of rural population, by all estimates,  have grown and diversified. This has also been accompanied  by a demand for the right prices, for enlarged markets,  for sustainable agriculture, more efficient productive techniques  and better use of inputs such as seeds, water, pesticides,  fertilizers and so on.  Most of these issues require professional  assistance such as scientific expertise, infrastructure  such as roads, better modes of transportation. So the panchayat,  which so far was pressed into harnessing localities, must  now be equipped to transcend them. Both the recommendations  of global consultants McKinsey and the new agricultural  policies of the present government make strong cases for  placing the states system of rural production within a  globalized economy. Land, after the initial bout of distributive  reforms, has ceased to be a major issue here; now the left  is busy selling the idea of precision farming to get rid  of the glut of overproduction of certain crops and to boost  agro- processing. So the stakes, by all means, are  really high. Gone are the days when rural West Bengal portrayed  a rather monochromatic image of hunger, indebtedness, landlessness,  indignity and excruciating poverty. Despite its bad roads,  dilapidated schools and badly equipped health centres, village  Bengal is likely to turn soon into a destination for sizeable  private investment, both global and local. From the CPI(M)s  point of view, it is best suited  given its organizational  prowess  to invite these changes in the right measure.  But are we to witness these promises of prosperity finding  fulfilment in a manipulative ambience of incessant violence?  Or will a more tolerant, reciprocal and dialogical relationship  between contenders of political power prevail in the aftermath  of the panchayat polls? Whatever happens, it will indeed  add colour to the troubled intimacy between democracy and  development in our part of the world.

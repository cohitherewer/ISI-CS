The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, August 22, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Some gifted men, women and a boy Lois the Witch (Hesperus,   2.95) by Elizabeth Gaskell exhibits to the  full the authors magic gifts of story-telling, as well  as her deep commitment to the truths, agonies and cruelties  of human experience. These attributes endeared her to her  more famous contemporary, Charles Dickens, for whose periodicals  she wrote regularly. The story of Lois is more the unfolding  of ignorance, fear, blindness and selfishness than an account  of fantastic experiences. Gaskells powerful grasp of psychology  and her interest in history, sociology and, in this particular  case, the Salem witch trials, make Loiss story a triumph  of shorter fiction.  Across the great divide: the  band and America (Pimlico, 7.95) by Barney  Hoskyns tells the story of the growth of a strange group  of four Canadians and a boy from Arkansas into The Band,  called by George Harrison the best band in the history  of the universe. A meticulous and loving record, the book  is enriched by Hoskynss obvious enjoyment of his subject.  It is almost as if the vibrancy of The Bands music is echoed  by the authors lively style. This does not diminish the  seriousness of Hoskynss judgments which help in assessing  and locating this extraordinary group whose first two albums  changed the course of rock music in America. It is not just  Richard Manuel, Levon Helm and Rick Danko who figure in  the book, but also the whole world of American rock, soul  and country, jazz and gospel, Dylan Thomas, Billy Graham,  Janis Joplin and U2  that is also the world of The Band. The Indus Civilization: a contemporary  perspective Vistaar, Rs 495)by Gregory L.  Possehl brings together the most recent findings on  the Indus civilization and presents them in an accessible  form. Graphs, maps, diagrams, plans and illustrations make  the book invaluable for the understanding of even the interested  layman, while for the scholar this is a useful reference  guide. Possehl, one of the best known Indus scholars from  America, has carefully distributed the available material  on the economic, architectural, social, aesthetic and religious  aspects of the lost civilization among chapters and sub-sections,  while tracing the rise and fall of this culture straddling  the borders of what are now India and Pakistan. Ambrosia for afters (Penguin,  Rs 250) by Kalpana Swaminathan is a growing-up  tale, inwoven with strange memories and retellings of fairy  tales heard in childhood. How a fifteen-year-old negotiates  the perilous region between reason and imagination, reality  and fantasy, growing-up and running-backwards, is always  a bit of a mystery, and trying to tell it as it is is quite  an unnerving task. Swaminathan attempts to solve the problem  with an approach through fairy-tales, having honed her touch  with a number of books for children. But it is as much an  adults tale as a teenagers, because the uncertainly mediated  world that the fifteen-year-old responds to is very much  an adult world.Fanie De Villers: Portrait  of a test bowler (Penguin, Rs 450) by Trevor  Chesterfield is the biography of the South African quick  who was christened Petrus Stephanus de Villiers. The book  comes at a time when South Africa has more or less lost  its place as a team which can give Australians a run for  their money. De Villiers, who started off in rugby and javelin  throwing before making up the fearsome opening attack with  Alan Donald, was among the few who in the true sense of  the term helped South African cricket come back after its  isolation for over two decades. He has worked relentlessly  to promote the game among the less privileged sections.  What will be of great interest to readers is de Villierss  no-holds-barred views on Hansie Cronje: I believe South  African cricket has paid the price for allowing Hansie too  much power.

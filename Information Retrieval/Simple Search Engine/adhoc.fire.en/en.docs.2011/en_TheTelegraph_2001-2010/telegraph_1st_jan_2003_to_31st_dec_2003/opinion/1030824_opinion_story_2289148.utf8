The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 24, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Unhealthy sympathy				 																																																				Sir  Even before doctors have committed themselves to something definite about the tennis stars brain condition, the media are full of speculative reports about Leander Paess chances of recovery (Leander in US hospital with brain lesion, August 21). We seem to have already killed the cat with our unhealthy curiosity and overwhelming sympathy for a sportsman who has hardly any need of it. Yes, Paess fans and well-wishers might be wanting all the information available, and it is the medias duty to provide it. But lets hold back our sympathies, friends and foes alike, for now.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, J. Acharya, Calcutta
				 																Strike back				 																																																				Sir  Never mind repeated Supreme Court directives on bandh, work culture in West Bengal continues its downward slide. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had once made a great show of spurring on his workers in the state with a Do it now. The sermon has, quite evidently, failed to work wonders. Leftist unions and organizations continue to call bandh at the drop of a hat. Does the left realize what such frequent strikes are doing to the image of the state? If the chief minister has dreams of inviting industries from Europe, he should have something concrete to offer to them other than strikes. Little wonder Gucci backtracked after showing an initial enthusiasm to send its study team.				 																																																				What surprised about the August 21 bandh called by the Socialist Unity Centre of India most is that it went largely unopposed by other parties. On its part, the Left Front government keeps back workers at its offices if it wishes to prove a bandh has been unsuccessful. Why shouldnt it do the same for all strikes? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  We have passed through another day of bandh and the same old claims have been made at the end of the day. Provash Ghosh of SUCI congratulated the people for making the 24-hour strike a success and the Left Front chairman, Biman Bose, for its failure. It is an undeniable fact that SUCI and Communist Party of India (Marxist Leninist-Liberation) have frail organizations in the state, particularly in comparison with other parties, like the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Trinamool Congress and the Congress who dare to call bandh. In proportion to their strength in the state, the SUCI bandh was astonishingly successful. Can the Bharatiya Janata Party minus the Trinamool give the state such a complete bandh?				 																																																				Yours faithfully																															
Abhijit Datta, Howrah

				 																																																				Sir  Although I am totally against the bandh culture, I find it difficult to resist myself from congratulating SUCI, which has only two MLAs in West Bengal, for enforcing an almost complete bandh in Calcutta. SUCI seems to be the only party which has a genuine concern for the people. The way it organizes protests every time there is a hike in electricity tariff or rise in taxes is commendable. The party has dedicated members who never indulge in misbehaviour nor demand any money forcibly from anyone. The way they underwent torture at the hands of the police this time only doubled my respect for it.  Yours faithfully, 
 Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 				 																What about us?				 																																																				Sir  The recent judgment of the Supreme Court on capitation fee has created insurmountable problems for parents and their wards. My son has already been admitted to an engineering college in Karnataka through the common entrance test. But such admissions may be cancelled following the judgment. 				 																																																				Unfortunately, my son has already taken migration certificate from West Bengal and there is no scope of his admission anywhere else. My child will not only lose one year, but he will also face a stupendous problem as he has left the state. Taking the CET was trouble enough, followed by counselling and so on from a distant place. The college authorities should be directed by the courts of law to acccept students who have already been admitted this year.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sudarshan Nandi, Rangamati, Midnapore

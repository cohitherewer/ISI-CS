 															- Document  Extracts from the Human Devlopment Report  2003, published by the United Nations Development Programme				 	 Damage control																								Goal links to the environment  Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger: Poor peoples livelihoods and food security often depend on ecosystem goods and services. Poor people tend to have insecure rights to environmental resources and inadequate access to markets, decision-making and environmental information  limiting their capability to protect the environment and improve their livelihoods and wellbeing. Lack of access to energy services also limits productive opportunities, especially in rural areas;																								Achieve universal primary education: Time spent collecting water and fuel wood reduces time available for schooling. In addition, the lack of energy, water and sanitation services in rural areas discourages qualified teachers from working in poor villages; Promote gender equality: Women and girls are especially burdened by water and fuel collection, reducing their time and opportunities for education, literacy and income-generating activities. Women often have unequal rights and insecure access to land and other natural resources, limiting their opportunities and ability to access other productive assets; 																								Reduce child mortality: Diseases tied to unclean water and inadequate sanitation and respiratory infections related to pollution are among the leading killers of children under five. Lack of fuel for boiling water also contributes to preventable waterborne diseases; Improve maternal health: Inhaling polluted indoor air and carrying heavy loads of water and fuel wood hurt womens health and can make them less fit to bear children...And lack of energy for illumination and refrigeration, as well as inadequate sanitation, undermine health care...;																								Combat major diseases: Up to 20 per cent of the disease burden in developing countries may be due to environmental risk factors (as with malaria and parasitic infections). Preventive measures to reduce such hazards are as important as treatment  and often more cost-effective; Develop a global partnership: Many global environmental problems...can be solved only through partnerships between rich and poor countries. In addition, predatory investments in natural resources can greatly increase pressure to overexploit environmental assets in poor countries.																								Policy interventions to address natural resource scarcity for the worlds poor people-and to reverse environmental damage from overconsumption in rich countries must take into account the diversity of the natural environment, the many and varying causes of environmental degradation and the complex links between poverty and the environment. Interventions should also draw on past efforts to improve environmental management:																								Environmental management cannot be treated separately from other development concerns. To achieve significant, lasting results, it must be integrated with efforts to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. Improving environmental management in ways that benefit poor people requires policy and institutional changes that cut across sectors and lie mostly outside the control of environmental institutions...Successful environmental policies must see poor people not as part of the problem but as part of the solution. 																								Six policy principles should guide environmental policies: Strengthening institutions and governance, making environmental sustainability part of all sector policies, improving markets and removing environmentally damaging subsidies, bolstering international mechanisms for environmental management, investing in science and technology for the environment and increasing efforts to conserve critical ecosystems.

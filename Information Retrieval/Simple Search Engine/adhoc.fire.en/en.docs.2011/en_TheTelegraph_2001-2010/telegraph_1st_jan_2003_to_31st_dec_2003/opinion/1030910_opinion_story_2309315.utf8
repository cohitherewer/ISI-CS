		 Wednesday, September 10, 2003  DALIT POWER TO THE FORE
 - No political formation in UP has the foresight to craft  a broad alliance  MAHESH RANGARAJAN The author is an independent political  analyst and researcher The collapse of the fifteen-month-long  coalition government led by Mayavati may have been abrupt.  But there was little love lost between her Bahujan Samaj  Party and its post-poll ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party.  The chief minister may have chosen the time at which to  move on, but there was never a meeting of minds, let alone  a union of hearts of this rather odd couple.  The two parties first joined hands  in 1995, when the rift between the Dalit- led party and  the Yadav-dominated Samajwadi Party brought things to breaking  point. The shortlived minority government lasted barely  six months but it enabled Mayavati to virtually double her  share of the popular vote. The BSP has never looked back  since then. Once the rung to power for the upper castes  and then for the backward classes, the Dalits of Uttar Pradesh  had finally learnt to play one off against the other and  emerge with the trump card in hand. The next time they joined hands,  the scales were tilting in the BSPs favour but its leadership  failed to anticipate the rifts in its own ranks. Despite  its Dalit image, the party has always reached out to significant  groups of the Mandal castes, especially those that are lower  than the Yadavs in the social scale. Kalyan Singh split  the members of the legislative assembly on caste lines in  1997, and the Hindutva party took office without  actually having a popular mandate for administering the  countrys most populous state. Every time the BSP has been stung  in this manner it has actually bided its time and hit back.  In April 1999, its five members of parliament played a decisive  role in the Lok Sabha in enabling the ouster of the second  Vajpayee government.  Over the last few weeks a similar  drama was played out in Lucknow, only the stakes were even  higher for the chief minister. With the courts closing in  on the issue of the Taj corridor scandal, the inner circle  of bureaucrats and ministers close to the chief minister  was coming under ever-closer scrutiny. Even earlier, she  was put in her place by the central leadership of the BJP  when she tried to encroach on the prime ministers prerogative  of who ought to serve in the cabinet.  The downsizing of Mayavati saw  the state unit of the Hindutva party in a rare mood  of exultation. Even as the central leadership talked of  a seat sharing arrangement for the forthcoming Lok Sabha  polls, the two parties behaved less like partners and more  like rivals. This adversarial relationship was only made  worse by the fact that the BJP legislative was now smaller  in size than the BSP, 87 to the latters 110.  The state unit was already downcast.  It was bereft of able leaders after the expulsion of Kalyan  Singh and the humbling of Rajnath Singh in the 2002 state  assembly elections. A pre-poll accord with a powerful BSP  would have been the last straw. Yet this loomed larger than  ever in the gameplan of the national leadership as well  as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The BJPs backing of a Dalit woman  chief minister would put all lower caste critics of Hindutva  in a quandary. Mayavati, in turn, kept the heat on Mulayam  Singh Yadav, a possible fount of resistance to the BJP in  Uttar Pradesh. The deep rifts over land issues and the struggle  for power between the Dalits and the Mandal classes helped  the upper caste dominated Hindutva party. In turn Mayavati  would gain access to liberal largesse from the Centre and  entrench her party in power through use of patronage.  But the plans fell through on  more than one count. True, the two parties worked together  to defeat the Samajwadi Party in the byelection for the  assembly seat of Chiraigaon. But there remain serious doubts  about the open mindedness of the savarna Hindu voter  of the BJP mindset. Will he or she bow to Mayavatis leadership  and stamp on the elephant symbol come election time?  All the evidence suggests this  was never quite the case. The most rapid growth of support  for the saffron party in the state was in the late Eighties  and early Nineties. The upper caste voter turned from the  Congress to the mandir platform to keep lower caste  assertion at bay.  Already by 1989, the Bahujan Samaj  Party had polled nine per cent of the popular vote. This  went up marginally during the poll accord with Mulayam Singh  in 1993. From the mid-Nineties, it has more than doubled  and now stands at around 24 per cent. The latest break with  the BJP should suit the Dalit party. Over the years, it  has competed with the Samajwadi Party for the support of  the minorities and the lower backward communities. It will  now campaign that its leader was being made a scapegoat  in corruption cases, much the same way that Laloo Prasad  Yadav has done in neighbouring Bihar. Its electoral machine  is in order and ready to face the test of another election. The question really is whether  this latest break will bring about a major change in UP  politics. At present, this does not seem likely. Neither  the Samajwadi Party nor the BSP is about to fade from the  scene. The BJP, though a shadow of its former self, still  remains a far larger presence than the Congress.  This three-pronged struggle for  supremacy among the three large political formations has  polarized and divided the state. None is able to impose  its will or has the foresight to craft a lasting and broad  social alliance. Post-poll accords are also fraught with  tensions and contradictions.  A divided and polarized UP where  the Dalit and other backward classes-led formations are  the major players will also affect the options before national  parties. No wonder a section of the BJP was willing to gift  the state away to a Dalit-led party in return for the lions  share of seats in the Lok Sabha. And no wonder the Congress  is unsure about whether to ally with or oppose Mulayam Singh  Yadav. Either way, its options will narrow down. To win  more seats, it may have to resign itself to playing second  fiddle. On its own, it is not able to make it past the fourth  spot in the race. The real turn of the tide will  come if and when the BJPs vote bank in UP begins to fragment  and decline. It is in expectation of such a process that  the Samajwadi Party and the BSP have both dropped sharp  anti upper caste rhetoric. Each is busy wooing different  interest groups among the upper castes, promising them a  share of patronage in return for a subordinate place in  politics. The wheel has come full circle.

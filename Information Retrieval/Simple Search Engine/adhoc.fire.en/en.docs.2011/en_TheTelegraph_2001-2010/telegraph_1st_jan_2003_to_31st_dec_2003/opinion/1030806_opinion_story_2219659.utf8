		 Wednesday, August 06, 2003  THE POVERTY OF DATA
 - Junk in the name of official data for the Northeast  Bibek Debroy The author is Director, Rajiv Gandhi  Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi For this column, let me begin  with a table that I find very odd. This table shows poverty  or head count ratios, that is, the percentage of population  below the poverty line. And it is for the Northeast, with  Sikkim included in my definition of the Northeast. Calculation  of poverty ratios requires data and such data usually come  from expenditure surveys conducted by the National Sample  Survey. The NSS sometimes has thin or small samples. With  small samples, data are regarded as not terribly reliable.  Therefore, when poverty ratios are cited, they come from  large sample NSS data. The problem is that the NSS does  not have large samples every year. Typically, large samples  occur with a frequency of five years. We had large samples  in 1983-84, 1987-88, 1993-94 and 1999-2000. Using data from  large samples, the planning commission now calculates poverty  ratios for various states. These are separately calculated  for rural and urban areas and then spliced together to obtain  a combined figure. The first panel in the graphic  is now self-explanatory. This consists of poverty ratios  computed by the planning commission for the Northeast, for  the years 1983, 1993-94 and 1999-2000. I have reproduced  the combined poverty ratios, since the separate rural/urban  figures are irrelevant for purposes of the point I want  to make. And these figures are from the planning commissions  national human development report 2001, published in 2002.  Barring Mizoram, you notice very high levels of poverty  in the region. While all-India poverty ratios have dropped  by ten percentage points (from 36 per cent to 26 per cent)  from 1993-94 to 1999-2000, the drop in the Northeast (even  in Mizoram) has been less than proportionate. If these figures  are accurate, together with undivided Bihar, undivided Madhya  Pradesh, undivided Uttar Pradesh and Orissa, we need to  seriously worry about poverty levels in the Northeast.  The figures in the second panel  are what the planning commission expects poverty ratios  to be in the Northeast in 2006-07. These are projections  given in the tenth five year plan (2002-07) document. Notice  that not only are the poverty declines from 1993-94 to 1999-2000  not expected to be replicated between 1999-2000 and 2006-07  (except perhaps in Sikkim), poverty ratios are actually  expected to increase in Manipur and Mizoram. I find that  exceedingly odd. This is stranger still because the tenth  five year plan has statewise targets of gross state domestic  product growth. The annual average growth rate in Arunachal  Pradesh is expected to be 8 per cent, in Assam 6.2 per cent,  in Manipur 6.5 per cent, in Meghalaya 6.3 per cent, in Mizoram  5.3 per cent, in Nagaland 5.6 per cent, in Sikkim 7.9 per  cent and in Tripura 7.3 per cent. Lets ignore whether these  growth rates are reasonable or not and they are also separately  broken down into primary, secondary and tertiary sector  components. The tenth five year overall target of 8 per  cent annual gross domestic product is itself unreasonable.  But the GSDP growth and poverty ratios are both targets.  Are they mutually consistent, although the answer does depend  somewhat on the composition of growth? I think not. With  that kind of growth, how can you have such marginal declines  in poverty, and in two instances, even an increase? Doesnt  make sense and something is clearly wrong. Perhaps a clue can be found in  what the planning commission does with the poverty figures  for the Northeast. Let me quote from the national human  development report. Poverty Ratio of Assam is used for  Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur,  Nagaland and Tripura. Except for Assam, we dont even have  poverty ratios for the other northeastern states, because  the planning commission doesnt believe the NSS samples  are large enough for those regions. Assams poverty figures  are being superimposed on the other states. This is misleading,  to say the least. Why arent poverty figures for the other  states exactly the same as Assams figures then? I dont  know the exact methodology, but I believe something like  the following goes on. For exact details, you will have  to ask the planning commission. We have separate rural and  urban poverty figures for Assam and we have a breakup of  population in the other states according to the rural/urban  division. Assams rural poverty figures are then applied  to that particular states rural population and ditto for  the urban segment.  Because the rural/urban share  varies from state to state, you will therefore have a different  poverty ratio for the state from the Assam figure. No doubt  the details are somewhat more esoteric, because there is  a business of what population data to use (1991 or 2001  Census) and a question of matching the 77 NSS circles, but  that in essence, is what goes on. Hence, if you look at  the graphic again, you will find that with the exception  of Mizoram, all the other poverty ratios are clustered around  the Assam figure. We might as well junk the poverty figures  for the other northeastern states and look at the Assam  figure alone. So much for planning. Life becomes even more bizarre  when you consider what some independent researchers (outside  the planning commission) have done. Laveesh Bhandari and  Amaresh Dubeys work is a case in point. They have used  NSS data, but their own methodology, to work out poverty  figures for the northeast. This is the third panel, based  on NSS data for 1999-2000. The two sets of 1999-2000 figures  are remarkable in their deviations, for every state other  than Assam. Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland particularly  stand out. If these figures are correct, we are indeed talking  about significant poverty in Assam and poverty of slightly  different dimensions in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Sikkim  and Tripura. We dont need to worry about Meghalaya, Mizoram  and Nagaland. Accordingly, the tenth plans figures for  2006-07 will also go for a six. The problem probably is that our  mindsets havent changed. We tend to think of the Northeast  as a homogeneous entity and ascribe all of Assams characteristics  to that region. I dont know who is right, the planning  commission or Bhandari and Dubey. More accurately, I know  that what the planning commission does is wrong. But I dont  necessarily know that Bhandari and Dubey are right. What  is obvious is that we have junk in the name of official  data for the Northeast. Certainly for poverty and perhaps  in other instances as well. To be able to plan, you need  reliable data. Otherwise, it is garbage in and garbage out.

		 Wednesday, August 27, 2003  A CRISIS OF DIRECTION
 - The Congress needs to build on its strengths to win next  time  Mahesh Rangarajan The author is an independent political  analyst and researcher There is little doubt the Congress  remains a party sans direction despite the significant  groundwork in the post-Shimla phase. The drift, if it continues  unchecked, will not only spell electoral disaster. It may  raise questions about where the party stands in relation  to epochal changes in our polity and economy.  There are indeed indications of  change. In Uttar Pradesh, in particular, there are signs  of an emerging dialogue with the Samajwadi Party; even Maharashtra  shows Sharad Pawar and the Congress beginning to grasp that  they will either swim or sink together. One of the most  eminent left leaders in the country, Jyoti Basu, has publicly  declared there is no option for the left but to engage more  closely with the Congress. There can be, he admits, no serious  alternative to Hindutva unless the Congress is right  at its centre.  These positive straws in the wind  do not however add up to a party geared to take on the ruling  National Democratic Alliance. The recent arithmetic put  forward by the Bharatiya Janata Party general secretary,  Pramod Mahajan, explains why. The latter can put in the  field nearly 500 candidates who will either win or at least  finish in second place. The key to this extended presence  lies in the cooperation of a host of smaller allies, all  of whom are willing to cohabit with a party once regarded  as so extreme as to be desperate for allies. But to get here the BJP went through  two distinct phases. First, it expanded the appeal and reach  of its core agenda, first hitting the two-figure mark in  the Lok Sabha in 1989 and then the three-figure mark two  years later. Once it emerged as the premier opposition,  it first tried to polarize the polity and get closer to  a majority. Once this strategy took it to a plateau but  not beyond, it reached back into its anti-Congress past  to stitch together a wider alliance built around a minimalist,  rather than a maximalist, agenda. The contrast with the Congress  could not be starker. In 1989, L.K. Advani headed a group  of 110 members of parliament: today Sonia Gandhi has marginally  less than the same number. But the saffron party managed  to find a means to carve out a distinct niche in politics.  It did so even while entering into pre-poll alliances without  actually wielding power.  Part of the problem lies in the  legacy of the party. The Congress seems to lack the reflexes  of an opposition party. In 1999, it showed an unseemly hurry  to get to power and is still paying the price. Even earlier,  it gained no extra space in the political arena by pulling  down two successive United Front ministries. More recently,  whether it be the issue of Ayodhya or the defence scandals,  the party is unable to take the issue to the people at large.  It remains trapped in the legislature and media.  More than this, the Congress leadership  is unable to strike out a distinctive route for the country  to follow. In the past, many key turning points in the countrys  history emerged out of the inner councils of the Congress.  Indira Gandhis stray thoughts in Faridabad in 1969 were  the signal for a turn to the left. P.V. Narasimha Rao carried  through the economic reforms in 1991 in a more circumspect  manner, but his tenure marked a watershed by ushering in  market-friendly reforms.  Once out of office, the same organization  still has the instincts of a ruling party. It is internally  torn between the advocates of the older, statist model and  more pro-market adherents. But the nature and tone of the  debate is a dim echo of older clashes in its ranks. In the  Fifties, Charan Singh took on C.B. Gupta. In the more recent  past, Indira Gandhi drew on minds of the calibre of P.N.  Haksar and left wing intelligentsia to counter her critics.  Each player had a coherent philosophy and agenda. They were  not simply playing for the leaders ear.  In the present context, the debates  have a weary air about them. There is more posturing than  substance, as was evident in the one proposal to come from  Shimla, namely reservation in the private sector. Besides  being impossible to enforce, given the sheer number of small  businesses and self-employed people, it also has the threat  of further alienating the middle class. More than that,  it can hardly help the Congress if it tries to steal the  clothes of parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party. The last  time there was such an attempt to capture the agenda of  another organization was in the late Eighties. That was when Rajiv Gandhi bent  over backwards to woo the Hindu vote bank. In the process,  he only opened up the space for Advani. Rajivs touch legitimized  the Ayodhya movement at virtually every turn. A similar  scenario is in danger of being played out with regard to  caste-based mobilization. Similarly, it is notable how the  opposition space is being rapidly taken over by other players,  even constitutional authorities. The former president, K.R.  Narayanan, emerged as the most articulate critic of the  constitutional reforms favoured by sections of the sangh  parivar. Without stepping beyond the ambit of his powers,  he raised enough questions to make the government rethink  its approach.  Of late, the chief election commissioner,  J.M. Lyngdoh, was the first to strongly resist the bid to  push for simultaneous elections to the state assemblies  and the house of the people. The chief opposition party  was much more cautious in coming out against a measure that  would go against the federal spirit of the Constitution. There is still hope for the Congress.  The ruling alliance is more anxious than it lets on about  how political events will unfold in the coming months. Nothing  else explains why there is persistent talk of moving the  Lok Sabha polls forward. A rout at the hands of Congress  this winter in the four assembly elections in north India  cannot be ruled out.  The chief reason: the BJP has  weaker players at the helm in the key states compared to  more seasoned hands that head the Congress governments.  None of the Congress leaders, least of all Digvijay Singh,  is a push over. They have all the attributes the high command  has shown itself to be lacking in ever so often, above all,  an ability to outwit their opponents and to set the agenda  in the public sphere. Politics in a democracy is about  the people. There is no better illustration of this than  the track record of todays ruling party. In 1984, the BJP  hit rock bottom, as it was unable to connect to the wider  electorate. In the next elections, it drove home the distance  of the rulers from the masses through one word: Bofors.  It is here that todays opposition is not defining itself  sharply enough. In the next two polls, the Hindutva  party played to its home constituency in the name of Ram.  Here again, the Congress needs to reach out to its own core  constituency of the under classes and women. No doubt there is room for ambiguity  in a democracy. No party can spell out a programme in full  detail given the constraints it will have to govern under,  if it should win. Yet, there has to be a clearer shape to  a programme and a vision than the Congress has thus far  been able to spell out.  It is not enough to say its leader  ought to be prime minister. It is more important to spell  out what it hopes to achieve to cure the myriad ills of  our polity, society and economy.  Should the Congress president  fail next time round, it will come up with claimants to  leadership of the party from within its second rung leaders.  The party can tolerate failure, but its patience is not  endless.

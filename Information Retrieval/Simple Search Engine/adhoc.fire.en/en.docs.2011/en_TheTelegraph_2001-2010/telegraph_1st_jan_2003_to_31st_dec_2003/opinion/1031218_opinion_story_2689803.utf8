		 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 LOOSEN THEIR IRON GRIP
 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee realizes the need to rein in teachers unions, but convincing his party colleagues will not be an easy task, writes Ashis Chakrabarti				 	 Test case 																								I am not surprised that leaders of college and university teachers associations are upset with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees plan to grant autonomy to some colleges in West Bengal. Even some partners of the ruling Left Front, particularly the Revolutionary Socialist Party, have cribbed that granting autonomy to some institutions is the first step towards the privatization of higher education. But objections by the teachers associations are a different matter altogether. For far too long, these associations have enjoyed a kind of extra-constitutional authority and power in educational administration which they fear to lose if the chief minister has his way.																								I had my first experience of this malevolent power of the leaders of unionized teachers way back in 1977. An eminent professor of English at Presidency College applied for the post of reader in the English department of Calcutta University. He wanted to leave his dear old college, not out of love for the university department, but because he was anxious that the policies of the new left government would see him transferred to a nondescript government college in the districts. 																								Such was his fame as a scholarly teacher that any university would have been proud to have him on its faculty. The selection committee too recommended his appointment. But some leaders of the universitys teachers association had other ideas. Favouring an internal candidate, they mounted a bitter campaign against the selection committees recommendation. Worse still, they sought to intimidate the professor so that he would not join his new job at the university to avoid possible trouble. He eventually did join the university, thanks to the anxiety of the then vice-chancellor, Sushil Kumar Mukherjee, and most of his future departmental colleagues to have him. 																								There were two basic lessons from the episode. First, the teachers association sought to interfere in an academic appointment in a completely extra-constitutional manner. Second, the association was more interested in promoting a members case at the cost of both fairness and quality. 																								It was still early days for the Left Front government and the plans of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to take control of education were still unfolding. As the Left Front consolidated its supremacy in the states politics, winning election after election, its grip on education tightened accordingly. And, just as the episode ominously indicated, teachers associations owing allegiance to the Marxists became more anxious to fill colleges and universities with sympathizers than to maintain the academic and administrative independence of institutions. In the process, they sacrificed excellence and quality at the altar of partisan interests. All this in the name of the democratization of higher education.																								Obviously, bodies like the West Bengal College and University Teachers Association could wield such powers because of their links with the CPI(M). The Left Fronts education cell became the arbiter of academic matters in the state. For the Marxists, controlling school and higher education was only superficially an ideological issue  democracy versus elitism, and so on. Actually, it had more to do with winning over an important social group and through it a crucial political constituency. 																								Ask any independent-minded college or university teacher and you would know how stifling the WBCUTAs grip has been. College principals who fall foul of the associations local leaders have a difficult time. Governing bodies of colleges function at the mercy of these leaders or their nominees. Even the minimum administrative norms are difficult to maintain without the help of these leaders. If not in the same degree, other teachers outfits can be as intimidating.																								Worse still, some association leaders have become a law unto themselves. Teachers who dare disagree with these leaders or their factional acolytes receive raw deals and are sometimes abused. Many such teachers have had rather unpleasant experiences of encounters with the leaders at the WBCUTAs office on Mahatma Gandhi Road. 																								It is impossible to miss the parallel between the ways of these leaders and those of the militant leaders of the CPI(M)s other influential wing, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions. If you ignore the veneer of middle-class respectability, there could be little to choose between some leaders of teachers associations and the old-style, heavy-handed CITU leaders. Just as the labour leaders militancy and illegitimate interference with the management had spelt the doom for many an industrial unit in West Bengal, much of the states educational malaise can be attributed to the union culture of the teachers associations.																								But the Left Fronts new industrial policy and the chief ministers anxiety to woo investors into the state have forced the CPI(M) to discipline the CITU and generally introduce a new work culture among government employees. The winds of reform are blowing through other sectors like agriculture too. 																								Even in education, old ideas are being shed and a new emphasis put on excellence, quality and autonomy. Bhattacharjee cites the examples of private engineering colleges, the National University of Juridical Sciences and the institute of information technology as the first clutch of reforms in education. The watchwords for these reforms are private enterprise, autonomy and excellence. 																								He now wants to extend these principles to college education and has identified five undergraduate colleges as the first step. Granting autonomy to Presidency College is his most crucial test for several reasons. First, it is a government college and making it autonomous will be a major signal of the states withdrawal from higher education, even if the government continues to fund it and to indirectly involve itself with its administration. More important, it will symbolize a retreat from the old leftist position of anti-elitism and a new focus on academic excellence.																								But a clean-up of education would require him and his party to do much the same things that they had to do with the CITU to regain investors faith. One of these is to curb the influence of teachers associations to ensure proper academic freedom. No institution can be truly autonomous if unionized teachers hold it to ransom. No one would suggest that teachers should cease to have their associations that are free to go about their legitimate business, but they must allow the administration to run independently.																								The question is whether the CPI(M) is willing to curb the powers of teachers associations the way it has put the CITU in its place. The answer, to my mind, is that the partys old mindset is still holding sway over education. The party, it seems, is still unwilling to loosen its grip on education and let the flowers bloom. 																								A long conversation with the chief minister recently gave me the impression that he still had to win over some party colleagues on the question of freeing education from the old controls. But he seemed to share the feeling that the time had come to shake off the burden of organizations like WBCUTA on educational administration.

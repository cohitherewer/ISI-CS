		 Friday, August 01, 2003  Paperback Pickings Silkworms in a violent world Trespassing (Penguin,  Rs 395) by Uzma Aslam Khan is a rather self-consciously  complicated book about silkworms, Pakistani society and  America, with patches of self-consciously exquisite prose,  described by Tariq Ali as silken: Everywhere she looked,  each caterpillar nosed the air like a wand and out passed  silk. They sashayed to the left and swivelled to the right.  They bobbed and undulated, dotting the air in figure-eights.  They worked ceaselessly for three days and nights, with  material entirely of their own, and with nothing to orchestrate  them besides their own internal clock. Each, a perfectly  self-contained unit of life. Fifty key figures in management  (Routledge, Rs 395) by Morgen Witzel is  a text-book about mighty management men (there isnt a single  woman). The chronological sweep of this inventory of influential  people begins with Lao Tzu (6th century BC), goes on to  Machiavelli (15th-16th century) and finishes with Bill Gates  (1955-). Management, Witzel declares, is the most important  phenomena of modern civilization. Mapping mars: science, imagination  and the birth of a world (Fourth Estate,  8.99)  by Oliver Morton is a readable, absorbing and  eccentrically researched on the human imaging and imagining  of Mars. Its the embodiment of a process, a process that  forges links between far-off Mars and the cartographers  drawing board point by point, feature by feature. It embodies  links of reason and technology that runs though the cameras  of now-dead spacecraft millions of kilometres away, and  through the minds of the men who designed and controlled  those cameras. Collected Stories, Vol. 1  (Penguin, Rs 250) by Shashi Deshpande is an  interesting gathering of stories by an Indian novelist and  short-story writer, originally published in literary journals,  magazines and newspapers. These stories are mostly about  men and women trapped in relationships and situations not  of their making. The best of Laxman: the common  man seeks justice (Penguin, Rs 200) is another  in the endless series of cartoons unfailingly churned out  by R.K. Laxman in The Times of India. From financial  crises to the woes of householders, from political instability  to rampant corruption, Laxmans cartoons capture the entire  gamut of contemporary Indian experience.

		 Monday, January 06, 2003 				 BACK TO THE FUTURE OF THE EURO
 GWYNNE DYER																								I want the whole of Europe to have one currency, said Napoleon in 1807. A year ago his dream came true, and it didnt even take a conquest to make it happen. But where does the euro go from here? 																								The simple answer is out and up. It spreads outwards from the existing 12 countries that abandoned their old marks, francs and drachmas for the euro last year to one or more of the three hold-outs among the existing European Union members, Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and then on to the 12 new countries scheduled to join within the next five years. And it goes back up in value from the rock-bottom $ 0.90 it hit last year towards the $ 1.17 it was worth when it was launched. (Its currently at $ 1.04.)																								The euro is not yet much loved by those who use it. There is a widespread perception that retailers used the changeover in currencies as an excuse to hike their prices  and of course they did. The overall inflation rate in the euro countries doesnt show a big jump, so the economists deny that it happened, but in a number of everyday consumer items from newspapers to beer, there was a cynical rounding up of prices that raised their cost between 3 and 8 per cent.																								The real question																								The experts still promise that in the long run the new transparency of prices across the euro-zone means that they will eventually converge towards the cheaper end of the spectrum. This may or may not be true, but theres no going back to the old currencies anyway. 																								The real question is how long it will take the euro-zone countries to give up enough of their sovereign independence to ensure the euros long-term survival. 																								The problem with any currency union is that you have to impose one-size-fits-all monetary policies on quite diverse economies. For example, Germanys high unemployment and low growth call for low interest rates and deficit spending at the moment. Ireland, with low unemployment and high inflation, needs exactly the opposite. But the new European Central Bank must set the same interest rate for Ireland, Germany and all the other euro-zone countries.																								So the problems of economic divergence fester even in good times, and threaten the survival of the currency in bad times. Currency unions that are not backed by a single, strong central authority tend to founder when the going gets rough, and it sometimes does. There were at least six events in 20th-century history  the World Wars, the Great Depression, the Russian and Nazi revolutions, and the 1973 oil embargo  that the euro in its present form would be unlikely to survive. 																								Prepare for a shock																								There is probably enough time for the EU to get things right before the next shock, and the architects of the euro privately understand that there has to be far more integrated decision-making at the political level if the euro is to survive the storms that are bound to arrive sooner or later. They just havent mentioned it much in public yet: first you lure the punters into the deal with promises that it will be easy and painless, and once they have signed up, you tell them the real price.																								The real price is probably worth paying, because the ultimate purpose of the euro is not economic at all; it is to embed all of Europe in an economic relationship that makes any return to the catastrophic continent-wide wars of the past unthinkable. But pretty soon, people in the know will have to reveal the next step of the journey to everybody else.																								In fact, its starting to happen already. In 2001, Belgiums finance minister, Didier Reynders, who was doubling as the chairman of the 12-nation euro group, let a little of the real thinking slip out: At a certain moment, perhaps in two years, well have to put the question. Those who said yes to the euro will move ahead.. You cant indefinitely delay the question of political authority (for the euro-zone), and its logical that well make a choice to pool our forces.																								Down that road, if it is travelled to the end, lies the United States of Europe.

		 Wednesday, November 26, 2003  ON THE TRAIL OF A CITY
 The changing preferences of urban  India may be reflect- ed in Delhis choice of a forward-looking  Congress over an obscurantist BJP, argues Mahesh Rangarajan The author is an independent political  analyst and researcher Reaching out  Few observers or analysts of the  poll scene give the Bharatiya Janata Party a serious chance  of making a return to power in Delhi. The Union territory,  with its 14 million citizens and the truncated powers of  its assembly, may seem less significant than the larger  states going to the polls. Yet, given its very distinctive  place in the history of the ruling party, a second successive  defeat would not only mean a break with history, but it  may also give a glimmer, if only a glimmer, of new possibilities  for governance in urban India. Delhis importance for the Jana  Sangh was a product both of its geographical location (at  the edge of the Punjab from where refugees poured in after  Partition), and of its being one of the first major bases  of power for the party, which quickly emerged as a major  challenger to the ruling Congress. The first Bharatiya Jana  Sangh regime in the metropolitan council was presided over  by the present party spokesman, V.K. Malhotra, and the chairman  was none other than L.K. Advani. Interestingly, one was  a Punjabi and the other a Sindhi. The small but very well  organized refugee population soon took hold of the citys  political machine. The Congress was not far behind in the  race but over time, it was the Jana Sangh and later the  BJP that emerged as the favoured choice. A variety of factors facilitated  this process and a quick look at them is essential. Delhi  did not witness a major working class or militant Dalit  movement. The major occupation of a large section was self-employment  or trade: the growth of government services added to the  body of white-collar workers. Even a decade ago, Delhi was  exceptional among the four metros in having a slight majority  of savarnas, or upper castes. Partition reduced the  population of Muslims sharply, though they now make up just  fewer than 10 per cent.  The Congress, in turn, made Delhi  one of the early sites of its soft Hindutva politics  in the early Eighties. Since 1967, no party has won two  elections in the city in a row. In 1983, the ruling Congress  wooed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and reaped a rich  harvest. It paid for a while but the ghost came back to  haunt the party. Its role in patronizing lumpen elements  began in the Sanjay Gandhi period, which lasted for a decade  from the early Seventies. But the 1984 massacres of Sikhs  marked a new low, a repeat of the kind of insensate violence  that reshaped the city so fundamentally at the time of Partition. The Congress had to wait its turn  till as late as 1998 to win another local election. Even  Rajiv Gandhi hesitated to try out the partys strength in  the city, holding off polls and preferring direct rule by  the lieutenant governor. What helped the return of the Congress  was more than the misrule of three successive BJP chief  ministers in the span of just five years. But in the Nineties, the latter  had also metamorphosed and grown. The rural hinterland came  into play after decades, with a Jat chief minister in the  form of Sahib Singh Verma. The old guard led by Madan Lal  Khurana, whose career can be traced back to the Sixties,  fought back, letting the Congress in through the back door.  What did more damage was the partys decision to pick a  Haryana politician, Sushma Swaraj, to lead it. Its own base  had expanded to bring in new sections: Jats, Dalits and  white collar professionals. But the party machine was still  dominated by the Sixties brand of ideologues. They fell  behind the times. It does not seem to have made  up lost ground since then. Earlier this year, elections  to the Delhi University Students Union, which has over  150,000 members, saw the BJP lose by a hefty margin. A pre-poll  survey by the Centre for Study of Developing Societies and  a leading daily came up with shocking statistics. More than  one out of two voters under the age of 25 preferred to vote  for the Congress. For a party that has been in power for  five years, this must indeed be heartening news. Not only  that, the BJP seems to be running neck and neck with the  Congress even among the trader and refugee communities that  have historically formed its backbone. More ominously, the BJP has yet  to realize how much the social make-up and character of  the city have changed in the last couple of decades. Today,  possibly as many as four out of ten of Delhis citizens  were born in a village or small town in Uttar Pradesh or  Bihar. They lack the sort of organic link that bound the  refugee or the trader to the sangh: they do not attend  shakhas, study in Arya Samaj schools or have an account  with the Punjab National Bank. True, there has been an expansion  of sangh affiliates in the voluntary school systems. But  that is not enough. Logically speaking, Delhi could  have become fertile ground for the third front kind of politics.  The Janata Dal did grow in the early Nineties but its main  impact was to eat into the Congress vote bank. It has since  more or less vanished from the scene, though there are signs  of the slow growth of the Bahujan Samaj Party in some pockets.  The key to the Congresss success  lies perhaps in being in step with the times. It has pushed  through with power privatization, which is still in its  early days but has on the whole met with a positive public  reception. The new water treatment plant to be commissioned  in December will actually wipe out the deficit in water  supply for some time. The change-over to compressed natural  gas for commercial vehicles was required by a court order  but the Sheila Dikshit government cooperated and made it  work. The general impression is of a government that looks  forward to tackling problems in an efficient and business-like  manner. The growth of a larger, more cosmopolitan  middle-class constituency for environment-related issues  has also seen the Congress beat the BJP. The relocation  of 40,000 industrial units is still going through serious  teething problems but it has more vocal support now than  similar such attempts have had in the past.  There is much that an effective  opposition could have focussed on. A report on the State  of Governance, a citizens handbook by the Centre for Civil  Society, highlights several issues. For instance, municipal  schools are under-staffed but over Rs 500 million was returned  unspent last year. Similarly, surveys show a lack of basic  amenities for as many as three million people. Little headway  has been made on these fronts. The point still is that the Congress  at least looks like it is listening, if only with one ear.  Perhaps, another election rout will lead to a glasnost in  the BJP. Interestingly, the party presides over a coalition  at the Centre and has swept the city in every general election  since 1984. But the disintegration of its base in the capital  is a salutary lesson. A party that does not evolve and grow  with the times will be left behind, certainly not a good  prospect for a party that once was the natural choice  for much of urban north India. But a symbol that protests  against sales tax, resists any attempts at environmental  improvement and berates the government no longer sells.  Urban India will soon include a third of all Indians. Perhaps  Delhi is a portent that the politics they will prefer is  of a new and different sort.

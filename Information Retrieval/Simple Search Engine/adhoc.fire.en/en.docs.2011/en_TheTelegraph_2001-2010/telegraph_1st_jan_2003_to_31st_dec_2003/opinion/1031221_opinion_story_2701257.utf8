The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, December 21, 2003 				 SMALL PIECE OF HISTORY
																								If history can be made in the historic town of Ayodhya, it can also be made in an alley in Calcutta. In the very heart of Kidderpore lies Metiabruz, an area that developed when the last Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah, came to live there in exile from his beloved Lucknow. Apart from this, Metiabruz has no other claim to fame. But recently, the actions of some Muslims in the area might pitchfork it into news and history. A group of Muslims has petitioned the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, to save a temple from being pulled down by realtors. These Muslims believe that demolition of the temple would disturb prevailing Hindu-Muslim relations in the neighbourhood. The temple is not an old one; it also does not have any history or tradition attached to it. Yet a group of Muslims feels that it is a structure that should be preserved. There is nothing heroic in this enterprise. Ordinary people have gone about doing what they considered to be their duty. But in acting thus, they have shown the awareness and responsibility expected from the citizens of a secular democracy. They have demonstrated that civic life, if it has to survive and grow, must move beyond the state of nature where narrow self-interest and force hold sway.																								In these turbulent times, when religious sectarianism is on the rise everywhere and relations between Hindus and Muslims appear to be particularly fragile, the actions of a Muslim to save a temple are remarkable for their significance. Sometime ago, The Telegraph and its sister newspaper for schoolchildren, TTIS, reported the life story of a poor Muslim man in Midnapore who had devoted his life to conserve and refurbish a cluster of terracotta temples near his village. On the heels of the carnage in Gujarat had come, almost in ironic counterpoint, the report of Sikhs in Gurdaspur district in Punjab handing over a mosque to Muslims. This mosque  Guru ke Maseet  was built by the sixth Sikh guru, Hargovind, in the 17th century. From 1984, the mosque had served as a gurdwara but this did not stop the Sikhs from making over the mosque to their Muslim brethren. Incidents such as these, often unnoticed and unreported, stand in sharp contrast to what happened in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992. These stray incidents strengthen the impression that communal tension is created and aggravated by interested parties. The incidents also belie the theory assiduously peddled by some people that Hindus and Muslims have always lived in a spirit of mutual animosity.																								It has been nobodys argument that Hindus and Muslims have always lived in idyllic harmony. There have been disputes and controversies but these have been local. Mass based political parties, for reasons of their own, have sought to capitalize on such disputes by projecting them onto the national level. The Metiabruz episode shows a reverse trend. A local real estate issue, which is potentially explosive in a sensitive area, is being taken to the level of the state administration. The aim is to preserve peace and friendship, and religion has not diverted sensible and responsible people from the bigger social objective. The small and the obscure, like the ones celebrated in Grays Elegy, have set an example.

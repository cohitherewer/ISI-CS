		 Monday, August 04, 2003  COPING WITH CALAMITY
 - Even partial preparedness helps in the case of predictable  disasters  BHASKAR GHOSE The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting A terrible flood has hit Assam;  hundreds are without food, water and shelter, and thousands  of acres of agricultural land have been submerged, destroying  crops worth crores. Most of this belonged to farmers whose  income was, at best, meagre  now they face the prospect  of being pauperized. The situation is no better in the northern  parts of West Bengal, and of Bihar  there, too, the poorest  in the rural areas have lost their homes, and the hope of  some income from their crops. Relief of some kind is being  provided, to be sure; but it is never enough, barely sufficient  to give the victims enough to eat every day.  Not very long ago, before the  monsoon came, Andhra Pradesh suffered a dreadful heat wave,  in which over a thousand people died. Fields were burned  dry by the heat, water sources and wells dried up. Then,  too, the calamity was not confined to Andhra Pradesh alone;  parts of Orissa suffered equally. Again, whatever relief  was provided was not considered adequate; and, of course,  there was little anyone could do to prevent people from  going out in the blazing sun  they had to earn a living,  as labourers or hawkers, and it was mostly such people who  died. Going further back a few months,  in the cold wave in December, January and February there  were several people who died of the cold, who did not have  enough clothing to provide them with any kind of warmth,  and had little or no access to sheltered places where the  intensity of the cold would not have been lethal. Once again,  some kind of relief was provided, there were night shelters,  and the distribution of blankets and warm clothing, but  not enough to prevent people from dying. These are not calamities that  occur very rarely and take everyone by surprise. Floods,  heat waves and intensely cold conditions occur every year,  and every year people die, or lose their livelihood or their  land. True, such calamities can never ever be stopped, nor  can complete protection be provided against the sufferings  they bring. Add to this the generally fragile condition  of people, particularly women and children in villages or  in the slums of our cities, and one can see that fatalities  can never be prevented completely. But need they be as high as they  are now? It is necessary for those who are charged with  the welfare of the people  in the state and Central governments   to ask themselves whether they are doing enough to lessen  the suffering and the number of deaths. This is not an easy  task, as everyone will readily admit. Floods, particularly,  cause havoc on such a scale that it costs the public exchequer  a huge amount just to get communications  road, rail and  telephone  back, to repair buildings, clear canals and  drains.  But that said, there still remains  the question of whether enough is being done to lessen the  sufferings of the victims of natural calamities. Providential  calamities, Kautilya says, are of eight kinds: fire, floods,  pestilential diseases, famine, rats, serpents and demons.  From these, the king shall protect his kingdom. If, for  the moment, we leave aside the last three, the other five  remain even today as real calamities which have to be tackled. Having accepted that what one  can do is never going to be enough, one must not, consequently,  go to the other extreme, and say that we cant do anything  except provide only token relief. There is a great deal  that can be done and it needs to be considered with high  seriousness, and given the importance and urgency one would  to crises like widespread violence or even war. It is being  done elsewhere; theres no reason why we cant do so here. Effective, and modern early warning  systems would provide some very precious time to move people  from danger areas and save lives, whether from floods or  other calamities. If it is impossible to predict some calamities  like earthquakes with any certainty, then other steps, like  making sure that only structures that can withstand earthquakes  of an intensity that is the most common in the region are  built, should be taken  be they public buildings or residential  houses. Some system of making subsidies available could  surely be worked out; after all, in the event of an earthquake  crores would have to be spent on rebuilding houses and other  buildings, and in that context this kind of subsidy would  be a worthwhile investment. Where early warning systems can  and do work well is when floods occur. Authorities can be  alerted well in advance about unusually high rainfall in  catchment areas, in the upper reaches of rivers and other  sensitive locations; that would make it possible to move  people away in time to safer places, where adequate food,  water and shelter would be available. But it isnt really a question  of early warning systems in terms of equipment which provides  warnings so much as foreseeing calamities in the long term.  This is what is really needed and this is what is virtually  non-existent. We know what the calamities are in this country,  and we have a fairly accurate idea of how violent and widespread  they can be. So, can there not be some kind of measures  taken to be prepared at least to the extent possible? Its  not for me to say what the nature of preparedness should  be; itll obviously be different for different eventualities,  but the fact is these can be worked out and equipment kept  in areas which are calamity-prone, and personnel trained  to cope with it.  More important, the local authorities  need to be given access to funds and financial authority  which makes it possible for them to get things done without  frantic calls being made every time to the state government.  Somebody in authority in the states  and in the Centre must sit down and determine what priority  these calamities need to be given. Its easy to be very  clever and detached about them because position insulates  them from the suffering calamities bring. But officers who  have had to deal with them would know what is involved,  and only they can determine what kind of foresight is required  at the level of the district, state and the Centre.  These are the kind of people,  and those representatives of the people who have actually  seen or even suffered from these calamities, who need to  be brought together and asked to work out what needs to  be done. What the political executive in states and the  Centre need to do is give the deliberations of these people  the importance they merit, and act on the advice they give.  When there isnt a calamity the accounts people will no  doubt make constipated remarks on funds being unutilized  (lovely word, that, coined, no doubt, by a gnome in some  accounts section  the sort whod see celibacy as an irregular  act where a certain organ was unutilized) but, if the thinking  has been realistic, and the equipment and funds provided  as adequate as possible, then when a calamity does occur  they may make the difference between a large number of people  dying or living, between the spending of astronomical sums  in rebuilding and restoring damage and amounts that would  be relatively more modest. From these the king shall protect  his kingdom. Will this ever happen? Who knows   the state and Central governments usually live from day  to day and it would be a wise and true statesman who would  be able to see ahead and recognize the value of being at  least partially prepared. There may be some such somewhere,  and they may decide to think ahead, looking beyond the immediate  calamities to those that are bound to visit us in future  years. One can only live in hope and expectation, and leave  reality to unravel in time.

		 Tuesday, June 24, 2003  CONTEMPORANEITY OF TRADITIONS
 Tradition has to be questioned in  order to prove its greatness and establish its link with modernity,  argues Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting		 From Girish Karnad's HayavadanaThis is not a piece about tradition  and modernity alone. Tradition is, to my mind, something  dynamic, handed down through the ages, and modernity is,  to me, the ability of this tradition to respond to what  Shakespeare called the form and pressure of the times. What  is contemporary is merely of the present, the primary quality  of which is that it is here, now, and the traditional is  the sort of stuff that has been handed reverently down the  ages as something not to be questioned, not to be altered  by even a jot, a sacred heritage, even though it may be  mildewed, its edges frayed and worn. I am referring primarily to the  performing arts, and what set me off on this was having  to sit through a performance of a play in what was obviously  considered a contemporary style. The players stroked, pushed  and threw each other about while the dialogue was completely  at variance with what they were doing, very inward, very  personal. As I came out of the theatre, I tried to make  some sense of all this. One saw the compulsions  to be  different, to clothe the text of the play with ones own  creative impulses, such as they are. But thats a very very  dangerous thing, because if ones creative impulses are  mediocre what you end up with is something grotesque, an  imposition on an increasingly resentful audience, all of  which adds up to the general conviction that theatre is,  indeed, something weird, something one can do without.  This does not mean, nor am I saying  Look to the traditional, follow what we have been given  by our glorious past. Too often that means a mindless and  mechanical presentation where the artistes  particularly  in dance  meticulously follow all the old forms, and add  nothing to it. That, again, results in the audience leaving  with the conviction that they could have spent their time  in a more worthwhile manner than by watching a tedious sterile  performance, where the artiste is little more than a marionette.  Inevitably, this too results in a growing conviction that  all this traditional stuff is dull, boring and best avoided. There is however, I am convinced,  a different place in all this, a place where the traditional  is not merely that but much more a dynamic tradition, informed  by the artistes imagination, and that imagination is itself  inspired by what he or she has discovered in the rigour  of the tradition that has been enriched over centuries by  the perceptions of many creative minds. As in dance, so  in theatre, so in music. Tradition evolves, and develops  and grows; it takes into itself attributes that come from  the genius of artistes, playwrights and musicians who have  immersed themselves in the traditional and fashioned from  it something uniquely modern. A great musician like the late  Kumar Gandharva sang classical Hindustani music, but he  brought to it his own creative genius, and has left behind  unique, magical music which is at once steeped in tradition  and is also modern in the finest sense of the term. So it  is with others, in other forms; Girish Karnad uses traditional  forms in his plays, but they are informed by his genius,  his creative imagination, which makes them so very modern,  in that we respond to it because it communicates with us  through the myth and the form which Karnad fashions in his  own, brilliant way.  But for every Kumar Gandharva  and Girish Karnad there are many more who consider being  modern means just being new and sensational, and what  one then sees or hears is grotesque and embarrassingly bad.  Peter Brook in his book, There Are No Secrets, mentions  precisely this, but in a context that pinpoints the essence  of the issue. In many Third World countries, theatre groups  tackle plays by European authors, such as Brecht or Sartre.  Often they fail to recognize that these authors worked through  a complex system of communication that belonged to their  own time and place. In a completely different context, the  resonance is no longer there. Imitations of the avant-garde  experimental theatre of the Sixties encounter the same difficulty.  So sincere theatre workers in Third World countries, in  a state of pride and despair, dig into their past and attempt  to modernize their myths, rituals and folklore, but unfortunately,  this often results in a poor mixture that is neither fish  nor fowl. Brook goes on to point out that  Shakespeare had perhaps the largest vocabulary of any English  poet, over 25,000 words, combining obscure philosophical  terms with the crudest of obscenities. Modernity would lie,  in Brooks terms, in an imaginatively inspired artiste adding  to these 25,000 words the other attributes that go to make  up theatre  body language, sound language, rhythm language,  scenery language, lighting language. Images from the past,  images from tradition, images from today these are like  nouns and adjectives with which we can make new phrases.  That, then is the challenge. Can we use them well? Will  that usage make what we express more poignant, more true?  Its not only a question of taking  a form of dance, lets say, and then having the dancers  use some of its movements and then roll over each other  and leap up and down, combining acrobatics and circus virtuosity  with a form of dance that on its own has a power and vigour  that needs only those attributes which make it more meaningful,  provide more insight, more truth. This form of contemporary  claptrap does immense harm to the original form in two ways;  first, it leaves a large number of those who watch the leaping  and rolling about with a strange notion of the form, and  second, it provides, at best, a fleeting interest of the  kind one would have in a six-legged donkey. The cumulative  result is a general alienation from the form, from dance  itself, in some cases, and the pushing of this performing  art into a marginal place in the social consciousness.  Somewhere there must be a way  in which a new consciousness can not just grow, but become  more general than it is now. The obsession is with style,  new style, unusual style; anything that avoids what is perceived  to be a clich, and worn out. But style, as Evelyn Waugh  said, is not just avoiding the clich. Its avoiding the  place where you can feel the clich is being avoided. And  here one has to look at what is traditional, and instead  of deifying it, ask what it is in todays terms. What in  the present body of the times, to repeat Shakespeares phrase,  is its form and pressure? True tradition is responsive,  and must absorb the best of what is brought to it from within  its own terms or even from outside it.  David Hare, the playwright, recounts  a conversation he had with the celebrated film critic, Barry  Norman, who was praising a film hed seen as a great work.  Hare asked him what it was saying. Norman looked at him  as if he were mad and said it didnt matter; the greater  the film the more irrelevant such a question was. Whats  Casablanca about? he asked, Whats Citizen Kane  about? Hare told him, simply, that if Norman had the time,  he, David Hare, would tell him what these films were about,  at length. Norman clearly did not wish to know, and left.  It is this which destroys what  one reveres as great, in the end. This unquestioning acceptance  of something as great. Its necessary to ask, as David Hare  did, Whats it saying? In the answer will lie the greatness  of tradition, and its link with modernity.

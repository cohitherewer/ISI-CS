 RAJA DEEN DAYAL: PRINCE OF PHOTO-  GRAPHERS (Creative Point, price not mentioned)  by Narendra Luther is a lavish exploration of the life and  work of an extraordinary Indian artist. Deen Dayal was born  in 1844 in an affluent Jain family in Uttar Pradesh and  went on to receive the royal warrant of appointment as photographer  to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII. His luxurious studio  in Bombay was frequented not only by the British but also  by the Indian princes. Come when you have no other engagement  immediately following, so as not to feel flurried, he advised  his sitters. One of the nizams of Hyderabad used  to claim that Deen Dayals photograph of him could convey  the scent of his ittar. He was a versatile photographer,  as interested in human subjects as architectural or archaeological  ones. The only copy of his Views of India is in Windsor  Castle in England. This is a photograph of ladies listening  to an educational lecture.

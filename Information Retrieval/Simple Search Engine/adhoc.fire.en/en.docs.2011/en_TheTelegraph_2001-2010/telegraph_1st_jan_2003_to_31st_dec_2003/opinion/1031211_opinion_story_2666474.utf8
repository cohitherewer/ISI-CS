		 Thursday, December 11, 2003 				 AT THE RISK OF LOSING CREDIBILITY
 															- Document  From the Asian Centre for Human Rights  alternate report to Indias first periodic report for the  UN committee on the rights of the child				 	 Lost worlds																								When the Chakmas and Hajongs who were born after their migration and are citizens under Section 3(1)(a) of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, went to the assistant electoral registration officer of Diyun under Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh, the said officer refused to accept their Form 6  application for inclusion of name in electoral rolls. The Committee for Citizenship Rights of the Chakmas of Arunachal Pradesh subsequently approached the ministry of home affairs of the government of India. The MHA informed that the Election Commission had been requested to include all the Indian citizens into the electoral rolls.																								But the Election Commission took no action. Since no action had been taken to ensure that the Chakma and Hajong voters were enrolled in the voters list, the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties and the CCRCAP filed a writ petition...before the Delhi high court. In its judgment on September 28, 2000, the Delhi high court ordered enrolment of all eligible Chakma and Hajong voters into the electoral rolls.																								This order, too, was flouted. The Chakma and Hajong applicants were not enrolled on frivolous grounds such as the polling station in which name is to be included is not mentioned, house number of the applicant is not provided and that there is no proof of citizenship when the applicants are citizens by birth. This despite that establishing a polling station or providing house numbers are the tasks of the government...																								In December 2002, the applications for inclusion into the electoral rolls in 2002 were rejected on similar frivolous grounds.																								The CCRCAP informed the Election Commission of India about the systematic obstacles being created by the state election commission and the state government officials in clear violation of the Delhi high court judgment. The Election Commission of India, which has gained its reputation of being one of the most credible institutions in India, subsequently ordered special revision for the Chakmas and Hajongs of Arunachal Pradesh on March 31, 2003.																								Even after the order of the Election Commission of India, none of the Chakmas and Hajongs have been enrolled into the electoral rolls on frivolous grounds. At the time of writing of this report, the final outcome of the special revision was not announced.																								Case 2: Stateless Mohajirs in Hyderabad since 1948: 																								*About 130 families Mohajir (refugees) basti located just behind Mecca Masjid of Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh have remained stateless since 1948. They migrated to the city in 1948 following riots in Bihar and Gulbarga in Pakistan. Fifty-six years on, the Mohajirs and their children remain stateless. They continue to be slum dwellers without access to proper sanitary facilities and continue to live in semi-pucca houses.																								On August 14, 2002, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu visited the area. The chief minister gave some hope to the Mohajirs. The Hyderabad collector was asked to build pucca houses free of cost without any delay. It was decided to construct the houses under the Valmiki Ambedkar Awas Yojana. Steps were initiated to acquire land from the Minority Welfare Commission and the Wakf Board. As of August 23, 2003, nothing has happened. The children of these Mohajirs remain stateless until today.

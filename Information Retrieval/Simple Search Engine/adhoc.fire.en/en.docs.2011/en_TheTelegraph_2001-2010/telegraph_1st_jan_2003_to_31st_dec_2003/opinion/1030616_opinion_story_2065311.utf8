		 Monday, June 16, 2003  BUYING BEHAVIOUR
 - Consumption as an excellent reflector of social change in  India  Commentarao / S.L. Rao The author is former director- general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission raoslhotmail.com Purchases by households of cassette  recorders fell in 1998-99 and have been falling sharply  since 1996-97; that of table fans has been relatively static  since 1994-95; that of motor cycles has been growing faster  than scooters, but more scooters were bought than motor  cycles even in 1999-2000; growth in purchases of pressure  cookers and VCR/VCPs has been good but black and white television  sets have been static while colour television purchases  have been booming since 1995-96; sewing machines have again  begun to grow since 1995-96. Rural purchases account for  over 70 per cent of purchases of bicycles, portable radios,  sewing machines, black and white television sets and mechanical  wrist watches.  Financing of purchases for white  goods has come down from 25 per cent in 1992-93 to 16 per  cent in 1998-99. The decline is inexplicable especially  since the purchase of white goods has grown by around 19  per cent per annum over the Nineties. Among consumable products  there has been a slowing down in purchases of cooking oils  and vanaspati, hair oils and creams, tea, toilet soap, tooth  powder and washing powder. High growth continues for footwear  of all kinds, packaged biscuits, and toothpaste and washing  cake. Over 55 per cent of purchases are from rural India  for cigarettes, cooking oils, footwear, hair oils, shampoos,  tea, toilet soap, tooth powder, washing cake and washing  powder. Could it be that consumers are downgrading their  purchases of consumables so as to buy durable and white  goods?  The data is available by income  categories, towns, urban and rural India, occupational classes  and regions of India. There is a wealth of information about  the changing lifestyles of households and the data should  be a dream for sociologists and economists. Unfortunately,  it is mainly business people who have mined this data over  the years, to their profit. Our intellectuals have a snobbish  attitude to consumption and have shown little interest in  analyzing the implications of the trends thrown up by this  data.  The scorecard of Indias income  distribution, product purchase penetration and market leadership  now available till 1998-99 is from the market information  survey of households that the National Council for Applied  Economic Research has been bringing out since 1985. These  data have, over the years, been responsible for attracting  enormous investor interest in India. It has changed the  perception of poverty-stricken India. Despite poverty it  constitutes a vast and fast-growing market.  The NCAER started the market survey  of households in 1985 and has released it irregularly from  1991. It used a huge sample size of 500,000 and covered  every district in India. No survey other than the National  Sample Survey had conducted such large surveys ever  before. The latest survey has a sample size of 272,944 in  809 villages and 515 towns for durable consumer goods and  25,221 for expendable consumer goods, a total of almost  300,000. The rising penetration of purchase of consumer  products has enabled a reduction in sample sizes.  The NSS was a product of  the asceticism of Indias political and intellectual leadership  in the Fifties. Purchases of manufactured consumer goods  were not significant in understanding changing lifestyles.  The interest was in calories consumed. Dandekar and Rath  used NSS data in 1971 to develop a calorie-consumption-based  measure for poverty in India. This measure is still in use,  although the consumption basket has changed radically for  most people and the relevance of that poverty measure is  now being questioned.  Some well-known economists criticized  the NCAER-MISH data. Some said that it was impossible to  manage data from such a huge sample; there were bound to  be enormous sampling and non-sampling errors  that is,  false entries; respondents were unlikely to give correct  answers and at least some of the responses on income and  expenditure would have been cooked up. But NCAER persevered  despite the great financial burden. It was tempted many  times to give up, but the data was unique and no one else  could do it. The difficulty was the inability  of NCAER, like so many research and academic institutions,  to market it and find new customers. The costs were more  than the revenue earned from a few forward-looking companies  like Lever and Hawkins who pioneered in the use of this  data for marketing. For a few years, the planning commission  gave the effort some financial support because of the extraordinary  value of the data. But that support stopped by 1993.  The NCAER, struggling as it was  to pay its staff salaries each month, continued by economizing  on costs. The sample size was reduced without affecting  data quality adversely; sub-contracting of data collection  under rigorous supervision also helped to reduce cost; farming  out data entry helped. The media found the data interesting  and publicized it. Worldwide interest was aroused when NCAER  began to release data by income categories on product ownership  and purchase. With the hype about a reforming India, data  on the size and penetration of purchase gave investors an  idea of the potentials in Indian markets.  The changing income patterns were  a revelation for most. The revealed dimensions of the Indian  market transformed the perception of India as a country  with abysmal poverty and low levels of income whose people  barely got enough to eat and could never afford to buy manufactured  consumer goods. The poor were now seen as a huge market  if products were designed and priced for them. NCAER used  the large sample to shed light on household financial investments,  health expenditures, and so on. The latest report for 1998-99  just released, is four years after the event. This is common.  NCAER must urgently review its methods for data collection  and analysis and find ways to speed up the release so that  the data is not old history but describes the immediate  past. These surveys have become primarily  a source for understanding the changing income distribution  by states, large towns, social classes, and so on. As in  past years, there is a distinct upward movement in income  levels. The proportion of the poorest at the bottom is falling,  and more sharply in urban than in rural India. The proportion  of households in the highest income levels is rising fastest,  although the actual numbers of households is still relatively  small. The east continues to show the slowest change in  improved income distribution. The proportions of households  amongst the bottom and the higher levels of income are improving  much more slowly. Consumable products seem to be growing  more slowly than durables. It would be useful to see if  there is a switch to cheaper local products versus  those of the multinational companies. MISH-information on product purchase  gives a graphic picture of the materialism of the Indian  consumer. He is no different from others around the world.  MISH collects data on brand shifts but does not share it.  It gives information on the increasing use of borrowings  to finance purchases, the buying behaviour among different  classes, and thus enables an understanding of the tremendous  socio-economic upheavals taking place as incomes rise and  people climb the consumption ladder.  We have for long been misled by  the data from the NSS which has appeared to show that poverty  levels have remained high even in the Nineties. But NCAER  data shows that even many below the poverty line buy soap  and own transistor radios, mono-cassette recorders, and  so on. The Dandekar-Rath concept of poverty in India developed  in 1972 is no longer relevant. We have to find newer definitions  for poverty and they must include an understanding of changing  dietary habits and of other consumption. T his data merits close study  by social psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists and  economists. One must only lament the poverty of our humanities  teaching and research that we do not consider consumption  as an excellent reflector of change.

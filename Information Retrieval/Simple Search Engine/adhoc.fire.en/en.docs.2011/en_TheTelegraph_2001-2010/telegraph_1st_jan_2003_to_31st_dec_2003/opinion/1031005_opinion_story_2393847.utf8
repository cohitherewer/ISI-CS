		 Sunday, October 05, 2003  COMMUNISMS OTHER BASTION
 - In spite of similarities, West Bengal cannot match Kerala  in development  RAMACHANDRA GUHA ramguhavsnl.com			Far aheadIt is hard for an Indian of my  generation to call Calcutta Kolkata, and harder still for  him to refer to Trivandrum as Thiruvananthapuram. Bengals  capital I know well, having spent five years there as a  young man. But I recently made my first trip to Keralas  capital. This is a charming town of old tiled houses and  curving roads, situated at the southern edge of the state.  Trivandrum was once the capital of the princely state of  Travancore-Cochin, whose ruling dynasty, the Varmas, had  a marked talent for the arts. (Raja Ravi Varma belonged  to the family, while their wooden palace in Padmanabhapura  is one of the wonders of late medieval architecture.) My first visit to Kerala, to the  industrial centre of Cochin, was at the invitation of that  remarkable peoples science group, the Kerala Sastra Sahitya  Parishad. KSSP is a non-profit organization that runs itself  through the proceeds of the books and pamphlets it publishes.  My second visit, to the village of Thiruvala, was to attend  a meeting convened by the followers of the liberation theologian,  M.M. Thomas. The present visit to Trivandrum was at the  invitation of DC Books, who are the states largest commercial  publishing house, and also own a chain of bookshops. Thus  on each of the three occasions I have been in Kerala I was  placed in the midst of writers and intellectuals, arguing,  arguing, arguing. It is hardly surprising that I was reminded  of my days as a doctoral student in Calcutta. As in Bengal, in Kerala too books  and ideas are taken very seriously indeed. These are probably  the only two bilingual intellectual cultures in India. In  Trivandrum I met Paul Zachariah, a masterful short story  writer in Malayalam who also writes well crafted essays  in English. I also met the veteran historian M.G.S. Narayanan,  who publishes his research papers in English but is also  a prolific contributor to the Malayalam press. Like his  Calcutta counterpart, the Trivandrum writer and scholar  lives simultaneously in his locality and in the world. He  knows his Vallathol and his Basheer, but also his Foucault  and his Sartre. (As in Bengal, there is here a noticeable  enthusiasm for French thinkers as opposed to Anglo-Saxon  ones.) Both states also have an enduring  tradition of art cinema. The cinema opposite my hotel was  showing the latest film of Adoor Gopalakrishnan, an exploration  of late colonial India through the eyes of a hangman. In  the Hindi cinema, the days of Shyam Benegal and company  are a fading memory. In Tamil and Telugu films the bottom  line has always ruled. But in Kerala, like in Bengal, there  is still space for the innovative director who makes films  which provoke but do not necessarily sell. In both states, thinkers and creative  artists divide themselves into rival camps. Thus Paul Zachariah  describes himself as a man of the left. The historian  M.G.S. Narayanan, on the other hand, is best described as  a man of the anti-left. Of course, there are various shades  of opinion within each camp, but the fundamental axis of  division remains the relation to Marxism. For one set of  intellectuals, this philosophy is both enlightening and  emancipatory; for the other, it is constraining and dogmatic. This polarization is a consequence  of the hegemonic role in both states of the Communist Party.  The undivided Communist Party of India came to office in  Kerala in 1957; over the next forty-five years it has been  in and out of office. The state has a stable two-front system,  one alliance led by the Communist Party of India (Marxists),  the other by the Congress. In West Bengal, the communists  first tasted power only in the late Sixties. But from 1977  they have never been in opposition. In both Kerala and West Bengal  the communists have tried not merely to define the terms  of cultural debate, but also to control it. It is now widely  recognized that senior appointments in West Bengals universities  are decided upon by Alimuddin Street. In Kerala the party  headquarters, the A.K.G. Centre in Trivandrum, plays a very  similar role. However, its influence is limited in comparison,  if only because in every alternate election the communists  are thrown out of office. The vigour and vitality of intellectual  life, its effortless bilingualism, the salience of the left   all these make Kerala akin to Bengal. One could add other  similarities, such as the absence of communal strife, or,  on the negative side, the power of the trade unions which  has led in both states to a flight of capital. But there  are also some fundamental areas of divergence. One is social  composition. While both states have a large Muslim population,  Kerala also has a wealthy and influential Christian minority.  The other is social development  while Kerala has an outstanding  record in education and health, Bengal has fared rather  poorly in this regard. Success has many fathers, said  John F. Kennedy. Thus angels of all kinds have rushed in  to claim credit for the Kerala miracle: for the fact that  the state has almost 100 per cent of its female population  literate, the fact that its population growth rate is the  lowest in India, the fact that its health facilities are  better than in the United States of America. The Travancore  ruling family liked to say that it devoted more energies  to education than other Indian princes, by, for instance,  sending women doctors and nurses abroad for training. The  dominant caste of the Nairs is not shy of staking its claim  either. The Nairs are matrilineal, with women inheriting  and running family properties; this is said to have made  it easier to send little girls to schools. Then there are  the Christian missionaries, who believe that they brought  an enlightened modern perspective through the colleges and  hospitals they run in Kerala. The previously oppressed caste  of Ezhavas point to the movement of social reform led by  their great leader Sree Narayana Guru, which first generated  the atmosphere of equality that now pervades the state.  Finally, there are the communists, who argue that it was  they who created true equality of opportunity, through thoroughgoing  land reforms which removed the power of the old landed elite. The best discussion of the Kerala  miracle is to be found in Robin Jeffreys book, Politics,  Women and Wellbeing. There, the contributions of these  varied streams  feudal progressiveness, Nair matriliny,  Christian charity, Ezhava assertion, and communist redistribution   are carefully weighed and assessed. A rather different  take on the subject was offered by that brilliant, maverick  environmentalist, the late Anil Agarwal. The reason why  girls go to school in Kerala, said Agarwal, was because  of the super-abundance of wood and water. For in other parts  of India the girl-child is expected to help her mother gather  fuel for the stove and water for the household. In arid  or hilly regions these tasks can take up to four hours:  that is, the entire morning, which the boys spend in school.  But in Kerala there is green cover all around, and plenty  of water too. It is Mother Nature, not Political Culture,  that frees the women from these tasks, allowing them to  be educated and to work, to choose when to get married and  how many children to have. Now the interesting thing, pace  Anil Agarwal, is that West Bengal is as richly endowed by  nature as Kerala. There is water everywhere, and wood almost  everywhere. Why then does it have an altogether modest record  in education, health and womens rights? The Congress, whether  Trinamool or orthodox, claim that the problem lies in the  tyranny of left rule. And the communists shift the blame  to the government of India  Centre kom diyechhe,  they say. Such, for the past two decades and more, has been  the blame-game of Bengali politics. The rhetoric brings  to mind the second part of John F. Kennedys famous statement.  Remember that while success has many fathers, failure is  an orphan.

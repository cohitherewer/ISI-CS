		 Monday, September 01, 2003  THE CAG AND THE PRIME MINISTER
 - While an audit must find fault, it must also look at performance  S. VENKITARAMANAN The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India Recent events in Parliament have  highlighted the importance of the system of governmental  audit in India. The fracas about the public accounts committee  particularly emphasizes the importance of audit reports.  The comptroller and auditor-general of India is an important  constitutional authority. He enjoys considerable constitutional  safeguards in recognition of the importance of his role. Audit reports, by definition,  partake of the nature of fault-finding. The CAGs reports  in India have also occasionally irked and irritated the  government in power. An episode of such a nature between  the CAG and the government was the one which unravelled  irregularities with regard to the purchase of jeeps in London,  when the late V.K. Krishna Menon was Indias high commissioner.  The then CAG was A.K. Chanda, another favourite of Jawaharlal  Nehru. Nehru was caught on the horns of a dilemma, but weathered  the debate on the audit report and carried the matter to  its illogical conclusion. Krishna Menons bona fides  were never in question. The CAG also established his credentials  as an authority set up to explore and find out irregularities.  It speaks volumes for the democratic traditions, which Nehru  established, that the CAGs personal motives were never  questioned. Recently, the CAG was at the receiving  end of very strong criticism from the prime minister, Atal  Bihari Vajpayee. In an address to the annual conference  of accountant-generals of India, Vajpayee bemoaned the tendency  of audit reports to concentrate on fault-finding. He felt  that the existing audit system has reduced the executive  to becoming a prisoner of procedures rather than an achiever  of purpose. He further expressed the view that managers  have been complaining that the present system has inbuilt  disincentives for taking commercial decisions in a timely  manner. The overwhelming fear of possible audit remarks  forced most of them to play it safe and take shelter under  procedures and technicalities. While the spirit of the prime  ministers objections to the current practices of audit  is right, it is possible to argue that audit by its very  nature has to concentrate on finding faults. An audit, which  only looks at merely the question of whether a fair and  true presentation of accounts has been made, does not look  into questions of propriety. Parliament has cast on the  CAG the far higher responsibility of looking into the propriety  of actions of the executives from the financial point of  view. It is inevitable that an auditor who raises these  issues has to end up finding faults. Audit reports are the  analogue of drain inspectors reports. The CAG is bound  to find fault where it exists. At the same time, it is fair to  recognize that audit has tended to be focussed more on processes  rather than on content. Auditors tend to look at whether  proper procedures have been followed rather than at whether  any deviations from procedures may have achieved a purpose  in a more efficient manner. Audit, as is presently constituted,  tends to be directionally in favour of those executives  who have followed procedures and rules in letter rather  than in spirit. Fear of audit objections exhibits  itself in executives of governmental organizations being  unwilling to take a decision which deviates from rules even  if justified by facts. This is particularly true in respect  of purchase decisions, which are often the focus of audit  reports. Governmental decisions on purchases are overwhelmed  by the principle of buying the cheapest. The lower tender  then scores even at the expense of quality. Calculations  justifying a slightly higher price in return for a better  quality are viewed with suspicion by auditors. While it  is true that of late auditors have become better-equipped  to understand the technical justifications for such variations  from buying the cheapest but buying the best, the fear of  being pursued by audit and consequential recoveries haunts  the executives.  The answer to this will have to  be better education of the executives about audit procedures  and auditors about the complexities which confront an executive  taking a purchase decision. This is particularly true in  respect of defence purchases, where arguments of efficiency  and cost effectiveness are often clouded in a mist of continuing  technical arguments. The PAC, which has recently audited  defence transactions, may be very well justified in asking  for a copy of the report sent to the Central vigilance commission,  if such a report exists. There have been doubts cast on  the very existence of the report. But it goes without saying  that the CAG, as a constitutional authority, is entitled  to information no less than any other authority of the government,  including the CVC. The PAC is well within the limits to  ask for documents, which are stated to be confidential.  What is not confidential to the CVC cannot be confidential  with reference to PAC. The root cause of delays and inefficiencies  in government is not, however, so much the audit as the  fear of continuous pursuit by other agencies of invigilation,  such as the CVC and the Central Bureau of Investigation.  One of the senior ministers of the government of India recently  referred to this combination of inspectorates as three Cs,  which hamper decision-making in government. I had already  referred to the paralysis of decision-making in defence  in my earlier piece published in this newspaper. The remedy  for this is not to attack audit per se, but to insulate  the bona fide decisions of executives of government from  continuous pursuit by invigilators once it is established  that the decision has been taken keeping in view all procedures  and practices.  A possible solution has to be  found by subjecting such cases of alleged deviations to  a committee of experts, which should include a serving or  recently retired officer of defence, a judicial representative  and an eminent person of integrity, who should go into the  merits of the transactions without over-emphasizing the  procedural aspects. It should then be decided that if the  transactions otherwise justify the decision, motives should  not be attributed to the officers involved. This applies  as much to the ministers as to the officers. Audit reports have particularly  greater potential for doing harm in respect of commercial  undertakings in which the government has a controlling share.  In our approach to reforming the structure of audit, we  have to emphasize more the need for inculcating efficiency  in the public sector or such elements of the public sector  which remain after the current process of disinvestment.  Public sector units are treated as a state in respect  of Article 12 of the Constitution of India by virtue of  control by the government. The approach to improving the  efficiency of the public sector cannot confine itself only  to reducing the rigors of audit. If we aim at a level-playing  field between the public sector and the private sector,  we have to ensure that the rigors of audit and inspections  by the CBI and CVC are reduced in respect of PSUs. While a discussion on the means  of improving the efficiency of the PSUs is beyond the scope  of this article, it is important to emphasize that one has  to think radically about the issue if the purpose of eliminating  inefficiency is to be met. One way out may be to delimit  the scope of constitutional safeguards under Article 12  in respect of PSUs, which have to meet competition in the  commercial field. The judgment of Justice Shamim of the  Delhi high court in the case of Maruti Udyog Limited (1991)  is significant in this regard. I quote: Although Maruti  Udyog had a majority of its Directors appointed by Government,  it was outside the scope of Article (12) to the extent of  its agreement with Suzuki since there was bound to be control  by the collaborator.  This opens a space for similarly  differentiating between PSUs in the matter of openness to  public interest litigation and the like in respect of hiring  and firing as well as purchase decisions. This is the only  way we can make our public sector have a level-playing field  with the private sector. There is no point in targeting  the CAG alone in this regard. While it is true that audit cannot  eliminate emphasis on fault-finding, it has also to change  its ways, which go beyond procedures. It should become more  genuinely a management audit, which emphasizes performance  rather than observance of rules and regulations. This requires  a different mindset among auditors as well as among administrators.  Whether the CAG can become a management auditor of government  is a matter which calls for further examination from the  constitutional perspective. The criticism that the prime minister  has levelled against the current procedure of audit has  come at an appropriate time. While it has naturally received  considerable attention in view of the current debacle in  Parliament, it is important in itself. The prime minister  has rightly initiated a debate on the role of audit. The prime minister has posed an  important challenge before the auditors. The CAG has to  re- invent his role so as to serve a national cause of achieving  efficiency with financial integrity. A national debate on  the role of the constitutional authority, such as the CAG,  is both timely and appropriate.

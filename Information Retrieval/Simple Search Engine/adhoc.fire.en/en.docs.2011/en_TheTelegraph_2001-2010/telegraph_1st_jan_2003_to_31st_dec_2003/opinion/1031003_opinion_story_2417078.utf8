The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, October 03, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																A chronicle of authority refutedThe following story (Harvill,   3.95) by Cees Nooteboom is an enchantingly  told fable about Herman Mussert, who went to bed last night  in Amsterdam but wakes up in a hotel room in Portugal where  twenty years before he slept with another mans wife. Therefore,  is he himself? It is a brilliantly comic story, richly allusive  and gamesome, playing wittily with past and present, first,  second and third person. Those who like reading Calvino  will also like this writer. Originally in Dutch, this novella  had won the European Literature Prize, and is here consummately  translated by Ina Rilke. Nooteboom is a major European writer,  and it is refreshing to read a lighthearted, yet intellectually  stimulating European storyteller who is neither British  nor Indo-Anglian. The definitive guide to screen  writing (Ebury,  9) by Syd Field is a  very practical guide to screenplay-writing, by somebody  who has been described  by CNN  as the guru of all screenwriters.  Hollywood swears by him, and he has a formidable academic  career as well. Yes, I can truly say, Field writes in  the introduction, I was a child of Hollywood.  Icons from the world of sports  (Puffin, Rs 175) by Gulu Ezekiel presents  a gallery of portraits  verbal and visual  of the brightest  stars of Indian sports who (sic) are still playing  today. There are other volumes in the series covering business  and science. The heroes of this volume are Tendulkar, Paes  amp; Bhupathi, Milkha Singh, Bhutia, Anjali Bhagwat, Pillay,  Gopichand, Viswanathan Anand and Malleswari. My little boat (Penguin,  Rs 275) by Mariam Karim is criture le femme   reminiscent of Hlne Cixous and Woolfs Between  the Acts  set in post-Pokhran, post-Babri-Masjid UP.  Superimposed upon this Indian location are layers of dislocated  memories. The writing is deliberately fragmented, generically  mixed up, and often quite competently and poetically mad.  Qamrun Bua was mad, everyone knew, best of all her husband,  Moosa. Her exaggerated expressions and hyperbolic speech  bore testimony to the fact. But her biriyani itself  was a hyperbole in gourmet terms, for the taste of which  she was forgiven her linguistic indiscretions. Autism Spectrum Disorders: The complete guide (Vermilion,   5.20) by Chantal Sicile-Kira is a remarkably  useful and engaging book, and might open up new vistas of  awareness for Indian readers. It gives the general public,  professionals and parents a better understanding of the autism/Asperger  spectrum, as well as providing lists of resources useful to  those who are on the spectrum, and those who work and care  for them. Living in three different countries and challenging  the status quo in each one has developed my resourcefulness,  creative thinking and negotiating skills to a level I never  dreamed possible. Having a child with autism is challenging,  but building all the family, educational, medical and community  support systems needed is the real challenge. And everyone  has a responsible part in this, not just the parents. One  of her epigraphs, by an unknown author, reads: The history  of mans progress is a chronicle of authority refuted.  Her story so far: Tales of  the girl child in india (Penguin, Rs 200) edited  by Monica Das is an anthology of short stories. These  stories, writes Das, celebrate the spirit of the girl  child and her determination to keep hope alive, even when  they describe the dismal prospects that surround her. Mahasweta  Devi, Ashapurna Devi, Amrita Pritam, Ambai, Ismat Chughtai  and Kamala Das are among the writers included.

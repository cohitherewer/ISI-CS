 - India and Pakistan should take substantive steps to make  meaningful dialogue possible  J.N. DIXIT The author is former foreign secretary  of India Six weeks have gone by since the  offer of the Indian prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee,  to resume the dialogue with Pakistan. It has got a reticently  positive response from Pakistan. The media, as usual, proceeded  to be enthusiastic about break-throughs and new beginnings.  It is worthwhile undertaking a reality check on what has  happened since Vajpayees offer of a dialogue and the response  of the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, welcoming  the offer. The international community has  generally welcomed the initiative. Whatever the governments  of India and Pakistan may say, a certain amount of tactful  but insistent pressure from the United States of America,  the precedent of pre-emptive intrusive action in the US  invasion of Iraq and public pronouncements by US officials  that south Asia is nuclearly the most dangerous area in  the world, impelled the Vajpayee initiative and the Pakistani  response. While Pakistan has had no hesitation in accepting  the reality of this pressure, the government of India continues  to pretend that there was no such pressure. We seem to have  a pathological aversion towards acknowledging the impact  of realpolitik in inter-state relations. It is good to see the US being  sensitive to Indian complexes. There have been repeated  assurances by US officials that they do not envisage playing  a mediatory role. The government of Pakistan initially gave  its game away by converting dialogue into a publicity exercise.  The Pakistani prime minister, Mir Zafrullah Khan Jamali,  suggested an early summit with Vajpayee despite the unfortunate  experience that both the countries had gone through at Lahore  in February 1999 and at Agra in July 2001.  Indias response that the dialogue  should be a structured and gradual process bestowed practicality  to the initiative. Jamali announced Pakistans willingness  to expand bilateral trade within the framework of the South  Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, to restore bilateral  civil aviation contacts and restore diplomatic relations  at the level of high commissioners. Each one of these offers  was a repetition of what India had offered Pakistan in order  to restore normalcy in bilateral relations last October  and November, as India decided to pull back its armed forces  from its forward deployment positions. Both countries have now designated  high commissioners to each others capitals. Shiv Shanker  Menon, our ambassador to China, is to proceed to Islamabad,  and Aziz Ahmed Khan, former Pakistani ambassador to the  taliban government in Afghanistan and now a spokesman of  the Pakistan foreign office, have been designated high commissioners.  Being personally acquainted with  both these diplomats, I am clear that the choice has been  not only appropriate but careful and measured. These are  individuals of temperament who will be nodal points in structuring  bilateral relations at this sensitive and critical juncture.  Both are sober, non-political and practical officers. Knowledgeable  about the foreign policies of their countries, and firmly  committed to their national interests, they are known for  their patience, tact and practical approach in negotiations.  It was obvious that there was  some differences of opinion within the Pakistani establishment  as to who should come as the Pakistan high commissioner.  The names mentioned were Maleeha Lodhi and Riaz Ahmed Khan.  Lodhi and Riaz Ahmed Khan have a record of assertive anti-Indianism  in recent years. Jamali, in fact, publicly announced Riaz  Ahmed Khans name, which was later contradicted by the government  of Pakistan. Musharrafs final choice is Aziz Ahmed Khan,  who is no less firm about Pakistani policies. But he has  two advantages. He has served in New Delhi as deputy high  commissioner and director general, south Asia, in the Pakistan  foreign office. Secondly, he is not confrontationist in  his style of diplomacy when compared to some of his predecessors  in New Delhi. So one can draw the conclusion  that Pakistan wants the process of dialogue to continue  without controversies in its initial stages. India has responded to the suggestion  about re-activating trade relations with a sense of detachment,  stating that these relations can evolve, depending on Pakistans  attitudes, for the present. It is obvious that Pakistan  still has reticences about full-scale trade relations. The  bus service between Lahore and Amritsar has been restored  but neither side has yet given clear indications about restoring  the train services  the Samjhauta Express.  As far as restoring civil aviation  links go, Pakistan has only agreed to restoration of flights  between India and Pakistan (perhaps Delhi-Lahore, Delhi-Karachi  and Bombay-Karachi). While India has suggested in addition  the restoring of overflight facilities, Pakistan is procrastinating  over a decision on the matter. Could it be that Pakistan  wants to exploit the fact that lack of overflight facilities  costs India much more than it does Pakistan  and it is  an argument of Pakistanis that after all it was India which  started this punitive action. Track-II diplomacy has been revived  as a result of non-governmental initiatives. A Pakistani  parliamentary delegation visited India in May. Indian members  of parliament and academics have visited Pakistan over the  last six weeks. Pugwash organized a conference on south  Asian security, Indo-Pakistan relations and the Kashmir  issue, in Geneva in the middle of May. There were representatives  from the thinktanks of India and Pakistan, as well as some  Western academics at this conference. Interestingly, the  Pakistan delegation was a high level one with the former  foreign minister, Abdul Sattar, as participant.  More interesting was the presence  of serving officers from the Pakistani army and the Pakistan  foreign office at this conference. Pakistans high commissioner-designate  to India, Aziz Ahmed Khan, was at this conference. It is  noteworthy that in these Track II discussions, the Kashmir  problem was not projected head on as a controversial issue.  The approach was to acknowledge the importance of the issue  and to discuss possible options for a solution. Perhaps  a good sign; though one did not see any dilution of the  basic stance on Jammu and Kashmir, on the part of India  and Pakistan, even at these non-official discussions.  Prospects of meaningful and substantive  moves towards resolving India-Pakistan disputes have been  put in doubt in a statement made by Musharraf in the last  week of May that whenever India-Pakistan summit takes place,  it will be between Jamali and Vajpayee. The rationale given  by Musharraf is that he does not want to be a roadblock  in negotiations. As far as Indias perceptions go, this  detachment from talks by Musharraf indicates his keeping  his options open about pulling back from the negotiations  and disowning Jamali as Junejo was disowned by General Zia-ul-Haq.  Everybody knows that Musharraf  is the ultimate deciding authority in Pakistan. In fact,  it is he who should have called Vajpayee and not Jamali.  As long as Musharraf remains executive president, his pretending  to delegate the negotiating authority to Jamali to establish  Pakistans democratic credentials, is at best a cosmetic  gesture and at worst it only increases Indias apprehensions  about Musharrafs real intentions. Vajpayee in his discussions with  the US deputy secretary of state, Richard Armitage, with  the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, and with the US  president, George Bush, has underlined that a dialogue can  move on to substantive issues when Pakistan stops supporting  cross-border terrorism. Infiltration and violence continue  in Jammu and Kashmir. Externally sponsored separatist militants  are politically becoming incrementally defensive with the  growing credibility of the Mufti government supported by  the Congress. The Hurriyat is in disarray, which  may make the jihadis across the border more desperate.  There is a need to be alert about this, as they can disrupt  the process of a dialogue. Bush promised to speak to Musharraf  when the latter visits Washington in June to be more purposeful  in stopping cross-border terrorism. He gave this assurance  to Vajpayee at St. Petersburg on May 31. Anticipating pressure  from the US, Musharraf has taken some concrete steps to  curb jihadis in his country. The Jamait-e-Islami has expelled  the Hizbul Mujaheddin from its offices. The Jaish-e-Mohammed  and the Lashkar-e-Toiba have been subjected to official  restraint over the last three weeks. Militants like Masood  Azhar have been prevented from their public activities.  One hopes that this is the beginning of Pakistan dissociating  itself from these terrorist organizations, though one is  not very optimistic. There are indications that middle  level officials from both countries may commence discussions  on the agenda for official level dialogue. Meanwhile, some  further steps to buttress the process could be taken by  both the governments. Full civil aviation facilities should  be restored, the train service between the two countries  should be revived, sports and cultural contacts could be  re-initiated. The hot lines between the prime ministers,  the foreign secretaries and the directors-general, military  operations, could be fully re-activated. The confidence  building measures agreed upon between 1989 and 1996 should  be brought back into operation. Most important, both parties  could take the major decision of convening the joint experts  group on nuclear risk reduction, agreed upon in Lahore in  February 1999. The path ahead will have hurdles,  will have disruptions. India and Pakistan should make haste  slowly but in the interim should not hesitate to take substantive  steps to underpin the process of a dialogue.

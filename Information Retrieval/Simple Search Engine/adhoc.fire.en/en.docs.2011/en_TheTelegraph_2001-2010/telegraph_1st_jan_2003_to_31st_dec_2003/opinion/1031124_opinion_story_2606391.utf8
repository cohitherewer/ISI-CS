		 Monday, November 24, 2003  ITS NEVER TOO EASY
 - Why is starting a business made so difficult in India?  S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India  Jumping hurdles  The World Bank has done a signal  service to the cause of development by coming out with a  report, Doing Business 2003, which analyses the different  procedures and bottlenecks in countries faced by businessmen  around the world. It describes quite clearly the range in  regulatory and other bottle-necks faced by business in poorer  countries as compared to the richer ones. This variation  explains why non-residents from poorer countries flourish  better in the environment of their adopted affluent countries,  like the United Kingdom and the United States of America.  The procedures for starting, running and getting out of  business are more cumbersome, costly and time-consuming  in the less-developed countries compared to the richer ones.  That is why the former stay less-developed. The report points out how the  number of procedures, the time taken and costs incurred  in starting a business in India are much higher than in  the US or UK. In an instructive table, the report of the  World Bank points out that it takes 10 procedures and 50  times the Indian per capita gross domestic product to start  a business in India, whereas in the US the number of procedures  is just 5, in the UK it is just 6. The costs are also significantly  lower in relative terms  just 27 times per capita GDP in  the US and an amount equal to per capita GDP in the UK.  What is more interesting is the time taken. In the UK, it  takes 18 days and in the US 4 days, while in India it takes  88 days. China scores better than India, in that it takes  12 procedures, 14 times the per capita GDP and 46 days.  Still, a long way to go even for China to compete with the  US or UK. Why should we in India make it  so difficult to start a business? Regulations require the  entrepreneur to comply with so many rules, partly in order  to satisfy the requirement of security and adequate qualifications.  Information sought from a businessman has to be provided,  once to the tax collector and separately to the company  law, Factory Act and labour law functionaries. In these  days, when information technology is increasingly resorted  to, it should be possible to have one registration do all  the functions. Information can be collected at one source.  Besides, it is an intriguing question as to what use all  the information is put to, once provided, except to have  the smooth functioning of enterprise hindered by intrusive  inspectors, who come for their collections. Businessmen in developing countries  face innumerable obstacles. The talk of a single window  clearance is just that  so much talk. There is need to  go behind the functions of each clearance and streamline  them. It is also necessary to reduce the impact of the inspector  raj  which is the declared objective of many governments. Equally important from the point  of view of the entrepreneur is the number race. Intending  businessmen have to lay out their business plans before  bankers, who often take their own time in their scrutiny.  There is no encouragement to be proactive and to help intending  borrowers. This is, of course, an outcome of the current  environment of suspicion, which pitchforks a friendly banker  into the clutches of investigative officials  if he ever  so much as helps a borrower to complete his formalities  in quick time. It is often suggested that expeditious clearance  of borrowers requests is itself a cause for suspicion.  Delay in clearances is twice-blessed. It helps the banker  in many ways. It also avoids any suspicion of collusion.  The time has come for the central bank to benchmark speed  of decision-making as a touchstone for bankers efficiency,  in dealing with proposals from intending businessmen. The World Bank report devotes  considerable attention to the complex issues of regulation.  It points out that the successful countries have a more  efficient system of regulation. Poorer countries have more  complex regulations, even though they lack the expert staff  to understand and implement regulations. In a pertinent  passage, the report outlines certain essential elements  in business regulations, which are as follows: simplify  and deregulate competitive markets; to continue regulation  when competition can do the trick is superfluous; focus  on enhancing rights; expand the use of technology; reduce  court involvement in business matters; and make reform a  continuous process. The report is also perspicacious  in pointing out that care should be taken to reduce the  role of the judiciary in matters of regulation. It pertinently  points out that when regulatory matters go to the judiciary,  it is often handled by judges without the benefit of technical  expertise, which, ostensibly, regulators have. In any event,  this observation is pertinent with reference to countries,  like India, where many regulatory matters tend to end up  in the courts, overburdening an already overworked judiciary  and making for a complex regulatory settlement. The point is made in the World  Bank report that quite often, countries carry the baggage  of their ex-colonial masters, although the former colonial  powers have already reformed radically the procedures of  business regulation in their own countries. Witness the  UK and France, which have simplified their procedures substantially,  although their old colonies are still struggling with the  complexities of their legacy. It is an implicit recommendation  of the report that countries should re-examine their procedures  for regulating enterprises with a view to making them more  business-friendly. In a telling passage, the report  quotes from the famous writings of the author, Hernando  de Soto, of Peru: Prohibitively high cost of establishing  a business in Peru denies economic opportunity to the poor.  In 1983, de Sotos research team followed all the bureaucratic  procedures in setting up a one-employee garment factory  in the outskirts of Lima. Two hundred and eighty nine days  and $ 1231 later, the factory could legally start operation.  The cost amounted to three years wages  not the kind of  money the average Peruvian entrepreneur has at his or her  disposal. The message of the quote is telling. The urgency  for simplifying procedures for start-up of enterprise is  obvious. The only defect with this otherwise  well-structured report is that it has not concentrated sufficiently  on the questions of easier access to credit. However, it  makes the obvious point that in more developed countries,  there is a greater access for borrowers to credit information  either in the public or private domain. Bankers are able  to understand the credit status of the prospective borrowers.  There is also the existence of better safeguards for creditors  rights. We are still a long way from enforcing such rights  quickly. The success of macroeconomic reforms  depends a great deal on the presence of a business-friendly  environment. The World Bank report highlights many features  of the business infrastructure in which countries, like  India, are lacking. Economic reform cannot be a success  unless millions of small and medium-scale entrepreneurs  come forward to invest and start new enterprises. It is  time we focus on creating a favourable environment for the  entrepreneurs to flourish. This requires a multi-dimensional  approach. Improvement in labour laws is one important ingredient,  if enterprises are to be enabled to start and exit businesses  without much hassle. The much-awaited labour reforms have  to be expedited. Equally, the inspector raj has to be simplified  and made more business-friendly. It is time that our policy-makers  take the task of structural reform seriously and help to  readjust the bureaucratic framework of regulation and control  so as to facilitate businessmen to start and run enterprises  without going through too much of a hurdle-race. While it  is too much to expect a transition to a dream-world like  the one in developed countries, it is time that we initiate  a change in the slow and costly procedures of approvals  and restrictions. The days of licence and permit  raj are reportedly over. But their influence still remains.  The long hand of bureaucracy continues to intervene in the  running of business, under the ostensible cover of labour  laws, environment and so on. It is essential that we make  the entire process much more user-friendly and less costly  and time-consuming. Only then can enterprise truly flourish  in India. The World Bank report would do  a useful service if it opens the governments eyes to the  problems that businesses face in India. It is to be hoped  that advice from the World Bank is not rejected on the usual  ground of prejudice against the Bretton Woods institutions.  In this case, it is definitely a dispassionate study the  Bank has made. Its recommendations should not be rejected  on the facile ground of not being invented here. Good advice  should be welcomed even from the World Bank  even if we  claim that we do not need its financial aid any more.

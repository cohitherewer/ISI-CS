		 Sunday, July 27, 2003  PORTRAIT OF REINI
 - To and fro in darkest Europe  TELLING TALES / AMIT CHAUDHURI amitchaudhurihotmail.com There and not there  Magdeburg is in what was called  vaguely, until fourteen years ago, East Germany. It is  well known for being an important pre-war industrial town,  for being thoroughly bombed during the war; for a very old  cathedral, and for Otto von Guericke, after whom the university  is named. This man was a scientist who is renowned for an  experiment: he joined two empty hemispheres together and  filled them with a vacuum. Then, in an odd tug-of-war, he  had teams of horses try to pull them apart. They failed. As we stepped out of the railway  station into the strong light of six oclock in the evening,  Reini made us turn around and look at the building. It was  the most magnificent structure in the area, something that  might have been erected at the end of the nineteenth century;  one could imagine it as a great terminus for horse-drawn  carriages. From it to our hotel was a mere two minutes  walk. The hotel resembled an American motel, and was just  the place for the conference visitor: well-equipped, efficient,  unlovely, and turn of the century (the twentieth, not the  nineteenth). We washed our faces and combed our hair in  a brightly-lit bathroom before emerging for our walk with  Reini. Our walks give me the illusion  of knowing Reini better than I do. His beard, his granny  glasses, his long hair, coming down to well below his collar,  suggest  and I confirmed this from a black and white picture  in his kitchen  that, although hes probably modulated  his politics, hes largely left the incarnation he found  himself in during the student radicalism of the late Sixties,  when he was at Berlins Free University, untouched.  Naturally, hes put on weight.  No sign of his residual left-wing propensities is to be  found in his beautiful Berlin flat. Only, in the course  of conversation, a professed enthusiasm for Stuart Hall  and Raymond Williams betrays not so much an allegiance to  a programme as a private romanticism. He has travelled;  he lived for years in China; he has been to India; among  the pictures in his kitchen is a postcard that shows a place  I believed Id seen before  was it Rome? Only after repeated  glances at the brown stone buildings, the lovely urban arc  of traffic around an ancient European statue, did I recognize  the Flora Fountain in Bombay Id pass every day on my way  to school.  In the black and white photo,  Reini is smoking a cigarette. I think hes given up this  habit. Like radicalism, cigarette smoking made an exit from  bourgeois European society in the Eighties. The new religion  is life; not just the pursuit of happiness, but of health.  In this regard, Reinis unfashionable paunch  a small one,  but a paunch nevertheless  proclaims, more than any political  opinion, his marginal anomalousness. I dont know what his  relationship to the contemporary world is, but I suspect  it isnt an entirely normal one; I suspect that, in spite  of his joviality, his apparent satisfaction with his routine  of work and leisure, he is secretly bemused by the fallout  of the Cold War.  I think that he belonged to a  particular sub-group in that generation of Europeans that  was defined by the Cold War in profound and contradictory  ways; that, while hed never have given up the pleasures  and freedoms of capitalist society, or doubted the veracity  of democracy, or doubted the futility of the division of  Europe into East or West, or the bane of the Iron Curtain,  the flame of some pure, Marxist nostalgia would have been  fed, without his being even fully conscious of it, by the  existence of the Soviet Union that otherwise, in the daylight  of reason, so appalled him. The fall of the Wall and the  collapse of the Soviet Union must have left him off-kilter;  ever so slightly, in comparison to his counterpart in the  East, but off-kilter nevertheless.  Thats why, may be, he likes taking  visitors for these walks; why hes such a good guide. I  wouldnt mind him as a companion in purgatory. I asked him  if he ever found it a nuisance showing people around. He  said, no, he enjoyed seeing familiar things through others  eyes. I think the walks, punctuated by jokes and gestures  of the hand, are a sort of circling round history, a pattern  of confirmation and distancing. Because they are an improvised,  rather than an actual, form of mapping, they must accrue,  rather than lose, significance with repetition.  The walk that sunlit evening too  traced a sort of circle. We started from the hotel, went  past the station, turned right at Pizza Hut  a signpost  of post-Cold War Magdeburg  passed a group of academics  whod come here for the conference on post-colonial literatures,  walked down an immense road with tramlines in the middle,  then right, into a long featureless avenue that led us to  the cathedral  dark, huge, one of Europes oldest. From  there we turned back, past another old and peculiar building,  the General Post Office, and, finally, made our way through  a path that, by some sleight of hand, returned us to our  post-modern hotel. By our second evening, our last,  my wife and I had become well-acquainted with this arc.  Nowadays, I find it takes me only a day or two to form an  emotional link with a place Im passing through. Its as  if Ive entered yet another suburb of an indefinite but  persistent metropolis Ill never escape. This suburb is  different from the one I was last in, but not wholly strange.  I begin to find my way in it; at first, like a blind man;  then, with a mixture of circumspection and trepidation,  like someone whos never strayed from the route to a particular  destination over many years, but who has never found that  route boring. All this happens in approximately a day. When  I was a child, I recall, I went to Athens, but never felt  like seeing the Parthenon. Now, I find that a city like  Magdeburg compels me to discover it.  My reading, on the second day,  was at 7 pm; we had the rest of the day to ourselves. We  visited a pharmacy; chanced upon an open market in a town  square; photographed the statue of a man on horseback; and  ran, astonishingly, into an Indian selling knick-knacks.  He told me hed been a taxi driver in Punjab; he had married  a German tourist and come here eleven years ago. They were  now divorced; hed stayed on. My discovery of this man,  my compatriot, was, to me, incredible; for Id begun to  imagine I was the only Indian man in Magdeburg. These days,  no one stares at you in the West; eye-contact is a potential  precursor to assault; when it occurs, its nearly always  domesticated by a nod and a smile. In Magdeburg, though,  my family and I were stared at intently. During that stare,  I became aware not only of my own extraordinariness, but  of the extraordinariness of history. These feelings were  complicated by a conversation I had had five minutes prior  to meeting the Indian vendor.  We were resting on a bench before  a fountain; a tramp with a can of lager in one hand sat  on the neighbouring bench. Indien? he said suddenly. Disarmed,  I nodded. He then asked me a series of questions in German.  No Deutsch, no Deutsch, I replied. He embarked upon a  hoarse, rapid monologue. Finally, he raised his arm in the  old Nazi salute. What had this man done and thought, I wondered,  during those forty-odd years of communism? Reini tells me that most East  Germans, in a fit of collective amnesia, forgot the legacy  of socialism overnight. An Indian friend says, however,  that she found an older generation in Dresden still insisting  on speaking Russian as a second language. Certainly, in  Magdeburg, it would be impossible, today, to get by without  German. And the second language in question now is not Russian,  but English; and, as the head of the English department  shrugged and sighed, These Easterners know no English.  English is the language of the  post-Cold War era. This should pose no problems of communication  between East and West Germany; but it seems a knowledge  of English, or the lack of it, has become a metaphor, in  certain circles in Germany, for a figurative barrier, a  silence that keeps, like Isherwoods shadow line, one  side from the other. Most of the teachers at Magdeburgs  English department are, indeed, Westerners, and, thus,  commuters. Just as Reinis life was an intersection in my  journey, my journey must have been an intersection in the  constant travelling of which his life is composed, the weekly  to-ing and fro-ing on the autobahn between West Berlin  and what he once laughingly called, in a moment of levity,  darkest Europe.

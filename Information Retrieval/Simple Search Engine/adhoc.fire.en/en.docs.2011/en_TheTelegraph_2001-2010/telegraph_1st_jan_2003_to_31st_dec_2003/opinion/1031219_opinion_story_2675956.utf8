 Novy Kapadia				 	 In the long run																								Nations Pride Dhanraj Pillay By K. Armugam, Field Hockey, Rs 60																								Ahockey buff though a scientist by profession, K. Armugam presents an informative biography of the most well known face of contemporary Indian hockey, the mercurial forward Dhanraj Pillay. The book is copiously illustrated and has a racy narrative. It traces the rags-to-riches tale of Indias most durable hockey star in the era of artificial surfaces. A few decades ago, when international hockey was played at a gentler pace on grass, it was possible for stars like the late inside forward, Udham Singh, and the legendary right half-back, Leslie Claudius, to play in four Olympics. However, post 1975, when it became mandatory to play international hockey on artificial surfaces, the career-spans of players have become shorter.																								Not Pillays though. Armugam follows the highs and lows of Pillays career, from his childhood till the Asia Cup win in September 2003. Born on July 15, 1966, to a poor family in Khadki in Pune, Dhanraj was the youngest child of a migrant labourer from Tamil Nadu. His father worked as a groundsman in the ordinance factory and his three older brothers all played hockey.																								In fact, it was one of the older brothers, Ramesh, who initiated Dhanraj Pillay into the game and was his first coach. It was at Rameshs insistence that Dhanraj moved to Bombay in 1988. He honed his skills playing for Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers in the Bombay Hockey Association league. The former international, Joaquim Carvalho, recognized Dhanrajs potential and coaxed him to join Mahindra. 																								He first caught the eye of the selectors in the 1989 Gwalior nationals, which Bombay won. He made his debut for the country in the Asia Cup in Delhi in December 1989. In March 1990, he played the first of his four world cups in Lahore. In the 1994 World Cup at Sydney, Pillay was at his scintillating best and was chosen as one of the 16 best players in the world.																								Armugam succeeds in showing that Pillay is Indian hockeys first true professional. He has had stints with London Gymkhana and later with professional club sides in Germany, France, Bangladesh and Malaysia. This has helped to improve his fitness and versatility. Before the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, he became a brand ambassador for Reebok. In 1998 he became captain of India for the first time. It was his finest hour. He top-scored with 11 goals in the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games. His performance and leadership enabled India to win the Asiad gold after 32 years. Since 2000 he has played more as a provider for strikers Gagan Ajit Singh and Deepak Thakur. He became the only hockey player to get both the Arjuna and Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna awards.																								Pillays popularity with the fans, his accessibility to the media and his volatile temper are not left untouched. His motivational powers as skipper and his initiative in starting hockey academies in Bombay and Bangalore are also well documented.																								Armugams crisply written book provides insight into the life and career of the man who has brought Indian hockey back into the limelight. The only grouse is that little light is thrown on his personal predilections and lifestyle.						NOVY KAPADIA

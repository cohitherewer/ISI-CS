 Ravi Vyas				 	 Key to success																								Is it possible today to work as an in-house editor without some basic knowledge and experience of computers? Specifically, without knowing the basics of Microsoft Word, that is, online reading and editing of typescripts, transmission and retrieval of copy and generally saving the copy in appropriate files and folders? The answer is a flat no. 																								And the reasons are simple: almost all manuscripts are submitted today in electronic files like floppies or CDs which the editor should know how to open and edit on the screen and save the changes in the appropriate files; almost all written correspondence with the author is conducted on e-mail and filed in the authors electronic files. Finally, after the author-editor interaction in the preparation of the final copy for the printers is over, what is handed over to them is not the traditional typed copy but a floppy or a CD, all downloadable directly onto a plate to be printed off. This cuts costs because time and money is saved for both the publisher and printer. It also keeps the author happy by cutting down the time taken to print the book and putting it on the market. 																								But the big question is: how is the young aspiring editor to acquire these skills? The pat answer would be to buy a desktop computer, get a few elementary lessons and then practice. But not many have the resources to do it. 																								The first step should be to acquire a beaten-down manual typewriter and then practise on the keyboard, beginning with the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog  the sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet. The logic is simple: the layout of the keyboard of the manual typewriter is the same as the computers.																								Though the ability to read, edit, and save changes, to send and receive messages on the computer is an essential qualification to land the first job, it is just the first step. Most editors stop at that but there are numerous other applications to be learned as you go along. For a desk editor whose primary responsibility is to check the language, style and subject matter, two other factors are equally important: information-gathering and fact-checking via the internet. Both these requirements can be accessed through the search engines, but it requires some training to be able to do so efficiently.																								Besides, editorial functions today have widened to include some basic marketing skills or production techniques, especially in the design and layout of the book. Very simply, editors are doubling up as marketing or production assistants. 																								For both functions, computers can be an invaluable tool: for marketing, information storage of mailing lists and their categorization, which can pinpoint potential areas of sales; for design and layouts, computer-aided design software can design the entire book in-house. This does not mean that editors are expected to take over the professional jobs of graphic artists or marketing executives, but they are encouraged to acquire some of the basic skills or at least be familiar with their applications in their day-to-day work.																								What young editors must realize is that publishing today is a total activity: from the acquisition of typescripts, their editing and designing, production and finally marketing and sales. Computers will take them a long way in getting these functions done in the minimum time and without much fuss.						RAVI VYAS

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, August 21, 2003 				 A CIRCUS FOR THE ASKING
 Gouri Chatterjee																								They said what theyd said before, they heckled the way they always do, they voted the way they were expected to. Yet, they made news.																								But our MPs wont be surprised. This is par for the course for the Indian press. The just concluded no-confidence debate was just the sort of show the media seem to want from politicians: a gladiatorial combat, all sound and fury signifying little but easy to report. (It would have been even better if it had not delayed papers by going into extra time.)																								So the members came to Parliament dressed better than usual, showed more decorum in the House than normal and honed their histrionic skills even more assiduously.																								The conventional wisdom that pervades newsrooms today is that politics doesnt sell. Parliament even less so. And policy discussions in Parliament, even if they are about issues that will deeply impact our lives like, say, WTO, not at all.																								And journalists are not complaining. Policy stories demand understanding of boring technical points. Thats hard work. So much easier to reduce Parliament to a big fight or a one-day match or a sort of Draupadis vastraharan  like the first no-confidence motion of the 13th Lok Sabha.																								All the reporters had to do was describe the tone and tenor for which a few adjectives like hard-hitting, sharp and attacking, aggressive, combative or verbs like slammed or lashed out were enough. Just what our elected representatives want to limit journalists to. Give them circus, theyll forget to ask questions. And the journos delude themselves they are smarter than our pols. New at fifty-six																								Barkha Dutt is unexpectedly modest. Her riveting programme with Aamir Khan amongst the soldiers in Kargil wasnt my idea, it was a corporate decision.																								It wasnt even meant for August 15 to begin with. The plan was to make a series on the army, along the lines of an old American show called Meet the Troops. It was only later that NDTV decided to sell it  to advertisers and viewers  as an Independence Day special.																								That explains a lot. How on earth could a 56th anniversary generate anything imaginative or exciting? At 56, theres nothing special to commemorate. Not for a person, not for a nation. Is it any surprise therefore that the rest of the Independence Day specials  especially in print  were such a disaster? Tired ideas like 56 events that changed India (India Today) and Surviving India (Outlook) and Freedom: a matter of choice (Times of India) are produced mechanically simply to garner advertisements.																								Of course, an Aamir Khan starrer sells itself. Especially when it builds upon the Lagaan heros patriotic cache. And this time next year Jai Jawan too may appear just as routine. NDTV has more such plans for our boys. Hell is yet to freeze																								American newspapers are in a bind. They are delighted he has entered the 135-strong fray in California, transforming a state governors election into a mega event. Yes, his is the biggest name in the contest and thats precisely the problem. His name is just too big.																								In full, Arnold Schwarzenegger adds up to 20 letters. Take only his last name and that is still 14 letters to squeeze into a headline. And hes making headlines everyday now.																								Arnold of course is shorter, Arnie has both brevity and instant recall. But they dont do that in the US. As one Washington Post editor has said, they would start referring to politicians by their first names at about the time hell freezes over. It appears too chummy, too intimate. No single columns then for the last action hero, whatever he does.																								Indian papers have no such constraints. Vajpayee is often Atal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee usually Buddha, Sonia rarely Gandhi. Our goodwill ambassador from Bihar is more in tune with the Yanks. Why do you write Laloo? he asked reporters recently. Hum tumhara dost nahina ban gaya? Going by the headlines it would appear he has.

Establish a pool of athletes for doping control based on stated criteria and priority for testing given to those athletes assessed as being at a higher risk of doping.																								Make no-advance-notice testing a priority and conduct target testing.																								Anti-doping organizations conducting testing shall maintain the integrity, identity and security and validity of samples, from notifying the athlete to transporting samples to the laboratory.																								Anti-doping organizations conducting testing shall utilize procedures for test distribution planning, notification of athletes, collection of samples and transport which comply with standards approved by the World Anti-Doping Agency.																								All doping control specimens shall immediately become the property of the anti-doping organization initiating the test. However, no specimen may be used for any purpose other than the detection of substances on the prohibited list...without the athletes written consent.																								Doping control specimens shall be analysed only in WADA-accredited laboratories or as otherwise approved by WADA in accordance with the following principles:																								Doping control samples shall be analysed to detect substances and methods identified on the prohibited list and other substances as may be directed by WADA ...																								Laboratories shall analyse doping control samples and report results in conformity with laboratory analysis and reporting standards established by WADA.																								Upon receipt of a sample adverse analytical finding, the anti-doping organization shall promptly notify the athlete, in the manner set out in its rules, of: (a) the adverse analytical finding; (b) the athletes right to promptly request the analysis of the B sample or, failing such request, that the B sample analysis will be deemed waived; and (c) the right of the athlete and/or the athletes representative to attend the B sample opening and analysis.																								Before an anti-doping organization asserts that an anti-doping rule has been violated, the following principles will be respected:																								The anti-doping organization shall give the athlete or other person subject to sanction notice, in the manner set out in its rules, of the anti-doping rule which appears to have been violated, and the basis of the violation.																								After an adverse analytical finding on the B sample, or if the B sample analysis has been waived, the athlete shall also be given, upon request, a copy of the laboratory documentation package which includes information as required by standards approved by WADA.																								After notification...the athlete or other person subject to sanction shall have the opportunity to present promptly a statement to the anti-doping organization or other reviewing body which may be established by the anti-doping organization.																								The anti-doping organization or other reviewing body established by such organization shall: (a) inquire whether an applicable therapeutic use exemption has been granted... (b) consider whether there is any irregularity in the testing process or laboratory analysis which casts substantial doubt on the adverse analytical finding; (c) consider any explanation provided by the athlete or other person subject to sanction; and (d) conduct any follow-up investigation which may be required under applicable anti-doping policies and rules adopted pursuant to the code or which the anti-doping organization otherwise considers appropriate. 																								A signatory may adopt rules, applicable to any event for which the signatory is the ruling body or for any team selection process for which the signatory is responsible, permitting provisional suspensions to be imposed after the review.

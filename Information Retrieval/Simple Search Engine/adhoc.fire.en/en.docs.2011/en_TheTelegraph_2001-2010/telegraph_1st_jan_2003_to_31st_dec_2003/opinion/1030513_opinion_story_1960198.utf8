		 Tuesday, May 13, 2003  THE SINS OF FISSION
 - Remembering Rajajis sustained campaign against nuclear  weapons  RAMACHANDRA GUHA ramguhavsnl.com Mahatma Gandhi once remarked that  the atom bomb was the greatest sin known to science. After  India exploded a nuclear device on May 11, 1998, and the  nation swirled around itself in hysteria, it took a contemporary  Gandhian to remember what the master had said. Thus, the  first dissenting article in the national press was written  by the veteran architect, Laurie Baker, who recalled the  three tests an invention of science had to pass in a country  such as ours. These tests were: Is it non-violent? Is it  eco-friendly? Is it poverty-reducing? The answers, in the  case at hand, were No, No, and No. Now, five years after the Pokhran  blasts, let us recall the Gandhian who, in his lifetime,  mounted the most sustained campaign against nuclear weapons.  He was C. Rajagopalachari. In 1945, after the bombs were  dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he quipped, All this  while we knew only of the chemists bombs. Now we know of  bombs made by physicists. A decade later, his tone was  deadly serious. His biographer, Rajmohan Gandhi, quotes  from a letter written by Rajaji to the The New  York Times at the end of 1954, in which he urged each  party in the Cold War not to wait for the other, but to  unilaterally throw all the atomic bombs in the deep Antarctic  and begin a new world free from fear. In 1959, in a piece directed against  nuclear tests, Rajaji wrote in disgust of politicians and  technicians who do not believe in co-existence and mutual  trust, but are convinced, and have been doing their best  to educate the people to believe, that the best defence  of national existence is to make it clear that they have  terrible weapons of retaliation. And this is naturally associated  with a policy of armament manufacture to achieve that retaliatory  stren- gth and purpose. He was speaking, of course, of  America and Russia, then, but he could as well be speaking  of India and Pakistan, now. Rajaji thought that the making  of atom bombs was the product of hubris, with modern man  believing he had the rights and privileges of the sun or  even of the Lord God himself. It was, he remarked, an  unfortunate day when science lifted the curtain of fundamental  matter and trespassed into the greenroom of creation. Rajaji  made a distinction between a free science which honestly  documented the radiation effects of nuclear tests, and a  hired science which tried to doctor its results. Atomic  tests, he said, were a wholly illegitimate attack on the  health of the present and future generations of the uninvolved  millions, who have not yet written off their rights in favour  of the nuclear pugilists. Rajajis campaign against nuclear  arms culminated in a journey he made to the United Kingdom  and the United States of America in 1962, at the head of  a three-member delegation travelling under the auspices  of the Gandhi Peace Foundation. (The other members were  R.R. Diwakar and B. Shiva Rao.) Rajaji was already 83, and  this, believe it or not, was his first trip to the West.  In America he met, among others, Henry Kissinger, Robert  Oppenheimer (the man who had led the Los Alamos team that  made the atom bomb, but had later thrown his hat into the  peace camp), and the representatives to the United Nations  of the Soviet Union and the US. Rajaji also spoke at several  universities and at the prestigious Council for Foreign  Relations in New York. All through, he pursued his case  against the Bomb with (to quote his biographer) the energy  of a 40-year-old. The highlight of the trip was  a meeting with John F. Kennedy, who gave them 25 minutes,  but was so charmed by Rajaji that in the end they chatted  for over an hour. Later, Kennedy told an aide that seldom  have I heard a case presented with such precision, clarity  and elegance of language. The diplomat, B.K. Nehru, who  was present, recalled how the secretaries who came in with  slips of paper reminding the president of his appointments  were shooed away. Kennedy, it appears, was fascinated  by Rajaji. But Rajaji wasnt entirely sure  that the president was convinced. A week later, the journalist,  Vincent Shean, met him in New York, and sought to gift him  a stamp of Mahatma Gandhi just issued by the US postal department.  You keep it, said Rajaji to Shean, and use it in a letter  to Kennedy asking for the renunciation of the atomic bomb. After the delegations return  to India, B. Shiva Rao wrote to Jawaharlal Nehru of the  impact its leader had made. When Rajaji spoke at the council  of foreign relations, the leader of the American delegation  to the UN disarmament conference in Geneva told Shiva Rao:  Why dont you send this man to represent India at Geneva?  Altogether, Rajaji had made a deep impression on all the  persons he saw in the USA and England. He would, Shiva  Rao told the prime minister, make an admirable representative  for Indiain Geneva. He was extremely able and dignified  in his presentation of the case for nuclear disarmament.  Were he indeed to be sent as the governments representative  to the talks, it would aid India in playing a constructive  part in bringing about phased disarmament. The suggestion was well meant,  and well merited. But by this time, Nehru and Rajaji were  in rival political parties. True, they agreed on the Bomb,  but the prime minister found the older mans attacks on  his economic and social policies hard to forgive. Rajaji  is undoubtedly a person of high ability, replied Nehru  to Shiva Rao, and we all have respect and affection for  him. But I doubt very much if he will at all suit or fit  in with the disarmament conference at Geneva which consists  of senior officials. Also, unfortunately, he disagrees with  almost everything in the domestic or international sphere  for which some of us stand. Partisan considerations would  not allow India to send its best man to Geneva. Strikingly, Rajaji was against  atomic power as well as atomic weapons. When, in 1954, The  Times of India insisted that nuclear energy was vital  to a power-starved India, Rajaji drew their attention  to the terrible character of the risks necessarily attached  to this industry. Its process of production totally disregards  the rights of those that do not in any way benefit from  the enterprises. Moreover, the general public is almost  entirely ignorant of all that the new power source involves.  It is not like coal or oil but comparable to a hypothetical  case of using the thunderbolt to cook our breakfast. This  was characteristically acute, as well as prescient, for  it took another two or three decades before science, and  society, made a proper acquaintance with the risks and costs  of nuclear power. The anti-nuclear movement in India  has witnessed the not always comfortable co-existence of  Gandhians and Communists. However, after 1998, it has been  more or less captured by the left who, on the one hand,  do not question the dangers of nuclear energy and, on the  other, seem to think that nuclear weapons are somehow safe  if placed in the hands of red regimes. Thus the Communist  Party of India (Marxist), which has been so forthright in  its criticisms of Indias nuclear programme, was silent  for years about Chinas possession of atomic weapons.  Rajajis work has a more general  relevance to questions of scientific ethics and nationalist  military rivalry, but it also has a more specific relevance,  to the ethics of the anti-nuclear movement itself. He once  expressed his wish to rescue the peace movement from the  clutches of the Communist party. It is a task that remains  unfinished.

 - Why Indian intellectuals and activists are hostile to the  market  POLITICS AND PLAY / RAMACHANDRA  GUHA ramguhavsnl.com  Nehru and Krishna  Menon  Back in the Sixties, it used to  be said that Indias most successful export were economists.  Our economy was resolutely insulated from the rest of the  world, but our economists occupied high posts in famous  universities in Europe and America. Later, the joke was  amended to say that the reason Indias economy was mediocre  was because its economists were world-class. No South Korean  was a professor of political economy at Cambridge; no Malaysian  had been awarded the Nobel Prize. But their economies grew  at an impressive 8 per cent, whereas ours stayed stuck at  3.5 per cent, also known as the Hindu rate of growth. My own theory about Indian economists  is more specific and hopefully less facetious. It runs as  follows; Gujarati economists place faith in the market,  while Bengali economists are prone to trust the state. In  the Fifties, when P.C. Mahalonobis drafted the Soviet-inspired  second five year plan, A.D. Shroff responded by starting  the Forum of Free Enterprise. In the Sixties and the Seventies,  about the only economist of pedigree advocating Indian integration  with the world economy was the Gujarati, Jagdish Bhagwati.  He was opposed by an arrazy of Marxists, many of whom (naturally)  were Bengali. It is tempting to see the victory  of the Bengalis here as historic retribution, a revenge  in the realm of economics for what had been taken away from  them in the realm of politics. Mahatma Gandhi had put paid  to Subhas Chandra Bose, but Mahalanobis would vanquish A.D.  Shroff and his ilk. In truth, they won because their ideas  were very widely shared. In the Fifties, there was much  suspicion about the market, and much romantic enchantment  about the state. At this time, the Soviet economy was believed  to be rapidly catching up with Americas. And when Sputnik  was launched and Yuri Gagarin went into space, the Russians  seemed light-years ahead of their nearest rivals. State intervention was thought  back then to increase production, aid innovation and facilitate  redistribution. The market, according to its critics, would  only make the rich richer. Fortunately for them, the state-oriented  economists found a great champion in Indias first prime  minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru was a democrat who had  little sympathy with the political system of the Soviet  Union. But he was deeply attracted by its economic model.  Like his Fabian mentors in Britain, he thought that by mixing  elections and planning he would get the best of both worlds. Nehru was convinced of the need  for the public sector to occupy the commanding heights  of the economy. Crucially in his case, theoretical preference  was confirmed by aesthetic choice. For Nehru had a disdain  for business, and businessmen. Money-making was an activity  meant for the crafty and corrupt. His upbringing was reinforced  by his education in Harrow and Cambridge, for like a Brahmin,  an English gentleman also kept his distance from tradesmen. On his first trip to the United  States of America, in October 1949, Nehru was thrown a lavish  party by the mayor of New York. In his welcome speech the  mayor crooned, Mr Neeroo, the men around this table are  worth fifty billion dollars. It was not a remark calculated  to impress the distinguished visitor. From that early experience,  Nehru came to firmly associate the US with the vulgarity  of commerce. If the business of America was business, it  was best if India and Indians maintained a safe distance  from it. Nehru was prime minister for 17  years; his daughter, for 11. Indira Gandhi shared her fathers  dislike of business. There was one difference, however.  She was always happy to see businessmen, so long as they  grovelled before her, and then contributed to the party  coffers. (Alas, many were ready to do both.) But in her  economic policies, she was, if anything, even more hostile  to the market. For the Sixties was when India should have  liberalized on both the domestic and international fronts.  Twenty years of independent development had given us a decent  industrial and technological base. Now was the time to expose  our businessmen to a dose of competition, to nudge them  away from protection and favouritism. But instead, Mrs Gandhi  further strengthened the public sector. In this, she was  influenced by her left-wing advisers, and by the fact that  to command a majority in Parliament she needed the support  of the Communist Party of India. But an additional factor  were her own reservations about trade and commerce. Like  her father, she thought that, all things considered, the  state would do a better job than the market. It took another 30 years for the  market to be viewed with more sympathy by the rulers of  India. In 1991, a foreign exchange crisis compelled the  government of the day to adopt policies of economic liberalization.  Directing the process were two practical Punjabis: Manmohan  Singh, who was finance minister; and Montek Singh Ahluwalia,  who was finance secretary. Another crucial player at the  policy level was the chief economic adviser, who, as it  happens, was Gujarati, Ashok Desai. A decade of liberalization has  resulted in manifest gains. Indias software boom, for example,  would not have been possible without the policy about-turn  of the early Nineties. Yet liberalization has met with great  opposition. Among its fiercest critics are insecure businessmen  (who fear competition) and power-hungry politicians (who  fear losing control). These vested interests have found  an unlikely ally: the Indian intellectual. In India, at least, many economists  remain unconvinced about the virtues of the market. And  their reservations are shared by the overwhelming majority  of sociologists, historians and political scientists. Say  the word market, and in a Pavlovian reflex they will answer:  Unjust and exploitative. Behind this lie the prejudices  of caste and class. Indian social scientists are, almost  to the last man, of Brahminical, or at least suvarna,  origin. And their conditions of work are far removed from  the production process. They do not have to go about the  messy business of entering the market-place; instead, they  are subsidized by the state. However, in seeking to protect  the interests of the workers against the capitalist, Indian  intellectuals overlook the interests of a more numerous  class still: the consumers, who welcome competition as leading  to better and cheaper products. And in focusing on the question  of equity, the intellectuals altogether overlook the question  of productivity. One must first increase the size of the  cake before one can begin distributing it. And here the  market is a more handy ally than the state: for it produces  goods faster, and in greater quantities. The market does have its imperfections.  One is that left to itself, it tends to pollute and degrade  the environment. A second is that employers generally do  not pay attention to the health and safety of the worker.  A third is that without consumer vigilance and action, industrialists  do not always deliver on quality. A fourth is that the market  disregards those without purchasing power. A fifth is that  one cannot rely on the market to deliver on goods and services  whose value cannot be reduced to monetary terms, such as  primary education and basic healthcare. To correct and improve the functioning  of the market, civil society groups have a vital role. So  does the state. It must educate its citizens, all of them,  and keep them healthy. Also crucial to market efficiency  is transparency of governance. Liberalization will not work  if laws are not enforced and politicians (or officials)  can be bought and sold. Hostility to the market is ubiquitous  among intellectuals and activists. Hearing them declaim  self-righteously against liberalization and globalization,  I wonder which economic system they would put in its stead?  That of the Soviet Union? Or our own licence-permit-quota  raj? Yes, much needs to be done to make the market  more efficient, transparent and participatory. But in producing  most goods that humans live by, it by far out-performs the  state. To believe otherwise is an intellectual superstition,  on par with Murli Manohar Joshis faith in the efficacy  of astrology.

 THIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT  SINGH				 	 Preachings practised																								The biblical injunction to love ones neighbour is more honoured in breach than in observance. All over the world, peoples first hate are their neighbours on either side. In villages and towns they fight with them, take them to court and do their best to eliminate them. Most wars were, and are today, fought between neighbouring countries. Take our own case. Who do we distrust most? Pakistan. We have fought three wars against it and are ever preparing for the fourth. Next to Pakistan, we distrust Bangladesh. Being much stronger, we dont fear Bangladesh but have constant tension on our borders with them. 																								The one exception to the general rule of distrusting neighbours are writers and poets of the countries. Despite the atmosphere of hate that has pervaded since we became independent countries, the one small community which refused to submit to it are our men and women of letters. Pakistan had its Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Qateel Shifai. It has Ahmed Faraz today. We had Ali Sardar Jafri and Kaifi Azmi and a host of Hindi and Punjabi writers: Bhisham Sahni, Amrita Pritam and nameless others. Bangladesh has Tasleema Nasreen. 																								The spirit that animated these creative writers and poets was aptly summarized in his lines by Chiragh Deen Ustad Daman of Lahore written on the partition of the country: Akhi yaan di lalee paee dasdi  ay Tusee roey ho; Roey aseen vee haan																								(The redness in your eyes shows/ You have been crying/ we too have cried with you.)																								Fortunately, such men and women exist and continue to raise their voices against the destructive power of hatred. The latest example is poet Feza Aazmi of Karachi. He is a Mohajir, a refugee from Uttar Pradesh, now a Pakistani. His latest masnavi (epic poem) is Azaab Hamsayagi. The Agony Trail deals with the ups and downs of Indo-Pak relations. It opens with a prayer:																								Namaaz-e-Ishq parth lein/ Our buton par guft-gu-kar lein.																								I give a rough translation into English of the poem because his own does not do justice to the original:																								It conveys the sentiment behind the composition:																								Prayer of love we offer to you																								With your idols we will hold 																								converse;																								We will prostrate ourselves																								where we like 																								Hymns of love we will chant 																								everywhere																								How long will we remain torn 																								apart?																								Let us sew some pieces 																								together for a start																								Far too long has the tavern 																								been deserted																								Let us fill our goblets with fresh wine																								We know your heart still bears scars																								So do our hearts; but with every breath																								It is up to us to heal them or bleed to 																								death																								We will grasp your hand of friendship 																								when you extend it																								We will take up arms and fight to our 																								last breath																								We are willing to be your friends as we 																								are to be your foes																								Will grasp your hand of friendship as 																								the saying goes																								If it is war you want we will be ready to 																								fight																								If it is love you offer well take it with 																								delight. Last offering																								Many years ago, I happened to be in Calgary (Canada) on the invitation of the local Sikh community. I was invited to address the congregation in the gurdwara following the morning service. I noticed a most attractive young woman who sat facing the ragis. Her eyes were shut; she seemed transported to another world. She was bewitching.																								Since I was collecting data on the Sikh diaspora, I thought I would tell the Calgary Sikhs how their brethren were doing in other parts of the world. But a few young men interrupted me and angrily asked me why I was opposed to Khalistan. I let loose on them all the eloquence in my command and told them how Khalistan would spell disaster for the Sikhs and the country. There was quite a hungama. Then the lady stood up and silenced the rowdies. She was Rani Balbir Kaur of Chandigarh who had brought her troupe of artists to enact dramas for Punjabi audiences in Canada and the United States.																								Rani Balbir comes from a prosperous family. She lives in a large house in Chandigarh and owns another in New Delhi. Having been separated from her husband (now dead), she was the subject of a lot of malicious gossip which over-shadowed her undoubted achievements as a professor of drama, film-maker and producer of plays. She had a stout champion in Maya Ray, wife of then governor, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, and was often invited to the Punjab Raj Bhavan. After 35 years of teaching and lots of awards from the government and private organizations, she is due to retire in a few months time. Her last offering is a musical and dramatic rendering of the life of the late poet Kaifi Azmi. He had written verses for her; she had enormous admiration for him. He was an admirable men by any reckoning. In keeping with his communist beliefs, he gave away his ancestral land to tillers who ploughed it. When in Delhi, he lived in a single room in the partys headquarters. Though later stricken with partial paralysis, he continued to travel to towns and villages to spread his message of the need to set right inequality and injustice:																								Labalab hain kahin sagar/ Kahin khali pyale hain/ Yeh kaisa daur hai Saki?/ Yeh kya takseem hai Saki?																								(In some places the seas overflow/ At others goblets have not a drop of wine/ O Saki what times are these/ What kind of justice is this?)																								Being a Marxist non-believer, Kaifi extolled the power of wine: Unko Khuda miley hai Khuda  ki jineh  talaash Mujhko bas ek jhalak meyrey  dildaar ki  miley																								(Let them find God who seek God/ All I want is a glimpse of the one I love.)																								Rani Balbirs role-model of a dramatist is the German communist playwright, Bertolt Brecht (1898-1936), whose Three Penny Opera earned worldwide acclaim. Her dramatized operatic version of Kaifi Azmis life will be eagerly awaited by theatre lovers. The right feeling																								Patient: Doctor sahib, I get vertigo. While walking I feel like Im drunk.																								Doctor: Do you drink alcohol?																								Patient: No, sir.																								Doctor: You are lucky then. I spend Rs 150 to Rs 200 daily to get this feeling and you are getting it free of cost.																								(Contributed by Rajnish, 																								Shimla)

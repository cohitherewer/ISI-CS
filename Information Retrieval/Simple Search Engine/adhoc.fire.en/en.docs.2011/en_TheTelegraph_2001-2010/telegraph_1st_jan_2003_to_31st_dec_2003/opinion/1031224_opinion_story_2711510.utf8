																								By deciding to launch the offensive against rebels from Indias North-east, Bhutan has set a Himalayan example in mature diplomacy. The kingdoms decision has greater diplomatic and security import than the military campaign would immediately suggest. Irrespective of the success of the campaign, it goes a long way in holding up certain basic principles of statecraft. One of these prescribes that rebels from other shores can be a threat to a countrys own security. However, if Thimphu had delayed its action against the rebels, that was not because it lacked the will to drive them out of its territory, but because it wanted to give peace a chance. For a small country with no experience of war in its modern history, it cannot have been easy for Bhutan to finally decide on the offensive. It is not just a question of the small size of its army or of its lack of logistics for fighting guerrilla groups in thick, mountainous jungles. King Jigme Singye Wangchuk had negotiated with the militant groups for more than four years, hoping to persuade them to shift their camps out of the countrys borders. The Buddhist kingdom did not lose its patience even if the militants repeatedly went back on their promises to wind up the camps and leave its territory. The fact that Bhutan took its neighbours into confidence about the impending offensive also points to a diplomatic appreciation of regional cooperation.																								Thimphus action must have been prompted by the impact on its relations with India. It would be simplistic, however, to suggest that Bhutan finally decided to act at Indias behest. The issue of the militants presence in the forests of Bhutan had been a major concern for India for many years. If Bhutan had to act under pressure from New Delhi, it would have done so much earlier. India, too, realized that the situation in Bhutan was very different from the one in Bangladesh, where militants from the North-east camped with covert support from sections of Dhakas security and political establishment. Unlike the Bangladesh case, Bhutan was itself a victim of the militant menace, which destabilized life and threatened peace in southern Bhutan. More important, by persistently refusing to heed Thimphus requests to leave the land, the rebels challenged the authority of the monarch and his government. It is logical to assume that the promise of moral and logistical support from New Delhi influenced the Bhutanese decision. Bhutans action would be seen in both capitals as a turning point in bilateral ties, as a grateful deputy prime minister, Mr L.K. Advani, suggested. But the campaign ultimately remains a measure of Thimphus diplomatic initiatives.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 FOR ITS OWN GOOD
																								Only a failed state allows its territory to be used by mercenaries from other lands. Bangladesh may not be a failed state in the sense that many banana republics have been. But its refusal to even look into the complaint about the presence of rebels from Indias North-east has a disturbing tone typical of the unreasonableness of failed states. Bhutans successful offensive against such rebel camps on its soil has once again brought into focus Dhakas strange posturings. Let alone India, even important sections of political and diplomatic circles in Bangladesh are unimpressed with their governments rhetoric. And there are stark realities staring in the face for anyone who cares to see them. That the north-eastern rebels use Bangladesh as a passage for arms shipment, or for their training camps and shelters, has long been an open secret. Arrests of some rebel leaders inside Bangladesh have made a mockery of Dhakas denials. Many of those arrested in India have given away details of their activities in Bangladesh. The previous regime of Sheikh Hasina Wajed saw no reason not to admit to the reality and took steps to force the rebels out of the country. If the present government of Begum Khaleda Zia sees things differently, it is mainly because of a curious mindset of a section of the political class and the army there.																								This section in Dhaka believes in the dated thesis that a neighbours insurgents can be used as a tool in diplomacy. It is unrealistic of Dhaka to expect that it can use the north-eastern rebels to score diplomatic points with India. Any country will reject this approach as unabashed blackmail. No country can barter its security for trade or any other issue. Bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh cannot improve if Dhaka refuses to respond to New Delhis security concerns. Bangladeshs standing in the international community, already under a cloud because of the activities of Islamic fundamentalist groups, will also suffer if its regime is suspected of conniving at elements engaged in subverting a neighbours peace and security. Dhaka should have been anxious to dismantle the rebel camps for yet another reason. India has repeatedly alleged that the United Liberation Front of Asom or the militant outfits from Tripura receive money and arms from Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence. The presence of these groups in Bangladesh, therefore, exposes it to the charge of helping the ISIs destabilization games in India. It is time Dhaka learnt its lesson from Thimphus pragmatism  for its own good and for regional security. Ms Zia may have much more to gain from earning Indias confidence than she could hope to by deluding herself with a bad strategy.

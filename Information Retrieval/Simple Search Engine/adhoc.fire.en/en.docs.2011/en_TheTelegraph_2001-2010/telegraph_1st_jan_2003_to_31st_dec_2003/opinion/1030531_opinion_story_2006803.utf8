		 Saturday, May 31, 2003  THE UN AND OCCUPIED IRAQ
 - The lessons of the Iraq war and its aftermath deserve study  in India  CHANDRASHEKHAR DASGUPTA The author is former ambassador to  the European Union and China Faces of authority  The resolution on Iraq adopted  without opposition by the security council on May 22 opens  a new chapter in the history of the United Nations. For  the first time since its inception, the security council  has conferred a mandate on an occupying power to administer  the territory of one of its member states. In an earlier  period, the UN, through its trusteeship council, had played  a notable role in promoting the transition of non-self governing  territories to independent statehood. The security council  has now conferred legitimacy on the reversion of a UN member  from independent statehood to the status of a non-self governing  territory, albeit for a temporary period. History has shifted  to reverse gear, as it were. The New York Times  quotes an Arab ambassador as commenting: It is a trusteeship,  a full, complete trusteeship. In the 21st century that is  a sensitive issue for everybody. This description is at  once correct and incorrect. It correctly draws a parallel  between occupied Iraq and the Trust Territories or League  of Nations mandates of an earlier era. It errs in failing  to note that the United Nations charter specifically forbids  the imposition of trusteeship on any of its members. Article  78 states: The Trusteeship system shall not apply to territories  which have become members of the United Nations, relations  among which shall be based on respect for the principle  of sovereign equality. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the former  secretary-general of the UN, laments in his memoirs that  the United States sees little need for diplomacy; power  is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacyThe Roman Empire  had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the United States. Diplomacy  is perceived by an imperial power as a waste of time and  prestige and a sign of weakness. The comment fails to do  full justice to the United States of America  and to the  role of diplomacy. Powerful states are, indeed, prone to  take recourse to arms in pursuing their national interests  but they must turn to diplomacy in order to obtain legal  and moral cover. That is precisely what the US has done  in the case of Iraq. Washington decided to launch military  operations against the Iraqi regime without a mandate from  the security council because it was not prepared to accept  the conditions demanded by France, with support from Russia  and Germany. This situation resulted from major miscalculations  on the part of France as well as the US. Paris failed to  anticipate the price it might have to pay for opposing the  American initiative. Washington failed to anticipate the  extent of French demands and the support these would attract  from other countries. Washington later made it clear  that its opponents, in particular France, would have to  face the consequences of the stand taken by them in the  security council. Realizing that they had exceeded their  limits, the target countries rushed to make amends. The  president of France, Jacques Chirac, wished swift success  to the American operations in Iraq. The president of Russia,  Vladimir Putin, said that for economic and political reasons  he wanted a decisive American victory. The German foreign  minister, Joschke Fischer, announced that his government  hoped for the rapid collapse of the Iraqi army. These pious hopes were soon fulfilled  by the US-led forces in Iraq. Having achieved its military  objectives, Washington saw advantage in returning the Iraq  question to the security council. It had two major objectives.  First, it sought post facto legitimization of its  position in Iraq as an occupying power. Second, it wanted  the security council to terminate the economic embargo against  Iraq so as to clear the way for exporting Iraqi oil and  repairing the countrys economy at minimum cost to the US  treasury. Anxious to mend fences with the US, France and  its associates were now prepared to adopt a cooperative  position in the security council. The US had only to make  modest concessions to secure the passage of the recent security  council resolution. The resolution adopted on May  22 recognizes the role of the US and Britain as occupying  powers constituting the Authority in Iraq. This Authority  is to administer Iraq and implement a process leading to  an internationally recognized, representative government  of Iraq. No time-frame is laid down for the transfer of  power from the Authority to the internationally recognized  Iraqi government. The resolution welcomes the willingness  of member states to contribute to stability and security  in Iraq by contributing personnel, equipment, and other  resources under the Authority. In other words, it encourages  other countries to extend material support and cooperation  to the Anglo-US occupying Authority in Iraq. The UN is given a modest and vaguely  defined role in occupied Iraq. A special representative  appointed by the UN secretary general is to work in coordination  with the Authority to assist the people of Iraq. This would  include working intensively with the Authority, the people  of Iraq, and others concerned to facilitate the process  leading to the formation of a representative government.  It is clear that the UN special representative will play  at most a supporting role in the process. It is no secret  that it was at Washingtons suggestion that the secretary  general appointed the Brazilian, Vieira de Mello, as his  special representative. The resolution lifts the economic  embargo imposed on Iraq after the 1990 Kuwait war. Under  previous resolutions, the embargo was to be lifted only  after UN arms inspectors had certified that Iraq was free  of weapons of mass destruction, but France and its associates  prudently refrained from pressing this point, in view of  American reluctance to prolong the mandates of the UN inspectors.  The latest resolution merely refers to the intention of  the security council to revisit  that is, to re-examine   these mandates. The fact is that the US has taken over  the role of the UN inspectors in the embarrassing absence  of any convincing evidence of the existence of nuclear,  chemical or biological weapons in Iraq. Iraqi oil revenues will go into  a development fund established and operated by the occupying  Authority. These will be used to meet humanitarian and reconstruction  needs as well as the costs of running an Iraqi civilian  administration. The UN secretary-general will continue to  operate the Oil-for Food programme for another six months,  after which his responsibilities will be taken over by the  occupying Authority. The six-month provision will enable  the UN to pay for goods already imported under the programme  from other countries such as Russia, Syria and India. The debates in the Indian parliament  before and during the Iraq war reflected a singular concern  with international law and morality. Not a single speaker  referred to the primacy of power in international relations  or to the ability of powerful states to redefine international  law to suit their interests. The lessons of the Iraq war  and the recent security council resolution deserve careful  study in our country.

 - Who will benefit from a more democratic WTO?  Kalyan Sanyal The author is professor of economics,  University of Calcutta Voice of resistance  Invariably, whenever an important  issue arises, experts and analysts immediately take their  clear and well-defined stands, and then confidently pontificate.  I have always envied the courage of these wise men and women  because I have discovered to my dismay that I am only good  at being puzzled. After the ministerial meeting of the World  Trade Organization at Cancun fell through, thousands of  words appeared in the media, print and television, explaining  its causes, consequences and implications  by experts of  all persuasions, both proponents and detractors of globalization.  But I must admit that I was, and still am, bewildered by  the Cancun episode. This rather belated piece is animated  by a genuine urge to share with others my sense of puzzlement.  I was only waiting for the cacophony to go down. What exactly happened at Cancun?  An alliance of developing countries, G-21, in which India  figures prominently with Brazil and China, stymied attempts  by the United States of America and the European Union to  dictate terms on the issue of farm subsidy. The latter apparently  are not ready to withdraw the huge subsidy they provide  to their farm sector that effectively denies developing  countries farmers access to the North American and European  markets. The G-21 has stubbornly refused to negotiate on  any other issue, such as the ones related to investment  and competition, until the question of farm subsidy is settled  to its satisfaction. A deep chasm seems to have appeared  within the WTO, separating the so-called North and South. No, I do not want to dwell on  the economics of farm subsidy. Even an average newspaper  reader without any formal training in economics already  knows how a farm subsidy works and what its implications  are, thanks to the discussions by experts in the media.  There is little left to add. For a change, let me make an observation  about the political reaction that the Cancun conference  has produced, an observation I find most intriguing: the  reaction of the organized left in India. It is not surprising  to see the Bharatiya Janata Party government flaunting Cancun  as a successful attempt by India to protect its national  interest in a world forum against the predatory economic  policies of powerful Western nations. But what baffles me  is that the Indian left seems to share the same sense of  triumph, interpreting Cancun as a victory of the South against  the imperialist North. For the last ten years, the left  has been vehemently criticizing the economic policies adopted  by the Indian government, policies that are driven by the  neo-liberal ideology of capitalist globalization. Then how  does one explain the fact that the Indian govern- ment and  the organized left, the two poles of the Indian political  spectrum, are both celebrating Cancun as a victory? Consider a counter-factual situation  in which the EU and the US yield to the pressure exerted  by the G-21 and agree to withdraw farm subsidies, and the  developing countries are allowed to penetrate the European  and American market for farm products. Who is likely to  benefit from such an arrangement? Not the small farmer I  suppose. In order to reap the benefits of an open foreign  market, one must have access to information, infrastructure  facilities and credit. Only the large farmers have such  access, and they are the ones who stand to gain, although  the rhetoric of the G-21 is projecting the archetypal poor  peasant of the third world as the victim of the rich nations  subsidy policy. What is puzzling is that the sectional interest  of a small minority of the population is being projected  as the national interest, and political parties of all  ideological hues are apparently endorsing it.  What seems to bring these disparate  and diverse ideological positions together on the Cancun  issue is the common allegation that the structure and modalities  of the WTO are undemocratic, where the rich nations of the  North wield disproportionate power and dictate terms. The  G-21 is being seen as a countervailing force of the South  that is working in the direction of making the WTO more  democratic and a supranational global institution in the  true sense. And it is an emphatic step toward a democratic,  albeit capitalist, globalization. (Such stars of the American  academia as Richard Falk and Joe Stiglitz are enthusiastically  peddling this idea of democratic capitalist globalization.) There is little doubt that the  distribution of power among the members of the WTO is highly  unequal, and the stubborn refusal of the US and the EU to  cut back on subsidy is symptomatic of that inequality. A  more democratic WTO, one would agree, is desirable rather  than a less democratic one. But even if the G-21 succeeds  in democratizing the WTO, the inescapable question to be  confronted is: whose democracy? Is it democracy for the  people of the South? The members of the WTO are Southern  states, and unless one assumes that democratic power enjoyed  by those states automatically translates into the same kind  of power for their subjects, why should the Southern people,  and the political parties representing their interests,  uncritically celebrate the crusade unleashed by the G-21? Even the most avid advocate of  market economy will admit that the neo-liberal policies  adopted by the Indian government, rational they may be from  the efficiency angle, are making the distribution of income  and assets increasingly unequal. As a result of these policies,  a large section of the population is suffering from dispossession  and loss of livelihood. These people are being priced out  of the markets for education and healthcare with the privatization  of these basics; the economic conditions of their existence  are increasingly being subverted by the radical shift in  the policy regime. Equal distribution of political power  alone does not make a society democratic; the real substance  of democracy derives from an egalitarian distribution of  economic power as well.  In the ultimate analysis, formal  equality in the domain of politics means nothing unless  there is equality in the economic sphere. Seen thus, the  jettisoning of the welfarist role by the Southern states  and the consequent economic disempowerment of the Southern  people signal a shift away from democracy. Why then should  these disempowered people of the South care if the Southern  states succeed in asserting their democratic power within  the WTO? The Indian left is up in arms  against the Indian state and its neo-liberal policies, but  in the international context, it seems to find it politically  correct to stand by the state in the battle against the  Western imperialists. There is a dichotomy between oppositional  politics on the domestic and international front. This is  the legacy of the political imaginary, embraced and nurtured  by the left in the years following formal decolonization,  an imaginary that had at its centre an absolutely statist  North-South divide. Is this imaginary still relevant, in  the era of globalization? Isnt the borderline between the  external and the internal spheres of contestation increasingly  becoming blurred in the age of footloose capital, commodities  and images, calling for one integrated, radical, oppositional  politics? During the conference, the Bengali  daily of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) carried  a long report on the battle of Cancun. There were pictures  of anti-globalization activists protesting outside the building  where the conference was being held, including the one in  which the Korean farmer was stabbing himself. The accompanying  analysis highlighted how a resolute G-21 and myriad other  organizations were contesting together the imperialist design.  I find the analysis very strange because I think there is  a fundamental difference between those who were squatting  outside the auditorium and the G-21 statesmen delivering  angry speeches inside.  The squatters were representing  a non-statist, grass-roots level opposition to the devastations  wreaked by capitalist globalization, while representatives  of states were engaged in a battle over the distribution  of power between themselves within the WTO. The former were  battling for a kind of radical democracy for the global  multitude while the latter were concerned solely with democracy  among the states, no matter how undemocratic and coercive  those states are toward their subjects. And any attempt  to conflate the two, for me, betrays a confused political  understanding of the current juncture. Bosses have their own conflicts  and contradictions; they have their differences; there is  a big one, and a not-so big one, a green one and a yellow  one, but they are bosses all the same. A smooth-talking  Arun Jaitley may have put up a splendid show against the  big bullies, but why are the left expending their political  energy by earnestly taking sides in this squabble among  the bosses? I dont know why. Hence my sense  of puzzlement.

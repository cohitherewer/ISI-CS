		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 CHINESE MIRAGE
																								It is typical of political rebels to lose a sense of reality. They create such a make-believe world of their own that they cannot make sense of the world around them. Something similar seems to have happened to the leaders of the United Liberation Front of Asom. The Bhutanese offensive has forced the rebels to lose their way in the jungles of southern Bhutan. The vigil by the Indian army and police on the India-Bhutan border has stopped them on their tracks to other destinations. But the ULFA leaders appeal to China to allow them to cross into Chinese territory for new shelters there betrays an amazing lack of understanding of the reality. These leaders are clearly caught in a time warp. They still live in a time when Chinese communists believed in transporting the revolution from country to country or in rehearsing rebels from other lands. It is true that China offered training or sanctuaries to rebels from Indias North-east some thirty years ago. The early rebels from Nagaland or Mizoram received Chinese help, if not for the same ideological reason which endeared the Naxalites from West Bengal to Beijing in the Sixties. The Chinese strategy of those days was also a result of its strained relations with India. Beijing has long ceased to believe in both the socialist revolution or its transportation to other parts of the world and in the policy of using rebel groups to bait and bleed India. 																								It is difficult to believe that the ULFA leaders are not aware of these changes. Their appeal to China is, therefore, to be seen as a sign of their desperation. This is evident also in the fact that the appeal is made to the non-existent chairman of the Peoples Republic of China. The country has a president in Mr Hu Jintao but no chairman. Even the Communist Party of China has never had a chairman since Mao Zedong. The mistake heightens the absurdity not only of the ULFAs appeal but also of its understanding of the world around it. Obviously, neither China nor India is expected to take any serious note of the appeal, let alone respond to it. But the Assamese people, in whose name the militant group carries on its hopeless rebellion, need to take note of it. The appeal once again shows up the ULFA for whatever it is worth and its absurd ways. The Assamese have one more evidence of how completely divorced the militants are from reality. It would be good for Assam if the rebels, on the run from Bhutans jungles, return to Assam instead of chasing the Chinese mirage. It is time these rebels without a cause returned to peace and the world of reality.

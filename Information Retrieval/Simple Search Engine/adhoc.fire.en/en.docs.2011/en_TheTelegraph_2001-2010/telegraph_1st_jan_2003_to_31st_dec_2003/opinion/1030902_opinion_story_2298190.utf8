		 Tuesday, September 02, 2003  RACISM IS THE NEW AGENDA
 Gwynne Dyer They sent Pauline Hanson to jail  for three years last week on charges of electoral fraud.  The One Nation party that she founded did not have the 500  members that she claimed when she registered it in 1997,  but only 500 signatures from an unofficial support group.  She also got half a million Australian dollars from the  state of Queensland by fraud to fight the 1998 election  there. Bad Pauline  but she has changed the country anyway. The reason why I got into politics  was to make a difference, Hanson said earlier this year,  when her challenge to established Australian parties had  already faded. When you have the government and the prime  minister take up your policies, I think you have made a  difference. And that is just what has happened: John Howard,  Australias second longest-serving prime minister, has ensured  his longevity by becoming Pauline Hanson in drag. Hanson herself is a familiar phenomenon  in democratic politics: a right-wing populist who exploits  the issues of race and immigration to create a following.  She first ran for parliament in 1996 as a candidate of Howards  Liberal Party, but was de-selected when they realized  how extreme she was: Asian immigrants were synonymous with  crime and disease, she said, and she wanted to slash government  spending on health, education and housing for the desperately  poor aborigines. No longer the outcast It turned out that many Australians  felt the same way. Hanson won her seat as an independent  in 1996, and founded One Nation the following year. In its  first national election, in 1998, it won an astonishing  eight per cent of the vote. All the major Australian political  parties used to cooperate to keep people like Hanson off  their candidates lists, but once she demonstrated how big  the market for racism was, their common front broke. The  first sign of what was to come was prime minister Howards  refusal to condemn Hanson in the 1998 election. Howard is not a racist; he is  just a skilled political operator who recognizes what works  and is not hampered by scruples. His Liberal Party began  to steal bits of Hansons agenda  and then two years ago  came the golden opportunity of the Tampa, a Norwegian  freighter that rescued 434 Afghans from a sinking ship in  the Indian Ocean and headed for Australia. The Afghans had been heading for  Australia anyway intending to claim asylum, but international  law obliged Australia to allow these survivors to come ashore  at the nearest port. Howard, weeks away from an election  and lagging in the polls, refused to let them land  and  when the captain of the Tampa ignored Canberras  instructions and kept steaming towards Australian territory,  Howard sent the Australian Navy and Special Air Service  troops to seize the ship. Closed doors Most Australians cheered his action,  for they had already half-accepted the line peddled by Hanson  and echoed by dozens of shock-jock radio call-in hosts  that the country was being inundated with illegal immigrants.  In fact, Australia only gets a few thousand illegalsa  year, far fewer than most other rich countries. In matters  of this sort, however, perception is everything  and the  perception is that Australia is being overrun by non-whites. A few weeks later Howard won the  election, collecting most of the votes that once went to  Hansons party (which had virtually destroyed itself in  vicious internal battles in the meantime). And now Hanson  has gone to jail, but she has left Australia a changed place. What was once redneck talk shunned  by educated people is now part of the national political  discourse, and the lurid fears of the racists are seen as  reasonable concerns that need to be addressed. The principal  beneficiary of this shift is none other than John Howard,whose  Liberal Party disowned Hanson only seven years ago. As one  Australian commentator said: He is a genius of sorts. He  looks this country in the face and sees us not as we wish  we were, not as one day we might be, but exactly as we are.

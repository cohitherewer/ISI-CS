		 Sunday, April 27, 2003 				 ANOTHER MOTHERS DAY
																								Mothers day can happen anywhere, on any date. In Tamil Nadu, it has just happened. The government there has decided to go against the tradition of children invariably taking the first letter of their fathers name as initial. Instead, it is listing three options. The traditional form can be retained, but the mothers name can be given equal importance if so desired. A child can take the first letters of the names of both his parents, placing the initial from his mothers first and that from his fathers second, or, even more unconventionally, use just the first letter of his mothers name as his only initial. Since this will be accepted on school admission forms, it would remain his name for all official purposes. That this issue should be raised in 2003 may be an implicit comment on the status of mothers  and women  in India, but that is not to take away from the level of awareness displayed by the state governments decision.																								The system of naming is culture-specific, but the broader implications this decision has for a mothers legal and social identity mark a small step in the slow process of empowerment for women in India. The mother-figure, glorified in myth, legend, and anecdote, is imbued with the values of self-effacing sacrifice and ever-forgiving love, with silent strength, limitless patience and uncomplaining fortitude. That makes virtues of eminently exploitable attributes, a social sleight-of-hand that is both fed and perpetuated by economic arrangements advantageous to a system evolved through a male perspective. The mother is the fount of family values, ideally secluded from questions of ownership and lineage. The child is the mothers at home and the fathers outside it. Only when equal recognition is given to the mother as parent on official documents, both the childs and the mothers identities undergo a change. Obviously, this is extremely heartening for single mothers. But the decision has much wider ramifications. It tends towards altering the social arrangement itself, through a change in mindset. When guardianship is equal, the identity of the father or the fathers family alone no longer remains the sole official and legal marker of the childs background. And the mothers position acquires a new dimension within the family as well.																								No social change takes place in a day, nor can legislation by itself effect the change. The many supportive laws and rulings by the courts regarding gender justice as in dowry prevention, inheritance, alimony and so on have not yet shown the hoped-for results. But such provisions act in two ways. One, they are an indication of what society should aspire to be and two, they are there for women who need them. By suggesting the possibility of empowerment, they also increase it. A few years earlier, for example, a long fight with the court ultimately established that the mothers signature would be sufficient to open a minors account in a bank. It is only by such small steps that empowerment can come to Indian women, because the quality and extent of their disempowered condition are still intricately tied in with the dominant economic, political, social and ideological systems of the country.

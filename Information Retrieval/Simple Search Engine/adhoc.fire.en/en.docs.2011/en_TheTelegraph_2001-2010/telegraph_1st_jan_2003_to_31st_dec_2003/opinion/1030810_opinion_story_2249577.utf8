 The West Bengal chief ministers  efforts to revive the state will go to waste with his New  Delhi comrades objecting to the verdict against strikes The real enemies of Mr Buddhadeb  Bhattacharjees project to bring capital into West Bengal  are his comrades in New Delhi. The news that leaders of  the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in New Delhi have  opposed the Supreme Courts verdict that the right to strike  is not a fundamental one will not please those investors  thinking of putting their money into business ventures in  West Bengal. The state is run by the CPI(M) under the cover  of something called the Left Front. Potential investors  reading about the strong speeches made by the likes of Mr  Somnath Chatterjee will wonder if their money will be safe  in a CPI(M)-ruled state. Their fears will be compounded  by the responses of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions in  West Bengal. It could be argued that such reactions from  a communist party are only to be expected. Communists, since  the time they emerged out of the pages of The Communist  Manifesto, have always upheld their right to strike  and have always used that right as a legitimate weapon of  protest. Despite this history, the Indian comrades, by opposing  the Supreme Courts verdict at this particular juncture,  are doing something that is utterly self-defeating. West  Bengal is the only secure base for the CPI(M). In most other  parts of India, save Kerala, it is a non-existent political  force. The partys influence and its wealth comes largely  from West Bengal. It can be said without too much exaggeration  that if West Bengal dies, the CPI(M) dies too.																								It stands to reason therefore that the CPI(M), to preserve its own interests, should rejuvenate West Bengal. Mr Bhattacharjee, the chief minister, realizes this as do some of his ministerial colleagues and party comrades in Alimuddin Street. Hence, the efforts to give West Bengals image a boost and to create conditions favourable for investment in the state. Mr Bhattacharjee has largely been successful in this venture and there is a noticeable change in perceptions about West Bengal. It is no longer seen as a state where industrialists are at the mercy of trade unionists and party cadre. Confidence-building is by no means complete and neither is the transformation in work culture. But all this will suffer a setback by the protests of the CPI(M) leaders in New Delhi and by CITU. Investors will not make the fine distinction between Mr Bhattacharjees efforts and the rhetoric of the New Delhi comrades. In the latters protests, potential investors will read the signs of the return of strikes and the red bogey in West Bengal and thus be shy of the state.																								The plight of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in this context is actually a reflection of a crisis facing the CPI(M). The latter refuses to recognize that the ism it upholds is dead and has a presence only in the history of political theory. Yet in West Bengal, the CPI(M)s stronghold, the government, with the tacit support of the party, pursues a policy of wooing capitalists and investments. The ideology and the practice are at odds with each other. The shadow of this paradox falls on Mr Bhattacharjee who has so recently changed his spots. The CPI(M) will have to decide which is more important to it: a moribund ideology or a rejuvenated West Bengal which it can showcase as an achievement.

		 Saturday, May 24, 2003  A DIFFERENT VIEW OF THINGS
 Most Arab leaders and media are unwilling  to reassess their views of the war, but Barry Rubin thinks  some may yet consider what lessons could be learnt  The author is director of Global Research  in International Affairs Center and editor of the Middle  East Review of International Affairs Journal Out of the box  Within the past month, Iraq has  been the scene of jubilation and some angry protests. Major  fighting has ended, but major reconstruction has yet to  begin. Regional reaction has ranged from relief to resignation  and despair. What firm conclusions, then, can be drawn about  reactions to the war from the Arab world?  The region is still in shock over  the speed and ease with which the American and British forces  swept into Baghdad. This is all the more true because pro-Iraq,  anti-American propaganda broadcasts by regional media outlets  were widely accepted in the Arab world. Muhammad Said al-Sahaf,  the former Iraqi information  or rather disinformation   minister, became famous in America for his outrageous  misstatements of fact, including his steadfast denial that  US forces were even in Baghdad. It is difficult to estimate  the extent to which Arab viewers actually believed his reports,  but indications are that they certainly wanted to believe  in a ferocious Iraqi resistance.  To cite two examples, when I appeared  on a panel discussion programme on Lebanese television,  I was shouted down by Arab co-panelists, who insisted that  US forces were carpet-bombing Baghdads residential neighbours.  Al-Jazeera, which is a fairly typical example of Arab media  coverage, presented one expert who claimed that the United  States of America was only able to capture Baghdad because  it used nuclear weapons to incinerate thousands of Republican  Guard troops.  In considering Arab reaction to  these events, one must first establish the type of information  and analysis available to that audience. By doing so, it  is possible to conceive a view very different from that  which was engendered by Western media coverage.  Not surprisingly, the primary  reaction in the Arab world  from politicians, the media,  opposition leaders, and establishment intellectuals  was  very much along the lines of traditional thinking. Victory  over Iraq was seen as one more humiliation by Western imperialism  and international Zionism. Saddam Hussain is viewed as either  a failure because he didnt fight to the last Iraqi, or  the victim of a criminal conspiracy. While many Arab intellectuals  who now condemn the US action once claimed to revile Saddam  as an oppressive dictator, few of them rejoiced at his actual  downfall and the liberation of the masses who suffered from  his rule.  As for the wars future implications,  pan-Arab nationalists insist that greater Arab solidarity  is needed to redress their weaknesses. Islamists suggest  that Saddams failure was caused by a failure to apply Islam  by that regime. Egyptian leaders are once again proposing  an Arab security system, led by Cairo, which would mediate  all disputes without the need for foreign intervention.  Al-Qaida says that the Iraqi defeat merely underscores the  inadequacy of conventional military and vindicates their  reliance upon guerrilla terrorist tactics.  None of this is necessarily the  last word, of course. What we have seen so far is only the  first act of a longer-term drama. Much hinges on what reactions  we might see to the scenes still to come, including the  establishment of a new Iraqi government, the turnover of  oil assets to it by the US, the institution of Iraqi democracy,  the departure of US forces, and the enjoyment of a better  life by Iraqis. The Arab reaction following some or all  of these developments will be more important than the initial  response to the war itself.  Equally valid is the reality that  what is largely seen by observers is the official version  of the reaction, coming from sources interested in downplaying  the significance of these events. Arab governments in general,  state-owned media, establishment intellectuals and journalists,  and leaders of militant opposition groups have a vested  interest in defending the Arab status quo, denouncing  US policy, demanding resistance, and rejecting the need  to draw lessons.  There are, however, some within  the Arab world who take a different view of events. First  and foremost, there are the Iraqis themselves, at home and  abroad, who are very pleased with the outcome of the war  and the fall of Saddam. They are grateful to the US for  liberating them, even though questions about what it should  do now remain controversial.  It should be understood, though,  that there is an enormous gap between these Iraqi perspectives  and what the rest of the Arab world hears or seems to think.  Arab media sources present a disproportionately high number  of anti-American Iraqi voices, at the expense of potentially  dissenting moderate views that applaud Saddams downfall,  which are usually expressed nowadays by Kuwaitis, Saudis,  and to a lesser extent, those from the other Gulf Arab states.  One argument, commonly articulated  by more moderate Egyptian and Lebanese intellectuals, might  be called Saddam exceptionalism. Their point is that Saddam  was such a terrible dictator and such a threat to the region  that the US was justified in overthrowing him. Even if they  do not support broader political change or any further action  by the US, they are glad to see the end of Saddams rule  Indeed, this argument is popular  because it fits well with a popular moderate spin on the  traditional perspective: that Saddam was terrible in part  because his adventurism and extremism provoked US intervention,  which all Arabs should oppose out of nationalistic considerations.  Paradoxically, the fact that Saddam forced the US to attack  him provided one more reason why Arabs who generally oppose  US intervention should be glad that American forces eliminated  him. The implication is that without Saddam in the picture,  everything can go back to normal.  There are also some Arab liberals   most prominently in Kuwait  who are enthusiastic about  the idea of regional change and democracy. They view the  war and its outcome not as an Arab defeat, but as the potential  basis for the greatest of all Arab victories: the creation  of successful, developed, peaceful society where human rights  are respected.  One trend accelerated by the war  is the rapidity with which some Arab states have embraced  at least some gesture toward political change. Bahrain,  Kuwait, Qatar, and even Saudi Arabia seem more open to talking  about serious change and considering new ideas than Egypt,  Syria or even the Palestinians. This is an important trend  to watch closely in the post-Saddam west Asia.  At the same time, it is easy to  overestimate any direct effect of events in Iraq on the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Saddams downfall removed  a man whom the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, saw as  his greatest Arab ally and arguably offers the lesson that  it is better to work with the US and avoid extremism. But  developments on that other front seem to be going along  the same lines as they were before the war. There is a great  debate in the West about the impact of the Iraq war and  its aftermath on the Arab west Asia. Some believe it is  going to create a new and enlarged constituency that advocates  democracy, reform, and moderation. Others expect that there  will be little effect or perhaps even a backlash against  the US intervention. Though there are several indicators  so far, conclusions and closure will remain elusive for  some time. The final act of this drama remains to be played  out not only because of the time needed for Arab response  to develop but also because Iraq itself is in an early stage  of transition.

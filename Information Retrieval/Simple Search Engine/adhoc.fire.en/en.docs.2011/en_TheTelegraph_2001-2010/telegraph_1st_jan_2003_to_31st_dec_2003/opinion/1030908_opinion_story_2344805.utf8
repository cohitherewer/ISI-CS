 - India can expect its power system to improve slowly but  steadily  COMMENTARAO / S.L. RAO The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission  raoslhotmail.com All Indians must have been mightily  amused by the front-page headlines and the continuous talk  of an emerging crisis, when the electricity failed in  much of the United States of America. Blackouts are a daily  occurrence outside metropolitan towns. Even in these privileged  places, the electricity fails for a while almost every day.  India must be the largest market in the world for stabilizers,  inverters and other devices to give backup power and protect  delicate equipment from being harmed by sudden power voltage  surge or complete power failure. Also for a variety of stand-by  generators, varying from those suitable for apartments to  factories of different sizes. While no one knows for sure,  the captive generation capacity in India is estimated  at an additional 25 per cent or so of the 105,000 megawatts  of generation capacity in the country. This is not counting  the smaller generators used in small factories, shops and  residences. Despite this, a team of three  from the federal energy regulatory commission of the US  is to visit India for studying how we manage our grid. A  member of FERC who was visiting the central energy regulatory  commission (of India) in 2000 commented that our interconnected  grid and the national electricity grid code, that we were  then preparing to approve, were what was needed in the US.  Federal constitutions as in the US and in India make protection  of states rights almost nationalistic in fervour. People  and politicians forget that electricity follows the laws  of physics. It does not care about political boundaries.  It will flow along any line that is available. When your coal is largely in the  North and in the East, as are your hydropower stations,  as in India, power has to flow over long distances to the  consuming areas. Many of the transmission lines on which  it flows are state-owned. If those lines are not maintained  well and if there is not adequate capacity in them, the  power will not flow and be wasted. During times of the year,  power in the East and Northeast is wasted because there  is still inadequate transmission capacity. But things are  getting better as the Central government is investing heavily  in inter-state transmission. But state governments are bankrupt,  and in many states the intra-state lines are badly maintained,  with little investment in new lines.  But in India there has been considerable  centralization, with states becoming less vigorous in electricity.  In the US however, states rights are carried so far that  many states have blocked inter-state transmission lines  from being built so that they can sell their power at high  rates to a contiguous state. This does not happen in India. The single greatest weakness of  electricity in India has been that it is a concurrent subject  under the Constitution. States have not bothered about commercial  viability or with good management. As a result every state  has a bankrupt and inefficient electricity system that cannot  ensure that electricity is available and at affordable rates.  But because we are able to move electricity over long distances,  a lot more power has been made available to deficit states.  This capability is improving. We also regulate our inter-state  movement of electricity very well, better than states do  within their boundaries. The US can learn from how we do  it. But they can do so only if they resolve their political  problem of states rights as they apply to electricity. Electricity quality is measured  by two main parameters  frequency and voltage. If frequency  varies beyond a very small margin from the norm, large moving  equipment like turbines in power stations, equipment in  steel plants, textile mills, and so on, suffer expensive  damage. In India, there is no measurement of this damage  whose cost must be enormous. There is no possibility that  power companies and regulators that allow such frequency  variation to happen can be penalized for their negligence. Frequency has been brought under  better control in most of India by an order issued by the  CERC called the availability-based tariff. This is a commercial  mechanism to introduce discipline among electricity generating  stations and load distributors. It has worked very well,  although state electricity boards and most Central government  electricity companies bitterly resisted its introduction  and tied it up in the courts for many years.  To understand it, we can use the  analogy of road traffic. Two cars or any two objects cannot  occupy the same space on the road. So there are rules and  signals. Roads and other equipment must be properly maintained.  There must be monitoring and policing of traffic. Electricity  is far more complicated because it must have transmission  lines. ABT punished electricity generators and distribution  companies for indiscipline on the electricity grid. They  are fined heavily for exceeding or falling short of their  forecasts. This enables others in the system to make extra  profit by supplying when electricity is short and buying  when it is in surplus. The fines, charged to those who forecasted  wrongly, are available to give better or lower prices to  the ones who came to the rescue of the system by supplying  or using the power. The other measure of quality is  voltage that also fluctuates widely and damages delicate  electronic and other electrical equipment. Voltage is also  improving in India due to similar actions by the regulators.  Neither frequency nor voltage has been a problem in the  US. However, in the recent blackout, frequency must have  gone out of the desirable limits. The system must then have  begun shutting down to protect itself. India has also had widespread  system collapses or blackouts like the one recently in  the US. Blackouts occur because the generating and distributing  equipment are designed to shut down when the supply or demand  goes beyond equilibrium and consequently the frequency goes  beyond limits that the equipment can tolerate. When this  happened in January 2001 in the North, the CERC called an  emergency hearing to establish who the culprit was. This  had never been done before. CERC came out with its findings  within two days. The culprits were Central-government-owned  generating companies and the Uttar Pradesh state electricity  board. One had continued to push electricity into the system  when they should have reduced it to safeguard the system  because the demand was less and hence the frequency was  rising. The other had not maintained the lines within the  state and that caused less power to flow on those lines.  The result was an unacceptable rise in frequency. The regional  load despatch centre (that is the traffic policeman of the  grid) kept issuing warnings. Both parties did not heed them.  The despatch centres overseer, the central transmission  utility, also did not give the load despatch centre enough  support against the violators. By the next grid collapse in the  West, the lessons had been learnt. The system worked well.  The culprit was Madhya Pradesh that kept drawing more power  than it had been given despite many warnings. The state  was fined. Others in the system saved the system. The engineers  were alert and ensured that they were not leaving it only  to their computers, but they were monitoring the system  in person. They were able to bring the system back into  operation quickly. The Indian regulatory environment  is working. Our system may creak and not have enough electricity  for all at affordable prices but yet it is better able to  avoid blackouts than it was some years ago. We are also  able to use our surpluses in one part of India to meet the  deficits in another. As transmission improves and electricity  trading takes off, this will get better. We can expect our  power situation to improve slowly but steadily. However,  we need to learn a great deal from the US. We are certainly  no model electricity system who can invite other countries  to copy us.

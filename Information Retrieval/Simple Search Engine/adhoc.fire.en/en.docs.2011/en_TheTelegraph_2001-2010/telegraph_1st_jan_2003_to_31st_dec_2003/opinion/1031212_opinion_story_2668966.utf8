																								There had been little doubt that the pro-Kremlin United Russia would win in the Russian parliamentary elections, and that this would help Mr Vladimir Putin win a second term as president next year. So it is the demise of the opposition more than the scale of United Russias victory that is now matter for concern to the West. The Communist Party did get into parliament, with only 12 per cent of the vote in place of 24 per cent last time. The communists backing of oligarchs had not evoked a positive response from traditional supporters in a country where the beginning of economic reforms had brought about a society composed of the very poor and the very rich. It was instead the newly-created nationalist party, Rodina, that pledged to raise company taxation and redistribute among the poor the fortunes made by businessmen in the first flush of privatization. The votes it got by hijacking part of the communists agenda were almost a straight subtraction from the communists support. As carefully thought-out in its rhetoric and promises as the Kremlin probably thought necessary, the Rodina also provided an alternative to the strident rhetoric of the Liberal Democratic Party, which dropped behind the communists in the counting.																								What has most alarmed the West is the decimation of the liberal parties, which were crucial in getting economic reforms through parliament and were signally important in the growing debate on democracy. It is not clear whether Mr Putin himself is overjoyed at the defeat of the Yabloko, led by the economist, Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, and the Union of Right Forces or the SPS, an advocate of the free market. Economic reform is essential to the Wests positive perception of Russia, which the president himself has done much to promote. But Kremlins managed democracy, with its full control over the state media, has bred a peculiarly one-sided parliament. Mr Putin could now change the constitution to get himself a third term, although he has said he will not. More worrying is the Yukos affair, in which the oil tycoon, Mr Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a critic of Mr Putin with presidential ambitions, has been jailed. Fears are that this means a review of the fruits of the early Nineties privatizations. As it is, Chechnya remains an uncomfortable subject. The presence of the army and the victory of a Kremlin-supported president in the republic have prolonged the cycle of violence and terrorism, as the bombing near the parliament the day after the election results clearly showed. Controlled democracy supported by nationalist parties conjures up the shadow of authoritarian rule too sharply to be comfortable for the West.

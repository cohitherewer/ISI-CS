																								Politicians speak in code. Other politicians know how to decipher it. Thus the obvious has a significance which lies beneath the surface and literal meaning. When Ms Sonia Gandhi, the president of the Congress, says that the question about her being a prime ministerial candidate will be decided by the people of India, she is saying something more. In a democracy, this hardly needs any reiteration. The fact that Ms Gandhi said it suggests that she was trying to say something else. She was indicating to interested parties that she and the Congress are not inflexible on the matter. She was telling potential allies that during negotiations the subject of the prime ministerial candidate should not be assumed to be a closed chapter in her favour. The Congress has thus declared that it is a political party in search of allies to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party and the National Democratic Alliance. The principle hurdle in the formation of an anti-BJP alliance has been the Congress position that Ms Gandhi would be the prime minister if the alliance came to power. This assertion of the Congress is based on the role Ms Gandhi has played within the party. She has held the party together and has commanded loyalty. She allowed space to important regional leaders to hold sway in their provinces. But she has held the strings in the central high command.																								Unfortunately for Ms Gandhi, these accomplishments at the party level do not qualify her to be prime minister. Ms Gandhi, with her written speeches, within and without Parliament, has failed to inspire any kind of confidence. In the Lok Sabha as the leader of opposition, she has failed to make a mark. She has appeared as uncertain and fumbling. She has displayed no special abilities for speaking directly to the people except though prepared addresses. More importantly, she has failed to articulate any kind of vision for the country. She has been reluctant as a reformer and faltering in her advocacy of secularism. She has brought unity to the party but not direction. The opposition to her does not arise from the fact that she was not born an Indian. On the contrary, the opposition to her is based on her lack of achievements in the realm of leadership. Her abilities to take strong and unpopular decisions have never been on display. This assessment of Ms Gandhi is based on her performance over a fairly long period of time. She has made a nuanced and diplomatic statement pregnant with suggestions. But political leadership is also about expressing a vision and about leaving ones own stamp on events. Neither of these can be done through code or by an enigma.

		 Friday, November 07, 2003 				 VEHICLE OF ROYAL PASSIONS
 Once resplendent on their ornate  palanquins, pedigreed horses, bedecked camels and magnificently  decorated elephants, the princes of India took to the motorcar  with a passion since the beginning of the 20th century.  THE AUTOMOBILES OF THE MAHARAJAS (Eminence, Rs 3,000)  is a fascinating chronicle of that passion. The accompanying  picture  showing Maharani Chandrawati Devi Holkar of Indore  having an al fresco picnic with her staff in front  of her 1915 Wolseley  tells the tale of the Maharanis  affair with the motorcar. Another interesting use of the  De Dions, Bugattis, Cadillacs, Hispano Suizas and Rolls  Royces was during the shikars, when tigers and bucks  (albeit dead) would provide the royals company on their  way back. The restored cars in their modern lonely confines  in the final chapter are silent witnesses of the days when  the Jamsahib of Nawanagars breakdown car was no less than  a Rolls.

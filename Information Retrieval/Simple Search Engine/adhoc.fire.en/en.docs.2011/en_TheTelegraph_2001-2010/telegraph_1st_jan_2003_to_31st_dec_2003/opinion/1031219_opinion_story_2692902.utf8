The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, December 19, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Powerless strike				 																																																				Sir  If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can never imagine declaring war against his own indisciplined and truant employees, he couldnt be doing his best to stop the closure of factories in West Bengal (Buddha strike fire on Jaya, Dec 14). The complete lack of work culture in Bengal has been a prime reason why investors and industries are fleeing the state, and why Gucci didnt even consider it worthwhile to send a task force to Bengal. The states bad reputation obviously travels faster than its dhoti-clad chief minister. No amount of beating of breasts at leftist trade union conferences or endorsements of faith in the workforce will change that simple fact. Perhaps the chief minister forgot to mention in Chennai that back home in Bengal, the people had already declared their deep disgust for rallies and strikes. Bhattacharjee may continue to hate J. Jayalalithaa as much as he wants, but the lady has shown more guts than our babu can ever dream of. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, J. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Which way now?				 																																																				Sir  The alacrity with which the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Uma Bharti, has banned cow slaughter is likely to send alarm bells ringing through the minds of many right thinking people of the country (Early elections hang in balance, Dec 14). This one act, committed the instant Bharti assumed charge, may well confirm the charges of instigating communal passions brought by the Congress and other parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party. One would have expected the newly formed BJP state government to practice patience and prudence, particularly in all matters that touch the minority community. A party that will face its most serious test next year should know that mature decisions are more important in this hour than impulsive actions. For the BJP to become truly national, it should watch its steps and ensure fairplay for all sections of the people. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
V. Srinivas, Nagpur

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Uma and windfall visit Tirupati temple (Dec 12) was heartening since it revealed the amount of donations rich temples like the Tirupati receive. It would be even more heartening if the amounts so received were spent by the temples for charity so that the deprived and helpless who throng the temple from far flung areas also get to experience the blessings of the lord more tangibly. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Utpal Borpatragohain, Dibrugarh

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Stung Sonia shoots secular salvo (Dec 14) was quite entertaining. With the BJP unseating the Congress in three states, the president of the party seems to have gone back to the partys trusted vote-catching formula of secularism. But doesnt the realization come a bit late in the day? For the first time in Gujarat and now again in Madhya Pradesh, the soft-Hindutva approach has proved to be a complete failure. But instead of reverting back to its secularist image, what the Congress needs to affirm is a killer instinct. For unless the Congress assures for itself a comfortable position in Parliament, Sonia Gandhi can be sure that she will find the Bofors gun trained at her once again. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																Look again				 																																																				Sir  Debabrata Mohantys report, Pollution caution for Puri bathers (Oct 27), on the discharge of effluents from hotels in Puri into the beach is alarming. The Orissa pollution control board is supposed to collect samples from hotels regularly to check the biological oxygen demand level of the discharged fluid. Only after it is satisfied is a consent letter, which remains valid for a year, issued to a hotel. In addition, the entire sewage of this temple city apparently goes to a treatment plant through drains which also cater to the sewage of the hotels. So there is no way the hotels can be blamed entirely for the high level of pollution on the beaches. 				 																																																				A hotel is a congregation of a number of residential units. If a hotel is blamed for releasing pathogens which cause communicable diseases, then any individual household of Puri can also be regarded as a potential offender. The hoteliers of Puri contribute a major chunk of the government revenue through direct and indirect taxes, including drainage tax paid to the municipality. The onus lies with the municipality for properly treating the sewage before releasing it to the sea. As an aware citizen of Puri, I see in this campaign a design to jeopardize the tourism industry of the city.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Uttam Dutta, Puri

				 																																																				Sir  It is hard to believe that Calcuttas administrators are at all bothered about the ever-increasing pollution in the city. The garbage-laden boulevard at the entrance of Meghnad Saha Sarani from the S.P. Mukherjee Road end is used by hundreds of street dwellers as their open air toilet. For hundreds of people, the lakeside roads at the Rabindra Sarovar area is the only decent place for an evening walk. But the caretakers have, for some strange reason, found it necessary to sweep and burn the dry leaves only towards the evening. The solution for these simple problems do not need any special funds or help from the Central government. A little sympathy and concern for the city could go a long way in keeping it habitable.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Kolaghat thermal power station township is situated beside the national highway numbers 6 and 41. Ever since the National Highways Authority of India started work on the expansion of these highways, the dust pollution in the township has gone up to alarming levels. Soon people in the township will be deprived of whatever little fresh air they had till now. Our complaints to the local authorities of the NHAI seem to have fallen on deaf ears. Could the higher authorities please arrange for a speedy redressal of the problem?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Debapriya Mitra , Kolaghat

				 																																																				Sir  One simple way to lesson the problem posed by plastic cups is to go back to the earthenware teacups.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

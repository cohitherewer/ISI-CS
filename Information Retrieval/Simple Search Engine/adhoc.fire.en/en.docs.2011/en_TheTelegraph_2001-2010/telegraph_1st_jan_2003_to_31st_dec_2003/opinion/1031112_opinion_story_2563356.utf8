 - Cooperation with the ASEAN will stabilize Indias relations  with China  J.N. Dixit The author is former foreign secretary  of India  A basis for dialogue The prime minister, Atal Bihari  Vajpayee, has just concluded his participation in the Association  of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Bali, Indonesia, as  well as his visit to Thailand. This has been the first visit  by an Indian prime minister to the Asean countries after  a gap of more than a decade. The last visit was by P.V.  Narasimha Rao in 1993. An overview of the historical background  of Indias relations with the Asean would be a relevant  context in which to assess the outcome of Vajpayees participation  in the Asean summit in Indonesia and the bilateral visit  to Thailand. India had shown keen interest  in joining the Asean during the second half of Rajiv Gandhis  tenure (between 1987-89). The Indian overtures were received  with some reticence at that point of time because leaders  of the Asean, more importantly the bureaucrats who shaped  the terms of reference of the Asean, retained memories of  India refusing to participate in the Asean in the mid-Sixties  when the Asean countries had invited India to join the forum.  Indias refusal to respond to the invitation was basically  because of the major Asean countries being closely allied  with the United States of America in the Vietnam war. The  South East Asian Treaty Organization was still an operational  alliance. With the benefit of hindsight  one can state that in the mid-Sixties, we should have compartmentalized,  to the extent possible, our economic interests on the one  hand and our geo-political orientations on the other. We  should have become a member of the Asean in the beginning  itself. Unfortunately, we didnt. It was only in the second half  of 1991 that the change in global power equations created  conditions conducive to India joining the Asean. The disintegration  of the Soviet Union accompanied by the fading away of the  strategic and military content of US-led alliances in southeast  Asia helped matters. The economic liberalization, restructuring  and reforms programmes initiated in India by the Narasimha  Rao government qualitatively changed circumstances, enhancing  possibilities of India joining the Asean, and dialogue was  re-initiated with the Asean governments by the government  of India. The discussions were held with individual members  of the Asean as well as with the Asean secretariat. Narasimha  Raos discussions with the Indonesian president, Suharto,  in 1992 and the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohammed,  earlier in November 1991, (on the margins of the non-aligned  and G-15 summit meetings) helped Indias initiative, and  by June-July 1992, India received formal confirmation from  the Asean secretariat that the Asean was ready to associate  India with the organization as a sectoral dialogue partner.  Governments of the US and Japan were supportive of the Indian  initiative regarding the Asean, given the adjustments which  India made in its foreign policy after the end of the Cold  War. India started functioning as a  sectoral dialogue partner with the Asean from 1993 onwards.  The dialogue focussed on structuring economic and technological  cooperation between the Asean countries and India. Progress  made, though slow, was satisfactory enough, for India to  become a full dialogue partner of the Asean during the last  months of Narasimha Raos tenure as prime minister in 1996.  Coming to the progress made in  Indo-Asean cooperation, India desired participation in the  political and security arrangements of the Asean, given  the Asean geo-strategic importance to India. The Asean leaders  who were reluctant to accept India in the security arrangements,  namely, the Asean Regional Forum, in the initial stages  primarily because they did not like the security forum to  be converted into an arena of India-Pakistan confrontations.  The period between 1996 and 1998 saw the slowing down in  drift in Indo-Asean internationals. The economic crisis  in the Asean countries in the late Nineties and the uncertainties  of Indias economic reforms policies contributed to the  phenomenon.  The situation changed for the  better once the Vajpayee government stabilized itself. Indias  nuclear tests created some hiccups but they were overcome  because by the time Vajpayee came into power, the Asean  accepted India as a part of the ARF. The then foreign minister,  Jaswant Singh, was able to utilize participation in ARF  meetings to explain the rationale of Indias nuclear weaponization.  The last four years saw incremental exchanges between the  government of India and the Asean government in the spheres  of economy, investment, technology, infrastructural cooperation  and so on. Vajpayees visit to the Asean  is a significant culmination of this process. The results  of the visit are based on the significance of the Asean  to India and vice versa. The Asean countries constitute  a market of nearly half a billion people. And combined with  the billion-strong population of India, cooperative arrangements  between the Asean and India would cover a population of  1.5 billion. China being a participant in the Asean raises  the demographic dimension of the cooperation to nearly three  billion people, constituting half or two-thirds of the population  of the world. The Asean countries and India  straddle all the major trade routes between the Atlantic  and the Indian Oceans on the one hand and the Pacific Ocean  on the other. The air, land and trade routes pass through  this region which are of vital importance to India. Indonesia,  Brunei, Malaysia and Myanmar are endowed with energy resources.  Subcontinental India and the Asean are rich in agriculture,  raw materials and natural resources. The positive impact  of broad-based economic cooperation has important potential. Security dimensions of cooperation  between India and the Asean are equally important. India  and the Asean countries face the common threat and share  concerns about international terrorism. Countries stretching  from the Philippines in the southeast to the western frontiers  of India have been subjected to terrorist violence and religious  extremism, particularly so since 1999-2000. Drug trafficking,  piracy at sea and smuggling are common threats which India  and the Asean countries face. The strategic and security  importance of India and the Asean region results in the  major powers of the world like the US, Russia, China and  Japan being interested in the stability of the region. These were the considerations  which underpinned Vajpayees brief for the Asean summit.  Three agreements were signed at the end of the Asean deliberations  on October 8. First, a framework agreement for the creation  of an Indo-Asean free trade area by the year 2011. Second,  an agreement to cooperate to counter terrorism, and the  third was India becoming a signatory to the Asean treaty  of amity and cooperation. The Indian delegation also put  forward significant suggestions which would be process-  ed. First, for creating a broad Asean economic community:  the membership would consist of 10 countries of the Asean,  China, Republic of Korea, Japan and India. Then there was  the suggestion for open skies arrangement by which all designated  airlines of the Asean countries can have free daily services  to New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Mumbai, without going  through the hassles of individual bilateral civil aviation  agreements. India also offered airlines of the Asean countries  access to 18 tourist destinations in India.  The movement towards creation  of a free trade area will commence by the winter of 2004,  with the exchange of tariff concessions and elimination  of tariff on an agreed common list of commodities on a reciprocal  basis. These are arrangements to be fully in place by 2006.  An agreement on the campaign against terrorism identifies  areas of cooperation. The broad features of emerging  trends in Indo-Asean cooperation are the increase in trade  with the Asean region to a value of nearly $ 12 billion.  Vajpayee has added the offer of information technology cooperation  which has been accepted by the Asean countries. The second  feature is the tangible increase in political and strategic  interaction between India and the Asean countries. Vajpayees  visit to Thailand would also contribute to cooperation in  two important fields: countering drug-trafficking and in  stabilizing relations with Myanmar.  In overall terms, the cooperation  with the Asean will contribute to a stabilization of Indias  relations with China, to India overcoming limitations of  the lack of progress in the South Asian Association for  Regional Cooperation, and thirdly, the agreements reached  may contribute to possibilities of cooperation, between  not only India and the Asean, but also between the Asean  and Indias other important neighbours, Bangladesh, Bhutan,  Nepal and Sri Lanka.

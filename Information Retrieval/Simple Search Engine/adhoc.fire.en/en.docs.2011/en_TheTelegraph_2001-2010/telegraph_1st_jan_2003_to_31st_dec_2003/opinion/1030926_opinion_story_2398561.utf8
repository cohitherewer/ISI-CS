		 Friday, September 26, 2003  THE NEW WAVE POET
 Arnab Bhattacharya Selected Poems of Buddhadeva Bose  Translated by Ketaki Kushari Dyson, Oxford, Rs 550 Bose with Horst  Frenz  Bengali poetry took a decisive  turn in the post-Tagore era. A crop of new poets in the  Twenties broke radically away from the Tagorean brand of  mystic spiritualism and idealized romanticism, seeking to  find a new poetic language to reflect their existential  angst in a society fast moving towards industrialization.  The modernizing trend of Bengali poetry gathered momentum  in the late Thirties and the whole of the Forties, with  World War II and rise of fascism in the global context and  famine, unemployment, refugee problems and the Partition  in the local context. The spread of Marxism and the setting  up of the Progressive Writers Association in the late Thirties  ensured that poetry could be used as a tool for changing  society. The progressive writers attacked Tagore as a  product of bourgeois culture. Broadly speaking, post-Tagore  Bengali poetry followed mainly two trends  non-Tagorean  and anti-Tagorean. Buddhadeb Bose belonged to the first  category. In her introduction, Ketaki Kushari Dyson competently  captures the changing perspective of Bengali poetry while  Tagore was still living: the bard, though not quite approving  of what came to pass as poetry, constantly tried to relocate  himself in the altered poetic landscape. She discusses the  circumstances which prompted Boses migration from Dhaka  to Calcutta in 1931, and the role of Boses contemporaries  of the Kallol era like Jibanananda Das, Amiya Chakravarty,  Sudhindranath Dutta, Bishnu De et al and of the poetry  quarterly, Kavita, which was published and edited  by Bose for nearly 30 years in shaping the future course  of Bengali modern poetry. The intermingling of the foreign  and the native in his poetic vocabulary was Boses way  of coming to terms with a diasporic consciousness. Boses  influence is apparent on the younger Krittibas group of  poets. But even Dyson falters occasionally.  In her urge to establish Bose as a nature-loving poet, she  has forgotten Boses intellectual intimacy with Charles  Baudelaire, whose poetry certainly influenced Boses later  poetic articulations. Dyson does not give details of the  books from which the poems have been selected for translation  here, nor the basis on which they have been selected. For  reasons best known to the translator, the titles of the  books have remained untranslated. For reasons best known  to her, the titles of the books remain untranslated. The  comparison between Jibanananda Das and Bose, which seeks  to project the latter as a more versatile poet, is too skin-deep  to be convincing. These apart, it must be granted  that the translations have been ably done, balancing loyalty  to the text with maintenance of the felicity of poetic style.  From the selection, it is not too difficult to trace the  progression of Boses poetic imagination  from Bandir  Bandana (1930) through Je-Andhar Alor Adhik (1958)  to Swagotobiday O Anyanyo Kavita (1971). Dyson writes  about the very real problems of preserving the original  line-lengths in English: though lines are often fragmented  and new lines are interpolated in translation, the syntactic  sinew of the lines is mostly unimpaired thanks to translators  creative intervention. One of Boses important essays on  language and poetry, written in protest against the report  of the government of Indias language commission, which  makes an interesting study when read alongside Walter Benjamins  article on the philosophy of language, has been included. One last question, though. Why  should the poets name be spelt Buddhadeva Bose? Did the  poet by any chance spell his name this way in English? ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

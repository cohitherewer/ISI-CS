		 Friday, December 19, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Tree shrews and false vampiresTall Tales (Puffin, Rs 199) by Jaspar Utley is a delightful collection of yarns told by an endearing old man in beautiful, slightly old-fashioned English (the sort thats hardly heard in India nowadays). Great-grandpa claims to be more than a hundred years old, with enormous hennaed whiskers, and he spent most of his time in his garden with the trees, bushes and flowers, many of which he had planted himself. He would sit on the small lawn in his favourite old white cane chair, surrounded and shaded by his creations, and drink cup after cup of sweet, milky tea. Woe betide anyone or anything that threatened his world. Heres a wistful mix of Narayan and Leela Majumdar, particularly in the endless stories that grandpa tells the children, unbothered by plausibility or political correctness. The last chapter is astonishing in its subtle portrayal of personal grief, revealing why grandpa told so many tales: they were his way of coming to terms with an unbearable reality. What will the Harry Potter generation make of such a simple, moving and delightful book like this? Debashis Debs lovely illustrations bring together the worlds of Ray and Laxman.																												Historical Dictionary Of Pakistan (Vision, Rs 495) by Shahid Javed Burki is an important and useful book of reference about an area of knowledge that has been prey to strategic misinformation for particular political reasons. Apart from the concise alphabetical entries, there is a detailed chronology, reading lists and factual appendices about presidents, prime ministers and army chiefs, Musharraf figuring only in the last. Burki was minister in charge of finance planning and economic affairs in the 1997-98 interim government.A field guide to indian mammals  (DK, Rs 595) by Vivek Menon is ideal for armchair  animal-watching. It is an elegantly designed and illustrated  recognition guide of Indias 400-odd mammals, the most  charismatic of all fauna. There are excellent chapters  on various aspects of mammalian life and conservation. The  survey begins with the primates and ends with whales and  the dugong or sea cow (secretive creatures of turbid waters).  Non-mammalists will derive endless delight from studying  the animal faces and expressions, and thinking up human  counterparts. Some of the names are also sheer poetry: fruit  bats, dawn bats, mouse-tailed bats and tomb bats, lesser  horseshoe bats, Schneiders leaf-nosed bats, false vampires,  free-tailed bats, painted bats, mouse-eared bats, harlequin  bats, flat-headed bats, tube-nosed bats, the common noctule  and pipistrelles. There is also a tree shrew.

		 Thursday, October 23, 2003  POCKETS OF BACKWARDNESS
 - Development and deprivation do not always follow state boundaries  Bibek Debroy The author is director, Rajiv Gandhi  Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi In my last column, I reported  some work Laveesh Bhandari and I have done in identifying  backward districts in India. The identification is based  on variables linked to the millennium development goals,  constrained by the problem of the lack of availability of  data at district-level. The variables used are poverty,  hunger, infant mortality, immunization, literacy and gross  enrolment rates. There is a set of around 70 districts that  are most backward and these are geographically concentrated.  There is a set of another 70 districts that are just above  the most backward category and these tend to be spread out  more spatially. Understandably, any such identification  is dependent on variables used for identification. In a  little more detail, here is broadly what we find. Poverty ratios show backward districts  not only in the undivided BIMARU (Bihar, undivided Madhya  Pradesh, Rajasthan, undivided Uttar Pradesh) states, but  also in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra  Pradesh, Orissa, West Bengal and the Northeast. Hunger (defined  in National Sample Survey terms) exhibits a similar  spatial distribution, but is less universal than poverty  and is also more concentrated towards the East and the Northeast.  Other than a few neighbouring districts of Karnataka and  Andhra Pradesh and the Northeast, the infant mortality rate  identifies undivided BIMARU and Orissa. Lack of immunization  is geographically a more serious problem, with a clear North  versus South divide. Low literacy rates are spread  throughout the country and expectedly, this is also mirrored  in gross enrolment rates. While there is some correlation,  it is not surprising that identification of backward districts  depends on which of the six indicators are used. For example,  under the poverty ratio criterion, Indias worst districts  are located in Bihar, UP, Jharkand, Orissa, MP, Assam, Maharashtra,  West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, with a few districts from  Arunachal, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu thrown in. Hunger has  a broader geographical spread, with hungry districts also  existing in Andhra, Goa, Haryana, Kerala, Manipur, Nagaland,  Pondicherry, Rajasthan, Tripura and Uttaranchal. The contrast  in spreads between the poverty criterion and the hunger  criterion, with the former more concentrated, is a finding  that needs emphasis. And this also has a policy angle.  Moving on to infant mortality,  the worst districts are in UP, Orissa, MP, Chhattisgarh  and Rajasthan. The worst-off districts under immunization  have a broader spread, with Bihar, Jharkhand, Arunachal,  Karnataka, Assam, Gujarat, West Bengal and the Northeast  also included. A somewhat surprising finding is the fact  that none of Bihars districts figure in the worst-off list  under infant morality, but several are included under immunization.  Conversely, Orissa has an extremely good record in immunization,  but a poor record in infant mortality. Immunization and infant mortality  ought to move together. Backwardness under the literacy  criterion is concentrated in Orissa, undivided BIMARU, Arunachal,  Karnataka, Andhra, Assam, Gujarat, Himachal, Jammu and Kashmir,  Punjab, West Bengal and the Northeast. The enrolment criterion  broadly mirrors this, with a large concentration in Bihar  and UP. Perhaps one should mention that several of Gujarats  districts are backward under the enrolment criterion. For each indicator, the identification  therefore throws up a set of districts. Is it possible to  identify backward districts across the six indicators? The  arbitrary cut-off  that a district is backward if it classifies  as backward in at least 4 out of the 6 indicators  is used.  Certainly, this selection is arbitrary, but one cannot completely  avoid arbitrariness. This throws up a list of 69 backward  districts  26 in Bihar, 13 in UP, 10 in Jharkhand, 10 in  Orissa, 6 in MP, 3 in Arunachal and 1 in Karnataka. These  are Indias most disadvantaged districts. But one should  mention that these 69 districts are the most backward. Geographically,  they are contiguous to another 70-odd districts that are  also fairly backward. What policy interventions are  required to ensure that these backward districts do not  continue to be marginalized? This is a difficult question  to answer and also concerns appropriate targeting of anti-poverty  programmes such as food security, employment guarantee schemes  and education and health-sector interventions. Backwardness  in Bihar, UP, Jharkhand and Orissa is more broad-based.  But there is a case for specifically targeting Gulbarga  in Karnataka, Changlang, Tirap and Lohit in Arunachal and  Chhatarpur, Damoh, Dhar, Jhabua, Panna and Tikamgarh in  MP.  This exercise does not explain  backwardness. We stop at identification. Explaining backwardness  will come later and will involve an econometric exercise,  seeking answers in connectivity, governance, institutions,  historical legacies and even land tenures. Having said this,  there is clearly a correlation between backwardness and  connectivity. For example, backward districts in Orissa,  Arunachal, Karnataka and MP are off the national highway  network and it is doubtful that satisfactory feeder roads  exist. This impression is reinforced when one notices that  many villages in backward districts are not connected to  pucca roads.  However, this argument does not  hold for Bihar, UP or Jharkhand. Barring Arunachal, rail  networks exist in these backward districts. That does not,  of course, mean that feeder roads exist. So do rivers, although  existence of rivers does not necessarily imply that navigable  waterways exist. Rather interestingly, in Bihar, UP and  Orissa, many of these backward districts tend to be flood-prone.  One knows this impressionistically and there are implications  for the river-linking project. But there is not much of  a correlation between backwardness and districts affected  by drought. This is contrary to what many people believe  and requires further probing.  At a somewhat simplistic level,  a two-point agenda then emerges. First, improve road-connectivity  in backward districts in Orissa, Arunachal, Karnataka and  MP. Second, solve the flood problem in Bihar, UP and Orissa.  Although not used for identification, some other variables  are also mapped. First, there is no obvious correlation  between access to safe drinking-water and backwardness.  Non-availability of safe drinking-water is almost a universal  phenomenon, spanning all states. Second, there is no obvious  correlation with safe delivery, the problem of women not  receiving skilled attention during delivery also being a  near-universal problem.  Third, there is not much correlation  between gender disparities, measured by the 0-6 sex ratio  and backwardness. If one ignores the Western parts of UP,  the correlation is almost negative. Fourth, gender disparity  measured by the ratio of female to male literacy leads to  the same kind of conclusion. Gender disparities cut across  backwardness. Fifth, there is some correlation (with the  exception of Arunachal) between low female work-participation  rates and backwardness. Sixth, there is a finding that is  again contrary to popular perception. There is not much  correlation between backwardness and existence of tribal  populations per se. While this is a valid correlation  if one restricts oneself to the central Indian core of backwardness,  it is not a correlation that is evident at an all-India  level.  This is by no means the last attempt  at identifying pockets of backwardness in India. At a broad-based  level, going beyond poverty ratios, this is certainly the  first. Hopefully, this exercise will stimulate interest  in taking the development debate beyond state boundaries  and thereby impart focus to districts. That is where the  deprivation is. And that is where the development needs  to be. As I said in the earlier article, state boundaries  are administrative ones. Development and deprivation do  not necessarily follow these boundaries.

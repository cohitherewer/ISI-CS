The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, October 05, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Diamonds and rust				 																																																				 Sir While it is certainly raining diamonds for Bharat Shah, the efficiency of the Mumbai police seems to have severely rusted (Shah walks, cops eat crow, Oct 2). Despite their claims of possessing incriminating audio evidence regarding Shahs links with the underworld, the police failed to nail the diamond merchant and producer of Chori Chori Chupke Chupke for want of conclusive evidence. Perhaps the Mumbai cops need to work more closely with legal experts to submit a foolproof case . Else, all the action-packed dramas put together by the police will end in such similar anti-climax.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Shivani Singh, Calcutta
				 																Celebrating a legend				 																																																				Sir  In the euphoria surrounding the birthday celebration of Lata Mangeshkar, it is easy to forget that her path to success was littered with numerous obstacles (Remix catches up with Lata, Sept 30). The winner of the Bharat Ratna and the Dadasaheb Phalke award has been the reigning deity of Hindi film music for nearly five decades. But on the way to super stardom, she has had to confront tough professional competition as well as personal setbacks like her strained relationship with her sister, Asha Bhosle. Her perseverance and determination saw her through. Instead of lauding the melody queen as a performer, we should pay our homage to Lata Mangeshkar as a human being. Heres wishing the legend the very best for the future.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia

				 																																																				Sir The glittering event organized to celebrate the 75th birthday of Indias musical legend, Lata Mangeshkar, saw politicians like L.K. Advani, and prominent members of the entertainment industry as well as scores of common people making a beeline for the sports complex which served as the venue for the event. The overwhelming response from the audience simply goes to show that Mangeshkar remains the undisputed queen of Indian music even today.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Robin Debnath, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is a pity that the media do not allow celebrities like Lata Mangeshkar to celebrate their birthdays away from the limelight. Mangeshkar, who normally goes out of Mumbai come September 28, was forced to be present at a badly organized celebration  complete with a potpourri of politicians, journalists and budding pop bands. Why cant the media respect the privacy of the stars.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jibon Shaha, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  During her birthday celebrations, Lata Mangeshkar said, If Mohammad Rafi, Talat Mahmood, Kishoreda, Hemantda were present today, they would have celebrated the occasion in great style. How true is her comment! With the passing away of the likes of Rafi, Kishore Kumar and others, the golden era of film music seems truly a thing of the past. Who will bear the flag after Lata Mangeshkar?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shankar Lal Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is ironic that fans chose to wish Indias melody queen with remixed versions of her own songs. Lata Mangeshkar could not have liked what she heard. She was, however, gracious enough to accept the tribute. The organizers of the show had better be careful not to repeat such a fiasco in future.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chandrima Mukherjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Lata Mangeshkars success speaks for her status as a performer. But what about her as a human being? She has done almost nothing for the common people of India to whom she owes her immense popularity and riches. Unlike other celebrities, she has neither championed the cause of the poor, nor is she known for her charities. The lions share of funds for her much vaunted hospital, named after her father, came from welfare concerts and large political donations. She is also known to abhor competition from upcoming artistes. But then, not all great performers are great human beings.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

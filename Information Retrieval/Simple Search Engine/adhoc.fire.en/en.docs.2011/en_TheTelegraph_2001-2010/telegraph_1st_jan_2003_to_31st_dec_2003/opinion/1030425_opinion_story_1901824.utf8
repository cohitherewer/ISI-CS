		 Friday, April 25, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Battles, fires, hunts and harems Jatakamala: stories from the  Buddhas previous births (HarperCollins, Rs 295)  translated by A.N.D. Haksar provides important evidence   according to the dalai lama, who writes the foreword   of the continuity between the Hinayana and the Mahayana  traditions of Buddhism. The originals here are by the Sanskrit  poet, Arya Shura, composed about 1,700 years ago, to be  later translated into Chinese. These are wonderfully readable  stories, taking in battles, voyages, forest fires and royal  hunts, moving through hell and harems, to provide ethical  instruction and narrative pleasure.  The gift of a daughter: Encounters  with victims of dowry (Penguin, Rs 200) by  Subhadra Butalia is a lucid polemic against dowry and  a personal account of a life of activism. From the nationalist  to the womens movement in India, Butalia, in her eighties  now, presents her own growing understanding of the problems  of Indian women. This is also the story of Karmika, a counselling  and legal aid centre run by the author for women victims  of domestic violence and dowry abuse. Informed by clear  thinking and a wealth of experience, Butalias slim volume  is an important but unobtrusive contribution to Indian womens  activism and its prolific literature. The maverick republic (Roli,  Rs 295) by Javed Laiq is a journalists clippings  file arranged thematically to cover thirty years of Indian  public life. The net effect is quite interesting, even entertaining,  giving the feel of how stories are made out of the stuff  of chaos and unpredictability. There are sections on Indira  Gandhis assassination and its aftermath, elections and  the Emergency. What emerges is a multifaceted anatomy of  the Indian democracy and the many faces of corruption that  it affords the critical eye.
 GeorgeJoseph: the life and  times of a Kerala christian nationalist (Orient Longman,  Rs 325) by George Gheverghese Joseph is a political  biography which locates its subject (the authors distinguished  grandfather) in the political and social context of modern  Indian history. It opens out into wider issues of the meanings  of secularism and affirmative action, and the position of  religious minorities in India. This book is also a social  history of the Syrian Christian community in India, focussing  on the life and times of one of its members. Joseph provides  an extremely detailed and personally insightful account  of a fascinating but forgotten figure in Indian history.

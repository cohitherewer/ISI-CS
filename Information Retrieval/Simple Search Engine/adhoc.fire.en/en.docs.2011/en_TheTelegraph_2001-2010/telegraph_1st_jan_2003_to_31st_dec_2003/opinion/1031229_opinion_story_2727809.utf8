		 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 WATCH THE BAKERY
																								In the recent history of Mr Narendra Modis winning ways, the Best Bakery case is turning out to be an astonishing chapter. As his state and nation march on to higher and greater things, the Gujarat pogrom is becoming part of a forgettable and disposable past. The experiment has yielded its fruits  electorally and in the larger cause of the war against terror. It has also created an icon of victory, embodied in the figure of the chief minister and party member, wooing investors in his own state and campaigning for his party elsewhere, in cooperation with his colleagues. Mr Modi is now an indispensable part of the new and shining India, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party towards unprecedented economic stability. But the Best Bakery case keeps coming up. Across the network of civic and political institutions in Gujarat, which invariably manages to muffle and distort the course of justice, falls the shadow of the Supreme Court. A local fast-track court had acquitted the Best Bakery accused, followed by the apex courts admonition. This forced the state government to go in for a token appeal, rejected by the Gujarat high court on the last day of its winter session. When the courts reasons for confirming the acquittal are disclosed later, there will, of course, be opportunities for further appeals. But the case has now been safely led into the labyrinth of endless referrals and deferrals  and India can carry on shining meanwhile.																								Here, then, is an obvious disjunction between the fast-track courts and the high court in Gujarat on the one hand and the Supreme Court on the other, leading to what is, in effect, the failure of the entire criminal justice system. But a deeper set of rifts can also be seen between the state government, the judiciary and the institutions of civil society (rights-based NGOs and the national human rights commission). The NHRC has filed for the retrial and transfer of several riots cases, while Citizens for Justice and Peace has been trying to protect the key witnesses. But it has been the singular achievement of the machinery of state to make their fight for justice look either like uncalled-for judicial activism or like a ridiculous and outmoded form of left-liberal political correctness. Apart from the Supreme Courts persistence in the matter, protesting against what has happened in Gujarat, and continues to happen there, has begun to look almost like a hippy movement, conducted in isolated venues by assorted rights activists or inconvenient celebrities (usually women, and usually from the minority communities). This is not only a perversion of justice, but also a mockery of the Indian polity and civil society  of the Constitution and the judiciary, and of the lives of individuals and communities.

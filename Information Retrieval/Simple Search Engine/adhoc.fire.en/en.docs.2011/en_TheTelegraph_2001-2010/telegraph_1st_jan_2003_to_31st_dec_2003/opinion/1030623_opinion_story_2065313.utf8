		 Monday, June 23, 2003  THE OUTSOURCING BACKLASH
 - Protectionism will cut outsourcing unless US companies intervene  Bibek Debroy The author is director, Rajiv Gandhi  Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi Businessworld has just  (June 16) done an excellent story on the outsourcing backlash  India faces in the United States of America. Since 70 per  cent of information technology exports are headed to the  US and the share is even more for business process outsourcing,  the backlash is most serious in the US, although there have  been ripples in Britain, Germany and even the Netherlands.  As Indians, we should feel flattered. East Asian and Chinese  successes in manufactured exports led to a barrage of anti-dumping  and anti-subsidy investigations. If our service exports  take off, we ought to expect such a backlash of protectionism.  Protectionism is correlated with  how an economy is doing. For instance, if US economic growth  inches up to 3 per cent or more and employment intensity  of growth also increases, protectionist pressures will fizzle  out. If not, jobs threatened now are white-collar ones.  This is different from blue-collar jobs moving to east or  southeast Asia. The threatened segments now are vocal ones,  with high decibel levels. A point can indeed be made about  developed country protectionism, as the commerce minister  has been doing. Thats true not only of cross-border movements  of labour, but also agriculture. But having made that point,  what recourse do we have in the case of any American action?  Depends on the form the action takes. The Businessworld story  mentions mushrooming of anti-immigration and anti-outsourcing  sites. It lists some of these sites, but doesnt quote from  them. I am going to give you some quotes, as these illustrate  possible forms of action. We are here to save American  jobs. We are not racists, xenophobes or bigots. We are displaced  American Workers. Displaced by a little known immigration  visa approved by congress at the request of large US corporations.  These visas known as H-1B and L-1 are used to import foreign  workers to replace American workers with cheap foreign labour.  The replacement started with US computer programmers and  engineers and is now taking hold in various professions  like nursing, teaching and truck drivers. Basically any  decent paying jobs are now targets of these large corporations  and government institutions. This is from http://www.h1bprotest.  com/protest/protest.asp.  There were 65,349 H1-B visas issued  in 1985, increasing to 294,658 in 2000. Again, 47,322 L-1  visas were issued in 1985, increasing to 355,605 in 2000.  The L-1 visa permits US employers, such as Oracle, to pay  third-world wages to tech workers from other countries,  even when they are working at US sites. There is NO LIMIT  on L-1 visas. Why would US employers EVER hire US workers?  This is from http://www.familyinjustice. com/h1b/. The promiscuous immigration programmes  for studies or work in the United States allow foreign terrorists  easy passage into the United States. Given the tragic events  of September 11, 2001, all non-immigrant visas should be  immediately halted in the interest of national security.  This is from http://www.zazona.com/Shame H1B/.  Stop all immigration now, legal  or illegal, during this time of war. Our national security  depends on it. We must rethink our entire immigration policy,  and this will take time. The systems and safeguards needed  to guarantee secure borders are years away. The INS will  then have the resources to more effectively track business  travellers and tourists, track down the 9 million illegal  aliens within our borders, and fix its systemic problems.  End student visas  This is a primary loophole for illegal  aliens and terrorists. Lower student demand for US colleges  will lower the cost of education for American kids as universities  will be forced to compete in a tighter market. American  kids will also be able to get into a better school. Our  kids should come first. Most universities are subsidized  by our tax dollars. Do we expect other nations to educate  our kids? This is from http:// www.stopimmigrationnow.org.  To get an H1B visa, you have  to have a degree. It is unfair to take the best-trained  and educated people from a poorer country like India and  allow them to come to the USA. The brain drain hurts these  countries and keeps them poor. Maybe that is what the US  government wants? It is true that the governments in India,  Africa and the Far East do not encourage entrepreneurs.  They really should. That is a totally different discussion.  The H1B programme hurts the country these workers come from  much more than it hurts the US economy. So maybe H1B visas  are good for us US programmers. Instead of an industry wide  competition, we get competition for individual jobs.  Actual cost of producing engineering  talent outside non-European countries (exception being France),  is in reality very comparable to the educational costs for  an engineer here in the US. However one point thats lost  in the fog, is that many of these same countries, have what  is known as free or heavily subsidized education at the  college/university levels and beyond. In other words, the  true cost of producing an engineer in, lets say India,  is in all realities equal to costs here. However, given  the fact that these actual costs are paid for by the home  governments, the rational conclusion is that indeed what  one has is price masking, or put a different way, selling  at well below true cost. If this isnt dumping, then WTF?  This is from http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show amp;ixPost=9419.  In my home state, you have now  adopted another country. After laying off approximately  170 occupational employees and 90+ management employees,  you have hired Indian Nationals from Ta Ta (sic) Corporation  to work on our so-called secure national phone system. Thru  Ta Ta (sic) Corp via H1B visas, you are training trainers  who will go back to India and start a remote workforce which  will have full access to our telephone system where they  can shut down, reroute, or even destroy our whole long distance  network. That India recently signed a telecommunication  information sharing policy with Iraq, is just another thing  that Americans dont need to know. This is from http://att.nac.net/  armstrong041402.h.  Here you have the essential ingredients  of possible action, especially for services done on-site.  First, tighten L1 visa procedures and impose caps. Second,  thanks to the Uruguay Rounds (1986-94) market access negotiations,  the US has a minimum commitment of 65,000 H1-B visas. Resist  pressure by US IT companies to increase actual H1-B visas  to above the bare minimum.  Third, the Doha development agendas  negotiations on services are at a request-offer stage. These  will eventually modify existing Uruguay Round commitments.  Services can be delivered through four means  mode one,  cross-border trade; mode two, consumption abroad; mode three,  commercial presence; mode four, presence of natural persons.  As a generalization, it is possibly true that developed  countries pushed for mode three during the Uruguay Round  and resisted mode four (the H1-B cap) and in the process,  did not pay sufficient attention to exemptions in, say,  mode three. Hence, some of the proposed anti-outsourcing  legislation in New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, Connecticut  and Missouri may very well be World Trade Organization-incompatible.  While opening up, and exemptions are functions of quid  pro quo obtained, negotiations will no longer be as  simple as mode three versus mode four.  Fourth, attempt to extend coverage  of anti-subsidy and anti-dumping agreements to cover services.  Fifth, bring in security through Article XXI of the general  agreement on tariffs and trade. Notwithstanding the WTO,  the 1947 GATT agreement still stands. Here is what Article  XXI(b)(iii) says: Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed  to prevent any contracting party from taking any action  which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential  security interests taken in time of war or other emergency  in international relations.  After 9/11, nothing more is needed  to justify protectionism. And as with actual number of H1-B  visas granted, the best antidote is pressure by US companies,  who find it in their commercial interests to outsource or  hire foreign workers.

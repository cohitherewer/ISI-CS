 R.S. Sharmas case illustrates that corruption at the top destroys the police forces commitment and encourages more corruption, writes Sankar Sen				 	 Doing a disservice?																								The arrest of R.S. Sharma, the former Mumbai police commissioner, in the Telgi scam has opened a can of worms. Investigation by a special investigation team has unearthed the Mumbai polices linkage, both at the senior and junior levels, but especially at the top, with the criminals  a discovery that has sullied the reputation of the police force beyond repair. 																								In a hierarchical organization like the police, the head of the force occupies a pivotal and unique position. By his exemplary conduct and professional competence he is supposed to inspire his subordinates and win the confidence of the public. The Indian police has been fortunate to have a number of such leaders. The Mumbai police has also had some distinguished commissioners who have displayed leadership of a high order. But there is no doubt that a man of doubtful integrity can wreak havoc and vitiate the atmosphere within the force.																								Which means that a director general or a commissioner of police has to be selected with utmost care. The reputation, good or bad, of officers is hardly a secret and the exclusion of corrupt officers is not a difficult task. Unfortunately, selection of the directors general or commissioners of police is increasingly becoming the prerogative of political masters who are the least interested in an officers individual merit. Honest and upright officers are considered inflexible, and therefore sidelined.																								Section 3 of the Police Act, 1861  passed by the British after the mutiny  which still governs the structure and working of the Indian police, lays down that the superintendence of the police shall vest in the state government. But in the name of superintendence, complete political control over the police is now exercised by the party in power. In each state, there are three or four officers of the same rank as the director general of police. If the head of police proves intransigent, he is quickly replaced by another officer of the same rank who kowtows to the party in power. Indeed, supervision in the name of democracy has eroded the foundations on which the criminal justice system rests.																								Not only in the selection of the chief of police, but also in the transfer and posting of all important police functionaries, there is now constant extraneous interference. This has encouraged the police personnel to believe that their career advancement does not depend on their professional performance but on being able to curry favour with politicians who matter. Politicking and hobnobbing with politicians have become important occupations for an average police officer. Needless to say, the chain of command and control has been severely weakened. Moreover, the nexus with politicians has eroded accountability and further encouraged corruption. The last is most worrisome because corruption in the police imperils the right to life and liberty of citizens and encourages criminality.																								To restore the credibility of the police, the national police commission recommended that the chief of police in a state has to be assured of a statutory tenure in office without the Damocles sword of transfer hanging over his head all the time. A secure tenure would strengthen his hands in the face of irregular pulls and pressures. The period of tenure would have to be included in specific provisions of the Police Act itself. The commission also recommended that the police chief be selected from a panel prepared by a committee headed by the chairman of the Union Public Service Commission and other members, including the chief secretary of the state and the existing police chief. The removal of the police chief before the expiry of his term would require the approval of the state security commission, an institution recommended by the national police commission to help the state government discharge its superintending responsibility in an open manner. However, these recommendations of the commission have been kept in the cold storage by both the Central and state governments. 																								The national police commission had also recommended that corrupt officers be weeded out by invoking Article 311(2)(c) of the Indian Constitution. Clause (c) in the article had to be amended to allow the president or the governor to take such summary measures in the interest not only of the security of the state but also maintenance of the integrity of people in public service.																								The problem of political interference in the working of the police is not only unique to India but is common to other democratic countries as well. The United States of America tried to deal with it by strengthening the position of police chiefs by giving them a reasonable tenure of office, by reducing political interference, and by laying emphasis on high admission standards. In the United Kingdom too, the need to prevent political patronage from affecting the performance of civil services was recognized by the creation of the Civil Services Commission in 1855. This established an independent civil service through open competition. It, however, took 15 years for political parties to relinquish the patronage they had enjoyed till then and agree to the new arrangement. 																								T he KNAPP Commission (1971), investigating police corruption in New York City, classified corrupt policemen into two categories  meat eaters and grass eaters. The meat eaters are policemen who aggressively misuse police powers for personal gain. The grass eaters accept the pay-offs that police work occasionally throws their way. Although the meat eaters get huge payoffs and make headlines, yet they represent a small percentage of corrupt policemen. Meat eaters however get a boost when they get a venal police chief who can exercise no control over them. They become exploitative and predatory to the extreme. 																								This is precisely what happened in Mumbai. Politicians in Maharashtra responsible for backing an unsuitable police chief have done a great disservice not only to the Mumbai police force but to the country as well. In an organization like the police where opportunities and temptations are many, the police chiefs have to be scrupulously fair and honest. To quote the veteran police, Patrick Murphy, except your pay cheque there is no such thing as a clean buck.																								So far, the SIT has done painstaking investigation and unravelled omissions and commissions of the commissioner of police and other police personnel who have amassed huge properties and shielded Abdul Karim Telgi and his gang. Internal investigation is however sometimes more useful because officers within the organization at times tend to close ranks and refuse to blow the whistle when investigation is being done by an outside agency. 																								The Telgi scam undoubtedly has other dimensions. It has inter-state ramifications and there is every likelihood that politicians who favoured Telgi also instructed police officers to shield him. It is doubtful how far the Central Bureau of Investigation will be able to carry on vigorous investigation against these bigwigs who operate from behind the scene. Whatever the fallout, the investigation has to be followed up by prosecution and deterrent punishment to the criminals and their patrons.

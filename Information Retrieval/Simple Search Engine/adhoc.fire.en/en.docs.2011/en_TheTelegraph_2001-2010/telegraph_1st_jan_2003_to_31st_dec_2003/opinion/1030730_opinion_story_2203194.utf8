The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 30, 2003  VIEWERS IN THE DARK
 - CAS is destined to make the cable industry more transparent  Abhirup sarkar The author is professor of economics,  Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta The conditional access system  has been shelved temporarily, but consumers in the four  metros, where the new system was supposed to be introduced  from mid-July, are not sure whether to feel relieved or  disappointed. The truth is that most viewers are still in  the dark as far as the details of the new system are concerned.  The government, especially the information and broadcasting  minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, on the other hand, considers  CAS as a definite means to please the consumers before the  elections next year. So much so that the government has  persuaded the provi- ders of cable services to conduct an  awareness campaign before the new system is introduced. How is CAS supposed to please  the consumers? Would it please all consumers or only a section  of them? More important, CAS entails the government to intervene  into the cable television market and bargain on behalf of  the consumers over the price to be paid by them to the service  providers. So, is it not a departure from the announced  policy of liberalization and non-intervention? Is the government  tampering with market forces to woo the voters on the eve  of an election? Or is the venture consistent with the governments  liberal policy stance? Indeed, one needs to answer these  questions for an understanding of the full implications  of CAS. Let us start with the demerits  of the present system which, presumably, has led the government  to look for an alternative. Under the present system, cable  service reaches the consumer only after it passes through  a number of intermediate stages. At the one end of the spectrum  there are the broadcasters who are basically the producers  of television services. At the other end lies the consumer.  In between various layers of middlemen, large, medium and  small, weak and powerful, crowd the market. Producers sell  their products to large distribution hubs called multi-system  operators.  The MSOs, in turn, sell the services  to local operators who finally sell the product to the consumers.  Over the last ten years or so, big producers have managed  to acquire stakes in MSOs indicating vertical integration  and to some extent concentration. The present system, nevertheless,  allows some market power to the small operator in the local  market he is serving. The local operator takes full advantage  of this. He is able to charge different prices in different  localities, with price going up as the degree of affluence  of the neighbourhood increases. Sometimes he would even  charge, albeit surreptitiously, different prices to different  households within the same neighbourhood. In other words,  he has the power to price discriminate and indeed he uses  this power to extract maximum rent from the consumers. There are, of course, scores of  markets where sellers enjoy market power. But surely we  do not observe price discrimination in all of them. One  wonders, what is so special about the market for cable services  which enables the seller to charge different prices to different  consumers? The secret lies in the word services. If for  any tangible commodity, different prices are charged in  different localities, it is natural for someone, looking  for an easy buck, to buy some goods in the cheaper market  and sell them for a profit in the market where price is  higher.  Clearly, this cannot continue  indefinitely, for the process of buying and selling would  tend to increase demand in the cheaper market and supply  in the dearer one. As a result, price will increase in the  former and decrease in the latter eventually equalizing  the two prices. But this process of arbitrage cannot work  for services simply because services, once bought, are not  resaleable. This explains why price discrimination is not  so rare in the market for cable services. What is wrong with price discrimination?  One may argue that if local price increases with the degree  of affluence of the neighbourhood, after all only consumers  with a greater ability are paying a higher price. It is  not a sound argument though. Not everyone in an affluent  locality is affluent. Neither is a person residing in a  less prosperous area necessarily poor. More important, price  discrimination gives the seller a powerful weapon with which  he can drain the consumer of his welfare. It is a raw deal  for the consumer and someone, like the government, must  do something about it. The other problem with the existing  system is that the consumer is compelled to buy an entire  package irrespective of his actual consumption. A consumer  has neither the talent nor the inclination to follow hundreds  of channels in 15 different languages. He would like to  watch programmes in two or three languages at the most.  But the present system does not allow him to buy selectively.  So a system should evolve where he has the option of not  paying for the channels he will never view. Finally, the present system deprives  the government of its legitimate tax revenue. At present,  neither the exact number of clients served by a local operator  nor the price appropriated by him is transparent. Consequently,  the government is in the dark as far as the tax base in  cable markets is concerned. Conditional access system is destined  to bring about transparency in the cable industry. The government  is sitting with the big players in the market, the broadcasters  and the MSOs, to settle a price or to be more precise, an  array of prices one for each package, which are to be uniformly  paid by all consumers. Evidently, this will rob the local  operator off his monopoly power and push him to the threshold  of mere subsistence. He will now work just as an agent of  a bigger player. One may expect an increase in the degree  of concentration in the market. One may also expect the  weeding out of price discrimination from the industry. Finally,  one may expect a better collection of tax revenue. All consumers will not gain uniformly  from the deal, some may even lose. Those who were paying  a lower than average price will face a price increase in  the new regime. Those who were paying high prices before  will definitely gain. Should we worry about the increase  in the degree of monopoly in the market? Should we worry  about the impoverishment of the local operators? Strictly  speaking we should not. A decrease in the number of players  in the market does not necessarily decrease the degree of  competition, particularly if the existing players are engaged  in fierce price competition. In the present situation, we  do not know whether the players are openly competing or  implicitly colluding. But we know for sure that the government  is intervening in the market. Assuming that it is primarily  concerned with the welfare of the consumers and not with  the profits of the service providers, we should expect that  this intervention will keep prices within limits. The marginalization  of the small operators will in fact benefit the consumers.  As long as the small operators  were enjoying some market power, consumers had to pay for  their profits as well as the profits of the large players.  With vertical integration and the small players becoming  a part of the large, total profits reaped by the sellers  taken together should fall and on this count consumers should  benefit. Finally, is government intervention in the cable  market justified? In markets for tangible commodities, if  the government tries to reduce the price artificially, it  acts like a disincentive to the producers who would typically  respond by reducing supply. This, in turn, tends to reduce  welfare. The cable television market, however, is different.  Here the main production cost is in the nature of a fixed  cost. Once this cost is incurred and the output is produced,  very little additional expenditure is involved in supplying  the product to an additional consumer.  Therefore, even if the government  artificially reduces the price, the supplier has little  incentive to reduce the number of clients to whom the service  is to be provided. This definitely establishes a case for  government intervention.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 GOOD FOR NOW
																								In a situation of deadlock, if one side seems to shift a little, something is changing. That is the most positive way that Mr Pervez Musharrafs suggestion can be viewed. He has said that Pakistans demand for a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir has been left aside. No one who is even slightly acquainted with the bitter history of India-Pakistan relations, with Jammu and Kashmir as the indigestible bone of contention, would believe that the Pakistani president has waved a magic wand. Mr Musharraf himself would probably be the last person to believe it. He and his men are already into logical and rhetorical acrobatics, offering palliatives to angry people at home and calming the militant groups. They have to prove that one, Mr Musharraf is being consistent  which means little, two, he is not suggesting a substitution of the Forties United Nations security council recommendation for a plebiscite, but has measures to make India look at the old idea in a new way, and three, left aside means something left undone, not forgotten.																								The truth or falsity of these statements is not the issue. It is a moment of delicate negotiation, more obviously for Pakistans president than for Indias prime minister. Seeking a quiet renewal of the Lahore declaration  which swore by the Shimla agreement with its proposal of bilateral talks or other peaceful means of settling pending disputes  cannot be easy. Nor would it have been undertaken without pressure. The pressures on Mr Musharraf are many. Pakistans stubborn demand for a plebiscite is undermining its credibility as an eager participant in dialogue with India in international eyes, especially since little has been achieved in reducing terrorism in the valley. Few now believe that Pakistan is innocent in that, and this, in turn, undermines its position as an ally in the coalition against terror. But that is not all. As he now is, a democratically elected president, Mr Musharraf needs to establish his credentials as a nation-leader anxious to improve the quality of his peoples lives. Improved trade relations with India and inter-nation travel facilities are surefire means of satisfying his businessmens growing desire for the opening up of economic possibilities. The logic of globalization makes this almost inevitable. A free trade bloc in the south Asian region has also become urgent  if China and India can manage their territorial differences, why cant Pakistan and India? To time the suggestion just before the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation meet in Islamabad is good strategy. Even a gauntlet. 																								Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee has already broached the idea of a common currency. Now let the world watch India top this one. If all this prolongs the ceasefire along the line of control, keeps the inter-nation bus and train running and allows children better medical care, it is good enough for the moment.

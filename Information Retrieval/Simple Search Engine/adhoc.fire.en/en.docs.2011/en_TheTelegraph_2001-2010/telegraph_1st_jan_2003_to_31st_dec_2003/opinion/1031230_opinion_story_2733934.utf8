 															- Document  From the Asian Centre for Human Rights  alternate report for the UN committee on the rights of the  child 				 	 First impressions																								Promotion of hatred through education in Gujarat: The books recommended by the Gujarat State Board of School Textbooks promote hatred. The text book for Social Studies for Class 9 students is a case in point.																								Chapter 9 of Social Studies is titled Problems of the Country and their Solution. The first section (problem) is minority community (P93). It states apart from the Muslims, even the Christians, Parsees and other foreigners are also recognized as the minority communities. In most of the states the Hindus are in a minority and Muslims, Christians and Sikhs are a majority in these respective states. Therefore, Class 9 children are taught that Muslims and Christians are foreigners and that Hindus are in a minority in most states.																								On Problems of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (P94) titled What ails them? it states, They have not been suitably placed in our social order, therefore, even after independence they are still backward and poor. Of course, their ignorance, illiteracy and blind faith are to be blamed for lack of progress because they still fail to realize importance of education in life. The message is clear, the scheduled castes and tribes have only themselves to blame for their sorry plight, and caste discrimination.																								The teaching in the schools in Gujarat is contrary to universal affirmation that all doctrines, policies and practices based on or advocating superiority of peoples or individuals on the basis of national origin, racial, religious, ethnic or cultural differences are racist, scientifically false, legally invalid, morally condemnable and socially unjust.																								The Class 12 students sitting for their board examinations in Gujarat on April 22, 2002 were put to a grammar test. The English paper asked them to remove the word if and rewrite the sentence, If you dont like people, kill them. This was followed by another question asking students to rewrite a short passage as a single sentence. The passage read:																								There are two solutions. One of them is the Nazi solution. If you dont like people, kill them, segregate them. Then strut up and down. Proclaim that you are the salt of the earth.																								Promotion of disrespect to the Sikh Guru, Govind Singh: The Central Board of Secondary Educations Class VI Hindi textbook uses disrespectful language against Guru Gobind Singh and publishing the Gurus sketch showing him brandishing a sword. The Khalsa Academy has written to the prime minister, the Union human resources development minister and members of Parliament pointing out the offensive portions and urging the withdrawal of the chapter...

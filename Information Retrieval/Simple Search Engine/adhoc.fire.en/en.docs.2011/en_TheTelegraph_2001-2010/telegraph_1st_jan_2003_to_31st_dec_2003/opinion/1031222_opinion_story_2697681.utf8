The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, December 22, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Method behind the madness				 																																																				Sir  With each passing day, the ghost of March 2002 seems to be catching up with Narendra Modi (British riot case notice to Gujarat, Dec 20). It is interesting that the petitioner in the case of the killing of British nationals during the Gujarat pogrom is a Muslim  Imran Mohammed Salim Dawood, a British national himself. The charges reveal again the precision of the plan that resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent Muslims post-February 28. The report does not mention the religious affiliations of the three British nationals who were killed, but it is quite certain that they were Muslims. And therefore, even if they were citizens of another country, they were to be wiped out for embracing Islam. But the frightening realization is that the killers had knowledge of the identity and nationality of the three  a fact which speaks of a sinister design of drawing up an accurate list of all Muslims in the state at that point of time. Can these ghosts ever be exorcised?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Gaurav Bhat, New Delhi
				 																Wizardry in Oz				 																																																				Sir  The euphoria generated by Indias win over Australia in the Adelaide test is certainly justified given that this comes 21 years after the last win Down Under. But this match also bore out the truth of the comments made by the former Pakistani captain, Imran Khan, that Sachin Tendulkar is not a matchwinning player. Even a Deep Dasgupta has helped India save a match against South Africa, but there are only a handful of tests which India has won riding only on Tendulkars shoulders. Do we need any more proof of that?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I think Team India has well and truly begun their journey to become the best test team in the world (God above Aussies under, Dec 17). India has done with a great deal of elan what every test-playing nation has been trying to do, and failing, in the recent past  beating Australia in Australia.				 																																																				But in our elation over Rahul Dravids innings, we should not forget the contributions of V.V.S. Laxman, Anil Kumble and of course, Ajit Agarkar. Sourav Ganguly also made an excellent move by bringing Sachin Tendulkar into the attack when Steve Waugh and Damien Martyn seemed to be steadying the Australian second innings. Had Tendulkar not scalped both in successive overs (not to forget Dravids brilliant first-slip catches in both cases), the story of the may just have been different. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rajarshi Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is not fair to cite the absence of Brett Lee, Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne to portray Indias win in Adelaide as a fluke, since India too missed the services of Jawagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh. Warnes record against India is anything but great. The fact remains that the Indians are a far more competitive and resilient team than the one that toured Australia four years ago. There is no other way but to accept this. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anagh Pal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The celebrations, both on the field and in India, after India won the test match against Australia in Adelaide were a little premature and well in excess. India have beaten Australia in India and at neutral venues many times in the recent past. Why should beating the Aussies in their own backyard suddenly become such an earth-shattering event? If beating Australia on their home ground is the yardstick of success, then the senior players of our team do not deserve the respect and fame they enjoy. Why should Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Anil Kumble be worshipped when they couldnt even beat Australia in Australia for so long? It is better to count the time between this win and our last over Australia, no matter what the venue. What is the use of belittling ourselves by giving Australians the tag of invincibles and basking in the glory of defeating them. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is important that the Indians do not become complacent after winning the second test against Australia. There are two more to go, and the Australians have showed several times in the past that they perform out of their skins when they are under pressure. India cannot afford to squander the opportunity they have got.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ankur Ghosh, Asansol

				 																																																				Sir  For those doomsayers and arm-chair pundits who had predicted a four-nil whitewash before the series, the Adelaide test is the correct reply. However, the win would have remained a dream without the determination and leadership of Sourav Ganguly. His intelligent moves continuing, India can clinch the rubber.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sundaresan Suresh, via email

				 																																																				Sir  Indias win in Adelaide seemed possible only after they scored 523 in reply to Australias first-innings score of 556. It is clear that even Steve Waugh did not expect India to nearly overtake their score. But it is equally true that no test match can be won unless a team takes 20 wickets, no matter how many runs they have scored. Therefore, though Rahul Dravid played two brilliant innings of 233 and 72 and was the official man of the match, India would have finished on the losing side without the performances of Anil Kumble in the first innings and Ajit Agarkar in the second (Sachin Tendulkar and Irfan Pathan too). We must start giving credit everywhere it is due.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sudeshna Guha, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Has Sachin Tendulkar saved his best for the last (two tests)? If so, then why are we worrying about winning the series?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.P. Shukla, Howrah

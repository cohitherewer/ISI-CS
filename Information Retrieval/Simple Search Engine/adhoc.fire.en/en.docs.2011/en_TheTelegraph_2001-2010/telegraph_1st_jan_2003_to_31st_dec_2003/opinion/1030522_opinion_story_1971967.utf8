 - There is talk of a road map for Kashmir since the Armitage  visit  V.R. Raghavan The author is former director general  military operations and currently director, Delhi Policy Group In less than a week after Richard  Armitage left India, Indian leadership is talking of a road  map being worked out for Jammu and Kashmir. As is normal  in New Delhi, two ministers have spoken of it and each has  added to the doubts and misgivings on the subject. Yashwant  Sinha first made a statement on the subject to be followed  by George Fernandes. One of them alluded to Indian and Pakistani  prime ministers speaking on the telephone about it. Both  ministers have reiterated the need for infiltration coming  down if talks have to commence between the two states. If  there is a road map, the prime minister in his dramatic  and emotional speech made in Parliament made no mention  of it. Is it a road map being drawn up unilaterally or in  consultation with Pervez Musharrafs government? What milestones  and alleyways could form part of it? Nothing has been said  of it. A road map being drawn up is indirect  admission of there being none available so far. It could  also mean that it has been necessitated by the insufficiency  or failure of previous plans on Jammu and Kashmir. A million-strong  military force of two countries stood facing each other  through most of 2002, daring each other to attack and talked  of nuclear weapons coming into use if the attack took place.  Will there be a military content to the new map being drawn  up? Is the new map unrelated to the Armitage visit or a  consequence of it? That the Bharatiya Janata Party-led  government is unwilling to risk a dialogue with Pakistan  is widely known. It cannot be seen to be making concessions  to Pakistan with elections to important states coming up  and a general election due next year. A government which  cannot sustain obvious economic measures like the introduction  of value-added tax, and new telephone tariffs with an eye  on the elections, can hardly be expected to take bold initiatives  on Kashmir. Its best bet lies in taking a hard and unyielding  position on Pakistan and dialogue with it. Any surprise  which the prime ministers Srinagar speech may have sprung  was therefore quickly dampened by well-choreographed conditionalities  and riders added to the prime ministers statement by officials. It seems that the Armitage visit  was taken by Pakistan and India as an opportunity to be  seen as cooperating with the superpower, even as neither  side had any intention to resile from hard positions. In  his visits to India and Pakistan during the military standoff  of 2001-02, Armitage had acted as the neutral intermediary.  He conveyed New Delhis seriousness for war if Pakistan  did not stop infiltration and terrorist actions in Islamabad.  He obtained promises on this from Musharraf himself, and  assured New Delhi of it being implemented. India has since  been holding the United States of America accountable on  Musharrafs promises being fulfilled. Vajpayee and senior  ministers have gone on record to express their disappointment  with the US for failing to get the promises fulfilled. This  time, both governments wanted to reiterate their stand to  the US, while sounding amen- able to suggestions of engaging  with each other. The US was obviously not amused  by the military stand-off of 2002. It is not willing to  keep rushing to the subcontinent every few months to cool  things down. Crisis-building by India and Pakistan to draw  in the major powers on the Kashmir issue, with the concurrent  risks of a military conflict, is now proving counter-productive.  The US after Iraq has enough on its hands in west Asia and  east Asia and does not view the cyclic risk-taking by New  Delhi and Islamabad with equanimity. It wants the two capitals  to get involved in a dialogue and that is the operative  phrase in US policy now. Knowing this pressure to start  a dialogue process going, the leadership on both sides of  the border made dramatic statements before Armitage arrived.  Vajpayee was willing to start the dialogue within a day  of terrorism coming to an end. Pakistan was willing to destroy  terrorist camps within a day of their being found. Pakistan  was as willing as India, and more, to start a dialogue.  After these announcements were made, both sides brought  out their bag of conditions. Pakistan said that it will  never give up on Kashmir, and India linked dialogue to terrorism  being ended. Armitage had the last say and left both governments  fuming. In the process, he also indicated a shift in Washingtons  position vis--vis both India and Pakistan. He has placed the onus of keeping  peace and starting the process of engagement on both India  and Pakistan. He has indicated that the US cannot be expected  to judge between the claims of New Delhi and Islamabad.  By asking India to be the judge of infiltration going down  or otherwise, he has shown that Musharrafs claims cannot  be brushed aside. By praising Vajpayees statesmanship,  he has indicated the need for the General to reciprocate.  US policy is thus being repositioned to be equidistant between  India and Pakistan. The hyphen that determines US approaches  to India and Pakistan is where it always was. Whether this  is a victory for India or Pakistan can be answered differently  by different people. It is clear, however, that both governments  will have to find ways to engage each other by means other  than military brinkmanship. What is the way forward through  the maze of political fears, unwillingness to find common  ground, and the temptation to take the military route to  solving the impasse? The best way ahead is to start a mechanism  for exchange of views on each others positions, prejudices  and possibilities for peace. It will not be dialogue in  the form of high political theatre, but a continuing and  serious mechanism of engagement getting into place. This  will lay the foundations for a dialogue much further in  time, when each understands the limits of the others capacity  to accommodate and concede. The dialogue, when it does occur,  will not also be a single event but a process, conducted  over time and through changing governments. The need, overwhelmingly, is for  a process that keeps moving, irrespective of setbacks and  disturbances from time to time. The process needs to be  free from the political need to respond to events like terrorist  attacks and other violent acts. The process should be underwritten  by a commitment from both sides to eliminate the causes  of the problem. Pakistan will need to demonstrate that it  is dismantling the jihadi-led terror network and  its support base. India would have to demonstrate that it  is willing to hear all shades of opinions in Jammu and Kashmir  and not break off the talks with Pakistan. A process of  engagement that is raised above the capacity of terrorist  groups to disrupt it, will provide the mechanism through  which India and Pakistan can work out a solution to their  conflicts. That will allow a viable route for a peaceful  future to emerge.

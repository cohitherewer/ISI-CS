		 Thursday, May 29, 2003  THE POWER OF ONE
 Any exercise of American power today  is held up to be per se moral, because it is directed  against what the US labels as evil, writes Rakhahari Chatterji The author is professor of political  science and dean, faculty of arts, University of Calcutta Yalta, 1945: when  the rest of the world mattered  The 21-day Iraq war brought no  surprise to anyone. But it did generate a lot of fear. For,  the Iraq war was not really about Iraq; it was about the  United States of America. When the US said that Saddam Husseins  dictatorship was odious to its democratic sensibilities,  or that it must liberate the Iraqis from Saddams tyranny  for it was the Americans compelling burden of duty to the  international community, it was really talking in the wilderness.  During the past 50 years what did the US leave undone to  promote dictatorships instead? It brought Ngo Dinh Diem  to power in South Vietnam and then agreed to his assassination  through a military conspiracy. It ended the benign and stable  rule of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, invaded Cambodia and turned  it into a killing field.  It conspired a coup in Chile to  violently remove a democratically elected president and  replaced him with the fascist General Auguste Pinochet.  It single-handedly destroyed all democratic possibilities  in Pakistan by allying with the Pakistani army and supporting  recurrent military regimes. It empowered terrorists and  fundamentalists in Afghanistan. It propelled Saddam Hussein  to launch a 10-year war against Iran  in which he used  poison gas against both soldiers and civilians  which had  just gone through a bitter anti-Shah (and by the same token,  anti-American as well) revolution.  Despite such unprincipled, illegal,  conspiratorial, coercive and perfidious international behaviour  of the US during the last 50 years, the world had retained  great respect for it. Rather than being the product of fear  of American power, the respect was partly the result of  common peoples increasing frustration with the operation  of the Soviet system. But more importantly and directly,  it was the product of the ordinary peoples keen observation  and forthright appreciation of how in the US, a largely  open and free society exists, how Americans can freely engage  in self-criticism and self-correction, how Americans have  accumulated great power and yet exercised it with great  restraint.  This understanding of the US has  been produced and sustained by the very humane and empathetic  images of its leaders like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,  Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and John F. Kennedy.  These leaders had committed mistakes, suffered from contradictions,  occasionally capitulated to powerful interests; yet, they  never flaunted American power on the face of others. Perhaps  one of the best examples of this is FDRs decision, despite  his great physical disability, to travel thousands of miles  to Teheran and Yalta during the course of World War II to  meet Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin when he could easily  ask them to come to Washington instead. Both the League  of Nations and the United Nations are the USs brainchildren.  The US had become the strongest power by the end of the  19th century. Its power was most decisively seen in World  War II. Yet, Roosevelt decided to create the UN as a mechanism  of multilateralism, and wilfully accepted restraints on  possible future exercise of American power in the interest  of world peace. When the Vietnam war ended, people  all over the world thought that through its mistakes America  had learnt a few lessons, the most important being perhaps  that an American government must not ignore public opinion  in America and that military power was not the best means  for expanding American influence. Surprisingly, during the  last 25 post-Vietnam war years, the US devoted a large amount  of its energy to create an unparalleled conventional military  power. By the next year, the US will spend as much money  for defence as the rest of the world put together by only  devoting 4 per cent of its gross domestic product. With  only 5 per cent of worlds population, it shares 43 per  cent of the worlds economic production. But its participation  in foreign aid is lowest among the rich nations. The Bush  regime has withdrawn the US from the protocol to combat  global warming, rejected its participation in an international  criminal court, scrapped the anti-ballistic missile treaty  with Russia, abandoned talks on inspection rules for biological  weapons, failed to support the comprehensive test ban treaty,  and insisted on violating World Trade Organization norms  unless they serve American economic interests.  During the post-war years, the  US exercise of coercive power, except for Vietnam, was generally  indirect and covert, through agencies indigenous to the  target countries. Alternatively, it had earned the approval  of the UN and hence could be masked as UN action. The Iraq  war represented a complete break with this past. It was  the USs way of declaring that it has complete liberty to  exercise its hegemonic power any way it likes.  An important contemporary realist  thinker, John J. Mearsheimer, has pointed out that American  thinking on politics deeply suffers from a moralist strain.  He quotes S.M. Lipset as saying, Americans are utopian  moralists who press hard to institutionalize virtue, to  destroy evil people and eliminate wicked institutions and  practices. This leads Americans to question the virtue  of political realism and balance of power thinking (which,  in principle, deny moral virtue to any particular state).  Yet, during the Cold War period and also earlier, the US  was, in practice, following a balance of power politics  as a prudent policy. As Mearsheimer says, Behind closed  doorsthe elites who make national security policy speak  mostly the language of power, not that of principle, and  the US acts in the international system according to the  dictates of realist logic. This created a gap in the US  between political rhetoric and political action. But now, as the post-Cold War  period is coming of age, Bush and his cohorts are trying  to create a new synthesis between rhetoric and action in  US foreign policy. With the collapse of the Soviet Union,  there is no longer any compelling need for practising realist  balance of power politics. On the other hand, through the  accumulation of enormous power during the last quarter century  the US has achieved an unchangeable preponderance of power.  The present US policy-makers have combined the fact of this  enormous power with the traditional moralist strain in American  thinking to produce an unseated doctrine of moralism of  American power and have started to speak in the language  of moral universalism. Its like saying any exercise of  American power is per se moral, because it is directed  against what America labels as evil.  This not only goes against the  core of realist thinking, but is a recipe of Nazism in international  politics. For this doctrine of moralism of American power  is based on the belief that American hegemony is best for  the world and therefore, America would brook no opposition  to it. In effect, the US would create and lead a world empire. What can the world do about it?  An open challenge to American power or any attempt to create  a new combination of powers to balance America will be nipped  in the bud through the application of raw military might  (even a war against France or Russia is no longer unthinkable).  The only strategy could be long-term, and Gandhian in spirit.  The first requirement is for people to realize that the  world is now divided into the US and the rest; what divides  the two is neither religion nor civilization, but imperialism.  The choice for the rest is either to succumb individually  or resist collectively. It is necessary to understand that  in this struggle, terrorism cannot be the means: it would  only strengthen the hegemony and divide the rest. The protests and peace movements  will have to continue, but these will not be adequate. Countries  as well as individuals will have to withdraw their cooperation  with the US. At the onset of Nazism in Europe, thousands  had flocked to the US, settled there and made America what  it is today. Now a counter-migration is necessary. To compensate  for non-cooperation with the US, new and alternative structures  of international cooperation will have to be built by the  rest. These strategies will be costly in economic terms,  at least in the early phases.  One thing needs to be remembered  here. Two-fifths of American citizens have already opted  for peace. There would be more. The world anti-imperialist  struggle must certainly look forward to them. These Americans  have a democratic and international responsibility to see  that their country does not come to be ruled by the enemies  of democracy.

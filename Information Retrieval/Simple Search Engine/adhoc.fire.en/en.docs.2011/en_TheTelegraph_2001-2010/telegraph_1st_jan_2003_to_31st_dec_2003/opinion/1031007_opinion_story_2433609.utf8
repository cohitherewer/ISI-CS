The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, October 07, 2003 				 SUBJECT TO A FEW CONSTRAINTS
 															- document Extracts from the speech of Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the 58th session of the United Nations general assembly, September 25, 2003 concluded				 	 Long road ahead																								When the cross-border terrorism stops or when we eradicate it  we can have a dialogue with Pakistan on the other issues between us. While on this subject, I would also like to point out to the president of Pakistan that he should not confuse the legitimate aspiration for equality of nations with outmoded concepts of military parity...																								We should be particularly concerned at the various recent revelations about clandestine transfers of weapons of mass destruction and their technologies. We face the frightening prospect of these weapons and technologies falling into the hands of terrorists. Surely something needs to be done about the helplessness of international regimes in preventing such transactions, which clearly threaten international security. The same regimes expend considerable energy in imposing a variety of discriminatory technology-denial restrictions on responsible states...																								Our preoccupation with terrorism should not dilute our commitment to tackle the non-military threats to human and international security. We have to sustain the fight against trafficking in narcotic drugs, human beings and small arms; the pandemic of HIV/AIDS; diseases like malaria and tuberculosis that grip developing countries and the degradation of our common environment. Food security, energy security and health security are important goals.																								The countries of the North and of the South  the developed, developing, and transition economies  must resume their dialogue to build a better world for the present and future generations...																								International economic relations continue to be characterized by inequities and inequalities. Globalization has helped sections of the international economy, including some developing countries. However, large communities have been left outside its pale. It has engendered economic crises and instability in several developing countries, which have sharply increased poverty...																								Poverty alleviation requires resources on a far greater scale than now available. Globalization itself constrains developing country governments in raising public resources for poverty alleviation. The promise of the climate change and biodiversity treaties to raise significant resources for investment and technology transfer is yet unrealized. The resources of multilateral and bilateral development agencies are limited by the failure of industrialized countries to enhance development budgets.																								Therefore, if the current regimes of globalization and sustainable development are to be expanded  or even to survive  they must be directly harnessed to provide the necessary resources for poverty alleviation...																								Developing countries need to coordinate their positions in international negotiations to promote the adoption of regimes, which would help poverty alleviation. The India-Brazil-South Africa dialogue forum, which was established earlier this year, is an effort in this direction...																								We in the developing countries do not have the luxury of time. Political compulsions force us to meet the aspirations of our people quickly even as we subject ourselves to newer and more rigid international standards and norms. We owe it to our future generations to make strong efforts to meet the millennium development goals. There is a mutuality of interest in this between the developed and the developing countries. Global interdependence today means that economic disasters in developing countries could create a backlash on developed countries. We hope the world will act in this spirit of enlightened self-interest. Thank you CONCLUDED

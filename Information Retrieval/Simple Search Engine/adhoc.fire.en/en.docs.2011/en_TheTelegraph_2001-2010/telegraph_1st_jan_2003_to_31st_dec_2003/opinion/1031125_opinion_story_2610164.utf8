The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, November 25, 2003  IN PRAISE OF RETICENCE
 - Honesty should not be confused with publicity  Pratap Bhanu Mehta The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University  The court order on Taslima Nasreens  Dwikhandita has prompted yet another discussion on  the relationship between the private and intimate with the  literary and the public. There is no doubt that there are  insufficient grounds for legal prohibitions on the book  and the state ought to be more wary in restricting freedom  of expression. But this paper (Nov 22) also sees this episode  as revealing something about our culture, our proclivity  to steer clear in public discourse of matters of a personal  and intimate nature. We lament the fact that our biographies  and autobiographies are not candid in matters of sexuality  and personal relationships as those in the West are. This  is attributed to a combination of dispositions: moral prudery  that makes us shrink from these subjects, hypocrisy that  prompts us to maintain a faade of a particular morality,  and moral immaturity that disables us from treating these  subjects with a degree of honesty.  All these dispositions are certainly  widespread and have grave consequences. They debilitate  intelligent public policy and often lead us to deny people  the full freedom to be who they are and who they want to  be. But the claim that there is something intrinsically  morally and aesthetically wrong in our reticence in these  matters is a little too quick. The charge of moral immaturity  sounds too much like colonial scholars lamenting that we  did not possess quite the sense of historical consciousness  they did. By defining us as lacking maturity, perhaps we  are missing out on the moral and aesthetic uses of reticence:  the deeper truth that might lie behind our reluctance to  publicly discuss intimate matters. Any personal or intimate relationship  that is valuable is premised on one profound sentiment.  You ought to treat that person, or even that valuable encounter,  as ends in themselves, not a means to something else. There  is a real danger that public discussion of these matters  risks doing just that. It makes a real relationship available  for vicarious consumption and speculation and risks diminishing  it. Two, any such account is often only from one particular  perspective. What did this relationship mean to the particular  person who happens to write about it? The very difficulty  of giving anything more than one perspective risks treating  others as instrumental: they cannot help but appear as instruments  of your life narrative. Three, why should we presume that  knowledge about others, especially in these matters, is  something a third person perspective can easily possess  or even grasp? There is something faintly ludicrous when  people try and explain why they fell in love or why they  fell out of it. This is not because things like love and  betrayal are ridiculous, but because, as Adam Smith wrote,  the imaginations of mankind, not having acquired that particular  turn cannot enter into them.  All the contingent features that  make a relationship what it is, the delicate capillaries  that sustain it, or the pressures that destroy it, are often  not even transparent to oneself. The presumption of making  it transparent, placing it in a narrative that gives it  its inner meaning is almost never easy. The risk of misdescription,  of misrecognition, should suggest a certain epistemological  modesty in these matters. To expose these is not always  tantamount to telling the truth about them; rather it increases  the probability of permanent misidentification. There is also something liberating  about this reticence. For all its faults, Indian politics  has not been held hostage to a prurient interest in the  lives of its public figures. We have many politicians who  live in unorthodox relationships or reportedly have many  proclivities. But it is ironic that our reticent culture  allows more political space to them than the supposedly  frank and open culture of the United States or Britain.  In some ways, it is precisely the reluctance to discuss  these matters in public that allows them the freedom to  be who they are in this respect.  It is one of the ironies of our  politics that supposedly orthodox parties like the Bharatiya  Janata Party and the Shiv Sena have found room for lifestyles  that in the West would have been considered a poster child  for liberation, whereas publicity only diminishes the freedom  of many Western politicians. Paradoxically, freedom in these  matters is possible only when these are considered irrelevant  for public life, and some degree of reticence can contribute  to a sense of their irrelevance. The gaze of publicity and  candour can, on the other hand, always trap you by marking  you out as one thing rather than another. Freedom has its  own uses for secrecy. The Telegraph editorial  invoked Augustine, Rousseau and Gandhi as three writers  who broke through the wall of reticence. But in a sense  these cases prove the point. What interested them and interests  us about their personal relationships was the fact that  they revealed something about the general human predicament:  in Augustines case the nature of sin, in Gandhis case,  desire and in Rousseaus case, a general sense of social  oppression. In some ways, in those three autobiographies,  the nature of these relationships is incidental to that  larger existential account. Short of those connections,  those relationships would be of little interest.  This is also true of Skidelskys  magnificent Keynes biography. But only writers with extraordinary  ability, or figures with a compelling existential story  to tell, can prevent the discussion of intimate matters  from descending into vicariousness. It is not clear that  those who demand candour are honest about their own motives  in wishing that other people be less reticent about their  lives. If we are truly interested in freedom why do we wish  to possess other peoples lives? Why do we presume that  we need to or can understand it as they would have done  so themselves? Or for those who choose to reveal all: are  they certain that they are not using other lives as mere  instruments of their own? It is fashionable to lament Nehrus  reticence. But those plain words To Kamala, who is no more  convey more feeling than any greater candour might have  done. It respects the integrity of its subject more than  any attempt to render his views of her transparent would  have done. The Telegraph editorials call for honesty  is well taken. Perhaps, just as Ashis Nandy has argued for  a revaluation of the value we place on history, we might  want to revalue reticence. It is perhaps more a sign of  our humility, epistemological modesty and deep regard for  valuing relationships in their own terms, that we do not  discuss them publicly too much, unless tied to some compelling  social purpose. Honesty may be the highest morality, but  honesty should not be confused with publicity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Doctoring the future				 																																																				Sir  The criteria for being the proud holder of a doctorate in Bihar is slightly different from elsewhere in the world. Rather than being adjudged on the basis of knowledge and intelligence, the degree here adorns those who are masters in politics and crime. Happily, Laloo Prasad Yadav, who is to be bestowed the honour by the Patna University, possesses the required qualities (Varsity high honour for Laloo, Dec 22). The Rashtriya Janata Dal leaders curriculum vitae boasts of numerous scandals, pending criminal cases and a host of other crimes. He has single-handedly turned the once prosperous state into a permanent fixture in the BIMARU category. He has taken advantage of Bihars poverty to proclaim himself as a champion of the poor. The decision of the university betrays a deeper conspiracy to politicize education in India. And with the likes of Dr Shahabuddin and Dr Munna Shukla to keep him company, education in Bihar is likely to see many brighter days in the future.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ashok Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																Brothers in arms				 																																																				Sir  For years now, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar have become sanctuaries for militant organizations that carry out their operations on Indian soil  like the United Liberation Front of Asom, the Kamtapur Liberation Organization, All Tripura Tigers Force, National Democratic Front of Boroland and others (Flush out signal to Dhaka, Dec 19). These outfits slip into India and target army convoys, oil installations, trains, and extort and kill innocent people. Most of them allegedly have direct links with the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan, which provides money, arms and propaganda material to lure the young. 				 																																																				India has tried repeatedly, though unsuccessfully, to plead with its neighbours to flush out these terrorists. Bhutan is the only one which has responded positively to such requests. Faced with lethal strikes by the Royal Bhutanese Army, which was reportedly supported by Indian logistics, the terrorists have either been killed or forced to surrender. 				 																																																				But the big question remains  Bangladesh, a country which has a government married to the hate-India campaign. There have been innumerable reports of ISI activities in Bangladesh and of how Pakistan is using Bangladesh to train and arm terrorists for anti-India activities. Naturally, Bangladesh has denied the allegations, although the evidence is often overwhelming. India will probably have to wait till Bangladesh reacts to the news in Bhutan. But given the relative quiet in Kashmir, it could also start its own operations against terrorists operating from Bangladesh. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Terrorists fighting the Bhutan government with their backs to the wall are accusing it of violating the Geneva Convention (Cornered rebels pick up bandh weapon, Dec 20). This appears ridiculous particularly since these militants paid no heed to human rights when they extorted, kidnapped and killed their civilian victims. These people, who have no respect for the lives of others and do not care for law and order, should be ruthlessly eradicated. They are nothing but pests to our orderly society. No mercy or remorse should be shown to them as they have not shown any mercy to others in the past.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  The ongoing operations in the insurgent camps within Bhutanese territory have resulted in the capture and surrender of a large number of militants. Within a short while, the second phase of this operation will start in our own country in various states of the North-east and West Bengal, accompanied by the most crucial phase of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation programmes so far have been more or less unsuccessful since most of the time these half-hearted measures meant nothing more than paying a cash prize to the surrendered militants. Boys, who had tasted the power of the bullet, were allowed to go scotfree and were even given cash to shape their own destinies. To the hoodlums this meant having the legitimacy to brandish their weapons publicly at the slightest pretext in order to assert their authority. 				 																																																				The people of Assam are fed up with such activities by their own youth. There has to be a proper rehabilitation programme with the respective state governments acting as the nodal agency together with non-governmental organizations. Creation of counter- insurgency outfits with these boys can be an option. However, giving them permanent employment will be even more helpful. Another thing. The governments at the Centre and the states have to make sure that they do not indulge in petty politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dwaipayan Bora, Duliajan, Assam

				 																																																				Sir  A tiny country like Bhutan has shown how it can free itself of militancy if it is determined to do so. Our leaders in Delhi should wake up and initiate similar measures. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Yaisana Luwang, Imphal

				 																																																				Sir  The report Flushout throws up trophy trio, shows how important it is for India to have the cooperation of its neighbours in controlling terrorism within the country. Nepal, Pakistan, Myanmar, Bhutan and Bangladesh are intrinsic to any counter-insurgency operation. Like Bhutan, which now realizes how the terrorists were sapping its own strength, Pakistan should also realize the dangers of its policy of promoting terrorism in India. The assassination attempt on Pervez Musharraf should have driven home the point. Unfortunately, the general does not wish to learn.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  The fact that a dead body draped in the tricolour was sent back to the Indo-Bhutanese border confirms that the Indian army has joined hands with its Bhutanese counterpart to stop the spread of militancy (Tricolour-draped body tells tale, Dec 19). This secret deal with Bhutan will go a long way to help India get rid of terrorism. However, it remains to be seen whether Bhutan continues to understand Indias concerns. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The recent operations of the Royal Bhutan Army shows Indias lackadaisical response to militancy. Bhutan has merely flushed out terrorists from its own soil. But given Indias soft approach to militancy in the North-east, it does not seem likely that it will be able to keep up the pressure of the insurgents fleeing Bhutan.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sohini Sen, Calcutta

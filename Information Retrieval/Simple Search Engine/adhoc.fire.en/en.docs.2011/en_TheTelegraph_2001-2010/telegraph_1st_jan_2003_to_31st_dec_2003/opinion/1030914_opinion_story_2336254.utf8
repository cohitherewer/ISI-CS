		 Sunday, September 14, 2003  WAUGH VERSUS TENDULKAR
 - Sachins Ferrari and Steves charities  RAMACHANDRA GUHA ramguha@vsnl.com 		 Spontaneously sincereThe Australian cricket captain,  Steven Waugh, is more than just a sportsman. His work for  disadvantaged children in Calcutta has already won him wide  renown. That city enjoys most favoured status with him,  but to show that he does not shun other parts of India,  Waugh was recently in Bangalore, promoting a new childrens  charity. I was lucky to be part of the crowd that heard  the athlete, Ashwini Nachappa, engage him in an hour-long  conversation. Listening to Waugh speak made me ask myself  the question  how does he compare with Sachin Tendulkar? Let us, first, put them together  side-by-side as batsmen. The Indian has much the wider range  of shots, and a greater ability to decimate bowling attacks.  Except for the pick-up sweep against slow bowlers, Waugh  is less daring  he plays few lofted drives, few pulls and  hooks, and absolutely no dabs past slip. An innings by him  is efficient but unmemorable. When he scores a hundred,  one remembers little of the specifics. With Tendulkar, on  the other hand, a big score is studded with jewels: the  imperious force past cover, the dazzling straight drive,  the cheeky late cut. Again, unlike Sachin, Waugh cannot  transform a match in a matter of minutes. One will never  see him hit four fours in a row. This means that he is,  on the whole, less effective as a one-day player. But what  Waugh lacks in strokemaking ability he makes up in temperament.  His record in a crisis is staggeringly good (For all the  matches that he has won for India, Sachin has yet to play  an innings the like of which Waugh played against South  Africa in the 1999 World Cup). Day in day out, and when we consider  both varieties of the game, I think our man must just get  the edge. He is what we like to call him, the greatest  batsman in the world today. If one has to pay to watch,  or choose a batsman to win a match, then it is better to  go with Tendulkar. Turn now to the other departments of  the game. Both Waugh and Tendulkar fancy themselves as bowlers,  and both have got key wickets at key moments. I guess, on  the whole, the Australian is slightly more effective in  this regard. And he is much the better fielder. As cricketers, then, there is  little to choose between Tendulkar and Waugh. Ones advantage  in batting is cancelled out by the others greater strengths  in bowling and fielding. For me, at least, captaincy does  not come into the equation at all. With McGrath and Lee  and Warne to bowl for him, with Hayden and Martyn to bat  for him, with Ponting and Mark Waugh to field for him, and  perhaps above all, with Adam Gilchrist to keep wickets and  pinch-hit for him, Sachin too would have beaten all sides  in the world. Consider them next as characters.  Both are fierce local patriots. Waugh plays as hard for  New South Wales as he does for Australia. And Tendulkars  roots in Bombay are deep and enduring. Who can forget the  double hundred he scored against Tamil Nadu in the Ranji  Trophy final a couple of years ago? When he played the shot  that got his side the crucial first innings lead, he pumped  the air in exultation, his gesture captured by a photograph  that told us that this meant as much to him as any of his  test and one-day hundreds. Both Waugh and Tendulkar are proud  of their city and state. But they are prouder still of their  country. Tendulkar is a deeply patriotic man. It is said  that when India loses he feels the pain more acutely than  anyone else. And Waughs love for his country is manifest  too. Indeed, he still wears the baggy green cap that was  awarded him when he was first capped for Australia. Come, finally, to the duo as global  citizens. Here one must concede that the Australian leaves  the competition trailing. Waughs work for the poor is spontaneously  sincere. Its origins lie in a note slipped under his hotel  room during the Calcutta test of 1998. Now foreign cricketers  in India are subject to all sorts of entreaties. However,  a look at this particular note convinced Waugh that it was  unlike all the rest. The letter asked for him to come and  see a shelter run for the homeless. He did, and what he  saw moved him enough to return at periodic intervals. Now  he has taken his campaign to other parts of India. Unusually  for a man in his position, he puts his money where his mouth  is. Fully 30 per cent of Waughs annual income goes towards  charity. Steve Waugh comes across as a  cricketer of great dignity and intelligence. In Bangalore,  he spoke knowledgeably about the history of cricket, respectfully  about his opponents (Curtly Ambrose and Sachin Tendulkar  were singled out for especial praise), and passionately  about the need to help the less fortunate. The only time  he did not persuade or charm was when commenting on sledging.  He claimed that the Australians were unfairly singled out  merely because they were world champions. He insisted that  they were no worse or no better than any other team. The  television cameras tell us otherwise. Viewed charitably,  this defence of his mates must have been a working out in  practice of the Churchillian dictum: one should never criticize  ones countrymen outside ones country. Perhaps in the privacy  of the dressing-room, Waugh does indeed teach Glenn McGrath  some three-and five-letter words. Waugh had come to Bangalore via  Calcutta and Kochi. His fund-raising trip coincided with  the huge fuss in the Indian papers about Sachin Tendulkars  Ferrari. The chain of ones thinking led inevitably to the  following comparison: one man gives away his surplus wealth  to charity, the other man seeks unwarranted favours from  the tax-man. Tendulkar was, without question, poorly advised  in the matter of the Ferrari  either he should not have  accepted the car, or voluntarily paid the duty. Still, his  behaviour in this regard is not exceptional. What is  exceptional is Waughs work for the poor. In this respect  he stands out, not only in comparison with Tendulkar, but  also with regard to the overwhelming majority of modern  sportsmen. He has done what Don Bradman and Sunil Gavaskar,  as well as Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, could not bring  themselves to do. Speaking in Bangalore, Waugh generously  acknowledged that Tendulkar will break any cricketing records  he might himself set. His own career will carry on, the  normally unsentimental Australian selectors permitting,  until the tour of India next year. If Waugh is chosen for  that series, it will mark the final clash between two of  the greatest cricketers to have graced the game. Waugh versus Tendulkar is a  nice title for an article, and a nicer one for a book. Perhaps  a writer with greater energy and enterprise shall attempt  just such a study. This might begin with the cricketing  traditions of Sydney and Bombay, and move on via  the respective national histories to a careful consideration  of the two cricketers as batsmen and team-men. The book  will naturally end with the India-Australia test series  of 2004. But somewhere in the middle of the cricketing chapters  there has to be a chapter analysing, or pschyoanalysing,  the human beings behind and beyond the players. Why does  Waugh care so much for the poor? Is there a mid-life crisis  at work here, or a previously submerged Christian conscience?  One would love to know.

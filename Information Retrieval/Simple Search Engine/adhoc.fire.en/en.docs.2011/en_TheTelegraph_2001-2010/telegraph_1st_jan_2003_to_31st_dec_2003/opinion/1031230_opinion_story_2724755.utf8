The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																No one cares for the general				 																																																				Sir  Pervez Musharraf seems to be stuck between the proverbial devil and the deep sea. Sustained American pressure has forced him to turn Pakistans Kashmir policy on its head. Now the unhappy mullahs are literally gunning for him. There is no guarantee that all future assassination attempts on him will remain as unsuccessful as the first two. Musharrafs predicament does justice to the adage, one sows as one reaps. The jihadis he funded have turned out to be monsters, baying for their masters blood. The Americans, flush with their success in Iraq, have no reason to mollycoddle him. Naturally, they have suddenly become very perceptive to their allys carefully-crafted lies about fighting global terror. On the other side of the border, there is a rock-solid Indian government, steady in its diplomatic onslaught. The past is catching up with the general. Lets see if he has any remaining trump cards to save his life. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Ramesh Bhattacharjee, Calcutta
				 																A journey through hell				 																																																				Sir  The theatre troupe from Jammu, Natrang, should be lauded for performing at the national theatre festival despite the ordeal faced by its members on the Himgiri Express ( Terror on rails at Patna, Dec 25).The incident paints a very bad picture of Bihar, which always grabs the headlines for the wrong reasons  corruption, crime against women and poor law and order situation. The fact that a lady police constable pleaded helplessness on account of the fact that the hooligans were Laloos men, points out that the followers of Laloo Prasad Yadav can get away with anything. Being a woman herself, the chief minister, Rabri Devi, should take effective steps to stop such assaults on women from recurring. Those responsible for this particular incident must be hauled up and severely punished. As for the common man, he seems to have little hope of getting justice in Bihar.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The recent assault on Natrang proves what a nightmare it is to travel through Bihar. Unruly elements enter railway compartments at will, and do anything during the journey through the state. Women passengers are most vulnerable to such attacks. The guards look the other way as the vandals claim immunity on account of their relation or connection with political leaders. The top priority of the railways minister, Nitish Kumar, should be to ensure that trains are made Bihar-safe. Since it is difficult to prescribe how this should be done, the Union government should consider handing over the security to the army for this entire corridor through which the long-distance trains run.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Police and ticket-checkers are of no help to railway passengers in Bihar. Sometimes, they seem to be in cohorts with the people who forcefully enter reserved compartments, block seats and disturb passengers when the trains ply through Bihar. Their prime target seems to be young women. If anyone protests or requests them to stop the harassment, they are physically assaulted. 				 																																																				If the authorities do not take any steps to stop such incidents, people from other states, particularly those subject to harassment, might take the law into their own hands. Then innocent Biharis will be targeted. Hopefully, the Rabri Devi regime has not forgotten the recent incidents in Assam and Mumbai. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jayanta Chatterjee, Sainthia, Birbhum

				 																																																				Sir  The report, Terror on rails at Patna, proves that the government of Bihar is incapable of protecting the lives and properties of citizens. On the contrary, it seems that the criminals are operating under its tutelage. The Centre should dismiss the Rabri Devi regime and impose presidents rule in Bihar. Let us hope that the opposition does not prove to be a stumbling block this time.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The assault brings to mind an incident that occurred 30 years ago. I was travelling to Buxar, and as soon as our train stopped at a station near my destination, a group of people got into our compartment and forcibly occupied the reserved seats .When the passengers protested, they started using foul language. Later, when I recounted the incident, I was told You know, Bihar is the land of Taraka, Subahu, and Trijata. Ram killed the main ones, but the remaining lived there and prospered. You cannot expect anything better from them. This seems to be true. One should avoid Bihar if one can. So the sensible are fleeing the state.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
I.R. Sharma, Noida

				 																																																				Sir  Incidents such as the harassment of railway passengers is a common occurrence on Indian Railways and takes place anywhere in the country where there are hooligans. Why is Bihar being made the scapegoat for anything that goes wrong with rail travel?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Jadav, Patna

				 																																																				Sir  A gentleman, profusely bleeding from his forehead and eyes full of disgust, was brought to me for treatment. At first he tried to evade all inquiries about his injury, but later broke down, cursing his own destiny. From his story, I gathered that he was born and brought up in Assam, but his forefathers hailed from Bihar. This man had educated his children and grandchildren in local schools, one of them had even married an Assamese.Yet his family had been attacked by a group of masked young boys on the instigation of a student leader. 				 																																																				This man was asked to leave his locality. But where will he go after having severed his ties with Bihar for ages? Incidents like these are becoming more and more frequent in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and other parts of the country. But why is this happening at all? Why are we forgetting the contribution of these settlers, whether in Bihar or in Assam or anywhere else in the country? The media is not helping the situation either. As regards politicians, the less said the better. Let me repeat, the only outcome from this hatred and violence can be more violence and destruction. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R.P. Singh, Jorhat

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  Both The Telegraph and The Telegraph in Schools are very interesting. However, the television guide printed in the former is often wrong. The issue on December 28, for example, announced that the serial, Jhoot Boley Kauwa Kate, would be aired on Zee TV at 10 am. However, another serial by the name Jeena Isi ka Naam Hai was aired at that time. Such errors should not be allowed to recur.

 THIS ABOVE ALL KHUSHWANT SINGH				 	 Power of the pen																								Wherever an author or his book makes front pages of journals, I make it a point to read his works. Also when anyone gets the Pulitzer, Booker or the Novel Prize, I ring up my favourite bookstore and ask for their work. It is a reasonably safe way of finding something worth reading. That is how I came to read J.M. Coetzees novel, Disgrace, five years ago when it won the Booker Prize in 1999. A month ago, when Coetzee was named winner of the Nobel Prize for literature, I recalled his name but remembered nothing about his novel. So I got a second copy of Disgrace.																								How stupid of me, I said to myself as I read the first few pages, How can anyone forget a novel which opens with the main character, a professor of English literature in Cape Town University, twice divorced, consorting with an Indian woman who prostitutes herself once a week to keep her home and two children in reasonable comfort? That part came back to my mind, but the rest still eluded my memory. So the second time I read it to the end. And enjoyed it thoroughly.																								Professor David Lurie aged 52 is a compulsive womanizer. His special subject is Lord Byrons last years in Italy. And like Byron, he takes his women as they come, young and middle-aged, pretty nymphets as well as plain Janes. When Soraya, his once-a-week whore calls off the deal, he turns his attention to a 19-year-old student, Melanie Issacs. In any university, if a professor is found seducing one of his students, he brings serious trouble on his head. Lurie is forced to resign his job, he knows no college will accept him as a teacher. Local newspapers have exposed his affair on their front pages. He has become an outcaste in South Africas white society. He flees to Lucy, his daughter from his first wife who is farming a few acres of land upcountry next to a black African farmer, Petrus, a good neighbour who helps Lucy market her flowers and vegetables and keeps her farm production in the hope that one day he will be able to take it over with or without Lucy. He already has a black wife and mistress; the addition of Lucy would make a nice mnage  trois. Professor Luries arrival on the scene upsets Petruss applecart. He waits for Lurie to leave. But the professor has dug his heels in helping his daughter on the farm and looking after dogs she keeps for other people while they are on vacation. He also does voluntary work in a pet clinic some distance away, where a white woman treats sick animals and puts those beyond healing to sleep. Shes a married woman and physically not very appetising. Nevertheless, after they have finished with the animals, they treat each other on the floor of the clinic.																								One evening, when Lurie and daughter are taking the dogs for an airing, they pass those young blacks on the way. By the time they get back, the blacks have ransacked their house. They lock the professor in the lavatory, douse him with oil and set him alight. They take turns to rape Lucy; they shoot the dogs. And decamp. Lurie survives his ordeal with his head-hair singed and a black eye. So does the gang-raped Lucy. They report to the police omitting any reference to the rape. The police file a report. Nothing happens.																								A few days later, Petrus throws a large party to which he invites the professor and his daughter. Among the guests they spot one of the young blacks who had raped Lucy. His name is Pollux and he is related to Petrus through his wife. They confront Petrus and Pollux. Both were involved in the crime. Should they tell the police they have located the culprits? The professor is livid and wants the police to arrest Pollux. His daughter prevents him from doing so. She is pregnant. She means to stay in South Africa on whatever terms she can get  even as Petruss concubine and mother of a half-black, half-white bastard child. Her father returns to Cape Town and finds another prostitute to comfort him.																								There is a lot more to Coetzees novel than the story I have outlined. It conveys the stark reality of a colony once ruled by Dutch and English settlers and now under its original inhabitants  from Botha, Smits to Nelson Mandela and his black countrymen. I have not read anything as powerful and pregnant with meaning.																								A fortress too dry																								The trouble with the desire to get to ones destination as fast as possible often deprives us of the pleasure of seeing places which lie short distances from our set routes. I have travelled by the Grand Trunk Road scores of times and often wanted to stop at scenic villages, temples, dargahs, gurdwaras and forts on hill tops and find out something about them. But the hurry to get to Kasauli, Shimla or back to Delhi was so great that I never did so. I had heard of the 350-year old Chandela Rajput fort at Ramgarh, a bare seven kilometres off the main road from Panchkula, next door to Chandigarh, but never visited it. I will now see it since it has been converted into a heritage hotel with modern amenities including an indoor bathing pool and a health club with a masseur from Kerala. 																								The fort has some unique features, like 18-feet thick walls and an entrance gate 37 feet high, the highest doorway in the world. It also preserves its old Rajput style decor with lavish use of coloured glass to liven up its rooms and dining hall. I am not sure if I will spend a night there: the food served is strictly vegetarian; I have no objection to that. But it is also strictly teetotal. If a thirsty traveller arriving there on a hot summer afternoon is to cool himself with a tumbler of iced nimboopani or a tankard of chilled beer, most males would opt for the latter. And after a swim in the pool when you sit on its spacious lawns and let the evening air cool you, many customers would like a tot of whiskey on the rocks rather than a cup of garam chai. I dont know how a hotel can run without a liquor licence. Ramgarh Fort may show that it can be done.																								Six blind men and an elephant																								Once upon a time there were six blind men/ Who went to see an elephant inside its pen/ They first felt its legs, straight and stout/ Its like a big tree that can move about/ The second touched its trunk, felt it shake/ The elephant, he said, is just like a snake/ The third touched its tusk, curved and broad/ This animal, he claimed, must be like a sword/ The fourth reached its ears, floppy and flat/ Its a big hand-fan, nothing more than that/ The fifth, at the rear, got hold of its tail/ It resembles a broom, hung up on a nail/ The sixth said, I have solved the mystery/ Its called Jumbo, so it must be a ministry.

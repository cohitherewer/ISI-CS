This critical waterdevelopment process is often treated as an add-on to programmes, with scant regard to local capacity-building institutions, or to long-term commitment. Capacity building is a process that must be sustained and financed for the long-term and undertaken in a holistic and integrated manner and therefore a new global strategy for capacity building needs to be developed...

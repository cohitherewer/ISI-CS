 - The ASI report on Ayodhya negates one of the constitutive  principles of archaeology  Tapati Guha-Thakurta The author is professor of history,  Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta The protests had rung out more  than a decade ago. Ever since the miraculous archaeological  discoveries of S.P. Gupta and B.B. Lal of 1990 armed the  Vishwa Hindu Parishad with its most powerful body of evidence  about the remains of a Hindu temple beneath the Babri Masjid,  professional historians and archaeologists have cried themselves  hoarse over the flagrant abuse of their disciplines at Ayodhya.  The very form of the presentation of the Ramjanmabhumi demand,  as a historically testifiable thesis, made proof a central  issue in the controversy  the key endangered element, to  be saved and retrieved. D. Mandals tract, Ayodhya: Archaeology  After Demolition (1993), stands to date as the most  convincing challenge to the temple evidence. Mandal, a  field archaeologist, exposed the complete violation of the  science of stratigraphy in the digging of trenches and in  the analysis of the excavated artifacts at Ayodhya. He showed  how the random mixing of post-depositional debris with properly  stratified finds and a confusion of artifactual sequences  automatically denuded this entire corpus of material  of any status as data. If there was one fundamental point  that emerged from this archaeological debate of the early  Nineties, it was the impossibility of anything like incontrovertible  evidence in archaeology; also, the impossibility of unearthing  clues about any single or distinct pre-mosque structure  beneath the layers of debris of the demolished masjid  at the site. That this point has been of no import at all  is today up for all to see.  But what comes as a real eye-opener  is the way the science and the profession of archaeology  have once again allowed themselves to be dragged into the  renewed farce of providing hard proof that a 10th or 11th  Hindu temple existed immediately beneath the floor levels  of the demolished mosque. That such scientific and indisputable  evidence should now come after five months of excavation  by the Archaeological Survey of India and in the form of  a 574 page report submitted to the Allahabad High Court  on August 22, 2003, comes as the greatest irony. It finally  drives home the utter futility of all the scholarly criticisms  and exhortations of the past two decades, and its invocation  of objective knowledge.  Truth and facts died an ignoble  death at Ayodhya long ago. Yet, the search for newer and  newer evidence continues to drive the politics of the  site. Thus new scientific facts about a sprawling multi-pillared  temple structure beneath the Babri site can still be nonchalantly  offered by a professional body like the ASI, to a gullible  public and a jubilant Hindu right-wing, to be used as the  best moral tool to disinherit the Sunni Waqf board of its  rightful proprietorship of the land. And a clearly political  agenda of a hunt for an imaginary temple can take on the  scientific trappings of an excavation and a voluminous site  report, this time with a token adherence to the tenets of  stratigraphy. This hot document, the ASI report,  apparently in the public domain, remains tantalizingly out  of reach. So, we are up to our ears with the latest reports  on the proof of a massive 50x30 metre walled structure  just beneath the surface mosque floor, of some 50 pillar  bases that stand in full alignment with this structure,  of terracotta figurines, lotus motif carvings and  fragments of an amalaka, and most tellingly, of a  circular sanctum-like depression at the centre of the disputed  site, just beneath the make-shift shrine of Ram Lalla. The media has also picked up the  barrage of criticisms against these findings, brought up  by the team of independent archaeological observers like  Suraj Bhan, R.C. Thakran, Supriya Verma, Mohammed Abid and  Irfan Habib. We are told of their counter-readings of the  excavated mound as a rich habitation rather than a religious  site till possibly the early medieval period, and of the  existence thereafter of a distinctly Islamic structure of  the early Sultanate period, as indicated most clearly by  the presence of the lime-surkhi floor (a technique  brought in by Muslim builders) and vast deposits of glazed  tile ware.  If this ancient city site has  yielded important evidence of settlements from the Northern  Black Polished Ware and later Kushana and Gupta era, its  richest archeological data pertain nonetheless to this early  medieval Sultanate period. And these archaeologists have  stuck out their necks to argue that if anything was razed,  expanded and appropriated in the building of the Babri Masjid,  it was a prior mosque structure. These finds, they allege,  have been deliberately suppressed or distorted in the ASI  report in its determination to discover only a destroyed  temple at the site.  The quest for infallible underground  evidence has only ended in a mammoth spectre of public misinformation.  The independent or Left professionals, who were mobilized  as representatives of the Sunni Waqf board and the all-India  Muslim personal law board to adjudicate on the correctness  and scientificity of the excavations at Ayodhya are now  left in the greatest bind. They have on them the terrible  onus of having to fight the proof of temple remains with  an armoury of counter-proof or lack of proof. The kind of faith that the Muslim  parties have vested in the truth and objectivity of archaeological  evidence is quite pathetic. They have thus allowed themselves  to dance to the tune of the VHP; they were persuaded by  leaders like Zafrayab Jeelani to agree to the digging of  the Muslim graveyard site in the precincts even as excavation  was disallowed beneath the crucial spot of the makeshift  Ram shrine; and they have depended on the intervening powers  of this team of selected archaeologists to set the facts  right in their favour.  Throughout the months of the excavation,  these visiting archaeologists had been continually handing  in to the Allahabad court their observations and objections  (including their objections to what they were not allowed  to see or handle). Now they are faced with the unenviable  responsibility of having to supplant the volume and intricacies  of the ASI report at court with an equally formidable counter-document  that can prove the falsities and fabrications of this excavation  data. More than at any other time, the  public today is in dire need of being informed about the  basics of standard excavation procedure, about the norms  of digging, classifying and reporting, and about the regularity  with which artifacts like terracotta statues, pottery, tiles  or architectural carvings crop up in all such multi-cultural  structural mounds, without begetting any conclusions about  the existence of either temples or mosques. Only then would  the aberrations in what occurred at Ayodhya from the middle  of March this year be clear.  Why, we must ask, were trenches  laid out only in accordance with the highly questionable  Indo-Japanese ground penetrating radar survey? Why was the  crucial epicentre of the site occupied by the Ram shrine  left undisturbed, with worship continuing in the midst of  an excavated site? Why were trenches dug with little consideration  for natural lighting, with pink and saffron shamianas  further blocking out that light? One could well say that  a temple had been found here, even as the excavation began,  well before any report was submitted. A temple was the only  demand at the site  from everyone, whether they be sadhus,  security personnel or court officials.  A renowned archaeologist has applauded  the fact that, for the first time in Indian history, a full  excavation has been conducted under the control of the judiciary,  pushing the ASI into submitting this more-and-more rare  product of a site report. But what credibility rests today  with a body that has allowed its professional practice to  be dictated by the archaeological illiteracy of political  parties and the court, that could be jolted out of its notorious  inertia about completing and publishing reports only under  the political stranglehold of staging a made-to-order dig  and a trussed-up report?  But there is of course a much  larger accusation to be made here about the politics of  archaeology at Ayodhya. To have permitted itself to be embroiled  in this pointless exercise of authentication and refutation  of underground evidence has been, in my opinion, the greatest  undoing of the discipline. After all, what difference does  it make even if temple remains do exist at the site, even  if one assumes that portions of a temple were razed and  assimilated within the medieval mosque?  This basic point needed to be  made, and made most forcefully, by historians and archaeologists.  As lawyers are pointing out, proof of a prior temple cannot  alter the terms of the property dispute: it cannot take  away the hard fact testified by revenue records that for  centuries now, this mosque site was a waqf property.  More important, the past crime of the destruction of a  10th-century temple by Baburs general, Mir Baqi, cannot  by any means justify the far-greater modern-day crime of  the razing of a 16th-century mosque.  For that negates one of archaeologys  fundamental constitutive principles  the protection and  conservation of historical monuments, established through  a series of statutes in colonial and independent India.  It goes against the grain of all its intricate knowledges  of several other such temple-remains beneath mosques or  vestiges of Buddhist and Jain establishments beneath Hindu  religious edifices throughout India. It renders illegitimate,  by the same logic (say the logic of appropriating a Buddhist  site), several of the countrys most revered temples in  the custody of the ASI. Historical retribution and repossession  becomes the most dangerous of arguments for the countrys  vast architectural inheritance. If there was a single secular  principle that the government and the archaeological profession  should have established at Ayodhya, it was that the Babri  Masjid had to be protected as a historical structure. The  progressive infiltration of the mosque since its first forcible  occupation by the Bairagis sadhus of the Hanumangarhi  temple in the 1850s  from the construction of the Ram Chabutra  within the compound to entry of idols, pujaris and  worshippers  have underlined the urgency of this need for  over a century now.  There were many critical moments  when such a law could and should have intervened  when,  for instance, during the communal riots at Ayodhya in 1934,  one of the domes of the masjid was destroyed and had to  be renovated by the government; or when on the night of  December 22-23, 1949, the Ram idols were planted inside  and the property had to be locked and attached by court  order; or even as late as the Eighties when, following the  opening of the locks, the unrestricted access of Hindu  worshippers and the sangh parivars mounting Ramjanmabhoomi  campaign made the destruction of the mosque an imminent  danger. The disputed property needed to be more categorically  claimed as an archaeological protected monument.  To have failed in this cardinal  task, and then to have entered the battle for proof and  counter-proof about the historicity of the site as Ramjanmabhoomi  and the presence of the conjectured temple, were to have  given the game over fully to the masters of Hindutva.  There is little left to be salvaged now. Having first lost  portions of the courtyard, then the rights of worship and  eventually the entire masjid, the Muslim litigants are fast  on the path of forfeiting their last rights on the property.  To hope that the rule of law can still prevail to retain  for the disinherited this symbolic land, or to ask that  this emptied excavated mound be now preserved as a prime  ancient and medieval archaeological site is like crying  in the dark.

				 																																																																														 Beaten hollow, then shamed, and then made to return from a famous birthday with a bouquet undelivered, Ajit Jogi, however, does not betray any traits that would mark him as a man defeated back home in Chhattisgarh. Opportunist to the core, the former civil servant is busy rearranging his cards and contacts. One of these deft manoeuvres has taken him back to his former mentor and political guru, Arjun Singh, a man he had had no qualms about abandoning during his days in the sun. And a man who, given his grudge against the occupant of 10, Janpath, could be of invaluable assistance to a humiliated Jogi. Singh, unfortunately, is also a man who would never let such an occasion go lightly. Singh to Jogi, To aapko hamari yaad aa hi gayee (So, you managed to remember me, after all). A sheepish Jogi, naturally, refuted Singh, reminding him how he had always considered himself to be Singhs protg. It is not known if the Congress veteran bought Jogis lie, but the guru is believed to have advised the chela to lie low for a while, and wait for his turn to strike. Just the way Arjun himself is doing?				 																																																																														 Before the jubilation over the India win against the Aussies dies down, it is wise to remind people of one quaint whisper doing the rounds in the central hall of Parliament. Our legislators have found a strange likeness between Mr Dependable, Rahul Dravid, and the deputy prime minister. Sample this. Dravid has been tried at all levels in the team  as opener, one down, middle order, wicket-keeper, part-time captain, and has even been asked to stay out to give youngsters a chance. Having proved his mettle, Dravid continues to be number two. Does it ring a bell now? No? Then think of LK Advani, the chief architect of BJP victory, the man-in-charge of home, Kashmir, Ayodhya, the party and so on, and who continues to be number two. Got it?				 																																																																														 Old habits die hard. A woman learning it the hard way is the new CM of Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharti. At the state assembly recently, Bharti was heard addressing Digvijay Singh as Manya mukhya mantri (honourable chief minister). Realizing the gaffe, Bharti went on without batting an eyelid, I know that I have made a mistake. But the whole state and everyone present here know who is what. Do they really?				 																																																																														 The maharaja in Punjab, Amarinder Singh, continues to be in a spot and continues to suspect that a powerful AICC lobby is hellbent on ousting him. As usual, a plebeian in the AICC headquarters has had to take the blame. Ahmad Patel, Sonias political secretary, apparently has a daughter married to the son of the Punjab director general in police. The police officer is supposedly having problems with the home secretary, who in turn happens to be a blue-eyed boy of Amarinder. At another level, the lone Muslim MLA, Razia Sultana, is believed to be losing patience waiting to be minister. Her husband, also a senior police officer, is reportedly close to the same AICC functionary  Patel. 				 																																													For now, there has been a truce of some kind in Punjab which has seen the exit of two Amarinder favourites. The chief minister is hoping that madam on her part also plays fair and keeps Patel out of his hair, or is it beard? 				 																																																																														 Yojna Bhawan, which houses the planning commission known for preaching austerity, is rapidly undergoing a metamorphosis under the new incumbent, Rajiv Ratan Shah, who is turning out to be extremely demanding. Falling in line with Shah, the commission is reported to have disposed of its good old ambassador used by the former secretaries for a new-age Esteem. A plasma television has replaced the ordinary TV inside. The commission, naturally, has had to find other ways of compensating for the expenditure, one of which is by disconnecting the high-speed servers used by its researchers. No loss, no gain?				 																																																																														 Theres supposed to be a woman behind every successful man, is it also true the other way round? May be. For it might be difficult to write off K Govindacharyas contribution to Uma Bhartis victory in the Madhya Pradesh assembly elections entirely. The once famous RSS pracharak had been camping in the state for the past several months and working overtime, particularly in the Maha Kaushal and Vindhya region, to ensure the lady won. Devotion?				 																																																																														 Sachin Tendulkar seems to be getting steadily more worried about his post-retirement days. He, together with his business partner, is planning another eatery at Mulund. Better luck this time!				 																																																																														 The long wait for a portfolio might soon be over for didi, given that a truant Vikram Verma, minister for youth affairs and sports, seems destined to lose his portfolio for refusing to pay obeisance to Uma Bharti. Meanwhile, Mamata is not wasting time. Ever more conscious of her loosening grip over Bengal, didis kitchen cabinet is sending steady feelers to Tapan Sikdar, the has-been BJP chief in the state. But why Tapan? That is because Sikdar has given the Trinamool-BJP combine hard victories before, and the present chief, Tathagata Ray, is still untested in matters as serious as a general election. The bridge-building with the BJP, and with Sikdar especially, becomes important given the growing proximity between Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and LK Advani and the approaching elections which would stretch the Trinamool kitty beyond its means. Which probably explains the Trinamool teams alacrity to get things going. The famous meeting has been scheduled in Delhi, although the venue and the time is yet to be fixed. If the cats stop fighting, the rats better watch out!

 - A jolly Christian youth in Bengal takes on Rama and his  rabble  Telling Tales / AMIT CHAUDHURI Poles of recovery When I was an undergraduate at  University College, London, in the early Eighties, cultivating  a life of self-imposed loneliness, I would be pursued by  a man of indeterminate nationality. He could have been from  Latin America; when I asked him where he came from, he replied  with a snort, Let us sayfrom one of the industrialized  nations. His interest in me wasnt amorous; his intention  was, curiously  once hed found out I was from India   to humiliate me in the way Ive just mentioned.  I think he was lonelier than I  was; bearded, overcoated, his face raw with a skin disorder  and his eyes framed by thick glasses, he had the air of  a graduate student whose project had gone nowhere. He lighted  upon me on the steps of Senate House or the Students Union  Building, or on one of the roads outside. It was in front  of the Dillons Bookshop that he asked me (hed obviously  discovered I was a student of English, and that I had ambitions  as a writer, though I cant recall when I divulged this  information to him) a question that caused me some discomfort:  Why dont you write in your own language? I mumbled something  in reply; I hoped hed go away. Its not that I didnt have  a reason: I, a Bengali, had grown up in Bombay, and, not  having been taught Bengali in school, didnt know it well  enough to write poetry or fiction in it. My literary models  and aspirations belonged to the English language; yet, secretly,  Id long been troubled by what my inquisitor implied: that  you cant achieve anything worthwhile in literature unless  you write in your own language. It becomes easier to understand  my particular disquiet, the reasons for my being in England,  standing outside Dillons, and my ambition to be a writer  in the English language, by looking back to Michael Madhusudan  Dutt, with whom, in India, such journeys and disquiets largely  begin. I, indeed, found myself reacquainting myself with  his life and, in a small way, his work, for the purposes  of an anthology I was editing. He was, of course, already  familiar to me as a mythological figure in my childhood,  the first figure to give literary history in India, in effect,  a sense of theatre; like Shakespeares Moor, to whom his  contemporaries compared him, his life and practice form  a parable of inner and actual exile, a negotiation between  the civilized and the barbaric.  Dutt was born in 1824 into a well-to-do  middle-class family, in a Bengal where a native bourgeoisie  and intelligentsia had already come into being. Inscribed  into his life is another narrative, to do with the secular,  middle-class Indian selfs struggle between disowning and  recovering its  for the want of a better word  Indianness,  a struggle that, as I was compiling material for the anthology,  I found was a paradigm around which a substantial part of  modern Indian literature and culture was structured.  Dutt studied at the Bishops College  and the Hindu College in Calcutta, where, not long before,  the Anglo-Portuguese poet, Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, had  taught. By the time Dutt arrived there, the major articulations  of modernity by Indians, in the spheres of religious and  social reform, were already marked by conflicting currents  of disowning and recovery. Raja Rammohun Roy had founded  the reformist sect, the Brahmo Samaj, in 1828; it constituted,  after Roys contact with the culture and religion of the  British colonizer (and owing not a little to the Islamic  culture of the past), a rejection, or disowning, of the  polytheistic, idolatrous aspects of Hinduism. But instead  of completing this act of disowning, and converting to Christianity,  Roy transformed it into an act of recovery by turning back  to the Upanishads, and enlisting the nameless monotheistic  deity in their passages as the foundation for a transcendental  protestantism.  The figure of Michael Madhusudan  Dutt belongs to this context  of Roy, of the intermittently  comic, but nevertheless seminal, radicalism of Young Bengal,  of the breaking of dietary and religious taboos, of social  reform. In his personal and creative life, we see, again,  the related impulses towards, on the one hand, the disowning  of tradition, and its recovery as a creative constituent  of the secular self on the other. Crucially, however, he  translates the public acts of disowning and recovery that,  so far, marked the spheres of religious debate and social  reform, into the personal sphere of art. In a sense, almost,  he suddenly, and unprecedentedly, gifts the Bengali a relationship  between identity, rebellion, creativity, and the subconscious.  Dutt began his creative endeavour  by writing poetry in the English language, and completed  a substantial work, The Captive Ladie; his ambition  was to be a canonical English poet. When still a student,  he converted to Christianity; this was his first great act  of disowning. Whether he converted in reaction to the Hinduism  he, like many of his generation, had come to feel impatient  with, or in his desire to become more completely English  (and further his career as an English poet), or in defiance  of his father, is not known. At any rate, he hardly seems  to have led a conventional Christian life. If Dutt disowned  his father and his religion, his father, in turn, disowned  him, quite literally. The Oedipal conflict between father  and son may not necessarily be the most productive way of  looking at Indian culture, but it would certainly seem to  play a part in shaping Dutts life; it would appear modernity  entered Bengali culture and poetry, via Dutt, not  by a slaying of the colonizer, but of the father. Around the late 1850s, after the  long process of disowning, began the process of recovery,  the reappropriation, by Dutt, of the Bengali language and  culture, culminating in his epic poem, Meghnad Badha  Kabya. Now, rejecting the language in which he had invested  his literary ambitions, he turned to his mother-tongue,  not yet quite a respectable language for the middle class.  Already, before embarking on the epic, he had written the  long Bengali poem, Tilottama Sambhava; in a long,  vivid letter written in English, on May 15, 1860, he had  confessed to his friend, Raj Narain: I am going on with  Meghnad by fits and starts. Perhaps the poem will be finished  by the end of the year. Then, in some flippant sentences,  he delineated the nature of the recovery he was undertaking:  I am glad you like the opening lines. I must tell you,  my dear fellow, that though, as a jolly Christian youth,  I dont care a pins head for Hinduism, I love the grand  mythology of our ancestors. It is full of poetry. This  is followed by an exclamation both excited and desperate,  an almost maritime, Raleigh-like view of literary possibility:  What a vast field does our country now present for literary  enterprise! I wish to God, I had time. The word enterprise  is both striking and estranging; it reminds us, at once,  of the material contexts, in a Bengal of middlemen, of Dutts  epic inversion; and of the fact that the literary pioneer  is part visionary and part adventurer. Dutts comic but grandiose remarks  about not caring a pins head for Hinduism, but loving,  all the same, the grand mythology of [his] ancestors for  its poetry contain a serious and, till then, unexpressed  truth. For Dutt speaks not so much as a jolly Christian  youth as a very early vehicle for what we now rather vaguely  call the secular Indian sensibility, to which the rejection  of indigenous culture and religion, relegating them to the  realm of superstition and irrationality, would be an important  act on the one hand; as would, on the other, its recovery  of that very culture as a life-giving, if perennially problematic,  part of itself. Roughly after Dutts casual exhortations,  the gods and goddesses would begin to appear not as deities,  as they would to a devotee, but as actors upon the stage  of the secular consciousness, to which their meaning and  power would no longer be orthodoxly religious, but nevertheless  profound. It was a form of darshan; but the passive  and grateful devotion of the worshipper had been transformed  into the slightly adversarial gaze of the romantic visionary. Disowning and recovery are, indeed,  written into the very composition of Meghnad Badha Kabya:  Dutts rejection of English in favour of Bengali for the  purposes of writing his epic was itself an immensely significant,  almost an exhibitionistic, act of recovery. They are inscribed,  too, into the subject matter and Dutts treatment of it;  Dutts epic reworks an episode from the Hindu epic, the  Ramayana (which hed heard from his mother as a child),  except that, as we know, Dutt made the son of Ravana, the  hero Ramas traditional adversary, the tragic protagonist  of his poem. Dutt used the Miltonic inversion of Paradise  Lost to make the transition from the certainties of  a religious epic, and religion itself, to the ambivalences  of a secular work; I hate Rama and all his rabble, said  Dutt in another of his letters, speaking with the voice  of an India that would find imaginative sustenance in its  epics and religious texts while never literally engaging  with their sacredness; literature, with Dutt, and for the  sort of modernism he ushers in, doesnt quite become a substitute  for religion, as it was for Arnold; it becomes, in its relationship  with religion, a process of self-division, of qualified  wonder, of aesthetic joy and a not-quite-rational anger  and fear, of immersion and distancing, of open-armed welcoming  and angry refutation. All these registers are audible in  Dutts meditations, in his letters, upon his enterprise. (PART I OF A FIVE-PART  ESSAY)

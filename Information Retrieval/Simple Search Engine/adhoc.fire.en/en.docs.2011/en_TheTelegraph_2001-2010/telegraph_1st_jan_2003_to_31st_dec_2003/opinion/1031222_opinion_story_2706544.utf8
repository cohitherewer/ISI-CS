		 Monday, December 22, 2003  STILL NOT THE PERFECT SHINE
 - Euphoria should not blind India to what is necessary for  development  COMMENTARAO S.L. RAO The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission raoslhotmail.com  At a recent conference on globalization  the discussion was focussed on the how rather than the  what or why issues that had dominated the subject until  recently. The success stories of Indian companies that had  begun to look at the world as the market and the new opportunities  in areas in which Indian companies could leverage their  competences to become globally competitive, were presented  and discussed. There was a perceptible air of euphoria among  the audience of distinguished corporate experts, academics  and students. India had made it. We have arrived in the  global economy. This will be the decade of India. No one  can beat us. Such sentiments could be heard over tea and  lunch. Of course it is highly premature  to voice many of these sentiments. A handful of Indian companies  have become quality and cost leaders and made significant  thrusts into global markets. The world is recognizing the  contribution of Indian-origin doctors, nurses, engineers,  information technology professionals, managers, scientists,  academics and many others who have been working outside  India for many years. Their numbers have reached critical  mass, many have reached dizzy heights in their newly adopted  countries and the visibility of Indians in these countries  have made for wide recognition of Indian capability.  The Indian proficiency in English,  ability to learn new skills quickly, originality in approach  to problems, and much lower costs if employed in India than  similar professionals in say, the United States of America,  allied to the new ability because of information technology  to detach work from physical presence at a location have  enhanced their acceptance and success. In some product areas  like pharmaceuticals, automotive ancillaries, precision  engineering and so on, Indian companies have been very successful  overseas. Some are buying up companies overseas or setting  up offices and factories there. They are truly aiming at  a global and not only an Indian market. But there are many more both in  the organized and almost universally in the unorganized  sector, that have made little headway in improving quality,  productivity and costs. There is the critical agricultural  sector that is stagnating at low levels of productivity  thanks to poor public investment in rural infrastructure,  distorted pricing policies for inputs and outputs and excessive  population pressure on land because of lack of alternative  non-farm occupations.  Employment growth of 2.7 per cent  per annum in 1983-94 declined to 1.07 per cent in 1994-2000.  There was near stagnation in agricultural employment. Despite  growth in services like trade, tourism, transport, communications,  financial and social services, the overall employment growth  halved. The share of casual in total employment continues  to rise. Poverty measures show a decline from 36 per cent  to 26.1 per cent between 1994 and 2000. But there are still  320 million people who are so poor that they cannot afford  two square meals a day. A large part of the economy and  population remains outside the wonderful developments that  we are celebrating. What are these features that we  are celebrating? Some people say that we have reached developed  country status because like the most developed countries,  the service sector dominates at 52 per cent of the gross  domestic product. This should actually cause serious concern,  not rejoicing. Given the low levels of consumption by a  vast number of people, it is the real economy of physical  production from agriculture and industry that should dominate  for many years, not decline as they have been doing. International recognition for  the quality of Indian workers and professionals will help  more human exports and greater inward remittances as well  as investment in India to take advantage of the low costs  of these brains. This is not going to transform the lives  of the majority. It will benefit a few urban educated professionals  and the people who supply the goods and services that they  buy.  Soaring foreign exchange reserves  reflect the decline in the American economy and the inward  flows of moneys kept abroad by Indian businessmen. They  are bringing it back because India is more reliable now  than it was, the rupee is strong and the new laws on defaulting  borrowers make it imperative that they settle their debts  for fear of losing their enterprises in India. Yes, exports  are picking up but not by much. So are investment inflows  especially into stock markets, but these are volatile and  could slow down as quickly.  Do booming stock markets and the  improving rupee value to the dollar mean that we now have  sustainable development and will soon eradicate poverty  and unemployment? These are at best good signals. We have  a long way to go before the good factors like improved  productivity, lower costs, better quality and so on, infect  the rest of industry and economy. Low interest rates, better  management of working capital, economy and efficiency measures  that were forced on industries by severe competition and  poor demand growth since 1995, and some export growth, have  made for better industrial growth this year. But this industrial  growth is on the low base of industrial performance last  year and is a statistical mirage until we show similar percentages  next year as well.  Let us also not get carried away  by the 7 per cent GDP growth forecast made by many for this  year. A good monsoon has pushed up agricultural growth this  year and it may cross 9 per cent. Drought conditions last  year kept the growth at almost static levels. Hence even  with a good monsoon we cannot expect the agricultural growth  next year to be much more than the usual 2 to 3 per cent.  That means a loss in overall GDP growth of 1.5 to 2 per  cent. To keep GDP growth at 7 per cent, industrial production  must rise by an additional 6 per cent or so over the current  year. There is as yet no sign of this momentum.  The golden quadrilateral roads  project generated employment and demand. It visibly improved  infrastructure. But power supply remains poor, railways  are wholly un-commercial, water is a serious problem both  for agriculture and household use, schools and health care  for the poor are neglected, communal peace is fragile, red  tape and bureaucracy impose needless hurdles and delays,  criminals increasingly become politicians, and corruption  is endemic. When these improve, growth can become consistent.  Are people really bothered about corruption? Allegations  against Jayalalithaa, Mayavati, Mulayam Singh, Sharad Pawar  and many lesser figures at national, state and local levels  do not yet seem to have hurt most of them in elections. For a fundamental change to sustainable  high growth we must have substantial improvement in primary  equity issues, acceleration of capital goods production  and imports, large increases in public investment in rural  roads, storage, transportation, water recharging and salinity  control. We need much greater emphasis on competence than  inheritance in managing companies. We must see transparent  corporate governance. We need to see increases in investment  in rail, road, civil aviation, power, urban water and sanitation  and such other investments with economic and social multiplier  effects. We also need fundamental policy changes in subsidy  policies, agricultural pricing, disinvestments and onerous  taxation (as on petroleum products and electricity) so that  the present distorted price signals for investment are reversed.  There is little sign of these happening soon.  That is not to say that India  will not shine but it is not shining as yet. The president  is right when he says we must not be defeatist but become  winners. To be winners we need more than just attitude.  With vision we must have detailed plans and competent execution.  The prime minister, Atal Bihari  Vajpayee, has changed the idea of India. Everyone recognizes  that when he leaves office, any successor will have to deal  with a policy framework that has transformed India from  what it was under 40 years of Congress and leftist rule.  But much remains to be done. It must be done fast if growth  is to get momentum. We cannot afford to allow euphoria to  cloud our clarity in seeing what must be done at every level  in society.

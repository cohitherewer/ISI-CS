The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 DEATH IN THE AIR
																								Sometimes slowness is murder. The West Bengal government was still trying to haggle with the Calcutta high court for some more time to comply with the Bharat stage-II emission standard for all vehicles in the city. The court has refused to extend its deadline, and if it continues to do so, then all offending vehicles will have to be off the roads by early April next year. Around eight months have already passed since the court had set its April 2004 deadline. Nothing had been done, therefore, towards meeting it. And to pray now for another extension is, by the absolute logic of the value of human lives, nothing less than murderous. Air pollution, in the mean time, has gone up to barbaric levels in the city. The state pollution control board has recorded an alarming daily increase of nitrogen oxide levels in the air, and the culprits are almost entirely the citys unconverted vehicles. 																								This is particularly culpable since, over the last few years, environmental activism has managed to control, and even bring down industrial pollution to a very significant extent in the city and its suburbs. Big and small industries here have either moved or reformed themselves, so that three quarters of the air pollution is entirely because of the vehicles  numbering around 15 lakh, out of which only about 2 lakh meet the Bharat II norm. This would mean either conversion or confiscation, both of which would need technological infrastructure or political will. Arranging for converters and adequate liquid petroleum or compressed natural gas supplies will have to be speeded up beyond actually realizable limits. Politically, the greatest problem will be with the auto-rickshaws, which cannot be converted for being run on safer fuels. The suspension of any thinking or action on all this on popular political grounds is of the worst order of culpability. Urban development is understood by this government purely in terms of the unthinking construction of flyovers and shopping malls. Never mind if all these splendid new structures come up in a vast gas chamber, which is doing irreparable, often terminal, damage to the lungs and eyes of Calcuttas citizens. A callousness which refuses to fathom the urgency of the situation can only be described as evil.

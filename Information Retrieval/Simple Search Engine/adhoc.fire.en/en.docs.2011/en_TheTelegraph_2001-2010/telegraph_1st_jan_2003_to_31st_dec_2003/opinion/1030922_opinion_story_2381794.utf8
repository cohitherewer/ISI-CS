		 Monday, September 22, 2003  Family and other managers
 - Who is the true professional?  Commentarao / S.L. Rao The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, raoslhotmail.com Many have said for years that  to achieve competitiveness, businesses must invest in research  and development, brand building, nurturing its human capital  at all levels, paying attention to what employees have to  say and focussing on cost improvement programmes. Their  most important task is to identify and appoint the most  suitable persons to lead the company and to have a line  of succession. Some have condensed this requirement into  one word, that professionals should run the company. But  who is a professional? It is assumed that they cannot  include members of the controlling family. So the Singhanias,  Wadias, Goenkas, and others belonging to the families of  the founders of the business are not counted as professionals.  This is regardless of their qualifications. In the Nineties, as competition  intensified, many companies started recruiting the most  competent people they could find in marketing, finance,  human resources, and so on. But the best among these outsiders  soon were not satisfied with high-sounding designations  and compensation packages. They wanted to run the whole  company. When they saw that the top slot was reserved for  someone from the family they left for better opportunities.  A few family-run companies made way at the top for qualified  outsiders in whom they had confidence. Even in some of these  in recent months the sons with excellent academic qualifications  and some experience have started jostling for the top positions  and to replace the non-family persons. All enterprises whether businesses  or non-governmental social organizations (even the business  of politics!) are started by individuals. Each of them has  a dream, a vision, and a passion to build something. With  some businesses the individual had no choice but to start  an enterprise. The refugee entrepreneurs after Partition  left all their property and possessions behind like Raunaq  Singh of Apollo, Nanda of Escorts, Munjal of Hero and others.  In the South, the Chettiar families similarly left Burma  and Malaysia after the war, probably not as poor as the  Northern refugees. Others, like Dhirubhai Ambani, were men  driven by vision and passion to do something special, something  different and build institutions and demonstrate their capability.  J.N. Tata at the turn of the century, N.R. Narayana Murthy,  Anji Reddi and others are in this group.  Yet others started businesses  that were a hotchpotch of enterprises that were put together  because their contacts and connections with the all-powerful  in government got them in the pre-Nineties the required  licences and permits. Some ran them well by appointing competent  people, not necessarily from their families, to run each  enterprise separately. Others ran them as conglomerates  and began to divest and split them as liberalization made  large extra demands on financial and human resources. In todays competitive world,  enterprises are not created by contact and connection. An  individual has a dream and mobilizes people and money to  make it come true. Businesses that think connections alone  are enough are dying. But individuals build enterprises  and fortunes, (equally so with political families) as inheritance  for his spouse, children, relatives and even friends and  colleagues and as his monument. The best people to sustain  and build on his monument he thinks are his family. But  today such bequests are not as easy. A shopkeeper, a small  artisan, an owner of a small industry who wholly own their  business can bequeath it to their progeny to run and enable  them to have a living. But when there are other shareholders  questions arise as to whether the family person is the most  competent to run it for protecting and enhancing the value  of the investments in the business for the benefit of all  shareholders. In India for most of the fifty  years after independence the prevailing environment enabled  families to bequeath businesses, however big, to other members  of the family regardless of competence or qualifications.  For many of these years the closed economy with central  direction of all resources meant not only licensing and  permissions for any industrial activity but also penal levels  of taxation (income, customs and excise). The only way to  enable families of promoters to live in comfort was to  be employed in the business and they could not be employed  anywhere except at the top.  In any case they could not harm  the business even if they were incompetent since the entry  barriers were strict and the industrial or import licence  enabled monopoly profits. The market was guaranteed, prices  could be raised if costs rose and there was no competition  to force cost reduction, quality or productivity improvement.  With rampant tax avoidance or hawala and over-and  under-invoicing of imports or exports, building funds illegally  abroad had to be handled by family members and some loyal  retainers. This is now perhaps a little less and the need  for loyal family is not as great.  In other countries also there  were families that handed over the business to the next  generation even after the business had grown very large.  But there were many others that employed qualified and experienced  non-family members to run the business. The family kept  a close eye on the performance of the company. This happened  very rarely in India. Almost all enterprises had a glass  ceiling that a non-family manager could never hope to break  through. This tradition was broken in the  Nineties. The liberalization and opening of the economy  brought intense competition and pressure to go for volume,  reduce costs and prices, improve design and quality and  look for new markets. Eicher, Sri Ram Fibres, the TI Group  from the South were some companies that consciously handed  over full managerial control to paid employees, not to paid  family members. There were many others that did not do so-Bajaj,  Ballarpur, J.K., SPIC and many others. While I do not have  the data I doubt if there is any pattern that suggests that  employees have performed better than family members in running  enterprises. But we need to look at results for a while  longer before we can conclude either way. The question of who is a professional  manager has become difficult to resolve in what is not a  professional guild like doctors or accountants or lawyers  with barriers to entry and self-regulation. A successful  entrepreneur may not even have had a college education.  A highly rated MBA might fail as CEO. There are many examples  of both. The experience of the United States of America  has shown that non-family CEOs can be greedy and steal from  their company, that they can fudge accounts and cheat shareholders,  that they can play favourites, be nepotistic, indulge in  insider trading, indeed commit all the offences that popular  imagination attributes only to family managers. Given the  opportunity, some Indian employee managers might also be  doing so. The larger question is one of  governance. When there are other shareholders in a company  they are supposed to have approved the appointment of the  CEO at the annual general meeting. But the majority rule  has always prevailed and even after permitting proxy votes,  the chances are that the largest shareholder even without  majority share ownership will run the company. How can we  ensure that he does it in the best interests of all? The attempt in recent times has  been to do it through legislation and listing rules of Securities  and Exchange Board of India. A much stronger regulatory  framework in the US with far more alert and watchful media  and other organizations has been unable to prevent abuse  of the trust placed in the CEOs.  Perhaps we need to define as professional  mangers the ones who behave as if they hold the enterprise  in trust and not as owners. This must be irrespective of  whether they belong to families that own shares enabling  control of the company or are mere employees.

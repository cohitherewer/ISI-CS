 Satrujit Banerjee				 	 Bombay, 1933																								The Making of a Legend: Lala Amarnath By Rajinder Amarnath, Rupa, Price not mentioned 																								Gymkhana ground, Bombay, December 15,1933. Indias captain, C.K. Nayudu, wins the toss and elects to bat in the first test match against the Douglas Jardine-led England team, fresh from their victory in the Bodyline series against Australia. Making his debut, Lala Amarnath top scores with 38 in Indias total of 219. England amasses 438 in reply. In the second innings, with both openers out for 21, in walks the 22-year-old rookie. Around 117 minutes later, he reaches the three-figure mark to become the first Indian to score a century in test match cricket and the first to hit one on debut. In all, he faced 56 balls for his dazzling 118 with 21 boundaries. Only 5 balls were not scored of. A new star is born. Or is it ?																								Born a nondescript Lal Chand, the more distinctive name of Amarnath, minus a surname, was bestowed on him by his doting mother. In his formative years at Lahore, Amarnaths attacking strokeplay so impressed Frank Tarrant, an Australian coach employed by the Maharaja of Patiala, that he used his considerable influence to secure a berth for Amarnath in the Northern India team to play Jardines MCC. The match was a disaster for the home team and the dashing youngster did not impress much with his 26 in a second innings total of 50 plus. 																								The next game was against Southern Punjab and again Tarrant used his clout to get him included in the team. Batting first, the hosts were 12 for 3, when Amarnath walked in. With his personal score at 3, he edged a ball to the wicket-keeper. There was a loud appeal from the close-in fielders but the umpire negated it. At the end of the over, Jardine walked over to Amarnath and remarked, the bloody sound (of the nick) could have been heard even in Sydney, a none too subtle reference to the nationalities of the two Australian umpires, Frank Tarrant and his son, Lawrence. As in story books, Amarnath made good use of this life to record a century, and the rest, as they say, is history. 																								An analysis of Amarnaths test career reveals that he never lived up to the expectation aroused by his debut test century. He represented India for over 19 years, captaining the side during much of this period. In all, he played 40 innings, scoring 878 runs at a modest 24.38 per innings  the debut century being the solitary one  and took 45 wickets at 32.91 apiece. In the Australian tour of 1947-48, he averaged 14 in 10 completed innings as captain. In the 1946 tour of England, he averaged 13.80 in 5 innings.																								For an interminable period, Lala Amarnath, (the prefix to his name was added midway in his career) was the stormy petrel of Indian cricket. Sent back on disciplinary grounds from England in 1936, he was selected captain 11 years later for Indias first ever tour to Australia. Subsequent to his retirement, he was appointed manager of the touring Indian team to Pakistan in 1954, then became chairman of the selection committee. All along this journey, he seemed to be either combating the intrigue directed against him or fighting his epic battle with Anthony de Mello, the then chairman of the board, who had taken action against him on disciplinary grounds, a case which was never resolved. In between, his spats with fellow selectors almost seemed a byplay.																								For as controversial a character as Amarnath, a fair assessment can never be expected from an adoring son. And this is what the book precisely suffers from. Lala emerges lily white after every allegation against him is disproved and his superior intellect wins every argument, making a mockery of his adversary. It is time someone writes a more objective biography of this Indian enigma.						SATRUJIT BANERJEE

		 Thursday, November 20, 2003  NOT JUST A LESSON IN GEOGRAPHY
 If there are separatist groups in  the Northeast, the fault lies with the little men in North  Block who devise policies for the region, argues Bhaskar  Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting Dress rehearsal  The renewed focus on cow slaughter,  given the approaching elections and even before, the proposed  bill to ban it, brings into focus, once again, an enduring  and shameful aspect of national policy, that is, the total  disregard of the sensibilities and social characteristics  of all the communities that go to make up the country. True,  appropriate regard has to be paid to the sentiments of the  majority, but that cannot be a reason to assume that theirs  are the only sentiments that need to be kept in mind. For  votes, politicians will have no scruples in doing so, but  a government cannot prostitute itself for any political  party, in power or not for that reason.  The fact that beef is a standard  part of the diet of Indians in the Northeast  and is eaten  by Indians who belong to other communities  is not the  issue here. The issue is a larger one  the refusal, or  the inability of those who make policy and take decisions  that affect the country to see the Northeast as an integral  part of the country, in the way Uttar Pradesh or Karnataka  is. It is an inability, really; a deficiency of conception  that no amount of reasoning can correct, or so it seems,  after all these years.  Just consider the record. Weve  had more than fifty years of independence  and what have  we done in that period to provide good, and I mean really  good, communications with the Northeast? Oh yes, there is  a rail link that goes as far as Dimapur. Big deal. Its  a shoddy link, just one line, and the trains run only when  the officials feel like running them. There are plans to  extend it, one hears, plans being resolutely blocked by  the penny-wise in the finance ministry on grounds that the  country cant afford it?  Cant afford it? Weve just heard  that theyve cleared a project to send a satellite to the  moon, costing over Rs 300 crore, and we cant afford a network  of railway lines in the Northeast? Ah, they will tell you  in hushed tones, but the moon satellite is important because  of its security implications. It may well have. So will  many other projects. So why not scrap everything  education,  health, water supply, rural development, everything, and  concentrate on security alone? We can have a nice militarized  country, with security concerns overriding all activities,  and lots of fences, gates, walls, machine guns pointing  at frightened civilians who will have no drinking water,  no schools, no hospitals, no work, but who cares, as long  as tanks abound, and security concerns engage the attention  of the great and the powerful?  Somewhere, sometime, policy-makers  must get real, must smell the coffee. It wont do to sit  in the grubby rooms of North Block poring over files marked  Top Secret. The Northeast needs a network of railway lines,  linking as many parts of it as possible, as it needs good  roads  not the pot-holed narrow strips of second-class  bitumen that pass for national highways. It needs sturdy,  wide dual carriageways to all cities, and towns and good  wide roads from those to the interior regions. Of course  it will cost money. That money has to be found because these  are major projects of much greater importance than sending  a satellite to the moon, whatever its security implications. And thats not all, by any means.  The region needs to be treated like other parts of India   opened up for tourism, with good hotels and guest-houses,  no permits to go anywhere, facilities for sightseeing and  for enjoyment. Were so busy sending tourists to Kashmir  and Ladakh; how about exerting ourselves a little and sending  tourists to the Northeast? What about industries? And the  development of agriculture and animal husbandry, projects  to protect the environment, to market local agricultural  and other farm produce? Not by the creaking old public-sector  outfits that need to be swiftly abolished, but by private  enterprise, who will do it because theyll be able to make  money, as will the producers in the farms and in villages.  What about all this?  Given that very little has been  actually done so far  money has been spent, but it has  gone to ministers and others, not really used for the purposes  for which they were provided  surely a much greater effort  is needed, a much greater importance given in terms of policy.  It wont do for the prime minister to go there occasionally,  wear colourful headgear and drape a colourful shawl around  himself; something much more substantial, something that  will make a difference, must be done and done now. The trouble is with the secret,  dark recesses where decisions are conceived and policies  born. This is where you find little men  little in every  sense  whose idea of India is frightening. It consists  of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana, for the most part,  perhaps Punjab, Rajasthan (occasionally) and Madhya Pradesh.  Thats it. The rest is a grey mass of land and people who  are strange, often funny to these little men, whose chief  function is to support what the India they know does.  And what does their India do?  Rant and rave about temples and mosques, pseudo-secularism  and other such fascination concepts, organize pogroms to  kill, maim and loot, (ask that littlest of little men, Narendra  Modi and hell tell you how to do it) and make loud speeches  about Bharat Mata. You know what Bharat Mata. And  where do these little men come from? Like the orcs in Tolkiens  The Lord of the Rings, they come from the area that  is a blasted, impoverished place where bigotry, casteism,  illiteracy and hatred are endemic, and whose inhabitants  breed like flies. They call it India, Bharat Mata. To other  Indians it is the disaster area of India, the one region  where most of the countrys ills are located.  And in the rest of India, as in  the Northeast, the frustrating lack of infrastructure and  basic facilities gives rise to resentment, all of which  it is in the gift of the little men to provide. But going  beyond that, the mindset of the little men gives rise to  alienation, and bitterness. Not having something is bad  enough; to be surprised that you exist at all is intolerable.  If, then, there are separatist parties and groups, it isnt  so much because of the Northeast as a region as it is because  of the little men in the dark holes of North Block. And yet it is they who talk of  Indias diversity, its multi-faceted culture. What they  really mean is the diversity in Gorakhpur, Arrah and Muzaffarnagar.  The multi-faceted culture is of Haryana and UP. Or  to  the visionaries among them  the odhnis of Rajasthan.  Beyond that its all to do with people in weird costumes  performing folk dances on Republic Day, nothing more. This is where the notion of India  must change if it is to hold together. Perhaps some of the  more enlightened among the power elite, like L.K. Advani,  will realize the abyss in front of which we now stand and  persuade these little men to step back. The true separatists  are not those groups in the Northeast armed with AK-47s;  they are the denizens of the colonies of Delhi to which  they have come like locusts from the dark land around the  capital city; the ones who set out the initial notes in  files and start chain reactions which could end up in disaster.  If lessons in diversity have to be given, it is to this  lot that they must be given first, and over a long period  of time.

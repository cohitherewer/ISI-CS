		 Thursday, October 02, 2003 				 HE WAITED A LONG TIME TO CONNECT
 GOURI CHATTERJEE																								New York, October 2001. The bombing of Afghanistan had begun and Edward Said was visibly agitated. He had not yet been able to get an al-Jazeera connection. Having to depend solely on the American media was, to him, impossible.																								It was not just a lifelong exiles longing for news in his own tongue. The Palestinian scholar who died last week had long had a love-hate relationship with the American media. 																								Incensed by its coverage of Irans Islamic revolution and the 1979 hostage crisis, he came out with a slim volume in 1981 that forever changed the way the world looked at the media. In fact, the central thesis of Covering Islam  that the Western media is responsible for the popular perception of all Muslims as terrorists and barbaric  appears quite commonplace today. Said said it first.																								Since then he has often scoffed at preposterous media creations like the Arab street and the Muslim mind  but to little avail. I wish I could say that general understanding of the Middle East, the Arabs and Islam in the US media has improved, he wrote just two months before his death. Alas, it really hasnt.																								Handsome, articulate, dapper, he himself was quite a media favourite though. In the Eighties, he would often have to cut classes to appear on television  arguing the Palestinian cause. In recent years, such encounters could cause extreme irritation. Once, a friend writes, when I went on air the Israeli consul in New York said I was a terrorist and wanted to kill him. And what did the anchorwoman say to me? Mr Said, why do you want to kill the Israeli consul? How do you reply to such garbage?																								Edward Said got his al Jazeera connection shortly before the war in Afghanistan ended. Wheres the bite?																								At last, a serious magazine. Or at least one that is self-professedly so. There is little that scares the popular press more than this word. Lively, credible, unputdownable, sabse tez, there are many ways the media would like to describe itself. But not serious. To most, its just another word for boring.																								The first, October, issue of National Review, a monthly magazine, marks itself out to be different simply by declaring NR is a serious magazine. The opening note from editor-in-chief, Inderjit Badhwar (ex-India Today), claims, NR will add a new dimension and bite to the media world of political analysisOur purpose is to become the voice of the intelligentsia.																								If only it were so easy.																								It doesnt help that the inaugural issue is full of tired and over-exposed names like J.N. Dixit, Inder Malhotra, Bibek Debroy, Farrukh Dhondy...Hardly the people to turn to to make a difference. 																								The deeper problem is the magazines own thinking, its lack of a worldview apart from such vague notions as the creed of humanism. The hallmark of both The Economist and the New Republic, the two role models Badhwar cites, are their clear, rather trenchant points of view. The National Review has none. It needs to get hold of one and get it fast, if it really wants to, as it says, add a new dimension and bite to the media world. Fodder fixation																								How do you get your news, Mr President? George Bush did not equivocate. I get briefed by Andy Card and Condi in the morning, he told the Fox News interviewer last week. They come in and tell me. I glance at the headlines just to kind of get a flavour for whats moving. I rarely read the stories, and get briefed by people who probably read the news themselves. But like Condoleezza, in her case the national security adviser is getting her news directly from the participants on the world stage.																								That should put all journalists in their place. But the most powerful man in the world still cant better the strongman of Bihar. A few months ago Laloo Prasad Yadav told his supporters, dont read newspapers, feed them to your cows instead.

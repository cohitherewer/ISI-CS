The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, May 04, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Change in the recipe 				 																																																				Sir  Masala mogul spins Hinglish dream (April 30)  possibly only for the time being. Heavyweight producers like Subhash Ghai will experiment with anything to sell their films, whether the mystery of the choli, a Koirala from the Nepali kingdom, a former Miss World or a mixed tongue. Each is calculated to add to the jingle in the cash box. This means if Hinglish movies fail to make the necessary music, which they are likely to do given the illiteracy of the Ghai audience, the adventure is likely to be shelved. Anyway, the new masala wont change Indian tastes.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Gouranga Halder, Calcutta
				 																Gang ho				 																																																				Sir  The report, Dawoods moles in khadi and khaki (March 3), makes no exceptional observation. The politician-policeman-criminal nexus is a common one. If anything at all is out of the ordinary, it is the amount of official patronage that has gone into the making of Dawood Ibrahim the icon that he is today. Not only do the police shield Dawoods gang, they also act as his uniformed loyal servicemen in bumping off rival gang members, and in helping him recruit new members through jails. With active political and administrative assistance, Dawood today is the uncrowned king of Mumbai underworld. Little wonder the Indian police has been so hopelessly unsuccessful in nabbing either his brother or his deputy, Chhota Shakeel. Who knows, Dawood may even be found to have a hotline to the prime minister. But even that wouldnt surprise, would it?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The manner in which the word khadi has been depicted in the report, Dawoods moles in khadi and khaki, has hurt the sentiments of millions of khadi lovers, including the Khadi and Village Industries Commission which espouses the cause of khadi. It has affected the image of the khadi sector which has provided employment to more than 8 lakh people, mostly women in rural areas of the country. The fabric, which was once the symbol of our freedom struggle, has been associated with the underworld in a manner which may cause aversion to khadi among many in India. 				 																																																				While a lot of effort is being made by the Central and state governments, khadi commission and industry boards, fashion institutes across the country to improve the quality of the product, diversify the range and work towards a better market share, the headline of the report may make a negative impression in the minds of the young generation at whose patronage khadi is expected to prosper tomorrow. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Chinmay Basu, CEO, Khadi and Village Industries Commission, Mumbai

				 																Take note				 																																																				Sir  Staplers undoubtedly damage notes. But currency is the most damaged when one twists and forcibly opens the bundles (Teller count on staple fare, April 27). It is a fact that there would be considerable delay at cash counters of banks if the notes were not stapled and the cash had to be counted. But there is also no guarantee that all stapled bundles have the requisite notes. Several readers may have experienced this trouble. It is unlikely that cash dispensing machines could solve the problem either since customers would invariably count their money before they leave the counter. 				 																																																				Both banks and customers could use a tool easily available in the market with which stapled notes are opened quite smoothly. The other option is to sew the notes together with a thread and then seal the bundle. The customer just has to cut open the thread to get the loose notes. The Reserve Bank of India should remember that penalizing banks will not solve the problem in a hurry.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, 

				 																																																				Calcutta 				 																																																				Sir  It is unfortunate that nationalized banks should disregard the Reserve Bank of India directives with impunity. Customers should refuse to accept stapled notes. Only such strong action will force the errant banks to fall in line.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

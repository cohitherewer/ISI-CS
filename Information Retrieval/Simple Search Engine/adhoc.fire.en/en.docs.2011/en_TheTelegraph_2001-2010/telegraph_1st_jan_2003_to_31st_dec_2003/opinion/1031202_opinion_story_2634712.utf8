		 Tuesday, December 02, 2003 				 TRANSLATING DREAMS INTO REALITY
 															- Document  Extracts from the Madrid International  Plan of Action on Ageing, April 2002 				 	 Special case																								We urge developed countriesto make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 per cent of GNP of developed countries to least developed countries, and encourage developing countries to build on progress achieved in ensuring that official development assistance is used effectively to help achieve development goals... 																								Enhanced and focussed international cooperation and an effective commitment by developed countries and international development agencies will enhance and enable the implementation of the International Plan of Action. International financial institutions and regional development banks are invited to examine and adjust their lending and grants practices to ensure older persons are recognized as a development resource and are taken into account in their policies and projects as part of efforts to assist developing countries...																								Similarly, commitment by United Nations funds and programmes to ensure integration of the question of ageing in their programmes and projects, including at country level, is important. Support by the international community and international development agencies for organizations that specifically promote training and capacity-building on ageing in developing countries is important. 																								Other priorities...should include exchange of experiences and best practices, researchers and research findings and data to support policy and programme development; establishing income-generating projects; and information dissemination. 																								The UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination should include implementation of the International Plan of Action on Ageing in its agenda. The focal points that were set up within the UN system in preparation for the World Assembly on Ageing should be maintained and strengthened....the primary action of the department of economic and social affairs programme on ageing will be to facilitate and promote...design guidelines for policy development and implementation; advocate means to mainstream ageing issues into development agendas; engage in dialogue with civil society and the private sector; and information exchange. 																								The UN regional commissions have responsibility for translating the International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002, into their action plans. They should also assist national institutions in implementation and monitoring of their actions on ageing. The Economic and Social Council could strengthen the capacity of the regional commissions. Regional non-governmental organizations should be supported in their efforts to develop networks to promote the International Plan of Action.																								There is a need to encourage and advance comprehensive, diversified and specialized research on ageing...Research, including age and gender-sensitive data collection and analysis, provides essential evidence for effective policies...The availability of reliable information is indispensable in identifying emerging issues and adopting recommendations. Elaborating and using comprehensive and practical tools for evaluation, such as key indicators, is also necessary to facilitate a timely policy response.... 																								Systematic review of implementation of the International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002 by member states is essential for its success in improving the quality of life of older persons...Sharing of the outcomes of regular review among member states would be valuable. 																								The Commission for Social Development will be responsible for follow-up and appraisal of the implementation...Reviews and appraisals will be critical for effective follow-up to the assembly and their modalities should be decided as soon as possible.

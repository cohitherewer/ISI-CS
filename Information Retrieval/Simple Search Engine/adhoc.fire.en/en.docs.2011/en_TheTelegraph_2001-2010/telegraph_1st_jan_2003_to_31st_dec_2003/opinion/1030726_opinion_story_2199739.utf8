 - What Miandads autobiography says about his great rival  RAMACHANDRA GUHA ramguhavsnl.com Double-edged  The other day a packet arrived  in the mail from Pakistan. It weighed in excess of a kilogram;  but the return address assured me that it was not a bomb  but a book. It had been sent by the Karachi branch of the  Oxford University Press who, in recent years, have published  a series of fine works on the history and politics of Pakistan.  This one, however, was something else: an autobiography  of the great Sindh, Sussex and Glamorgan cricketer, Javed  Miandad. Miandad is a Mohajir whose family  came originally from Gujarat. His father worked as a policeman  in Ahmedabad before Partition. More to the point, he was  a keen cricketer, and after moving to Karachi ran a popular  sports club. Javed was one of six children, four of them  boys. He played with his siblings and on the street before  graduating to club cricket. He came to maturity early. At  the age of 16 he scored a double hundred for the Sindh under-19  side. Watching him bat was the father of Pakistan cricket,  Abdul Hafeez Kardar. Kardar thought the boy from Karachi  to be the find of the decade. With this recommendation,  Miandad soon found himself in the test side. On his debut,  against New Zealand, he came to the wicket at 44 for 3,  with Richard Hadlee on song. Soon Pakistan were 55 for 4.  Now the debutant engaged in a long, retrieving partnership  with the experienced Asif Iqbal, a man he resembled in quickness  of eye, fleetness of foot, and a relish for the fight. Asif  scored a century, as did Javed, the first of 23 hundreds  he was to make for his country. Javed, or more likely his publisher,  has titled this book Cutting Edge. In years of watching  him at the ground and on television, I cannot remember many  edges. But there were plenty of cuts, slashed hard through  point. In addition he drove capably, was adept at playing  off his legs, and could pull and hook too. He was not a  particularly elegant player, but a greatly effective one.  One of my most painful cricketing memories is of seeing  a young Miandad hit my boyhood hero, B.S. Chandrasekhar,  for two straight sixes. Fifteen years later, I saw him similarly  dispatch a rather inferior wrist-spinner, Ian Salisbury  of England. But, unlike so many of his countrymen,  Miandad was a fine player of fast bowling too. He got solidly  into line, and knew where his off stump was. He had a marvellous  record against Australia and the West Indies, the sides  that had the best new-ball bowlers. Beyond his technical  abilities, he paced his innings very well, and was a superb  runner between the wickets. All things considered, he ranks  just above Hanif Mohammed as Pakistans greatest ever batsman. This cameo assessment of his batsmanship  is mine, not Javeds. His autobiography itemizes his main  achievements, but naturally cannot analyse them. What it  does do, however, is to provide an extended and absolutely  frank assessment of his relationship with Imran Khan. In  character and background, they were a study in contrast.  One was an aristocrat who went to Oxford via a Lahore  public school, the other a plebeian, educated (for the most  part) in the streets of Karachi. One cavorted with artists  and millionaires in London, the other kept strictly to his  native social mileu. They were different, but they were  also contemporary. Thus it was Pakistans good fortune that  its best-ever bowler came to cricketing maturity at the  same time as its best-ever batsman. Javed is generous in his praise  of Imran the cricketer. As a bowler he was irreplaceable.  The combination of pace, guile and reverse-swing made Imran  absolutely lethal. Then, having mastered fast bowling,  he turned his attention to batting with great method and  application. Indeed, Imrans capacity for hard work is  an example to all aspiring cricketers. Miandad also handsomely praises  Imrans leadership skills. When the Pathan became captain  of Pakistan, he led from the front and created an atmosphere  in which there was no room for mediocrity. He made selection  strictly performance-based. Everyone feared for their place  in the side, and it motivated them to give of their best.  It helped that unlike some other Pakistani cricket captains,  this one was squeaky clean. For, as Miandad points out,  Imrans is a famous name in cricket, but the great thing  is that it also remains an unvarnished name. There have  been no scandals, no allegations of him being anything less  than impeccably honest. At the same time, Miandad is critical  of Imran the team-man. For the better part of a decade the  two men alternated as captain. As I did for other Pakistan  captains, so I gave my best for Imran as well, writes Javed,  adding, I was hurt when Imran did not return the gesture.  He speaks of a series against Sri Lanka when Imran didnt  give me his full cooperation. At other times, the Pathan  would opt out of the side when he was not named skipper.  Thus Imran played in only 13 of the 34 tests when Javed  was captain, whereas Javed played in as many as 46 of the  48 tests when Imran led the side. Yet, says Miandad meaningfully,  both of us won the same number of Tests for Pakistan   fourteen. I was present in each one of Imrans test victories,  but he was present in only five of mine. All of his wins  came from a full-strength team, while more than half of  mine came from a team with a second-string bowling attack  from which our best bowler was missing. Cutting Edge also speaks  at length of the major team rivalry of Miandads career,  India versus Pakistan. There are analyses of tests  and series between the two sides, and a not excessively  self-congratulatory recounting of the famous last-ball six  in Sharjah. He advises the Indian Cricket Board to prepare  fast pitches if they want to produce their own equivalents  of Imran, Waqar and Wasim. And he meditates reflectively  on the linking of sport with patriotism. A nations self-esteem  cannot be held hostage to its sporting fortunes, he says,  One has to stop seeing cricket as a proxy war and a cricket  loss as a political failure. The words in this book might have  been polished by the ghost-writer (Saad Shafqat), but the  thoughts are indisputably Miandads. Indeed, the book has  a directness notably absent in south Asian autobiographies,  whether sporting or otherwise. There are some sharp cricketing  judgments. Gavaskar, says Miandad, was a better batsman  than Tendulkar, Abdul Qadir a better wrist-spinner than  Shane Warne, and Muralitharan without doubt the best off  spinner in the history of the game. There are some perceptive  bits of psychology as well. Consider this, which applies  equally to India as it does to Pakistan: Many of our star  players, after they have become successful on the field  and have received some public recognition, develop an inordinate  sense of their own importance. They cease to be team players  and expect special treatment. This divisive attitude disturbs  team unity and keeps us from rising to our true potential. This frankness should not surprise  us  what might are the bouts of empathy, so unexpected  in a man reckoned to be one of the toughest competitors  in the history of the game. When Pakistan dramatically beat  the Kiwis on their home turf in the semi-finals of the 1992  World Cup, Miandad recalled his sides own loss in the same  stage of the tournament five years before. Having been  in the Pakistans side that lost that greatly hyped-up World  Cup semi-final against Australia in 1987, I identified with  the New Zealand team. I was sad for them and for the New  Zealand public. Even more striking, perhaps, are  Miandads comments on the aftermath of the 1992 World Cup  final. After Pakistan won, Javed held his captain in a long  and utterly sincere embrace, and then wrapped the national  flag around him. Still later, Imran, speaking as the victorious  captain, did not so much as mention his players, dwelling  instead on the cancer hospital he was building in his mothers  memory. To the independent observer, that victory speech  was a disgraceful exhibition of egotism. How must it have  felt to the slighted Pakistan team?  Listen to Miandad. It appears  he was not angry or hurt; rather, he could sympathize with  Imran on this count. His public-speaking skills were modest  to begin with, and now he was asked to deliver such a high-profile  speech when he had just crowned his cricketing career with  the achievement of a lifetime. Imran meant well, says Miandad.  That he said all the wrong things was only because he was  emotionally overwrought. I should know, comments Imrans  great team-mate and rival, because it was an intense emotional  moment for me as well. I had a huge lump in my throat   but at least I had the option of not having to speak.

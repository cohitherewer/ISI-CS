 It is because we do not promote intrinsic  motivation in education that we are failing to establish standards  of intellectual excellence, argues Devi Kar The author is principal, Modern High  School for Girls, Calcutta Toppers shop  It is a seasonal epidemic that  comes round every year. In West Bengal, the timing cannot  be predicted with precision, somewhat like the arrival of  the monsoons. But it arrives nonetheless, with its mandatory  fanfare of photographs of topper sons and mothers. Interviews  on television, felicitation ceremonies, awards and advertisements  (of coaching classes claiming credit for producing the toppers)  follow in their wake. In the midst of this overwhelming  but routine mass hysteria, we never pause to think of the  grave damage that this pointless annual exercise causes  to our society. Firstly, the pressure on students to score  higher and higher marks result in their opting for subjects  that are perceived to be scoring, irrespective of their  aptitude or interest.  Here the Indian School Certificate  and the Central Board of Secondary Education systems of  assessment have a definite advantage over the system adopted  by the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education,  whereby subjects such as history, language and literature  are not awarded marks on a par with subjects that are overtly  quantifiable, such as mathematics or accountancy. The consequence  is that students who have demonstrated excellence in the  humanities or social sciences and have had the courage to  choose these fields in a time when such subjects are regarded  as useless or interesting but not job-oriented, receive  no accolades at all. This is a very dangerous thing. We must acknowledge the phenomenon  of multiple intelligences. Excellence is pluralistic in  nature and it comes in many forms. Yet at the school level,  we tend to honour only a minuscule part of the full range.  Just as we need excellent doctors and engineers, we also  need excellent writers, historians, workmen and artists.  Indeed, an excellent carpenter deserves much more admiration  than a third-rate engineer. The very quality of our society  depends on the pursuit of excellence in every sphere and  in every kind of activity. And this must be recognized in  the formative years  from the school level. Performing well in a public examination  is necessary for practical purposes. However, the recent  inflation of marks, has taken away some of its practical  value. More and more institutions are disregarding board  results and designing their own admission procedures. In  any case, the wisdom of judging students on the basis of  a single examination is highly suspect. Many a student has  scored higher than his or her intellectually superior peers  by adopting smart examination-tackling strategies. It has  been observed that the most influential factor in the process  of learning in high school is students perceptions of the  way marks are awarded. Thus, we have coaching centres sprouting  all over our city and now they are mushrooming in the districts  as well. They are reputed to be well armed with good notes  and sure-fire suggestions(the jargon for likely examination  questions). The powers that be have tried  to stop this business of private tuition but  expectedly   have not succeeded. After all, extrinsic motivation that  sees education as merely a way of obtaining necessary qualifications  for a bright, lucrative career is a potent force. But the  pursuit of fast tracks, short cuts and instant gratification  has led to widespread shallowness and mediocrity. Much of our despair over mediocrity  and the sorry absence of excellence in the present social  scenario is a result of our failure to realize that mindless  competition in education is damaging to intellect, imagination  and health  physical as well as mental. There is no qualitative  difference whatsoever between 977 and 971  the marks of  the Uchcha Madhyamik topper and the second position  holder. This kind of ranking is an example of what Bertrand  Russell calls the social element in school education that  lays emphasis on socially verifiable excellences. (It  is significant that the ISC system gives no division and  makes no ranking in its results. Yet the media discovers  toppers in this system as well). In his essay, Competition  in Education, Russell writes that out of a class  of 100, 90 learn from fear of punishment, 9 from a competitive  desire for success, and only 1 from a love of knowledge  or intrinsic motivation. John Holt, in his brilliant book  entitled How Children Fail, refers to the strong  motives of trying to please parents and that of the fear  of failure. Most importantly, he talks of the fear of success  which is likely to generate more pressure to perform even  better. Both writers have asserted that if intrinsic motivation  can be invoked, there will be less anxiety and less fatigue  in the process of learning.  In Russells words, If the acquisition  of knowledge is felt as pleasure, it is likely to be continued  after the period of formal education is ended. And a universal  objective of education is that learning should be a life-long  process. A report to the United Nations educational, scientific  and cultural organization of the International Commission  on Education for the 21st century states, A key to the  21st century, learning throughout life will be essential  for adapting to the evolving requirements of the labour  market and for better mastery of the changing time-frames  and rhythms of individual existence. Every year, at the time of the  seasonal epidemic we express our shock at the crop of examination-related  suicides. Every year, at this time we felicitate our toppers  and ignore students who are intellectually imaginative,  intellectually adventurous and creative. Yet, every once  in a while the uncomfortable question is asked, Why dont  we produce thinkers and inventors any more? The answer  is: we do but they have to go abroad to discover this. We  are quick to claim Nobel, Booker and Pulitzer Prize winners  as our own on account of their Indian origin, but they  are certainly not a result of our examination system. It is because we do not promote  intrinsic motivation in education that we are failing to  establish standards of intellectual excellence. The emotional,  social, mental and physical strain of having to perform  in terms of marks is taking its toll. We are producing students  who are uninspired, cynical and conditioned to give the  right answers to right questions from the right books, whereas  from an early age they should be excited about learning  and be infused with enthusiasm for discovery and research.  They must be encouraged to demonstrate  intellectual initiative, ask questions fearlessly and make  mistakes fearlessly. They must be led to understand that  in many areas there are no right or wrong answers. In  short, they need to excel in their own way. But for all  this to happen, it is imperative that we free them from  intellectual slavery. The first step towards this end is  to change our method of assessment  unless of course we  wish to keep churning out assembly-line intellects.

		 Tuesday, May 27, 2003  REVISITING GOPALS NEHRU
 - The time may have come to view Nehrus deeds with detachment  RAMACHANDRA GUHA ramguhavsnl.com In literature, as in life, timing  is all. Published on the eve of the Cold War, George Orwells  Nineteen Eighty Four became a worldwide best-seller.  Decades before Orwell, the Russian writer, Zamyatin, had  written a powerful novel about totalitarianism called We.  But when this appeared, there were no signs of Hitler or  Stalin, no looming threats to civilization. And so Zamyatins  book sunk, unmourned. An Indian book that was somewhat  unfortunate in its timing was Sarvepalli Gopals biography  of Jawaharlal Nehru. Its three volumes were published between  1975 and 1984, that is, precisely when Nehrus daughter  Indira Gandhi was working overtime at demolishing the foundations  of Indian democracy. Intellectuals put off or harrassed  by Mrs Gandhi were in no mood to carefully read a book believed  to be in praise of her father. And so the word went round   this is a reverential, uncritical, book, a book by a courtier  about a monarch he worshipped. As a student in Calcutta  then, I swallowed the word myself. Not long ago, I read the three  volumes of Gopals biography for the first time. It did  have its faults, though these were not those indicated by  my teachers of twenty years ago. I was especially struck  by the lack of attention to Nehrus personal and emotional  life. Thus, his relationship with his wife is not fleshed  out in any detail. His relationships with other women are  not even commented upon. Edwina Mountbatten rates one mention  in a thousand pages of text. Padmaja Naidu is not even so  lucky. A more telling flaw, in what was  intended to be chiefly a political biography, is the prejudiced  treatment of those placed in positions of rivalry to Nehru.  Thus Subhas Bose, who in the Thirties was an alternate lodestar  for the patriotic-minded young, is called impatient, wilful  and endlessly ambitious. Boses book, The Indian Struggle,  says Gopal, lacks the intellectual grace and stature of  Jawaharlals (Autobiography). The ideas are jejune  and the prose without flavour. As for the man himself,  he was a born loser. Bose, fortunately for Nehru perhaps,  died in 1945. After independence, Nehrus chief rival,  in a political sense, was Rajendra Prasad. For twelve years,  president and prime minister had an uneasy relationship.  The Constitution envisaged a more active role for the president  than Nehru was prepared to allow. As Rajendra Prasads secretary,  C.S. Venkatachar, has commented, Outwardly there was deference  to the Presidents function; inwardly, they were ignored.  Venkatachar, and others, saw Prasad as a thoughtful if somewhat  conservative patriot, who could have moderated some of the  prime ministers more extreme views. But Gopal believes  that if Nehru did not more often consult the president,  it was because it wasnt worth it. Rajendra Prasad to him  was the meek follower of Gandhi, but untouched in any real  sense by the sprit of Gandhis teachings; a loyal party  man but of inferior intellectual quality and with a social  outlook which belonged to the eighteenth century. At another  place he says that the president was prominent in the ranks  of medievalism. Consider, finally, Gopals treatment  of C. Rajagopalachari. Rajaji worked closely with  Nehru in the early years after independence, but then the  two drifted apart. Later, they even became political adversaries  when the Tamil started the Swatantra Party and mounted a  telling critique of Nehrus economic policy. The Australian  diplomat, Walter Crocker, once remarked that Rajaji was  at least the intellectual and moral equal of Nehru. But  Gopal will have none of this. For him Rajaji was blinded  by personal chagrin. Deliberate perversity was a major  facet of his intellectual arrogance, while inconsistency  was to Rajago-pa-lachari always a cause of satisfaction. This, then, is a biography that  suppresses the personal life, and displays a sometimes unreasoning  hostility to its subjects colleagues and critics. Set against  these flaws are some very considerable virtues. For one,  it is an outcome of solid research. Gopal ploughed through  a mountain of letters and government documents, and also  read widely in the contemporary periodical literature. For  another, it is artfully and even elegantly written. For  a third, it is as much a portrait of the times as of the  individual. This aspect of Gopals book is particularly  valuable, for there are no credible histories of India after  independence. Other historians treat August 15, 1947 as  a sort of lakshman rekha: they always stay on the  colonial side of the divide. Gopals book, however, is richly  informative about the economic and foreign policies followed  by the government of free India. Last and certainly not the least  among the books virtues is that it is by no means a hagiography.  While sympathetic to Nehru, it does not elevate him to icon-like  status. Gopal makes it clear that Mahatma Gandhi was much  the greater man. Unlike the Mahatma, Nehru was not capable  of deep or original thought, and he knew it. Again, unlike  Gandhi, who was a strong man, imparting strength to others,  Nehru drew sustenance from popular idolatry. Gopal criticizes  Nehrus lack of judgment, pointing out that he had a weakness  for flamboyant buccaneers, such as Pratap Singh Kairon  and Krishna Menon, who did him (and India) poorly. That  a stenographer named M.O. Matthai became so powerful was  in part the fault of the boss himself: an illiterate upstart  had succeeded in making Nehru the victim of his own isolation  and had revived in Delhi the atmosphere of a decadent court. Most significantly, Gopal does  not shirk from the criticism of Nehru the administrator  and policymaker. If Nehru seems a prophet frustrated and  with his hopes unfulfilled, he writes, then the cause  lies in the failures to follow up the courageous introduction  of adult suffrage with a speedy enforcement of land distribution  and tenancy reforms, a proper emphasis on education, a revision  of the administrative apparatus and control of the population.  Had these steps been taken, democracy would have been accompanied  by basic changes in society and the Fifties would not appear  more and more of a faded golden age. Nehru, we complain, could have  done more. But he did a huge amount as it is. With Patel,  Rajaji, Ambedkar and others, he united India peacably and  gave it a democratic Constitution. These others contributed,  sometimes mightily, but as the head of government for a  full seventeen years, Nehru contributed most of all. He  was, in Gopals words, the national appeaser, enclosing  various conflicting elements in a broad pattern of agreement.  It was his ability to transcend the confines of region,  religion, caste and language, his ability to reach out to  all of India, that made Gandhi designate him his  successor above the other, more ethnically bounded, contenders.  As the historian, Robert D. King, has written, Nehru was  an extremely intelligent man whose education and experience  had elevated him to a height from which he could judge his  countrys problems without the regional prejudices and small-mindedness  many of his fellow leaders brought with them when they assumed  power in the wake of the British withdrawal. King also observes how fortunate  India was to have had Jawaharlal Nehru as its guide and  preceptor during the years of the creation of independent  India. Perhaps it takes a foreigner to be so discerningly  generous. We Indians are more judgmental: for, as Gopal  himself puts it, Nehrus very achievements demand that  he be judged by standards which one would not apply to the  ordinary run of prime ministers; and disappointment stems  from the force of our expectations. But, with Nehru and  Mrs Gandhi both long dead, the time may have come for us  to view both his achievements and failures with the necessary  detachment. Sarvepalli Gopals still readable, still unequalled,  three-volume biography would be a very good place to start.

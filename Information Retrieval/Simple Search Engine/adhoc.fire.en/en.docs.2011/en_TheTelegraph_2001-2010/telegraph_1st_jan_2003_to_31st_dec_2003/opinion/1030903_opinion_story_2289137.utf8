The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, September 03, 2003  BEAT THE SYSTEM
 Reena Sen argues that teachers  have a major responsibility in the review and reform of the  current system of education in India The author is deputy director and  head, training and research, Indian Institute of Cerebral  Palsy, Calcutta		 Give them all a chanceA few weeks ago, I went for an  evening show and hoped to spend two hours switched off  from the rest of the world. But every few minutes, mobile  phones made their ubiquitous presence felt. When I protested,  I was told by people younger than my own children to chill.  They were from rich homes and the fluency with which they  spoke the Queens language indicated education in private,  English medium schools. Yet their behaviour was worse than  the so-called paan-wallah crowd on the groundfloor  of the cinema hall. It is simplistic to blame schools  for student-behaviour as adolescence and peer pressure spur  people on to inconceivable levels of foolhardiness and irreverence.  But perhaps this is a good time to reflect on school education,  value systems and what appear to be perceptible outcomes  of education. What are we doing to make teaching worthwhile,  to create an intrinsic motivation towards the enhancement  of knowledge?  There is no lack of discussion  on these issues, but these usually end up romanticizing  the old days, eulogizing teachers and masters and laying  the blame on the system. But we need to realize that the  system is all of us put together. We have to accept that  as members of the teaching profession we have something  to do with what has gone wrong, just as it is our collective  responsibility to set the system right. Today, education is measured by  rank, job, salary and material possessions. The pursuit  of education and the development of wisdom have not, necessarily,  meant the same thing. This is evident from the conduct of  the so-called educated who have ruthlessly propagated  class, caste and gender inequality and have used their position  to control, dominate and sometimes, abuse. Education now  is about possession, power and a tool for creating an underclass. Nowhere is this more evident than  in our private English-medium school system. English-medium  education is seen as a passport to success. The need for  change, for review and reform diminishes as a long waiting  list ensures that empty places are always filled, a child  withdrawn is easily replaced, a piqued parent silenced by  others who are satisfied. I am a product of this system,  but the real lessons about life were learnt in university,  when I met better and brighter students from less glamorous  schools. Further lessons were learnt in my years working  with children with disabilities, meeting their families  and learning about courage and conviction. More recently,  as a teacher coordinating a service for children from normal  mainstream schools facing learning and other difficulties,  I regularly witness the trauma and anxiety of children,  hear the desperate pleas for help from adults as schools  issue warnings about withdrawal, observe children stuttering  and stammering with nervousness.  What makes the system what it  is? The answer probably lies in our search for success.  The rat race starts with the process of selecting children  who perform in the interview, have the potential to be  achievers, have the capacity to win accolades for the school.  Advantages lie in having parents who are achievers and can  speak English. The period before the child gets into school  is fraught with stress. The day the child gets into school  calls for a family celebration. Then reality bites! In the classroom, all knowledge  of child development, psychological theories of the intelligence  curve, information processing and overload, positive reinforcement  and rewards are forsaken. The child is expected to behave  like a miniature adult. Woe betide the child who cannot  understand why he must sit and write pages of what appears  meaningless to him, or if he cannot understand or speak  English. Parents are called in, told to control their child,  sometimes even sent for an assessment to a psychologist  or a child guidance expert.  As children grow, schooling emphasizes  over and over again that achievement and success are all  that matter. The bright and clever students are the ones  who become captains and prefects, the best players get to  the field, the best debater represents the school. The ones  who are average never get to know the feeling of pride associated  with representing the school. The school is happy to take  the credit for the students performance and shrugs off  the responsibility for failure or lack of achievement, blaming  it on parents.  Parent-teacher meetings for all  but achievers are an exercise in humiliation. As a parent  I have been ticked off by teachers for being a bad mother,  for my childs lack of effort. All this in spite of having  two girls who in school were above-average in academics,  although they did not always live up to expectations.  Parents undoubtedly have a large role to play in the system.  They want their children to be successful, rich and famous;  they constantly compare one child with another, and seem  to realize their own dreams and aspirations vicariously  through their children.  In the midst of this performance-oriented  paranoia, the lot of the average and the below-average student  is pathetic. We talk about multiple intelligences but in  practice the factor is never taken into consideration. How  is it that a child poor in academics is never in the limelight?  Why does a child have to resort to attention-seeking strategies  that develop into challenging behaviours? Why dont children  with, say, a language delay, a learning deficit, a physical  or sensory loss get admission into regular schools for normal  children? Schools plead their inability to cater to these  children due to paucity of resources, crowded classes, lack  of specially trained teachers. But what prevents fee-charging  schools from employing special educators to cater to the  needs of students who need some degree of extra support?  The answer lies in schools wanting  to be known as institutions producing first divisioners  with the potential of being leaders or professionals. If  education were to be identified with value-based learning,  enhancement of wisdom and enlightenment, schools would automatically  be more inclusive, dedicated to providing learning opportunities  to all children.  Is it unreasonable to want schools  to become better teaching-learning spaces for all  children? No. There are already a few private schools that  share this vision and have taken steps to be more inclusive  in their policies and practices. Ironically, in the issue  of school reform the government schools are winning hands  down. Thanks to schemes like the district primary education  project with the Integrated Education for Disabled Children  scheme, positive steps have been taken, particularly in  states like Andhra Pradesh. Delhi state schools are now  open to all children and each school is supposed to have  at least one specially qualified teacher to support children  with special educational needs. The Sarva Shikshya Abhiyan,  slowly being implemented in all states, advocates a zero-rejection  policy in schools and applies to all government schools.  Private schools may choose to remain outside this unless  there is public pressure. As citizens, as teachers, it is  now up to us to reflect, to review, to garner resources  within the teaching community to change the system. As Teachers  Day approaches, let us, teachers, take a pledge to work  together to make our schools produce free souls, good human  beings and responsible citizens.

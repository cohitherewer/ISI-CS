 															- Document  Extracts from the UNDP report, HIV/AIDS  and Development in South Asia 2003				 	 Picture imperfect																								Impact of HIV on human development: The HIV/AIDS epidemic has profound consequences for human development in south Asia. This is because HIV affects not just the health of individuals, but has both a direct and indirect effect on their capabilities, their family and kinship structures, and consequently, on the economic, social and institutional arrangements. These nuanced effects of HIV make it imperative to look at it from a development perspective, rather than a purely public health one. It is also important that the impact be examined primarily through the individuals and households it affects, using a human development framework. Such a broader approach is more conducive to the prevention and management of the epidemic, a combination of which would reverse the incidence.																								Impact of HIV on different dimensions of human development: Human development is, very simply, the process of enlarging choices. The human development framework looks at how these choices are enlarged by enhancing the capabilities of individuals, and at the outcomes of these enlarged choices...																								Incomes, poverty and earning capabilities: There are several ways in which individuals and their households are likely to be economically affected by AIDS. The most visible and immediate impact is on the earnings and incomes of households of People Living With HIV/AIDS, especially since HIV affects individuals in their most productive years. ...More than 90 per cent of the worlds PLWHA are in the age group of 15-49 years. This group is likely to be part of the labour force, or provide in-kind support to the household. The impact can take the form of lost earnings when individuals are sick or die prematurely due to AIDS. In south Asia, the earnings losses are staggering. Bloom and Mahal (1996) estimate that in Sri Lanka, lost lifetime earnings due to an AIDS death were nearly eleven times the annual treatment costs. In Nepal, they suggest that similar losses were more than four times the per capita income. Prolonged illness also results in loss in savings and asset holdings, both due to an increase in costs, as well as a decrease in the propensity to save due to lower life expectancy.																								A second...impact is the change in the disposable income because of increased expenditure on treatment. Several studies have documented the costs of treatment as being more than twice the per capita incomes in selected Asian countries. In India, for instance, the ratio of treatment costs to per capita income was 2.2 while in Sri Lanka it was 1.5. These estimates did not include the costs of anti-retroviral drugs, which could be expected to further push up the economic burden on families and households.																								Loss of incomes and earnings can also occur due to the loss of a job because of the stigma associated with HIV infection, even if the HIV-positive individual is not laid up with any of the opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS, in these cases, the discounted value of lost earnings is even greater than in the case of an AIDS death, because treatment costs are incurred without any income being earned. It is apparent that the loss of a job for a young adult has negative economic and, possibly, psychological consequences both for PLWHA and their dependants. It is not the consequences of job loss, however, but the relationship between an individuals HIV-status and and job loss that is of concern here. 																								A Mumbai-based NGO in India took up the case of an individual who was dismissed from a public sector company after being found to be HIV-positive during medical fitness tests that included testing his blood for HIV, without obtaining prior consent...This discrimination is not confined to south Asia but exists in many other countries as well.

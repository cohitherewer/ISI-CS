		 Saturday, November 29, 2003  BAD TIMES DOWN UNDER
 - We go there, we get walloped, and we return  Politics and Play / Ramachandra  Guha ramguhavsnl.com Vinoo Mankad  Fifty-four years ago, John Arlott  succintly defined a cricketing phenomenon he termed Australianism.  Any national side playing the baggy green caps, said Arlott,  was faced with Australian batting, bowling, fielding, captaincy,  and Australianism. Australianism means single-minded  determination to win  to win within the laws but, if necessary,  to the last limit within them. It means that where the impossible  is within the realm of what the human body can do, there  are Australians who believe that they can to it and  who have succeeded often enough to make us wonder if anything  is impossible to them. It means that they have never lost  a match  particularly a test match  until the last run  is scored or their last wicket has fallen. The first Indians to encounter  this phenomenon in full force were Lala Amarnaths touring  side of 1947-8. The country had just won its independence;  but against the background of a bloody partition. Conditions  were terribly unsettled. This was reflected in the composition  of the team that finally went. Indias greatest batsman,  Vijay Merchant, dropped out for family reasons. His celebrated  opening partner, Mushtaq Ali, was caught in riots in Indore  and could not join the team when picked. The off-spinner,  Ghulam Ahmad, was marooned in Hyderabad, whose Nizam was  refusing to join the Indian Union. And another gifted cricketer,  the Bombay batsman, Russi Modi, was unavailable through  injury. With these four players, India  might have put up a decent fight; without them there was  no hope of that either. We lost the series four-nil. A simple  statistic conveys the staggering imbalance between the two  sides. Whereas Australia scored an average of 47. 54 runs  for every wicket lost, India averaged a mere 19.55 runs  per wicket. All the fans could do was to take consolation  in individual achievement. In Baroda, they spoke thus of  Hazares hundred in each innings at Adelaide, while in Jamnagar  they revelled in Vinoo Mankads two centuries, opening the  batting against Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. The Bengalis too had something  to celebrate. Thus the Kalighat Club in Calcutta organized  a felicitation for the Indian teams wicket-keeper, P. (Khokon)  Sen. Here, the clubs president presented the cricketer  with a silver salver, in recognition of his sterling work  behind the stumps in the tests at Adelaide and Melbourne.  In each of these two matches Australia had batted just once,  scoring 674 and 575 for 8 declared respectively. But in  those two mammoth scores there had been only 12 byes all  told. The bowling had been indifferent, the fielding below  par, but the man behind the stumps had displayed unflagging  zeal and concentration. Sens work had brought glory to  Kalighat, to Bengal and to India. Thus said the club president,  and thus too thought the clubs members. In his reply, Khokhon  Sen said that while he was mindful of the honour done him,  he would like to point out that in all those hours behind  the wicket, only five balls had passed the bat. The most recent Indian side to  encounter Australi- anism was the one that played the  TVS-series cup final at the Eden Gardens on November 18.  The home side lacked its captain, Sourav Ganguly; but the  visitors were without its four finest bowlers. This was  a handicap that would have crippled any other cricket team.  Yet, throughout this tournament, the Australians played  with imperious arrogance. The only time they were in any  kind of trouble was in the final, when after Gilchrist and  Hayden had failed to fire they ended with what  for them   was an altogether modest score of 235. On a slow, low  wicket  the kind our batsmen are brought up on  we should  have been clear favourites. Yet from the first ball of the  Indian innings, it was clear that their opponents thought  otherwise. The great Sachin Tendulkar was bottled up by  accurate bowling and outstanding fielding; it took him eleven  overs to hit his first boundary. Slowly, he found his touch,  as did his partner, Rahul Dravid. Just when it looked as  if the initiative had swung away from Australia, they got  rid of Sachin. Dravid continued with his characteristic  calm assurance; and Badani batted bravely. India once again  looked on top. But the visitors kept chipping away, their  resolve and persistence finding its reward in the end. Australian cricketers play above  themselves abroad; and they play above themselves at home.  In nearly sixty years of trying, India still hasnt won  a series Down Under. (By contrast, we have won series in  England, the West Indies and New Zealand.) In 1967-8, we  lost four-nil. When we toured again ten years later, the  home side had lost its best players to the cheque book of  Mr Kerry Packer. But, as in India in 2003, their places  were taken by young and ferociously competitive reserves.  To lead them the Australians had called the veteran, Bobby  Simpson, out of retirement. Chandrasekhar and Bedi bowled  well, Gavaskar batted beautifully, but still, the best Indian  side could not beat a second-string Australian team. We  won our first two tests Down Under, yet they won the other  three. The Packer rebellion ended, leaving  Australian cricket in a state of disrepair. The early Eighties  were unquestionably the lowest point in that nations cricketing  history. They lost regularly to the West Indies, and even  (God forbid!) to England. It was in these years that India  came closest to winning a series in Australia. In the winter  of 1980-81, we drew a three-match series one-all, our victory  coming in Melbourne, in a match remembered for an exquisite  hundred by Gundappa Viswanath, for a threatened walk-out  by Sunil Gavaskar, and for a marvellous match-winning spell  by a heavily strapped Kapil Dev. Five years later, we toured Australia  again. The first test was a dreary draw, but in the second  match we had much the better hand. We went in to bat halfway  through the last day, needing a mere 126 runs to win. We  had reached 59 for 2 by tea, but then a freak thunderstorm  prevented further play. In the third and final test, India  scored 600 for 4, batting first, and made Australia follow-on.  On this occasion, victory was denied us, not by the weather  but by the shocking partisanship of the home umpires. The victory of Alan Borders side  in the 1987 World Cup was the beginning of the renewal of  Australian cricket. In the winter of 1991-92, India was  granted a five-match series for the first time since 1947.  The result was exactly the same, four matches lost, one  drawn. Consolation came in a hundred hit by the captain,  Mohammed Azharuddin, in a double hundred hit by Ravi Shastri,  and (especially) in the two separate hundreds hit by the  18-year-old Sachin Tendulkar. Eight years later, when India  toured again, the boy had become a man. He batted bravely,  as did V.V.S. Laxman, yet we lost all three matches we played. This historical retrospective  points to a fundamental and seemingly near-permanent asymmetry  between India abroad and Australia at home. We go there,  we get walloped, and we return. It will be no different  this time. In 1947, the Indian captain, Lala Amarnath, did  not have four of his best players. This winter Sourav Ganguly  has precisely the men he wanted. Moreover, his side is not  unduly short of self-belief. It has some fine batsmen, an  outstanding coach, and the most non-parochial skipper since  Tiger Pataudi. What it lacks is quality bowlers. After the touring party was announced,  Ganguly expressed regret that room could not be found in  the side for Murali Kartik. I wonder if he, or John Wright,  had read the scores of previous tours before the selection  committee meeting. They would have found that our spinners  Down Under have generally outperformed our fast bowlers.  (Still the finest bowling performance by an Indian in Australia  is Erapalli Prasannas 25 wickets in the 4 tests of 1967-8.)  I think we should have gambled and taken one more slow bowler  and one less seamer. Then we might have had an outside chance  of winning one test; now, we should count ourselves fortunate  if we do not lose all four. I am a historian and not an astrologer.  I still do not see any victory celebrations in India at  the end of our tour of Australia. The most one can hope  for is a fitting ceremony in Mohun Bagan Club, this to honour  an individual who, in the face of the galloping gale known  as Australianism, would have yet kept his reputation and  honour intact.

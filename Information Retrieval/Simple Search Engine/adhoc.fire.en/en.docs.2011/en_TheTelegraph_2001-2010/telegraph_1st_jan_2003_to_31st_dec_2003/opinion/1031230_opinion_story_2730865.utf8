		 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 COMING: A HAPPY NEW YEAR
 Mani Talk Mani / Shankar Aiyar				 	 Still flying high																								Writing, wrote Hazlitt, concentrates the mind wonderfully. Defeat does so even more wonderfully. Even while those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad, so as the Bharatiya Janata Party reels drunken with triumphalism over its upset victory in three north Indian states, those who understand that 2004 is to India what 1932 was to Germany are getting their act together. The year will not be a personality contest between an octogenarian, stumbling, bumbling incumbent prime minister and his young challenger, as the BJP strangely wishes, but between a six-year old alliance tried and found wanting, on the one hand, and a coalition of secularists determined to preserve the essential nationhood of modern India, on the other. Who will be prime minister? gets relegated to page 3 as the nation decides whether it wants to remain itself or get soaked in saffron.																								Of course, the upcoming secular alliance, like all new alliances, is a coming together of parties with deep differences. Thus, secularists are pitted against each other in West Bengal, Tripura and Kerala, but the good news is that whichever of the contenders gets elected, it is the alternative coalition to the National Democratic Alliance that wins. There are states where Congress dominance is assured  Karnataka is the obvious example, Meghalaya is another  where the BJP virtually does not exist and other opponents are on the same side as the Congress on the principle of secularism. In Himachal and Uttaranchal, the Congress has already toppled the BJP citadel. In Jharkhand, it is poised to do the same. In states where the Congress is already in coalition  Jammu and Kashmir, Maharashtra, Manipur spring to mind  it is the consolidation of existing partnerships rather than the search for new friends that is the need of the hour. In Andhra Pradesh, alliance-building had already commenced when it seemed the state might go to the polls before the Lok Sabha elections, a possibility which still looks probable. To a very great extent, it is not the BJP but its surrogates who are the challenge in Bihar, Orissa, Assam, Sikkim, Arunachal, Nagaland and Mizoram. 																								The NDA in these states is more a manifestation of visceral anti-Congressism than communalism gone rampant. Some of these surrogates are irredeemable. Others less so. In a vast swathe extending from Punjab through Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh, both the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party have influence, the latter perhaps more than the former in UP, but the former certainly more than the latter in other states of this region. Whether they can sink their internal differences is the moot question, but both are indubitably secular. In Tamil Nadu, where regional parties dominate the political scene, it is not the BJP but the Congress that tilts the balance in favour of the Dravidian party that puts together the winning rainbow combination. In Pondicherry, the Congress is predominant but can always do with a little help from the partys Tamil Nadu partner. Goa remains a close call, Gujarat a severe challenge. 																								In the Union territories, the BJP last time won only the Andaman amp; Nicobar islands, the Congress taking Lakshadweep, Chandigarh, and Diu-Daman. Dadra-Nagar Haveli was snatched by an outside supporter of the NDA. In sum, BJP triumphalism is wholly misplaced. They are blowing their victory conches when they should be sounding the Last Post. Battle is joined. The year 2004 promises to be one of the most exciting and closely fought elections ever.																								The rationale for entering the lists as two alliances rather than two parties is obvious. The BJP on its own is as far from 300 seats as the Congress on its own is from 272. The BJP put its principles and programme on the back-burner to cobble together a coalition of opportunists. The Congress, on the other, is putting its principles on the front-burner, and on the back-burner its differences with those who share its secular vision. In other words, where the BJP sacrificed its purpose to come to power any which way, the Congress is staking its most strongly-held principle to bring to power those who have always opposed it. The goal is much larger than electoral victory. The aim is to restore the countrys millennial ethos of inclusive nationalism, which the sangh parivar and its stalking horses in government have been insidiously undermining over the last six years and will do so uninhibitedly if M. Venkaiah Naidus fantasies were ever to be realized.																								It is the fact that it is an alliance of principle that will make the drafting of a common agenda easier for the alternative alliance than it was for the NDA. The NDA had to first decide what not to include (the entire BJP agenda, bag and baggage) before it could work out what to put in. The new alliance, on the other hand, is coming together essentially to promote secularism and oppose communalism. So, the theme of the agenda is clear. Clearly, the rest of the agenda will have to distinguish this alliance from the NDA on such crucial matters as the role of the state in engendering employment and alleviating poverty; food security for BPL families; the use of foodgrains buffer stocks for disaster relief; panchayati raj (grassroots development through grassroots democracy); the role of the public sector in relation to disinvestment; and effective regulation, not the crony capitalism so evident in telecom and capital markets. 																								Overarching all these will be the question of unemployment. Notwithstanding its empty slogan of berozgari hatao, the six years of NDA rule have been years of disaster on the employment front. The officials gallery have misled the prime minister over the net growth of employment by giving him the figures for the gross increase. Since the prime minister is as innocent of sound statistics as he is of good poetry, the poor man has ended misleading the House. His ministers know this. So they flounder when asked. The recent 57th round of the National Sample Survey Organization reconfirms the nations worst apprehensions in this regard. The economic and social agenda of the new alliance will, therefore, have to be progressive. Its focus could be that development may be measured by the rate of growth of GDP, but welfare is determined foremost by the rate of growth of employment. Jobless growth of the NDA kind must give way to the growth of employment pari passu with the economy. The foundation could be the Shimla Shivir slogan of Congress ka haath, garibon ke saath, changed perhaps to SPA ka haath, garibon ke saath if my suggestion of the name Secular Progressive Alliance is accepted.																								It sure is gonna be a Happy New Year!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 11, 2003  SO MANY SAVING GRACES
 The mere comparison of 1922 to 1992,  writes Janaki Nair, certainly cannot invest Advanis  message with the moral authority of Gandhis  The author is a senior fellow in history,  Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta The small matter  of evidence  Historians are by far the most  beleaguered professionals in India today. For a while now,  we had been told by those envisioning a bright, new, technocratized  future that disciplines such as history are increasingly  irrelevant to the production of technocrats and computer  professionals, and are only a frustrating drag on the speed  with which India could take its place as an information  superpower. The ink-stained breast pocket might once have  earned admiration, if not respect. No more. The new badge  of honour is the information technology company lanyard,  emblematic of the new world order even when it is stuffed  into a breast pocket. Now the historian herself joins the  dusty shelf of antiquities and defiantly dull dissertations.  The prospect of harnessing this unencashable discipline  to more productive uses briefly brought a gleam back to  the eyes of those who saw tour operators as fitter users  of such knowledge, and in some universities, tourism is  indeed yoked to the teaching of history.  But of late, it is not neglect  that threatens the discipline as much as unwelcome attention  to the practice of history. Rather like the guest who overstays  his welcome, and even evicts the unsuspecting host from  her house, there has been an exploitation of historys legendary  hospitality. Other practices and institutions challenge,  rather than enrich, the field and are trying to reconstitute  it in ways that not only threaten the occupants but the  edifice itself. The practice of History, we are told in  a hundred new ways, is too important to be left to the professional  historian alone.  So it is with trepidation that  we respond to the new attention. Most recently, Swapan Dasgupta,  a historian who forsook the dreary profession for the excitement  of the print media, has made the passionate argument that  the nobler court of History, rather than the tawdry hall  of justice, may be the more appropriate place for the trial  of someone such as Lal Krishna Advani and his role in the  events leading to the demolition of the Babri Masjid on  that unforgettable day in December 1992. In his passionate  assertion of Advanis credentials as a man with morals,  and even  who would have suspected?  such sentiments as  remorse, Dasgupta offers what should be a most persuasive  device: the first person account. As an eyewitness to not  just the demolition of the masjid but to the many  unverifiable moods of Advani, Dasgupta suggests that the  man widely regarded as the strategic brain of the National  Democratic Alliance  and here the admiration is unconcealed   could not have been part of a criminal conspiracy to demolish  the masjid, as claimed in the tendentious, and politically  mischievous, cases filed before the courts.  On the strictly technical aspects  of the court case, Dasgupta may well be right. He is amply  aided by the Central Bureau of Investigations notorious  ability to let corporate criminals, expatriate dons, and  assorted demagogic and scandal-tainted politicians go scot  free, by providing no supporting evidence of criminal conspiracy  involving the top leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party.  (This should not detract from the agencys brilliant skills  in constructing an entire scaffolding, resting on a mere  telephone call, on which a hapless university lecturer will  swing.)  But Dasgupta takes the ineptness  of the CBI as fit occasion to redeem the image of a dangerous  demagogue. Advanis 1990 rathyatra left a trail of  death and destruction, (stopped in its tracks only by the  much maligned Laloo) and set the ball rolling for the acts  of a murderous majority from which the entire Indian nation  is still reeling. True, the writer does suggest, in one  paragraph at the end of the article, that Advani must claim  moral responsibility for the series of disastrous events,  but not before darkly hinting that the charge of conspiracy  must first be laid at someone elses door.  The paths of the judge and the  historian, as Carlo Ginsburg has told us, do indeed converge,  but only up to a point. Both rely on evidence, and the skills  of argument, to reconstruct events and produce truth. But  the responsibilities of a judge are far more onerous, since  what she must deliver is justice, and a judicial error is  unforgivable. This does not reduce the responsibilities  of historians or even of eyewitness accounts. Though a historian,  I did not have the advantage of a ringside view, so I can  only raise some questions of Dasguptas text.  Throughout the piece, we are repeatedly  persuaded of the authenticity of his account by the liberal  use of such terms as my experience I witnessed and (Advani)  told me. But Dasgupta would be the first to cast some doubt  on the sudden explosion of other eyewitnesses, indeed participants,  who are clamouring to testify that senior leaders egged  them on. And no less than a former member of the BJP, Kalyan  Singh, has said as much. What, if anything, is the weight  of this evidence? Moreover, could Advani, given his intelligence  of which the writer is so obviously in thrall, have mistaken  the kar sevaks armed with pickaxes for peaceful  demonstrators who only wanted to realize the dream of the  greatest mass movement he had so assiduously helped build  (and indeed what was that dream if not the forcible occupation  of a place of worship?) Assuming that he did not actually  egg the kar sevaks on, did Dasgupta witness Advani make  any attempt to use oratory skills to persuade them against  demolition? (Descending to a room to make phone calls is  no act of moral daring in such circumstances.) In such a  situation, does culpability remain only moral? In his account, Dasgupta takes  us through the moods of a political leader who is struck  successively by absolute panic, then anger and finally  one distraught, almost in tears who had clearly lost control  over the programme of hate he had sculpted. Hence we are  told of his complete disorientation when presented with  the Ram lalla by a bloodstained (note the adjective)  kar sevak. One does not want to credit Advani with fine  acting skills, but surely in the company of leading journalists  his behaviour is somewhat modified. But there is an unusual  frankness about the real concern during the moment of madness:  the state government of Kalyan Singh is endangered, and  Advani retrieves some moral ground by asking him to quit.  Dasgupta thus serves his political  masters well by himself inaugurating the historical rewriting  of this moment. He does this through such breathtaking statements  of a helpless Advani who was devoured by a revolution he  helped create. If the rich political capital garnered from  such brutalities did not make of Advani the deputy prime  minister that he is today, this eyewitness account would  have been easier to swallow.  But perhaps the most predictable  attempt to produce the softer image of the Iron Man is  the comparison with a memorable Gandhian moment, when the  apostle of non-violence was shaken by the violent acts that  were undertaken in his name at Chauri Chaura in 1922. Many  historians have affirmed that the message of Mohandas Karamchand  Gandhi was not always in his control, and indeed interpreted  at the grassroots to address all kinds of local grievances.  Chauri Chaura became a turning point in the non-cooperation  movement (and it was called off). Advani cannot ever be  accused of having preached non-violence, not even by eyewitnesses,  and the mere comparison of 1922 to 1992 certainly cannot  invent the moral authority of Gandhi for Advanis murderous  message. We must remind ourselves of this repeatedly, for  otherwise, as Walter Benjamin warned us from his encounters  with Fascism, even the dead will not be safe from those  who are allowed to triumph.

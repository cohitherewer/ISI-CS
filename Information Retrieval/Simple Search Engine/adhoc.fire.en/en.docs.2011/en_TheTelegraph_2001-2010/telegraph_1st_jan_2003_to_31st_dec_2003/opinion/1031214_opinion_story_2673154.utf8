				 																																																																														 Sushma Swaraj, it appears, has not got over her childhood love for fancy dress. On Karva Chauth every year, the minister for parliamentary affairs loves to dress up as a bride  shiny Christmas-tree baubles and a more-than-usually-thick band of sindoor on her forehead. Last Tuesday was not Karva Chauth but it was no less festive. With the BJP notching a huge victory in the state elections, Sushmaji obviously felt something symbolic and special was called for. And indeed she couldnt have chosen better than a combination of the traditional attires of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh  two states where the BJP victory was particularly emphatic. Unfortunately, when she entered Parliament annexe, few people knew it was her because her face was covered with a long Rajasthani chunri and she had to lift the ghunghat for people to recognize her. Sushmaji was not done with dressing up  she followed it up with a little production. She did a little aarti of the three new CMs and put tikka on their foreheads, while Satya Narain Jatiya sang Sanskrit shlokas as accompaniment. So overwhelmed was Sushmaji with emotion that she burst into tears while embracing Uma Bharti and Vasundhara Raje. Sceptics, of course, say that the emotion that prompted the tears was not happiness but more like self-pity for having missed the bus  had luck favoured her, she could have been a CM much before these two. Politicians are such cynics!				 																																																																														 Victory has not improved Uma Bhartis temper or her manners. An FIR has been lodged in Mathura against Madhya Pradeshs new CM for slapping a photographer and misbehaving with journalists. Thats not all  she was ungracious enough to not invite senior party colleague and Union minister, Sumitra Mahajan, to her swearing-in just because the latter was AB Vajpayees candidate for the same post. The only ones Bharti is polite to nowadays are the sadhus (among her first callers was Chandraswami, in the news some time back for his disreputable connections) and animals  the sanyasin has ordered a census of all donkeys, dogs, cows, goats in the state. Talk of misplaced priorities! 				 																																																																														 Salaried people, angry at having to give up a huge chunk of their pay cheques to the income tax people, can take heart. Next years budget promises to bring relief. With general elections scheduled for early next year, the BJP top brass wants a soft budget full of sops to keep the babu-class happy. The party has developed a new appreciation for this class ever since Pramod Mahajan cashed in on its resentment against Ashok Gehlot to win in Rajasthan. So if the exemption limit is raised to Rs 1 lakh, remember you first heard it here.				 																																																																														 If victory makes one arrogant, defeat can make one despondent. At a farewell dinner for journalists, Digvijay Singh found that no one was sitting next to him. The dejected outgoing CM of Madhya Pradesh remembered the times when these very mediamen vied to seek transfers, houses and other favours from him. But, Thats politics, as Singh was heard commenting philosophically to someone. 				 																																													Also, one defeat does not mean the end of the world. The buzz in the Congress is that Sonia Gandhi is planning to induct Diggy raja into the AICC as its G-sec in charge of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar  the two states in the Hindi heartland that have become a distant dream for the party. Victory would have limited the raja of Raghogarh to MP; defeat, it seems, is going to fulfil his long-cherished dream of making it in national politics.				 																																																																														 The BJP is targetting 300 plus in next years general polls, while the Congress will make do with a modest 200 seats. But the ones most excited at the elections are Chandrashekhar, IK Gujral, VP Singh and Sharad Pawar, who have been meeting one another, holding secret and not-so-secret meetings with the likes of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ajit Singh, discussing the various permutations and combinations of a future government. Each of them wants to be PM but theyll have to contend with the other PMs-in-waiting  N Chandrababu Naidu and George Fernandes. If only wishes were horses...				 																																																																														 From the crowds thronging 10 Janpath on December 9, Sonia Gandhis bday, the flowers, sweets and the cake, no one would guess that the Congress had suffered a crashing defeat in three states a few days ago. The only person left out was Ajit Jogi, who sat in 7 South Avenue, bouquet in hand, waiting for madams call. All his pleas to Ahmad Patel fell on deaf ears. Further, he was warned that if he tried to gatecrash, it would make matters worse.				 																																																																														 Those whom the gods want to destroy, they first make...foolish. Or Ajit Jogi would never have chosen Virendra Pandey as his mole to split the Jharkhand BJP. A bachelor and a disciplined RSS pracharak for over four decades, Pandey didnt even have the money to pay his phone bills. His phone  the one on which he tape-recorded the fateful conversation with Jogi  had been cut off and no outgoing calls could be made on it. Even the tape-recorder did not belong to Pandey  it was borrowed from a middle-level policeman who had a grouse against Jogi. Later, after he had done the impossible  exposed Jogis high moral ground after the Dilip Singh Judeo-affair  Pandey joked to his mates in the BJP that he could easily have kept the first instalment of Rs 25 lakh that Ram Khunte, the go-between, had delivered and surrendered only the Rs 20 lakh second instalment to the party. It would not have hurt the bribery case against Jogi, but it surely would have removed his poverty for life. And at the very least, he could have paid off his telephone arrears!

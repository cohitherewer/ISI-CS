		 Monday, December 15, 2003  FEEL GOOD, BUT NOT BETTER
 - Indias forex reserves must be turned into a tool to spur  growth  S. Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India A mid-year review of the Indian  economy was recently presented by the government of India.  It added to the feel-good factor in the economy by improving  on earlier predictions of the rate of growth of gross domestic  product this year, pitching it at above 7 per cent, thanks  especially to the turnaround expected in agriculture, due  to the better than expected monsoons, as also the industrial  sector. It is not yet time for celebration.  The rise in growth estimates of India has been against the  perspective of rising rates of growth elsewhere. The global  economy as a whole is growing again, with indications of  growth pick-up in the United States of America. So too,  the figures of growth in China and other east Asian countries  should serve to remind us of the distance yet untravelled.  China, according to estimates published by J. P. Mortan-Chase  clocked an annualized rate of growth of 18 per cent in the  first quarter of the year. So too, Taiwan and Singapore  registered rates of growth of 15 per cent. Now that other  countries are doing better, we should not rest on our oars. The survey being one of a series  mandated by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management  Act, its focus is rightly on the fiscal situation. The outcome  of fiscal deficit to GDP in 2002-03 was worse at 5.9 per  cent than what was expected earlier (5.5 per cent). Part  of the reason was the decline in revenues consequent on  the drought and increase in drought-related expenditure. The first half of the current  year shows an optimistic outlook in respect of the growth  of revenues. Gross tax revenues have shown a spurt in the  second quarter, growing by nearly 70 per cent from Rs 34,000  crore in the first quarter to Rs 60,000 crore in the next.  Direct taxes also registered a sharp jump by 22 per cent  over the same period of last year. Corporate taxes have  shown an increase of 30 per cent. Equally impressive is  the record of collections of service tax, growing by nearly  50 per cent over the same period last year. Non-tax revenues  have shown a lower rate of growth, due to a lower Reserve  Bank of India contribution. On the side of expenditure, there  is a continuing trend of increase. One, however, misses  a detailed analysis of the contributory factors to this  increase, although the review touches on the growth of subsidies.  What measures are under contemplation to bring this under  check is not discussed. One looks in vain for any discussion  of this potential problem, apart from broad suggestions  that measures are under way or under discussion. Following  the experience in previous years, the turnout of fiscal  numbers may be more adverse than the budget had estimated.  While revenues go up by the stairs, expenditures go up by  the elevator  given the pre-poll pressures. Turning to the external account,  the review notes that the current account has shown a reversal  of the positive trend it has shown for six consecutive quarters.  The outcome in the first quarter of 2003-04 saw a deficit.  But capital flows are continuing to grow apace, partly due  to the attractiveness of India and stock markets. The reserves  are therefore growing fast. The government of India could  meet the burden of repayment of the $5.18 billion Resurgent  India Bonds, without the reserves going down even a bit. The embarrassing affluence on  the foreign exchange front has led to an appreciation of  the rupee, which in turn has had an impact on exports. Exports  grew only by 10 per cent in the first half of this year  compared to 18 per cent in the corresponding period of last  year. Appreciation of the rupee has also contributed to  the increasing attractiveness of imports, particularly of  gold and silver. But the economic experts in charge of the  review tend to dispute the attribution of the worsening  trends to appreciation of the rupee. Their argument is rather  convoluted as it emphasizes the existence of other hurdles  faced by the exporters. I quote from the review: Simply  trying to relate the export growth deceleration to the real  effective appreciation of the rupee misses out on the important  issues of productivity growth and the benefits of a market-determined  floating exchange rate regime. With all due respect to the experts,  this is too simplistic an approach. At the best of times,  exports present a challenge. The importing country does  not give much regard to the efforts we take to reduce these  hurdles in the path of the exporter. They go by the price  they have to pay in their currency. Appreciation of the  rupee means our exports become costlier to the importing  country. To deny that this affects our exports adversely  is flying in the face of logic. Economists have tried to  pooh-pooh the anti-appreciation lobby as protectionism of  a different kind. But, other countries have shown that in  their early stages of growth, appreciation of the currency  is a handicap. We should learn from their experience. One misses in the review an analysis  of the trends in unemployment and poverty alleviation. I  do hope that the coming economic survey, which the finance  minister will lay on the table of the house before the budget  is presented, will address these deficiencies. An economic  survey should go beyond estimates of the rates of growth  and fiscal deficit and should touch on important structural  issues, such as unemployment and poverty. The recent developments in Europe  are a pointer to the risks that arise from a ritualistic  adherence to fiscal standards. Both Germany and France are  struggling to get out of the Procrustean bed that the growth  and stability pact has imposed on them by restricting their  fiscal deficit to 3 per cent and debt to GDP ratio correspondingly.  True, Germany was once keen on such an act. But, by a strange  turn of events, recessionary conditions in the euro zone  have led to Germany and France breaching the standards of  fiscal deficits laid down by the act and inviting punitive  sanctions.  There is danger in such medicine  being imposed irrespective of the health of the economy.  We should learn from their experience. Fiscal standards  should be tailored to fit in with the larger goals of growth  and poverty alleviation. If fiscal rigidity stands in the  way of growth, we have to consider twice before abandoning  the latter goal, especially when the threat of inflation  is not too great, given the abundant foreign exchange reserves  and global trends. The review touches briefly on  the linkage between the expected spurt in economic growth  and increase in public investment. But, it is guarded in  drawing conclusions. Given the surfeit of forex resources,  many economic experts are coming round to the view that  increased public investment, with accommodating monetary  and fiscal policy, is the best way we can use our current  conjuncture of circumstances to prop up growth in the Indian  economy. Otherwise, we will only be supporting the spendthrift  habits of the developed world, such as the US, which sends  us its IOUs in the form of its securities.  Our policymakers need to put on  their thinking cap and evolve measures to transform an embarrassment  of riches  our forex reserves  to a tool to spur growth.  The political leadership should not fight shy of radical  solutions to the problem of slackness in the economy in  the midst of surpluses.  An investment upsurge, which will  enable the country to reach higher rates of growth, with  growth of jobs, is urgently called for. The coming budget  will show whether the mandarins in charge of the ministry  of finance and the finance minister are equal to the challenge  posed by this happy convergence of forex reserves and unutilized  capacity in the economy. Depending merely on export demand  is not advisable.  Growth has to be provided by domestic  sources. Public investment in infrastructure is, perhaps,  the only answer as it will also help crowd in the private  investment and thus increase the availability of jobs across  a wide range of industries. Appropriate credit and monetary  policies should also be encouraged. India is straining at  the leash. Growth has to be spurred by a combination of  public investment and accommodative monetary policies. Here  is to hoping that the coming budget will unveil radical  measures that break the bottleneck posed by forex flows  and turn the challenge into an opportunity.

																								Messrs Blair and Bush are terribly excited about having brought Libya around. It looks like victory of a very different flavour  the triumph of diplomacy. And this time, nobody had to go around looking for those weapons of mass destruction, to be made to look foolish (or mendacious) when they could not be found. The Libyan foreign minister has himself declared their existence in his country, only to renounce them publicly. Libya would immediately conform to the chemical weapons convention and to the protocols set by the International Atomic Energy Agency. This is certainly an important shift in relations between Libya (so far a somewhat less visible player in the axis of evil) and the United States of America, mediated by its principal ally, Britain. But the importance is more symbolic than actual. Libyas WMD, as well as its nuclear achievements, were never significant enough to create any real alarm, and what little there had been of either, including the mustard gas, had already been more or less inhibited by international safeguards. However, with this diplomatic move, Mr Muammar Gaddafis Nasser-style Arab nationalism, anti-imperialism and Islamic radicalism come of post-9/11 age, as he enters a different set of political and economic bargains with the US and Britain. 																								The lifting of the crippling sanctions on Libya may now follow, and this is the culmination of long negotiations, starting with the Lockerbie settlement, when Mr Gaddafi took responsibility for the bombing and agreed to compensate. There is a le Carr-esque twist to Libyas secret dialogues with the British. These were led by Mr Musa Kousa, now Mr Gaddafis head of external intelligence, who was, not that long ago in the Eighties, a notorious persona non grata with the British for his role in a spate of killings of Libyan dissidents across Europe and in the blowing up of a French plane with 170 people on it. Mr Kousas turnaround epitomizes Libyas discreet enrolment into Mr Bushs war on terror. Part of the deal is that Libya will now share, with the US and Britain, its sophisticated network of intelligence missions throughout Africa and west Asia, and detailed intelligence on hundreds of al Qaida and other Islamic extremists. Yesterdays terrorist is todays diplomat-intelligencer.

		 Friday, January 17, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Complete confusion at Number Ten The complete yes minister amp;  the complete yes prime minister (Penguin amp; BBC,  Rs 295 each) by Jonathan Lynn amp; Antony Jay  collects two of the finest products  of the British tradition of political satire: the diaries  of the Right Hon. James Hacker as he blunders his way up  to premiership from the ministry of administrative affairs.  Played unforgettably on television by Paul Eddington, Hacker,  together with Sir Applebey and Bernard Woolley, embody not  only the spirit of a certain kind of British comedy, but  also a perspective to Conservative politics in the Eighties.  This is from the editors preface: At all times we have  striven to maintain a chronological day-to-day account...There  is a slight risk of historical inaccuracy in this approach,  because Hacker himself was deeply confused for most of his  time in office and it could be argued that the diaries ought  to reflect this confusion. But if we had allowed the diaries  to reflect this confusion in full, the events that they  relate would have become as incomprehensible to the reader  as they were to him. A 2020 vision: a brief history  of the future (of money and banking in India) (A.K.  Das, price not mentioned) by Anjan Kumar Das  is a rather idiosyncratic book (breaking into bad verse  at unexpected moments) which attempts to create genuine  interest in the vital topics of money and banking in the  minds of the financially lay but otherwise literate and  thinking person. The book promises to end with a wish-fulfilling  climax which is also an oxymoron. 				 				 		 India working: Essays on society  and economy (Cambridge, Rs 950) by Barbara  Harriss-White describes the working of the Indian economy  through its most important social structures of accumulation:  labour, capital, the state, gender, religious plurality,  caste and the economic organization of physical space. Drawing  extensively on her own fieldwork in India, Harriss-White  challenges the prevailing notion that liberalization releases  the economy from political interference, and leads to a  postscript on the economic base for fascism in India. In  Indias intermediate economy there is no sign yet of a big  unifying project for capital of the sort necessary to a  fascist State. Nonetheless, the seedlings of fascist institutions,  ones with distinctively Indian characteristics, can definitely  be found sprouting in the economy, as well as in politics.  There is an excellent appendix, compiled by Pauline von  Hellermann, on the roles of religious minorities in the  Indian economy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, September 19, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Sai Baba, Bugs Bunny and confusionIn which annie gives it those  ones: the original screenplay (Penguin, Rs 295)  by Arundhati Roy dredges up from oblivion a little-known  period piece, made for Doordarshan in the late Eighties,  about a bunch of Indian architecture students in the dope-smoking,  bellbottom-wearing mid-Seventies. Roy plays Radha (I look  like the anorexic progeny of an unholy union between Sai  Baba and Bugs Bunny) and a jejune Shah Rukh Khan is the  gay college gossip. The film would now need subtitles, since  Roy had set out to capture the English spoken by Delhi University  students in the mid-Seventies, a fabulously un-slick era  whose innocence Roy aches for. Annie had got  the prize for Best Film in Languages Other Than Those Specified  in Schedule VIII of the Indian Constitution. But the idea  of lunatic fringe cinema, fully financed by Doordarshan  gives Roy a special kick. There is much self-congratulatory  nostalgia in her foreword: I had almost forgotten that  Annie contains the rough, jagged nuggets of the incipient  political process  all those questions, all that youthful  confusion. Nneem dreams (Rupa,  Rs 295) by Inez Baranay is a feat of bad writing,  originally part of an Australian creative writing doctorate.  England, Australia and India, and eco- science, rural development  and cosmetics are churned together in an energetically overwritten  and breathless prose to produce a richly unreadable novel.  The opening sentence reads, It is the best tree in the  world. It is the miracle tree, it is the tree of blessings,  it is the FREE tree. Orienting India (Three  Essays, Rs 100) by Vasudha Dalmia is subtitled  European knowledge formation in the 18th and 19th centuries.  It collects three short essays on the ways in which Europeans  appropriated Indian history, scholarship and ritual to assert  their own relationship with India. The essays study Max  Mueller on the Vedic past, the Benares Sanskrit College  in the late 19th century and the 1820s parliamentary papers  on sati.  Away: the indian writer as  an expatriate (Penguin, Rs 395) edited by  Amitava Kumar is a record of Indian voices away from  India. It collects a wide range of Indian writers reflecting  on India or the West, from a more or less expatriate position.  Kumar describes the book as a homage to the ordinary experience  of migration which can be at once modest and magnificent.  Tagore, Rushdie, Gandhi, Ramanujan, Kureishi, Ghosh and  the Chaudhuris, Nirad C. and Amit, are among those anthologized. Bombay, meri jaan: writings  on mumbai (Penguin, Rs 395) edited by Jerry  Pinto and Naresh Fernandes is a wonderful collection  of writing  poetry, fiction, theatre, social history, memoirs,  journalism  on Indias most cosmopolitan city. There are  Duke Ellington, Kipling, Huxley, Theroux and Malraux among  the foreigners, together with Indian writers like Kushwant  Singh, Gavaskar, Salim Ali, Rushdie and Ezekiel, among others.  There is a good translation of Arun Kolatkars poem, Fire,  a beautiful photo-feature on the waterfront and a fine piece  on the encounter cops of the Mumbai police.  India and the wto (Oxford  and the World Bank, price not mentioned) edited by  Aaditya Mattoo and Robert M. Stern regards India as  a developing economy of key importance in the WTO, playing  a pivotal role in the negotiation and design of the Doha  development agenda. The chapters in this volume provide  new information and analysis to policymakers and other stakeholders  in India, and seek to assist them in articulating their  interests and in developing negotiating strategies.

		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 PLAYING AT WAR IN TAIWAN
 Gwynne Dyer																								Taiwans president, Chen Shui-bian, is bluffing when he hints at holding a referendum on independence from China in March. The president of the United States of America, George W. Bush, was bluffing three years ago when he promised to do whatever it takes to defend Taiwan, though he was serious last Tuesday when he warned Chen to stop irritating the Communist regime in Beijing. But China is bluffing when it says that it will invade if Taiwan seeks formal independence.																								True, the rhetoric is getting extreme. Senior Chinese military officers warn that if Chens supporters refuse to come to their senses...they will push Taiwan compatriots into the abyss of war. Chen appeals to the world not to let the Beijing regime unilaterally decide what is peace, what is democracy, what is a threat, what is provocation.																								Bush, after meeting the Chinese prime minister, Wen Jiabao, on Tuesday, worried that the Taiwan government may be willing unilaterally to change the status quo...which we oppose. It sounds almost like a real crisis, but its all just a charade.																								All talk of Taiwans independence is purely symbolic, since for all practical purposes, the island has been independent for the past 54 years. In deference to the Chinese instinct for national unity, everybody has always denied this fact, pretending that the division of China at the end of the civil war was only temporary, and that there is really only One China. One China theory																								For a while Washington insisted that Chiang Kai-sheks refugee Nationalist regime in Taiwan, and not the Communist regime in Beijing, was the legitimate government of that One China, but even that argument ended in the Seventies, after Richard Nixons historic visit to China. For a long time after that, everybody agreed in principle that China would eventually be reunited under one government in Beijing  but Taiwan and Washington made it clear that it could not happen until mainland China no longer had a Communist government, and Beijing tacitly accepted that position.																								It was the breakdown of that status quo in the mid-Nineties that led to this crisis. The gradual democratization of Taiwan led to the electoral defeat of the long-ruling Nationalist Party in 2000 by the Democratic Progressive Party, which regularly plays with the notion of declaring Taiwan independent in order to win votes, but never actually does anything about it because neither China nor the US wants to be forced into a confrontation on the issue. 																								Chen, the current DPP incumbent in Taiwan, is continuing to play the same game. Besides, the referendum will be an essentially meaningless exercise that asks voters if they want Beijing to end its missile build-up across the Taiwan Straits and promise not to invade Taiwan under any circumstances. You might as well ask them if they are in favour of motherhood. Transport problems																								But in Taiwan it serves as a hint to DPP supporters that one day there might be a real referendum, which is probably worth a few votes. Since Beijing understands that nuance too, it is having a huge conniption about it  and Washington, which has enough foreign problems on its plate, is warning Taipei to back off. But its all fake: Taiwan is not going to declare independence, and China is not going to invade.																								Taiwan will not declare independence because the Communist regime in Beijing, in order to defend its credentials as the guarantor of Chinese unity, would have to reply with a show of force  thereby destroying confidence in Taiwans economy and its own. 																								Even if the US Seventh Fleet did not intervene to stop it (which it probably would not  the US does not want a war with China), the Peoples Republic of China lacks the amphibious ships that would be needed to transport an army across over a hundred miles of open ocean and conquer a wealthy, well-armed island with over twenty million people. Indeed, China has never even attempted to create such a specialized maritime capability, which tells you everything you need to know about this crisis.

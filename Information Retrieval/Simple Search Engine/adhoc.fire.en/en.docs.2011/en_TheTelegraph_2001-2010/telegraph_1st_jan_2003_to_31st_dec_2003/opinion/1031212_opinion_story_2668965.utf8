		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 DELAY IN DELHI
																								Systems and conventions determine individual action. The inordinate delay in announcing that Ms Sheila Dikshit will be the next chief minister of Delhi can be explained by a prevailing set of democratic practices in India. By any reckoning, Ms Dikshit was the obvious candidate for the post. Congress victories in Delhi came out of her work and the campaign had centred around her. Yet she was not the officially announced chief ministerial candidate before the campaign began. Theoretically, it could have been possible to appoint another person as a chief minister of Delhi. Similarly  and this is exactly what happened  it was open to another Congressman to challenge Ms Dikshits claim to be the next chief minister. The delay grew out of the impasse that was created by this challenge. It could be argued that the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, could have settled the matter by issuing an order that made Ms Dikshit the Congresss candidate for the chief ministership and overruled any opposition to Ms Dikshit. Ms Gandhi did not do this but she allowed, by design or accident, a theatre of democracy to take place before Ms Dikshit took up office for a second term.																								This piece of theatre owes its existence to a variant of an institution known as the political party. In this variant, the apparatus of the party is more important than the peoples elected representatives. The party decides who will be the chief minister or the prime minister after it has won the elections or who will be the leader of the opposition if it has lost the elections. In Westminster, from which place Indian democratic practices are derived, the parliamentary party is the party and it is taken for granted that the leader of the party is the prime ministerial candidate. Defeat in elections leads to his resignation from the position of leader of the party. In India, there is no pre-election announcement about the chief ministerial or prime ministerial candidate. It is left vague or is assumed. There is always a tantalizing gap between the de jure and the de facto.The overriding importance given to the party apparatus  and this true for all Indian political parties, the Congress, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Bharatiya Janata Party and so on  is a socialist idea that has been grafted on to the Westminster model. The outcome is a hybrid that engenders a bizarre impasse and equally bizarre modes of resolving them. In the case of Ms Dikshit, the right person has been given the post, albeit after a delay. But this may not happen all the time. The system may not always be in favour of the best individual.

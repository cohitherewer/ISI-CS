		 Tuesday, June 24, 2003  ONE MORE KARGIL
 - Political pressure alone will make an India-Pakistan dialogue  fruitful  V.R. Raghavan The author is former director general  military operations, and currently director, Delhi Policy  Group General Pervez Musharraf has threatened  another Kargil if India does not engage his government on  Jammu and Kashmir. That is the crux of his now famous and  recent interview to a television channel. His subsequent  denials, clarifications and obfuscations do not minimize  the impact of his statement. He has followed up this statement  by saying that he cannot hold back the militants indefinitely  if India does not start a dialogue. In short, the general  is portraying south Asia as being on a short fuse. Why did Musharraf make these statements?  Was it with an eye on his four-nation tour, including the  United States of America? It is well-known that he has been  trying to get received by George W. Bush at Camp David,  as a stamp of the US approval of his support in the war  against terrorism. Was the statement directed against Indian  leaders who had recently met leaders of major states? Or,  was it to satisfy the right-wing partners in his government  who are not pleased with Pakistans support to the US-led  operations? The important issue is that the  statement, even if an unguarded one, confirms what is known  in informed circles. Pakistans military leaders have an  abiding faith in their armys ability to inflict a military  defeat on India. Surprise and shock action in the form of  a rapid military strike is considered by Pakistani military  leaders as their forte. This is what they tried in  Chhamb and Akhnoor in 1965 and 1971. They believe that cutting  off the road axis to Jammu and Kashmir will force the Indian  army to seek terms due to supply lines being cut.  Even in 1999, retired Pakistani  generals were exhorting Musharraf to hold on for a month  more, for Indian forces to vacate their positions in Siachen.  Professional armies like the Indian army plan for such contingencies  and do not turn and run because supply lines are cut. In  modern war, air supply and long life supply stocking take  care of unforeseen situations. Western analysts have researched  and written of two unique characteristics of Pakistans  military leadership. The first relates to what is called,  cultural discounting. This habit disregards ground realities  and believes that cultural superiority will always prevail  in a military encounter. We in India have long heard of  the boast of one Pakistani being equal to ten Indians. Cultural  discounting dangerously colours military judgment as well  as war plans. Pakistans lost wars against India are examples  of the consequences of the false sense of superiority.  The second characteristic analysed  by political observers is of the Pakistan military leadership  setting aside advice given by their foreign and internal  affairs ministries. The two characteristics have combined  to bring about irrational military adventures with disastrous  consequences to Pakistan in the past. Can Pakistan attempt another Kargil  or a similar military adventure? General Musharraf and his  corps commanders apparently continue to believe that Kargil  was a military success. According to them, it was political  mismanagement by Nawaz Sharif which allowed the Indian military  to escape a military defeat. The facts were different and  Musharraf knows it. He and his team refuse to see the writing  on the wall, in keeping with their characteristic of disregarding  advice and ignoring ground realities. They believe that  Kargil internationalized the Jammu and Kashmir issue. The  general is unwilling to accept that Kargil in fact had the  opposite effect. Internationally, Pakistan was seen as a  dangerous and irresponsible nuclear weapons state. Its actions  consolidated the line of control as an inviolate entity.  It galvanized the Indian military system to undertake a  serious appraisal of its weaknesses. As a consequence of Kargil, there  are more forces in the Kargil sector than ever before. The  Indian army has put into place an all-weather, all-seasons  deployment. A new corps headquarters has come up in the  area which has improved command and control. Technology  has been utilized to substantially improve surveillance.  Finally, the success against heavy odds in the Kargil operations  of 1999 has raised Indian national and military morale to  high levels. Pakistan can thus neither attain surprise nor  gain military success in the area. Pakistan must therefore seek military  gains, even if small ones, elsewhere. It will, as it has  in the past 50 years, continued to look for weak spots,  gaps, lower levels of alertness, and make its offensive  plans. It will not rest until it gains some military success.  One possible area for such an attempt would be the Siachen  area. A small-scale operation there can succeed with some  considerable luck and the advantages of poor weather and  terrain. Pakistan can also attempt a covert operation through  its mujahedins and irregulars. The Hilkaka enclave  in the Poonch sector, which was cleared after months of  being in play, if repeated on a larger scale, can be a military  embarrassment to India. Indian armed forces are not waiting  for Pakistan to act. They are improving and fine tuning  their response for a possible military response. Such a  response would be swift and sure and with enough force to  make it succeed. There is better politico-military coordination  at high levels. War and battle procedures for speedy response  have greatly improved. Musharraf  given the military culture  in Pakistan  will continue to believe that another Kargil  can be attempted. The outcome will ultimately be the same.  A military disaster with even greater international ostracization  will result. Peace initiatives on Kashmir will be set back  and peace dividends will be delayed for another decade. Musharraf is currently visiting  the United Kingdom and the US. He is taking a strong position  on the military imbalance between Pakistan and India. The  imbalance is being leveraged to justify a nuclear force  structure which threatens many global interests. The US  is about to scramble to keep the general happy with additional  arms supplies and economic packages. In the interim, there  was talk of F-16 aircraft being sold to Pakistan. The US  is faced with a dilemma. It needs to back the general to  obtain his continuing support against the taliban and al  Qaida. It also needs to keep India on its side for its larger  global strategic needs. Musharraf is playing hard-to- get  through his rhetorical ingenuity and threats. The Pakistan militarys fixation  with Kargil and other unworkable military options should  warn policymakers in India and in major capitals. Peace  is not going to happen by merely urging India and Pakistan  to start a dialogue. It will require considerable political  pressure and economic leverage to make Pakistans leadership  give up on military options. Until that happens, Kargil  will be a continuing refrain from Pakistan.

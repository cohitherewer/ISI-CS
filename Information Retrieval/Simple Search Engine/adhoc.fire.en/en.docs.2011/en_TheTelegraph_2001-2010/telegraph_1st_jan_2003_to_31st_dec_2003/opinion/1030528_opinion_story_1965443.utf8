		 Wednesday, May 28, 2003  GOING ROUND IN TRIANGLES
 Unlike in Iraq where it acted unilaterally,  the US in southeast Asia is carefully weighing its diplomatic  options, write M.L. Sondhi and Ashok Kapur M.L. Sondhi is director, Institute  for Asia-Pacific Security Ashok Kapur is chairman, Department  of Political Science, University of Waterloo, Canada				 Measured steps																								Two strategic triangles are taking  shape in southeast Asia and they show that international  relations in the region depend on triangles, not military  duels. Although much of international history indeed consists  of duels, there is a difference in the way the United States  of America thinks about west Asia and southeast Asia. American  military campaign against the taliban in Kabul and Saddam  Hussein in Baghdad were basically duels between a major  power and third rate terror regimes, whose bark was worse  than their bite. But North Korea is another matter. The  US is not so concerned about Pyongyangs possession of nuclear  weapons and missiles, or its export of such weapons and  technology to Pakistan. The matter it is worried about is  North Koreas ability to send the missiles to the US and  Japan, and to export them to Iran where Israeli and American  interests are engaged.  Again, the US is not so concerned  about North Korea imploding but the fact it could produce  refugees who could move to China. Although technically,  it would be Chinas problem, it would require North Korean  moderation. Thus, Pyongyang has to be dealt with differently  from Iraq. North Korea fought the Americans in 1950-53.  Though the military campaign reached a stalemate, there  is no doubt that North Koreas military is well-trained.  It is open about its nuclear capabilities and seeks a diplomatic  solution with the US. North Koreans are skilled diplomats  and unpredictable military fighters. So the risks of war  are high for the US vis--vis North Korea. Moreover, the strategic playground  in southeast Asia is densely populated with three regional  powers  China, Japan and Russia. The neighbourhood is dangerous,  and the US must adopt a nuanced strategy that requires partners  and negotiations rather than unilateral action. The US is  therefore trying to create a web of diplomatic and strategic  triangles which will give it the space it needs to manoeuvre  in the region.  If the US is the leader here it  is not because the triangle participants have their own  interests and they have their own trajectories to develop  their power and autonomy vis--vis each other; they have  autonomy. Each triangle is about security and each player  is making short term moves with long term calculations.  In Iraq, the US rejected the diplomatic option because it  could act unilaterally. In southeast Asia, the US has chosen  the diplomatic option because other powers are firmly engaged  and entrenched. The first triangle involves the  US, China and North Korea. Japan, Russia and South Korea  were kept out of this critical meeting with the North Koreans,  the first trilateral talk since the armistice in the Korean  war. Note that the North Koreans have placed the April 23  meeting already in the context of the armistice. North Korea  wants to end the armistice, sign a peace treaty with the  US, offer America the concession of dismantling its nuclear  programme in return for US recognition and financial support,  and then turn to the international community for economic  reconstruction.  The April meeting required both  the US and North Korea to concede. North Korea agreed to  let Beijing in, as the US demanded, and the US agreed to  keep South Korea, Japan and Russia out to preserve the trilateral  armistice-type meeting structure, as North Korea wanted.  There are several reasons why China is a willing participant  in this exercise. One, because it does not want nuclear  weapons in its immediate neighbourhood (nukes in Pakistan  and Iran are at a distance and useful for Beijings interests).  Two, it does not want North Korea to implode and send its  refugees to China. Three, it does want the US to maintain  its military presence in the region to manage Japans defence  buildup and to check its independence in military and diplomatic  affairs. But the US is also buying insurance  through the second triangle which involves America, Japan  and Australia. Here the US is encouraging Japan to shed  its pacifist constitution and to join its broader southeast  Asian military plan. This month, Japan joined the US in  military exercises for aerial refuelling involving its F-15s  and the USs KC 135 tankers. Japan is also supposed to have  begun to train with US carriers at sea.  These are first ever activities  and they indicate a desire to enhance Japans power-projection  capabilities. The common aim is to manage Chinas strategic  threat, to make Japan a military partner, and not as a junior  assistant as it has been so far. There is a fine division  of labour in this triangle. Japan is being built up to engage  China, and Australia is meant to play a strategic role in  the region as well. The US meanwhile is managing and encouraging  Japans desire for a stronger defence capability and role,  given that Japan is now seeking to advance itself in the  area of space communications and intelligence because of  Chinas rising power. The US policy will have an inevitable  fallout though  raising suspicions in North and South Korea  about its intentions to make something more than a forward  American base in in the region. Americas approach has an interesting  side. South Korea, an old ally, is developing a neutral  stance in regional politics. It wants a bilateral dialogue  with Pyongyang and it wants peace. In the meantime, it also  wants to develop its space and missile programme, which  the US once objected to on grounds that it could promote  a race region. A unified and disarmed Korean peninsula would  emerge as the Myanmar of southeast Asia, balancing two powerful  neighbours, just as Myanmar seeks to balance China and India.  Thus although US generals in South Korea have formal control  over South Korean forces during a crisis, South Korea is  believed to have its own agenda and is supposed to be an  unreliable ally. In the first triangle, ties with  China and North Korea are important for US strategy to disarm  North Korea, to allow Korean unification and the development  of an economy-driven neutral Korean peninsula which is tied  to the global economic forces rather than to militarism  and instability. However, in the second triangle, Japans  rearmament is a must in part because of Japans expansion,  and because the US needs Japan as it cannot function alone  in southeast Asia. In these triangles South Korea is isolated.  It is out of the decision-making loop as far as the formation  of the two triangles is concerned.

 Falling interest rates may have been particularly hard on retired people in India, but it is not that there have been no gainers, argues Alok Ray				 	 Saving grace																								Interest rates all over the world, including India, have been falling for the last few years. What are the pros and cons of a soft interest regime, specially in a country like India?																								Basically, interest rates should have an impact on consumption, savings, investment, government finances, rate of growth and distribution of income. First, take the effect on savings. Since interest rate is the reward that a saver gets on his savings, conventional wisdom suggests that a reduction in interest rates would reduce savings. But this is not necessarily true. A lot depends on the motivation behind savings. If a person is saving for a fixed monthly interest income after retirement, a reduction in interest rate means that he would have to save more now for having his targeted income in future. The same holds for a person saving to build a fund to buy a flat or to meet the expenses for his daughters wedding. Thus the effect of a reduction in interest rates on the total savings of a country is uncertain.																								One important objective behind the reduction in interest rates was to bring down the cost of borrowing and give some relief to the precarious finances of the Central and state governments. The interest rate on the postal monthly income scheme is 8 per cent today, plus a 10 per cent bonus at the end of 6 years. No tax is deducted at source. Many relatively affluent people keep their savings in postal MIS and do not declare this income. If people save 30 per cent income tax this way, the effective cost of borrowing to the government through postal small saving schemes comes to about 11.4 per cent, even without counting the 10 per cent bonus  a very high cost, indeed, as public sector projects financed by such money yields a much lower rate of return. 																								With 30 per cent tax savings, the current 9 per cent interest rate on public provident fund implies a cost of about 12.8 per cent to the government. There is no investment avenue open to the government which can fetch a return anywhere close to this level. So the government continues to pay a massive interest subsidy to many affluent people, and even companies. 																								How about the effect on investment? There is no clear evidence that the falling interest rate regime has boosted investment as a percentage of gross domestic product. In fact, the rise in investment expenditure in the first half of Nineties took place, despite high interest rates, primarily because of the abolition of industrial licensing. Everyone wanted to expand business in many different lines. The resulting overcapacity led to a fall in the investment-GDP ratio in the later Nineties, though interest rates fell over the same period. One may argue that things would have been worse without the interest rate reduction. But that cannot be proved either way. Moreover, even a big reduction in cost of funds may fail to achieve an increase in real investment expenditure in a recession. If the existing capacity is not being utilized, why should one add to further capacity by investing more? This is the situation in many countries, including the United States of America, Japan and the European Union. India is no exception. 																								In India, the lending rate by banks has come down at a much slower pace than deposit rates. For example, the three-year bank fixed deposit rate has come down from 12 per cent to around 6 per cent over the last 8 years. In the same period, the prime lending rate, the benchmark rate at which banks lend to customers, has come down from 15 per cent to only about 12 per cent. Banks are flush with funds which they are investing in safe government bonds. Highly rated companies are able to borrow at rates below PLR or can raise funds directly from the market in India or abroad at even lower rates. The real problem is for the less established small and medium enterprises. Banks today are more interested in giving loans for housing or purchasing cars or even financing education (considered less risky) than in lending to unknown companies. So, a soft interest regime has not benefited the new enterprises to any significant extent. 																								The continuous reduction in interest rates has also raised the market price of existing bonds. People would be willing to pay a higher price for a paper which yields a higher interest rate compared to those which carry a lower interest rate. This has enabled banks in India which have a large holding of government and other bonds in their asset portfolios to reap windfall gains as the market valuation of their bond holdings has been going up as a result of falling interest rates. It is one of the main reasons why the profit picture of banks looks particularly rosy these days. The reduction in interest costs has also helped companies show higher profits. This picture would turn for the worse when interest rates reverse the direction of journey.																								Next, the redistribution issue. Retired people have suffered massively with the interest income on their savings falling drastically over the past few years. The recently introduced Varistha Yojana Scheme, under which a senior citizen can get a guaranteed 9 per cent interest rate, subject to a monthly ceiling of Rs 2,000 per month from this source, seeks to provide some relief to them at the expense of the public exchequer. In addition, senior citizens continue to receive an additional 0.5-1 per cent interest on bank fixed deposits. Perhaps given that postal MIS schemes are misused by the rich, the government could restrict this scheme to only senior citizens. 																								The argument that the real interest rate has basically remained the same  as the inflation rate has fallen along with reduction in nominal interest rate  is of little comfort to retired people. Their monthly expenditures are mostly fixed in money terms (like house rent, electricity, telephone and grocery bills) while their monthly interest income has been halved over the years. So they have suffered a large reduction in their planned real income for no fault on their part. Can the government reduce the money wages of organized workers by 50 per cent? 																								The inequity is all the more evident when compared to the retired people who are on inflation-indexed monthly pensions. These pensioners are not suffering any reduction in their nominal monthly pensions. In addition, they are getting an increase whenever prices are rising. Retired people living on interest income are being squeezed twice  through reduction in interest income and a rise in prices. Legitimately, they can expect some cushion from the government to the fall in their real income as there is no other social safety net available for them in India. 																								There are indications, however, that the global downward trend of interest rates may soon end. The central banks of Australia and the United Kingdom have recently raised interest rates. If there is economic recovery in the US and Japan, as is likely, they may follow suit. In todays integrated world economy, India cannot be far behind. Any major rise in inflation rate would hasten the process, specially in an election year. If and when that happens, the gainers and losers would start to reverse their positions.

		 Wednesday, October 29, 2003  HOW KEATS BECAME A TUBER
 The NCERT textbook on world history,  with straight lifts from an American publication, cannot simply  be dismissed as an aberration, writes Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting Well regurgitating  A leading national daily recently  carried an article on its front page about the National  Council for Educational Research and Trainings new textbook  on world history, which contains numerous straight lifts  from World Civilisations: Their History and Culture  by Edward Mcnall Burns, Philip Lee Ralph, Robert W. Lerner  and Standish Meacham. The authors of the NCERT book are  Anwarul Haque, a former reader of history at the NCERTs  Regional Institute of Education, Bhubaneswar (we now know  that he read at least one book); Himansu Patnaik, a professor  at Utkal University, (of what one doesnt know  could it  be history?) and Pratyusa Mandal of the NCERTs history  department (naturally).  This should not surprise anyone.  We recently had the celebrated example of the vice-chancellor  of Uttaranchal University and some of his junior colleagues  lifting a whole text of an article, which they passed off  as their own. What Haque, Patnaik and Mandal have done is  no different, except that the latter used their lifts in  a textbook meant for wide use by class XII students, while  the former published their article in a scientific journal.  The question that follows almost inevitably is why. Why  did they do something they would be turned out of an examination  hall for doing  cheating, no more and no less? The answer is, I think, in the  way we teach our children and the way the teachers themselves  have learned. Theres no credit given to argument and debate,  to questioning the validity of what the teacher says. Students  simply have to take down what they are told and learn it  by heart, and the one whos able to spew out what he learned  by rote most correctly is the one who usually gets the best  marks.  Polie Sengupta, the playwright,  has satirized this in one of her more recent plays, Keats  Was A Tuber, in which the satire begins with the title  itself. Its a part of a sentence in a textbook which read,  Keats was a tuberculosis patient. Students were required  to memorize the line, which they did, like zombies, dividing  the sentence into two parts to be able to memorize it easily   Keats was a tuber and culosis patient. They then repeated  this over and over again till they knew it by heart and  could safely be relied upon by their teacher to write  that down in the examination.  The emphasis, as we all know only  too well, was and still is on this kind of mindless memorizing  of given tracts of textual garbage; it isnt important that  the student understand it, but that he reproduce it correctly  in the examination. Some of these students have gone on  to become teachers, relying on the virtue of memorizing  pages of texts from different books to get their college  degrees. Messers Haque, Patnaik and Mandal are doubtless  of this breed, so is it surprising that they think nothing  of lifting whole passages from other books? To them, that  obviously constitutes education. You may wonder where Murli Manohar  Joshi fits into this. Well, hes presiding over the ministry  thats supposed to concern itself with education, and hopefully  with education in the real sense of the word. So you would  think hed do something to change this kind of teaching,  a kind that places great virtue on memorizing other peoples  writings, which then becomes a method used by those who  are appointed teachers themselves. Has he done anything  at all to change all this?  He hasnt, and of course hell  say education is basically for the states to look into,  but he cant get away with that. He has a responsibility  that he cannot shrug off; improving the manner in which  students are taught is very much a part of what hes supposed  to do. In fact that is , ironically enough, a very important  part of the NCERTs mandate. Joshi is far too clever not to  know all this. That is precisely where the danger lies.  He knows it but deliberately chooses to do nothing about  it. That may seem to be caused by either a pre-occupation  with other matters, or an indifference to the subject because  he didnt want to be the minister in charge of human resources  development anyway, but given the other facts that have  been exposed by the media, its a little darker than that.  This cannot be seen apart from  the doctoring with textbooks that hes been, as minister  for education, responsible for, even if he didnt do it  himself.  It becomes clear then what the  long-term intention is. If, as minister, he knows how subjects  are taught, and then doctors what is taught, he can hope,  in a few years, to have an army of millions of students  coming out of schools who have memorized tracts which cannot  but influence their minds, however dimly or even at the  subconscious level.  These millions will then be more  receptive to the sort of ideas that the party to which Joshi  belongs, propagates; these millions will respond a little  more to such ideas, and you have then created a huge power  base. Many of these will go on to become teachers  will,  in fact be encouraged to  and thus the process will go  on. Yes, there will always be schools  and colleges and institutes like the Indian Institutes of  Technology and Indian Institutes of Management that will  be concerned with giving their students a more sensible  and real form of education. Of course there will be; its  to these that the children of those in the power elite of  the ruling parties  and other parties  will send their  children. Because they are, after all, good parents, concerned  that their children are truly well-educated, and they know  that without a good education here they cant hope to get  abroad to those educational institutions thatll ensure  a bright, and cash-rich future for their beloved offspring.  But the focus of Joshis cronies  and servitors is on the hundreds of thousands of government  and other lesser schools where the NCERT-doctored textbooks  are taught, where the students are made to learn pages by  rote like automatons. Because its from these that the future  voters and party-workers will emerge, with no ideas of their  own but the memory of passages theyve learned by rote which  will sow some half-sensed ideas in their minds, enough for  Joshis party to work on.  The ground will have been prepared,  the seeds sown. Only the nurturing of the crop would remain,  something that rallies, yatras and inflammatory speeches  can ensure. And then, hopefully in time, the millions of  potential voters and sevaks would be ready to usher  in the new India that they have been told to believe in.  An India founded on hatred and untruths, to be built on  murder and carnage of the kind we saw in Gujarat; an India  that will be ruled by the likes of Narendra Modi and his  fellow thugs. And lest the left feel a sense  of honest outrage at what Joshi is planning, they ought  to realize that hes only doing what hes seen the left  do  fiddle with historical facts, sedulously avoid any  improvement in the system and methods of teaching, and hope  theyll produce cadres of young men and women eager to usher  in the revolution they used to dream of. Why it didnt happen  is another story, but the fact that the Left Front wins  the state elections with unfailing regularity is in part   only in part  a result of its tampering with the educational  system for over two decades. As Shylock said, The villainy  you teach me I will execute, and it shall go hard but I  will better the instruction. And better the instruction he  may very well do. Meanwhile we should be prepared to hear  of more instances of academic charlatanism as practised  by the authors of the NCERT textbook on world history. Its  just a part of a larger, darker story.

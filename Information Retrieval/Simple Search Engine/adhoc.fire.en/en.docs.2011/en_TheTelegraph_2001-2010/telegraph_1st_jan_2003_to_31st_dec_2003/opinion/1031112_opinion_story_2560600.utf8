 The month of Ramadan in the Islamic  almanac is  associated with piety. The faithful pray and fast. It is thus shocking to find Islamic militants en gaging in acts of violence in this period. The attack,  claiming the lives of 17 persons and causing injury to  122, was directed at Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. This coun try's history and geography are overlaid by the life of  the Prophet and two of Islam's most important  shrines - Mecca and Medina - are located here. The  finger of suspicion points to al Qaida, an outfit that  claims to have launched a crusade under the flag of  Islam. How an organization propagating itself as  being truly Islamic can carry out an attack on Saudi  Arabian soil in the month of Ramadan will remain a  mystery. But stranger acts of murder and mayhem  have been perpetrated in the name of religion and  vendetta. Al Qaida obviously values revenge more  than it does its faith. The attack in Saudi Arabia has  other ironies. This country has provided funds for the  propagation of Islam and the building of mosques  across the globe. Yet it is now at the receiving end of  Is lamic terrorism. This victimization is a function of a  particular perception which sees Saudi Arabia as a  collaborator of the war against terrorism being led by  the United States of America. Saudi Arabia is thus  being seen as a surrogate target for the US. It needs to  be recalled that this is not the first attack on Riyadh,  the capital of Saudi Arabia. What is also significant is that  there were no Westerners among those who were killed and  injured. There is a certain randomness in the violence.  Terrorists seldom have any compunctions about killing innocent  people. They see the taking of life as a triumph by itself.  Such acts of indiscriminate violence attempt to gain a degree  of legitimacy by associating themselves with a religious  cause. In reality, they represent nothing more than the  forces of barbarism. No religion condones killing and certainly  not the killing of innocent people. The masterminds of the  war against terrorism will have to devise new strategies  to fight this war. It is a difficult war to conduct and  win because the enemy is never visible and it is impossible  to predict where the enemy will strike next. It is evident  that the Wests intelligence network is not adequate. Witness  the failure to locate Mr Osama bin Laden and Mr Saddam Hussein.  The use of shock and awe may not be enough to win this war.  The fear of sudden suicide attacks in random places will  continue to cast its shadow on the lives of ordinary people  for some time.

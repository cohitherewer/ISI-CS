		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003  DEEDS OF DARKNESS
 - The advent of electronic eavesdropping in political campaigns  Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting  The campaigns conducted by different  political parties in the recent elections in Madhya Pradesh,  Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Delhi have brought to public  notice the use of advanced electronic technology by politicians  for various purposes. I am not referring to the celebrated  laptops reportedly used by Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan  and the other nerds in the Bharatiya Janata Party  the  Congress party still seems to rely on notes and gossip   nor to the electronic voting machines. I mean the electronic  spying devices, the hidden cameras and recording devices  which appear to have caught Dilip Singh Judeo in a rather  awkward moment, and the audio device which seems to have  Ajit Jogi saying things he really shouldnt have been saying,  not for the record, to coin a phrase. The devices arent new; theyve  been used by journalists all over the world and we have  seen for ourselves how tehelka.com used them to great  effect. But this time we have been told by politicians how  they were used in what are generally called sting operations.  Its true that the Judeo videotape was given to a newspaper;  but the intention in making the recording was clearly political  and the people behind it are quite obviously politicians. One isnt going into the morality  of this; much has been written about it, and no doubt there  will be many others who will express their reaction to what  was done, compare it, as others have, to the Tehelka sting  operation and draw various conclusions. One is actually  more fascinated by the advent of electronic eavesdropping  in political campaigns. Clearly were seeing the beginning  of a whole new dimension to election campaigning, and 2004  is bound to produce many and perhaps even more startling  instances of this new aspect of politics.  Of course, what Messrs Judeo and  Jogi did has been done by politicians as a matter of routine  for decades. But this is the first time were actually seeing  it or hearing it on tape. Weve been able to put our eyes   and in Jogis case, our ears  to the keyhole. What was  supposed to have been happening in the squalid backroom  of politics has suddenly come out on a brightly lit stage.  And these are very simple instances of eavesdropping. Hidden  cameras, hidden tape recorders. Its almost childish. Consider the possibilities which  now open up for the political parties that will be campaigning  in the next general elections. Satellite spy cameras can  look right into bedrooms and isolated locations, wherever  they are, and pick up perfectly clear footage of whats  going on there; there are listening devices so sensitive  that all they need is to have their antennae point at the  place where something interesting is being discussed or  transacted, and even if it is across a street or in a car,  wherever, they can pick up every word. Most of us have seen Will Smith  in Enemy Of The State, so we know what satellite  cameras and listening devices can do. It is equally possible,  as we know, again, to track phone calls and numbers, and  so find out whos been talking to whom and when. In other  words, no one in politics is going to have a private life  any more. Not if his opponent doesnt want him to. Not if  hes doing something his opponent wants everyone to know  about. And that, of course, is the key.  The possibility of making it all public. The possibility  of letting the stung one know whats been recorded and what  will happen if he doesnt cooperate. In other words, we  will move from looking forward to being entertained by the  actions and words of various prominent people handed out  as CDs or VCDs to the public, to watching various political  personages acting in strange ways, issuing startling statements,  suddenly making new friends and allies or equally suddenly  breaking from them. Of course, it works not just both ways  but every possible way. Blackmail will walk hand in hand  with the exposure of improper behaviour. It would be tempting to think  that the prospect of all this happening  which the bright-eyed  ones in the BJP and perhaps in other parties must have worked  out already  would make politicians and prospective election  candidates more circumspect. But the fact is itll have  only a marginal effect on their behaviour. For two reasons.  One is the fact that we, as a people, have a very complex  set of values; theyre not quite as simple as the Victorian  virtues that were instilled into our parents and grandparents.  The Judeo videotape had no effect on the results in Chhattisgarh,  and the Congress clearly made sure everyone knew ab- out  it. So mere exposure of some kinds of activities is not  going to make much of a difference. The other is the fact  that the leaders of the parties concerned will stoutly defend  their flock, however errant. Yes, Sonia Gandhi threw Ajit  Jogi into the outer darkness, but not for having tried to  bribe some BJP members of legislative assembly, whatever  they may say now; it was because he gave that all-important  letter of Congress support to the seemingly disgruntled  BJP MLAs without her approval. And look how a person as  personally clean as Atal Bihari Vajpayee has come to the  defence of Dilip Singh Judeo; the Central Bureau of Investigation  could not establish a case against him, he said. Indeed.  And lets not forget that electronic  eavesdropping can be foiled by electronic counter-measures.  So some deeds which are dark enough to warrant it, will  be shielded from satellite cameras and listening devices.  In other words, the essential business of politics will  continue. The difference will be that it will be more expensive  to continue, but with all these bundles of currency notes  being handed around, who cares about expenses? Naturally, the shielding can only  be for the very dark deeds and words; for everything else  there will have to be recourse to greater stealth and secrecy.  Subterfuge and deceit will become a standard part of political  dealings to an even greater extent than it is today. In  fact, one could go so far as to say that only those politicians  will survive who are the most skilful at lying, deceit and  secrecy. The more open, frank ones will, one fears, go to  the wall. Perhaps, then, the Arun Jaitleys and Pramod Mahajans  will have to make way for a newer, more artful, lot; those  who can do all that these two can and at the same time camouflage  what they do with what Le Carr called a legend  a whole  set of falsehoods, convincing lies and deceptions, behind  which will lie the real plan of action. Politics may then have to be redefined  as the art of the technologically possible. Something that  will leave the people much more bewildered and mystified  than they already are. They will be led to believe one set  of facts and the reality will be something else. Which  is a prospect that cannot bring cheer to anyone, except  that theres a little flaw in all this. One look at the  forecasts made of the election results by well-known psephologists  and at the results declared after the exit polls makes this  clear. Collectively, the people who were surveyed by the  experts made fools of them; and consequently, most of the  poll surveys got it wrong. While that may have had to do  with some error in computing, it seems more likely that  the seemingly simple, bewildered people inundated with the  real and mythical stories, figures and information cooked  up by the backroom boys just took them for a ride. Technology  may yet founder on native cleverness and cynicism.

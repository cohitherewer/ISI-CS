The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, August 25, 2003  LIVING WITH A DISEASED SYSTEM
 Those who have been elected by the  people to look after their interests are mostly preoccupied  with wasting funds, writes Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting Cars first, people  later  Recently the media reported that  the ministers in Haryana were dissatisfied by the cars provided  to them by the government  Maruti Balenos. They clearly  considered that these were not impressive enough. So theyve  decided to replace them all with Sonata Gold cars, each  costing over nine lakh rupees. A couple of senior bureaucrats  are also being blessed with these cars  the chief secretary  and the principal secretary to the chief minister. The chief  minister himself has modestly said that he will keep the  car he already has; a noble gesture, even if he doesnt  say that the car he already has is a Mercedes. He could,  after all, have got himself another Mercedes, or a Rolls  Royce; but he has, like a true mahapurush, declared  that he is above such mundane acts. The Mercedes he has  will do. There have also been media reports  that that admirable character, the mayor of Calcutta, has  decided to erect a gate in the city. Not any old gate, but  something impressive, wondrous to behold. After all, he  seems to have said, if New Delhi can have its India Gate,  Calcutta can have its Calcutta Gate, surely. Calcutta is  no way less than Delhi. That the corporation is virtually  bankrupt, that what little money it has could be spent on  repairing roads, improving the drainage and other civic  works isnt something that deters him. A few crores here  or there  how does it matter? One hears that hes now gone  off the gate and is spending crores on some curiosity called  Calcutta Panorama or something like that, which has figures  rather like the waxworks in Madam Tussauds in London except  that these are so dreadful as to be amusing. What isnt  amusing, though, are the crores of rupees hes pouring into  bringing this excrescence into being.  And, as if to show that what Calcutta  does today, Uttar Pradesh can also do today, or even before,  a monstrosity that is probably some kind of gate is being  erected at the entrance to Noida, the UP suburb of Delhi,  which, while it does house some very wealthy and famous  people, also has its slums, its chronic lack of power, and  a very primitive drainage system. But here again, money  is not seen as a problem when it comes to gates.  What, you may ask, is the connection  between these quite separate acts by different authorities?  What has the historic contribution to Calcuttas culture  being made by Subrata Mukherjee got to do with the historic  contribution being made by Mayavati (or her minions) to  the landscape of Noida, and what have these two public actions  got to do with the Haryana ministers climbing into their  Sonata Gold cars? There is a connection, a very vital one.  The ministers are representatives of the people. So it isnt  just they, the ministers, who are riding around in these  luxury cars, its the people of Haryana, really. It sets  Haryana apart from and on a more awesome level than the  national government, whose ministers ride in lowly Ambassadors. So what is it, then, that really  and truly justifies these crass, disgracefully stupid acts?  The people who take such decisions are not renowned for  wisdom, true, but surely someone like the chief secretary,  or the finance secretary, would have strongly opposed this  flagrant wastage of public funds and told the chief ministers  firmly that this kind of thing had to stop? But they obviously  didnt; in UP the officers would have been instantly suspended,  in West Bengal Subrata Mukherjee would have used the officers  opposition as an example of how peoples power prevails  over the dark machinations of the bureaucracy, and in Haryana   well, the chief secretarys been given a Sonata Gold too;  so that, presumably, settles that.  And theres no evidence of public  anger, of indignation among legislators and parliamentarians,  that money should be wasted in this brazen manner; those  who have been elected by the people to look after their  interests are either part of these exercises in wasting  public funds or are for their own reasons keeping quiet.  But that, while its saddening, tragic even, shouldnt surprise.  It is one more example of the diseased system that brings  such people into positions of authority, makes them lawmakers,  members of legislatures, and some of them ministers, entrusted  with building the state, eliminating such ills as illiteracy,  disease, lack of drinking water.  The excellent James Lyngdoh has  won the Magsaysay Award, an honour he richly deserves for  having kept some semblance of integrity in the electoral  system. But the evils are far too widespread and too ingrained  for one person, acting within the limitations of a single  not too comprehensive a statute, to combat or eliminate.  The continued violence by gangs of thugs and toughs who  call themselves party workers  unemployed men who have  found that there is much to be earned in collectively coercing  and frightening people into paying protection money and  then making sure they vote the way theyre told  whos  going to stop them? The police? That would be even funnier  than the thought of Central ministers travelling in Ambassadors  while the Haryana ministers whizz past in their Sonata Gold  limos. That violence spreads out as elections  near, and some key toughs in the opposite camp are killed  or maimed to show whos more powerful. One politician once  told me that while it was all very shameful, actually this,  in a way, showed which party was really the stronger, so  it was a reflection of the process of democracy! Then the  terrified voters are herded to polling stations where the  polling is peaceful all right; the voters have been well  conditioned, the poling staff made to see whats what, so  all goes according to plan. The reports then begin to come  in  polling passed off peacefully in this constituency  and in that one, and finally a declaration is made that  the polls were peacefully held.  So the real manner in which these  people, the builders of gates and buyers of Sonata Gold  limos came to power was not because the people reposed confidence  in them; not at all. If that had been the way, they would  have been worrying themselves sick about how to improve  things. But they came to power in a manner not different  from the way mafia chiefs come to power and have no feeling  whatsoever that they owe people anything. All the masses  are there for is to be terrorized. But they, the dons and  wielders of power, they have the cash, and so it goes into  what they want; if they want it, the people had better want  it if they know whats good for them. The system has been eaten away  from within, is diseased, and that disease cannot be cured  very easily. It will continue, and take even more terrible  forms, because all of us acquiesce in it. We accept it,  because we just want to get on with our lives. Truth, a  sane healthy society  these are all relative terms. Einstein  could have learned a thing or two from us about relativity.  We have a system that actually opens the doors of power  to thugs and criminals and we think that, so long as were  doing all right, it doesnt matter. But it does; sooner  or later there will be that knock on the door, and a group  of wolfish people will be standing outside, eyes ablaze  with avarice and hatred. And there will be nowhere to hide,  no pious formula to make them go away.

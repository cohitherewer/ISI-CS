		 Monday, May 26, 2003  WASHINGTON AND AFTER
 - The new consensus might incorporate the experience of Beijing  S. VENKITARAMANAN The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India The term Washington Consensus  has been used as a term of abuse or of endearment depending  upon the perspective of the observer. Those who protest  against the recent trend of globalization and privatization  have seen in Washington Consensus the pet object of hate.  They have identified it with an increasing tendency to open  up economies to constrict the role of the state, restrict  the rights of labour and favour the private sector. It had  come to mean an inclusive agenda of reforms that would be  against the interests of the poor.  In a recent article on the Washington  Consensus in the Economic and Political Weekly dated  April 12, 2003, John Williamson, who originally coined the  term in 1989, has taken pains to explain that the consensus  did not mean any of these. It incorporates 10 core principles  which he had elicited from a study of the Latin American  experience and put together at the end of a conference held  in Washington in 1989. The conference was held under  the auspices of the Institute for International Economics  in 1989. Experts from 10 Latin American countries were asked  to say how much reform had happened in each country. To  provide the basic agenda to help them focus, Williamson  had laid out 10 areas of policy reform, which, he thought  most people in Washington would agree, were needed in Latin  America.  These ten areas are fiscal discipline,  reordering public expenditure priorities, tax reform, liberalizing  interest rates, a competitive exchange rate, trade liberalization,  liberalization of inward foreign direct investment, privatization,  deregulation, and property rights. Williamson emphasizes that the  Washington Consensus did not imply consensus with the policymakers  of the American administration, although many of the elements  of the agenda were acceptable to Washington. Notwithstanding  Williamsons explanation, the common impression is that  the consensus did have the blessings of the United States  of Americas power structure. The core principles did not include  such items as emphasis on monetarism, which the then US  president, Ronald Reagan, had accepted. Nor did the consensus  include an insistence on capital convertibility. That the original concept of the  Washington Consensus had basic strengths is obvious. Unfortunately,  the actual experience with its implementation has been less  than satisfactory. Williamson takes pains to clarify that  the application of the consensus failed because of significant  diversions from its core principles. It is not right, he  therefore feels, to blame the consensus for the disappointing  economic outcome. The descent of Argentina into chaos is  often cited as a failure of the Washington Consensus of  which it was often pictured as a poster child. The problem  lay in two misguided decisions that led to Argentinas decline.  One was to link the peso firmly to the dollar and another  was Argentinas decision to splurge on expenditure using  resource flows from abroad. Argentina had thus violated  two of the ten commandments of the original version of the  Washington Consensus: a competitive exchange rate and fiscal  discipline. Williamson explains that he did  not have a chance to have a discussion with Joseph Stiglitz,  a Nobel laureate and a critic of globalization. Stiglitz  declined the request on the ground that he disagreed little  about the substance as opposed to semantics. In his article,  Williamson insists that the Bretton Woods institutions themselves  had not sponsored the consensus. This is contrary to the  widespread belief that it summarized the policy attitudes  of the two institutions. The evangelists of the Bretton  Woods institutions have been, to a large extent, responsible  for the increasing acceptance of the broad profile of the  consensus in many developing countries. Williamson takes the argument  further by sketching out the next stage of reforms on the  lines of the Washington Consensus. He says that that the  Institute for International Economics had recently assembled  another group of economists from Latin America to discuss  the future agenda. While the focus of the conference was  on Latin America, its lessons could be extended to the rest  of the world. Four big themes emerged from the  conference. They are crisis-proofing, completing and where  necessary, correcting the first generation liberalizing  reforms that constituted the Washington Consensus, complementing  them with second generation (institutional) reforms and  broadening the reform agenda to include a concern for income  distribution. The agenda gives priority to crisis-proofing,  especially because Latin America has been prone to crisis.  Reducing the vulnerability of the countries of the region  has, therefore, the highest importance. Some of the actions  that are needed to curb volatility of these economies involve  their moving away from an export profile too dependent on  just a few primary commodities. One of the other important  suggestions is that it should be ensured that sub-national  governments are subjected to hard budget constraints. Failure  in this area has been at the core of the problem of some  Latin American countries, like Brazil. The second item on the new agenda  is to adopt a sufficiently flexible exchange rate regime  to allow external competitiveness to be improved through  currency depreciation. Williamson admits that he does not  rule out the need for extraordinary measures, such as imposition  of restrictions on capital inflows to avoid overvaluation  of the currency. He, however, rules out dollarization as  a panacea. He suggests that monetary policy should be focussed  on targeting a low rate of inflation. The suggested new  reform package includes creation of a regional body to develop  an analogy to the Maastricht criteria for fiscal discipline.  The bitter experience of the European Union, with the growth  and stability pact of leading countries like Germany and  France, struggling to meet the criteria, has apparently  impressed Williamson. While Willamson admits that India  has been a vastly more stable economy than Latin America,  he has reason to worry that it is playing with fire in allowing  such large budget deficits to persist year after year and  the public debt to escalate. His suggestion is that non-merit  subsidies should be reduced in order to restore fiscal balance. Williamson argues that first-generation  reforms need to be supported by a second-generation package,  which includes institutional reforms. These involve correction  of labour policy, financial reform and further trade liberalization.  Labour markets in India, Williamson shows, are even more  sclerotic than those of Latin America. Further, Indias  import restrictions are still too high and reservations  for industries in the small-scale sector are inappropriate.  While Willamson admits that the gradualist reform of India  prevented it from being ensnared by the Asia crisis, mainly  because it did not open its capital account, the liberalization  agenda still leaves a lot to be desired. The most important second-generation  reform is institutional change. This includes cleaning up  the judiciary and the public services as also the regulatory  system. One aspect Williamson emphasizes is that reforms  have to be country-specific; there can be no one uniform  global model. Williamson points out that the  Indian political system appears to outsiders to be quite  eccentric, in that governments regularly advocate reforms,  while oppositions oppose even reforms that they themselves  had proposed when in office. This is a remark which is to  be heeded by the present Indian opposition, who had been  avid reformers while in power. Williamson admits that the original  version of the Washington Consensus to included the essential  elements of income distribution, which is critical to further  problems. In this context, the only asset that the state  can help in providing is education, in which respect India  has a long way to go. While Williamsons discussion  of the Washington Consensus is instructive, it is relevant  to remark that it ignores the experience of the Asian countries,  especially the successful experience of China. While we  should not dismiss the relevance of Latin America, we should  emphasize that the originator of the consensus needs to  admit that the Chinese experience also provides valuable  object lessons, some of which deserve to be incorporated  in the new consensus. The fact is that China has turned  out to be the manufacturing powerhouse of the global economy,  both in respect of exports and domestic manufacture, as  also in attracting foreign direct investment, notwithstanding  that it ignored many of the basic principles of the consensus.  Maybe we should look forward to a new version of the Washington  Consensus which would incorporate Beijings experience.

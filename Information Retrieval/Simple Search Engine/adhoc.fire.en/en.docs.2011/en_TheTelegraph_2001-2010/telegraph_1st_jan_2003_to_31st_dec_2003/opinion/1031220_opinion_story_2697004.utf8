		 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 INDIAN UNIFICATION
																								Mr Vajpayees call for a common currency is more than an economic agenda. It looks towards a deeper unification																								Words often contain messages that transcend their literal meaning. This is especially true of words uttered by seasoned politicians who have an uncanny knack of saying one thing and meaning something other. Experience has made it clear that Indias prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, is one such politician who is crafty enough to get away with statements which are so open-ended as to be amenable to multiple interpretations. In this sense, Mr Vajpayee should warm the cockles of all post-modernist hearts. This is not to suggest that Mr Vajpayee deliberately fudges or is economical with the truth. On the contrary, it is to applaud his way with words and their meanings, and also to recognize his skill at pointing to certain things without quite pointing a finger at them. Recently, Mr Vajpayee expressed the hope that south Asia would soon have the same currency. To borrow a term from European economic history, Mr Vajpayee was envisaging a south Asian zolleverein. It is easy to read this, as many did, as a simple economic agenda. A common currency would facilitate Indo-Pak trade. Mr Vajpayee was looking forward to south Asia emulating the European Union. The idea, seen as a mere economic one, might appear utopian or even risible. But that would be to miss the layers of meaning and significance that such a proposal contains.																								Mr Vajpayee, like all prime ministers of India before him, faces, so far as Pakistan is concerned, a problem created and left behind by the British. The name of that problem is Kashmir. It has become obvious over the years that all other problems vis--vis Pakistan have solutions or are open to dialogue and negotiations. But the one centred around the Kashmir border is a thorn in the side of all negotiating teams. India insists on calling one particular area of the map Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir, while Islamabad describes the same region as Azad Kashmir. The very names denote the measure of irreconcilability. There appears to be no solution to this particular problem short of one of the parties climbing down from its position and yielding to the others demands. That seems too far-fetched a hope.																								Mr Vajpayee has approached the solution to the problem from a completely different perspective. He has indeed taken a leaf from European history. It is a well-known conclusion among historians that Germany was unified in the second half of the 19th century not by blood and iron but by coal and iron. The leadership for this was provided by Prussia which was economically the most advanced of all the German states. India, following this model, occupies the same position as Prussia did. India is by miles the most advanced state, economically, in south Asia. A currency union facilitating greater trade can only serve as the thin end of a wedge at the end of which lies a more profound unification. This will make the Kashmir problem disappear and will not make India appear expansionist. Flag, as always in history, will follow trade. Mr Vajpayee may have no similarities with the worlds best-known Prussian Junker  and he certainly does not have a fencing scar on his cheek  but his strategies have remarkable parallels with those of Otto von Bismarck.

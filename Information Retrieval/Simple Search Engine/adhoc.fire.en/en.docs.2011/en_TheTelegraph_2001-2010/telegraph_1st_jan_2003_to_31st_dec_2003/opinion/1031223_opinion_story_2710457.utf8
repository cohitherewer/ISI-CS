		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003  REVIVING CIVIL SOCIETY
 - What a citizen handbook reveals about misgovernance in Delhi  Bibek Debroy The author is director, Rajiv Gandhi  Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi  After the recent state-level elections,  political parties have apparently realized that governance  is important. More accurately, they have realized that governance  is important for winning elections. Whe- ther this hypothesis  is true is debatable. But let that pass. Governance is about  what the government should do, and deciding an appropriate  role for the state also involves scope for debate. However,  rule of law, some elements of physical and social infrastructure  and the creation of an enabling environment for private  entrepreneurship are presumably core governance areas. As  citizens, we curse the state or government for not delivering  these services. Not just BSP (bijli, sadak, pani).  And although the word state is often used loosely, constitutionally,  the three organs are the executive, the legislature and  the judiciary.  These may have a Central angle,  a state-level angle or even a local body angle. As citizens,  we may be sick and tired of the way these three organs function,  or fail to function. However, unless citizens exert a countervailing  force, the cynicism does not get us very far. Collectively,  citizens are often referred to as civil society, and civil  society becomes equated with the media and non-governmental  organization movement. There are several instan- ces where  NGOs have been agents of change. But barring Bangalore,  and perhaps Hyderabad, not too many NGOs have been concerned  with state roles in metros. Centre for Civil Society is an  NGO based in Delhi, although it actually describes itself  as a research and educational think-tank devoted to improving  the quality of life for all people of India by reviving  and reinvigorating civil society. CCS has just brought  out a book titled, State of Governance, Delhi Citizen  Handbook 2003. This is a bit like a report-card on what  the Delhi government does, meaning the 25 agencies, boards,  corporations and departments of the government of Delhi.  Delhi is, of course, a funny kind of animal. There is the  state government, the Central government, the New Delhi  Municipal Corporation, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi  and the Delhi Development Authority, not to speak of a Cantonment  Board.  Many of the national capital territorys  problems cannot be resolved without doing something about  the national capital region, which encompasses areas from  neighbouring states. Given this multiplicity, it is not  always clear who can be blamed for misgovernance or given  the credit for good governance. It is easy to pass the buck.  Nevertheless, the CCS findings can be mapped against our  expectations of what a government should be doing. Here are 10 findings CCS regards  as most important. (1) The prevention of food adulteration  department has 28 inspectors to oversee 1.50 lakh (registered)  food establishments. At one outlet per inspector per day,  an outlet would be inspected once in 17 years. The number  of inspectors has not changed since 1960. (2) A study conducted  by Social Jurist found that more than 80 per cent of the  children who pass Class V from MCD schools do not know how  to read or write their names. (3) The Delhi Transport Corporation  employs 12 people per bus and incurs a monthly loss of Rs  25 crore, whereas private operators employ 6 persons per  bus and make profits. (4) Farmers pay 7-15 per cent of sales  to commission agents at the wholesale markets that are the  monopoly of the Delhi Agriculture Marketing Board. (5) Delhi  has 36 safai karmacharis per 10,000 persons, while  all other metros have about 18-20. (6) Over Rs 4 crore of  taxpayers money has been wasted in the old age pension  scheme as 37.5 per cent of the beneficiaries were ineligible.  In 168 cases, the beneficiaries had died, but the department  of social welfare continued to send them pension despite  being informed by local post offices. (7) At the holiday  homes for industrial workers run by the labour department,  the subsidy per visitor was Rs 1,545 (at Mussoorie) and  Rs 2,612 (at Hardwar) in 2000-01. (8) The drug control department  has 29 drug inspectors for over 500 drug retailers. The  fake drug market is estimated to be Rs 4,000 crore per year.  (9) The comptroller and auditor general concluded that the  Del- hi Financial Corporation has overstated profits by  at least Rs 171.25 lakh and the reserves and surplus by  Rs 78.99 lakh for 2002-03. (10) Only 3.6 per cent of the  MLA local area development scheme funds were spent during  1999-2000, rising to 52.2 per cent in 2002-03. Given a choice, I would have flagged  some other findings in the list of top ten. Many people  applied for below-the-poverty-line ration-cards more than  one and a half years ago. They didnt get the cards. Nor  is there any information about what had happened to their  applications. The cards had actually been issued. But had  been retained by local shopkeepers, who were siphoning off  these subsidized rations. The problem was resolved when  the Right to Information Act was invoked. Five lakh children  who live in 1,200 slums have no access to schools. Delhi  needs to set up at least 1,000 more schools, which the government  is in no position to do. But you require 14 licenses to  set up a private school in Delhi.  Transmission and distribution  losses of the Delhi Vidyut Board increased from 7 per cent  in 1953 to more than 50 per cent in 2000. In March 2001,  0.42 lakh commercial and 7.80 lakh private vehicles were  plying without val- id fitness certificates. More than 1.96  lakh challans were pending with the courts. The conservation  and sanitation department of the MCD takes 2 to 15 days  to attend to complaints regarding garbage removal. Under  the public works department, a city museum was planned more  than 15 years ago, and the expenditure has also been incur-  red. The museum is yet to materialize. The planning department conducted  a survey and found that 292 out of 293 people surveyed know  the hazards of drinking. But the directorate of prohibition  employs 34 people and spends Rs 1.6 crore to publicize this  message. Simultaneously, the Delhi State Industrial Development  Corporation and the department of tourism sell liquor to  raise revenue. According to the Delhi planning department,  the Delhi Energy Development Agency has spent Rs 1.2 crore  since 1986, but has not achieved any of its objectives.  The total cost borne by Delhi households to compensate for  water shortages is 6.5 times more than what they pay for  their consumption of water and this figure does not include  costs on water purification devices. Delhi Jal Board wastes  40 per cent of its water.  The rate of recovery of loans  by the Delhi Financial Corporation is 40 per cent of total  disbursals. About the holiday homes for industrial workers,  an evaluation report in 2001 recommended that they should  be shut down immediately. No action has been taken. The  Delhi government provided subsidies to NGOs to establish  10 Gau Sadans in Delhi. Two hundred and fifty one acres  of land was allotted, but 50 per cent of the allotted land  remain unutilized. The expenditure per cow is Rs 4,416,  more than the per student expenditure in a government school.  There is quite a bit on fiscal marksmanship. The department  of social welfare was allocated Rs 19 crore to convert dry  latrines into water-borne ones. Only Rs 71,000 has been  spent. There are many more such instances. Delhi may be the peg. But this  report card is not about Delhi alone. It is about the state  of misgovernance everywhere in India, and Delhi is just  an illustration. Instead of just being cynical about the  government, there should be such citizen handbooks eve-  rywhere in India. Without that, there will be no pressure  or impetus for change. The hypothesis that Delhi and other  state-elections were fought on governance issues will remain  wishful thinking.

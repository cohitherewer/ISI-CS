		 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 DIVIDING THE COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY
 															- DOCUMENT Extracts from the 7th Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, San Jose, May 1999 TO BE CONCLUDED				 	 Related matter																								Encourage non-governmental organizations that wish to retain ownership of the wetlands they purchase to examine opportunities... for revenue generation. This may include revenues derived from continued crop production particularly with local communities, or leasing revenues from agriculture, hunting or trapping, tourism and scientific study of plants and animals.																								 Support the education of scientific, technical and administrative staff to encourage innovative land conservation and land management mechanisms.																								 Encourage and facilitate the involvement of women, local communities and volunteers...																								Close gaps in knowledge that currently exist in wetland classification, inventory, research and evaluation, and ensure the proper synthesis, storage and retrieval needed to access this knowledge.																								 The implementation strategies should address areas of national and international interest or priority. Examples include, but are not limited to:																								(a) socio-economic valuation, inventory and wetland classification; (b) hydrology and impacts of climate change; (c) environmental and ecological cost/benefit accounting; (d) impacts of government programmes; (e) restoration, rehabilitation, mitigation and compensation for loss of wetlands; and (f) maintaining the ecological character of wetlands.																								Improve public awareness.																								 Present wetland conservation in combination with soil, land, water, air and wildlife conservation as well as sustainable development and wise-use principles in an ecological context rather than in isolation.																								 Demonstrate and explain the linkages of wise use of natural resources and water quality and quantity issues to wetlands conservation.																								 Emphasize public and decision-maker education programmes in addition to those of school children.																								 Utilize national communications opportunities (e.g. World Wetlands Day, public service announcements, videos, bus signs...) to advertise wetland conservation.																								 Broaden agricultural, water and other sectoral programmes to promote wetland conservation awareness.																								 Encourage networking through use of landowner participation programmes, recognition signs and other awareness techniques.																								Ensure delivery of international commitments.																								 Foster cooperation across international borders for the management of shared watersheds/ river basins and their wetlands.																								 Develop national delivery mechanisms for the principles of...the Ramsar Convention.																								 Explore integration of wetland goals consistent with the objectives and interests of international treaties on water, biodiversity and sustainable development.																								Defining who is responsible for implementation  it is essential that a clear agreement emerges through the consultation process as to who will take the lead in implementing the national wetland policy. This may involve one national department or organization acting as a lead coordinator and facilitator to work closely with the many ministries, partners and stakeholders involved. It is also important to define the roles for other agencies with responsibilities for wetland management. 																								Developing Implementation Guidelines  several options exist but all lead to one fact: the implementing agencies require assistance and training to understand what the policy says and means, who is in charge, what expertise is available and where, how roles and responsibilities are distributed, and many related questions. A publication entitled an Implementation Guide can be developed in tandem with development of the policy...																								The guide must be useful to stakeholders and wetland resource users. Thus it is targeted at the managers of wetlands: this could be government agencies, local communities, public or private landowners, and other stakeholders. In the case of government agencies, this may include all land managers and policy makers under the jurisdiction of the respective government which is leading the adoption of the policy. A guide can assist in the following areas:																								(a) interpretation of terminology and objectives articulated in the text of the policy; (b) description of sources of expertise available, the nature of partnership and the role of key agencies; and (c) understanding the roles and responsibilities of stakeholder and implementation agencies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 NOT QUITE THE PICTURE OF GRACE
 GOURI CHATTERJEE																								Losing is never easy. I wouldnt have been speaking so comfortably about the findings of the latest National Readership Survey if it hadnt shown The Telegraph to be leading its closest rival by more than double. It is understandable therefore that the Hindustan Times isnt quite the picture of grace under fire at being dislodged from its pre-eminent position in its home base, Delhi.																								Its comeback to the winner Times of Indias boastful trumpeting has been to point to its number-one position in the ABC sweepstakes. (The ABC or Audit Bureau of Circulation records the circulation figures of a newspaper or magazine, that is, the number of copies sold. The NRS on the other hand totals the number of readers. The latter is all-important for advertisers who go by eyeballs, no matter if the reader has bought or begged, borrowed or stolen the paper.)																								Trouble is, it was just last year and again earlier this year that the Hindustan Times was crowing about the superiority of the NRS. When the Times emerged at the top of the Indian Readership Survey (the NRSs rival), the editor of the Hindustan Times wrote more than one piece scoffing at the upstart IRS and lauding the universal acceptance of the NRS (which of course still put HT ahead). It may be just a coincidence, but every time you try to access these articles through the internet now you are told, The page cannot be displayed. 																								Responding to the Times of Indias bragging, of course, is not the real problem. Coming up with answers to improve the figures is. Never an easy task, for HT it will be more so. For years now, HTs motto appears to have been whatever TOI can do we will do better. In other words, TOI set the agenda, not HT. 																								If TOI dropped price to win over readers, HT matched it exactly. If TOI started Delhi Times to woo the 20-35 age category, HT responded with HT City. If TOI straitjacketed all reports to 300 words to cater to the attention span of todays readers, HT followed. If TOI broadcast its IRS/NRS rankings on its own pages, the HT reacted. Sadly, imitation, is not a winning formula. At least in Hindi																								May be there are people who want fast news, or fast food news, the smart people who want their news on the run. But Headlines Today, which was founded on this concept, is yet to find them. So it has done the next best thing, gone in for an image makeover. 																								Over the weekend, it has emerged with a brand new look. Smart sets, bright graphics, its very own studios. If this doesnt get them the attention they need so desperately, it seems to be saying, then nothing will. 																								Nothing may. But if, as is likely, it remains televisions weakest link, it can always use the language card. 																								Its not Headlines Today alone. There are few takers here for news in English. None of the English news channels, including BBC, CNN and NDTV 24x7, have anything to write home about. None has been able to clock an average viewer-spend of even 10 minutes a day. 																								However globalized we may be, when it comes to matters of the heart, like news or entertainment, we still want them in our own language. Or at least, in Hindi.  Too rich for the news																								Fiat and Vauxhall drivers are more likely to visit mainstream news sites than BMW and Ford drivers, according to a Nielsen/NetRatings report released last week. Conducted in the UK, the survey says that the BBC website is the second most popular site with this group. Fiat drivers also rank news sites in their top 12, with The Telegraph at number 10 and The Times at number 11. Generally, travel, auto, and finance sites were popular among all four groups, but BMW and Ford drivers didnt have one mainstream news site in their top 12. The reason why is anybodys guess. I think rich people, like George Bush, have others to check the news for them. They have better things to do with their time.

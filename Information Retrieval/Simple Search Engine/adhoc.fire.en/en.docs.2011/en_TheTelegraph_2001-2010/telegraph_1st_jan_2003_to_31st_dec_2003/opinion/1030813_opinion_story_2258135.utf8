 															- Document  Extracts from the Human Development  Report 2003, published by the United Nations Development Programme				 	 Pressing problems																								There were some positive developments during the Nineties: about 438 million people in developing countries gained access to safe water, and about 542 million in urban areas gained access to proper sanitation. But due to rapid population growth, the number of urban dwellers lacking access to safe water increased by nearly 62 million...In the major cities of Europe and North America more than 90 per cent of households are connected to piped water and sewers. But in the rest of the world the situation is very different. If adequate sanitation is taken to mean a toilet connected to a sewer, there is a significant lack of adequate sanitation throughout the developing world...And sanitation coverage is much worse than water coverage in every region.																								In the Nineties, the number of children killed by diarrhoea  the result of unsafe water and sanitation  exceeded the number of people killed in armed conflicts since World War II. Moreover, half the worlds hospital beds are occupied by patients with water-borne diseases, meaning that expensive curative services are being used to treat diseases that could easily have been prevented.																								In south Asia, only 37 per cent of the population has access to adequate sanitation. Some 1.4 million of the regions people still either defecate in open areas or use unsanitary bucket latrines. In sub-Saharan Africa the more pressing problem is safe water, available to just 57 per cent of the population...																								As with the other millennium development goals, increasing access to safe water and sanitation also requires addressing gender inequities. African women and girls spend three hours a day fetching water, expending more than a third of their caloric intake. Such household chores keep many girls out of school  and if they attend school, the energy they use performing household chores seriously undermines their school performance. Moreover, when other family members become sick, often due to water or sanitation-related diseases, girls are more likely to be kept home to care for them. And when water is needed in schools, girls are sent to fetch it, reducing their time for study and play.																								The policy priorities for achieving the water and sanitation goals involve: increasing resources. Low-cost technologies are available to increase household and community access to safe water and sanitation. But for cash-strapped governments, wastewater treatment infrastructure is extremely expensive to install and maintain; increasing equity. Poor people often cannot afford water and sanitation costs because wealthier users are not paying enough. And in poor households girls and women suffer more from difficult access to water and sanitation;																								Increasing appropriate maintenance. Too often, water and sanitation delivery systems are poorly maintained by governments and do not respond to local needs; limiting environmental damage. Sustainable water supplies require rational water use  especially in agriculture. 																								In water supply low-tech, low-cost technologies include household connections, public standpipes, boreholes, rainwater collection and protected springs and wells. These technologies are far better than alternatives such as bottled water, tanker truck provision of water and unprotected springs and wells. Some of these alternatives are unsafe, while others are inappropriate because they cannot be secured in sufficient quantities.																								In sanitation there is a pressing need to provide technologies that people want to use, because decisions about sanitation are made at the household level. Households do not need to be convinced about the merits of a well or a standpipe. But they may need to be sold on the merits of onsite sanitation, as well as given adequate hygiene education...Appropriate technologies include pour-flush latrines, simple pit latrines, ventilated pit latrines and connections to septic tanks or covered public sewers. In rural areas waste disposal through composting is sometimes appropriate.																								Such technologies are affordable to and can be easily maintained by poor communities. In the past, governments often took a top-down approach, installing hand pumps, tube wells and even ventilated pit latrines regardless of whether there was demand for them. As a result communities generally neglected maintenance or relied on the government to perform it. But when communities  especially women  are involved in providing and financing facilities and trained to maintain them, ownership and sustainability increase. TO BE CONCLUDED

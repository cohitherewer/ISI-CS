 - Anyone interested in the Indian economy should read the  BRIC report  Bibek Debroy The author is director, Rajiv Gandhi  Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi  The recent report on the BRIC  nations  Brazil, Russia, India and China  has sometimes  been quoted in Indian papers, but not in great detail. Anyone  with an interest in the Indian economy should read the BRIC  report. You will find it readily on the internet. More accurately,  the BRIC report is Global Economics Paper No. 99, brought  out by Goldman Sachs in October 2003, and is titled, Dreaming  with BRICs: The Path to 2050. Here are the startling facts for  BRIC as a group. In less than 40 years, the BRIC economies  can together be larger than the G-6 (United States of America,  Japan, Germany, France, Italy, United Kingdom) in dollar  terms. Note that these are not purchasing-power-parity dollars,  but official-exchange-rate dollars. These are also real  dollars, or if you like, todays dollars. Of the current  G-6, only the US and Japan will be among the six largest  economies in the world in 2050. About two-thirds of the  increase in the gross domestic product from the BRICs will  come from higher real growth. The balance will be through  currency appreciation and BRIC exchange rates may appreciate  at an average rate of 2.5 per cent a year. As early as 2009,  the annual increase in US dollar-spending from the BRICs  can be greater than that from the G-6. By 2025, the annual  increase in US dollar-spending from the BRICs can be twice  that of the G-6, and four times higher by 2050. The shift in GDP, relative to  the G-6, takes place steadily over the period, but is most  dramatic in the first 30 years. In 30 years, Indias economy  is likely to be the third largest in the world, after the  US and China. Note again that this is not in PPP dollars.  Growth for the BRICs is likely to slow significantly towards  the end of the period, with only India seeing growth rates  significantly above 3 per cent by 2050. But individuals  in the BRICs are still likely to be poorer on average than  individuals in the G-6 economies, with the exception of  Russia. That is, even after the growth, per capita income  in BRICs will be lower than in G-6. Okay, there may be some skepticism  about what Goldman Sachs have to say on Brazil and Russia.  But I dont think that there can be too much skepticism  about the Indian projections. Several people have done projections  for India, although these projections are usually upto 2020,  not 2050. The Tenth Plan (2002-07) talks about 8 per cent  GDP growth. Even if 8 per cent isnt likely, most people  will accept 7 per cent as an acceptable trend over the next  20 years. However, unlike Goldman Sachs,  most economists dont usually factor in demographic transition  in such projections. Lets state it simply. Fewer babies  are being born in India now. At least at an all-India level.  But several babies were born 20 or 25 years ago and those  babies are now entering the labour force. This reduces the  dependency ratio. Of course, productivity of these new entrants  depends on whe- ther they have education and skills and  whether jobs can be found for them. East Asia went through  this demographic transition 20 to 30 years ago and econometric  estimates suggest this demographic transition added a clear  2 per cent to GDP growth in east Asia. Even if we dont  get an increment of 2 per cent, why should we not get an  increment of at least 1 per cent thanks to demographic transition?  Today, the rate of population growth is around 1.8 per cent  and should slow down to 1.5 per cent in the next 10 years,  and to perhaps 1.3 per cent in the subsequent 10 years.  If you take away 1.5 per cent from 7 per cent, you still  get 5.5 per cent per capita GDP growth. In other words,  5.5 per cent is perfectly reasonable. Compare this 5.5 per cent with  what Goldman Sachs have, broken up into a productivity gains  contribution and a demographic component. The assumed per  capita GDP growth is 3.7 per cent for 2000-05, 7.5 per cent  for 2005-10, 7.4 per cent for 2010-15, 7.2 per cent for  2015-20, 7.4 per cent for 2020-25, 8.2 per cent for 2025-30,  8.9 per cent for 2030-35, 8.9 per cent for 2035-40, 8.3  per cent for 2040-45 and 7.6 per cent for 2045-50. You get  such precise numbers because they come out of a model.  The difference with traditional  economic forecasting is that no economist normally dares  to forecast or predict exchange-rate behaviour. Hence, if  you find an economist juggling around with that 5.5 per  cent per capita, that growth will be applied on todays  base per capita income of say 500 US dollars, assuming the  exchange rate stays unchanged. Goldman Sachs convincingly  argue that with growth, there will be capital inflows and  with capital inflows, the rupee has to appreciate. Remember that average appreciation  of 2.5 per cent a year. Since per capita income is a rupee  figure, any rupee appreciation vis--vis the US dollar,  results in a higher dollar per capita income figure. Think  of it slightly differently. Before the reforms started,  the rupees exchange rate vis--vis the dollar was around  Rs 21. Today, it is around Rs 45. Had the exchange rate  continued to be Rs 21 to a dollar, the Indian per capita  income today would have been around $ 1070, not $ 500. Goldman  Sachs rightly argue that as economies develop, you cant  mess around with the exchange rate. It attains its true  value. Part of the reason (roughly one-third  of the reason) why Goldman Sachs get higher per capita growths  than other projections is because of this exchange-rate  appreciation. As I said earlier, you will find the detailed  assumptions in the model, in the paper that is freely available  on the internet. But to me, the assumptions seem to be perfectly  realistic  not best-case scenarios, but most-likely scenarios.  What kind of dollar per capita  incomes do these growths translate to? 468 dollars in 2000,  559 in 2005, 804 in 2010, 1,149 in 2015, 1,622 in 2020,  2,331 in 2025, 3,473 in 2030, 5,327 in 2035, 8,124 in 2040,  12,046 in 2045 and 17,386 in 2050. The mind begins to boggle  because these are stretched to beyond 2020. Several people  have talked about around 1,500 in 2020 and no one has batted  an eyelid. It becomes easier to appreciate these numbers  if we link them to where other countries are today. In 2010,  we will be roughly where Ukraine is today. In 2015, we will  be roughly where Paraguay is today. In 2020, we will be  roughly where Iran is today. In 2025, we will be roughly  where the Dominican Republic is today. In 2030, we will  be roughly where Latvia is today. In 2035, we will be roughly  where Hungary is today. In 2040, we will be roughly where  South Korea is today. In 2045, we will be roughly where  Greece is today. And in 2050, we will be roughly where Italy  is today. Remember that we have an enormous amount of catching  up to do. That per capita income of 17,386  dollars in 2050 may make us salivate. But in 2050, Brazil  will have a per capita income of 26,592, China of 31,357,  Russia of 49,646, France of 51,594, Germany of 48,952, Italy  of 40,901, Japan of 66,805, UK of 59,122 and US of 83,710.  To me, the importance of these numbers lies elsewhere. After  all, per capita income is only a means. It is not the end  product. To me, improvements in human development indicators  are much more important. Thats when a country becomes developed  and that is not something the present Goldman Sachs report  is interested in. But using these figures, I can hazard  a guess that we are looking at around 2042, when the per  capita income threshold of 10,000 dollars is crossed. Certainly  not in 2020.

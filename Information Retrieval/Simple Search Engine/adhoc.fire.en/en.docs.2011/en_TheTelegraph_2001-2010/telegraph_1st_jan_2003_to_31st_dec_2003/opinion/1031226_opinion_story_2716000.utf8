		 Friday, December 26, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																How memory can get us into trouble Fort walks: around bombays  fort area (Eminence Designs, price not mentioned)  by Sharada Dwivedi and Rahul Mehrotra is more than  just a guide-book that suggests ten walks in the old Fort  area (the original ramparts of which used to stretch from  Victoria Terminus in the north to Lion Gate in the south).  It also tries to initiate the walker into conservationist  awareness  the only way in which the heritage regulations  of the state government could become part of the living  experience of the ordinary Bombayite. With Chirodeep Chaudhuris  excellent black-and-white photographs, this book is structured  and designed explicitly to bring to the notice of the people  who use the area some nuances of the historic landmarks  of the Fort which might otherwise perhaps go unnoticed.  The distinctive muddle of the Zoroastrian Neo-Gothic Art  Deco architecture, embellishments and interiors in the area  are explored in detail as an essential part of what is to  be enjoyed and conserved in this incredible megalopolis  of Bambai-Bombay-Mumbai. This photograph shows relief Art  Deco figures on the New India Assurance Company Building  on MG Road. 																												How The Mind Forgets and Remembers: The Seven Sins Of Memory (Rupa, Rs 195) by Daniel L. Schacter is an extremely readable and important revisiting of the psychopathologies of everyday life. Schacter  a Harvard psychologist  lucidly explains the different ways in which memory can get us into trouble. He explores the nature of memorys imperfections, presents a new way to think about them, and considers how we can reduce or avoid their harmful effects. He casts his net widely and variously for his illustrations, looking at literature, cinema, history and everyday life. A fascinating book  surprisingly free of transatlantic psycho-babble. The Widow Of Vrindavan (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Kusum Ansal narrates the travails of the widow Tapasi, variously exploited and brutalized by individuals and society. Ansal has been around in Vrindavan: Treading mechanically down the pathways of Vrindavan I often found myself among destitute, skeletal widows whose presence was profoundly disturbing to me. I gazed with willing tears at these weary and sad-eyed travellers. They stirred me. They challenged me. They put me in a dilemma as to how to react to them. What to do about them? It is unfortunate that Ansal chose to write a novel about them, relying on scarcely more than the goodness of her heart to see herself through the endeavour.

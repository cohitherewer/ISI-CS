The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, August 19, 2003  PROPAGANDA AND POWER
 - Spin has become far more important since E.H. Carrs time  RAMACHANDRA GUHA Alastair Campbell:  one more strategy  In 1939, on the eve of World War  II, the historian, E.H. Carr, published a little pamphlet  called Propaganda and International Politics. The  art of persuasion, he wrote here, has always been a necessary  part of the equipment of a political leader. For power  over opinion is not less essential for purposes of government  than military and economic power, and is closely associated  with them. Propaganda was useful and necessary in times  of peace, and critical and indispensable in times of war.  Carr quoted the political scientist, Harold Laswell, for  whom the central lesson of the conflict of 1914-18 was that  psychological war must accompany economic war and military  war.  Carr pointed out that it was the  Catholic church which first realized the power of controlling  the minds of the people. In the Middle Ages, the church  created the first censorship and the first propaganda organisation,  both intended to promote certain kinds of opinion and to  suppress other kinds. However, in the 20th century the importance  of thought control had multiplied manifold. The broadening  of the basis of politics had vastly increased the number  of those whose opinion is politically significant. Until  comparatively modern times, those whose opinion it was worthwhile  to influence were few in number, united by close ties of  interest and, generally speaking, highly educated; and the  means of persuasion were correspondingly limited. To control  the medieval subject, the church and its clergy would suffice;  but to persuade the modern citizen, the state had to use  the multiple instruments of radio, film, and the popular  press  these identified by Carr as the three chief instruments  of mass appeal.  E.H. Carr made a distinction between  international propaganda, aimed at delegitimizing foreign  governments in the eyes of their citizens; and national  propaganda, aimed at legitimizing ones own government for  ones own citizens. Writing on the eve of a major world  conflict, he naturally focussed on international propaganda.  But recent events in the United Kingdom, particularly, have  shown that the two are inseparably connected. This is especially  so in times of war, when one must both motivate and manipulate  those who are asked to support, in whatever fashion, the  fight for King and Country.  For two weeks in July, I was in  London, and, as ever, looked forward to reading a press  I regard as the most vigorous and entertaining in the world.  But for much of my visit the newspapers were dominated by  a single story  the fight between the prime minister, Tony  Blair, and the BBC. Back in the last week of May, the journalist,  Andrew Gilligan, had suggested, on BBCs influential Today  programme, that the government had sexed-up a dossier  they presented to justify the war in Iraq. Specifically,  they had claimed that Saddam Hussein was in possession of  weapons of mass destruction which could be used at forty-five  minutes notice. Gilligan said that a source had told him  that the government printed this information while knowing  all along that it was wrong (or at least unproven). He followed  up his radio story with a signed article in the press claiming  that the report was embellished on the specific instructions  of the prime ministers all-powerful director of communications,  Alastair Campbell.  The prime minister and his men  were already prejudiced against Gilligan, who had previously  reported on how the people of Iraq disliked the invading  Americans even more than the odious Saddam. Campbell angrily  denied that he was responsible for the sexing-up, and  demanded an apology. The BBC stuck by Gilligan. Abuse and  innuendo flew thick and fast. Supporters of the BBC felt  that the credibility of the government, and of Campbell  in particular, had been called into question. In turn, Blair  and his supporters accused the BBC of left-wing anti-war  bias. With the possible exception only  of the National Health Service, the BBC is Britains most  respected public institution. A fight between it and the  government made for very good copy indeed. For the first  week of my visit the press, and much of the public, seemed  to be on Gilligans side. The resignation of Campbell was  widely called for. But then the spotlight shifted away from  Blairs spin doctor to an authentic PhD. This was for David  Kelly, the biological scientist who was identified by the  government as the most likely person to have spoken to Gilligan.  Under interrogation, Kelly admitted to having spoken to  the journalist, but added that his words had not been accurately  reported. While he had not found any weapons of mass destruction  on his visits to Iraq, he had nothing to do with the preparation  of the dossier which advanced the infamous forty-five minute  claim. In other words, Gilligan had sexed-up his  report. Asked by the chairman of parliaments foreign affairs  committee what lesson he had learnt from the episode, Kelly  answered, with a wry smile: Never speak off the record  to a journalist. Three days after his testimony  to parliament, Kelly was found dead in the woods near his  home. He had apparently committed suicide by slashing his  wrists. The press now looked for a suitable scapegoat. Some  sections claimed that the outing of Kelly was done to  save Campbells skin, and that the public exposure had created,  for the scientist, an unbearable crisis of conscience.  Others felt that the blame should  be shared equally between the government and Gilligan, the  journalist whose own reliability was no longer being taken  for granted. By the time I left England, the focus had shifted  to the future of Tony Blair himself. There was talk that  perhaps he would not survive this crisis, and that there  might be a change in the leadership of the Labour Party  before the next election. State propaganda is normally associated  with totalitarian regimes, with the likes of Hitlers Germany  and Stalins Russia. But to me, the lesson of the Blair-BBC  tangle is that propaganda plays an even more important role  in democratic countries. General Pervez Musharraf has no  reason to feed the press, for in the next Pakistani election  he intends to run only against himself. But in countries  like Britain and India, where the press and television can  genuinely influence popular opinion, politicians in power  who wish to retain power must take proper heed of it. They  have to work subtly at making sure that their work and their  lives are presented in the best, or perhaps I should say,  least unflattering, light. Hence the importance of spin,  of selective presentation and interpretation of data on  the affairs of the state. In the years since Carr wrote,  the influence and reach of the media have greatly expanded.  This has made propaganda even more central to democratic  politics. Where voting is free and fair, and regular, politicians  naturally want the voter to think well of themselves. However,  the urge to be in or stay in power can be so overwhelming  as to lead to embellishment, exaggeration, or plain untruth.  Hence also the increasing suspicion among ordinary people  of what politicians say or think. Consider, in this connection,  the annual surveys conducted in Britain over the last twenty  years by the polling organization, MORI. These reveal a  noticeable decline in the status and credibility of government.  Between 1987 and 2001, the percentage of those Britons who  trust the government to place the nations needs above party  interests always or most of the time has declined from  47 per cent to 28 per cent. Political parties are the institutions,  and politicians the class of individuals, that the public  most distrust.  Correspondingly, they have most  trust in the army as an institution, and in doctors, among  classes of professionals. An intriguing finding was with  regard to the media, with television ranked second among  institutions that were trusted, but the press ranking second  last. There was thus a clear difference between attitudes  to images and print respectively. It seems that in Britain  to see is to believe but to read is to doubt or question. Reading the latest MORI results  made me speculate as to the likely results of such a poll  in India. Admittedly, it would be far more difficult to  conceive and carry out here, given the staggering heterogeneity  of our population. And, given the greater personalization  of our politics, it would probably have to centre more sharply  on individuals. Thus the British question: Do you trust  the government to place the nations needs above party interests  always or most of the time? would perhaps have to be reformulated  as follows: Do you trust Laloo Yadav (or Vajpayee or Sonia  Gandhi) to place the claims of social justice (or Hindu  pride or social peace) above their personal interests always  or most of the time?

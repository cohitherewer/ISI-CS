 - One of the most eventful decades for the Indian economy  BHASKAR DUTTA The author teaches at the University  of Warwick, United Kingdom The decade of the Nineties has  been amongst the most eventful as far as the Indian economy  is concerned. A fundamental instrument of government policy  disappeared with the dismantling of the system of industrial  licensing, while other radical reforms altered the basic  features of the Indian economy. Gross domestic product growth  rates fluctuated, the Bombay sensitive index rose to dizzy  heights in the mid-Nineties and then plummeted down after  the collapse of the technology boom, and governments changed  several times. But despite all these transformations and  upheavals, the economy was characterized by a remarkable  degree of price stability for much of this period. This  was even more remarkable when one recalls that the Central  government maintained a fairly high level of fiscal deficits  during the decade, and much of this was monetized. Unfortunately, the official wholesale  price index shows that the rate of inflation has crossed  6 per cent towards the end of March  this is a two-year  high. The truckers agitation in April resulted in a further  increase in prices, so that the WPI figures for April look  even worse. To the extent that the truckers movement was  a temporary phenomenon, the inflation figures for April  can be ignored. But the March WPI figures are a cause for  serious concern.  When elections are imminent, a  typical knee-jerk reaction of the Central government is  to give priority to anti-inflationary policies, which are  sometimes inimical to growth. There are hopeful signs that  an industrial revival is round the corner, and anti-inflationary  policies should not choke off possibilities of industrial  growth. One can only hope that the government will respond  in a rational manner, after serious analysis of the causes  of the current inflationary pressures. Of course, no one can really question  the importance of controlling inflation. If inflationary  pressures are not contained, then the rise in prices may  disorganize production by distorting market signals. Exorbitant  increases in the price level also hurt the fixed income  group consisting of salaried employees, pensioners and daily  wage earners since their money incomes always lag behind  price increases. The plight of pensioners will be particularly  severe  an overwhelming majority of them depend on interest  incomes. Nominal interest rates have been pushed downwards  over time in order to reduce the cost of borrowing of industrialists.  This move has been justified in the past by appealing to  the low levels of inflation which ensured that real rates  of interest remained at moderate levels despite the fall  in nominal rates. But the current rate of inflation implies  that the real rate of interest is negligibly low. What are the possible factors  which can cause inflationary pressures? Prices can rise  sharply when the economy is overheated. In somewhat simplistic  terms, this happens when excess demand in the economy pushes  up prices because supply falls short of demand. This phenomenon  is likely to occur when an economy is growing very fast.  In such situations, the textbook remedies to control inflation  are to operate on the demand side of the economy, and adopt  policies which curb demand. For instance, the government  can increase taxes to reduce disposable incomes and hence  aggregate demand. A more typical measure to curb aggregate  demand is to restrict availability of credit, either by  increasing rates of interest or more directly by imposing  quantitative restrictions on the supply of credit. This  forces entrepreneurs to postpone their investment decisions.  So, aggregate demand falls and inflationary pressures are  mitigated. Such measures have an obvious  downside  a fall in aggregate demand can restrict growth.  Moreover, if inflationary pressures are not caused by excess  demand, then such policies have no effect on price levels.  Factors on the supply side may just as well trigger off  cost-push inflation. For instance, a shortfall in production  or supply of some crucial input may push up cost of production  of some goods and then set off a chain reaction which leads  to spiralling prices. As a matter of fact, a popular perception  is that the increase in international oil prices during  the build up to the war in Iraq has been the main factor  behind the current round of inflation. Fuel is an important component  of the overall price index. Moreover, there was a rapid  increase in the wholesale price of fuel throughout the last  calendar year. So, the increase in oil prices has contributed  to the overall rise in prices during the last three months.  However, with the war in Iraq coming to an end rather quickly,  oil prices seem to have stabilized, and so should not have  any bearing on the inflationary situation in the immediate  future. What is of greater concern is the steady rise in  prices of primary articles. This group includes both food  and non-food items such as oilseeds and cotton. Not surprisingly, the rise in  prices of food items has been relatively modest, although  last years harvest was rather poor. This is because the  government has been sitting on huge stocks of food grains,  and must have been only too happy to release part of the  excess stocks into the market. Unfortunately, the government  does not have stocks of cotton or oilseeds, and the paltry  production last year has caused prices to shoot up astronomically. Although the government does not  have any stocks of cotton or oilseeds, it has managed to  accumulate a very comfortable reserve of foreign exchange.  Thus, there is no reason why the government cannot import  large quantities of crucial non-food items during the next  few months. These imports will add to the domestic supply  and thus have a dampening effect on prices  just as the  release of food grains from Food Corporation of India warehouses  has had on prices of rice and wheat. Of course, imports  of items such as oilseeds and cotton can only be a temporary  palliative. The situation will improve if the agricultural  harvest this year is satisfactory. If the nascent industrial revival  does actually take place, then there will be some increase  in aggregate demand. However, there is sufficient excess  capacity in the economy to ensure that the increase in aggregate  demand is matched by an increase in supply of goods. In  the immediate future, effective supply side management in  the form of judicious imports of non-food items and release  of food grains from buffer stocks will ensure that inflationary  forces do not run out of control.

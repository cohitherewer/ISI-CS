		 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 KEEP THE NET FREE
 Subimal Bhattacharjee																								Keeping the cyberspace free of controls was the subject of much debate at the recent World Summit on the Information Society in Geneva, the first such gathering. Along with ensuring freedom, we also need to find ways to address the issues arising out of the rapid growth of the online community, as the secretary-general of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, pointed out. 																								Nations across the world are at different stages of preparedness in this area. There is China, which has always censored the net. But even democracies have tried to throttle the internet  in many cases out of necessity but also without understanding of the ramifications of such moves. 																								In India, the department of telecommunications issued a directive to all Indian internet service providers sometime in early September this year, to block a website, groups.yahoo.com/ group/kynhun. The reason  the online forum was facilitating interaction among members of the Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council, an anti-India secessionist group which promoted terrorism. 																								Since this was the first case where national security interests guided the actions of the authorities, the implementation of the order raised more questions than it answered. 																								The order was meant to ban a specific group, but all yahoo-groups traffic to and from the country was blocked, since many of the ISPs did not have the technology to block a single group. Thus even yahoogroups doing useful work in the fields of education and health stopped working. As a result, the government too was flooded with protests. 																								Meanwhile from a user base of just 25 for the last one year with only 31 messages, the membership of the Kynhun group swelled to 143 and it also garnered some unsolicited publicity.																								But the government was within its right to issue the order. By a statutory order issued in July this year, the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team can block websites after it verifies complaints made by some government organizations and is satisfied that such an order was necessary. Tackling the issue of freedom of expression, the order said that websites promoting hate content, slander, racism, terrorism, violence and gambling could not take recourse to the constitutional right to freedom of expression and hence blocking them was not censorship but ensuring a balanced flow of information.  Online venom																								The IT Act of 2000 does not have explicit provisions for blocking websites except section 67 that allows the blocking of pornographic content. 																								It would have been best to ask Yahoo! to remove the offensive content from its site. Many extremist groups have their websites and use chat and message forums for anti-India propaganda. Such content is available via Indian ISPs, but each of them cannot be blocked. Also, blocking one will not help plug the online venom. 																								Our law enforcement agencies have enough evidence to intercept such activities. So why have these websites not been targeted? 																								In its official comment, Yahoo! said that the DoT order was blocking all yahoogroups and that at no time was the Kynhun groups content available on the Yahoo! India server. Does that mean that the group was present on some other server that the Indian government had no right to block? 																								In August last year the company had signed a voluntary pledge in China to keep its Chinese website free of offensive content critical of that countrys Communist regime. It also agreed to regularly sift its website. Reportedly, it went a step further and offered to provide the Chinese government links to websites with unhealthy content. Why could not Yahoo! make comparable concessions for the worlds largest democracy? 																								Earlier during protests by France two years ago over pro-Nazi contents on Yahoo!s website, the company had taken a contrary stance, telling the French government that it could not suit its content to the laws of every country. 																								The incident with Yahoo! has highlighted the need for greater maturity in handling the cyberspace, as well as the need for a minimum of regulation.

		 Friday, April 18, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Romantics, rebels and reactionaries Iraq: a report from the inside  (Granta,  5.99) by Dilip Hiro is a comprehensive  and extremely readable analysis of the hard realities of  Saddam Husseins Iraq. Combining years of experience in  writing on the Islamic world and extensive travels within  west Asia, Hiro presents a brief chronicle of Iraq, spiced  periodically with an anecdote or telling quote. This chronicle  weaves together an account of how ordinary Iraqis manage  to survive in the face of extensive sanctions, the history  of the Baath Party and the rise and rise of Saddam Hussein.  Hiros unsettling survey builds up to a few basic questions  regarding weapons inspection and Iraqi disarmament, the  evidence for Iraqs links with al Qaida, and the role of  the CIA and M16 in the coup attempts made to oust Saddam  since 1991. To encourage debate, Hiro appends frequent and  infrequent comments and questions on Iraq, together with  his own short answers. The questions Iraq submitted to the  UN secretary general in March 2002 are also reprinted.  Gandhi, freedom and self-rule  (Vistaar, Rs 190) edited by Anthony J. Parel  brings together eminent Gandhian scholars to discuss the  four meanings of freedom in Gandhis life and writings:  sovereign national independence, the political freedom of  the individual, freedom from poverty and spiritual freedom  or self-rule. Dennis Dalton, Antony Copley, Sudarshan Kapur  and Judith Brown are among the contributors. Last letters ofJacopo Ortis  (Hesperus,  5.99) by Ugo Foscolo is another  one of those unknown gems in the 100 Pages series. Foscolo  (1778-1827), was an Italian Romantic and a passionate advocate  of the liberation of his nation from foreign occupation.  He went into self-imposed exile in Switzerland, and then  in England, where he died in poverty and despair. Jacopo  Ortis is Foscolos Young Werther or Childe Harold, banished  from his homeland and from the woman he loves, living constantly  with insufferable feelings of disillusionment and betrayal.  Foscolo uses the form of an epistolary monologue to embody  in Ortis the crisis of the revolutionary hopes of an entire  generation and the death of an idea of freedom based on  human trust and love. Like Beeth- ovens Leonora, Ortis  is a Romantic who wages war on convention to in an attempt  to liberate mankind from the fetters of society, nature  and fate. J.G. Nicholss translation appends the splendidly  gloomy elegy, The Tomb: Shaded by cypresses, and  kept in urns/ Consoled by weeping, is the sleep of death/  Really not quite so rigid?

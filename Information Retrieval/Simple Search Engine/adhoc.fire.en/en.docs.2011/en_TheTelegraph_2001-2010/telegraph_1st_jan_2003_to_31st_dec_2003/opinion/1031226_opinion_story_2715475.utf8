 Kaushik Roy				 	 On guard																								THE DEFENCE MAKEOVER: 10 MYTHS THAT SHaPE INDIAS IMAGE By Pravin Sawhney, Sage, Rs 425																								There is a general consensus among security analysts that the post-Cold War era is witnessing a deterioration in Indias strategic environment. But scholars differ regarding the nature of security challenges that India faces. Is China or Pakistan the principal threat to India? What about Indias nuclear capabilities vis--vis Pakistan? Pravin Sawhney, a former army officer turned strategic analyst, attempts to address the above mentioned issues in the book.																								Sawhney accepts George Fernandezs position that China is Indias number one threat in the long run. Without Chinas political, diplomatic, economic and military support, Pakistan would not be able to do much against India. China and India have an unresolved border problem. China claims 90,000 square kilometres of Indias territory. In 1986, China occupied Sumdorung Chu in Arunachal Pradesh. When the flamboyant chief of army staff, General Sundarji, decided to evict the Chinese, Lieutenant-General V.N. Sharma, in-charge of the Eastern command asked how he would react in case the Peoples Liberation Army used tactical nuclear weapons. Rajiv Gandhi and Sundarji had no answer. As a result, India backed off.																								Sawhney claims that in case a limited border war erupts between India and China in the near future, PLA will not use strategic nuclear warheads against targets deep inside India. But it might resort to tactical nukes in battlefields in the high Himalayas. Which means the Indian army requires tactical nukes. But, most of the Indian nuclear theorists are against India possessing them. 																								Sawhney argues that the collapse of the Soviet Union enabled China to re-deploy troops from its northern border to Tibet. The PLA is 2.2 million strong, compared to the 1.2 million Indian force. Besides, a large number of Indian units are engaged in counter-insurgency operations. Once Beijing solves the Taiwan issue, Sawhney fears, China will turn against India.																								Beijings policy is to pre-empt any economic and diplomatic competition from India by keeping Delhi limited to the subcontinent. This is achieved by encouraging Pakistan to keep India engaged. According to Sawhney, the Indian army enjoys no edge over the Pakistan army so far as conventional warfare is concerned. For this, the Pakistanis need to thank China, which is supplying military hardware at friendly prices. In contrast, Moscow can no longer offer arms to India at a subsidized price. 																								Sawhney agrees with the view that the high attitude war in Siachen glacier is a blunder for India. India is losing more heavily than Pakistan both in money and manpower. In 1984, Lieutenant General Hoon initiated an ambitious operation which culminated in the partial occupation of Siachen. Indira Gandhi accepted the Hoon plan because she wanted to show off to China and Pakistan. However, Indias military and political top brass failed to consider the long term consequences of flexing muscles in Siachen. The net result is India spending Rs 40 million daily at Siachen.																								It is difficult to agree with Sawhneys assertion that to acquire a few square kilometres of desolate mountainous and forested territory, Beijing would use tactical nukes. If the Indian army penetrates deep inside Tibet, only then would the PLA resort to tactical nukes. However, the Indian army lacks the capacity and Indian politicians lack the political will to think of launching counter-attacks in Tibet for checkmating Chinese incursions into India.																								To conclude, Sawhneys main thrust that China is the principal threat needs to be considered seriously. Although one may disagree with Sawhney, this book will keep one thinking. In the new millennium we can no more afford to overlook the red threat along our northern border.						KAUSHIK ROY

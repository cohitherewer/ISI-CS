The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, September 05, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																I havent the slightest ideaMemoirs of an egotist (Hesperus,  6.99) by Stendhal starts with a series of lightly self-indulgent questions: What kind of a man am I? Do I have common sense, do I have common sense and profundity too? Am I remarkably witty? Truth to tell, I havent the slightest idea. This delightful blankness leads Stendhal to examine my conscience with pen in hand, and put down a random memoir of his life in Paris from 1821 to 1830. The result is a Byronic/Napoleonic jaunt, also reminiscent of Sterne and Diderot, ending in a vision of the egotists gravestone  a marble slab in the shape of a playing card  with the following inscription: The only things I have passionately loved in my life are: Cimarosa, Mozart and Shakespeare. Middle East illusions: peace,  security and terror (Penguin, Rs 295) by Noam  Chomsky collects the writings of this linguist and philosopher,  from the late Sixties to the present, on the Israel-Palestine  conflict and the crucial American role as it has evolved  in the past 35years. A critique of the definitions of terror,  and the links between these definitions and international  policy remain the fundamental concerns of these writings.  The book ends with After 9/11: The War on Terror Redeclared. I speak for the devil (Penguin,  Rs 195) by Imtiaz Dharker is a slim volume of  poems drawing on the writers political, cultural and sexual  experience spanning Pakistan, Britain and India. The content  of her poetry is personally and politically important, though  familiar and often predictable. Injustice  in this case,  done mostly to a womans body  engenders powerful sentiments,  but it does not always produce excellent poetry. Its time  to face up to this./ The century was a bitch./ Thank god  its dead and gone/ with its tail/ between its legs/ under  a plastic tombstone. There are reasonably good, but cliched,  drawings by the poet.The Harpercollins Travel Guides:  Himachal; Ladakh; Kumaon amp; Garhwal (HarperCollins,  Rs 195 each) are handy little books, each of which presents  an Indian state decoded and demystified for the traveller,  complete with directions et al and in as few words as possible.  While each trail is customized for those who prefer to drive,  it also provides information about train, bus and air connections.  There are enticing photographs and a wealth of essential  updated information regarding accommodation (lots of phone  numbers). An excellent series.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, December 27, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Greener on the other side				 																																																				Sir  Elizabeth Taylor has never been known for her loyalty or for sticking to her word. Which is why her show of solidarity  coming soon after her decision not to comment  with the beleaguered Michael Jackson does not cut much ice. It is no surprise that a celebrity like Jackson has many celebrity friends, and has the money to buy many more (Jackson friends gather in support, Dec 22). But he is also the one who knows best that in Hollywood, taking sides only to do a volte face later is as common as buying million-dollar properties.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Aashish Majumder, Calcutta
				 																Money matters				 																																																				Sir  This year has been particularly good for the Indian economy, especially in terms of the foreign exchange accumulation (Forex figure scales historic high, Dec 21). This is a remarkable achievement when one considers how, in the Nineties, these very reserves were abysmally low at $1 billion only. India has come a long way since then and is now being considered as one of the most promising emerging markets in the world economy. The policies pursued by the government and the central bank have an important role to play in turning the situation around. Hopefully, India will not have to pledge its gold to meet international debt obligations any more  a practice which was common only a decade or so ago. Among the specific economic reforms, the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, which has given way to the more realistic Foreign Exchange Management Act, is largely responsible for the changed scenario. 				 																																																				But the euphoria must be balanced with caution. An appreciating rupee in these circumstances has important policy implications. The governments economists should try to use the experience of the former finance minister, Manmohan Singh, who had bailed the economy out of a crisis in 1991. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The rising forex reserves may be good news for the country, but attention must be paid to inflation, which is an invariable fallout of a heavy increase in foreign exchange. This is because the government has to keep buying up the excess dollars flowing into the economy in order to keep the exchange rate unchanged. In the process, the additional rupees introduced into the economy make the inflation rate move north. The government must put its checks in place to prevent this.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A. Mandal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The North Block and the Reserve Bank of India deserve to pat each other on the back for the forex reserves of the country crossing the $100 billion mark (Price of success, Dec 23). This comes as an immense relief to the country after the uncertain Nineties. The $100 billion in our kitty puts India on a different platform altogether in the international market. We may be placed fifth in the list of the emerging markets in the world, and China may continue to appear formidable, but with the current reform-oriented government at the Centre, moving up the ladder does not seem impossible. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The fake currency racket has finally caught up with Calcutta. Not just 100-rupee notes, but fake 500-rupee ones are also in circulation. Why is the RBI or the state government not taking concrete action against this? Newer security design features ought to be introduced after consulting specialists in this area. This could redress the problem and allow the police to zero in on the operations of the racket. Besides, the people should be made more aware of the menace of the fake currency racket. This could be done by consistent audio-visual publicity of the issue where the methods of checking a note are also shown. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Research and Analysis Wings report to the Calcutta police stating how Calcutta has become a vital link in an Inter-Services Intelligence-engineered fake currency racket should be paid attention to by the state government. There have been strong indications that the notes are being printed in Karachi and possibly also in Bangladesh. The state government should take action on this in the same way that it had dealt with illegal immigrants from across the border. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Tanmoy Das, Calcutta

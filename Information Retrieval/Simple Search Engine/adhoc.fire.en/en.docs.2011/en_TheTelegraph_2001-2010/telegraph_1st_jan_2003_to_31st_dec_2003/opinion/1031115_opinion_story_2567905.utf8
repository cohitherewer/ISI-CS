		 Saturday, November 15, 2003  WARNINGS FROM AMBEDKAR
 - Why Amitava Lala is actually an Ambedkarite  Politics and play / Ramachandra  Guha ramguhavsnl.com Grammarian of anarchy  Sometimes popular worship and  admiration does great disservice to the object of adoration.  Take Rabindranath Tagore. No bhadralok considers  himself worth his hilsa if he has not read Tagores novels  and plays, if he cannot sing his songs. Bengalis, in general,  have a distinctly proprietorial attitude towards Tagore,  which, in my view, distinctly diminishes him. Yes, he revolutionized  the Bengali language. Yes, he more-or-less redefined Bengali  literature. And yes, he wrote some exquisite poetry in Bengali  and many not-so-exquisite songs. But beyond all this, he  was a thinker of a truly universal reach and significance.  His writings on culture, education and nationalism can be  read with profit in Copenhagen or Caracas as much as in  Calcutta. Another Indian who has suffered  from being made a sectarian icon is B.R. Ambedkar. He is  worshipped by Dalits across the land; his picture adorning  cobblers shops, his name marking out village streets where  live his followers and caste-fellows. His posthumous reputation  is in striking contrast to that of his greatest political  rival. Thus, as the Bangalore critic, V.T. Rajesekhar, points  out, Gandhi Jayanti is now an official function in which  some old bandicoots reluctantly gather and deliver some  hypocritical speeches sitting inside a closed room. Within  an hour or so, it is all over. Compared to that, Babasaheb  Ambedkars Jayanti is a massive day-long open-air celebration  attended by thousands of Dalits spending their own money. The Dalits honour Ambedkar as  an opponent of the caste system. So should we, but in truth  he was much more than that. The Dalit capture of the man  should not blind us to the fact that he was also an economist  of ability and a political theorist of range and subtlety.  There are aspects of his work and thought specifically addressed  to the emancipation of Dalits; and other aspects that apply  with equal force to non-Dalits as well. Consider, in this connection,  Ambedkars final speech to the constituent assembly of India.  As chairman of the drafting committee of the Constitution,  Ambedkar did his job with both distinction and efficiency.  In the last session of the assembly, he was showered with  extravagant praise. Among the epithets he was granted, at  least one he would have disdained, that of being the modern  Manu. For his modernist sensibilities were deeply at odds  with that of the ancient law-giver of the Hindus; indeed,  one of his first significant political acts (back in 1927)  was to publicly burn the Manusmriti itself. On November 25, 1949, the day  before the assembly wound up its proceedings, Ambedkar made  a moving speech summing up their work. He thanked his fellow  members of the drafting committee, thanked their support  staff, and thanked a party of which he had been a life-long  opponent. Without the quiet work in and out of the house  by the party bosses, he would not have been able to render  order out of chaos. It is because of the discipline of  the Congress Party that the drafting committee was able  to pilot the Constitution in the Assembly with the sure  knowledge as to the fate of each article and each amendment. In a concession to patriotic nostalgia,  Ambedkar then allowed that some form of democracy was not  unknown in ancient India. There was a time when India was  studied with republics, he said; and even monarchies were  limited, not absolute. Characteristically, he invoked the  Buddhists, who to him had furthered the democratic ideal  in their bhikshu sanghas, which applied rules akin  to those of parliamentary procedure votes, motions, resolutions,  censures, whips. Ambedkar also assured the house  that the federalism of the Constitution in no way denied  states rights. It was mistaken, he said, to think that  there was too much centralization and that the States have  been reduced to municipalities. The Constitution had partitioned  legislative and executive authority, but the provinces were  in no way dependent on the Union, and the Centre could not  alter the boundary of this partition. In his words, The  Centre and the States are co-equal in this matter. Ambedkar ended his speech with  three warnings about the future. I shall offer them here  in reverse order. His last warning was to urge us not to  be content with what he called mere political democracy.  India had got rid of alien rule, but it was still riven  by inequality and hierarchy. Thus, once the country formally  became a republic on January 26, 1950, it was going to  enter a life of contradictions. In politics we will have  equality and in social and economic life we will have inequality.  In politics we will be recognizing the principle of one  man one vote and one vote one value. In our social and economic  life, we shall, by reason of our social and economic structure,  continue to deny the principle of one man one value. How  long shall we continue to live this life of contradictions?  How long shall we continue to deny equality in our social  and economic life? If we continue to deny it for long, we  will do so only by putting our political democracy in peril. The second warning concerned the  unthinking submission to charismatic authority. Ambedkar  quoted John Stuart Mill, who cautioned citizens not to  lay their liberties at the feet of even a great man, or  to trust him with powers which enable him to subvert their  institutions. This warning, he said, was even more pertinent  here than in England, for in India, Bhakti or what may  be called the path of devotion or hero-worship, plays a  part in its politics unequalled in magnitude by the part  it plays in the politics of any other country in the world.  Bhakti in religion may be the road to the salvation of a  soul. But in politics, Bhakti or hero-worship is a sure  road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship. Both these warnings were strikingly  prescient. For while elections continue to be held, and  voter participation rates continue to increase, the exploitation  of low castes and women has scarcely abated. Whatever the  Constitution might say, the value attached to a Brahmin  man is still often higher in practice than to a Dalit woman.  The caution about hero-worship has likewise been disregarded.  Indians have been too willing to apply Bhakti to politics,  to lay their liberties at the feet of a not-so-great man  or woman. Hence the rise to power of such authoritarians  as MGR and NTR, Jayalalithaa and Mayavati, and Bal Thackeray. I come, in the end, to Ambedkars  first warning, which concerned the place of popular protest  in a democracy. There was no place for bloody revolution,  of course, but in his view there was no room for Gandhian  methods either. We must abandon the method of civil disobedience,  non-cooperation and satyagraha, he said. Under an autocratic  regime, there might be some justification for them, but  not now, when constitutional methods of redressal were available.  Satyagraha and the like, said Ambedkar, were nothing  but the Grammar of Anarchy and the sooner they are abandoned,  the better for us. After Independence, the Gandhians  retreated to their ashrams. But the Gandhian techniques  of protest have been used by a wide variety of political  groups. Not least the communists of Bengal. In the late  Forties, they preached bloody insurrection; but in a few  years they had changed their minds. It was while working  with the East Bengal refugees that they first adapted, for  their own purposes, Gandhian methods of protest. As Prafulla  Chakrabarti writes, in the early Fifties Calcutta became  the city of processions, the nightmare city. Processions,  demonstrations and meetings, traffic jams, brickbats and  teargas shells and lathis coming down in showers, burning  tramcars and buses, and occasional firings  these became  the hallmark of the city. The anger of the refugees was  in good part justifiable. But what their leaders began has  continued down the years, often with much less reason. The  culture of cholbe na has made Calcutta a city of  processions without purpose. What was once legitimate protest  has now become the Grammar of Anarchy. Hence the recent  judgment of the Calcutta high court, and hence also the  massive and perhaps undying controversy around it. My modest  contribution to the debate is this hitherto unnoticed point:  that Mr Justice Amitava Lala is an Ambedkarite.

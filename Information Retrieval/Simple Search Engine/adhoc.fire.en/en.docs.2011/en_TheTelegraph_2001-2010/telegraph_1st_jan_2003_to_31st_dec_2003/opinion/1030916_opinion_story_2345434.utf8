		 Tuesday, September 16, 2003  Uncertain prospects
 - India should help Sri Lanka to negotiate with the LTTE from  a position of strength  J.N. DIXIT The author is former foreign secretary  of India The senior advisor on foreign  and security affairs to the president of Sri Lanka and former  foreign minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar, was in New Delhi  in the middle of July to deliver the Prem Bhatia Memorial  Lecture. His subject was the international and regional  situation, post-Iraq war. General reports were that he was  concerned with the difficult military and political situation  affecting the tenuous peace process brokered by the Norwegians  in Sri Lanka. Kadirgamar had an exchange of views with the  national security advisor, Brajesh Mishra, the foreign minister,  Yashwant Sinha, the foreign secretary, Kanwal Sibal, and  the deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani. He also met K. Natwar  Singh, chairman of the foreign affairs department of the  All India Congress Committee. Bilateral talks between the Sri  Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam  have been stalemated over the last three or four months  because of various procedural and political reasons. The  political reasons are: first, the delay by the Sri Lankan  authorities in sending proposals for the interim governance  of the northern and eastern provinces, details of the subjects  which would be delegated to the Tamil authority in the northeastern  provinces. Then, when the proposals were sent, the LTTE  did not find them satisfactory. The LTTE are in the process  of submitting alternative proposals to the Sri Lankan government  for the first time since 1987. The second political reason is  the differences of opinion between the Sri Lankan government  and the LTTE about the location of each others troops and  camps and the redeployment of military forces. The Sri Lankan  government is concerned that the LTTE is violating the ceasefire  agreement by setting up new camps particularly in the Trincomallee  region. Jaffna in any case is militarily and geo-strategically  dominated by the LTTE cadre with the exception of the Fort  and the Palaley air base. The LTTE has not only strengthened  its existing military bases in Trincomallee, but it has  also set up 13 to 14 new bases despite the memorandum of  understanding on the ceasefire stipulating that no new military  bases will be set up by either side. These 13 or 14 bases are in addition  to the LTTE strengthening another 14 bases in the same region.  The location of these new LTTE bases is such that these  flank the Sri Lankan armys military positions and can become  launching pads endangering the Trincomallee port itself.  The third political problem is the profound division of  opinion in Sri Lankan political parties and Sri Lankan public  opinion about the proposals for a compromise with the LTTE. There have been changes in the  power structure within the LTTE also. Anton Balasingham,  according to most recent reports, stands marginalized from  the main process of negotiations. Velupillai Prabhakaran  has nominated his political advisor, Tamilchelvam, to be  the leading figure in internal discussions within the LTTE  as well as with Sinhalese delegations. Tamilchelvam is being  assisted by Karuna, the head of the LTTEs military cadre  in the eastern province. Balasingham apparently was not  in favour of the very tough anti-government stand taken  by Prabhakaran by pulling back from bilateral discussions  three months ago. Tamil- chelvam and Karuna replacing him  manifest the hardening of the negotiating position of the  LTTE.  The LTTE held an internal meeting  in Paris in mid-August to prepare counter-proposals to the  suggestions made by the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe.  In any case, Wickremesinghes proposals were off the mark  in terms of acceptability by the LTTE or even other Tamil  groups because his proposals did not say anything about  delegating authority to the northeastern provincial interim  government on management of land, law and order and some  of the more sensitive financial subjects. The LTTEs counter-proposals are  likely to demand delegation of authority not only on these  but also on additional subjects including part of the defence  arrangements of the Tamil areas. There is likely to be a  qualitative gap between the LTTEs demands and the offers  made by the Sri Lankan government. The Buddhist clergy,  the president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, and her party are  deeply concerned about excessive compromise with the LTTE  because they apprehend the division of Sri Lanka and creation  of the Eelam through this covert process of political osmosis. Meanwhile, the ground situation  in terms of military capacities is in a flux and decidedly  to the advantage of the LTTE. While the Sri Lankan armed  forces remain engaged in their routine security duties,  and in maintaining basic security requirements in the tactical  areas of responsibility, the LTTE has decidedly utilized  the ceasefire to strengthen itself in terms of personnel  as well as supplies. The LTTE now has a sufficient number  of longer-range weapons, including mortar and 120 millimetre  artillery guns. The LTTE has converted their temporary transit  bases and routes in Jaffna in the east into permanent military  bases. The LTTEs maritime activities around the coast of  northern and eastern Sri Lanka have been on the increase  under the protection of their navy known as Sea Tigers. These maritime activities include  the transporting of cadre and materials disguised as fishermen  and civilians. According to Sri Lankan government sources,  LTTE infiltrators and reconnaissance teams are utilizing  their freedom of movement to improve and expand their intelligence  operations against the Sri Lankan government. The LTTE is  also now in possession of what are known as suicide boats.  The LTTEs total strength, leaving aside the strength of  2,000-3,000 in Jaffna, in Trincomallee is now about 1550  cadres. The Sea Tigers have three attack gunboats and six  suicide craft ready for operation in the eastern sector.  The LTTE also has micro-light aircraft which can be utilized  for suicide attacks on Sri Lankan military bases. On all counts, the LTTE has utilized  the Norwegian brokered ceasefire to enhance its cadre and  regroup themselves, to acquire more military supplies and  to deploy its cadre in new positions with better equipment,  which puts the Sri Lankan armed forces more or less on the  defensive. The Sri Lankan armed forces cannot  take any counter-action or pre-emptive operations against  the LTTE activities because of the ceasefire. The officers  cadre of the Sri Lankan army are incrementally worried about  the more recent military developments. The political and  military wing of the LTTE is confident. It is dealing with  the Sri Lankan armed forces on a more or less equal footing.  Prabhakaran is on record saying, at the end of July, that  if talks fail, the LTTE has the ability to revert to the  military option. Despite the existence of other  Tamil political parties in Sri Lanka, and some of them,  like the Eelam Peoples Democratic Party, being represented  in parliament, the LTTE has been recognized by the Sri Lankan  government as the main representative of Sri Lankan Tamils,  a status which, by implication, has been internationally  recognized because of the Norwegian exercise of accepting  the LTTE as the main negotiators from the Tamils side.  This was political realism, but it has legitimized the LTTEs  claims of representation regarding Sri Lankan Tamils. The question arises as to why  the LTTE participated in the Norwegian peace initiative  and why it is continuing its participation in the negotiations  despite its known stren- gths and uncompromising negotiating  position on certain Tamil issues. The main reason is the  LTTE having been on the list of terrorist organizations  designated by the United States of America. After September  11, 2001, the LTTEs position became incrementally vulnerable  because of this categorization. External support to the  organization from the Tamil diaspora in west Europe, North  America and the Asia Pacific region was also affected by  stringent punitive stipulations against organizations and  entities supporting terrorist organizations, particularly  those designated as such by the US government. So it is  logical for the LTTE to take every step to eliminate its  description as terrorist organization and to gain legitimacy  as a political entity. But this objective will not make  the LTTE compromise on some of its basic demands sustained  for nearly three decades. The macro-level objective of the  LTTE remains the creation of a separate Tamil state in Sri  Lanka over a period of time. Whether this would be decisive  to the security of Sri Lanka or the ethno-cultural unity  of India is a legitimate question. The answer obviously  has to be negative because the centrifugal forces generated  by such an event can have cascading ramifications on subcontinental  south Asia. The Sri Lankan government has the support of  a majority of countries in the world to sustain its unity  and territorial integrity. The only rider being that the  Sri Lankan government offers a compromise to Sri Lankan  Tamils which should be responsive to their political, cultural  and economic aspirations. An additional relevant factor  is that the world is not likely to endorse the LTTEs political  and constitutional demands, which may border on the creation  of a separate Tamil state. India should remain supportive  of the peace process subject to these realities. India should  also strengthen the Sri Lankan government in political and  logistical terms so that the Sri Lankan government also  negotiates from a position of strength with the LTTE in  the coming weeks.

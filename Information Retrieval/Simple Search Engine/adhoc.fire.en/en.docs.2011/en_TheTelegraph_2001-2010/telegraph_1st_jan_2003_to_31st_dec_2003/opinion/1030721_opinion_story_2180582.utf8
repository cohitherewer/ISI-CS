		 Monday, July 21, 2003  ITS YESTERDAY ONCE MORE
 Iraq could already be on its way to  becoming the second Vietnam following Mao Zedongs formula  of a peoples war, argues Orville Schell  The author has written numerous books  on China, covered the war in Indochina and is now dean of  the Graduate School of Journalism, University of California,  Berkeley		 The road from SalgonWhile the preparation for the  American invasion of Iraq was going on, there was a tendency  to dismiss those few voices who warned against getting bogged  down in a quagmire. The swift conclusion of the shock and  awe campaign, fortified by symbolic events like the fall  of Saddam Husseins statues in Baghdad, seemed to leave  skeptics of an early and complete military victory tarred  as irredeemably false prophets. However, two months after the  official end of the Iraq war, with the loss of nearly  180 coalition troops and a large number of wounded men,  these once discounted prophets of gloom now suddenly seem  far more sage in their predictions than they were made to  appear when they first annunciated their cautionary warnings.  Talk of guerrilla warfare, body counts, and escalations  of troop force has now replaced gloating about the success  of our initial invasion and the wonders of precision-guided  munitions. By all accounts it now seems that Iraq may be  witnessing the beginning of a peoples war that is hauntingly  reminiscent of the genre perfected by Mao Zedong and Ho  Chi Minh during the middle of the last century. Here, I must declare a certain  self-interest. On March 31, as troops were moving towards  Baghdad, I wrote a column in the San Francisco Chronicle  saying that the US could well become entrapped in a guerrilla  war whose hallmark was sand and cities rather than mud and  villages. I was roundly condemned at the time by quite a  few readers as overly-negative and misguided, not to say  unpatriotic. Several respondents wondered what possible  relevance the theory and practice of guerrilla war, as formulated  and practised in such places as China and Indochina might  now have for Iraq. The abyss between quagmire and sand,  it seemed, strained their credulity. What seemed to have been overlooked  at the time was the fact that guerrilla warfare has been  the only way weaker forces have ever managed to confront  more powerful forces. Yet, despite numerous warnings by  Iraqi officials at the time, few in the Bush administration  took them seriously. People say to me, You are not  the Vietnamese. You have no jungles and swamps, Iraqs  deputy prime minister told a British researcher six months  before the war began. I reply, Let our cities be our swamps  and our buildings be our jungles. How did the sands of the Iraqi  desert turn so unexpectedly into a quagmire? The idea of  guerrilla war first made a beachhead in the theory of modern  warfare when Napoleon invaded Spain in 1807 and met fierce  resistance from Spanish irregulars in what the French called  la petite guerre. The Spanish invented a new word  when they dubbed their struggle against the French occupiers  as a guerrilla. As the participants in the nascent  Chinese Communist movement fought for their lives against  Chiang Kai-shek in the Twenties, Mao Zedong took up on this  tradition in an Asian setting. Maos answer to conventional  pitched battles was a form of both mobile and protracted  warfare that won through harassment rather than outright  victories. And, although far weaker and less well-equipped,  the Red Army did ultimately outlast both the invading Japanese  army and the Nationalist government. The ingredients of this new kind  of asymmetrical warfare were: stealth, decentralization,  surprise, mobility, and deception. Above all, counselled  Mao, weaker forces should avoid major engagements and settle  instead with a victory of attrition by means of repeated,  small-scale raids. Elaborating on the teachings of  the classical Chinese strategist, Sun Zi, Mao wrote: The  enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass;  the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue. Maos triumph in China helped  proliferate an almost mythic legacy of peoples war, one  that Americans confronted in an agonizing way in Indochina  as we fought a convert to Maoist strategy, General Vo Nguyen  Giap, who led the Vietnamese communist forces. Such a strategy is precisely what  anti-American forces and Saddams supporters have begun  to use in Iraq. But what may prove to be even more disruptive  of coalition plans are Baath Party supporters intent on  engaging in urban guerrilla warfare  even suicide bombing   as US and British troops find themselves bogged down in  cities trying to build a peace. In late March, Saddam himself  issued a statement to Iraqi tribesmen telling them to attack  coalition troops in small groups, to hit their frontlines  and their rear units so the whole advance will stop. And  when it stops, attack them. Few members of either the press  or the Bush administration took these words seriously. If  over the last few days of the official invasion, the United  States of Americas military planners came to view irregular  forces like the Fedayeen Saddam and the Special Republican  Guard commandos as a major annoyance, the US is now beginning  to get a clearer sense of the kind of problems such insurgents  can create during the process of nation building. Indeed,  US efforts to restore basic utility services and to get  ministries and local governments functioning again have  been delayed far beyond original expectations. One of the most important ingredients  in Maos conception of guerrilla warfare was nationalism,  a sentiment that is almost always excited by foreign incursion.  As in the case of the Fedayeen Saddam (Saddams men of  sacrifice) and whomever else it is that is now attacking  US soldiers in Iraq, Mao realized that the Chinese could  be induced to make heroic sacrifices when goaded by the  indignity of an occupation, which in Chinas case involved  the Japanese. Few countries have ever welcomed  foreign airstrikes, invasion and occupation, and history  is replete with occasions when nationalism trumped even  a peoples loathing of dictatorship to challenge interlopers.  No greater examples exist than Napoleons and Hitlers failed  invasions of Russia. We know that Saddam Hussein is  a student of Stalin, but it now looks as if he and Tariq  Aziz had also been reading a little Mao on the side. And  it is a stunning lapse that as US leaders planned to topple  him by military means, the Bush administration did not understand  that Saddam, his supporters, and anti-American Muslims throughout  the Islamic world would inevitably turn to guerrilla warfare  to defend Arab dignity, if not Saddams benighted regime. What we may now see is an internationalization  of the Iraqi conflict. Iraq may increasingly become a magnet  not only for angry Iraqi nationalists who find anyone more  acceptable than American occupiers, but also for a whole  host of politically extreme groups  Islamic fundamentalist  sects like the Hezbollah, the Wahabi militants, and even  remnants of the taliban, ever looking for the easiest and  most high-visibility way to damage the US. One suspects that we will be hearing  much more about counter-insurgency, body counts, the need  for troop escalations, and winning the hearts and minds  of the people in the months to come. This is, of course,  the almost forgotten language of Vietnam, not to say of  Spain in the early 19th century or of Asia in the 20th century.  More and more what seems to be developing in Iraq is the  progeny of a whole history and tradition of guerrilla warfare. However, unlike the protracted  insurgency in Vietnam, where there was always some official  entity with whom to negotiate, in Iraq there is no discernible  organized force with whom to talk. We are confronted with  a disaggregated phantom, a hybrid of terrorism and guerrilla  warfare which may well prove even harder to extirpate than  the guerrilla armies we confronted in Indochina.

 - The importance of form in a democracy should not be underestimated  Pratap Bhanu Mehta The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University Signifying something  Although the outcome of the no-confidence  motion was never in doubt, the debate itself was not entirely  devoid of suspense and guilty pleasures. The source of suspense  was not the end result, but the manner in which the different  protagonists would reveal themselves. What would be the  Congresss line of attack? Would we finally learn what Sonia  Gandhi actually thinks? How would the smaller parties position  themselves? Which new weapon in the arsenal of belligerence  would the National Democratic Alliance employ? But the real  source of fun was the astonishing fact that almost every  single politician who spoke incriminated himself. The easiest  way to rebut any speaker was to impugn their moral authority  on the subject on which they were speaking. If this debate  revealed anything it was the extraordinary fact that almost  our entire political class lives in glass houses, and yet  throws stones. Sonia Gandhi began promisingly  and we got something resembling a speech. But it was very  difficult to shake off the impression that the Congress  still has a steep climb ahead if it wants to occupy the  high moral ground. Corruption, defence lapses, riot victims,  slow economic growth are hardly issues on which the Congress  carries any imprimatur of conviction. Sonia Gandhis challenge  was to restore credibility to the Congress, and emancipate  it from its own recent past. By that yardstick she failed  miserably. Her only significant intervention, apart from  the read speech, was a vague insinuation that many significant  detainees during Emergency had asked Indira Gandhi for clemency.  In the absence of any evidence, this insinuation was particularly  inept, but as an ideological signal it was even more of  a disaster. Only someone in a cognitive time warp could  think that asking for mercy from prison was a worse assault  on this democracy than the Emergency itself.  Her criticism of economic reforms,  took the credit away from one of the few good things the  Congress did. It may have worked well as a signal to potential  allies on the left, but it also revealed that the Congress  does not know where it stands. In the end the debate proved  to be a successful assault on her credentials, more than  it was an attack on the government. Chandra Shekhar somberly tried  to remind the house that these proceedings were a farce.  Why go on with them, when all parliamentary conventions  were being flouted, when matters of graver substance than  an audit report had been passed over in silence by the house?  Good question. But coming from someone who, as caretaker  prime minister, bypassed Parliament to indulge in an economically  myopic spending spree, this solicitude for parliamentary  convention seemed about as insincere as Narendra Modis  profession of secularism would be.  Vijay Kumar Malhotra, whose speaking  style might have come from a Bollywood role scripted for  Amrish Puri, had the audacity to accuse the communists of  being traitors to Mahatma Gandhis Quit India movement;  never mind if the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh legitimized  his assassination. The smaller parties were engaged in the  bizarre logic of boycotting the defence minister and then  claiming that he had not defended himself to their satisfaction.  Listening to speech after speech seemed almost surreal:  as if there was no ground for anyone to stand on. As a pure sparring match the NDA  won hands down. The Congress is curiously bereft of imaginative  speakers. Its front benches consist of Shivraj Patil, who  appears to have more faith in his command over the technical  rules of the house than on the substance of the issues;  Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who unfortunately is much heard  but rarely understood, and S. Jaipal Reddy, earnest and  well meaning but no capacity for being succinct or precise.  No match for the brazenness of Vijay Malhotra, the charming  clarity of Sushma Swaraj, the trade union histrionics and  dramatic flourishes of George Fernandes and the graveness  of Advani and Vajpayee. Alas, if this were an election debate  the choice comes down to this: a Bharatiya Janata Party  whose ideology is destructive and a Congress that is destructive  by having no ideology or leadership.  Still, in an odd sense this debate  was reassuring. It was very tempting to dismiss the whole  thing as a self-serving charade in which people are the  victims. But as Clifford Geertz once wrote of the Balinese  theatre state, their dramas were mimetic of themselves;  they were, in the end, neither illusions nor lies, nor sleight  of hand, nor make believe. They were what there was. The  debate itself was in substantive terms undoubtedly something  of a farce, more like WWF wrestling than a real combat.  Each side pretended to hit and the other pretended to feel  wounded.  But the conventions that allowed  this drama to proceed were in the end more important than  what those conventions were used for. It was difficult to  shake off the feeling that this was, in the final analysis,  a ritual fight amongst friends. The disruptions were choreographed,  the sense of outrage members displayed were stylized, and  you can imagine all the members having a good laugh together  after they have had a good shout. It might be objected that  all this is a distraction from real and pressing problems,  but that objection already presupposes that there is a distinction  between the ritual and the practical organization of the  state. It is a distinction that would be lost on most politicians  and perhaps most voters; the rituals are what makes us who  we are. What binds us is not the interests we share but  the rituals we participate in. More than the insidious duplicities  of our political class, the debate revealed the true secret  of our democracy. It is contained in those suggestive three  words repeatedly invoked by all parties, Mr Speaker, point  of order. This was the mantra that all parties could  recite, whose authority they could all defer to, and the  only thing that provided a modicum of restraint for the  cacophony of positions and adolescent interruptions.  So long as points of order are  admissible the show can go on. They can allow us to survive  the onslaughts of veniality, incompetence and even occasional  murderousness. This may be a slender thread on which to  place the burdens of democracy, but this is all we have.  As Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, men living in democratic  countries do not readily understand the utility of forms;  they feel an instinctive contempt for them. Forms arouse  their disdain. They rush impetuously toward the object of  each of their desire and delays exasperate themYet it is  this inconvenience that men of democracies find in forms  makes them so useful to liberty, their principal merit being  to serve as a barrier between the strong and the weak. Thus  democratic peoples have more need for forms than other peoples  and naturally respect them less. It is perhaps inevitable that  we express our contempt for the forms that our Parliament  enacted. The characterization of these proceedings as all  form and no substance would not be inaccurate. But to lament  this fact too much would be to go too far. The victory of  form over substance is still a condition vastly preferable  to a condition where substance triumphs with no formal restraints  whatsoever. We sometimes feel as if we are close to a condition  resembling Italy at the onset of Fascism in 1927 where a  contemporary observer said there are few who do not speak  ill of Parliaments. Parliament may have done little to  redeem itself, but that is all the more reason to cling  on to it as an institution with all your life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, February 12, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																A dicey tactic				 																																																				Sir  Statues of B.R. Ambedkar and casinos in five-star hotels  the Uttar Pradesh chief ministers vision of a Dalit paradise is rather eclectic (Mayavati gambles with casinos in cowbelt, Feb 10). Set aside crude moral compunctions, which have become unfashionable in todays globalized economy, where everything is subservient to the profit motive. But Mayavatis plan to allow gambling in five-star luxury hotels in the Taj economic zone, comprising Noida, Greater Noida and Agra, does not even make much economic sense. For one, it is infrastructure, and infrastructure alone  good roads, good and cheap hotels, less procedural hassles  that helps attract more tourists. Few Western tourists will come all the way to India  only to gamble. As for the domestic inflow, the ubiquitous lottery ticket is as far as most Indians will indulge their gambling instincts. Mayavati should realize that it is the Taj most Westerners come to see. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Radha Sen, Calcutta

				 																Truth under arrest				 																																																				Sir  Maulana Hussain Umarji, who was arrested recently on charges of being the main conspirator behind the burning of the Sabarmati Express on February 27, 2002, is the chief maulvi of Godhra (Plea for PM protection ends in Godhra net, Feb 7). After the train carnage, he apologized on behalf of his community at peace meetings convened by the collector of Godhra. He also took the lead in issuing a press statement signed by eminent Ghanchi Muslims of Godhra, in condemning the carnage, in praying for the souls of those who died, in praising the efforts of the Godhra authorities in maintaining peace and in running the Godhra relief camp. All through the months when violence raged around Godhra, the maulvi was busy day and night in running the two relief camps in the town, to which no Godhra Hindu made any monetary contribution. 				 																																																				Every day, the maulvi came across innocent women who had been raped and men who had lost their family-members only because they were Muslim. Despite all that, he made every effort to restrain the youth of his community who were straining at the leash to avenge the suffering of those pouring into the relief camps from nearby villages. It is this man who has been arrested, on the basis of an alleged statement by an accused in the incident. Never in the last 11 months did his name feature even once in the wild speculations about who burnt the train. Even if the maulvi comes out of custody with no charges against his name, the experience is unlikely to leave him or those who revere him, unscathed. Like the Congress earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party too seems adept in turning moderates into extremists.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jyoti Punwani, Mumbai 

				 																																																				Sir  Why does one get the feeling that there is more to Hussain Umarjis arrest than meets the eye? How very convenient for the police to have found the evidence to bear out its theory that Godhra was pre-meditated, albeit close to a year later? Or are these only pseudo-secularist scruples speaking? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Santanu Chakraborty, Ranchi

				 																Inane commentary				 																																																				Sir  One expects quality commentary at a prestigious international tournament like the World Cup. Unfortunately, the Set-Max commentary team lacks both expertise and articulation. This has killed much of the enthusiasm of viewers. Only Charu Sharma among them has a little knowledge of cricket. 				 																																																				If the idea was to provide some masala, surely there are better ways. Also, Donna Symmonds, the woman commentator, lacks conceptual understanding of the game. Cricket has always been a mans game, although womens cricket is being promoted a lot nowadays. Is it that Set-Max could not find the requisite man-power? Since this is only the beginning of the over-a-month long tournament, it is not too late to make changes in the commentary team. If the old horses were unavailable owing to tie-ups with other channels, there was no dearth of other technically sound former players to replace them.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The World Cup has begun in South Africa, and so have the worries of the parents of students due to take their board examinations. The youngsters eyes may be on the books, but their minds are on the television and scoreboard; and the examination schedule and World Cup fixture hang side-by-side on the wall. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

				 																																																				Sir  Will Sony Set-Max spare viewers the inanities of Charu Sharma, Maria Goretti and Mandira Bedi? They are difficult to take for those used to experts like Harsha Bhogle, Sunil Gavaskar, Ravi Shashtri and Navjyot Singh Sidhu. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Adhiraj Maitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  South Africas loss to West Indies in the first match of World Cup 2003 might have broken many hearts, but it must have been an eye-opener for both the home team and its supporters. It is a good sign that predictions are having to be revised this early in the tournament. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arup Saha, Guwahati

				 																																																				Sir  Such is the advertising hype surrounding the Indian team in South Africa  at least a dozen companies have come up with special campaigns  that one wonders what the reaction will be if the team fails. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

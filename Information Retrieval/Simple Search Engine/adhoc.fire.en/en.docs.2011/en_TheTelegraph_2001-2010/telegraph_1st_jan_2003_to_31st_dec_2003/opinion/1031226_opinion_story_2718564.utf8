		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 POLL LANGUAGE 
																								Language is identity. The Maithili-speaking people in north Bihar can now claim that their identity has been officially recognized since the Lok Sabha has given official recognition to Maithili. This announcement gives substance to a promise made by the prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in June in the heart of Maithili country. This recognition should have been bestowed a long time ago. If the strength of a language is known by its literature, then Maithili has always had very strong claims. The language is an old one with a very rich tradition of poetry from which other poets have borrowed. Rabindranath Tagore wrote one of his very early poems in a medium derived from Maithili even though native speakers of the language hold that the Bengali poet distorted the language. But writers all over eastern India have drawn from the fount of Maithili culture. The common elements between Bengali and Maithili are too well-known to be reiterated. It is somewhat unfortunate that it has taken so long for Maithili to receive the official stamp. This denial of official status to Maithili and its relegation for so long to the position of a mere dialect has resulted in Hindi getting an unnecessary privilege as the language of the Gangetic plain. Maithili has a longer history and a stronger claim to be an official language.																								At a rough count, nearly four crore people speak Maithili. They will now be able to use Maithili for official purposes. In other words, they will not be forced to use Hindi which is not the language of the region. This will give a new dignity to the Maithili-speaking people and to a region which has been the victim of natural disasters and governmental indifference. The recognition of Maithili at this point in time is imbricated in political calculations. Mr Kirti Azad, the member of parliament from Darbhanga in the Mithila region, emphasized the importance of the region to the National Democratic Alliance. The recognition comes as a direct counter to Mr Laloo Prasad Yadavs 1990 decision to drop Maithili from school and college curricula. North Bihar has shown a tendency to move away from the Rashtriya Janata Dal to the Bharatiya Janata Party. The recognition of Maithili will only hasten the process. Language will become politics.

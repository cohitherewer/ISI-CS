 - The US is seeking the cultural commitment of elites in west  Asia  Achin Vanaik The author is a political scientist,  and has recently published the book, Communalism Contested:  Religion, Modernity and Secularization On average one-and-a-half Americans  are dying daily in Iraq. In order to assuage growing resentment  at its occupation, the United States of America has just  announced that a transitional Iraqi government will be formed  by June 2004. President George W. Bush declared his administrations  abiding commitment to establishing democracy not only in  Iraq but in the region as a whole. What are we to make of  all this? There should be no illusions.  The US is not about to give up and get out of Iraq anytime  soon. They are there with a long-term commitment. This is  not Vietnam. There are no powerful countries nearby like  Russia and China willing to provide strong material support  for sustained resistance by the direct victims of occupation.  After Vietnam, US soldiery cannot suffer death rates in  the thousands, let alone tens of thousands, but it can and  will sustain death rates in the several hundreds. What is  more, unlike Indo-China, west Asia is geo-politically (the  pivot of Eurasia) and resource-wise (oil) far more strategically  important than Vietnam ever was, or was falsely made out  to be, in order to justify continued US aggression. In this very different era, the  stakes are much higher. The US is no longer aiming merely  to contain its principal rivals, but after the collapse  of the Soviet Union, is now out to establish a long-term  global dominance, effectively synonymous (as its most clear-headed  strategic thinkers openly declare) with domination of the  Eurasian landmass. In this respect, west Asia is the principal  problem. Hegemony in the longer run cannot rest on force.  It must involve consent but not just of the passive kind,  born of fear or a sense of powerlessness. It has to be an  active form of consent, that is to say, involving the internalization  of the belief that the US, despite its mistakes and occasional  high-handedness, is basically a force for good, with a society  to be admired and followed, albeit not perfect or without  significant flaws. This, after all, is the belief  held by many other developing country elites/middle classes,  from India to China. There may be some resentment at the  bullying aspects of US foreign policy, but the US remains  the model of economic prosperity and political liberties  that these elites/ middle classes take as the standard by  which to judge their own societies. It is this deeper cultural  internalization that gives the greatest guarantee that any  opposition to the USs global imperial project remains partial  and weak. It is always leavened by the willingness of developing  country elites (Russia can now be counted as a developing  country) and the governments they control, to offer cooperation  in the stabilization and institutionalization of this imperial  project in return for specific favours. This is considered  to be the realistic pursuit of national interest. Behind  it lies the fact that the US-backed project of neo-liberal  globalization also offers considerable benefits to developing  country capitalists (albeit as junior production partners  and/or as rentiers) and to the middle classes below them. What distinguishes west Asia from  all other parts of the world are two things. First, nowhere  else is there such deep hostility towards the US among the  elites/middle classes and the masses. And nowhere else are  American client regimes so isolated and bereft of public  support. The result is that though internal opposition may  be led by secular or Islamic leaderships, nevertheless resentment  against the US is common to both. Should any of the existing  client regimes from Saudi Arabia to Jordan to Egypt (even  the Syrian government is willing to basically tail the US  if the latter would let it) fall to their opponents, it  would mean a significant shift in the regional relationship  of forces and be seriously detrimental to the USs larger  imperial project. The invasion of Iraq must be seen  for what it is  not just the attempt to impose direct US  control on that country but as the first major act in a  wider effort to reorganize the USs regional domination  on securer, more hegemonic, that is, consensual lines.  That is why the constant White House refrain of wanting  to institutionalize democracy in west Asia. But the language  in which the message is repeatedly couched, equivalent to  older offensive tropes about the white mans burden and  bringing civilization to the savages, must not be dismissed  as merely a fraud. Democratization of west Asia, courtesy  Washington, is essentially a code word for this newer project  of institutionalizing hegemony via active consent. What this requires is the transformation  of the west Asian elites/middle classes in such a manner  that they are not simply tied economically to the US-promoted  neo-liberal world economy but become culturally committed  to the US. If west Asia could be remodelled in such a manner  that the US could take credit for helping to overthrow unpopular  regimes and to replace them with democratic governments  that provide much needed political liberties to their peoples,  then this, it is hoped, could more than compensate for the  persistence of deep economic and social divisions, and for  the continuation of foreign policies that sustain Israeli  regional dominance while denying genuine justice to the  Palestinians. This is not, by any means, a far-fetched perspective.  It is not necessary for the US to win the allegiance of  even a majority of the west Asian population, only of a  sizeable middle class. If along with this there is passive  consent among sufficient sections of the remainder, then  that will do nicely. It will assure longer-term stability  of democratic, but above all, pro-American regimes. What stands in the way of fulfilling  such a project? Three things. First, democratization cannot  guarantee the emergence of pro-US governments or the decline  of Muslim fundamentalist influence. There is no basic contradiction  between Muslim fundamentalism and the US, hence that other  history of US collaboration with fundamentalist forces and  regimes. But today the US is caught in a cleft stick of  its own making. The war against global terrorism is its  most powerful justification to the American public for direct  intervention and remodelling of west Asia.  But obtaining homeland support  in this way requires (and in civil society gets) constant  reference to the Islamic threat. Yet at the government-to-government  level, anti-Islamism makes it more difficult to obtain necessary  regime or popular support. The unilateralism of US foreign  policy, however, makes the former tactic more useful than  the latter even as it pushes Muslim fundamentalists and  moderate Muslims (itself an offensive term  who talks  of moderate Christians?) towards opposition.  Overall, therefore, democratization  will be pursued selectively and inconsistently. Indeed,  in the final analysis assuring clientelism (obedience to  US dictates) will trump genuine democratization wherever  the two are not compatible. Second, neo-liberal economic globalization  will not only exacerbate existing inequalities in west Asia  but ensure the absence of rising incomes for the poor. Compared  to the 1950-80 period, the dismal economic record of the  last two decades in this regard speaks for itself.  Finally, pan-Arabism, though long  dormant, politically speaking, survives as a trans-state,  mass-level emotion and sentiment whose principal glue is  the Palestine issue. While it is conceivable that an unjust  peace settlement  Bantustanization  might be forced upon  an inept Palestinian leadership by Israel and the US, it  cannot in the longer run last. No quasi-colonial settlement  will, against what is the last anti-colonial struggle of  modern times. But if an interim solution, along with other  developments, provides the US with a decade or more to pursue  its hegemonic ambitions, Washington will happily settle  for it.

		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 THIS ONE IS FOR THE ISLAMIC PEOPLES
 															- Document From the lecture given by Shirin Ebadi,  winner of the Nobel Peace Prize 2003, on receiving the award  at Oslo, December 10				 	 Together we fight																								The people of Iran... have shown that they deem participation in public affairs to be their right, and that they want to be masters of their own destiny. This conflict is observed not only in Iran, but also in many Muslim states. Some Muslims, under the pretext that democracy and human rights are not compatible with Islamic teachings and the traditional structure of Islamic societies, have justified despotic governments...it is not so easy to rule over a people who are aware of their rights, using traditional, patriarchal and paternalistic methods. Islam is a religion whose first sermon to the Prophet begins with the word Recite! The Quran swears by the pen and what it writes. Such a sermon and message cannot be in conflict with awareness, knowledge, wisdom, freedom of opinion and expression and cultural pluralism. 																								The discriminatory plight of women in Islamic states, too...has its roots in the patriarchal and male-dominated culture prevailing in these societies, not in Islam. This culture does not tolerate freedom and democracy, just as it does not believe in the equal rights of men and women, and the liberation of women from male domination...because it would threaten the historical and traditional position of the rulers and guardians of that culture.																								One has to say to those who have mooted the idea of a clash of civilizations, or prescribed war and military intervention for this region, and resorted to social, cultural, economic and political sluggishness of the South to justify their actions, that if you consider international human rights laws, including the nations right to determine their own destinies, to be universal, and if you believe in the priority and superiority of parliamentary democracy over other political systems, then you cannot think only of your own security and comfort, selfishly and contemptuously. A quest for new means and ideas to enable the countries of the South to enjoy human rights and democracy, while maintaining their political independence and territorial integrity...must be given top priority by the United Nations... 																								The decision by the Nobel Peace Committee to award the 2003 prize to me, as the first Iranian and the first woman from a Muslim country, inspires me and millions of Iranians and nationals of Islamic states with the hope that our endeavours and struggles for the realization of human rights and the establishment of democracy in our respective countries enjoy the support and solidarity of international civil society... 																								If human rights fail to be manifested in codified laws or put into effect by states, then, as rendered in the preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human beings will be left with no choice other than staging a rebellion against tyranny and oppression. A human being divested of all dignity, a human being deprived of human rights, a human being gripped by starvation, a human being beaten by famine, war and illness, a humiliated human being and a plundered human being is not in any position or state to recover the rights he or she has lost. If the 21st century wishes to free itself from the cycle of violence, acts of terror and war, and avoid repetition of the experience of the 20th century ...there is no other way except by understanding and putting into practice every human right for all mankind, irrespective of race, gender, faith, nationality or social status. In anticipation of that day. 																								With much gratitude  Shirin Ebadi CONCLUDED

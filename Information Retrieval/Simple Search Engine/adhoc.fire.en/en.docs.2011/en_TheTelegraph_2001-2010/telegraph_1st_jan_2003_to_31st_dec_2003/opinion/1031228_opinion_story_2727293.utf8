		 Sunday, December 28, 2003  Seasons greetings
 							 - Most vocal proponents of amity are the young in Pakistan This year has seen a gradual thaw in Indo-Pak relations. The new year promises an even warmer glow of friendship. Bharat Bhushan reports from across the border				 	 come together: Children crossing the border at Wagah to meet their grandparents in Amritsar in October this year. (PTI)																								It was a gesture that warmed up an otherwise bleak winter. When Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pakistans President General Pervez Musharraf committed themselves to normalising relations between the two countries, they could not have given a better gift to their people this year.																								The warm glow in the relationship  arguably the most significant development of the year  has come after several months of hostility. For the better part of 2002, the armies of the two countries were engaged in an eyeball-to-eyeball encounter. India and Pakistan had cancelled bus, train and flight services directly linking the two peoples, expelled and counter-expelled each others diplomats and reduced the size of missions to such a level that diplomats had to juggle two or three assignments to keep the high commissions functional. 																								Then came Vajpayees April 18 statement from Srinagar, extending a hand of friendship to Pakistan. Eight months on, the two countries seem to be on their way to restoring status quo ante  to the situation prevailing before the attack on the Indian Parliament on December 13, 2001. And next week, when Vajpayee meets Musharraf at the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation (SAARC), many in Pakistan hope that it will mark another move forward.																								The thaw in the relationship is progressing in spite of the ingrained mindset on both sides, says I.A. Rehman, the head of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission. India and Pakistan are in a competitive mood to outbid each other  India puts forward 12 proposals, Pakistan wants more; Pakistan proposes a cease-fire along the Line of Control, India wants it in Siachen also and Pakistan agrees. Vajpayee then talks of no visas, no passports and a single currency. These are welcome ideas even if they wont come into being immediately.																								Peace, clearly, has caught the imagination of the people. Increasing hostility between India and Pakistan had translated into practical difficulties. Getting a visa to go to Pakistan was next to impossible. Divided families could neither go across the border to celebrate births or marriages nor to mourn their dead. A return air ticket via Dubai cost upwards of Rs 40,000 and involved a 10 to 12-hour wait each way for connecting flights. This was a luxury few could afford, especially when the one-way fare on the Delhi-Lahore bus was Rs 800, and a ticket from Attari to Lahore on the Samjhauta Express cost less than Rs 100.																								Nearly two years after travel links between the countries were severed, connections are being restored. The bus service was revived in July this year. On January 1, the first direct flights will take off again. By mid-January, the Samjhauta Express will once again be flagged off.																								The most vocal proponents of the peace process are the young in Pakistan. Taimur Rahman, a 28-year old who teaches international relations and Pakistan studies at the prestigious Lahore University of Management Sciences, believes that greater interaction between the young would help break down the walls of stereotypes. When I went abroad, it was like a culture shock to me. I got to see myself from the outside. I saw how backward and parochial we were. Our rulers have deliberately kept us hermetically sealed and we have paid a heavy price for it, he says.																								Taimur stresses that he realised the strength of interaction when he visited Bombay and Delhi. When you freely meet the other, the demon in the other disappears. You begin discovering yourself in the other, he says.																								Sassui (pronounced, Shashi) Palejo, a young Pakistan Peoples Party legislator in the Sindh provincial assembly, is equally excited at the turn bilateral relations have taken. I come from the land of Shah Latif. His poetry makes no distinction between Hindus and Muslims. That still lives in our soul, she says. Our civilisation is the same. My name is Shashi, which means moon in Sanskrit. We drink the water of the same river, Sindhu (Indus). How unfortunate we are in not being able to see our common roots, our civilisational heritage which links our souls.																								The intense desire for peace, whether driven by a recognition of shared historical, cultural and religious links or the possibilities of beneficial economic co-operation, is also tempered with the realisation that the India-Pakistan relationship is fragile. Unless there are basic changes in the attitude of the two establishments, most Pakistanis believe that things can go wrong at any time.																								In fact, the see-sawing relationship has seen so many ups and downs, that quite a few are openly sceptical of the peace process. It is a periodic, seasonal variation. The weather changes but the climate remains the same. It is a flash in the pan caused by external pressure, says the cynic in Pervez Hoodbhoy, a teacher of physics at the Quaid-e-Azam University in Islamabad. I dont see a change of heart or a new strategy taking shape, he stresses.																								Some fear that the usual suspects  a reference to Pakistans fundamentalist leaders and army  may wish to create hindrances in the way of bilateral peace. But a situation could well emerge that if the present momentum continues and is not derailed by the cast of usual suspects and spoilers lurking in the wings, that willy-nilly the Pakistan military establishment may be dragged kicking and screaming into accepting this new reality, says Rashed Rahman, former editor of the Frontier Post.																								Many argue that the process is fragile because the quest for peace hasnt come from within, but has been thrust on the two governments. This thaw is happening because of external pressure,says Mohammad Ali Shah, president of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum. But we should come forward ourselves and rid our hearts of hate, he says.																								Like Shah, articulate Pakistani intellectuals see the present process of normalisation of ties as the result of a specific constellation of circumstances coming together. The putting together of an anti-terrorist alliance by the US post 9/11 led to the Americans chasing the Al Qaida and the Taliban out of Afghanistan, explains Rahman. This had profound implications for Kashmir  the militancy there found itself lumped under the catch-all rubric of terrorism.																								Just as there could be no support for the Islamabad-inspired and trained jehadis running riot in Afghanistan, the backing for cross-border infiltration and terrorist acts in support of Pakistans Kashmir cause has also dwindled. 																								Coupled with this are two other significant developments  the nuclear tests of May 1998 by both India and Pakistan and the American desire for normalisation of relations and regional peace in South Asia. The former ensured that war, conventional or otherwise, has become increasingly difficult if not impossible, Rahman says. 																								Washington had its own agenda. For the US to proceed with normal trade relations with India, peace in South Asia is necessary. India is in a position where it is being wooed by the US which sees the possibility of real economic returns by investing in India. It sees India as a purchaser of US technology, including defence technology. India itself is looking towards six to seven per cent growth as it opens up its markets. None of this would be possible unless there is stability in Indias relationship with Pakistan, Hoodbhoy stresses.																								Pakistan, he argues, is also under compulsion to negotiate peace with India, and Musharraf under pressure to fight the Al Qaida. Assassination attempts are being made against General Musharraf. He is being targeted by extremist groups and knows he cant make too many enemies, Hoodbhoy says.																								There is also a realisation that the people genuinely want peace with India. The desire for peace and normalisation in both India and Pakistan cannot be ignored. We can see it on the ground tangibly, says Rashed Rahman.																								Peace, clearly, is different things to different people. Taimur wants the governments to allow the young  and not just people above 65, as is now the rule  to walk across the border. People above 65 years of age can hardly walk, some may even need wheelchairs. What is the point of the Indian concession allowing them to walk across at Wagah? It should be the young, below the age of 25, who ought to be allowed to walk across, he argues. 																								Naveed Akhtar, a 27-year-old farmer from Layya near Multan, sees peace as cooperation in agriculture. 																								And a young woman in Lahore, who does not want to be identified, sees peace as the sharing of cultural identities. For both Indians and Pakistanis it is important to re-establish their linguistic, cultural, social and religious links. I should have a right to be with my Indian friends whenever I want, I should be able to learn all the interesting Hindi abuses, I should be able to wear a sari or a bindi or maybe even marry an Indian boy without causing any inconvenience to anyone, she says. I know that it is important to have a dream, she says.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 18, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Limits to an adventureThat old ace in the hole  (Fourth Estate, 3.99) by Annie Proulx is  another landscape novel from the author of the bestseller,The  Shipping News. The strange conflict of interests in  the vast, featureless yet intriguing Texas panhandle, set  off by a scout for hog farm sites in an area hostile to  the very idea of hog farms owned by multinational corporations,  initiates an unlikely but touching drama of affections and  loyalties which Proulx depicts with her sensitive touch.  Her novel draws on the strengths of the picaresque form,  the adventure of new places and the interaction with local  eccentricities, yet builds itself on a moral and emotional  logic that manages to question the ethics of global capitalism.																												American POwer and the new mandarins (Penguin, Rs 375) by Noam Chomsky was one of the most powerful statements against the American entanglement in Vietnam. Yet the essays in the collection, all of them written in the late Sixties, have gained a powerful relevance all over again with the USs latest assault against Iraq. This is Chomskys first political book in which his characteristic use of cold facts help, as usual, to sharpen the moral indictment of the USs policy abroad and hypocrisy at home. One hundred shades of white  (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Preethi Nair  is a well-written novel, spanning two continents, with a  third and a fourth shimmering in the background. That is  to say, it has everything absolutely right, with a staple  tale of Indian mothers and daughters, tied in by the magic  of cooking, and the attractions of a portmanteau oriental  philosophy of facing the hardest truth and letting go for  a deep inner peace none can buy. In spite of the pat formula,  by now put firmly in place among the successes of the world  of English language publishing, the story is grippingly  told, and does very well for a two-night-one-day train journey  across the breadth of India.Romain Rolland the story of  a conscience (Rupa, Rs 195) by Alex Aronson  is a precise and analytical study of Rollands intellectual  development and questing spirit, but it loses out sadly  in the form that is granted it by the publisher. The reprint,  dated this year, does not even record the date of first  publication, let alone any previous editions, if they exist.  Reprinting unusual but illuminating texts in a handy format  is an important function for any publisher, but ignoring  essential bibliographical information devalues the exercise.

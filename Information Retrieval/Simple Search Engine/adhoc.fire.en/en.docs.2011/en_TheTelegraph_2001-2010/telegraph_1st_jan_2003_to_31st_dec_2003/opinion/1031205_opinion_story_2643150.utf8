The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, December 05, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																At seventeen you are not serious New writing 12 (Picador,   8.99) edited by Diran Adebayo, Blake Morrison and  Jane Rogers is an absorbing selection of literary gobbets.  The writers are mostly from Britain (based in London or  its surrounds), but also include Ireland, South America,  Nigeria and Somalia. The editorial emphasis is on voices:  imagined voices, authentic (seemingly tape recorded) voices,  voices which come at us from unfamiliar places, voices which  shock and move. The editors also identify Seven Great Themes:  love, loss, sex, hunger, laughter, justice, a sense of place.  There are short stories, extracts from novels, non-fiction,  autobiography and some excellent poems, especially The  Wait by Alan Jenkins and Tim Liardets Madam Sasoo Goes  Bathing.  Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre  World of Natures Most Dangerous Creatures (Arrow,   4.55) by Carl Zimmer is a National Geographic-style  exploration of the world, mostly microscopic, of parasitic  life forms. It begins: In the beginning there was fever.  There was bloody urine. There were long quivering strings  of flesh that spooled out of the skin. There was a sleepy  death in the wake of biting flies. Then there are the filarial  worms, which can make the scrotum swell up until it can  fill up a wheelbarrow. It is astonishing how quickly one  can get used to this. There is philosophy at the end: Theres  no shame in being a parasite...But we are clumsy in the  parasitic way of life...If we want to succeed as parasites,  we need to learn from the masters. Waterlines: the penguin book  of river writings (Penguin, Rs 295) edited  by Amita Baviskar is a beautiful anthology compiled  by an environmental sociologist. The intimate presence of  rivers in the imaginary, spiritual and everyday lives of  Indians, over the ages, and the various forms of expression  this has been given are the subjects of this collection.  There are poems by Bhartrihari and A.K. Ramanujan, Tagores  Ghater Katha, and varied pieces by Arundhati Roy,  Jim Corbett, Mukul Sharma, Ruchir Joshi, Arvind Krishna  Mehrotra and others. Hope is a river/ Whose water is desire,/  Whose waves are craving./ Passions are crocodiles,/ Conjectures  are birds/ Destroying the tree of resolve./ Anxiety carves  a deep ravine/ And the whirlpool of delusion/ Makes it difficult  to ford./ Let ascetics who cross/ To the opposite shore/  Exult in their purified minds. (Bhartrihari, Satakatrayam,173.) Zastrozzi (Hesperus,   6.99) by Percy Bysshe Shelley is a Gothic  novel written by a schoolboy, as Germaine Greer writes  in her self-consciously outrageous foreword. Published when  Shelley was barely 18, this romance is a Sturm-und-Drang  mix of Etonian sado-masochism and Monk-Lewis-inspired  pastiche, set in dark, old Castello dei Laurentini. Greer  reads it as a treatment of a love that still dare not speak  its name, the love of a juvenile for adult women. Freshers (Jonathan  Cape,  5.80) by Kevin Sampson quotes Rimbaud  as epigraph, At seventeen you are not serious, to which  Sampsons protagonist, Kit Hannah, replies, I fucking  am. He is in first-year university, cocky, popular, but  actually frightened out of his wits to start life away from  home. His gang includes a posh psychologist, a pathological  liar, a fitness fanatic, an American exchange student and  sundry other endearingly maladjusted young persons. Petra  wants Kit, but Kit wants her to just be his friend. Kit  likes Colette, but cant quite make a definite move. Which  young person who works hard, drinks, takes drugs, stays  out late, eats a bad diet and doesnt get their full quota  of sleep does not display symptoms of listlessness, low  motivation, anxiety and so on?

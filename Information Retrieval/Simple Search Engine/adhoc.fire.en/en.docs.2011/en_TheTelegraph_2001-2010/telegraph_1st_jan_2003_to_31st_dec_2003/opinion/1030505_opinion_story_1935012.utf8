		 Monday, May 05, 2003  GRAPPLING WITH A NEW AND CHANGING WORLD
 While strengthening Muslims sense  of belonging to one community, globalization has also awakened  the sense that Islam is heterogeneous, argues Riyaz Hassan  The author is professor of sociology  at the Flinders University of South Australia and currently  a visiting Professor in the Department of Sociology, Yale  University. He is the author of Faithlines: Muslim Conceptions  of Islam and Society Muslim  women praying in Indonesia  In the aftermath of the terrorist  attacks of September 11, the effect of globalization on  Islam has emerged as a hotly debated topic. With 20 per  cent of the worlds population professing Islam as their  religion, it is a matter of more than academic interest.  A survey of the evolution of Islam in recent decades shows  that ummah  a universal community based on shared  Islamic faith and implementation of its law  has indeed  become a greater reality in an ever-shrinking world. At  the same time, globalization has also allowed divisive militancy  to arise and flourish. In the years to come, the force of  globalization may lead to the emergence of multiple centres  of Islam rather than the current one based in Saudi Arabia.  Islamic historians have credited the concept of ummah as  an important contributing factor in the rise and development  of Islam and Islamic civilization. The evidence from various  studies shows that although Muslims share a sense of being  part of a global ummah, the intensity of this feeling varies  significantly across Muslim countries. This variation can be attributed  to the broader reality of the Muslim world. Unlike in the  past, when limitations of transport and communication technologies  made it difficult for Muslims worldwide to acknowledge the  cultural and social diversity of the ummah, the introduction  of satellite television, internet, international travel,  and access to books and magazines and increasing literacy  are now making Muslims aware of their cultural and social  diversity. The impact of colonialism and the emergence of  nationalist movements, which spearheaded the struggle against  it, have also served to fragment the Islamic world into  over 45 Muslim countries with competing economic and political  interests. Another consequence of this development for Muslims  is that while they are becoming aware of the cultural diversity  of the Muslim world, the new technologies are also promoting  a greater ummah consciousness, a heightened sense of belonging  to a global community of believers. In the pre-globalized world, ummah  consciousness was largely determined by the practice of  the five pillars of Islam (belief in Allah, payment of  zakat (welfare tax for the poor), performance of  haj, daily prayers and fasting) and certain other  key beliefs. The existence of these Islamic beliefs and  practices was seen by many believers everywhere as evidence  that the entire culture of the Muslim societies was Islamized,  that is, had come to resemble the Arabian Islamic culture  where Islam had originated. This transformation of all Islamized  people was considered to be an integral part of Mohammads  social and religious mission. It was rather navely assumed  by many Islamic intellectuals in the Middle East that such  a cultural trajectory was the common destiny of all Islamized  people. The difficulties of communication and contact with  people in far-off regions fed this belief. Globalization is prompting a reformulation  of the common Muslim belief that Islam is not only a religion  but also a complete way of life. Instantaneous and worldwide  communication links are now allowing Muslims and non-Muslims  to experience the reality of different Islamic cultures.  Such experiences reveal not only what is common among Muslims  but also what is different. For example, gender relations  and dress codes for Muslim women are structured in different  ways in Muslim countries like Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey  and Uzbekistan. Similarly, there are vast differences  in the religious practices of Abangan or syncretic Javanese  Muslims and Wahabi Muslims (followers of the strict practice  insisted by Mohammad ibn Abd al-Wahab) of Saudi Arabia and  Pakistan. This realization has provoked an unfavourable  reaction among some groups of Islamic intellectuals towards  this hybridity (syncretic and heterogenous Islam). It  has caused some radical Islamic movements to seek to replace  hybridity with the authentic Islamic way of life. In  Indonesia, the largest Muslim country, Islamic scholars  like Azyumardi Azra have rejected the ideologies of radical  Islamic organizations like Front Pembela Islam, Jamaat Muslimen  Indonesia and al Qaida because they see these organizations  as advocating Arabic Islam (authentic Islam) and rejecting  the accommodative Indonesian Islam (hybrid Islam). The struggle between hybridity  and authenticity represents perhaps the most important  challenge of globalization for the Muslim ummah. It is one  of the underlying causes of the emergence of Islamic fundamentalist  movements. Fundamentalism refers to a strategy used by followers  of Islamic purists like Maududi, Syed Qutb and Ayatuallah  Khomenei to assert their own construction of religious identity  and Islamic social order as the exclusive basis for a re-created  political and social order. They feel that Islamic religious  identity is at risk and is being eroded by cultural and  religious hybridity. They try to fortify their interpretations  of religious ways of being through their selective retrieval  and particular reading of Islamic doctrines and practices  from a sacred past. Modernity in its political and  social forms refers to increasing specialization of societal  institutions like political systems, law, economic management,  and education in isolation from religion. Unlike social  life in the pre-modern era, in modernity these functions  are carried out free from the overarching influence of religion.  From this perspective, religious fundamentalism  in the  sense of a return to a purist past  is a problem produced  by the encounter between modernity and the Muslim ummah  in all its diversity and cultural hybridity. Although the  strength of fundamentalism varies according to the intensity  of attitudes towards these features, it is clear that in  a globalizing world, diversity and cultural crossovers will  become a matter of routine. Instead of eliminating hybridity,  this may in fact transform different Islamic countries and  regions into autonomous cultural systems, thus posing a  challenge to the conventional categorical oppositions of  us and them, Muslim and others. This would have far-reaching implications  for the Muslim ummah. Islamic countries could be transformed  into unique religious and cultural systems, each claiming  acceptance and recognition as authentic traditions of Islam.  This transformation may lead to the decentring of the  Muslim world from its supposed cultural and religious centre  in the Arabic Middle East to a multi-centred world. Five  such centres of the Islamic world can already be identified,  namely, Arabic Middle Eastern Islam, African Islam, central  Asian Islam, southeast Asian Islam and the Islam of the  Muslim minorities in the West. A decentred Muslim ummah would  confer a kind of legitimacy on the regional ummahs, and  thus could lead them to chart their own social, political,  economic, religious and cultural developments along distinctive  lines suitable to the history and temperament of their people.  This would engender new opportunities for the Muslim ummahs  to again strive for the intellectual, cultural and material  superiority that was achieved by the ummah in its formative  centuries under the institution of the Islamic Caliphate.  In such a scenario, the Islamic ummah would gain strength  not as a unified and unitary community but as a differentiated  community consisting of the regional ummahs, all striving  to gain material and ideological influences in a global  system. These developments would also produce their own  opposing and supporting movements requiring each ummah to  find appropriate responses to them. In a culturally and religiously  ummah setting, it is possible that political and cultural  leanings of one or some of the regional ummahs may not find  approval with the governors of the holy centres of Mecca  and Medina. This may pose difficulties for the members of  these regional ummahs regarding free access to these centres  to perform their religious duties. This in turn may necessitate  the formulation of new and appropriate governing structures  for these holy centres of Islam. Muslims from different parts of  the Islamic world are becoming interested in reforms to  the management and governance of the holy centres by the  government of Saudi Arabia. There is growing dissatisfaction  with the current idiosyncratic policies of the Saudi government,  such as barring adult single women unaccompanied by a male  member of the immediate family and banning non-Muslims from  visiting the holy places like Mecca and Medina are seen  as inappropriate, anachronistic and unsuitable to the conditions  of modern times. While these and similar issues which are  likely to arise may initially pose difficulties, they may  also be the harbingers of the new futures which await a  differentiated Muslim ummah in the modernized and globalized  world of the 21st century.

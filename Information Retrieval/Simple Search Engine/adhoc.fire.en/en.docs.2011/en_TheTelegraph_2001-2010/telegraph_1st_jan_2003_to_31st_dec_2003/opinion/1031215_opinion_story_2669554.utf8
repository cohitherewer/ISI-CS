The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, December 15, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Aiming high, naturally				 																																																				Sir  There is no reason Najma Heptullah should have stunned Congressmen with her snub at the Rajya Sabha (Walkout boot on the other foot, Dec 13). Heptullah has made no bones about her ambitions, some of which the Congress itself stoked to promote its own interests. It once did the party a lot of good to have a Congress deputy speaker of the Rajya Sabha and to promote a female minority community Congress worker as the leader of several foreign delegations. If the lady is now walking her own way, and courting the saffron parivar, it is because an undecided Congress is not too sure of what use Heptullah can be put to, especially now that secularism is no longer a virtue with the party. The Congress must be having the same trepidations as Dr Frankenstein once had about his monster. But one probably needs to remind the party, as one current advertisement would have us believe, that it is, after all, only natural for humans to want more.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, J.B. Chatterjee, Calcutta
				 																Serving without love				 																																																				Sir  Politicians consider bureaucrats to be their own servants. It is unfortunate that despite their education and experience, most officers in the administrative and police services are made to pay obeisance to their political masters. D.P. Ojha, former director general of the Bihar police, has brought a very serious charge against an Rashtriya Janata Dal member of parliament, Shahabuddin, and this allegation should have been given its due weight. Unfortunately, Laloo Prasad Yadav has decided to take an easy way out by sacking the police officer. This is not expected from a national leader like him. The alacrity with which the government has proceeded against him shows that the downslide in Bihar is almost complete. Sonia Gandhi should distance her party from the RJD. For now, the Bihar government, for its own sake, should provide Ojha adequate security. There are chances that some anti-nationalist forces may try to harm Ojha and wreak havoc in Bihar.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Successive incidents  the murder of Satyendra Dubey, Praveen Kumar, the sacking of D.P. Ojha  all attest to the fact that only characters like Yadav himself, or congenital buffoons like his legislators can survive in his state. My heart goes out to the people who live in Bihar. It is a matter of shame that they are tolerating such monsters. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ramen Saikia, Jorhat

				 																Remains of the day				 																																																				Sir  Madhushree C. Bhowmik approached A.K. Singh, head of the Anthropological Survey of India office, for our reaction. We had reserved our comments till we had some good photographs of the site. She promised to come back with them. Instead, she hurriedly reported Global interest in stone-age site (Sept 11), stating that the Anthropological Survey of India team would explore the possibility of finding fossils. Later another journalist visited us from a different paper with photographs which clearly showed that in the absence of the lower quaternary stratigraphy, the possibility of finding human fossils was inadmissible. The parallelism on the basis of the Gondwana group of India and Africa is no consideration in the context of human evolution in the quaternary period. The parallelism of antiquity between India and Africa is also uncalled for given no evidence of Paranthropus, Australopithecus and Homo habilis hominids as well as of the Olduwan cultural state in Indian prehistory. Without absolute date or bio-stratigraphic evidence, there is no point calling the Jamshola palaeoliths, the oldest in the world. Also, mere co-occurrences of stone artifacts of different cultures on the surface of the non-fluvial terraces, would not justify continuity. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
A.R. Sankhyan, Anthropological Survey of India, Calcutta

				 																																																				Madhushree C. Bhowmik replies: 				 																																																				It is surprising that it took the Anthropological Survey of India so long to react to the find on the basis of some photographs taken by a layman. How is the institution so definite that the photos are actually of the site, especially since the explorer has no knowledge of accompanying any other scribe, other than me, to the site. As experts, the institution should not have jumped to conclusions on the basis of some photographs.				 																																																				Moreover, my story did not speak of the evidence of human fossils. It formed a general outline of the pre-history of the area based on the cultural evidence like tools used by early man. The site, incidentally, houses cultural material from the second fluvial (also spelt as phluvial) age at different stratigraphical levels. The earliest form of human tools have been found in the consolidated boulder conglomerate, which is universally dated (in Indian context) to the second fluvial age (second glacial age). If it is a fluvial area, there is little possibility of getting other deposits. The claim that there are no fluvial deposits is contrary to the morphology and topography of the area. The stratigraphy and the terraces bear evidence of flood-related activity.				 																																																				The parallelism drawn is on the basis of tools, typology and technical considerations. We spoke of identical technological manifestations found in the east African sites  in other words similarity in types. In India, we find evidence of early humans in the Siwaliks. Plenty of fossils of different myocene and pliocene primates have been found in the country. So it is not advisable to ignore the presence of material related to the Australopithecus in India. The only fossil evidence of Homo erectus was discovered in the Narmada valley and the credit for that goes to a geologist. The explorer concerned has found plenty of evidence of Olduwan unifacial tools from the site. The anthropologists should first visit the site and form their own opinions.

 - Democracy is not working to protect the interests of the  majority  Abhirup Sarkar The author is professor of economics,  Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta The recently concluded World Trade  Organization meetings at Cancun offer a couple of puzzles.  They also raise a deeper question about democracy and free  markets. First the puzzles. The Cancun round of talks broke  down because of the inflexible stance taken by the advanced  countries, namely, the United States of America, the European  Union and Japan, with respect to agricultural subsidies.  These countries did not yield an inch when it came to the  question of reducing their domestic subsidies on agricultural  and farm products. Obviously they were protecting someones  interest. Whose interest were they protecting? Whose interests  are hurt by the subsidies? The greatest beneficiaries of  the subsidies are, of course, the Western and Japanese farmers.  On the other hand, farmers in the third world, who could  have penetrated the Western and Japanese markets in the  absence of subsidies, stand to lose. But they are not the  worst losers. Their loss, which is because of unrealized  gains from trade, is only potential. The real burden is  borne by the millions of taxpayers in the advanced countries  who are actually footing the subsidy bill. In the advanced  countries, about 2 to 4 per cent of the labour force earns  its livelihood from agriculture and farm-related activities.  So the agricultural subsidy policy is basically protecting  the interest of a handful of farmers at the cost of millions  of common taxpayers. Why would a government, which cares  about future elections, want to do that? This is the first  puzzle. The puzzle is not hard to resolve  though. Agricultural subsidies are financed by hidden taxes.  The burden of the subsidy, which is to the tune of billions  of dollars, is distributed over millions of taxpayers. So  an individual taxpayer does not find the sting unbearable.  Moreover, taxes are collected for a variety of reasons and  subsidizing agriculture is just one of them. Of course,  an individual taxpayer hates to pay taxes. But he has no  way to find out exactly how much he is paying to subsidize  agriculture in particular. For these reasons, taxpayers  are not visibly opposed to agricultural subsidy policies.  On the other hand, the beneficiaries  of the subsidy are small in number and so each of them gets  a sizeable chunk of the cake. Therefore, each is extremely  sensitive to the subsidy policy. More important, being small  in number, the beneficiaries can easily form a group and  effectively lobby with the government. The set of taxpayers,  on the contrary, is too large and disparate to form a potent  interest group. There is, however, yet another  puzzle. In the advanced countries, while agriculture is  heavily protected through subsidies, industry is relatively  open to foreign competition. As a result, although less  developed countries had little success in penetrating agricultural  markets in the West, they have made quite a dent in the  markets for industrial goods over the last few decades.  To this one may add the more recent phenomenon of outsourcing.  Outsourcing, which is the dominant form of trade in services  at present, has immensely benefited the less developed countries,  especially India. Relative openness of the manufacturing  and the services sectors in the West has indeed inflicted  significant costs on certain sections of the Western society.  Over the last few years, in the US alone, nearly three million  jobs have been lost because of foreign competition. If outsourcing  grows at its present pace, according to most estimates,  several million more jobs would be lost in the immediate  future. These are not hidden costs. So public opinion is  building up fast against outsourcing and foreign competition.  But in spite of all oppositions,  no serious attempt has been made so far to restrict imports  of manufactures and services from the less developed countries.  Here is the second puzzle. While the governments in the  West are so keen to protect the interest of the farmers  who do not account for more than 4 per cent of the labour  force, they seem to be reluctant to safeguard the welfare  of the remaining 96 per cent. What is so special about agriculture? Indeed, protection of agriculture  in the West has a very long history. British farmers were  protected from outside competition in as early as the 12th  century by the well-known Corn Laws. This arrangement of  prohibiting foodgrain imports from abroad continued for  a long time and then in 18th and 19th century England, the  issue of protectionism assumed a fresh political importance.  There was basically a clash of interest between the newly  emerging capitalists and the traditional landlords. The  former favoured cheap imports of foodgrains from the colonies  to keep wages down. The latter obviously resisted it, for  cheap imports meant a significant reduction in their income.  The strife ended in a repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. This  is sometimes viewed as a triumph of dynamic capitalists  over defunct feudal lords. In 1932, however, the law was  reintroduced, though in a milder form. One may argue that the reason  why protective umbrellas for agriculture have not been withdrawn  for long is food security. It is certainly economical to  import cheap foodgrains from abroad as long as supplies  are stable and smooth. But foreign supplies are often uncertain,  especially those from the less developed countries. For  one thing, agricultural production in poorer countries is  still dependent on the whims of nature and so supply is  typically fluctuating. For another, dependence on a foreign  country for something as basic as food puts the importing  country in a vulnerable position. The problem of dependence was  not there during the colonial period, for the control of  a colony, along with that of its food supply, lay completely  in the hands of the imperial power. But not so any more.  So, to guarantee food security, it is necessary to continue  production at home, even if it is costly to do so. Perhaps  there is a grain of truth in the food security argument,  but it can hardly be a complete explanation of the coexistence  of agricultural protectionism along with industrial openness  in the advanced countries. Where do we draw the line between  basics and non-basics? Basic existence in advanced industrialized  countries requires so many commodities other than food.  If free trade can be allowed in these commodities, why not  in food? A better explanation is provided by a political  economy argument of lobbying.  We have already explained how  farmers in the West, being small in number, can lobby very  successfully with the government. Small and powerful groups  of industrialists are also capable of doing that. Indeed,  outsourcing is in the interest of these industrialists.  It reduces costs and increases profits. In recent years,  there has been a spectacular increase in the profitability  of the US firms and this is mainly due to outsourcing. True,  outsourcing reduces domestic employment, but then who cares  about the workers? Again, import of certain manufacturing  items does not hurt the interest of the big industrialists  because they have already shifted their capital away from  these sectors to more technology-intensive ones. One important thing needs to be  explained though. If unemployment is rising and the workers  are becoming more and more unhappy, how can the ruling party  hope to win the next election? In fact, the chances of winning  an election not only depends on the sentiment of the masses,  it crucially depends on the funds to run elections. The  funds, in turn, are provided by the different lobbying groups.  Funds become more and more important in running elections  as smaller fractions of the population actually turn up  to vote. This is indeed the case in many advanced countries.  So, it is not surprising at all that policies are adopted  to satisfy small interest groups mainly. It appears that  democracy is not working to protect the interest of the  majority. Neither is it supporting open markets, free trade  and the welfare of the people.

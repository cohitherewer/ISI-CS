		 Saturday, July 12, 2003  LIVING PHILOSOPHY
 - Bernard Williams, 1929-2003  Obituary / Pratap Bhanu Mehta The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University The examined life  Bernard Williams, who pass- ed  away on June 10, 2003, was arguably the greatest post-war  British philosopher. While Williamss commanding intellect,  penetrating arguments and thoroughly original conception  of the subject would have secured him a place in any pantheon  of important philosophers, his pre-eminence is itself a  measure of his transformative impact on philosophy. He is  known mostly as a moral philosopher, although his impact  on the philosophy of mind and on cultural criticism was  immense.  In some ways, his pre-eminence  is surprising. He was always a lucid writer, but is never  easy to read; the intensity and complexity of his thought  always remain something of a challenge. He is not identified  with any system, did not found any new school, and unlike  many of his contemporaries, his legacy is not easy to characterize.  While J.L. Austin is still the stuff of common-room legend,  he wrote little, and his impact has largely been on the  philosophy of language. A.J. Ayer wrote a good deal and  very stylishly, but in the end, his positivist allegiances  were too arid to incite much excitement.  Peter Strawson and Michael Dummett  dominated Oxford since the Sixties, valiantly trying to  disprove the opinion that most contemporary philosophy,  at least at Oxford, was a series of extended commentaries  on Wittgenstein. Both had a wide-ranging impact: Strawson  in metaphysics and Dummett in the philosophy of language  and philosophical logic, but neither gave philosophy many  resources to address the greatest challenges it was to face  as a discipline. Bernard Williamss great impact  stems from the fact that he was squarely in the middle of  this challenge. This challenge can best be described as  the assault of historicism on philosophy. This is the view  that concepts are historically embedded, and one cannot  say much meaningfully about them unless one locates them  in a particular conceptual history. One cannot therefore  answer questions such as What is truth? and What is meaning?  in the abstract, as philosophers are often prone to do.  In ethics, Williams argued that our ethical ideas are a  complex deposit of many different traditions and social  forces, and they have themselves been shaped by self-conscious  representations of that history. What history will reveal  is always the contingency of any concept, and any philosophy  that does not engage with this contingency, and comforts  itself by claiming the authority of necessary truths is  liable to self-delusion. In making this argument, Williams  was indebted above all to Nietzsche. And his greatest achievement  lies in the fact that he was the sole British philosopher  to take Nietzsches exposure of philosophy seriously and  confront it. His last book, Truth and Truthfulness,  does magnificently for the concept of truth what Nietzsche  had done for morality: show its contingent origins and functions.  But unlike the flippant Nietzscheanism of a Derrida or a  Rorty, which ultimately ends in a kind of anything goes  position, Williamss genius was to argue that revealing  the contingent nature of these concepts strengthened their  hold upon us rather than weakening it. His book was a powerful  assault on those who propounded the fashionable belief that  truth has no value, as it was an attack on those who thought  that the traditional faith in truth guarantees itself. Williamss second great achievement  was to take moral philosophy seriously. Almost having been  banished from philosophy departments, moral philosophy has  come back with a vengeance, and its rehabilitation has something  to do with both the revival of Kantianism under John Rawls  in America, and the critique of that revival provided by  Williams. Williams was a life-long critic of system-building  and arid conceptual analysis. He began his book, Morality,  by chastising his colleagues for refusing to write anything  of importance or making it impossible to take them seriously.  No one ever levelled this charge against Williams. Indeed,  his distinctiveness stems from the fact that he philosophizes  with an enormous sense of life, raising difficult questions,  resisting cheap answers and using the most vivid examples.  His essay, Moral Luck,  is a critique of a priori rule-based moralities such  as Kants. It argues that our sense of what is justified  often depends on how our life, as a whole, turns out and  is not immune to luck. The fact that Gauguin turned out  to be great painter might put the act of his leaving his  family in a different light than if he had been a failure.  In Utilitarianism, he argued that utilitarianism  consistently underestimates the importance of integrity.  In his most systematic work on ethics, Ethics and the  Limits of Philosophy, he argued that ethical knowledge  was a form of knowledge, but could not be thought of as  analogous with science. Indeed, assimilating knowledge to  a scientific paradigm weakens the authority of moral concepts.  He once accused a philosopher of having one thought too  many, the point being that philosophy has to be answerable  to the complexities of life rather than the other way round.  He is a penetrating moral psychologist, an essential quality  for a great moral philosopher. He wrote extensively on the nature  of reasoning, on personal identity, on the character of  consciousness, power, rights, equality, bioethics, and on  assorted topics such as Descartes, Greek ethics, music and  even a classic essay on the tedium of immortality. My personal  favourite is Shame and Necessity, an account of Greek  ethics which reveals much about our own.  Watching him over innumerable  talks and conferences, I can say this with confidence: with  the possible exception of Alasdair McIntyre, I dont think  I have encountered anyone who was as impossible to win an  argument against as Williams used to be. He was always penetratingly  clear and would illuminate, like a search-light, the core  issue, while his interlocutors were still groping in the  dark. He was never pretentious, always probing and often  witty and sardonic. He believed that the best way of respecting  your colleagues and students was to expose their folly,  and he had the extraordinary capacity to say something original  about a subject that you thought had been talked to death.  Williams was a public intellectual  in the best sense of the term. Born in 1929, he served in  the royal air force, was appointed to a fellowship at All  Souls at the age of 22, then moved, first to London, then  to Cambridge, where he was Knightsbridge Professor of Philosophy.  He went on to become provost of Kings College, Cambridge,  before moving to Berkeley. He returned to Oxford as Whites  Professor of Moral Philosophy. The Williams committee report  on obscenity and censorship was his handiwork, and is a  tour de force of clear reasoning on a difficult public  policy issue. He was previously married to the labour politician,  Shirley Williams, and is now survived by his wife, Patricia  Skinner, and three children; he was knighted in 1999. He once said that there was no  point being a philosopher unless you were very good. In  other disciplines, someone with modest gifts could at least  produce something others could build on. But what would  a less than excellent philosopher do? This concern reflected  his absolutely fierce intellectual standards, and he unfailingly  lived up to them. Like Nietzsche, his great hero, he philosophized  with a hammer, puncturing great pretension and relentlessly  exposing illusions. And, like Nietzsche, he never let philosophy  rest in the aridities of conceptual analysis, the false  simplicities of neat systems and most important, never let  it run away from the complexity of life. For those who reduce  philosophy simply to technical prowess, there will always  be other heroes. For those who think of philosophy as an  aid to the examined life, in the best sense of the term,  Williams will always remain an inspiration.

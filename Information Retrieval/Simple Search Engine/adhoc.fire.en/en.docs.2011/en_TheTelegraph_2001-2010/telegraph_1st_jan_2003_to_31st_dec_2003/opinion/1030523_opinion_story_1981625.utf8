 - Are policymakers aware of what the post-1970 generation  wants?  BIBEK DEBROY The author is director, Rajiv Gandhi  Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi India has 200 million households.  Sixty million are below the poverty line. Of these 60 million  households, 15 million are described as poorest of the poor  by the government. For these 60 million households, nothing  has changed in the last two hundred years, if not more.  This is Bharat, as opposed to India. Above this 60 million  is another category of perhaps another 80 million households.  Nothing has significantly changed for them either, although  this is the segment that will witness the fastest change  in the next 10 years. That leaves the remaining 60 million  Indian households, the India component. This is primarily,  but not exclusively, located in urban areas. More importantly,  the 60 million India component has access to English. The  remaining 140 million only has access to vernacular languages.  Thats a crucial distinction. Urban lifestyles have traditionally  meant the six metros  Chennai, Calcutta, Hyderbad, Mumbai,  Bangalore and Delhi. One of the messages of the Nineties  is that this identification has broken down. Driven partly  by high costs of real estate in the metros, growth has spilled  over to around 50 cities. Prosperity is evident in these  non-metro cities as well.  There is a clear generation divide  in this urban population of 60 million. For simplicity,  lets divide them into three groups  those who were born  before 1947, those who were born between 1947 and 1970 and  those who were born after 1970. The non-resident Indian  community is a different proposition altogether. The group born before 1947 has  either retired or is close to retirement. Born in colonial  India, this group is much less confident about liberalization.  Economic globalization tends to be identified with imperialism.  Unfortunately, policy in India is usually made by those  who are more than 65 years of age. Independence and consequent  partition of India was possibly the most traumatic event  this generation has been through. Consequently, the Kashmir  problem will be impossible to solve as long as this group  makes policy.  Economically, this generation  faces considerable pressures. Historically, the government  guaranteed nominal rates of return that were over 12 per  cent on government borrowings. To match these government  guaranteed returns, banks had to offer high returns on fixed  deposits. Reforms, competition and lower rates of inflation  have now led to nominal rates of return of around 6 per  cent. Liberalization has also led to lower rates of return  on gold and real estate, traditional savings avenues. Stock  markets are not attractive because of higher risk and corporate  mis-governance. This uncertainty is spliced with breakdowns  in joint families and accompanying old-age care. Simultaneously,  life expectancy has increased. The group born between 1947 and  1970 identified with the non-aligned movement and the Cold  War. Quite often, it was a generation educated in Britain  rather than the United States of America. It identified  with Vietnam-type protests and almost tautologically, is  against the US government, though not necessarily anti-American.  Leftist, though not necessarily communist, leanings are  strong in this group. It is also a generation that identifies  strongly with the public sector, developed in the Fifties  and the Sixties. The government employs 20 million people,  6 million in the public sector. This is nothing compared  to the total labour force of 400 million. However, this  6 million usually works in urban areas and there are 60  million urban households. Therefore, roughly one out of  every three urban households makes its living from the government.  This is a political economy point  that is often missed. This segment is the group threatened  most by liberalization. Some downsizing and voluntary retirement  schemes have happened in the government and in the private  sector. This group identified with the idea of working for  one particular organization until one retired at the age  of 60 or 65. Employment security was therefore synonymous  with job security in the same organization. Losing ones  job in the mid-40s was a devastating experience. Having  not upgraded ones skills, someone thus fired finds it impossible  to be re-employed.  There is also a geographical element  to this. Most sick public sector units are in eastern India  and it is there that employment growth has been the least  in the Nineties. This generation was also the main support  base for trade union membership in India. Trade union membership,  identified with conventional manufacturing, has not just  plateaued out, it is actually shrinking. In any case, trade  unions are pertinent for the organized labour market and  most recent job growth has been in the unorganized sector. This leaves the group born after  1970, representing the most interesting transition that  is taking place in urban India.  First, this generation grew up  or entered the labour force in the Nineties. The Eighties  were when the print media exploded, the Nineties brought  an explosion in satellite television and later, the internet.  Liberalization brought an exposure to global brands. Second,  quite often, this generation was educated in the US rather  than Britain. This makes it intrinsically closer to the  US and not just in terms of blue jeans or McDonalds, although  it is true that CNN rather than BBC is the most likely channel  to be watched.  Third, this is a post-Cold War  generation, identifying not with the non-aligned movement  but with economic prosperity. The preamble to the Indian  Constitution proclaims that India is a socialist republic.  But this generation no longer identifies with socialism.  Issues like Kashmir are historical baggage. Lets settle  with the line of control as an international boundary and  get on with life. Thats the kind of argument. Fourth, pre-1991,  industrial policy and licensing tried to ensure balanced  regional development. The model therefore was one of taking  jobs to people. Reforms ended licensing and the model switched  to one of taking people to jobs.  Hence, there has been a remarkable  increase in inter-state cum inter-regional migration. Such  migration has tended to diminish sub-national identities.  For example, earlier generations were likely to describe  themselves as Bengalis or Punjabis or Gujaratis. This generation  is much more likely to describe itself as Indian. Inter-regional  marriages have also become much more common. Fifth, this  generation is nationalistic in a different kind of way.  National identities have a correlation with language. India  doesnt have a single national language. Earlier attempts  to coercively push Hindi down the throat of every Indian  didnt succeed. Now, thanks to Bollywood films, Hindi is  spoken by every Indian. This may have reinforced this national  identity, and this generation may not make a fetish out  of Independence Day on August 15 or Republic Day on January  26, but readily identifies with nationalist sentiments through  nuclear tests, religious manifestations or even lunar missions.  This generation is also extremely  comfortable with English as a language. So was the earlier  generation, that born between 1947 and 1970. But for that  earlier generation, English was a foreign language. For  this generation, English is an Indian language and there  is thus an increasing propensity to mix English freely with  Hindi. Sixth, this generation has higher  spending propensities, as opposed to savings. Witness the  explosion in credit cards. The earlier generation used credit  cards as debit cards or charge cards. It is the generation  born after 1970 that uses credit cards as credit cards.  Seventh, this generation is much more confident and therefore,  much more amenable to the prospect of handling job uncertainty.  Policy is made by those who were  born before 1947. But do they understand what those born  after 1970 want? It is the generation born after 1970 that  will bear the consequences of the policy thus formulated.

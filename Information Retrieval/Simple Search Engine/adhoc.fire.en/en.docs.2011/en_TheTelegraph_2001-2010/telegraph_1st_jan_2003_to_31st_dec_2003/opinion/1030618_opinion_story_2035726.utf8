 - The dangerous consequences of planting reporters with troops  Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting The military forces, led by the  United States of America, attacking Iraq cannot really claim  too many acts which have won universal admiration and applause.  Their precision-bombing killed and maimed a number of women  and children; they used cluster bombs, we now learn, which  violated their own rules of engagement; they destroyed the  civic structures of a number of cities and towns, thus denying  water (in the heat of summer) and electricity, law and order,  the removal of garbage and other routine civic functions  to thousands of ordinary people whose only crime was not  that they were members of al Qaida or supporters of Saddam  Hussain, and not that they were members of Saddams army,  but that they were Iraqis.  They did, indeed, pull down a  statue of Saddam. This was broadcast live round the world,  and must have had the rednecks in the US cheering wildly.  To them that must have been a major triumph, one which will  no doubt get many US soldiers the Purple Heart or whatever  medals they give to their bravest. They actually pulled  down a statue, using a tank. In one of the Bond films (Goldeneye,  I think), Pierce Brosnan uses a tank  a Russian tank,  true, but a tank nonetheless  to smash through a statue  of a Pegasus-like creature which then rides through the  streets of St. Petersburg on top of the tank till an inconveniently  placed building knocks it down. Tanks are very useful to  pull down statues, as Pierce Brosnan on his own, and the  intrepid American armoured unit which pulled down Saddams  statue, have shown the world. They also did a Hollywood-style  rescue of a young, blonde and pretty US private, Jessica  Lynch, but unfortunately that was exposed as a publicity  stunt enacted for the benefit of the wildly cheering rednecks  in America, and their counterparts in Britain. Not only  was the rescue staged for the cameras, they actually came  close to killing her off when the well-meaning Iraqi doctor  in the hospital sent her in an ambulance, obviously clearly  marked as one, to a US check point. The American troops  opened fire on it  no question asked, no warning to go  back, nothing. But that was understandable; the soldiers  were very frightened of suicide bombers; one or two of them  might actually have been killed by an evil suicide bomber,  so opening fire on the ambulance was all right.  The ambulance hastily returned,  and amazingly, the American troops, who must have used very  sophisticated weapons which shoot zillions of rounds a second,  couldnt even hit it! Very very frightened, the soldiers  must have been. But there was one thing they did which deserves  admiration and praise. This was the embedding of journalists.  Selected journalists were made part of military units, dressed  in uniform, and they actually were present during whatever  action the military took. This had never been done before,  and, from the point of view of military PR, it was a brilliant  thing to have done. There were the usual briefings, of course,  but what could match the pictures and reports from journalists  who were seeing it right as it happened?  Just consider the following. First,  they could select which journalist they wanted where. (Maybe  they didnt actually select them, but it would be silly  to think they wouldnt, say, discuss possible choices, with  editors and news managers.) Second, the embedded journalist  would be so caught up in reporting the actual details that  he wouldnt really have the time or opportunity to comment,  leave alone comment critically. In any case, critical comment  was out; how could you possibly be critical of soldiers  you were staying with, eating with and chatting with? Which,  of course, the spin specialists in the Pentagon would have  known from the start. Third, and this was the really clever  bit, even the editors and television analysts whose journalists  were embedded couldnt be critical or anything but supportive   after all, their people were there, with the troops. Hostages,  if you like. Was it surprising, then, that  everyone, even the Americans, began watching the BBC for  what they considered the real news? Was it surprising that  the BBC correspondent, Rageh Omaar, became a symbol of unbiased,  on-the-spot reporting from Baghdad, not embedded with a  convenient army unit? Of course, once there was a general  realization of how widely his reports were being watched,  there were some clumsy attempts to trash him with planted  stories of how he tried to curry favour with the Iraqi authorities   attempts that stopped abruptly when those responsible  for them realized that they were having no effect. A BBC producer who was also working  independently without becoming the kind of icon Rageh Omaar  did is Stuart Hughes. He had to have his foot amputated  after being in a landmine blast. Hughes says, News organizations  have realized how successful embedding has been  its a  particularly good way for getting footage  but it would  be a dangerous conclusion to rely solely on embedded reporters.  He is not wholly against it, and adds, cautiously, that  embedding has worked, but that its limits have not yet  been tested. He adds, We will always need people on the  ground independently forging ahead, finding the stories.  He dismisses his own injury, saying  if someone crashes his car on his way to work you wouldnt  ask him if hed ever drive again. But whatever the outcome  of the debate on embedding journalists elsewhere in the  world, there is a lesson to be learnt from what happened  in Iraq. Hopefully, we will not have another war here on  the subcontinent, but if we do, even if it is a limited  conflict, it needs to be realized that embedding  when  the adversaries are not as ill-matched as the American-led  forces and the Iraqis, but more or less equal in strength   brings with it grave risks to the journalists with fighting  units, who may well be killed or taken prisoner. Worse,  the reports they will send will give not just the people  but also the senior commanders a picture that may well be  wrong and lead to dreadful consequences.  Independent coverage will always  be a risky business. Even in the one-sided Iraq conflict  13 reporters, cameramen and other media-workers lost their  lives, and many more were injured, like Stuart Hughes. But  it has to be the mainstay of any coverage that a news organization  provides of an armed conflict. There will be some who will  argue that such independent coverage may not get the cooperation  they would need from the military. But this argument will  not hold, for one very good reason. Whatever they may say about independent  media coverage, our Indian defence authorities will, in  actual fact, give it the cooperation it seeks, if for no  other reason than to eliminate the possibility of negative  stories being sent back. This does not mean that reporters  who feel that they are not getting the cooperation they  want from the military will immediately say that we are  doing badly when we are not; but they may well say that  the authorities refused to confirm or deny such and such  report, and that, in itself, may have an adverse effect  not just on people watching or reading such reports, but  eventually also on those actually engaged in the fighting.  That is something military commanders will not risk. And  let us not forget that the journalists who risk their lives  to cover a conflict are not immediately self-serving unpatriotic  people, as they have sometimes been called by angry military  authorities.  It is not a question of patriotism,  it is a question of what they are in the business for, and  for which they are willing to risk their lives: the truth,  which may sometimes be painful, but which needs to be reported  as it is.

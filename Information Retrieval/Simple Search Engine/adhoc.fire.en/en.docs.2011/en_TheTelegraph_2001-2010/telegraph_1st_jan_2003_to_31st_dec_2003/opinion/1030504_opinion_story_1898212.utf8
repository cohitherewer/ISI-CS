		 Sunday, May 04, 2003  SUMMER OF DISCONTENT
 - No growth without reform, and no support for reform without  growth  PRATAP BHANU MEHTA The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University Populist in a crisis A series of high impact strikes  in quick succession is a warning about the impending economic  unrest that lies ahead. The traders strike against value  added tax, the truckers strike against all manner of taxes,  the banking strike are all signals of turbulent economic  times. After almost a decade of low labour militancy, few  public sector strikes, we may be on the threshold of returning  to the kind of civil unrest that characterized politics  in the early Seventies. All indications are that growth  will slow down, inflation is creeping up and the general  outlook for economy is, at best, modest, despite all the  bluster of McKinsey reports targeting eight per cent growth.  Although the structure of the Indian economy and the prevailing  ideological climate are vastly different from the early  Seventies, the state is once again in serious crisis: unable  to endure both its current fiscal condition and the measures  needed to reform it. Simply put, we are in for a major  round of unrest because the central component of economic  reforms, reform of the state itself, has not even got off  the ground. During the Nineties India integrated into the  world economy with modest success and managed to successfully  deregulate some sectors of the economy. But the overall  impact of these measures on growth has been modest for many  reasons. The economy is still shackled by too many perverse  incentives that stem from state regulation. The state itself  spends most of the resources it generates unproductively  either on interest payments on its debt or on itself. State  investment in infrastructure and social services has been  almost stagnant.  A key component of economic reform  was to get the state to both use growth to generate more  resources and to use these resources more productively.  But this ambition depended upon the state being able to  reform itself in two ways. First, it would have to rationalize  its own functioning and second, it would have to free itself  from powerful lobbies and vested interests that were unproductively  draining away its resources. In a sense the difficult part  of the reform process is yet to be undertaken. What these strikes, taken together,  represent is growing opposition to reform. The opposition  does not come from any ideological challenge to the idea  of reform itself, but from the fact that no one wants to  pay the price. Since most lobbies are so used to looking  upon the state as a free lunch, any attempt by the state  to rationalize tax structures, to cut subsidies, to lower  its own wage burden, will provoke resistance. We all want  transparency in the state, but few of the most influential  political groups in the country want transparency in their  own dealings with the state. The Kelkar report was scuttled  as much by corporate anxiety over rational taxation as it  was by an uncertain middle class; the opposition behind  VAT was motivated at least as much by fear that tax evasion  would be more difficult as anything else; the opposition  to genuine power sector reform comes from all kinds of lobbies  used to free power; public sector reform will be opposed  by privileged public sector employees and so forth.  During the Nineties we avoided  a head on confrontation on these issues mainly because of  three reasons. First, in the Nineties we had a genuine balance  of payments crisis that allowed the political space for  some reform. Second, the economy, except for a brief period  continued to expand, allowing opportunities to be created.  Third, governments pursued what has been called reform  by stealth, an incremental measure here, confronting a  small lobby there and so forth. The net result was that  our discontent was mild and diffused. Oddly enough, Indias successful  management of its external sector, helped largely by remittances  and the information technology boom, has disguised the real  fiscal crisis of the state. The prospect of your gold being  shipped to the Bank of England, the threat of a run on your  currency concentrates the mind more than runaway internal  debt does. So once the external front was secured we continued  to behave as if the state could invent more and more money  out of thin air.  Unfortunately this was not a situation  that could last forever and the state had to, at some point,  confront the fiscal deficit. Someone has to pay. But who  will pay? The middle class thinks its taxed enough, business  thinks taxes will make it uncompetitive, agricultural tax  is politically unviable, and other traders and truckers  think that they are taxed too much and too arbitrarily.  Introducing rationality and fairness to any system of taxation  is immediately interpreted as a sign that one particular  group will be asked to carry a greater share of the burden.  Hence we are all resisting reform, out of convenience, if  not principle. The fiscal crisis of the state  is serious enough so that reform by stealth is no longer  an option. Many vested interests have to be challenged simultaneously  and they are going to resist together. Hence, we can expect  a crescendo of strikes of the likes of which we have not  seen of late. Second, the outlook for overall growth is  gloomy. This is only adding to economic anxiety and resistance  to the idea of reform. Indeed, in retrospect, it is clear  that we will pay a heavy price for not reforming the state  more when we had the political opportunity.  The crisis of the early Nineties  had given an opening, and the economy during much of the  subsequent decade gave enough of a cushion to take hard  decisions. But now we are in the tough situation of having  to undertake the most difficult of economic reforms in more  precarious economic times: a stagnant international economy,  lower growth and possibly higher inflation. We are in the  vicious circle that we cannot grow unless we reform more,  but there will be no political support for reform unless  we grow more. We are in for tumultuous economic times. The impact of this on politics  is uncertain. Most politicians respond to economic crisis  by turning populist as Indira Gandhi did. There are signs  that the Congress will traverse the same path. The Bharatiya  Janata Party will go slow on reform, although it has to  be said to its credit, that it has at least dared to open  the hard issues the Congress managed to mostly avoid. The  good news is that good old-fashioned things like inflation  and labour unions, public sector workers and disgruntled  agriculturalists, business lobbies and irate consumers,  may once again dominate politics. Praveen Togadia may have  to work harder to gain attention.  The bad news is that attention  to economic matters does not always mean that those matters  get politically resolved. Politics, currently at any rate,  is less about the art of the possible. It is more about  the skills of deferral and we can expect it to continue  on this path. But as the heat gets oppressive, water and  power scarce in most parts of the country, no one will be  in any doubt that a summer of economic discontent is upon  us.

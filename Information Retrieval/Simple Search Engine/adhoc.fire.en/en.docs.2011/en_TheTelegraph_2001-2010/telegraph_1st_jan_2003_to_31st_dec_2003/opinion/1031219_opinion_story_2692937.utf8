																								The Naresh Chandra committee was to draw up a road map for reforming civil aviation. Drawing on global experiences, it makes a host of recommendations and if the entire package is implemented, much more than Indian Airlines and Air India will be transformed. The recommendations encompass fiscal regimes for fuel, airports, security and existing and potential private players. The civil aviation ministry should cease to exist. Media attention has focused on some recommendations and not all. First, there is the privatization of Indian Airlines, Air India and Pawan Hans, using a package of strategic sales, initial public offers and transfer of management control. In the interim, Indian Airlines and Air India will be provided explicit subsidies for uneconomic routes and granted flexibility in acquiring aircraft, now that traffic rights will be given to private carriers and government servants are no longer mandated to travel on public carriers. This restructuring of Indian Airlines and Air India is least likely, because the civil aviation ministry is reluctant to let go of its own turf. That apart, opposition to privatization, as distinct from disinvestments through sale of minority shares, is well entrenched. Second, sourcing of aviation turbine fuel has been opened up and there are recommendations on rationalization and reduction of import duties, excise, Central sales tax and state-level sales tax.																								Inland and foreign travel taxes will be replaced by a sector-specific 5 per cent ad valorem cess, channelled into an essential air service fund that will make subsidization transparent not only for non-economic routes, but also for unviable airports. In the same vein, defence will have to pay user charges for air services. Third, entry of private carriers will be liberalized and this includes hike in foreign equity to 49 per cent. Domestic private airlines will be allowed overseas flights. Route dispersal norms will also be scrapped. The Competition Commission of India will have regulatory oversight to ensure competitive practices. Since all recommendations are unlikely to be implemented in a hurry, the probability of piecemeal implementation is high, and this will benefit existing private players like Jet and Sahara. Fourth, airport services will be privatized, but there will be no concessions or subsidies to new airports. Visa and immigration procedures will be streamlined. Fifth, air traffic services will be unbundled and the Airports Authority of India will become a government-owned corporation. There will be an Aviation Economic Regulatory Authority and the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security will have enhanced powers. The civil aviation minister is keen to establish his reformist credentials. So no doubt some recommendations will be implemented. Pity this benefits only existing private players.

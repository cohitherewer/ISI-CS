The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, October 20, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Clear and present danger				 																																																				Sir  It seems to be a case of once bitten, twice not shy for N. Chandrababu Naidu (CM fights shy of Black Cats, Oct 14). His rejection of the state cabinets proposal of extra security for him and his hesitation over accepting the Centres offer of protection by the National Security Guards do not bode well. Naidu says he is driven by the desire to raise the morale of his security forces, but it already has large chinks in its armour. Continuing with the same security arrangements is akin to writing his own death warrant. Also it would be a shot in the arm for the Naxal militants who are aware of the flaws in the chief ministers personal security cover. A successful assassination attempt would drive the final nail in Telegu Desam Partys coffin. The TDP, without its flamboyant and IT-savvy chief minister, is but a rudderless ship. Naidu should accept the Centres offer immediately for his own sake as well as that of his party.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Indranil Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																Noble choice				 																																																				Sir Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian human rights activist and lawyer, truly deserves the Nobel peace prize (Right to peace, Oct 14). But the decision of the Nobel peace prize committee is significant for more than one reason. First, terror strikes by jihadis in various parts of the world have led to a severe backlash against ordinary Muslims. A large section of the West believes that the community is the hub of international terrorism. The award will help change this perception of the Muslim world. It signals a recognition of the fact that much of the community believes in human rights and peace. Second, Ebadis success crowns her relentless work for individual rights and democracy in a country dominated by a conservative clergy. The fact that she even ignored the threat to her own safety reflects her commitment to the cause. Her success will inspire countless others fighting for a similar cause in different parts of the world. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Syeda Kulsum Khan, Chennai

				 																																																				Sir  Very few people have the courage to match their actions to their words. Shirin Ebadi is one of them (Free rebels urges Ebadi, Oct 16). The Nobel peace prize winners renewed call to free political dissidents languishing in Iranian jails is an indication that success has not gone to her head. Ebadi has decided to use the recognition that has come her way for a cause she believes in  justice and equality for political prisoners, women and human-rights activists in Iran. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Indranil Sen, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  The winds of change are blowing through Iran. The fact that Shirin Ebadi won this years Nobel peace prize is an indication of this. With a moderate as president, and, of course, with leaders like Ebadi, the fledgling reform movement in the country is finally headed in the right direction. Ebadis Nobel and the resultant international fame will be a thorn in the flesh of the conservative mullahs. Wonder how the proponents of change will tackle the wrath of the hardliners?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sabyasachi Guha, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Although Shirin Ebadis contributions to the pro-democracy movement in Iran cannot be ignored, I think the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, would have been more deserving of the Nobel peace prize. Annans tenure has been full of challenges, the Iraq war, the west Asian crisis and 9/11 being some of them. His efforts to resolve crises have been truly commendable. The Nobel committee should take note of this.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Rituraj Kalita, Guwahati 

				 																																																				Sir  The guarded response of Muslim leaders, clerics and the Urdu media in India to Shirin Ebadis honour was disappointing (Reform divide in Nobel hush, Oct 13). There are two reasons for the lukewarm response  Ebadi is a woman and her reformist campaign has been dubbed as dissent by the Islamic society. It is a pity that the hardline sections of the Islamic world give a bad name to their liberal counterparts through their actions.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																All play, no work				 																																																				Sir  Government resources are scarce and are thus better utilized for alleviating poverty and improving infrastructure. But this logic is beyond the understanding of Indias current crop of political leaders ( Mulayam misses ministry ton, Oct 4). Mulayam Singh Yadav may feel that by creating more portfolios, he is ensuring that each member of his coalition cabinet in Uttar Pradesh has been accommodated effectively. But he is only adding to the pressure on the exchequer. A large cabinet also means that there will be little work for each minister. Thus a minister would enjoy his perks despite being underemployed. Putting politics before public welfare is an established norm in Indian politics today and Yadav is no exception to this rule.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The Sarkaria commission had recommended that the number of ministers in a cabinet should not exceed one-tenth of the size of the house. Mulayam Singh Yadav has grossly flouted this guideline. The judiciary should take note and give exemplary punishment to the guilty. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Mulayam Singh Yadavs jumbo cabinet could solve the unemployment problem in the state since each minister will need a huge retinue of personal staff to do his domestic and official chores. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
C.V.K. Moorthy, Calcutta

		 Friday, July 18, 2003 				 WAITING FOR THE TOOTH FAIRY
 GWYNNE DYER																								Every night when they go to bed, the American president, George W. Bush, and the British prime minister, Tony Blair, each tuck a tooth under their pillows. Theyve been good boys and they won their war fair and square, so surely one of these days the tooth fairy will come and leave some Iraqi weapons of mass destruction in its place. But the days turn into weeks and months, still the tooth fairy doesnt come.																								Meanwhile, the crowd outside is getting ugly  especially in Britain, where Blairs credibility has been severely damaged by the perception that he distorted what the intelligence services actually said in order to manufacture a case for following the United States of America into war. Public outrage in the US is still at an earlier stage and will probably only grow in step with mounting American casualties in occupied Iraq, but some awkward questions are being asked at last.																								So one cheer for the fact that (some of) the truth is finally coming out, but where were all these newspapers and politicians in the months leading up to the invasion of Iraq? You had to be wilfully blind not to know at the time what they are now discovering in such breathless shock  that the US and British governments were telling brazen lies in order to manipulate their peoples into supporting the war. Media shy																								Why would anybody in their right mind have believed that the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme, completely dismantled by United Nations arms inspectors in the early Nineties, could have revived since the UN teams were withdrawn in 1998 despite sanctions, and have advanced so fast that it already posed an urgent threat to America and Britain by 2003? 																								As for chemical and biological weapons, it turns out that Saddam Hussein was telling the truth when he said Iraq had destroyed them all in 1991-92, but it wouldnt have mattered much if he had been lying. He had no delivery vehicles to get them beyond his immediate neighbourhood if they had existed, nor were terrorists going to deliver them for him. Quite apart from the lack of a plausible motive for such an attack, there was no evidence that Saddam Husseins Iraq had ever had any connection with Islamist terrorism. Three months after the war, there still isnt.																								And any journalist with decent contacts in Washington or London would have been aware that for most of the past year, the Central Intelligence Agency and the MI5 were desperately signalling from behind the curtain that the story being peddled by their political masters was not what the professionals really believed at all. But the leaks just werent being followed up by most of the mainstream US and British media. Why not? Truth at last																								In the US its mostly down to post-9/11 chill: most American journalists were reluctant to question their governments truthfulness in a perceived time of crisis. Despite the recent flurry of reporting on the bogus uranium purchase that featured in Bushs eve-of-war speech, this chill still restricts the range and tone of stories in the US media, and will probably continue to do so unless the aftermath in Iraq gets completely out of hand. 																								In Britain it was always more nuanced. Of the eight national dailies, only the five whose owners have strong North American ties and large interests there  the ex-Australian, Rupert Murdoch (now a US citizen to get around US media ownership laws), and the ex-Canadian, Conrad Black (who traded in his Canadian citizenship for a British title),  blindly supported the Bush-Blair line. British-owned papers and the BBC were more doubtful from the start, and by now the rest of the media has been forced to follow suit.																								Its impossible to say if the unravelling of the lies will ultimately ruin Bush or Blair: they are both adroit politicians who know how to turn the publics short attention span to their advantage. But the tooth fairy is clearly not going to show up  and the truth fairy is on her way at last.

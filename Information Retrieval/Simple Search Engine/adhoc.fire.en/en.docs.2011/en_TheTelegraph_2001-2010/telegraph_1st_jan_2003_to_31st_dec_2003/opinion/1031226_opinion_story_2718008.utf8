		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 BRIEF EXPOSURE
																								The recent disclosures regarding Pakistans export of nuclear weapons technology have predictably generated international alarm. While the alleged transfer of sensitive technology seems to have taken place a few years back, concern about the safety and security of Pakistans nuclear programme is bound to grow. There will also be greater international scrutiny of the role played by the armed forces in the export. The recent revelation is the result of a collaborative investigation by American and European intelligence agencies. This was provoked by evidence discovered during a systematic study of Irans secret nuclear programme. The evidence pointed to Pakistan as the crucial source of sensitive technology. Indeed, documents provided by Iran itself to inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency suggest that Pakistani scientists and companies were the vital sources of key blueprints, technical guidance and equipment for a proposed uranium-enrichment plant. Most critically, it is believed that Mr A.Q. Khan, widely regarded as the father of Pakistans nuclear programme, was directly responsible for this transfer. Recall that Mr Khan, a metallurgist, was  in the past  charged with stealing European designs for enriching uranium to further Pakistans nuclear programme. Given the mounting evidence, the government of Pakistan has now, of course, conceded that some transfer may have taken place without the knowledge of the government. It has also admitted that some of its nuclear scientists were being debriefed following information by the IAEA. Reports from Pakistan have suggested that the movements of Mr Khan, who has also established the Khan Research Laboratories at Kahuta, had been restricted. And at least two scientists from Khan Research Laboratories, the countrys top nuclear laboratory, have been held for questioning, including its former director-general, Mr Mohammad Farooq. This may well be the tip of the iceberg. 																								New reports from Washington suggest even a link between Pakistan and Libyas and North Koreas nuclear programmes. It is believed that shipments of sensitive nuclear-related technology were made from Pakistan to North Korea. The decision by Libya to dismantle its nuclear installations has also put Pakistan in a spot. Libyas nuclear equipment included centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon. Again, Pakistan is believed to be the source of the centrifuges. Concern about Pakistans nuclear programme will grow in the days to come. If indeed it is proven that Pakistan proliferated technology to states that the United States of America views with deep concern, the Washington-Islamabad relationship could be in deep trouble. More critically, if there is evidence that the military may have played a role in the transfer, it could provoke more direct action from the US.

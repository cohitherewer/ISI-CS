 - The Palestinians are the greatest obstacle to American empire-building  ACHIN VANAIK The author is a political scientist  and has recently published the book, Communalism Contested:  Religion, Modernity and Secularization The takeover of Iraq is the first  step in the effective re-colonization of west Asia, only  this time by the United States of America, with Britain  playing the role of faithful batman. There are many things  to be done in this regard, like ensuring long-term control  of Iraq, subduing Iran, perhaps dividing up Saudi Arabia,  reasserting Israeli influence in southern Lebanon and so  on. But at the heart of this project is the resolution of  the Palestine issue. Without this, the region cannot be  stabilized.  Even before the assault began,  Tony Blair and George W. Bush were talking of soon unveiling  a roadmap for a peace settlement between Israel and the  Palestinians. Sure enough, after the military victory in  Baghdad, pressure was put on Syria, partly to dissuade it  from opposing US plans to consolidate its control over Iraq  but mainly because of the Palestine issue. Syria is a key support-base for  Hizbollah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which are among the  leading forces organizing continued resistance to Israel  in Lebanon and within the occupied territories. Syria is  also the only major state in the region, which remains strongly  hostile to Israel because of the latters unwillingness  to give all of the Golan Heights back in return for a separate  peace with Syria. Furthermore, the one major military-political  defeat that Israel has ever suffered was in Lebanon when  its troops finally had to pull out of the South because  of the resistance of Shiites behind the Hizbollah. Again,  the key force preventing Israel or the US from fully manipulating  the Lebanese government is the power and influence of Syria  within that country.  The new roadmap is meant only  to get going the political process of negotiating a solution  to the Palestine issue, since contrary to the original expectations  of the US and Israel, the Oslo Accord process has completely  collapsed. This roadmap is meant to clear the way for a  final settlement that will give nominal independence or  statehood to Palestine but will, in reality, mean the permanent  economic, political and military subordination of the new  state to Israel  that is, a final Bantustan-type solution  of the issue.  To achieve this, it is necessary  that a) Syria and the other Arab regimes be brought into  line to give their endorsement to such a solution; b)  Israeli and American power be even further institutionalized  in the region so as to make any other outcome than this  impossible or inconceivable; and c) the Palestinian leadership  be coerced and persuaded to play its appointed role of chief  Quisling.  With regard to the first condition,  now that Iraq has been taken over, only Syria and to some  extent Iran are a problem. The other regimes like Jordan,  Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Lebanon are either so beholden to  the US or so authoritarian and deeply unpopular that the  last thing they want is a genuinely independent Palestine.  This would mean the victory of the strong- est national-popular  resistance anywhere in the world, effectively sounding the  death-knell for their own governments because such a victory  would greatly arouse the people of the whole of the Arab  world with consequences very dangerous for these regimes.  The second condition is also being fulfilled. As for the  third condition, this is what the US and Israel are in the  process of establishing.  The great tragedy of the Palestinian  people, and their incredible struggle, is that few other  national liberation movements have had to suffer as inept,  corrupt and shameful a leadership. Yasser Arafat has an  assured place in history as once the key symbolic expression  of the independent emergence and continuity of a powerful  Palestinian national liberation movement. But his crucial  political degeneration took place after the end of the Cold  War and the US victory in the first Gulf War of 1991 when  he decided that he had no other choice but to decisively  compromise on the goal of an honourable and just independence  in favour of some kind of Bantustan-type resolution that  would leave him and his cohorts as internationally recognized  (that is, American-endorsed) leaders. He was supposed to  see the Oslo Accords through to their final denouement.  The fundamental meaning of these  accords was that, first, Arafat should trade in his most  important political-diplomatic asset  recognition of Israel   not for an equivalent recognition of the right of Palestinians  to an independent state, but only for the recognition of  the PLO as the authentic representative of the Palestinian  people. Second, the PLO, now re-christened as the Palestinian  National Authority, would get some municipal-level powers  of autonomy over limited parts of the occupied territories.  Even the expansion of such municipal reach would depend  on Israels agreement. Israel judges the good behaviour  of the PNA and rewards or penalizes it accordingly. Israel  would control water, security (complete military domination  over the occupied territories) and all exit and entry points,  and even public movement within the West Bank or between  it and Gaza or Jerusalem.  Third, it was made clear informally  that any realistic final settlement would allow most of  the illegal Israeli settlements to remain. Therefore there  could be no question of the new Palestine state either having  contiguous territorial control or sovereignty, or getting  back east Jerusalem or having an independent armed force  (this would threaten Israeli security). Also, Israeli forces  would remain in strategically designated positions within  the new configuration; nor would Israel ever acknowledge  its guilt for ethnic cleansing and robbery of the lands  and properties of Palestinians in the 1948 exodus or for  sustaining the longest illegal military occupation in modern  history (since 1967); nor would it provide reparations for  all these crimes.  In short, the new Palestine state  could only enjoy limited sovereignty, and Israel would never  admit the injustice it has done to the people of Palestine.  This is not a recipe for lasting peace, which requires respect  for the equal dignity of all and therefore acknowledgement  of wrongdoing wheth- er by former colonial powers or the  former upholders of apartheid or by Germany for Nazi brutality  to Jews or by Israel to the Palestinians. But the Oslo Accords collapsed  despite Arafats commitment to making them work because  in the final analysis, the Palestinian people refused to  give in to a peace without genuine justice. The Oslo Accords  failure made Arafat irrelevant to the US and Israel. With  the regional and global relationship of forces shifting  even more in their favour after this second Gulf War, a  new Oslo-type process requires a new leadership of the PLO   Mahmoud Abbas  to push it through. Whether or not US  or Israel succeeds in imposing a new settlement of peace  without justice, remains to be seen. Most other governments  outside the region such as in Europe, or governments like  that of India, would be happy to wash their hands of, once  and for all, over the Palestinian issue. An internationally  acknowledged resolution of this problem would then leave  such governments freer to deepen their relations with the  US and Israel. In the long run, even a Bantustan  solution will not bring lasting peace precisely because  it demands the permanent subordination of a people. But  the US and Israel will be more than happy if it enhances  their regional dominance over several decades. So the Palestinians  stand alone, as they have had to for a long time now. Yet  it is their heroic struggle against all odds that continues  to create the single greatest weak spot in the US efforts  to build a global empire.

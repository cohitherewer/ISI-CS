		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 THAT LIFT WHICH THEY SING ABOUT
 Shobita Punja																								There is much talk these days about the common school system, free and compulsory education and that India has not fulfilled her vow to give at least primary education to all the children in this country.																								Has anyone asked Generation Next what they want? What is it that our kids need? The success of the Indian Generation Now in the world out there is a fact. As a country, we did nothing really to help this generation find a place in the world  they did it themselves. They went to the sweat shops, the hole-in-the-wall computer centres and slogged for the treasured few seats in the Indian Institutes of Technology and made it because they are basically clever. They have that something that is very Indian and makes them successful with chips. They work hard, harder than most  perhaps because they are haunted by the memory of poverty. They have an edge  now they want attitude. We need to give them that attitude, give them that lift they sing about.																								If we use films popular in India as a means to understanding what this generation wants, then we need to look at Bend it like Beckham and Bollywood Blues or even Lagaan as indicators. These films, although heavily romanticized, suggest that our young ones are yearning for a contemporary India that they can be proud of, where caste and religion do not interfere with their ambitions, so that they come out as winners. They want to play in the international playing field. What they seem to be asking for is a broad, liberal, secular outlook, so that they can fit anywhere in the world. An edge over others																								Listen to their fusion music, dance and strange blend of fashion, and it is clear that they are searching for a head-start over their contemporaries from other countries. When abroad and in India, the Now Generation seem to want to be rooted in their culture to give them that edge over others. They want to be distinct, give something special, but free of the chains of caste and religion. They seem to want something that sounds like an echo of Mahatma Gandhis words about opening windows to all cultures while being rooted in ones own culture.																								In Lagaan, the aspiration is revealing. A young English Rose falls in love with our local dhoticlad hero. The love remains unrequited. The love of the West for India has a long history  what with the Seventies Flower Children and the present-day packaging of yoga gurus and the reversal of the ageing processes with ayurveda beauty products. But surely, India has more to offer than the Goodness Gracious Me takes on the Kama Sutra. The world will listen																								Our local dhoti-clad hero of Lagaan was illiterate, from a drought-ravaged village  but ingenuous. Ingenuity does not have to go to school  it is born of pluck, courage, creativity and a desire to know and win. Our artists, through the ages, have lived in poverty, excluded from social mobility and education, but have kept India alive with music, dance and the beauty of everyday objects. But do our young recognize this mystique and magic of India, and do they have roots? Do they even believe that the world could be in love with them?																								How do we give our kids what they deserve? First we have to give children in school the opportunity to know their heritage  they need to know that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Mega-artists and art-makers, who created the Taj Mahal, the temples of Tanjore, the music of our gharanas, the elegance of our dancers and the embroidered textiles that we export.																								At our present rate of growth, every seventh person in the world is an Indian, and in 2010, more than half our population will be under the age of 15 years. That means that if we address the question now, we can colour the world. We need not be surprised if the world sees our films, listens to our music and covets our fabrics. If our beat is unique and rhythmic, traditional and contemporary, then the world will listen.

																								Secularism is an absolute value. It should be valued absolutely. One cannot be a secularist one day and a soft Hindutvawallah the day after. Ms Sonia Gandhi has an identity problem but this has nothing to do with the fact that she is an Italian born Indian political leader. It is to do with the absence of direction which has become almost the hallmark of her leadership of the Congress. Her recent cry to form a united front to defend secularism sounds hollow because in Gujarat, earlier this year, she started her election campaign from a temple and in Madhya Pradesh, in the elections just concluded, she allowed Mr Digvijay Singh to peddle a soft Hindutva line. This yoyo brand of secularism is open to the suspicion of insincerity. Ms Gandhi, if she really wants to defeat communalism  and not merely defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party  will have to make up her mind about what she believes in as a principle. Secularism cannot be reduced to an instrument for gaining office. It has to be an article of faith. Ms Gandhi fails to sound convincing because she is perhaps not convinced herself. This indecision is writ large in her approach to other critical issues, the most important example being her attitude to economic reforms. She wavers between being a closet socialist and being a reluctant reformer.																								It would appear from the sequence of events that for Ms Gandhi, secularism is second or third best. She did not make it the focus of her election campaign in the four states in which the Congress was trying to remain in power  Rajasthan, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Both the BJP and the Congress fought the elections on governance. In three of the four states, the Congress failed. The appeal to do battle under the banner of secularism comes after those failures. It is significant that when the BJP, for reasons of its own, steered clear of its core ideology, Hindutva, and campaigned as the party of better governance, the electorate of three very big states chose it over the Congress. At least in north India, the Congress is no longer the preferred party of governance. Under the circumstances, Ms Gandhis appeal to defend secularism will be seen by the Congresss potential allies as emanating from weakness. She might also discover to her dismay that she is an obstacle to the formation of the secular front she envisages. More profoundly, she might recognize the increasing irrelevance of secularism as a major issue in Indian politics. The differences between the BJP and the Congress are being blurred. But this is not to suggest that Ms Gandhi is becoming as acceptable as Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee. On the contrary.

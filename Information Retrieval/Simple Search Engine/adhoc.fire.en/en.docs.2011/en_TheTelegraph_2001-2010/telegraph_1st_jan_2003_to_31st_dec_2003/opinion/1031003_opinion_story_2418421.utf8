 Madhumita Bhattacharyya Still besotted  My Passage from India By Ismail  Merchant, Roli, $ 35  Charming is the word that comes  to mind about Ismail Merchant and his films. My Passage  from India lives up to the reputation of the man. Merchants  autobiographical account speaks with the same candour, humour  and zest as its author. Indian audiences may not readily  associate the products of Merchant Ivory Productions with  the crossover film genre, in the same way as they do Bend  it Like Beckham or Monsoon Wedding (though neither  of these are Indian either, except in theme). But Ismail  Merchant, born and brought up in Mumbai, who bulldozed his  way into an utterly alien land (New York) pursuing a single-minded  dream (filmmaking), is surely one of the pioneers of this  genre, making a mark for himself long before India became  saleable. Life in Mumbai was good for Merchant.  The only son of a large family, as a boy and young man,  Merchant was given freedom to explore. This early freedom  is what perhaps fuelled his fearless attitude towards filmmaking. Merchant Ivory Productions shot  to international fame with period pieces adapted from literature   A Room with a View, Howards End and The  Remains of the Day, and that is what most contemporary  audiences are likely to remember. But the Indo-British partnership  of 40 years also produced films like The Householder,  Shakespeare Wallah and Bombay Talkie, consistently  casting the likes of Shashi Kapoor and wife Jennifer Kendal,  Saeed and Madhur Jaffrey, Zohra Sehgal and even Aparna Sen.  Satyajit Ray scored the music for Shakespeare Wallah,  even encouraging Merchant, then a mere greenhorn, to go  for the international festival circuit. A large number of photographs,  both black-and-white and colour, liven up this book. The  final snapshot of Merchant with director James Ivory and  writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala captures a touching moment between  the three collaborators. Merchants brushes with dignitaries  of the film, political and literary worlds are well documented  through these. From childhood to the present day, he has  been captured alongside the likes of Jinnah, Aldous Huxley,  Nehru, John Kenneth Galbraith, Ivory, Vivien Leigh, Queen  Elizabeth, Goldie Hawn, seen receiving the Padma Bhusan.  Some remarkable stills from films and production shots make  for attractive visuals. Though Merchant and his films  may not generate the kind of hype that has become customary  for any international film with an Indian connection, this  producer-turned-director has not let this  or the perennial  lack of funding  stop him from experimenting with the medium.  He and his partners have moved from project to project,  both feature and documentary, that have only one thing in  common  lack of financial backing. This was only possible, according  to Merchants account, because he depended on an extended  filmmaking family that included the Kapoor clan, the Jaffreys,  friends of Ivory and Jhabvala. The producer did not hesitate  to don any hat necessary  actor, chauffeur, chef  for  the greater good. If My Passage to India is to be  trusted entirely, it were Merchants enthusiasm, and legendary  powers of persuasion (which apparently scared even a possessive  V.S. Naipaul into handing over the rights of The Mystic  Masseur), that made 40 films possible. Merchant does not dwell too long  on the details of filmmaking. Nor does he delve into landmark  partnerships with James Ivory and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.  This brief narrative captures the man  frenzied, passionate  and utterly dedicated  who rose from oblivion to live the  dream of a 14-year-old besotted with the screen star Nimmi.  His magic stems from this eager, even adolescent, infatuation  which he continues to nurture for filmmaking. MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 CURBING IMMORAL RIGHTS
 							 - The Supreme Court has not negated workers right to strike, but restated an existing law N.R. Madhava Menon The author is vice-chancellor, West  Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Calcutta The recent judgment of the Supreme  Court in the matter of Tamil Nadu government employees  strike has evoked sharp reactions supporting and opposing  the availability of a democratic remedy long believed to  be part of labour jurisprudence in the country. Much of  the criticism appears to have been advanced on the wrong  assumption that the court was negativizing the right of  workers to strike under industrial law. In fact, the issue  before the court was limited to strike by civil servants  who are governed by the Constitution and the civil services  regulations rather than by the Industrial Disputes Act.																								Right is an interest or a benefit protected by law. In this regard, moral and equitable rights have to be distinguished as they depend on social consensus and cultural traditions rather than on law. The nature and extent of the interest protected are laid down by the law: as also the limits and restrictions on them. In other words, no right known to law is absolute and all rights are subject to reasonable restrictions and are available only so long as they are invoked within the stipulated conditions. That is why there is the concept of legal and illegal strikes. Illegal strikes or strikes accompanied by violence are no more considered as rights but are actionable as torts and crimes under appropriate laws. 																								Again, in an environment where freedom is taken as licence and where rights are claimed in total disregard of corresponding duties, there is utter confusion about what is legal and what is legitimate in a constitutional democracy. There is no mention of right to strike in the chapter on fundamental rights in the Constitution. What the Constitution provides is freedom to assemble peacefully without arms or to form associations or to seek remedies under law whenever the rights are threatened. The democratic right to protest (collective bargaining) is part of the right to freedom. Article 19, which guarantees these rights, stipulates the limits of their exercise and empowers the state to put reasonable restrictions on the enjoyment of these rights in the interest of public order, security of the state or interests of general public. In applying the test of reasonableness of restrictions, the broad criterion followed is whether the law strikes a proper balance between public interests on the one hand and the rights of individuals on the other hand. This is ultimately for the court to decide. In the context of the Tamil Nadu government servants strike, therefore, the issue is whether the action taken by the government in dismissing employees en masse is justified and whether the law under which it was done (the Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act, 2002 and the Ordinance No. 3 of 2003) is constitutionally valid, that is, whether it can pass the test of reasonable restriction under Article 19 (2).																								Politicians and political parties who depend on vote bank politics among the working class for their own survival have been misinterpreting laws and judicial decisions whenever they found them inconvenient to their vested interests. After the end of the Cold War and the adoption of market economy in country after country, there emerged a struggle between ideologies and practices in countries like India. It is in this context that one has to appreciate the support and opposition to the Supreme Courts refusal to accept any right to strike on the part of government employees. Very recently, the court was called upon to examine whether lawyers (who are not employees of government, but independent professionals licensed to provide public services) have a right to go on strike. Taking into consideration the resulting harm to society, the court declared that lawyers have no such right as distinguished from collective protest short of striking work. A similar view was taken when bank employees went on strike. 																								This is the considered view of the court in respect of whether going on strike is part of a fundamental right (Article 19 on right to freedom) guaranteed by the Constitution. Peaceful protest without serious disruption of public life is still part of the right to freedom and right to access justice. But when serious harm results to others, the right becomes a wrong, a legal strike becomes an illegal one and government interventions become reasonable restrictions on the right.																								In the case of government servants (unlike industrial workers), not only is there no fundamental right to go on strike, but also an express prohibition against strike under the government servants conduct rules. Rule 22 provides that no Government servant shall engage himself in strike or in incitements thereto or in similar activities. Since the rule is not declared an unreasonable restriction, it is constitutionally permissible in public interest. In the circumstances, the court legitimately ruled that the government servants did not have even a statutory right to strike. Therefore, every strike by government servants is illegal under the existing law.																								This raises the question of remedies available to government servants to fight injustice. After all, access to justice is the most fundamental of all constitutional rights. The Constitution has provided special service privileges and protection to civil servants under Article 311 and has empowered the state to set up administrative tribunals (besides the ordinary courts available to every citizen) to process disputes and complaints of persons in public services. Their salaries and allowances are revised periodically through recommendations of specially appointed pay commissions. 																								Today, over 90 per cent of state revenue is spent on maintaining the civil services, leaving little for development work. Considering the rising unemployed populations and those living below the poverty line, the government servants are a privileged and pampered lot in the country today. As such, going on strike en masse to compel the government to increase pension benefits and the like is prima facie immoral, illegal and unjustified. This is the view the court took in the matter. However, the court took a lenient view on behalf of the employees to read an element of injustice in the governments action in dismissing over two lakhs of them. The court felt that despite the act and the rules possibly permitting such action, it was an unequal situation and the employees capacity to resist state action was very limited. Many employees were compelled by their leaders or blindly followed others when they went on strike. 																								In this view of the matter, to meet the ends of justice, the court directed reinstatement of dismissed employees on their tendering an unconditional apology and a promise to abide by the law. The court also wanted the government to ensure that it would not take disciplinary action against those who went on strike (permissible under the rules) but confine disciplinary action to those who indulged in violence and against whom a first information report had been lodged. No break in service would result because of going on strike, said the court. Furthermore, the claims of those who are not reinstated would be heard expeditiously by three retired high court judges to be named by the chief justice and their decisions made binding on the state government. Employees aggrieved by the decision of these judges can appeal in an appropriate forum. It is submitted that it is a case where the court attempted a difficult task of upholding the law and securing public interest while ensuring the state action does not result in injustice to employees.																								Thus, reading the judgment one finds the following propositions of law emerging out of it. One, there is no fundamental or legal right for government servants to go on strike. Though the court said that there is not even a moral or equitable right to do so, the matter is still open as the law is still not clear on the issue. Two, government employees, if they have grievances, have to seek alternative procedures which are specially made available to them under the Constitution and the laws. Collective bargaining is still a valid right available to them but not strike which put the society to irreparable harm.																								Three, the denial of right to strike for government servants (conduct rules) is reasonable restriction on the right to freedom as provided in Article 19 (2). It is so, on balancing of individual right with interest of public at large and the rights of those intended to be served by public servants. Four, the exceptional step of mass dismissal of employees taken by the government under the Tamil Nadu Essential Services Maintenance Act and ordinance is to be tested for its constitutional validity through separate action and no judgment on its validity is passed by the court.																								From a correct reading of the judgment it is clear that what the court has done is a restatement of the existing law as applicable to government servants and not negation of right to strike of workers generally. Secondly, the Supreme Court, being not only a court of law but also a court of justice, has done what is expected of it in providing justice to the aggrieved government servants even when their actions were not justified under law. Thirdly, the court has clarified the elementary principle that every right is subject to reasonable restrictions and a right will cease to be a right once it has crossed those restrictions. Balancing individual rights and public or social interests is essentially a function of the court under a rule of law society and no one can despise the court for doing its constitutional duty. Those elements who still condemn the judgment and deliberately incite civil servants to sabotage the rule of law by going on strike are doing a distinct disservice to democracy, human rights and rule of law.

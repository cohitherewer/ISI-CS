 - What criteria should one use to decide whether a district  is backward?  Bibek Debroy The author is director Rajiv Gandhi  Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi Increasing inter-state disparities  across India has received some attention and the question  of convergence versus divergence across states is  often debated. Did the reform decade of the Nineties accentuate  inter-state disparities? And what can be done to ensure  that trickle-down benefits of growth percolate to all regions  and some backward areas are not bypassed? India is not sui  generis in raising such questions. The divergence between  north-west China and the southern coastal provinces has  probably received much more attention. Divergence or convergence is of  course a function of the variable used to measure it. The  two most commonly used indicators are growth in per capita  state domestic product or the poverty ratio (head count  ratio). On the former, the growth records of Gujarat or  Maharashtra in the Nineties are hardly comparable to the  growth records of Orissa or undivided Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.  If growth in per capita SDP is the yardstick, then inter-state  disparities existed in the Eighties as well. But the conclusion  that these disparities increased in the Nineties also seems  fairly robust.  Similarly, on poverty ratios,  Goa, Punjab or Haryana are hardly comparable to Orissa or  undivided Bihar. Arguably, the post-1991 reforms shifted  the focus of policy change from the Centre to the states.  In a federal country, most factor markets are either on  the state or concurrent lists. Hence, the agenda of second-generation  reforms includes items that require changes at state level.  Agriculture, social infrastructure and most areas of physical  infrastructure are cases in point. If reform inclinations  vary across states, it logically follows that so must growth  rates. And this is compounded by the phenomenon that many  faster growing states tend to have lower rates of population  growth. Sick public sector units also tended to be concentrated  in certain geographical regions and these are not the regions  that have exhibited high (private-sector-driven) employment  growth in the Nineties. In discussing inter-state disparities,  the East versus the West or the North versus  the South dichotomy is often emphasized. This East versus  the West dichotomy, with a vertical line drawn through Kanpur,  has some validity, subject to the caveat that undivided  Uttar Pradesh is an extremely heterogeneous state, with  the eastern parts somewhat different from the western, Noida  being an obvious example. The North versus the South  dichotomy, with a horizontal line drawn through the Vindhyas,  also has some validity, with growth rates in Tamil Nadu,  Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh picking up in the Nineties.  But like all generalizations,  these hide as much as they reveal. The identification of  poverty and backwardness with the BIMARU (Bihar, Madhya  Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) states, with a pun  on the word bimar, is a bit more robust. However, Rajasthan  clearly no longer belongs to the classic BIMARU fold and  Madhya Pradesh also seems to be climbing out. Conversely,  Orissa exhibits many BIMARU characteristics. And how do  Uttaranchal, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh fit into the BIMARU  identification? More important, why is one interested  in identifying pockets of deprivation? While not negating  the possibility of differential relative growth-rates across  the country or attempting to neutralize it, the answer must  be that one is interested in policy interventions that ensure  uniform access to market opportunities across the country,  quite apart from the socio-economic tensions that marginalization  leads to. Liberalization does not mean an abdication of  the states responsibility. Instead, it should be interpreted  as a refocusing of state intervention, with an emphasis  on social (education, health) and physical (power, water)  infrastructure, or even governance.  The tension over better-performing  states effectively cross-subsidizing states that have relatively  inferior track records needs to be viewed in this light.  However, development or deprivation does not necessarily  follow state boundaries, which are at best, administratively  determined. Unfortunately, policy intervention in India  is too centralized.  This does not only mean overwhelming  emphasis on the Centre in Centre-state relations, as all  states invariably argue, but it also means negligible emphasis  on decentralization and devolution within states, a point  that states rarely make. Hence, while policy intervention  is indeed needed to tackle problems of poverty and deprivation,  identification of backward regions needs to go beyond state  boundaries. Laveesh Bhandari and I have just undertaken  such an exercise at the district-level and the book has  been published on 23rd August by Konark Publishers. How does one decide whether a  district is backward? What criteria should one use? Poverty  ratios provide an obvious indicator and indeed poverty ratios  have earlier been used by the planning commission to identify  backward districts. However, it is possible to go beyond  poverty ratios and the identification in our exercise is  pegged to the millenium development goals. This makes it  more broad-based than earlier attempts. The international  development goals (or the millenium development goals) were  accepted as targets to be attained by 2015. It is a separate  matter that most developing countries, including India,  are way behind target. There are eight millenium development  goals, some specific, others less so. (1) Halve, between 1990 and 2015,  the proportion of people whose income is less than $ 1 a  day. As a further objective, halve, between 1990 and 2015,  the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, measured  as prevalence of underweight children or the proportion  of population below minimum levels of dietary energy consumption.  (2) Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and  girls alike, are able to complete a full course of primary  schooling. (3) Eliminate gender disparity in primary and  secondary education preferably by 2005 and in all levels  of education no later than 2015. (4) Reduce by two-thirds,  between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate and  obvious indicators are the under-five mortality rate, the  infant mortality rate and the proportion of one-year-old  children immunized against measles. (5) Reduce by three-quarters,  between 1990 and 2015, the maternal mortality ratio. (6)  Halt by 2015 and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS.  As an additional goal, halt by 2015 and begin to reverse  the incidence of malaria and other major diseases. (7) Integrate  the principles of sustainable development into country policies  and programs and reverse the loss of environmental resources.  In addition, halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without  sustainable access to safe drinking water. (8) Develop an  open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading  and financial system. The first five goals are more  specific, with quantifiable targets, than the last three.  But even on the first five, data availability at the district-level  is often a constraint. Hence, data on under-five mortality  rates or maternal mortality rates are less than satisfactory.  The identification in our exercise is therefore based on  six indicators  income poverty (poverty ratios), hunger,  infant mortality rate, immunization, literacy rate and enrollment  ratios. In addition, gender disparity is highlighted through  female and male literacy rates, but not actually used in  the process of identifying backwardness. Data used are estimates  for 2001. Poverty ratios show backward districts  not only in undivided BIMARU states, but also in Gujarat,  Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa,  West Bengal and the Northeast. Hunger (defined in National  Sample Survey terms) exhibits a similar spatial distribution,  but is less universal than poverty and is also more concentrated  towards the East and the Northeast. Other than a few neighbouring  districts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and the North-east,  the infant mortality rate identifies undivided BIMARU and  Orissa. Lack of immunization is geographically a more serious  problem, with a clear North versus South divide.  Low literacy rates are spread throughout the country and  expectedly, this is also mirrored in gross enrollment rates. I will have more to say on backward  districts in the next article.

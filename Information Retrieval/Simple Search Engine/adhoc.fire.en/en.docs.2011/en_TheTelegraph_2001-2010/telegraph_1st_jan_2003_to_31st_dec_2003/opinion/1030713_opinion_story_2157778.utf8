		 Sunday, July 13, 2003  A WALK AROUND SCHOENEBERG
 - Memories of that empty, homogeneous time  AMIT CHAUDHURI  amitchaudhurihotmail.com		 Beyond the wallIts now more than a month that  I entered Berlin for the first time. I may as well say it  was the first time I entered Germany. Once, in 1973, a Switzerland-bound  train I was in with my parents stopped for a few minutes  at Bonn, then West Germanys nondescript capital. A soldier  came into our compartment and sat opposite us, and got off  at the next stop: it seems fantastic, but it is true. For  many years, this was my only claim to having been in Germany. We flew into the Tegel airport;  oddly, for a capital city, there is no pre-eminent international  airport in Berlin. This is in keeping with its history;  its once-lapsed status, its division into two cities, its  rehabilitation after reunification. Even its lack of a single  international airport seems to be located in its inward,  traumatic complexity; its shyness of landmarks and its proliferation  of them; its dubious but continuing fascination with its  emblems of the past; its being situated in this constant  narrative of relocation  mental, ideological, physical,  geographic. So, there is the old city centre and the new  city centre, the old town hall and the new town hall;  but these inscriptions of old and neware themselves  fairly recent, and dont predate reunification. The expected  movements of history have been compressed unnaturally; its  a little like being in Calcutta during the Pujas, but on  a long-term basis, so that one might almost hope to become  inured (who knows?) to this intertwining of the fantastic  and the factual, this encounter with the banal, the historic,  the allegorical, the domestic, and the proximity between  them. It was a brilliant summer. It  took me by surprise: this natural affluence of daylight  in the midst of such palpable material affluence was difficult  to digest. I thought, blinking in the sun, of, at once,  those pre-war summers when Stephen Spender and company descended  on Berlin, to sunbathe with god-like blonde boys, and also  of the vanishing, in an instant, of sensual innocence, political  blindness, devastating pain, into the vacancy of this present-day,  new-millennial happiness. Bathed in light, I was there with  Spender, in the Thirties, as I could never have been if  I had lived then, and I was here, in post-unification, post-Schroeder,  post-Iraq Berlin. We stayed in a lovely flat in  Schoeneberg (beautiful hill, apparently, though there  was no hill in sight) with large windows and wooden floors,  and that most un-English of promontories, a balcony, spacious  enough for a dog, let alone humans, to be content in. There  was no dog; but my new friends children  a blonde sixteen-year-old  boy and a dark-haired nineteen-year-old girl  kept coming  in, going out. My friend and his wife no longer lived with  each other; they spoke to each other on the phone and shared  the children; they had become blood relations. His name  was Reinhold (Call me Reini), and he taught English at  the University of Magdeburg in the former East Germany,  where, in four days, I was to read out my stories. I went out and stood on the balcony  and surveyed the buildings opposite. I looked greedily;  more reticent but no less compelling than cathedrals and  temples, they wouldnt give up their secrets in a glance.  Schoeneberg, Reini said, had been a mixture of economic  classes and religions before the war; people of varying  income groups had lived here, and not a small number of  Jews. (I discovered later that the area used to be called  the Jewish Switzerland, and had a sizeable upper-middle  class Jewish population at the turn of the century.) Tagore  might have come here, he beamed. Why? Einstein lived here.  If they met in Berlin, it might have been here! The houses I saw from the balcony,  like the building I was in, had been erected in the Twenties;  they had miraculously survived the bombing. Thus, some of  the residential areas of Berlin, which escaped both the  bombs and the social levelling of East Berlin, have an extraordinarily  ambiguous inner weather. There are certain cities where  the houses in which people live and whose residential districts  are even more revelatory to the outsider than their monuments  and landmarks. Calcutta, Id say, is one, for a walk in  Mandeville Gardens or a drive through Bhowanipore or Alipore  is much more instructive and charged with excitement for  the visitor than a pilgrimage to the Victoria Memorial.  Berlin, I think, is another. Next morning (again, glorious),  Reini said hed take us  me, my wife, our daughter  for  a walk around Schoeneberg. On a plaque at the bottom of  the faade of a nearby block of flats, partly hidden by  the undergrowth, was the message that Einstein had resided  here. We crossed the main road, further rows of buildings,  and bridge. We came to the old town hall and the old  city centre. Before the wall fell, the Schoeneberg town  hall had been the town hall of West Berlin. Happy, indeed  secure, to be at the centre of an American colony, it displayed  lapidary words from John F. Kennedy addressed to West Germans.  At midday, the stentorian chimes of the freedom bell rang  out, as it had for fifty years, once a signal to benighted  East Berliners that liberty and democracy would one day  be theirs. Unlike the Iraqis, the West Germans, till recently,  were happy with their liberators (and had chosen to forget  their Russian ones); liberated not only from Nazism, but  the dreariness of socialism and enforced equality. On our way back our companion  pointed out signs that hung from posts on the pavement,  black German words on a white background. I recognized only  Juden as common to them all. These signs were meant to  remind you of the exact day when, say, Jews became barred  from taking PhDs. Another proclaimed the date when they  were deemed ineligible to become professional classical  musicians. Another recorded the day when Jews were denied  access to well-known areas of recreation. The dates ranged  from the late Twenties to the late Thirties: no one could  claim that they didnt know what was coming. Thinking of those signs, Im reminded  of Walter Benjamin and his essay Theses on the Philosophy  of History for two related reasons. The first is obvious;  Benjamins own history, his destiny and aborted career,  are inextricable from the history the signs narrate. Unable  to become a professor because of his religion, driven to  suicide by fear after the fall of Paris in 1939, it is only  after walking around Schoeneberg that I understand something  of the panic that fuelled his eloquence: The tradition  of the oppressed teaches us that the state of emergency  in which we live is not an exception but the rule; and,  The current amazement that the things we are experiencing  [that is, Fascism] are still possible in the twentieth  century is not philosophical. Part of Benjamins critique of  what he calls the empty, homogeneous time of (Western)  history  that is, Western history as a metaphor for history  itself  surely involves his violently endangered Jewish  identity. It was the inability of German liberals and opponents  of Fascism to imagine outside the paradigm of that empty,  homogeneous time, to imagine in what way Fascism might  be happening beyond and outside it, that helps bring Fascism,  in Benjamins eyes, into existence; and the same might be  said of many secular individuals and political parties in  India  the problem is not just the calculated connivance  with Fascism, but the inability to imagine it is really  present, to acknowledge that it is not an element in our  empty, homogeneous secular history with which we can quarrel  on our own terms. The other thing that struck me  gradually, as I looked at these signs  astonishing, estranging,  and puzzling  is the profound, as-yet unfathomed importance  of the Holocaust to European identity and self-consciousness.  This is something I hadnt quite grasped till I travelled  to Berlin. Obscene though it might be to say so, it seems  that the obsessive righteousness, memorialization, and remorse  surrounding the Holocaust  in Berlin, in Germany, but also  everywhere in Europe  suggests that it, too, has become  an all-important component of that empty, homogeneous time  without which history would be unimaginable (although it  is imaginable without many other traumas in the twentieth  century)  a development that Benjamin, naturally, didnt  live to see; nor can we know whether, as a once-divided  Zionist, he would have wanted to. The Holocaust cannot be  replicated or repeated; it has been universalized, almost  aestheticized, with the authority only Europe has, or has  had, to universalize and aestheticize. Both Jew and European  non-Jew are hurt and outraged if any equivalence is made,  say, between what is happening in Israel and Palestine and  what happened in Europe. The state of emergency in which  we live is not the exception but the rule, but, ironically,  this statement is doomed to be proven true only in retrospect. A SEQUEL TO THIS PIECE  WILL APPEAR NEXT SUNDAY

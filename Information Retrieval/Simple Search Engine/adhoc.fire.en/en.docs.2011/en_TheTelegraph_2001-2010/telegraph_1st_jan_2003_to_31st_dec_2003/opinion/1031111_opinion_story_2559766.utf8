		 Tuesday, November 11, 2003  THE FORCES OF PEACE
 - The American way of war has been absorbed by Israel  V.R. Raghavan The author is former director general  military operations, and currently director, Delhi Policy  Group  Contest of wills  Two processes are simultaneously  underway, currently, which throw light on the relationship  between military force and the society it is protecting.  American military power is visibly in use in Iraq since  the removal of the Saddam Hussein regime. The range of challenges  to be met in Iraq is a daunting one. It includes reconstruction,  constitutional, economic and societal tasks, which at the  best of times would need a few decades to fructify. Israel  is forcefully following a military option with a view to  securing its people against suicide attacks and to hastening  a resolution of the Palestinian issue. In neither of these  processes is there a worthwhile military opposition. Yet  in both processes, overwhelming military force is unable  to create conditions in which peace can prevail. The two  ongoing examples point towards the future of military force  as an instrument of policy in peace processes. On Iraq, the United States of  America has obtained a mandate of appro- val from the United  Nations for its military presence and that of its coalition  partners. Despite that, UN offices and agencies have become  targets of Iraqi terrorist attacks. These attacks have been  devastating enough to force UN offices to be vacated and  moved out of Iraq. The whole edifice of US attempts to rebuild  Iraq and its society is underwritten by the presence of  its troops and large aid programs. Notwithstanding this,  the US military presence is seen by Iraqis and in the Arab  world as one of forced and unwelcome occupation. It is seen  as a variant of imperial and colonial hegemony as also thr-  ough the prisms of a civilization conflict. The negative  spiral of more terrorist attacks followed by greater military  responses has already been set in motion. One would supplement  the other, and de-linking the two would become more difficult  by the week. Israel has been in the military  response mode since long against Palestinian suicide attacks.  It has attempted to defend its people from the trauma of  suicide attacks in public places, in which innocent civilians  bear the maximum costs and suffer the most. Ariel Sharons  government has used every means at its disposal to impose  costs on the Palestinian Authority. It has demonstrated  great intelligence and military competence in taking out  Hamas leaders responsible for terrorist attacks. It has  shut off power and water. It has closed employment avenues  at will. It has prevented Palestinians from working in the  olive farms. It has confined Yasser Arafat to a compound.  It has threatened regime change by planning to have him  removed from Palestine. Israels ability to take punitive  military action is unchallenged. There is also some justification  in an elected government having to take action in retaliation,  even if it is a poor substitute for policy. The fact, however,  remains that military attacks and other Israeli measures  harm the Palestinian people directly and extensively. They  are affected more than the Palestinian leaders. This fuels  hatred and sustains the rosters of volunteers for suicide  bombing. Israeli claims of having kill- ed those responsible  for terrorist acts are juxtaposed in the international media  with occasions of national sorrow and calls for revenge  at the Palestinian funerals. Pressures on the Israeli high  command of manning the front-line security in the face of  unending terror attacks in the tightly packed hinterland  has been immense. There have been intense internal debates  in the Israeli military of the counter-productive nature  of indiscriminate use of force against civilians. Military  leaders of democratic and liberal society states abhor indiscriminate  use of military force. Israel is no exception to this worthy  tradition, even if it has in the past used questionable  means to put down hostile groups. The realization of the diminishing  returns of using military force against civilians has recently  boiled over in Israel. The chief of staff of Israeli armed  forces, Lieutenant General Moshe Yaalon, went public with  his views that Israeli military tactics were threatening  its own interests. The crippling of lives of innocent Palestinians  through curfews, road-blocks and crackdowns are tactics  that operate against our own strategic interests. According  to the general, it increases hatred for Israel and strengthens  terrorist organizations. He was blunt in stating that the  war is taking place on the backs of civilians. One of  the most decorated fighter pilots in Israels history, Brigadier  General Yiftah Spector, recently signed a letter with two  dozen reserve pilots, to say that Israeli military policies  in Palestinian territories are against everything I was  raised on during his career in the air force. He was promptly  grounded as a flight instructor. It is not a coincidence that the  US and Israeli military operations are taking place in the  same region. The two states have for long believed in preponderant  military power as the means of obtaining security. The American  Way of War, a military theology which places a premium on  military victory with overwhelming force, had been absorbed  by Israeli leaders.  The war in Iraq to oust Saddam  Hussein was predicated on that assumption. Israeli emphasis  on decisive military victory was led in no small measure,  by its initial years of vulnerability to Arab threats. The  dramatic victories of the 1967 war and the ones which followed  were decisive military outcomes. Even in the Yom Kippur  war, Israeli generals wanted to destroy the Egyptian army  corps which had been cut off on the wrong side of the Suez  Canal. International pressures prevented that from happening.  It not only saved Arab pride but prepared the way for Camp  David. However, the sea- rch for decisive victory still  continues. What is unique is the shared strategic  belief in the role of military victory. A decisive military  victory is assured to the US and Israeli military in the  Arab region. But that does not ensure that peace can be  embedded after a humiliating military defeat. That the purpose  of war is not victory but peace, is a lesson often overlooked  in the pursuit of decisive military victories. Consequently,  military victories become the dominant discourse. This was  and still continues to be highlighted in the administrations  defence of events in Iraq. The Israeli situation is no different.  The response of the Sharon government to its chief of staffs  position on the conduct of military operations also aims  to highlight military efficiency rather than the political  dilemmas facing the country. The essential question which arises  is about the use of military power to find political solutions  to threats and conflicts. What post-Cold-War conflicts have  shown up is the reality of asymmetric wars being capable  of staving off capitulation in the face of overwhelming  military imbalance. As Colin Powell responded not long ago,  no amount of tanks and helicopter gun-ships will stop the  suicide-bomber. This reality has led to a substantive shift  in strategic balance. A conflict can be kept going indefinitely  by the weaker side, despite the military superiority of  the dominant power. It is no surprise that Israeli analysts  have been claiming that Yasser Arafats strategy is to perpetuate  the conflict rather than resolve it through negotiations. What we see, therefore, is the  contest of wills being waged through dissimilar means. One  side uses technology and superior weaponry while the other  uses low technology and high motivation to produce suicide-bombers  and other terrorist means. The negative impact on the minds  of people and society is becoming apparent in states with  preponderant military power. The impact on societies with  low levels of military capabilities is marked by religious  and civilizational fervour. International television coverage  and other information technology means also make it difficult  to influence public mood beyond a threshold. The end result  of this form of conflict with extended time zones and indeterminate  societal stamina is completely uncertain. When, in this volatile and uncertain  situation, the political needs of individual leaders and  parties get added, the uncertainty factor is further compounded.  In Israel, Sharon is facing daunting inquiries on financial  matters. In the US, George W. Bush will face increasing  pressure both on the handling of the intelligence and on  the consequences of war. The economy will also figure high  in the public mind. The link between economy and the uncertain  outcome in Iraq will not be long in coalescing. Political  leaderships facing challenges of political economy in the  midst of a military campaign have traditionally chosen to  reinforce the military option. The consequence of that in  Palestine and Iraq can only be of greater turbulence. The  two wars being waged simultaneously in west Asia will offer  important lessons in statecraft and military strategy.

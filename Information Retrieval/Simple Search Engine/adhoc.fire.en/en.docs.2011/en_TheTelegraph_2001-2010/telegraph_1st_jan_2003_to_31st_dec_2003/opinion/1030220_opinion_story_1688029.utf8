		 Thursday, February 20, 2003 				 RAW MATERIAL FOR ANTHRAX
 															- DOCUMENT Extracts from the first report on Iraq made by Hans Blix to the United Nations, January 27, 2003 To be concluded				 	 Hidden from them																								I would now like to turn to the so-called air force document... This document was originally found by an United Nations special commission inspector in a safe in the Iraqi air force headquarters in 1998... It gives an account of the expenditure of bombs, including chemical bombs by Iraq in the Iraq-Iran War. Im encouraged by the fact that Iraq has now provided this document to the UN monitoring, verification and inspection commission. The document indicates that 13,000 chemical bombs were dropped by the Iraqi air force between 1983 and 1998; while Iraq has declared that 19,500 bombs were consumed during this period. Thus, there is a discrepancy of 6,500 bombs. The amount of chemical agent in these bombs would be in the order of about 1,000 tons...We must assume that these quantities are now unaccounted for.																								The discovery of a number of 122-millimetre chemical rocket warheads in a bunker at the storage depot, 170 kilometres southwest of Baghdad, was much publicized. This was a relatively new bunker, and the rockets must have been moved here in the past few years at a time when Iraq should not have had such munitions. The investigation of these rockets is still proceeding.																								Iraq states that they were overlooked from 1991 from a batch of some 2,000 that were stored there during the Gulf War. This could be the case. They could also be the tip of a submerged iceberg. The discovery of a few rockets does not resolve, but rather points to the issue of several thousand of chemical rockets that are unaccounted for. The finding of the rockets shows that Iraq needs to make more effort to ensure that its declaration is currently accurate. During my recent discussions in Baghdad, Iraq declared that it would make new efforts in this regard and has set up a committee of investigation. Since then, it has reported that it has found four chemical rockets at a storage depot in al-Haji... I might further mention that inspectors have found at another site a laboratory quantity of thiodylykol... Iraq has declared that it had repaired chemical processing equipment previously destroyed under UNSCOM supervision and had installed it at Fallujah for the production of chlorine and phenols. We have inspected this equipment and are conducting a detailed technical evaluation of it. On completion, we will decide whether this and other equipment that has been recovered by Iraq should be destroyed. 																								I turn to biological weapons... Iraq has declared that it produced about 8,500 litres of this biological warfare agent, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991. Iraq has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction. There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared and that at least some of this was retained... It might still exist. Either it should be found and be destroyed under UNMOVIC supervision or else convincing evidence should be produced to show that it was indeed destroyed in 1991. As I reported to the council... Iraq did not declare a significant quantity, some 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media... As a part of its December 7, 2002, declaration Iraq resubmitted the Almarim panel document but the table showing this particular import of media was not included. The absence of this table would appear to be deliberate, as the pages of the resubmitted document were renumbered. In the letter of January 24 this year to the president of the security council, Iraqs foreign minister stated that, All imported quantities of growth media were declared. This is not evidenced. I note that the quantity of media involved would suffice to produce, for example, about 5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax. TO BE CONCLUDED

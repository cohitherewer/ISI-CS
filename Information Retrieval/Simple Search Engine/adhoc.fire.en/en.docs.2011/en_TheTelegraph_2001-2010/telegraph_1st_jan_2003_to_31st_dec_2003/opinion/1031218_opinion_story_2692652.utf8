 - Protecting farm income and stimulating industrial output  have a price  ABHIRUP SARKAR The author is professor of economics,  Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta  The dependence of industrial growth  on agriculture is solidly supported by facts. Over the last  seven years, whenever agriculture has failed to perform,  industrial growth has suffered, albeit with a lag. For example,  in 1995-96, industry grew at a fabulous rate of 13 per cent  but agricultural output exhibited negative growth. As a  result, industrial growth went down next year to 6.1 per  cent. This is not a case in isolation. The same pattern  can be observed in 1997-98, 1999-2000 and 2000-01. In each  of these years agricultural output either went down, compared  to the previous year, or remained almost stagnant. This  was invariably followed by a dip in industrial performance.  On the other hand, a decent agricultural  growth has always been followed by a lagged rise in industrial  growth. Thus good agricultural output in 1996-97, 1998-99  and 2001-02 has been followed by a spurt in industrial expansion  in 1997-98, 1999-00 and 2002-03 respectively.  In short, though the extent of  association between the two growth rates varied from year  to year, as is expected, because agriculture is not the  only determinant of industrial growth, the empirical connection  between the two is just too evident. Such clear statistical  regularity can hardly be a coincidence. It must indicate  a causal relationship. It must also mean that part of the  fluctuations in industrial output is due to fluctuations  in agricultural output, which in turn can be attributed  to the fancy of the monsoon. This is well recognized in  the official literature as well. So much so that each year  the economic survey of the government of India devotes a  whole section to the nature and extent of the current monsoon.  How does agriculture affect industry? Agriculture, so far as textbook  economics goes, helps the industrial sector essentially  in two different ways. First, it supplies inputs to be used  in the industrial sector and second, it provides a market  for industrial goods. With the importance of traditional  agro-based industries gradually going down, we shall ignore  the role of agriculture as a supplier of inputs and focus  only on the second aspect of the agriculture-industry relationship.  How does agriculture work as an outlet for industrial goods?  The standard argument is that higher output in the agricultural  sector translates into higher agricultural income, which,  in turn, creates higher demand for industrial goods. The  argument sounds apparently reasonable, but does not stand  a closer scrutiny. The trouble is, there is no guarantee  that agricultural income would rise if there is an increase  in agricultural output. The reason is straightforward. A  rise in output leads to a fall in the price and so the revenue  or income of the farmers, which is the product of the price  and the quantity sold, may either go up or down.  In fact, demand for agricultural  goods is pretty inelastic, that is, a fall in price leads  to a relatively small increase in demand. So to make the  market absorb the increased output, a large fall in the  price is necessary. A large fall in the price, in turn,  implies a fall in the income of the farmers. In other words,  a rise in agricultural output is likely to reduce farm income  instead of increasing it. Indeed, we do hear about farmers  complaining about over-production and low prices because  of too much supply in the market. There is, however, an indirect  channel through which an expansion in agricultural output  may raise industrial demand. Given that demand for agricultural  goods, especially that for foodgrains, is inelastic, a rise  in output and a consequent fall in price lead to a fall  in the total revenue of the farmers. But this means that  consumers outside the agricultural sector are spending less  on agricultural goods. So they must be spending more on  industrial goods. This, in turn, should raise industrial  demand. This rise in demand, however, has to be weighed  against the fall in demand coming from the agricultural  sector. Demand coming from the agricultural sector should  fall because farm income is falling due to a fall in farm  price. The net effect on industrial demand may still be  positive, but the magnitude is not likely to be big, surely  not as big as is needed to explain the strong relationship  between agriculture and industry. The right explanation, in our  opinion, can be provided in terms of minimum support prices  for major agricultural products and the subsequent government  procurement. It is well known that before the harvest, the  government typically announces a price for each important  crop and after the harvest it procures the crop at the pre-announced  price. Initially, the main objective of the government was  to procure foodgrains for the public distribution system.  But over the past few years, the importance of the public  distribution system seems to be on the decline. Indeed,  dismantling the public distribution system is now thought  to be not only appropriate but almost necessary as a part  of the more general scheme of market-oriented reforms. But  this does not mean that procurement is on the decline. On  the contrary, procurement of foodgrains as a percentage  of output has steadily increased over the past few years,  especially since the Bharatiya Janata Party has taken charge.  Just for the record, procurement  of rice and wheat as a percentage of total output has increased  from 15 per cent in 1998-99 to 25 per cent in 2001-02. On  the other hand, offtake of foodgrains through the standard  distribution channels like ration shops has not significantly  increased and in some years has actually fallen. The two,  taken together, has led to a steady rise in public holding  of food stocks. Clearly, the objective of the  government has changed. The emphasis has shifted away from  public distribution of food to the poor consumers towards  providing price support to rich farmers. Clearly, procurement  of stocks in a year of bumper harvest prevents the market  price from crashing and this artificial price is maintained  over time because the procured stocks are sparingly offloaded  to the market. The whole exercise, it goes without saying,  protects farm income and is undertaken especially to insulate  rich farmers from the ups and downs of the market. Undoubtedly,  small farmers who are big enough to sell to the market are  also gaining in the process. Finally, as a result of the  procurement exercise, farm income is unambiguously going  up in a year of good harvest leading to increased demand  for industrial goods and a lagged increase in industrial  growth. Should we complain? After all,  industrial growth and protection of farm income are both  desirable outcomes. But the trouble is that these outcomes  are not reached costlessly. A huge amount of public money  is spent on procurement of stocks which are never made available  to the consumer. This money could have been spent on productive  public investment, which would have enhanced the future  growth potential of the industrial sector. It would have  boosted private investment as well. Moreover, stimulating  industrial demand through a good harvest exposes the industrial  sector to the whims of the monsoon god. This, in turn, leads  to undesirable cycles.

 NARESH KUMAR																								Certain images stay embedded in ones memory. As a child reading a volume of the Book of Knowledge, there was a picture of an immaculately clad captain in uniform standing ramrod straight, hand raised in salute, going down with his ship. In the background, one could see rowboats crowded with survivors. More than 60 years have passed, but I can still see it vividly. The photograph epitomized the qualities of a great captain  dignity, pride, courage, leadership and the burden of total responsibility, to the extent of giving up ones life. 																								In modern sport at the international level, where victory or defeat is projected globally to millions and the pride of a nation is at stake, a captains role is a crushing burden. Victory can bring glory, pride, respect and prosperity for the whole nation! The captain becomes the face of the nation. The teams attitude and body language filters through to the millions watching and affects the morale of the entire country. There is no place to hide. Every nuance is probed, recorded and played back a thousand times. 																								Englands recent victory in the Rugby World Cup has restored national pride, self-confidence and stimulated the economy by millions of pounds. The stakes are sky-high. A poor captain can prove to be a national disaster while a great captain can inspire a ragtag team to Olympian heights.  New generation boys																								The job of the captain of an Indian team is more difficult than that of others. To weld together a great diversity of cultures, attitudes, regional habits, religious beliefs is a challenging task, to put it mildly. Australia, Britain, Sri Lanka, West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand and Pakistan do not have to contend with this. In India, the captain has to tackle big money and fame from a relatively young age and not let the rivalry for sponsorships with the other leading players cloud his judgment. Personal relationships have to be vaulted over in selecting the team. There are many other pressures to tackle. So, an Indian cricket captain has to be a very special human being.																								Another image that lurks in my memory and which shattered sporting norms at the most hallowed of cricket grounds was of Sourav Ganguly, with a bare torso, twirling his shirt like a cowboys lasso on the balcony of Lords after defeating England in the NatWest trophy. It signaled the emergence of a new generation, with scant respect for old traditions. This is a worldwide phenomenon, which has swept aside magnanimity at the moment of triumph.  One more great																								The liberation from past norms has triggered a new positive attitude in our team. To communicate and inspire the current generation this is required. Quiet steely resolve is fading fast, and is at times misconstrued as weakness. Can you imagine Leander Paes shorn of fist pumping and chest bumping? Happily, Sourav Ganguly seems to be well on his way to being a great captain. His aggression, reined in, but still there, has given him maturity so necessary in the top echelons of the game. Our victory against Australia, which early in the match looked all set to be yet another gutless washout, has acted as the morale-booster for the whole nation.																								Talking of great captains, one cannot ignore the sterling credentials of Steve Waugh. He brought discipline and focus to a bunch of raucous beer-swilling, fun-loving youngsters and made them the best team in the world. When things went wrong, Waugh stepped into the breach and invariably stemmed the rot. In addition to his great qualities as a captain, he projected quietly, not trumpeted, his concern and support for the poor and needy. It was recently reported that he was donating 30 per cent of his earnings to charity. A fine human being, he has moved up from being a living legend to an icon in the cricketing world.																								The Australian refrain of chin music has lost its rhythm while India has to prove that this was not just one swallow in the Australian summer. For Indian cricket, the current series could well be the moment of truth.

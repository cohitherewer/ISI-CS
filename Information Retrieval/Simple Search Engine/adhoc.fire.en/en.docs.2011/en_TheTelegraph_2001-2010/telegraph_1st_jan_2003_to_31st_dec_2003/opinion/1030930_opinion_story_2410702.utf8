		 Tuesday, September 30, 2003  NOW THAT ALL IS SAID AND DONE
 Achin Vanaik argues that  no one was more effective in arguing for the Palestinian  cause nor more accurate in his criticism of US and Israeli  iniquities than Edward Said  The author is a political scientist  and has recently published the book, Communalism Contested:  Religion, Modernity and Secularization To make history  happen  In the Indian media, Edward Saids  demise has brought forth deserved encomiums for a remarkable  Renaissance-like personality of multiple talents who was  also one of the worlds outstanding public intellectuals,  never afraid of speaking the truth and exposing the lies,  deceits and hypocrisies of the powerful and their hangers-on.  Of course, given the times we live in, we can fully expect  some pro-Hindutva and pro-Zionist voices to express  their veiled or not-so-veiled contempt for Said.  This article will not aim to add  to the encomiums that have already covered all facets of  Saids life. I will only seek to elucidate Edward Saids  vision of the Palestinian struggle, its goal, its strategy,  its prospects. He was, without doubt, the single most important  spokesperson (outside of the formal political leadership)  for the Palestinian cause. No one was more effective in  expounding the justice of this struggle nor anyone more  accurate and penetrating in their criticism of the iniquitous  behaviour of the United States of America and Israeli governments  towards Palestinians and their attempts (abetted by house  intellectuals and a largely supine Western media) to cover  this up.  The loss from Saids death is  simply inestimable. From the Seventies, his tireless efforts  in print, speech or through television appearances and documentary-making  made him such a pre-eminent public pedagogue and spokesperson.  After 1994, he had the courage (virtually alone at the beginning)  to stand up and oppose the Oslo and then the Wye Accords  and to expose them for what they always were  a sham and  a disgrace to any genuine process of seeking a truly just  and fair peace settlement. The Indian government, the overwhelming  majority of Indian media commentators, and almost the whole  of the strategic establishment still wish for the Palestinian  issue to somehow go away. Any peace settlement, as long  as it lasts, is good enough. Hence the earlier refrain about  the unfortunate collapse of the Oslo accords and todays  constant clamour about salvaging the utterly fraudulent  US-backed roadmap to peace. Said did more than simply demolish  the case for the accords through his systematic and detailed  analysis of their deceitful terms and extraordinarily limited  concessions, and his descriptions of what the everyday brutal  reality of occupation during the peace process meant to  ordinary Palestinians. He also highlighted the disastrous  strategic-political mistake made by Yasser Arafat in deciding  that after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Kuwait  War, the only chance of getting a reasonably fair two-state  settlement was by relying on the US to play the role of  an honest broker willing to persuade the Israeli government  to accept this final solution.  Instead, as Said was the first  to point out, this farcical peace process, controlled  by a US government that was never interested in playing  fair, was meant to impose a final Bantustan-type solution.  That is to say, effectively allowing substantial and formally  sanctified usurpation by Israel of a great part of even  the occupied territories, as well as ensuring through such  a final settlement the permanently institutionalized military,  strategic, economic and political subordination of Palestine  (limited sovereignty dressed up as independent statehood)  to Israel. Arafat cannot bring himself to acknowledge his  fatal strategic mistake. Hence his continued attempts to  restore the peace process with US help. Arafat could also  never bring himself to fully betray the Palestinian cause  when he realized that the only settlement on offer would  have meant precisely this. That is why today, both the US  and Israel have turned against him and sought an even more  pliant Palestinian leadership. While Tel Aviv discusses  whether it should assassinate Arafat, Washington asks it  to avoid such talk publicly and merely vilifies Arafat. Said not only criticized Arafat  (while always respecting his earlier historic role as leader  or symbol of Palestinians), he provided his own distinctive  strategic vision. His own long-term goal had shifted from  advocating the two-state solution to that of a bi-national  unified territorial state with full and equal rights for  both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs  the end of Zionism  rather than co-existence with it. What was more important  was Saids prescription for how either of these two goals  could be achieved. To those who argued in the name of a  so-called realism that the only alternative available was  abandoning the search for either a two-state or bi-national  type, and accepting a Bantustan in all but name, he presented  a firm no. The final goal of a just peace must never be  compromised upon, though the means to achieving it could  certainly involve compromises. Behind this insistence lay a deep  understanding of the real meaning of political struggle  far removed from the understandings of most strategic experts  for whom politics is, above all, statecraft that must obey  the golden rule of respecting the existing relationship  of forces between various contenders. For Said, political  struggle was ultimately a clash of wills not of arms or  of economic strength in which one side seeks to impose its  will on the other. If Palestinians retained the will to  insist on a just peace then, in the long run, Israel (and  the US) could be politically defeated as the experiences  of Vietnam and the end of apartheid in South Africa showed. What was required then was a different  political-strategic perspective that no longer relied on  either Israeli or US good intentions or behaviour but prioritized  the building of a new, much more democratic and non-corrupt  Palestinian leadership, not the mafia led by Arafat and  others. To be truly democratic, such a leadership would  have to establish political structures giving voice to representatives  of the four million strong Palestinian diaspora outside  the occupied territories. Second, it would have to give  up the morally untenable and strategically counter-productive  path of attacking Israeli civilians and even military confrontation,  though the Israeli government would certainly continue with  its institutionalized brutality, murder and violence against  ordinary Palestinians since that was the only way to sustain  its occupation. Three, while engagement with the US, Israeli,  European and other governments was tactically necessarily,  strategically the focus had to be on engaging, in a much  more determined and sophisticated manner, the broader public  in civil societies everywhere, but especially in the US,  by playing the Palestinians greatest trump card. This has  always been the moral strength and integrity of their case  against the dishonest and increasingly threadbare pretence  of Zionism that Israelis, not Palestinians, are the real  victims.  Finally, this leaderships main  focus has to be on sustaining the morale and determination  of Palestinians to continue resisting non-violently (and  all the more effective for being peaceful) by building precisely  those links that promote grassroots democracy, welfare and  development for ordinary Palestinians everywhere. The greatest tribute to Edward  Said would be to recognize his wisdom by endorsing his concentration  on the development of the internal moral-political resources  of the Palestinians and simultaneously expanding international  solidarity with Palestinians as the best way to change decisively  the overall relationship of forces in their favour. For  theirs is the last and longest running anti-colonial struggle  of modern history. History is not on the side of the US  and Israel. By internalizing this profound insight, the  Palestinian leadership can be strongly optimistic of making  history happen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, December 28, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																West knows least				 																																																				Sir  Karan Johar was obviously feigning modesty when he said he had no idea why the Margaret Herrick library chose to include the script of his film, Kal Ho Naa Ho, in its collection  but he was closer to the truth than he realized (Kal Ho in Oscar hall of script, Dec 26). Indeed, someone should educate the Westerners in the range and scope of Indian films  not because we crave Western approval, but because god forbid anybody should think Kal Ho is all there is to Indian films. Set aside greats like Satyajit Ray, even Bollywood has better stuff than the soppy mindlessness Johar has to offer.

				 																Domestic hero				 																																																				Sir  K.P. Nayar contends that the Republicans in the United States of America are in retreat (Bushs sinking ship, Dec 10). But the evidence hardly supports the assertion. Conservative talk-show hosts show little sign of being on the defensive. They continue to defend George W. Bush on Iraq, tax cuts, homosexual marriage, with unmitigated fervour. They see Americas increasing isolation in the world as an unalloyed triumph  no more kowtowing to the United Nations. Colin Powells efforts to garner international support over Iraq are regarded with pity. Their real hero is Donald Rumsfeld who has little patience for forging coalitions and partnerships. Even the daily news of the killing of US soldiers in Iraq fails to temper the truculence of the conservatives. 				 																																																				Nayars more significant omission is the US economy which, in the last few months, has strengthened unmistakably. The trade and budget deficits continue to climb  but what matters is economic growth, rising income, falling unemployment. On these fronts, the economy is doing well and Bush and his fellow Republicans are taking full credit for it. Far from retreating, the conservatives are on the warpath  literally and figuratively. If the economic recovery turns out to be robust and Iraq remains reasonably manageable, the Democrats will find it difficult to eject Bush from the White House next November.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sanjay Paul, Pennsylvania, US

				 																																																				Sir  The credibility of the Bush administration is fast eroding. The US media is shedding its uncritical attitude towards the Bush cabal. As suffering mounts in Iraq despite Saddam Husseins capture, the Bush administration is sinking deeper into a moral abyss. Economically, the situation is grim too. Troubles on the diplomatic front indicate that difficulties lie ahead for the Bush administration, which has never been so isolated internationally as it is now. The US is finding hard to get friends to share its burden in Iraq. The global community is unlikely to allow the Americans to easily extricate themselves from Iraq, leaving behind the humanitarian and political problems they have created. Noam Chomsky, a respected intellectual, writes in one of his articles that violence is a powerful instrument of control and the dilemmas of dominance are not slight. I think the Bush administration is facing such a dilemma. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																One step forward				 																																																				Sir  Instead of deciding to impose a ban on advertisements of tobacco-products, why did not the Union cabinet take the ultimate step of totally banning the sale of tobacco-products, especially cigarettes, which is responsible for killing millions of people every year? The government spends much more on treatment of tobacco-related diseases than it earns from the sale of such products. The government should also ban the manufacture of cigarettes and tobacco-products like gutkha, defying pressure from the influential tobacco-lobby in the country!				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhash Agrawal, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The government must ban cigarette shops near schools and colleges as children think smoking is fashionable. Tobacco companies also must be banned from sponsoring cricket matches and bring production to a close in a few years. Also, there is need to create awareness in villages. Lottery and liquor advertisements must also be banned, as these too increase poverty.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Knowledge is bliss				 																																																				 Sir  A Hollywood hunk speaking cerebrally is no mean feat, considering the average standard of American intelligence and their preference for brawn over brains. Ben Afflecks diatribe against the ignorance of his countrymen stands out in Americas scheme of cultural imperialism, Hollywood-style (Affleck rues Americas ignorance, Dec 25). Commercial American cinema has shamelessly distorted facts, and often history, to glorify some of the countrys darkest epochs and failures  Vietnam, Afghanistan, Korea and the Kennedy assassination. It has generated numerous social ills  violence, xenophobia and blatant consumerism  which have played havoc in many developing societies. Sadly, Affleck needs to do much more than pay lip service to the west Asian cause. He could mobilize like-minded artistes to protest against the constant Russian-Chinese-Muslim bashing dished out by Hollywood. Perhaps, he can take a leaf out of West Bengals own way of protest by striking work and forcing the movie industry to sit up and take note of the issue.

				 																Inside view				 																																																				Sir  While the headline of the editorial, False flag (Dec 18), appropriately reflects the discomfiture of the Congress after losing the assembly elections in the Hindi heartland, the contents portray a distorted view on the whys and wherefores of the debacle. The oft-repeated saffron agenda of Hindutva or the so called soft Hindutva of the Congress, are spectres which are entirely media-created. So is the term saffronization. It has been commented that Sonia Gandhis appeal to defend secularism sounds hollow because she started her election campaign in Gujarat in a temple earlier in the year. But what about the fact that she hosts iftar parties every year?				 																																																				One cannot deny the fact that the grand old party of India, the Congress, has fallen from grace. Its vote bank has shrunk beyond imagination. Caught between Nehruvian economics and the demands of liberalization, privatization and globalization, it is confused. Lack of direction and pragmatic leadership and negative agenda have further isolated the party. All this while, the Gandhi tag and the party flag, which is similar to the tricolour, had favoured the party. Not so any more. There may still be some time left for the decadent Congress to mend its ways. If it does not do some serious introspection, it will be wiped out in the next elections. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R.N. Sharma, Sibsagar, Assam

				 																																																				Sir  Why is Bharat Bhushan so pained by the Congress debacle when Congressmen themselves do not seem to be bothered (The end of the line, Dec 11)? In-depth analysis of the kind journalists sometimes do are almost never conducted within the party itself, where muscle and money power and sycophancy are important. As Bhushan correctly observes, nobody in the party might have the courage to tell Sonia Gandhi that she does not present the winning face of the Congress. It is a pity that a 119-year old political party is headed by someone like her. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

				 																																																				Sir  At a recent function at the Aligarh Muslim University, the miffed Congress leader, Sonia Gandhi, called upon all secular parties to join hands against the Bharatiya Janata Party (Stung Sonia shoots secular salvo, Dec 14). The reversion to secularism comes close after the partys humiliating defeat in the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Sonia Gandhi may have declared war against all kinds of communalism, but it has to be noted how carefully she has chosen her venue to launch her attack against her opponent party. Her speech and observations might be fomenting communal problems already. While it may be true that Sonia Gandhi is stung by her defeat, she should realize that it was the decision of the electorate which no longer gets swayed by her dynasty. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
G.B. Srikanth, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhis intense dislike for communalism of any kind may be genuine but her efforts to fight it are half-hearted. This truth has been exposed time and again. The political leader in Aligarh who observed that Sonia Gandhi ought to convert her fiery speeches against communalism into concrete action hit the nail right on its head.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arpita Moitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  For the Congress, ideological abstractions have given way to more realistic targets and achievements. Ideologies like secularism and Hindutva are mere abstractions which are not always comprehensible to the average Indian. The general voter in India is not very different from a child. A clear and concrete agenda works more efficiently with them than the ambiguities of ideology. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

				 																																																				Sir  The Congresss confidence has been seriously undermined by the assembly elections. Otherwise, on its 119th anniversary, it would not have taken a U-turn from its earlier Panchmarhi agenda (Sonia gives up pole position to woo allies, Dec 29). However, Sonia Gandhis attempt to leave the partys choice of the prime ministerial candidate open is another effort to dupe the people of this country. If the Congress manages a sizeable position in the next elections, she is bound to claim the prime ministers post. Sonia Gandhi will then argue that the electorate has chosen her party, and therefore her, to rule and thus their verdict on the matter of her foreign origin is clear. As matters stand now, unless the 119-year-old party retires from politics, voters will be compelled to do so.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhis announcement that the Congress will not impose any pre-conditions for a poll alliance may further weaken the base of the party. The only way the Congress can re-establish its dominant position is by projecting some uncontroversial Congressman of Indian origin as its prime ministerial candidate. For even if the Congress led-alliance wins, there may be fresh dissidence within the party over Sonia Gandhis foreign origin. If Sonia Gandhi retracts from her current position, there is a chance former Congressmen may return to its fold. Meanwhile, she can continue to be the party chief.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  This is a do-or-die situation for the Congress. Sonia Gandhi should remember that her candidacy as a future prime minister will continue to discourage possible allies. The only way she can retrieve the situation and retain the crown is by bringing Priyanka Gandhi into politics.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
J. Haldar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sonia Gandhis recent announcement seems to be an open invitation to Sharad Pawar to play his hand in the power game. But remember Sonia, Mulayam Singh Yadav is also a keen contender.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, S. Srinivas, Calcutta

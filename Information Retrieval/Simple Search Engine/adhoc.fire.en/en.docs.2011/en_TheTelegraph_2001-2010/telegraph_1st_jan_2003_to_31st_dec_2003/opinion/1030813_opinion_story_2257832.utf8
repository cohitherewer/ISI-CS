		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 FREE THE COW
																								In India anything from caste to cows can become an issue to be exploited as electoral assets. There is no other explanation for the sudden cabinet decision to promulgate a bill to ban cow slaughter. The motives are underlined by the rush to move the bill in this session of Parliament. It would suit secular fundamentalists to put the blame for all this on the door of the Bharatiya Janata Party. It is true that the sangh parivar has, since its birth, carried on a campaign to protect the cow, which it thinks is sacred to Hindus. In that sense, it can be said that the BJP is merely going by a long established agenda. The matter, however, is not that simple. The Congress has not hesitated to cling to the cow in its quest for votes. In Madhya Pradesh, the chief minister, Mr Digvijay Singh, has made the cow the state animal and has begun a campaign to prevent it from being slaughtered. In the race to win Hindu votes, both the BJP and the Congress are equally eager to play the cow card. This might be par for the course for the BJP but there must be some Congressmen at least who are dismayed by Mr Singhs variety of populism. In the pursuit of the majority votes, other sections of the population who prefer to eat beef, often because it is the cheapest meat available, will be further marginalized. The proposal to ban cow slaughter, from whichever quarter it comes, can only be seen as a partisan religious argument. A ban on cow slaughter invokes state power to promote the alleged religious sentiments of one community.																								In a democracy, any argument to ban something to pander to a religious community stands on very dubious intellectual ground. It privileges the opinions and practices of one community over those of other communities. If for reasons specific to Hindus, cow slaughter is banned, then Muslims have the right to preserve their own practices and reject the common civil code. The campaign to ban the killing of cows is premised on the utterly mistaken belief that India is a Hindu country. India is not a Hindu country in demographic terms. Nor is it a Hindu country in terms of the Constitution which lies at the very heart of the Indian republic. It is one thing to campaign for the protection of the cow and quite another to use state power to ban cow slaughter. No less a worshipper of the cow than Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi once said that there is no service or protection of the cow in trying to save her by force. To seek intellectual premises of the present proposal is to dignify it. It is an act of graceless electioneering which can only be deplored.

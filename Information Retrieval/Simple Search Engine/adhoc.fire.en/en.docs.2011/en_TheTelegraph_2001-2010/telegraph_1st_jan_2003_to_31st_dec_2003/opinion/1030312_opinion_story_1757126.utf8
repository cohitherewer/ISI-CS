		 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF SPORT
 															- DOCUMENT Extracts from the anti-doping code adopted  by more than 80 countries at the World Conference on Doping  in Sports in Copenhagen, March 3-5				 	 Sergei Bubka addressing the conference																								The purpose of the World Anti-Doping Programme and the World Anti-Doping Code are: to protect the athletes fundamental right to participate in doping-free sport and thus ensure fairness and equality for athletes worldwide and to ensure harmonized and effective anti-doping programmes at the international and national level with regard to detection, deterrence and prevention of doping.																								The World Anti-Doping Programme encompasses all of the elements needed in order to ensure optimal harmonization and best practice in national and international anti-doping programmes. The code is the fundamental and universal document upon which the programme is based. The purpose of the code is to advance the anti-doping effort through universal harmonization of core anti-doping elements. It is intended to be specific enough to achieve complete harmonization on issues where uniformity is required, yet general enough in other areas to permit flexibility on how agreed upon anti-doping principles are implemented.																								International standards for different technical and operational areas within the anti-doping programme will be developed in consultation with the signatories and governments and approved from time to time by World Anti-Doping Agency. The purpose of these standards is harmonization among anti-doping organizations responsible for specific technical and operational parts of the anti-doping programmes. The standards are mandatory for all signatories to the code.																								Models of best practice based on the code will be developed to provide state-of-the-art solutions in different areas of anti-doping. The models will be recommended by WADA but will not be mandatory. In addition to providing models of anti-doping documentation, WADA will also make some training assistance available to the signatories.																								The fundamental rationale for the world anti-doping code: anti-doping programmes seek to preserve what is intrinsically valuable about sport. This intrinsic value is often referred to as the spirit of sport, it is the essence of Olympism; it is how we play true. The spirit of sport is the celebration of the human spirit, body and mind, and is characterized by the following values:																								Fair play and honesty; excellence in performance; character and education; fun and joy; teamwork; dedication and commitment; health; respect; courage; community and solidarity. Doping is fundamentally contrary to Olympism, health and the spirit of sport...																								Doping is the involvement of prohibited drugs or methods in sport to enhance performance. Doping includes the use, or the presence in an athletes bodily specimen, of any prohibited substance or prohibited method...[having] the potential to enhance performance and pose a risk of harm to athletes or are otherwise contrary to the spirit of sport. Substances that mask the use of other prohibited substances or methods are also prohibited. Violations of other anti-doping rules are also considered doping. TO BE CONCLUDED

 							 - A toff parading as a tramp Dayita Datta				 	 Explaining Orwell																								Orwell: The Life By D.J. Taylor, Chatto and Windus,  20																								Before he died, Orwell had requested that no biography of him should be written, an injunction that was broken only a few years after his death. Perhaps to forestall further distortions, his widow, Sonia, who took her duties as the keeper of the flame seriously, but was a capricious and difficult woman, commissioned Bernard Crick, professor of political science at London University, to write an authorized life  only to disagree violently with what in some ways was a scrupulous work.																								With Orwells centenary, it was inevitable that his literary corpse would be dissected yet again. D.J. Taylor belongs to a generation born a decade after Orwells death in 1950. He admits, in his introduction, to having come ac- ross Orwells novel, A Clergymans Daughter, as a schoolboy, and Orwell has obsessed me for the better part of a quarter of a century. (This reviewer, who came across Orwell at about the same age and in similar circumstances, and who has read and reread his books and essays many times, can understand this extraordinary power of Orwell to provoke and inspire.) Almost as if Taylor declares himself the final authority, his book has the subtitle, The Life.																								Taylor is a fine writer, with a clarity of style that Orwell  the sworn enemy of verbosity and pretentiousness  would have approved of. He has diligently trawled through the usual sources, and interviewed many people who knew Orwell (a steadily diminishing tribe). Practically anyone who knew Orwell has left some recollection of him, and the picture that emerges is somewhat different from the secular saint mythology which has built up in the fifty years since his death.																								Yet after all that research, it is difficult to say if he has anything really new to say about his subject, beyond what Crick has already uncovered. Nor can he satisfactorily explain why Orwell is still relevant in our post-Cold-War world. All that he can come up with is a pathetic incident involving the father of a college friend, who once had a confrontation with Orwell (then Eric Blair), over a girl, in his years of obscurity. This adds hardly anything new to the picture of Orwell  whose diffidence and awkwardness with women are well known. This is a pity because the contours of Orwells life  from Eric Blair, the former Burma policeman, to George Orwell, the writer and left-wing political activist  although well known, could do with a fresh interpretation.																								For those who have not read the Crick biography, Taylors book is a thoroughly researched effort. He chooses to begin with an account of Orwells interment at an Oxfordshire churchyard  one of the many ironies of his life was that this lifelong atheist had stipulated that he should be buried with the rites of the Church of England. This links up with the opening sentence of his first chapter: Like most rebels, his friend Anthony Powell maintained, Orwell was half in love with the thing he was rebelling against. This is the theme of the entire work: the contradictions that underlay the man and the writer.																								Taylor is good on Orwells family origins: the son of a minor colonial official belonging to (Orwells words) the lower-upper-middle class, with memories of past prosperity. This family baggage he would carry well into his adult life. All his life, Orwell would be conscious of belonging to the gentry  during his down and out days tramping in the company of vagrants and petty criminals, he was recognized for what he was: a toff parading as a tramp. Even in Spain, where he fought with the most left-wing militia, the POUM, his comrade Jack Edwards noticed that for all his sympathy with the cause of the working class, he was not a mixer in the accepted sense. During calm periods, he would brew specially-sent-out English tea and read Victorian novels.																								Taylor also thoroughly explores the writing of Animal Farm and 1984. He explains the difficulties Orwell faced in getting them published, and the misunderstandings which attended them, from left and right. In this context, he mentions Sidney Sheldon  in the Forties a scriptwriter in Hollywood  who made an unsuccessful attempt to adapt 1984 for the stage. Apparently, he had wanted to give it an anti-Fascist slant, fully supported by Orwell. This was against the prevailing tendency in the US to see it as an anti-Soviet warning. It might have been better if Taylor could have let us know more about this correspondence between them. No greater contrast can be imagined than Orwells spare limpid prose and political concerns, and Sheldons overblown style, suited to the Hollywood-style bodice-rippers, which eventually made him a rich man. To compensate for his lack of any original insights, Taylor interrupts his narrative with a series of brief meditations about Orwells face, his voice and even his anti-Semitism and phobia about rats (which found its terrifying climax in 1984). It is true that there seems to be a startling degeneration between the rather chubby young man and the ravaged features of the last years. The change cannot be attributed solely to the tuberculosis which killed him just past his 46th birthday. As for his phobia about rats, anyone who has read his books will be aware of this; his anti-Semitism is characteristic of his class (Taylor feels he would have admitted it). Possibly for a reader, new to both the life and the work, they may add to the picture.																								Perhaps the strangest aspect of this book is Taylors long disquisition, The Case Against, where he plays devils advocate by hurling all the criticisms which a doctrinaire Marxist critic might hurl at Orwell. It is difficult to know what to make of this. Is Taylor deliberately using the clichs of this tribe to illuminate Orwells clarity of style and outlook against all forms of totalitarianism? Or is it just another gimmick to cover up his lack of anything new to say?																								Perhaps the strangest thing about Orwells life was his deathbed marriage to the beautiful Sonia Brownell. Taylor can understand Orwells motives, but finally gives up on trying to understand Sonias reasons for this strange pact (later in life she would say that she simply felt sorry for him). Ironically, the only new insight comes from the Epilogue, And Sonia, a short account of her subsequent career. Taylor tries hard not to fall into the camp of those who thought of her as a heartless gold-digger (he has obviously read Hilary Spurlings rehabilitation of her friend), but it is difficult not to conclude that Orwells affairs were left to an unstable and impulsive woman.																								In the end, one is left with the feeling that for all his hard work and assiduous research, Taylor has only recycled the picture painted by Crick: the man who despised the class into which he was born, who still retained a trace of upper-class hauteur, who celebrated simple pleasures, yet was one of the first to appreciate James Joyce and Henry Miller, who came slowly to socialism, but detested Stalinists. Despite his human failings, Orwell remains the author of some of the most celebrated essays in the English language, and two novels, generally acknowledged among the greatest masterpieces of the 20th century. It is not difficult to agree with Orwells friend, Richard Rees, whose words serve as an epigraph for Taylor: Obviously, no full explanation of a man is ever possible.						DAYITA DATTA

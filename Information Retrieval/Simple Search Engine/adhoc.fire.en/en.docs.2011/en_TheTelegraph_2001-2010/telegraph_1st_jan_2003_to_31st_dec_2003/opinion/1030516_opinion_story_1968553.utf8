		 Friday, May 16, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Happiness, hoaxes and a maharaniThe Museum of Hoaxes (Penguin,  Rs 275) by Alex Boese is a very readable compendium  of human deception: To become a hoax, a lie must have something  extra. It must be somehow outrageous, ingenious, dramatic,  or sensational. Most of all, it must command the attention  of the public. Boeses collection is arranged chronologically,  starting with the Middle Ages and bringing the book right  up to the internet era: the Internet has become the great  incubator of every lie, rumour, and half-baked idea imaginable.  This is a bizarre and diverting book, wearing its considerable  learning lightly, but there is a strain of seriousness running  through it, exploring the question of why people deceive  and like to be deceived. From Mandevilles anthropophagi  and the Feejee mermaid to bonsai kittens and malepregnancy.com,  the story of human ingenuity and credulity never fails to  fascinate and sometimes horrify. The Zero Heart Attack Path  (Penguin, Rs 200) by Rekha Shetty is inspired  by a health-plan born out of an encounter between an American  physician and an Indian sanyasi. There is no medical  jargon in this book, but a lot of solemn discussion on happiness-quotients,  well-being strategies and the Soul: Support your spouse,  Be unique, Avoid toxic people, Play with babies and make  them giggle, Plant seeds and trees and distribute them to  people you now, and so on. Then there are calming exercises  and wholesome recipes.Maharani: Memoirs of a Rebellious  Princess (Rupa, Rs 195) by Elaine Williams  is a biography of the Princess Brinda of Kapurthala, whom  the writer had first met on Park Avenue. The princess reminds  one of the Maharani of Pukkapore in Vile Bodies.  She had mingled with Marie of Rumania and assorted exiled  royalty in the Europe of the Twenties and Thirties. Cole  Porter wrote a song for her and Cecil Beaton did her portrait.  Vanity Fair wrote of her, in 1936, Princess Brinda...had  every woman green with envy...Emeralds the size of walnuts  hung from her ears and diamond necklaces by the yard circled  her throat. The Peruvian press thought that she looked  like a golden goddess descending from Heaven as she came  down the staircase at the Brazilian Embassy at Lima. You  were a little uncertain of your English in Delhi some years  ago, Queen Mary told her at Buckingham Palace, but I am  told you speak it now as well as you do French. It is a  pity that what could have been a delightfully entertaining  book is so shoddily written and so full of the most dreadful  typos.

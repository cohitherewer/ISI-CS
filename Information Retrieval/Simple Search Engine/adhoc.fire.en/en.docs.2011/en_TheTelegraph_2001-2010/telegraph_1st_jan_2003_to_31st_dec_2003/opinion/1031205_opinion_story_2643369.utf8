																								A History of Capitalism: 1500-2000 By Michel Beaud, Aakar, Rs 650 Very few will now disagree with  the proposition that capitalism represents the most profound  and far-reaching revolution in human history. The proposition  was put forward by the best-known critic of capitalism,  Karl Marx. It is no easy task to try and capture the dimensions  of this revolution in the compass of one volume. But this  is what Michel Beaud, a former professor of economics in  the University of Paris VIII at Vincennes, has attempted.  The result is a patchy volume where solid data and analysis  are cheek by jowl with comments not all that well grounded.  The themes in this book are well known: Europes conquest  of the New World; the first Industrial Revolution; the development  of world trade and the division of the world among the European  industrialized nations; the transport, communications and  information revolutions; the establishment of large and  global corporations and of global monetary and financial  networks; and an unceasing transformation of productive  techniques and lifestyles. GREED IS BAD The roaring nineties: seeds of  destruction By Joseph Stiglitz, Allen Lane,  13.50 There are few things more dangerous  than a reformed rake. He has the eagerness of a zealot who  has suddenly seen the Truth. Stiglitz, a Nobel prize-winning  economist, is unfortunately a recent convert to the criticism  of globalization. His first book on the subject, Globalization  and Its Discontents, has already become a bestseller  and has won critical acclaim. It needs to be recalled that  Stiglitz was once an advocate of the very institutions that  now promote globalization. In this book, he looks at the  boom and the bust of the Nineties. He argues that the boom  was artificially fuelled by the United States of America  and its excessive deregulation. The signs of the bust-up  were there to read even at the very beginning. At the root  was greed and Stiglitz takes a moral position against greed  which he thinks is bad for all concerned  individuals,  companies and societies. The tempering of greed is not only  good morality but good economics as well. The problem with  this trend of analysis is that greed, as has been pointed  out by previous critics of capitalism, is embedded in the  very working of the capitalist system. Is Stiglitz willing  to abandon capitalism? AN INDIAN IN BRITAIN																								An Encounter with Higher Education: My Years at the lse, By I.G. Patel, Oxford, Rs 495 																								I.G. Patel has, in his life time, held innumerable important posts. He is a distinguished economist who was the finance secretary and the governor of the Reserve Bank of India. The last job he held was director of the London School of Economics and Politics. He is now a knight of the British Empire but being an Indian citizen he cannot, alas, use the honorific that goes with a knighthood. This is a recollection of IGs days in LSE. The style is characteristically lucid, the wit dry and wry, and the anecdotes delightful. IG, not surprisingly, did not get on with Margaret Thatcher, who was then the prime minister of Britain. She once asked him why LSE always had foreigners as its head. The legend of LSE, Karl Popper, features in this book owing to his refusal to lend his name to a chair because a candidate of his liking wasnt appointed to it. No wonder the joke in the LSE was that Poppers classic book should have been called The Open Society by one of its Enemies.

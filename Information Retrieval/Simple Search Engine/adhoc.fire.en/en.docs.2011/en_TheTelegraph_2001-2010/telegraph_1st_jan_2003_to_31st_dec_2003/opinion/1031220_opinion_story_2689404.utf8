The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, December 20, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Great wall of India				 																																																				 Sir  Cometh the hour, cometh the man. Rahul Dravid proved the adage during the second test match at Adelaide (Belief that India can do it, Dec 17). Yet despite his high batting average, fielding skills and commitment to the game, the vice-captain continues to be the most under-rated cricketer in the Indian team. This is indeed a blessing in disguise.While his team mates are busy endorsing products, the Indian vice-captain continues to feature regularly on the sports pages. Perhaps we need a few more Dravids, not Tendulkars and Gangulys, to improve our overseas record.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Payel Sharma, Calcutta
				 																One for the road				 																																																				Sir  A recent government notification states that applicants will soon have to undergo stringent tests to get international driving licences (Steep curve ahead for global licence, Nov 23). Similar stringency should be enforced for domestic licences as well. Indian roads are already virtual death traps. Road manners and traffic etiquette are things of the past. Parking on footpaths, honking near hospitals, exceeding stop lines at traffic lights are accepted practice in India. Even law enforcers do not object to these violations. The move to bring back discipline on the Indian roads must start with making driving tests more stringent. There should also be an aptitude test conducted by psychologists before permitting someone to sit behind the wheels.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Pal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Bus owners on the Calcutta-Siliguri route are perhaps not the only ones who suffer because of the horrible condition of national highways in north Bengal. The 608 kilometre highway is in a terrible state, especially in Murshidabad. While passengers avoid the road, drivers and conductors are doing their duties reluctantly. But thousands of vehicles have to travel daily through the national highway numbers 34 and 31. Their condition speaks poorly of the state as well. Bus owners are even ready to pay toll taxes for the immediate betterment of the roads.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Prakash Chandra Sinha, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The public works department is putting up dividers on Jessore Road which is also being widened. The dividers are sometimes as wide as 8 feet, nullifying the purpose of widening the road. They also cause accidents at night because street lighting is virtually absent on this road. A simple white demarcating line would have done the trick. Instead the government is keen on having concrete dividers. Is it because that gives contractors more opportunity to make money? However, a municipality which cannot remove traffic congestion right under its nose at Nagerbazar, can hardly be expected to do things properly. 				 																																																				In Dum Dum and Howrah, the two entry points to Calcutta, the road conditions are pathetic. Investors who wish to set up projects are whisked down VIP Road and into Salt Lake. But the real Bengal lies within these two municipalities. How much more taxes should we pay to make our roads motorable? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M.K. Rathi, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Bijon Setu, the overbridge connecting Rashbehari Avenue with the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, needs repairs. Almost all the street lights on the bridge do not function. Some lamp-posts are broken. It is very difficult and dangerous to drive on this stretch at night and there have been frequent accidents because of this. This stretch is a major thoroughfare for residents of Kasba and New Ballygunge. The matter should be looked into immediately.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anindya Kundu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I am a daily passenger of Eastern Railway (Sealdah division) and travel from Shyamnagar to Bidhannagar to attend work. I would like to state that the condition of the down platform subway leading to the main VIP road is pathetic. It is full of garbage and people use it as a urinal although local children continue to play there and vendors sell their products on this stretch. The obnoxious odour is a horrible experience for daily commuters like us. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Surajit Chakraborty, Calcutta

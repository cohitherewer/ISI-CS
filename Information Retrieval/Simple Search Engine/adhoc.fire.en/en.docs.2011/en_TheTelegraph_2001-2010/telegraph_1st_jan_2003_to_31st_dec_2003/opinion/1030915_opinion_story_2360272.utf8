		 Monday, September 15, 2003  DELIVERING THE GOODS
 - The latest RBI report is evidence of careful and wise guidance  S. VENKITARAMANAN The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India Bimal Jalans successful stewardship  of the Reserve Bank of India has ended in a burst of glory.  It has been an eventful period starting with rumblings on  the exchange rate front when Bimal Jalan hastened to use  the conventional tools of central banks to control the rupees  depreciation. As he leaves, he faces the  weak  criticism  for the reverse phenomenon of the appreciation of the rupee.  Jalan has, in his own lucid way, explained the policies  that the RBI has been following and the limited options  that he faced. He managed the onrush of abundance with the  same nonchalance as he did the problems of an attack on  the rupee. He leaves the RBI with the conscious assurance  of a manager who has delivered the goods. The RBIs report  for 2002-03 is a credible testimony to his successful tutelage  of the bank. As is usual with the RBIs annual  reports, the latest one also continues the tradition of  reporting on the nations economy while at the same time  commenting on the state of accounts of the central bank  as well as the various changes brought about in the year.  The report tells a credible story of progress on various  fronts  both domestic and external  with reasonable price  stability and a rate of economic growth that is higher than  that of many other countries, barring China. The year gone by challenged the  ingenuity of the top management of the central bank as well  as the government of India. The global economic slowdown  created a tough environment for our exporters, both of goods  and services. Added to this came drought, which called for  and got a swift response from the authorities. Food supply  was maintained with a drawdown from the abundant stocks,  alleviated by a reduction in central issue prices. Inflation  remained weak for the better part of the year, rising during  the latter half of the year due to global increases in fuel  prices. The Centres fiscal situation  as well as that of the states came under strain because  of drought-induced effects on both expenditure and revenue.  Relief expenditures and increased food subsidies worsened  the deficit. So did the slowdown in revenues, reflecting  slackness in growth of demand. The government, however,  reiterated its determination to achieve the goal of fiscal  sustainability through its various tax reform programmes  as well as changes in expenditure management. Efforts on  debt management continued. The report notes that the year  was marked by increased liquidity in the financial sector,  thanks to the large inflow of foreign exchange reserves.  The RBI took various steps to manage the excess liquidity,  while taking advantage of the resulting easing of rates.  Financial reforms, including those regarding the provisions  made by banks for sub-standard loans, continued apace. The  emphasis continued to be on rapid convergence with international  best practices. There was also a step-up in the pace of  legal reforms in the financial sector, particularly in the  area of recovery of problem assets. The report also notes  the considerable advance in the introduction of modern technological  aids to the financial sector. This continues the encouraging  trend of technological modernization of banks over the last  few years. The report raises serious concerns  about the poor state of progress with respect to a number  of investment projects in the public sector. Some Central  sector projects are reported to have been delayed during  the year, owing to inadequacy of financial resources, delays  in acquisition of land, problems relating to award of contracts,  delays in obtaining clearances, and lack of adequate infrastructural  support. Cost overruns of such projects amounted to 59 per  cent of the original cost of such projects in 2002-03, an  indicator of poor project management. The power sector on  which the country depends alone accounted for 52 per cent  of these overruns. Such poor management of ongoing projects  bodes ill for the success of the ambitious expectations  of the tenth plan, which visualizes giant investments in  the Central and state sector. Obviously, the time has come  to overhaul public sector management practices, if the tenth  plan is to succeed. The RBI report notes that the  bulge in food stocks has come down, thanks to improvements  in procurement and food management policies in the year.  The food stocks decreased from 62.6 million tones in April  2002 to 35.2 million tones in June 2003. One interesting  offshoot of this decrease is the reduction in bank credit  against food grain stocks. But, the data in the report show  that as against a sharp reduction of nearly 40 per cent  in the closing stocks financed by such credit, the magnitude  of credit has decreased only marginally from Rs 52,484 crore  to Rs 50,066 crore. Does this mean that the banks are over-financing  stocks? Or is it a case of banks financing the government  against flawed collateral? The report notes that the industrial  sector saw a modest revival during the year, particularly  boosted by export orders. Whether the trend will continue  turns on the improvement in agricultural prospects. The  rural economy is still weak and an important determinant  of the economys growth. The annual report takes legitimate  credit for the improvements on the external front. One important  feature is that for the second consecutive year, the current  account of the economy moved into a surplus. In addition,  capital receipts from abroad grew apace, aided by non-resident  Indian deposits as well as by foreign direct investment.  The reserves grew substantially as a result. The report  notes that on August 15, 2003, India held the sixth largest  stock of international reserve assets among the emerging  market economies  at $85 billion. In terms of foreign currency  assets alone, India ranks seventh in the world  a creditable  achievement and a long march away from the crisis of 1991. The report notes that the disposition  of the reserves is confined to creditworthy instruments  held abroad. Partly, they are invested with the Bank for  International Settlement. While it is true that the RBI  has earned kudos for its successful management of foreign  exchange rates and reserves, it would still help the cause  of transparency if it discloses in the report itself the  broad distribution of its investments, by category, not  necessarily by specific assets. Particular concerns arise  because the income from the investment of foreign assets  declined during the year from 4.47 per cent in the previous  year to 3.1 per cent. True, it is reflective of the generally  low global interest rates. After all, our reserves are financing  the tremendous appetite of richer nations at low rates of  return. But, it would be helpful if the RBI publishes comparative  data regarding the returns earned from similar investments  by other countries, which have also substantial reserves,  such as China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. Apart from reporting on the state  of the economy, the annual report also incorporates details  of the accounts of the RBI itself. Reflecting the lower  interest rate environment, the overall income of the central  bank declined marginally from Rs 24,694 crore in 2001-02  to Rs 23,185 crore in 2002-03. Out of this income, the bank  provides for contributions to reserve funds, which are in  the nature of prudential reserves. The amount available  for actual expenditure after taking into account these transfers  is the net disposable income of the bank, which has declined  marginally from Rs 16,866 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 15,561  crore in 2002-03. Out of this, after allowing for its normal  expenditure, the bank has a net surplus, which it transfers  to the government of India. This amount in 2002-03 comes  to Rs 8,834 crore as against Rs 10,320 crore in 2001-02.  Consequently, the relief to the Indian governments revenue  budget has declined marginally, although the government  has also gained substantially from the overall reduction  in interest rates. The RBIs contributions to the  asset development fund and contingency fund have already  reached a level of 11.7 per cent of total assets  almost  near the set norm of 12 per cent. Whether the RBI should  continue to contribute large sums to reserves, affecting  the amount of disposable surplus, is yet not clear. The  large accretions to forex assets are kept in creditworthy  assets. In view of this, the relevance and desirability  of further contributions to rupee-denominated funds have  to be examined. Overall, the RBIs latest annual  report tells a good story of achievement and tells it well.  It is a report to the nation, which Bimal Jalan can be proud  of, as he leaves his post for his next one, as member of  the Rajya Sabha.

																								HIMALAYAS: AN AESTHETIC ADVENTURE (The Art Institute of Chicago and Mapin, $ 39.95) is an extensive catalogue that accompanies the ongoing exhibition by the same name at the Regenstein Hall of the Art Institute of Chicago. The exhibition, which brings together the art and artefacts of an immense geographical stretch, from Gilgit, Nepal, Himachal Pradesh to Tibet, is Pratapaditya Pals attempt, as visiting curator of the institute, to make people see more of the art than read about it. This is why the introduction to each exhibit, dating back to the 6th to the 19th century, whether painting, cast bronze or temple sculpture, is pithy while being learned. The objects dart are mainly inspired by religion, Hinduism and Buddhism, like this 14th century painting of Vajrakila Vajrakumar and consort, a quintessentially Tibetan thangka using pigment and gold on cotton. This contextual work accentuates a rare effort.

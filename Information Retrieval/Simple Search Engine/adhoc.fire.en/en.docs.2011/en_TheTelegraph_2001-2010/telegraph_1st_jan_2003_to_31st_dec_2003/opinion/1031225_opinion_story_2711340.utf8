 															- Document  From the Asian Centre for Human Rights  alternate report for the UN committee on the rights of the  child 				 	 Harsh lessons																								Case 5: National Human Rights Commissions intervention against the corporal punishment of Aarti Saroj																								In the first week of July 2003, the NHRC directed the education secretary in the Delhi government as well as the director of primary education in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to appear before it on July 30 2003 about the corporal punishment. The order was given by the NHRC, pursuant to its intervention against the corporal punishment given to Aarti Saroj, a student of Class VI in the government co-educational senior secondary school, Mukherjee Nagar, by her class teacher on September 21, 2001. Saroj had received grievous injuries. A report from the education secretary to the NHRC denied the allegations. 																								On consideration of the reports received from the education secretary, additional DCP as well as the comments of the complaint on the report and the complaint of the father of the victim, the commission was prima facie satisfied that the student was administered corporal punishment by her teacher in the school. The commission had earlier observed that though it did not propose to proceed in the case, it was an important and fundamental issue, which required its consideration whether the Delhi School Education Act permitted corporal punishment to children in schools.																								Case 6: children given corporal punishment																								On August 5, 2003, about 600 minor children studying in VIII standard of Government Senior Secondary School at Chheharta, Amritsar, Punjab, were allegedly severely beaten up by the drawing teacher with a stick. They were kicked and abused for not bringing some geometry box instruments in his class. The beating allegedly was so severe that seven children got contusions and marks of the beating.																								Ram Singh (13) cried with pain as he lifted his shirt to show marks of beating to the local journalists. He cried that he plied an autorickshaw after school to meet his school and household expenses and could not buy the geometry instruments then, as he was awaiting his scholarship to make the purchase.																								Case 7: Students stripped for skipping homework																								On August 13, 2003, Sadhan Pal, the headmaster of Krisnapalli Prathamik Vidyalaya, Malda district of West Bengal, ordered the third graders to strip for not doing their homework. The class had 48 students and all but two faced the punishment. Among the students, mostly from impoverished families, were pre-teen girls, whose parents took strong exception to the headmasters order. Only two of the 48 students in the class were found to have done their homework. When the others failed to answer the questions the headmaster asked, the parents said the headmaster told them to strip and stand on benches, brandishing his cane. Some obeyed. Those who resisted were caned ruthlessly.																								Case 8: Teacher breaks students bone as punishment																								On August 13, 2003, Subba Rao, mathematics teacher of DAV Public School at Sufilguda, Hyderabad, Andhra Padesh, almost broke the upper portion of Ananditas left hand as punishment for not completing her homework. It was only after the girl started complaining of excruciating pain that Subba Rao took a coser look at the arm. He found the upper portion severely injured. He informed the school authorities who took her to a local orthopedic hospital. She was given first aid and the case was declared as medico-legal. TO BE CONCLUDED

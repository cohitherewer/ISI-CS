 - Higher education institutions cannot easily be self-financing  in India  DIPANKAR DASGUPTA The author is professor of economics,  Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta Low priority  All its sycophants, ones that  wait with bated breath and whispering humbleness for the  hyenas shares of the leftovers, must pursue with diligence  whatever edicts emerge from the superpower. The society  we live in is no exception to this. As soon as the United  States of America declared the need for higher education  to be self-financing, we decided to join the bandwagon without  a slightest thought about the attributes that distinguish  the two societies. And one of the most important differences  between them lies in the quality of education that an average  individual has received. One does not need to quote statistics  to prove that the US or other similarly placed countries  have a population that is incomparably superior in terms  of its educational characteristics. Thus, recession induced cuts in  the state university budgets cause little harm in the US  compared to the devastation it leads to in poorer countries.  There are at least two reasons why a deceleration in the  growth of institutions of higher education in India will  precipitate long-term damages in this country. The first  of these will harm its social fabric irreparably, while  the second will precipitate an economic ruin of absurd proportions. To start with the social phenomenon,  one feels tempted to quote from the celebrated court scene  in The Merchant of Venice: As there is no firm reason  to be renderd,/...So can I give no reason, nor I will not...  Shylock said this in rage when called upon to justify his  maniacal preference for a pound of Antonios flesh over  the three thousand ducats that the latter owed him, merely  because the payment had not been made on time. However abused  by the Christian community, a part of Shylocks ultimate  tragedy lay surely in his refusal to listen to the voice  of reason. But passion, engendered by a lack of education,  is a force that finds expression in the destruction of all  and sundry and, unlike the finale in Shylocks story, can  smother to extinction centuries of creativity that reason  alone can foster. Passion leads to mindless destruction.  Or else, why should the magnificent library and museum at  Alexandria have perished in a civil war? The Greeks lost  their geometry to the Barbarians, to be retrieved by the  Arabs, but only fortuitously. And closer to home, both in  space and time, could primary education alone, which in  this society may not amount to much more than a vague knowledge  of the alphabet, prevent the Gujarat outrage? Right now,  lunacy reigns supreme in Ayodhya. The Archeological Survey  of India is engaged in a journey to the centre of the earth  to substantiate mortal claims about godly hierarchies. The coffers are declared, however,  to be empty when it comes to educating people, though the  most important product of education is reason. Imparting  higher education is an activity that is rapidly acquiring  the complexion of sinful luxury. The logic indeed is imported  from the Yankee world. A beauty parlour gives a haircut  to improve your appearance, an extravagance only the rich  can afford. An orthodontist gives your teeth a texture as  smooth as alabaster, a need that may be felt by the likes  of Karisma Kapoor. All such services lead to observable  and verifiable personal gains and must be paid for.  Unfortunately though, the personal  gains are less palpable for the services rendered by a college  or a university teacher. A professor of history analyses  for you events that occurred in the distant past. A mathematician  expounds on the wonders of logical paradoxes. Like the barber  and the dentist, the professor is also supplying a service,  which amounts to selling to the customer a right to a claim  on his expertise. The benefit, however, that it imparts  to society at large is not readily measurable by means of  a pair of scales. Yet, it is only a well-educated society  that can appreciate the worth of human learning. An interesting anecdote concerning  Euclid illustrates the point. To quote from Russells History  of Western Philosophy, It is said that a pupil, after  listening to a demonstration, asked what he would gain by  learning geometry, whereupon Euclid called a slave and said  Give the young man three-pence, since he must needs make  a gain out of what he learns. ... No one in Greek times,  supposed that conic sections had any utility; at last, in  the seventeenth century, Galileo discovered that projectiles  move in parabolas, and Kepler discovered that planets moved  in ellipses. The Euclid story demonstrates  that the love for pure knowledge is not as sinful as it  is currently being made out to be. Indeed, there is a curious  similarity between business investments and academic research.  In both cases the result is uncertain. Only, in the first  case, the gains and the losses show up within a reasonably  short duration of time. In the latter case, it could take  years. The trouble of course is that politicians, like business  houses, are concerned with the short run. No one understands  better than a politician the meaning of Keynes dictum,  In the long run we are all dead. Coming over to the economic gains  of higher education, ministers cry themselves hoarse over  the growth rate of economies. Recent research in economic  theory has demonstrated beyond doubt that the growth rate  of an economy depends as much on investment in physical  capital accumulation as on the development of an educated  labour force. The same physical capital equipment is more  productive in the hands of a highly skilled individual than  it is in the hands of an unskilled worker.  Societies progress economically  not merely through the accumulation of physical capital,  but also through what has now been widely recognized as  human capital. As the Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas pointed  out, productivity of capital is low in societies where the  quality of the labour force is poor. If this were not the  case, then capital deficient economies could gain significantly  from the flow of capital from richer societies. The fact,  however, is that poorer societies do not attract capital  on account of the low performance of their labour force. However indirect and delayed may  be the intended effects of higher education, a government  fails in its duty if it accords to it a priority that is  less than what it deserves. On the other hand, it is also  a fact that government finances are in the doldrums all  over the world. The announced policies requiring institutions  of higher education to collaborate with the private sector  by inviting income-generating projects for the institutions  seem to be of dubious value.  First of all, do college or university  teachers have the time available to work on income-earning  projects after performing their teaching responsibilities?  Particularly so for undergraduate colleges, where the norm  during peak seasons is that a teacher deliver twenty-four  lectures a week?  Secondly, academic research is  more often than not as far removed from projects offered  by business houses to calculate the expected profitability  of their contemplated ventures. Indeed, a college teacher  or a university professor may turn out to be highly successful  in generating funds through business projects, without adding  an iota to the creation of knowledge for the youngsters  who attend the classes. Can capital markets help? Unlikely,  for banks stand ready to lend to would-be MBAs, but not  to others. For them, higher education is too risky an investment.  For the government, on the other hand, it is a vice that  a developing economy can ill afford. Universities had therefore  started to charge capitation fees, which the Supreme Court  has now banned. Can institutions of higher education survive  in this scenario? Perhaps the rich will find a solution  for their children. Send them abroad. In the meantime what  sort of a society shall we be heading towards? For whom  indeed are the bells tolling?

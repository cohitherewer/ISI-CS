To resolve the conflicting interests among stakeholders in a balanced harmony in terms of flood control, water use, and environmental conservation, consensus building and appropriate distribution of roles are necessary. Lowlands are strongly influenced by high water level changes. This particularity adds a distinctive complication to the current water conflict (i.e., lack of information, water shortage, and environmental stress) and conflicting interest between stake- holders. 																								Actions: promote the importance of innovative flood control measures (e.g. hazard map) through a participatory process and share experience with flood-affected people... Start multi-stakeholders dialogue on sustainable tourism in the United Nations year of eco-tourism. Seven NGOs from all around the world presented their eco-tourism initiative and contacts to travel agencies. Enhance and alleviate the implementation of hydrosolidarity concept as a background towards compatibility within an integrated land/water/ecosystem management. 																								In Japan and many other countries, various successful measures have been executed to realize sustainable sediment management measures of reservoirs. The concept of integrated sediment management in the total sediment flow system has been well understood and executed in Japan. 																								Drafting of the Guideline of River Restoration is to serve as a basic principal in river restoration activities. The guideline initiative was used as a platform for discussion with other sessions sharing compatible vision and eco-perspectives. From the output reports of studied situations on water resources development and management of some Asian monsoon countries (i.e. Japan and Korea), it becomes clear that a comprehensive and effective water resources development and long term organization and management are needed for sound development of industry and agriculture and elevation of living standards in all monsoon countries... 																								Promoting flexible dialogue among conflicting stakeholders through communication, daily conversion, upstream and downstream corporation. Efforts to keep close relationship between human and rivers so that everyone recognizes the necessity of harmonized management between flood control, water use, and environmental conservation.

Recommendations: the enormous diversity of water problems and challenges faced by water professionals, administrators and stakeholders, within the world river basins, have stressed the authoritative aspect of promoting global information networks to serve as archive of best practices, learning material for capacity building and platform for discussion, guidance and sharing of experience in every aspect of water resources, ecosystem and environmental development. Multi-stakeholder partnerships and international NGOs cooperation for the protection of water environment (i.e., lakes and wetlands) at regional, country and local levels should be promoted TO BE CONCLUDED

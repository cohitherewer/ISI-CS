		 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 HOW THE REPORTERS WON HIM THE WAR
 Gouri Chatterjee																								Finally, it was the Iraqi journalists who gave George Bush his biggest public relations victory. The dishevelled, disoriented images of the deposed dictator were dramatic enough. But it was the roar of approval that rose from Iraqi journalists gathered to witness a moment in history at Baghdad, last Sunday, that gave America the greatest legitimacy in turning a whole nation upside down. Providing, too, yet another evidence of Iraqs long road to international benchmarks. If this is the media, what hope then of something far more complex as the trial of Saddam Hussein?																								International standards decree journalists covering a story should act professionally, that is, be unemotional, impartial, objective. Or at least appear to be so, for the sake of credibility. They should not cheer news or take sides blatantly.																								The Iraqi reporters last Sunday were there to cover a press conference, albeit a climactic one. Instead, they started screaming Death to Saddam! and thanking US soldiers for tracking him down. As the Daily Telegraph of London reported, While Western journalists asked for details of how US troops closed in on Saddam, Iraqi journalists kept pushing for details on Saddams fate.																								To the watching West, the answer was simple: it was an understandable reaction to the brutality and repression of the Saddam regime. 																								Nothing could have better suited a White House eager to send out the message that this is an Iraqi victoryas well as dispel any doubt among Iraqis and a sceptical Arab world that it was truly Saddam Hussein who was in American hands. That public display of emotion by the Iraqi reporters said it all. 																								Journalist is as journalist does, and that does not begin or end with what he or she reports. It is all the more imperative therefore to remember how easy it is to get used. Of course, the Bush administration has shown itself particularly skilled in this matter. The New York Times reports that even the announcement of Saddam Husseins capture followed a careful plan devised over months. It does not mention that cheering by Iraqi scribes was part of the script or that the US administrator in Iraq would come to the press conference armed with next days headlines. Fingers crossed																								Media bosses of the first world are working feverishly. The capture of the fallen despot means that the Saddam saga gets longer and longer. Like their soldiers, theres no going home soon for their newsmen. Rather, plans  and budgets  will have to be drawn up for the coverage of the Saddam trial. 																								Normally, Indian bosses have no such headaches. But given the close competition between the news channels today, one can hope for some coverage of this blockbuster of a news event through Indian eyes and ears. The difference that can make is to be seen on NDTV 24x7. The intrepid Barkha Dutts reports from Baghdad cannot be mistaken for those on BBC or CNN. Lets keep our fingers crossed that her money talks longer too. Sibling rivalry?																								It is not just a thinking mans inflight magazine. The second issue of National Review has shown signs of a life that is highly uncommon in the Indian media. The editorial by Inderjit Badhwar bristles with quotable quotes. Just one example: Which newspaper or magazine will dare to kick butt at the spectacle of Prabhu Chawla mooing guffishly on channels owned by his own publishing group, or dare to analyse Shekhar Guptas NDTV-televised psychological proximity to Nebuchadnezzar when it is repeated in doublespread in The Indian Express, or even cluck a tongue at bad reporting on Star News when Hindustan Times editor Vir Sanghvi has a cosy slot in which he can get away with doing a soft, mushy interview with Mani Shankar Aiyar, his personal buddy since the Rajiv Gandhi days? Sibling rivalry? All go back a long way, to their early days in India Today.

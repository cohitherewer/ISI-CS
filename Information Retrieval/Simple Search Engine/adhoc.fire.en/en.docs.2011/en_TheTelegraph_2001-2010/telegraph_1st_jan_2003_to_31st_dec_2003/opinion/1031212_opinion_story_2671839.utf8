		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 FAR TOO MANY MAHARAJAS 
 THE UNFORGETTABLE MAHARAJAS (Roli,  Rs 3,500) by E. Jaiwant Paul, makes a few faces of Indian  royalty more unforgettable than the rest. This is not entirely  his own doing. If the royalty of Kapurthala, Patiala, Baroda  and some other princely states recur, it is probably because  some of these characters in front of the camera were more  alive and colourful than the rest. A hundred and fifty years  of photography connected with Indian royalty, besides bringing  to the fore the beauty of the zen- ana, the shine  of the family je- wels, the splendour as well as the decay  of the maharajas in the shadow of the swiftly overtaking  raj, also shows up the funny side of this never-to-be-replaced  generation. This gem from the Pataudi album has a stuffed  tiger surrounded by brave hunters. The hunt in dusty attics  and damp basements has unearthed a priceless collection,  but arent there far too many maharajas on our coffee-tables  these days?

He is one Vedic god who refuses to oblige. But this has been the year when Lord Varuna has been more than kind to India. So much so, that the showers might result in early general elections																								Invoking the Vedic gods is admittedly not the monopoly of the saffron brotherhood. It was in the Congress years that the bust of Kubera, the god of wealth, took position at the door of the Reserve Bank of India. And when the peacock became the national bird, what perhaps counted more than the splendour of its plumage was its strong associative link with Kartikeya, the god of warfare. It was an icon waiting to be resurrected after Indias adherence to non-violence took a beating from the Chinese in 1962.																								However, the Vedic god whom the advocates of cultural nationalism have inexplicably overlooked is Varuna. He is the guardian of the cosmic order and the all-seeing god of the sky who descended from his heavenly palace to become the god of the waters. To the present inhabitants of the land of the Vedas, the connection between the sky that holds the coils of nimbus during the monsoon, and the turning of the wheel of economy is all too obvious. 																								The Shining India which, as the authors of the epithet in Raisina Hill hope, will radiate its lustre on the BJP in the general elections 2004, has indeed been burnished by Varuna with great care this time round. As the monsoon ended, 33 of the countrys 36 meteorological subdivisions had received normal or excess rainfall, the rains being scanty in just three. But last year as many as 56 per cent of these subdivisions were dry, with Punjab and Haryana, the countrys wheat bowl, recording a 36 per cent deviation from normal rainfall. Rainfall in the three previous years, 1999 to 2001, was also unsatisfactory, though in none of those years was it as bad as in the last.																								How about putting it down to the curse of Varuna, a deity as difficult to please as Jehovah of the Old Testament? The economic cost of Varunas scowl was backbreaking. Agriculture and allied sectors recorded a negative growth, in 2002-03, of 3.1 per cent. It jammed the brake on the overall GDP, which grew a measly 4.3 per cent. The growth of industrial production, at 5.3 per cent, fell far short of the 6.7 per cent in 1997-98, the last pre-saffron year. As the fields were parched, and peoples income fell, the additional cost of relief pushed up government expenditure. Budget deficit touched 5.9 per cent of GDP, from 4.7 per cent the year before.																								Varuna may not be easily placated, but his verdict surely is unpredictable. The copious rainfall this year has not only brought the hope of a six to eight per cent GDP growth but investors are now willing to gamble on the already bullish stock market. So buoyant is Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee with the feel-good factor that he now desires that the per capita income doubles in 10 years, instead of 20 years in the past. This optimism may be translated into ordering the general elections early next year instead of October, when its due. For who knows when Varuna will decide to reverse his judgment?																								Varunas sway over India comes from a simple fact: about a fourth of Indias GDP is generated from agriculture, but more than three-fifths of the populace live off it. In the developed economies, the share of agriculture in both GDP and population have shrunk below five per cent and most people make a living in services. But Indias service sector, with 48.8 per cent share of GDP (in 2001), accounts for just 18 per cent of jobs.																								The star of the service sector is obviously the IT sector, which has so far managed to defy the diktat of Varuna. Software exports drew in revenues of Rs 47,500 crore last year whereas the IT Enabled Services (ITES) generated Rs 11,700 crore. All this, in addition to a domestic IT market of Rs 31,700 crore. The rush for India to outsorce IT jobs has left the West panicky. Responding to a recent Business Week cover story on India (The Rise of India, December 8), an American reader writes: Perhaps his [American industrial worker] third career [after the second job, on being retrained in IT, goes to India] should be in plumbing, painting or gardening, as those jobs should not be outsourced anytime soon.																								But the bottomline is that the IT sector contributes 3.5 per cent to the GDP while it employs no more than 700,000 people. Besides, and more importantly, the Indian IT industry has grown with its sight riveted to export, the home market being minuscule. The countrys PC population is just about nine million, or nine for 1,000 people, whereas the global average is 27. The IT jobs can not multiply on the back of local demand, nor can these spread to hick towns. At any rate, with 35 per cent of the population still illiterate, the keyboard may not be the instrument of employment of the millions yet.																								That takes us back to the somewhat jaded contradiction between India and Bharat. If India of the service sector manages to over-ride its saturation risks, and co-opts its siblings in the industrial enterprises (including the sick ones), one would still have the 600 million or so inhabitants of Bharat left at the mercy of Varuna. In a year when Varuna is cruel, the man of Bharat will lose even his limited power to buy a new bicycle or sari. 																								The consequent drop in demand will have its thud reverberate across the economy, causing gloomy forecasts, deferred investments, sticky credit and a lot of feel bad factor. The depressed sentiment is not much different from the prayer to Varuna of a man afflicted with dropsy, as quoted from the Rig Veda by A.L. Basham in his The Wonder That Was India: When I go tottering, like a blown-up bladder,/ Forgive, o gracious Lord, forgive.

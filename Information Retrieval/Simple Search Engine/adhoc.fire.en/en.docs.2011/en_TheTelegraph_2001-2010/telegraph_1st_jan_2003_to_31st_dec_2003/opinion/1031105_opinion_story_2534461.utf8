 															- Document Extracts from the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, April 2003 To be concluded				 	 At a greater risk																								Objective 1: Equality of opportunity throughout life with respect to continuing education, training and retraining as well as vocational guidance and placement services. 																								Actions: (a) Achieve a 50 per cent improvement in levels of adult literacy by 2015, especially for women, and equitable access to basic and continuing education for all adults; (b) Encourage and promote literacy, numeracy and technological skills training for older persons and the ageing workforce, including specialized literacy and computer training for older persons with disabilities; 																								(c) Implement policies that promote access to training and retraining for older workers and encourage them to continue to use their acquired knowledge and skills after retirement; (d) Ensure that the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communication technologies, are available to all, taking into account the needs of older women;...																								Objective 2: Full utilization of the potential and expertise of persons of all ages, recognizing the benefits of increased experience with age. 																								Actions: (a) Consider measures to fully utilize the potential and expertise of older persons in education; (b) Provide opportunities within educational programmes for the exchange of knowledge and experience between generations, including the use of new technologies; (c) Enable older persons to act as mentors, mediators and advisers; 																								(d) Encourage and support traditional and non-traditional multigenerational mutual assistance activities with a clear gender perspective in the family, the neighbourhood and the community; (e) Encourage older volunteers to offer their skills in all fields of activities, in particular information technologies;... 																								Solidarity between generations at all levels  in families, communities and nations  is fundamental for the achievement of a society for all ages. Solidarity is also a major prerequisite for social cohesion and a foundation of formal public welfare and informal care systems. Changing demographic, social and economic circumstances require the adjustment of pension, social security, health and long-term care systems to sustain economic growth and development and to ensure adequate and effective income maintenance and service provision... 																								Objective 1: Strengthening of solidarity through equity and reciprocity between generations. 																								Actions: (a) Promote understanding of ageing through public education as an issue of concern to the entire society; (b) Consider reviewing existing policies to ensure that they foster solidarity between generations and thus promoting social cohesion; (c) Develop initiatives aimed at promoting mutual, productive exchange between the generations, focusing on older persons as a societal resource; (d) Maximize opportunities for maintaining and improving intergenerational relations in local communities, inter alia, by facilitating meetings for all age groups and avoiding generational segregation;... 																								The struggle against poverty among older persons, aiming towards its eradication, is a fundamental aim of the International Plan of Action on Ageing. Although global attention has recently been focussed more actively on poverty eradication targets and policies, older persons in many countries still tend to be excluded from these policies and programmes. Where poverty is endemic, persons who survive a lifetime of poverty often face an old age of deepening poverty.																								For women, institutional biases in social protection systems, in particular those based on uninterrupted work histories, contribute further to the feminization of poverty. Gender inequalities and disparities in economic power-sharing, unequal distribution of unremunerated work between women and men, lack of technological and financial support for womens entrepreneurship, unequal access to, and control over, capital, in particular land and credit and access to labour markets, as well as all harmful traditional and customary practices, have constrained womens economic empowerment and exacerbated the feminization of poverty. In many societies, female-headed households, including divorced, separated and unmarried women and widows, are at particular risk of poverty. Special social protection measures are required to address feminization of poverty, in particular among older women. 																								Older persons with disabilities are also at greater risk of poverty than the non-disabled older persons partly because of workplace discrimination, including employer discrimination, and the absence of workplace accommodation of their needs.

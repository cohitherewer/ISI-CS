 Jhelum Biswas																								BRIDE AT TEN, MOTHER AT FIFTEEN By Sethu Ramaswamy, Roli, Rs 295																								The subtitle of the book  Autobiography of an Unknown Indian Woman is reminiscent of Nirad C. Chaudhuris Autobiography of an Unknown Indian. The similarity does not end here. Like the latter, Sethu Ramaswamys autobiography is not simply a personal history but also a history of the sub-continent. What distinguishes this work is that it is not only the story of an unknown Indian but an unknown Indian woman  a woman who has lived in two centuries and has seen her own family and the country make the transition from tradition to modernity.																								Very humbly, Ramaswamy points out that This narrative is just a story of my life; it is nothing spectacular or great. But what could be more spectacular or greater than the fact that it is a work by a seventy-nine-year-old housewife? It is the fulfilment of the dreams of a woman who, on her fortieth birthday, promised herself henceforth I would do what I liked and would make my own decisions. 																								The book is certainly an achievement for a high-spirited girl who had to give up her formal education to enter domesticity. As a mother of six girls, she had a wonderful life and a loving husband, but most of her life was spent inside the kitchen and working as an unrecognized secretary for her journalist husband. She remembers her husband fondly, Sweetly and gently, but firmly, he ruled the family. In such sentences, and at other times explicitly, Ramaswamy states her grievances against her husband who encouraged others to be educated, but callously neglected his wifes desire for education. To her husband she was like a child. She was punished the same way that her children were punished by her husband. Her story subtly reveals the status of women in those days, their lack of choice in matters of food, clothing, education, marriage, pregnancy, or children. Yet Sethus narrative is a curious one. It is the voice of a woman caught between two worlds  tradition and individuality. On the one there is this woman striving to find her own voice, and on the other she is ready to echo the voice that dictates her.																								Ramaswamy divides the book into three parts. The first deals with her childhood in Ceylon. The next is her stay at her in-laws house in Trivandrum, and the final section is about her life with her husband and daughters in Delhi. Along with her story, Ramaswamy weaves in the history of the nation and the story of the way in which social and political events affect domesticity. The book should be read for its representation of history. But, most important, for being written by a woman who made a quantum leap from kindergarten to post graduation. 						JHELUM BISWAS

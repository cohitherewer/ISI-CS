 - Welcoming FDI with an eye to national benefit is the best  approach  S.Venkitaramanan The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India Transnational companies have become  an important feature of most economies in the world today.  Typical of the impact of globalization is the fact that  transnational companies alone account for an added value  of about a tenth of the worlds gross domestic product.  They had a share of 5 per cent in 1982. The data provided  by the World Investment Report 2003, issued by the  United Nations conference on trade and development recently,  show that transnational corporations  numbering around  64,000 in various countries and operating about 870,000  foreign affiliates  have become an important fixture on  the global landscape. They employed an estimated 53 million  workers in 2002, an increase from 20 million in 1982. The  stock of foreign direct investment belonging to transnational  corporations generated a total sales of nearly $18 trillion,  more than double the worlds exports. The network of foreign  affiliate companies accounted for more than one-third of  the worlds exports. FDI is, therefore, an inescapable attribute  of the world economy. Critics of globalization need  to note that the FDI is also not only from rich countries  to rich countries. The developed world, such as the United  States of America, United Kingdom, European Union, is itself  holding two-thirds of the worlds inward FDI stock. What  is more interesting is that the EU has nearly $ 3 trillion  outward stock of FDI compared to half of the US. The myth  of dominance of the US amongst transnational companies has  to be taken with a pinch of salt. In recent decades, the developing  countries have also increasingly come to depend on FDI in  comparison with other forms of capital inflows. The FDI  stock for developing countries on an average accounts for  nearly a third of GDP. The dependence of developed countries  is, however, less in as much as the ratio of FDI stocks  to GDP for developed countries is only 19 per cent. The  growth of FDI in the last decade is seen from the fact that  the stock of FDI has increased from 13 per cent in respect  of developing countries to nearly 33 per cent in the period.  In respect of developed countries also, the increase is  from 5 per cent to 19 per cent. The inward direct investment as  a percentage of GDP varied widely among various countries.  As of 2002, the US had a FDI stock of nearly 12.9 per cent,  UK 40.8 per cent, Germany 22.7 per cent, France 28.2 per  cent and Canada 30.4 per cent. Amongst developing countries,  Brazil had a FDI stock of 52.1 per cent in relation to GDP  and China had a stock of nearly 36.2 per cent. India stands  low with a ratio of 5.1 per cent. Admittedly, the ratio  of FDI to GDP is not by itself a clear determinant of economic  growth. That Brazil has a high ratio of FDI to GDP has not  made for robust and steady growth. India with 5.1 per cent  has not fared too badly in terms of growth compared to countries  with a much higher ratio. Critics of globalization have  a point in their favour when they stress that high FDI amounts  to shifting the location of decision-making outside the  countries. The fascination for FDI is justified by the impetus  to growth that it has conferred on countries, like China,  the US and UK. China has proved to be the most  powerful magnet for FDI in recent times. In 2002, China  attracted FDI of $53 billion, which was far in excess of  $30 billion, which poured into the US. Chinese economic  growth is partly the result as also the cause of the high  FDI. The World Investment Report  2003 makes a specific reference to the difference between  China and India in regard to FDI flows. In its view, Chinas  high FDI reflects its better infrastructure as also a more  pragmatic approach to foreign investment compared to Indias.  China opened its borders to foreign investment earlier than  India. FDI flows to China increased from $3.5 billion in  1990 to nearly $53 billion in 2002, whereas FDI flows to  India were a lowly 0.4 billion in 1990 before the onset  of liberalization.  What is more significant is that  FDI flows into China have contributed to the rapid increase  of Chinas merchandise exports at an annual rate of 15 per  cent between 1989 and 2001. In 1990, foreign affiliates  accounted for less than 9 per cent of Chinas total merchandise  exports, while in 2002, they accounted for nearly half.  In exports from hi-tech industries, foreign transnational  companies of China contributed much more: 91 per cent in  electronic circuits and 96 per cent in mobile telephones. FDI in Indian manufacturing has  been mostly confined to seeking the domestic market. Even  today, FDI accounts for only 10 per cent of Indias manufacturing  exports. This reflects different emphases on the strategic  approach to FDI in India and China. It may be significant  that China has opened its retail markets to multinational  organizations, such as Wal-Mart. The FDI advocates in India  feel we also should follow suit. Among the major contributory factors  for higher FDI in China are the presence of educated labour  and better labour conditions. China has also well-developed  natural resources. The emphasis of Chinese authorities on  developing physical infrastructure over the years, particularly  in respect of power, transport and ports, has led to more  propitious conditions for export manufacturers and hence  FDI.  The rapid economic growth in China,  both in rural and urban areas, has also increased domestic  demands for consumer goods. The World Investment Report  2003 notes that China in comparison to India has demonstrated  a more business-oriented attitude to FDI, making its procedures  easier and taking quick decisions. China has more flexible  labour laws, a better labour climate and easier entry and  exit procedures. These have all ultimately contributed to  Chinas attracting substantial FDI. China has the advantage of an  earlier start in regard to attracting FDI flows. It happened  to open its doors to FDI at a time India was closing its  doors. India started tightening regulations on entry of  foreign investment just 30 years ago. In the late Seventies,  it also dramatically threw out IBM and Coca-Cola. But China  took a leap forward from communism to an open-door policy  for FDI. We must recognize that the Chinese  economic strategy has been holistic. It is not confined  only to a pragmatic approach to FDI. Chinas national policies  have also been growth-oriented. Wherever FDI helped this  cause, it was encouraged. China delegates its powers of  approval of FDI to local organs, such as townships and provincial  governments, while India concentrates authority at the Centre.  Chinas capacity to take speedy decisions is also reflected  in its sharp turnaround of strategy from an ideology-based  closure of all avenues to foreign investment to opening  the doors with emphasis on national priorities. One instance of the Chinese approach  to FDI is the Boeing story. In the early Nineties, China  offered to buy a large number of Boeing jets. China has  now become the outsourcing centre for Boeings manufacture  of its plane. Boeing exports jet plane parts and jet planes  from China to the rest of the world. Transfer of technology  came hand in hand with huge investments in response to a  skilful procurement decision.  Similarly, China negotiated with  IBM to set up a plant in the country. It is not for nothing  that the eminent Indian economist, K.N. Raj, is stated to  have remarked in 1985: It is certainly not without good  reason that China has chosen to be hospitable even to markets  with worldwide ramifications, like IBM, evidently in the  expectation of securing the know-how for building up a semi-conductor  industry of its own. Those who do not realize the implications  of all this for India are living in a dream world. These  comments show that blind opposition to FDI does not pay,  while a constructive approach to FDI can help the national  objective of growth with equity. FDI flows into India have slowly  risen to $5.1 billion in 2002 from a low of $379,000 in  1990. During the same period, China showed an increase from  $3.4 billion to $52.7 billion. The share of foreign affiliates  has also increased substantially in China compared to India. FDI is attracted by many factors.  India has to take a conscious step towards making the country  an attractive destination for FDI through clear policies  on infrastructure, human development and incentives and  implementation of these.  The World Investment Report  2003 provides a picture of the incentives offered by  different countries to attract FDI. These countries keep  their national perspectives in mind when dealing with transnational  companies. The success of FDI policies lies in such a fine  balancing act. Let us hope that in the increasing pragmatism  shown by the Indian government, there will be a greater  attention to attracting FDI.

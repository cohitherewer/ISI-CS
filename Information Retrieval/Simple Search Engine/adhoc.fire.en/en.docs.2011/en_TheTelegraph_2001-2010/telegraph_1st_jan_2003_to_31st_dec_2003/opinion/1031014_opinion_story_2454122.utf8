		 Tuesday, October 14, 2003  THIRD CHANCE FOR THE THIRD FRONT
 The failure of the Congress and the  BJP to integrate most regional parties could signal a rebirth  of the third front, argues Mahesh Rangarajan The author is an independent political  analyst and researcher Memories of another  day  Is there any chance at all for  a third alternative on the political landscape? The auguries  are mixed and the future of such a formation uncertain.  But it can no longer be ruled out. Events in northern and  western India point to the real possibility of a third front  re-emerging in Indian politics. The key factor working in  favour of such a realignment is that there are large regions  or sections of the body politic that are not fully integrated  into the formations headed by Sonia Gandhi and Atal Bihari  Vajpayee. Until now, the adroit management of contradictions  by the latter has not only propelled him into high office  but looks set to be the single greatest factor working in  his favour in the run-up to the next general elections.  But the continued viability of  regional formations points to the fact that these forces  can grow stronger the moment both the larger parties look  more vulnerable. This is precisely what happened in 1996,  though that exact course of events is unlikely to repeat  itself. The Bharatiya Janata Party has come out of the near-total  isolation it suffered in the immediate aftermath of the  demolition of the Babri Masjid. The Congress too is busy  preparing to take power rather than lick its wounds after  a bruising electoral defeat as was the case in 1996. But for a variety of reasons,  the possibility of a third front cannot be wished away.  Such a development would belie the assertion of many commentators  that the Indian polity is now fully or almost fully polarized  along one fault line. You are either with the BJP or the  Congress. Or else you are out of the picture.  This is a line of thought that  appears to be validated by the way the votes get divided  up as in the recent vote of confidence in Parliament. It  will get further empirical grounding as the campaign for  the four assembly elections in northern India gets under  way. The problem is that this rather  simple reading breaks down once the ground realities are  examined. Regional gaps in the support base of the larger  all-India parties are actually so commonplace that their  consequences are not given due attention. Neither major  national party rules in Uttar Pradesh, the countrys most  populous state. Neither can hope to rule in Bihar, West  Bengal or Tamil Nadu in the foreseeable future.  In much of the Hindi belt, including  the four states going to polls, all eyes are on what the  Bahujan Samaj Party does next. Indications are that it will  for a time be a bitter adversary of the BJP. Rallying round  its leader, Mayavati, as she fights her way through the  courts, it may well enter into a closer engagement with  the Congress, especially in central and northern India.  The now ailing Kanshi Ram has often said that his party  will work with the B-team of the manuwadi parties  against the A-team. There is no second-guessing that it  is the Congress that is a distant second in todays India.  While the BSPs own track record  suggests that no one can predict where it will be even a  year from now, this is not the case with other key players  in the anti-BJP camp. Each has a different set of reasons  for refusing to unite under the banner of the Congress in  a pre-poll pact. But the net result is that these disparate  groups may be driven to establish some loose coordination  with each other. This will have two advantages. It will  not surrender the entire anti-Hindutva space to the  Congress. Further, it will enable them to possibly emerge  as a strong lobby in the post-election phase. Depending  on how things turn out, they may play kingmaker or, if the  situation warrants, a queen-breaker. A union or even a tactical  alignment of the Congress and the BSP will actually have  the effect of distancing the former from Mulayam Singh Yadav.  In fact, the upshot of the crackdown on Shiv Sena activists  by the Samajwadi Party-led coalition in Ayodhya only deepens  the coming competition between the regime and the Congress  for the support of the religious minorities. There is little  doubt in anyones mind that the Samajwadi Party sees itself  as the new ruling hegemon in Lucknow and that the road to  Delhi lies through Lucknow. In fact, this will create more  space for closer ties between Mulayam Singh Yadav and the  Nationalist Congress Party. The latter has the financial  resources to offer a platform to Congressmen disgruntled  with Sonia Gandhis leadership or the denial of tickets  in the forthcoming assembly elections. In Chhattisgarh,  V.C. Shukla has already shown that he can chip away at the  Congress leaders support base at the local level even if  his vote-catching abilities are unproven. The Congress in  turn will watch what happens next very carefully. After  all, in a state where the difference between winner and  loser is less than one per cent, a strong third force can  tip the scales in the BJPs favour.  Few would bet on the NCP-Congress  alliances chances of going into the next elections with  a unified platform either at the assembly or the Lok Sabha  level. If Sharad Pawar manages to hold his party together,  it will again play the spoiler in a clutch of states crucial  to the Congress: Maharashtra, Goa, Chhattisgarh and Meghalaya.  These states total 66 Lok Sabha seats and in a fight for  the spot of the single largest party in the house, they  may make all the difference.  Equally significant though easy  to miss out is the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka. It  has displaced the BJP as the premier opposition player.  With the continuing spate of farmers suicides, now over  the 250 mark, former prime minister, H.D. Deve Gowda, has  been attracting considerable crowds in the rural hinterland.  The Congress led by S.M. Krishna is no pushover, but a semblance  of unity among the warring Janata factions often makes them  formidable on the ground.  Due to its different assessment  of the situation, the Left Front is unlikely to help coalesce  such a front. A large section of its leadership feels this  may play right into the hands of the BJP, which it considers  a key ideological adversary. But the left mainly faces a  Congress-led opposition in at least two of its three bastions,  Tripura and Kerala. Were the BJP to slip well below the  present 183 mark, the left would be in a position to do  business with a loose third front formation. All this brings us to the question  of questions, namely the consequences for the premier opposition  party. If the Congress were stronger, it would be able to  bind and unify allies against the ruling combine. But its  continuing vulnerability as well as the all-too-real ground-level  conflicts of interest with other parties prevents it from  consolidating the anti-National Democratic Alliance vote  in one pool. Having the most inexperienced leader in its  history at the helm will also not help it deal with regional  satraps who have fought their way to the top. Satraps would  play a waiting game than surrender their options to a member  of the Gandhi-Nehru family.  But that is to get ahead of the  story. At the present juncture, the possibility of a third  front is more remote than in 1996 but not as distant a prospect  as it was during the last general elections. The Congress  is a newcomer to the art of alliances and coalitions. It  is only natural there will be other aspirants who have swum  in these waters for much longer. Who the third front really  harms most, the Congress or the BJP, will be worth watching.

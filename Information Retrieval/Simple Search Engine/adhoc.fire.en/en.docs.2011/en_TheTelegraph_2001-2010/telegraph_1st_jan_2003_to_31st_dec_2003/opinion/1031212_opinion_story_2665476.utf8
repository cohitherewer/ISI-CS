 Mita Ghose																								Charlie Johnson in the Flames By Michael Ignatieff, Chatto amp; Windus,  7.95																								Ignorance is bliss. Particularly, if you are keen on reading this novel without having your hopes dashed. It is best if you didnt know, for instance, that its author, Michael Ignatieff, is an academic at Harvard University, an authority on the Serbo-Bosnian war, has erudite tomes on the subject to his credit, and has had his earlier book, Scar Tissue, short-listed for the Booker. 																								You could then jettison your expectations and accept Charlie Johnson in the Flames for what it really is  a tale of revenge which falls short of being a satisfying suspense drama. War correspondent, Charlie Johnson, is witness to a carnage in a village on the Serbo-Bosnian border  a young Bosnian woman doused in gasoline and set on fire by the commander of a Serbian patrol. Once the perpetrators of this heinous crime are out of sight, Johnson tries to save her life. He fails. 																								Johnson is so haunted by the experience that after returning home, he provokes his editor to sack him and proceeds back to Bosnia to track down the war criminal he has been unable to forget. Johnson is no idealistic newcomer to the tragic fallout of combat, charged though he is with righteous rage and noble intent. He is middle-aged and cynical, having witnessed war-time brutality. But this episode leaves him shaking from head to foot  He is not in love with the murdered woman, had not even exchanged a word with her. So, why the sudden inspiration to play rebel with a cause? That the author himself is not terribly convinced about the basic premise on which the plot turns, is apparent in sentences such as the following: He didnt care about revengeWhat he cared about was the burning woman and, for her sake and for his, going through to the very end, wherever it was, no matter what. 																								Waffling of this kind is inevitable when the plot is limping along. The difficulty is compounded, one suspects, by the authors intention to live up to his academic credentials and produce something more than a thriller, perhaps, a war document of sorts. Between intent and achievement, however, lies a deep chasm.																								Yet the book does have its moments. Ignatieffs keen powers of observation and his special feel for the language, when he knows and cares about what he is describing, lend a raw edge to certain scenes. His heart is not always in this novel though, and consistency takes a beating along with credibility. 																								Revenge themes, when handled by a gifted writer, can leave an indelible impression. Why Ignatieff falters is clear in the relationship between the avenger and the victim in whose memory he seeks violent justice. In all fairness to the writer, however, we reserve a smidgeon of curiosity for what happens when Charlie finally catches up with his prey. In the interest of future readers, let that remain undisclosed. 						MITA GHOSE

		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 				 SURVIVING THE MALE GAZE
 Violence against women can be curbed only if there is a change in the way men look at women and women look at themselves, writes Uddalak Mukherjee				 	 Just claims																								Recently, villagers in Burdwan, led by members of the mahila samiti of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), assaulted and then stripped one Sujata Samant, allegedly for having an illicit relationship. Despite our acceptance of such regular incidents, this one is different. It proves that the perpetrators of violence against women are not necessarily men. Which means men, and women, perceive women in a particular way, making them vulnerable to such action. The incident, coincidentally, preceded the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25, a day on which womens organizations, members of the academia and several other advocacy groups deliberated at length on women and violence. At the end of the day, however, nothing much had changed. 																								Consider the following. On December 28, 2003, the Supreme Court pronounced that rape is an offence which violates the right to life. Earlier in November, it had issued notices to the Delhi government and the police commissioner on the rise of such incidents in Delhi. In July, it had ruled that a rape victims identification of culprits was to be held as conclusive evidence and need not be corroborated.																								These positive judgments, however, should not lead us to the conclusion that the movement to arrest violence against women has met with resounding success. Despite years of sustained dialogue, research and patient campaigning, very little difference has been made on ground zero. A large section of the Indian society, and even the judiciary, remains subservient to a patriarchal system. The failure of the court lies in its inability to implement its well-meaning judgments. Consequently, such verdicts turn into feel good manoeuvres. 																								Contemporary statistics lend credence to this picture of despondence. According to the National Crime Record Bureau (2000), 480 cases of crime against women are reported everyday. In 2003, Delhi witnessed a series of rapes in the city  the assault on a medical student at Khooni Darwaza, the rape of a Swiss diplomat at the Siri Fort auditorium, another assault on a student by presidential body guards. The incidents clearly prove that the only success of the pro-women and anti-violence campaigns has been in making the judiciary more open in acknowledging and admonishing incidents of violence against women. 																								There are many forms in which violence against women occurs  physical and sexual assaults, ritualistic mutilations, abductions, forced labour and so on. The causes are as varied as the act itself. Some researchers pin down the cause on genetics, socio-biologists talk about the influence of social and biological imperatives while Marxist-feminists point to the economic servitude of women. However, one main reason underlying this culture of violence is the manner in which women are perceived socially. The perception is augmented by patriarchal notions of possession or ownership of woman, which can be sexual or economic or both. The perception continues unchanged. So does the violence.																								In his seminal work, Ways of seeing, John Berger argues that born within a space defined by men, a womans success in life largely depends on how she is looked at by men. Berger uses one category of European oil painting  the nude  to consolidate his argument. Commenting on Vanity, a painting by Memling, Berger says that one painted a naked woman as one enjoyed looking at the subject. But by placing a mirror in her hand, she is condemned on moral grounds, although her nakedness was depicted for the artists own pleasure. Significantly, the subject of these paintings was always a woman, while the viewer was assumed to be a male. 																								Making the legal fraternity more gender sensitive and empowering women economically are the two most favoured lines of action to contain violence. However, all such measures will be negated unless men learn to look at women differently and understand the concept of femininity in a new light. In a recent seminar organized by the West Bengal Womens Commission, the state law minister, Nishitranjan Adhikary, observed that more than stringent laws, what is required is the presence of an understanding and empathetic legal authority. Empathy can often achieve what years of campaigning have not been able to do. 																								Activism like the White Ribbon Campaign in Europe might help. Started by a group of men who sought to break the complicity among men on the issue, the organization aims at raising male awareness. In India, such organizations may make a crucial difference in social perceptions. The recent campaign against violence against women, featuring Sachin Tendulkar, is a step in the right direction. A marriage of commerce and philanthropy can give the necessary boost.																								Our cultural mores, which promote the subservient image of women, need to change. Whether it is the saas-bahu soap on television, the projection of women in films or literature or clever advertisements, patriarchy reigns supreme in our lives. Getting rid of this dominant and rabidly insensitive psyche requires years of patient counselling, dialogue and censure.																								Most battles are won with tried and tested tools. The battle with the male gaze is no different. And here, education, more specifically sex education, is the best bet. There should be an effort to make children aware of gender blindness in human history, culture, politics, and suggest ways of fighting the skewed imagery of women. On a more specific level, sex education can be used not only to correct flawed notions of female (and male) sexuality, but also to change traditional ideas about interaction and exchange between the sexes. Socially prescribed gender segregation is unhealthy. It only leads to the creation of half-baked ideas about the self and the other, and a perverse sense of alienation which men counter by violently subjugating women. 																								There is a preconceived notion that the male gaze is set solely in the eyes of men. This is far from true. The majority of women do not look at themselves any differently from the way men do. Berger terms this as the problem of duality in a womans identity. While women know they are surveyed by men, their consciousness also imbibes a part of the surveyor. The prevalent cultural milieu socializes women to judge themselves within parameters exclusively defined by men. This impedes a change in collective perception. The solution lies in making women aware of this problem. This awareness can only be achieved through sustained campaigning, increasing literacy and economic empowerment. 																								Two things need to be kept in mind. These measures cannot guarantee that violence against women will stop. Neither can there be a time frame for achieving the goal. Yet, altering the male gaze can be a starting point for our collective transition from darkness to light.

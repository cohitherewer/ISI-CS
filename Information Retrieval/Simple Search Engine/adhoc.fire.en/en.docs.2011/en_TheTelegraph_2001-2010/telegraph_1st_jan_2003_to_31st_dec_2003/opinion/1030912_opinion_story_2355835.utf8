		 Friday, September 12, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																When Pinki gets into a trance Regime change (Penguin,   4.20) by Christopher Hitchens is a collection  of polemical articles on the Iraq war published in a couple  of online magazines and The Wall Street Journal. For  Hitchens, this war began when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait  in 1990, only a few months after the fall of the Berlin  Wall. Hitchens had then taken the side of the Iraqi and  Kurdish opposition to Saddam, hoping for their victory.  He portrays himself as remaining so now, and therefore firmly  on the side of Bush and Blair, against the bovine Europeans  and their anti-war piffle. 																												Between worlds: Travels among mediums, shamans and healers (Penguin, Rs 225) by Uma Singh is a disconcertingly credulous book about an alternative magico-religious reality based in the Ravi river valley. This is not an anthropological study, but a sharing of the authors amazing experiences among the beautiful people: Trance mediums and Gaardhis, practitioners of traditional magico-religious healing, are ordinary men and women, people of their times, yet painfully set apart from their society by virtue of inhabiting a separate reality, of being blessed  or cursed  with extraordinary powers of perception, divination and healing. There are pictures of Mahinder Singh going into a trance; during the trance, having pierced his tongue with a miniature trishul; after the trance, smoking a beedi, of Kishni drinking the blood of a sacrificial lamb, and of Pinki getting into a trance, helped by her father; and preparing to flagellate herself while in trance. A shockingly unnecessary book. The great arc (HarperCollins,   4.99) by John Keay is subtitled The dramatic  tale of how India was mapped and Everest was named. It  tells the story  very readably  of the Great Indian Arc  of the Meridian, the longest measurement of the earths  surface to have been attempted, which began in 1800 and  lasted for nearly 50 years. The survey was conceived by  William Lambton and completed by George Everest, through  hill and jungle, flood and fever, from the southern tip  of India up to the Himalayas. Light of the universe (Three  Essays, Rs 160) by Ashraf Aziz is a series of  short essays on singers, musicians and lyricists of Hindustani  cine-music and cine-song. This is an eccentric study of  the popular cultural forms taken by certain specific forms  of melancholy or griefwork in the songs of Noor Jehan  and Sajjad Hussain among others.

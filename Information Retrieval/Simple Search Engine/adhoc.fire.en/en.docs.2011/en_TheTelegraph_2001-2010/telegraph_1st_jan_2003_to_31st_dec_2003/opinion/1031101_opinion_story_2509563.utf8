The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, November 01, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Screen version				 																																																				Sir  Although Sunil Agnihotri has promised to abide strictly by Graham Stainess life, Bollywood film-makers are usually in the habit of distorting facts to suit their needs (Movie-maker zooms in on missionary murder, Oct 28). The liberties which Indian film-makers take when it comes to the question of drawing crowds is legendary. The Sanjay Leela Bhansali film, Devdas, is perhaps the best example of such an attempt in the recent past. A Hindi film devoid of masala seldom sets cash registers ringing. Which is why, Gladys Staines be warned, Agnihotri may never be able to live up to his promise. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S. Gupta, Calcutta

				 																Health concerns				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph has questioned why the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, paid a visit to Sourav Ganguly, but did not consider it his duty to visit the families of either Susmita Biswas and Shabana Parveen (Chief minister calls on Sourav, Oct 21). But Bhattacharjees was a courtesy call on a celebrity. And anyway, why should Bhattacharjee go visiting families just because the media wants him to?				 																																																				The chief minister has done enough on his part. Immediately on receiving the inquiry report in Biswass case, Bhattacharjee publicly admitted to the negligence on the part of the Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital authorities and assured punishment for those responsible for the death. He has also met the Biswases and dealt with them amiably. All these are testimony to his sense of moral responsibility and intention of ensuring a clean and effective administration. The media should not distort news.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Badal Pradhan, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Indias performance in the Mohali test against New Zealand made it clear what Sourav Ganguly means to the team. The bowling was ordinary, fielding terrible and batting shameful with minor exceptions. The Indians looked clueless and confused. Luckily for India, V.V.S. Laxman came to the rescue. But it was on Gangulys insistence that he had been included in the one-day squad. This match should serve as an eye-opener for all Ganguly-detractors who had questioned his ability as a captain.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anagh Pal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The lapse in medical attention that forced Sourav Ganguly into the hospital and surgery is inexcusable. Such callousness could have been expected when there was not enough technical and financial support for the game. Perhaps the Board of Control for Cricket in India should pay more attention to the medical facilities for cricketers. An independent arrangement could be made by the cricketers themselves where a team of reknowned doctors would attend to them as and when required. The sports ministry should look into the matter. Jagmohan Dalmiya should also utilize BCCI funds properly.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Sourav Gangulys commitment to cricket remains unparalleled. It would be good if The Telegraph could publish A normal day in the life of sports personalities also on a regular basis. This would help inspire youngsters.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shanku Sen, Calcutta

				 																Nobel choice				 																																																				Sir  The Nobel peace prize to Shirin Ebadi will inspire her to inculcate modern notions among her countrymen, thereby strengthening the hands of moderate and democratic leadership in Iran. Fundamentalist forces in Iran have found fault with the honour being bestowed upon her. In India too, a religious group suspected a Christian conspiracy behind the award of the Nobel prize to Amartya Sen. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Phani Bhusan Saha, 

				 																																																				Durgapur				 																																																				Sir  Atal Bihari Vajpayee should be considered for the Nobel peace prize. He has not only prevented the escalation of tension on the India-Pakistan border, he has proposed concrete plans to promote better ties. His attempts to tap the sentiment of the Pakistani people directly is a great diplomatic move.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.L. Tekriwal, Mumbai

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 04, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Learning to see throughUnderstanding power (Penguin, Rs 375) by Noam Chomsky collects seminars, talks, discussions, teach-in sessions and colloquies conducted by this linguist, philosopher and political activist. The aim of these transcriptions is to help people learn how to think critically for themselves, to unmask the workings and deceptions of powerful institutions in todays world. Two themes underlie every aspect of this collection: the progress of activism in changing the world, and the role of the media in staving off that activism, in shaping the way we think. This book is also something of a hypertext. Detailed annotations and documentary sources can be found, with numerous crucial links, at www.understandingpower.com. A short preface on 9/11 helps us understand how that event has made people like Chomsky and Bin Laden not only intellectually indispensable, but also commercially viable for thinkers and publishers. The black book of Gujarat (Manak,  Rs 295) edited by M.L. Sondhi and Apratim Mukarji  is an important collection of essays, reprints of newspaper  articles, reports and relevant government documents on the  post-Godhra genocide in Gujarat. Such books, even if they  tend to recycle journalistic writing and foster some indifferent  analysis, help to keep the collective amnesia regarding  Gujarat at bay. The cover design is rather lurid and could  put off serious readers. Waiting for rain (Penguin,  Rs 250) by Sirshendu Mukhopadhyay is Nilanjan  Bhattacharyas translation of Brishtir Ghran (1985),  set in Calcutta in the early Seventies, in the grips of  a torrid summer and of the Naxalite movement. Somsundar  is an unemployed boxer, Manju an affluent young woman, and  Adri her handsome and successful fianc. All three have  to make sense of their own lives before they can come to  terms with the strange times they live in. Travel writing and the empire (Katha, Rs 250) edited  by Sachidananda Mohanty is a purely academic collection  of essays on the imperial politics of travel as a mode of  assessment of territory, of knowledge gathering, and of putting  a discursive system into place. The introduction is a useful  survey of the state of the art in the politics of representation.  There are essays on Katherine Mayos Mother India,  Hajji Baba, Fanny Parkess journals, modern touring brochures,  Kannada travel fiction, and the Andaman cellular jail episodes  in the diaries of Charles Tegart.

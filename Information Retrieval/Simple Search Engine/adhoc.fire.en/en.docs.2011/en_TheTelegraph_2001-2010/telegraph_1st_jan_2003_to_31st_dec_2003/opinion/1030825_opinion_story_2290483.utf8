		 Monday, August 25, 2003  IS THE ECONOMY ON A ROLL?
 - If India believes it is on the upswing, it will be  COMMENTARAO / S.L. RAO The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission  raoslhotmail.com It is strange how the sentiment  about the economic prognosis can change so soon. Until about  a year ago there was gloom about the economic prospects.  We had seen the lowest growth of a decade, savings were  static, the monsoon had failed continuously for three years  (five in some parts of India), inflationary pressures were  increasing after many years, the tiger economy of China  was all set to decimate Indian manufactures with its cheap  products, there was no prospect for peace with Pakistan  or a decline in terrorist activity or a reduction in the  consequent high defence expenditures, the imminent invasion  of Iraq and the threats from top American officials of a  spread of American muscle into other countries like Iran  and Syria held out the possibility of further rise in oil  and gas prices, and the Central government seemed unable  to get its act together on many fronts. The deficits of  the Central and state governments continued to be high and  there was no sign that there were going to be economies  in government expenditures. Now the mood is different. The  National Council for Applied Economic Research reports the  highest level of business confidence in years. The Confederation  of Indian Industry promises that growth this year will cross  6 per cent (against earlier forecasts by many that it would  with luck approach 5 per cent). What are we to believe?  Should we keep swinging from gloom to euphoria with every  change in some indicators? Or can we find something more  fundamental about the economy that can help us to make a  better prognosis of the future? The monsoon is obviously a key  factor that affects sentiment. This is despite agriculture  contributing hardly 25 per cent to gross domestic product.  The reason is the 60 per cent or so who depend on it and  the fact that their incomes mostly go into consumption,  not saving, so that improvement in agriculture means a disproportionate  boost to consumption expenditure and hence to the economy.  The boost to agricultural production  because of a good monsoon will also curb inflationary pressures  from food and other agricultural products. Another factor  that has helped is the deterioration in the American economy  with deficits rising to extraordinary levels, interest rates  kept very low, a declining dollar and rising imports. This  has helped the rupee. It may also have led to considerable  inflows of funds into India seeking the better interest  rates and the security of a stronger rupee. The governor  of the Reserve Bank of India has said that there is reason  to expect this strengthening to continue. Indian industries  are now able to import as they need for their production  and invest overseas. The stronger Indian companies have  been able to borrow at low rates overseas and bring the  money back to India to earn better interest even after allowing  for the stronger rupee reducing the equivalent rupees. These  have helped exports and to fund foreign exchange inflows.  This arbitrage opportunity is  now being reduced because the government has imposed some  restrictions. But the American economic situation is unlikely  to change and the dollar decline may well continue. India  is today an attractive currency destination. Given our restrictions  on capital account convertibility, this is unlikely to be  hot or to be volatile in the short or even medium term  (two years). Our challenge is going to be to use these inflows  for productive purposes instead of letting them become a  burden. Since 1995 there has been little  addition to manufacturing capacity. The time is now right  for this to begin. The attractiveness of India as an investment  destination has led to foreign investors buying up existing  capacities but new investments, largely on a full control  basis in many areas, like automotive products and ancillaries,  information technology, pharmaceuticals, research and development  centres, and others, is likely to grow. Indias attractiveness  as an investment destination has been enhanced by the weaknesses  in southeast Asia, the SARS epidemic in China and southeast  Asia, the poor returns on investments in China as compared  to India and the fears about terrorists in many southeast  Asian countries. Indian companies are taking advantage of  this climate to raise equity funds overseas. This should  reflect in better responses to primary issues in India.  These have been very poor for many years and resulted in  poor capital formation and capital investment. The good corporate results have  been due to the savings in interest costs, better use of  working capital and significant improvements in costs of  inputs because of the last few years of exercises in introducing  information technology, supply chain management, and so  on. Now the demand situation will also improve and this  should lead to even better corporate results. We can confidently  expect a boom in industrial production in the coming years.  This will be helped by exports as companies cash in on the  nurturing of export markets of the last few years. Further, interest costs will continue  to decline, being much higher in real and nominal terms  than in most other countries. The banks are awash with liquidity  and need lower interest rates to compete with companies  who are going overseas or directly to investors for funds.  This will have beneficial effects both on consumption (because  of cheaper loan funds) and on investment. Again the economy  will benefit. The government appears at last  to have got its policies on disinvestments and the role  of the private sector in better shape than it was. This  has helped the stock market, as has the considerable improvement  in the performance of nationalized banks and many public  sector companies. Despite this, the privatization of state  owned companies appears to be making headway. There is also the puncturing of  the China competition balloon. Chinese products have made  little dent in Indian markets. Indeed many Indian companies  are now going to China for the cheap inputs and labour costs.  They are welcomed because of the technology and engineering  skills that they take there. This is making these companies  competitive not only in China and India but also in global  markets. The last year has also seen other  changes that account for the euphoria about the future.  The prospects of another war with Pakistan have dimmed greatly.  Terrorism across the border appears to be in decline. There  seems to be a general improvement in India-south Asia relationships  as evidenced by the progress with Sri Lanka and Nepal and  the possibility that the Bangladesh fears and suspicions  about India might be on the wane.  Indias relationships with the  rest of the world also appear to be on a much better plane.  There seems to be acceptance that India is a nuclear power  with strong missile and space capability developed by it.  The improvement in relations with Israel augurs well for  further improvement in relations with the United States  of America. Thus it is the culmination of  many initiatives that seem to be fructifying together. The  riots in Gujarat, communal killings, the mosque-mandir  controversy, do not seem to have affected the confidence  adversely. There is another intangible factor and that is  the role of the president. For the first time we have a  president who truly believes that India is a great country,  that it will be a developed nation by 2020, that it has  a great people with enormous intellectual capital who can  make good use of technology to develop the nation. His willingness  to repeat this mantra ad nauseam may be having an  effect in improving the confidence and feel good attitudes  of the majority of Indians. So is India on a roll? Euphoria  is not a good thing because it can be dashed by small setbacks.  India has always had many things going for it. They have  all come together today. People need to be made aware of  the good things that are happening while trying to correct  the bad. Positive attitudes will lead us to development  and growth. If we feel we are on the upswing we will be  so.

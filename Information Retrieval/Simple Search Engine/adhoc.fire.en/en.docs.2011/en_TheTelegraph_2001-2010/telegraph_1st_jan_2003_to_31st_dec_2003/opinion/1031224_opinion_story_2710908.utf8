		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 PARTY POOPER
																								Class, it is said in cricket, is permanent, while form is temporary. Following this, it can be said that for the fate of a political party the organization is permanent, and defeats in election are temporary setbacks. Unfortunately for the Congress, debacle and organizational disarray have come to be mixed up. The fiasco over the resignations by some important officials only highlights this. It is clear that after being routed in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, the party is completely demoralized and rudderless. The problem is that even the captain of the Congress ship is not particularly certain about which direction to take the party. Those who are familiar with the culture of the Congress will find it difficult to believe that important party officials resigned voluntarily and took upon themselves the moral responsibility of the election defeats. Ms Sonia Gandhi evidently has plans to restructure the party, but does not know quite how to go about it. Support for all her plans for revamping the party may not be forthcoming because it is almost impossible to see her anymore as the partys winning ticket. It is equally true that the Congress faces the proverbial Hobsons choice since there is no other leader in sight. The party is thus somewhat stuck with a leader who leads not by the command of her own achievements and personality, but on claims that originate in the family to which she belongs by marriage.																								The absence of leaders may appear to be somewhat paradoxical. The Congress still has important regional leaders: Mr S.M. Krishna in Karnataka, Mr Digvijay Singh  despite his defeat  in Madhya Pradesh; Ms Sheila Dikshit in Delhi. But these satraps have been deliberately confined to being regional satraps. Over the Gandhi familys control of the Congress looms the shadow of the old Congress regional leaders who formed the Syndicate. Ms Gandhi has centralized powers in her own hands and in the hands of her chosen office-bearers; she has also allowed regional satraps to flourish without allowing them to acquire any importance in the party organization. Genuine political influence and the party organization, manned by political lightweights, have gone in two different directions. Ms Gandhi has appealed to her party to prepare for early polls. But she has not clarified around what issues the preparation will take place. It is also not clear if the Congress intends to fight alone or with allies. These uncertainties can hardly be conducive to preparation for the polls. Ms Gandhi has still not recognized the reality of moving from being the nations number-one party to being just another political party.

		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 PRICE OF SUCCESS
																								The North Block and the Reserve Bank of India have toasted Indias foreign exchange reserves crossing the $100 billion mark. These are reserves rather than forex assets, and thus include gold and special drawing rights. But SDR holdings are minimal, and gold holdings do not exceed $4 billion. Foreign exchange assets have thus crossed $96 billion, and this is remarkable for a country that was stuck with just $1 billion in January 1991 and had to pledge gold so as not to default. Reserve accretion is but one symptom of success in the external sector, which is where reforms have been introduced seriously. The composition of Indias foreign exchange assets is a secret. But since assets are held in several currencies, cross-country exchange rate movements also affect the reserve figure. With the reserve figure expressed in dollars, dollar deprecation has certainly contributed to accretion. In 2002-03, the RBI estimated such valuation gains to be of the order of almost $4 billion. Having said this, riches are also proving to be an embarrassment. Any appreciation in nominal value of the rupee is certain to hurt exports, since Indias exports are in low-value segments and are therefore price-sensitive. In fact, rupee appreciation is blamed for the slowdown in export growth in 2003-04. The RBI does intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilize the exchange rate, interpreted as cushioning volatility.																								However, on the secular trend, the RBI intervention has been designed to ensure that the rupee does not appreciate against the dollar, barring a few occasions. This requires the purchase of dollars. The resultant rupees pumped into the system can fuel inflation. Central banks are normally cautious. That apart, inflation projections are between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent now and in election mode, the government will not contemplate any increments to this trend rate. It is a separate matter that some inflation is due to energy price increases, thanks to global crude prices increasing, and these cannot possibly increase further. In an attempt to prevent rupees being pumped into the system, the RBI has been selling government securities in return. Recently, an internal RBI committee was set up to examine a special problem that the RBI now confronts. The RBI is running out of government securities. Attempts to stimulate dollar-demand by lending to the International Monetary Fund, prepaying external debt and more capital-account convertibility are indeed possible. But unless exports, foreign institutional investments and private remittances taper off, excess dollar supply will not disappear. The oft-quoted Goldman-Sachs report on Brazil, Russia, India and China (2003) mentions the possibility of rupee appreciation. As economies develop, it becomes impossible for Central banks to deviate from long-term, market-determined exchange-rate levels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, July 11, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Why we need to rememberThe Gujarat carnage (Orient  Longman, Rs 425) edited by Asghar Ali Engineer  is an important and useful anthology of essays, editorials,  newspaper articles, reports and memoranda on the post-Godhra  genocide in Gujarat. Proper documentation of what actually  happened in Gujarat has now become an urgent need, given  that the judicial proceedings are proving to be far from  establishing the facts of the case. With this crisis of  evidence in mind, it might be a better idea to actually  prepare more fact-finding reports, record witness testimonies  (in various media) and put together an archive of primary  materials, rather than putting together opinions and analyses  from the press, much of which can already be found in other  such collections. Most of the writing here is justifiably,  and often very eloquently, impassioned. But the last section  of reports, prepared by the NHRC, Syeda Hameeds panel and  other individuals, together with the interviews and surveys,  is what is needed most.  The faces and other stories  (Indialog, Rs 195) by Dibyendu Palit is Santanu  Sinha Chaudhuris translations of a set of stories, mostly  set in Calcutta. Ashish Nandys foreword presents Palit  as a chronicler of the passions, pathos, trivialities and  extraordinariness of the ordinary. Palit is a psychologist  of a city, a city which has not lost touch with communatarian  experiences, and in which the slum is only on the other  side of the street; you can walk into it as easily as you  can walk out of it. The quality of the translation, particularly  the rendering of Bengali syntax into English, is rather  erratic. A problem from hell: America  and the age of genocide (Flamingo,  9.99) by  Samantha Power examines the Bosnians eradication of  non-Serbs, the Ottoman slaughter of the Armenians, the Holocaust,  Pol Pots terror in Cambodia, Saddam Husseins destruction  of Kurds in northern Iraq and the Rwandan Hutus systematic  extermination of the Tutsi minority. Each provided the US  with options for meaningful diplomatic, economic, legal  or military intervention. But Power concludes that despite  graphic media coverage. American policy-makers, journalists,  and citizens are extremely slow to muster the imagination  needed to reckon with evil. It is in the realm of domestic  politics that the battle to stop genocide is lost. No US  president has ever made genocide prevention a priority,  and no US president has ever suffered politically for his  indifference to its occurrence. It is thus no coincidence  that genocide rages.

																								What is it about political correctness that brings out the blackest parody from the nicest people? Two Canadian medics have published, in a serious medical journal earlier this week, an article, which is an entertaining send-up of north American PC. In high-minded medico-ethical jargon, they uncover evidence of a dangerous subtext in childrens literature. Six famous nursery rhymes exhibit a range of highly questionable responses to brutal head injuries in children: from evident glee to passive indifference. Most notably, Humpty Dumpty, Hush-a-bye-baby and Jack and Jill portray head injuries as inevitable events that do not require medical follow-up. The writers question whether all the kings horses and all the kings men were at all capable of launching an appropriate medical intervention after Mr Dumptys unfortunate accident. They invoke the Child Protection Services in the second case. And they also wonder whether the scanty documentation of Jills injuries (compared to that of Jacks) when she came tumbling after him, is yet another case of medical discourse excluding women.																								What provokes this parody is the facile thinking and theorizing behind such concerns  the meddlesome worry that children learn quite directly from what they read and watch, and then grow up into damaged and abusive adults. Such simple-minded fears about childrens inability to distinguish between fact and fiction have led, for instance, to the tabooing of dear old Enid Blyton from that haven of gloom, the English nursery. (Such purgings have, in turn, inspired many modern childrens writers to write particularly nasty versions of rhymes and tales for the proper delectation of their young readers.) Nearer home, the Union human resource development minister wants to ban violent toys  guns, but presumably not the epic maces, tridents and chakras  to prevent the corruption of the national Gandhian genes. This concern is not merely paediatric. Ms Sushma Swaraj and her successor in the information and broadcasting ministry firmly believe in the ill effects, on the adult Indian male, of seeing too many French kisses and letters on television, and frame their policies on sexual health and censorship accordingly. The real causes of violence  for which the state will have to take a different kind of responsibility  are thereby obscured by archaic notions of moral education.																								The kill-joy earnestness and puritanism of north American political correctness are, at best, very funny, and often inspire the most delightful irreverence. But there is also something insidiously dangerous in the simple belief that all the embarrassing, disturbing and disagreeable things in the world are somehow dealt with or even resolved, once and for all, by just using another set of nicer, fairer or politer words to describe them. Calling the blind visually challenged or a brutal war regime change somehow spirits away the tragedy of the one and the brutality of the other. They are both thus made easier to live with. Language is often the easiest thing to clean up.

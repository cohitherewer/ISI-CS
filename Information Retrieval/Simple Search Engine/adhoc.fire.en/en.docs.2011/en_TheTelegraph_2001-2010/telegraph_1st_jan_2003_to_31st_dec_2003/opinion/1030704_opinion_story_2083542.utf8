 - India needs to prepare itself intellectually to benefit  from strategic partnerships  BRIJESH D. JAYAL The author is a retired air marshall  of the Indian air force The recent visit of the deputy  prime minister to the United States of America received  extensive media coverage and comment within this country.  However, little was said on his scheduled visit to the Rand  Corporation, a prestigious think tank on counter-terrorism  and security issues near Los Angeles, and his planned meeting  with members of council of foreign relations, an influential  think tank based in Chicago. Not surprising, since the  culture in India is far removed from that of the US, where  such institutions play a crucial role in providing independent  input into national policy formulation. Here, inputs to  policy formulation are zealously guarded ministerial turfs,  cloaked in secrecy in the general belief that anyone outside  of the government machinery has a vested interest. The Rand Corporations stated  mission is to help improve policy and decision-making through  research and analysis. While Rands work today is diverse,  from the military standpoint it is interesting that the  US air force created it in 1946 as its first client and  Rand continues to assist all branches of the US military  community to this day. In a land where research institutions  are in abundance, Rand also has the distinction of being  the first to be billed a think tank.  Over the years, many research  papers on security-related matters pertaining to India have  been published under Rands umbrella. The late George Tanham,  a one-time vice-president of Rand, was a regular visitor  to this country and had written extensively on Indian security  issues. In 1992, he published a paper called Indian strategic  thought  an interpretive essay.  This analysed various factors  influencing Indian strategic thinking and how Indias past  had shaped its concept of military power and national security.  In 1995, he co-authored another report, The IAF: trends  and prospects, which was sponsored by the US air force  as part of its larger effort to examine air forces in a  range of important nations to see how they viewed the role  of air power in support of their national security. This  was prompted to a large degree by the overwhelming success  of air operations during the 1991 Kuwait war.  In January this year, C. Christine  Fair published a paper titled Military operations in urban  areas  the Indian experience, in which she postulates  that despite Indias considerable experience with conducting  military operations on urbanized terrains, there is little  evidence that India is adopting a formal MOUT doctrine.  She further concludes that within the force structure, Indian  institutions have generally been unable to absorb and disseminate  the various lessons learnt from these operations and that  there are few, if any joint mechanisms, to ensure that Indias  entire security apparatus can draw from accumulated operational  knowledge. To those in the US security establishment,  tasked with formulating strategy and policies towards India,  it is a pre-requisite to understand the Indian security  establishments ethos, strengths and weaknesses. Institutionally,  this is done through the medium of commissioned studies  by independent research organizations. Of late there has  been a convergence of security perceptions between the US  and India. This has led to the commencement of a dialogue  towards a strategic partnership.  In furtherance of this, not only  will the US establishment be looking at past studies but  commissioning new ones as well. One such report has recently  been in the news. This highly classified report commissioned  by the US department of defence is titled Indo-US military  relations: expectations and perceptions. It has been prepared  by an associate at Booz Allen Hamilton and is reportedly  being distributed to select policy-makers. Notwithstanding  its security grading, a dotcom has run a series of articles  quoting extensively from this report. It is not the purpose of this  piece to look at the contents of this document or indeed  the possible reasons why a highly classified document should  so easily find its way out of the US department of defence.  It is merely to highlight the importance given by various  US government departments to research papers on various  issues on which the administration would need to be formulating  strategies and policies. Such an open intellectual approach  to policy formulation has in turn led to many think tanks  in the US, many supported generously by the individual services  or government departments.  These think tanks in turn draw  on local and international intellectual pools by awarding  fellowships to scholars across the globe, thus ensuring  that the subjects being researched have the benefit of national,  cultural and intellectual diversity. In a wider context,  the practice of encouraging such research institutions through  financial and research support in turn breeds a whole new  generation of scholars and experts on issues related to  security, thus broadbasing discussion and debate and providing  it with greater intellectual depth. It also follows that those at  the receiving end of such research within the administration,  are themselves adequately educated in security and strategic  issues, apart from being professional military men or civil  service specialists. Only then can efforts of such research  be meaningfully analysed and synergized with national security  objectives towards effective policy formulation. The American  system ensures this by educating its potential national  security leaders, both civil and military, in institutions  like the US National Defence University. Aptly, its mission  is to educate military and civilian leaders through teaching,  research, and outreach in national security strategy, national  military strategy, and national resource strategy. For the US, which has global interests,  there is little doubt that over the years administrations  have been studying India through the media of in-house research,  intelligence and diplomatic means and by commissioned research  studies. There is also little doubt that those contributing  to the current high-level Indo-US engagement are military  and civilians, institutionally educated in matters of strategy  and security. The question that we need to ask ourselves  is, how well are we in the Indian security and foreign policy  establishments prepared to ensure that this constructive  engagement is not a one-sided affair? That we are equally  well-prepared to extract the best bargain from our own national  security perspective, as indeed the Americans would want  to do from theirs? Institutionally, the Indian system  leaves little scope for optimism. While a few think tanks  predominantly privately funded do exist, they are woefully  few in number and most have very limited resources to conduct  research, leave alone afford the luxury of attracting bright  local and foreign scholars on fellowships. The armed forces,  steeped in their closed and vertical hierarchies, are not  traditionally open to outside comment. They certainly do  not sponsor any such institutions and they see the one,  which is supported by the ministry of defence, more as a  talk shop than a complementary tool towards policy formulation.  It is safe to assume that within the ministry of defence  and the ministry of external affairs, things are no different  with all inputs towards policy formulation being those generated  in-house.  The corollary is that the Indian  security and foreign policy establishments deny themselves  the benefit of researched inputs from independent sources  and consequently do not nurture and encourage such institutions.  In turn research scholars are not attracted to studies on  national security and foreign policies, which remain confined  to a few with the nation denied wider participation. The other drawback relates to  our inability to offer opportunities to educate our military  and civilian leaderships towards handling responsibility  in the strategic security domain. We continue with the philosophy  that administrators, diplomats and military commanders can  guide national security policy purely by virtue of seniority  and by happening to be in a specific post. Civil services  do not believe in the maxim of periodic in-service training.  The uniformed fraternity has excellent professional training,  but none at the defence university level to prepare them  for policy at the apex security level.  These weaknesses, which have for  long been felt, were proposed to be addressed by the setting  up of a defence university. This was the recommendation  of the group of ministers under the deputy prime minister  which reviewed various aspects of security management after  Kargil. Unfortunately, over a year after a special committee  submitted its report on the Indian national defence university,  it remains on paper. Today, when economic and security  issues are taking on a global dimension and when the country  is engaged in dialogue towards strategic partnerships with  many countries, the first challenge India faces is internal.  We need to prepare ourselves institutionally and intellectually  so that in this emerging world of strategic competition,  partnerships and choices, we are able to formulate policies  that promote national strategic interests and enable us  to negotiate from a position of strength. It is with this  in mind that one was heartened that the deputy prime minister  chose to spend time at two think tanks, normally ports  of call reserved only for academics.  During his current visit to the  US, the Indian air force chief is also scheduled to deliver  a talk at Rand. One can only hope that these welcome and  path-breaking departures are a precursor to some long overdue  institutional and attitudinal changes at home.

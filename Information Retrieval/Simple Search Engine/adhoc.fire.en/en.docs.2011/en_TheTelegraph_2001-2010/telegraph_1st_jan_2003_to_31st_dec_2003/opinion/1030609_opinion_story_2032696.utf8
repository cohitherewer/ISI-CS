 - Are Indias reserves securely invested in other currencies?  S. VENKITARAMANAN The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India Indias foreign exchange reserves  stand at an all-time high of more than $ 77 billion. Concerns  are, however, being expressed not only about the desirability  of a high level of reserves but also about the risks in  investing them in securities of countries, such as the United  States of America, whose currencies are depreciating. The  value of reserves will naturally decline if the currencies  in which the reserves are invested decline over time. This  is what some people fear is happening to Indias reserves. The US dollar has declined over  the last year by nearly 21 per cent against the euro and  14 per cent against a basket of other currencies. Assuming  for the sake of argument that Indias foreign exchange reserves  had been invested in the euro and not in the dollar, there  would have been a corresponding gain through exchange appreciation  of nearly 21 per cent. The dollar is, however, the effective  transaction currency for most exporters in India as also  for importers. The exports and imports of India are mostly  denominated in dollars. More important, Indias central  bank intervenes in exchange markets through the dollar.  It has, therefore, been convenient and practical if the  Reserve Bank of India were to invest its reserves in dollars.  It is, however, a fact that there is lack of transparency  about the currency composition of reserves  how much of  our nations stockpile of reserves is invested in specific  currencies. Concern about the danger of erosion  in value of our foreign exchange reserves has been widely  expressed. Recently, a concerned Mumbai citizen, R.P. Abrol,  who is involved in small-scale industries, rang me up and  expressed his concern over the effects of a declining dollar  on Indias reserves. Not being sure of how the reserves  are invested, he wanted to assure himself that the RBI is  doing the right thing in its investment policy. He felt  that the RBI should diversify its investment policy into  currencies other than the dollar, such as the euro, which  are strengthening. He has followed up with a letter to the  governor of the RBI, in which he was more direct in pointing  out the dangers of a run on the dollar. Abrol recalled experiences  with cooperative banks in India when the value of deposits  fell to literally nothing following the fall of confidence.  He wanted the governor to assure him and the public at large  that the RBI was following the right policies in regard  to safeguarding the value of the invested reserves. Much turns on the future prospect  of the greenback. The dollar has been declining over the  last year or so. This fall has been caused partly by the  declining strength of the USs balance of payments. The  USs current account  which represents the difference between  its exports of goods and services and its imports  has  been running at an annual level of $ 500 billion or 5 per  cent of the USs gross domestic product. There is no sign  of this gap diminishing. When there is such an unsustainable  current account deficit, it is inevitable that the currency  of the country, which runs the deficit, faces a decline  with reference to other currencies of the world. The surprise  is rather that this has not happened sooner and in a larger  measure than was visible last year. This phenomenon is generally  explained by the confidence of the rest of the world in  the strength of the American economy notwithstanding the  current decline in the dollar.  The Indian central banks policy  of investing its reserves in securities of countries like  the US is part of the general tradition of investing in  strong securities. In spite of the current account deficit,  the USs credit rating is at present unchallenged. But the  danger of a further decline in the dollar cannot be ruled  out. Given this state of affairs, it is only fair that the  RBI responds to concerns about the currency composition  of its reserves and comes out with a paper indicating the  deployment of its reserves and how it ensures that its composition  is optimum. It is conceded that it is part  of the central banking orthodoxy not to disclose the currency  composition of its reserve management. There is a fear that  this disclosure might itself affect the valuation of the  currencies of the countries in which the reserves are invested.  But, given the tendency of the dollar to decline, the RBI  needs to assure the Indian public that its policies are  sensibly designed. The best way this can be done is to have  a peer review by established experts in foreign currency  management and have their report published. While it is  true that the RBIs statutory auditors do audit its reserve  management policy, the audit is more from the point of view  of accounting standards and not from the point of optimality  of the composition of reserves with reference to the strength  or weakness of currencies. The current concern is heightened  by the recent statements of the secretary of the US treasury  about the dollar. While he declared himself at times to  be in favour of a strong dollar, he has also made a confusing  statement that a weak dollar will not hurt the US economy.  The markets went into a tizzy over this messy exposition.  Playing with exchange markets with such obtuse statements  is equivalent to playing with fire. The dollar went in for  a free fall, much to the discomfort of the competing nations,  like Germany, France and Japan. It is obvious the stronger  a currency becomes, the weaker the countrys competitive  strength in the export market. Taking into account the risks  a further decline in the greenback portends, there are various  ways in which the RBI can react. It can put more of its  reserves in the currencies, like the euro and the yen. It  can also adopt hedging tactics, although hedges of such  a large order may not be quite available in the markets.  Nor is it clear that the hedges will come cheaper. Hedging  is justified because it is a price to be paid for security.  The RBI will do well to explore various methods it adopts  for ensuring that the reserves are protected against exchange  variations with respect to its principal currency of investment. All this is relevant particularly  because there is a climate of increasing transparency. The  RBI is particularly a strong adherent of transparency. It  would appear reasonable to require that the RBI details  the measures it has taken so as to assure the public at  large that its investments are sufficiently diversified  and that they are protected against further erosion of the  greenback. I concede that the RBI may very well turn to  its critics and explain that facts prove that it has indeed  been quite prudent. The last review of the accretion of  reserves had taken credit for an increase of nearly $ 2  billion as a result of valuation change  which was the  result of exchange-rate variation. This happened over a  period of nearly eight months  April to November 2002   and that too on a base of reserves of roughly $ 60 billion,  which is the level of our reserves if we exclude gold and  special drawing rights.  The RBI may very well argue that  this order of revaluation gains is itself the result of  a prudent policy of investment. If all the reserves had  been invested in dollars, there would have been no gain  on account of exchange valuation with reference to the dollar.  This goes to show that the RBI has been quite successful  in implementing its reserve management policy. That the  RBI has been in touch with established foreign exchange  management experts of the world is yet another factor to  be borne in mind.  In these circumstances, there  should be no cause for hesitation on the part of the RBI  to disclose what may have turned out to be a successful  exercise for optimal reserve management. The least the country  expects from an efficient and transparent RBI is an assurance  that all necessary steps are being taken to protect the  nations nest-egg from unexpected or even expected decline  of value of the currency or currencies of investment. The  RBI will do well to respond appropriately to concerns such  of those expressed by Abrol. Such concerns should not be  spurned aside just because they have come from unimportant  or politically insignificant quarters. However arcane the  subject of foreign exchange management may be, the common  mans fears have a signalling role in keeping the RBI on  its toes. We should not have reason to feel later that timely  warning signals went unheeded. To be forewarned is to be  forearmed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, December 29, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Science of filling the gap Sir  Surely the supply of  scientists cannot be increased at will in the face of a  rising demand for them (Bid to replenish scientist stock,  Dec 27)? But if the government is capable of doing exactly  this, shaken out of its slumber just when about a third  of its scientists are due to retire, then it must be no  mean feat. Despite admitting that fewer students are opting  for basic sciences, the government thought it best to solve  the problem by setting up four national institutes of science  rather than making the necessary changes in the system of  education. Even if the newly established institutes are  successful in churning out young scientists, the fruits  cannot be reaped till a few years from now. And what chance  do they have, when reputed universities and institutes have  failed to fill the gaps in the scientific pool all this  time? While all the talk about investing in higher education  is fine, this is perhaps the time to remember that the real  investment must come in terms of quality.  Yours faithfully, 
 Kingshuk Ray, Calcutta
 Return of the prodigal  Sir  There are no permanent friends or enemies in politics. So the news that Kalyan Singh is sending out feelers to return to the Bharatiya Janata Party fold should not surprise. It goes without saying that Singhs was not just a courtesy call on the prime minister who was celebrating his 79th birthday. Uttar Pradesh politics is now at a curious juncture given the clash of interests between Kalyan Singh and Mulayam Singh Yadav. Singh has understood that it is as important for the BJP to win in Uttar Pradesh as it is for him to retain his foothold in the states politics. Yet without the BJP it is difficult for him to do that. The party and Singh need each other. After all, politics is the science of convenience. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  The former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Kalyan Singh, is apparently trying to patch up with the BJP. This is welcome news. Singhs proposed return, apparently, was planned by the prime minister himself. Atal Bihari Vajpayees statesmanship in making former saffronites return to the party is bound to make a difference to the partys tally in the elections. 				 																																																				The Congress has several such cases where veteran politicians have left the party to float their own outfits. The Congress president, unlike Vajpayee, lacks the sagacity to plan the home-coming of these members. Her sole attention is directed at her winning the prime ministers chair. Yet without boosting the partys strength by mending fences with former party members-turned opponents, this will be impossible. It will do the party a lot of good if Sonia Gandhi managed to think beyond her own interests. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

				 																																																				Sir  No matter how desperate Kalyan Singh is to keep his political fortunes intact, his likely return to the BJP cannot change the situation in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP, despite Singhs return, is not in a position to regain Uttar Pradesh. There is no doubt that Singhs Rashtriya Krantikari Party will better the margin of win in Atal Bihari Vajpayees constituency of Lucknow. But besides that, the move is unlikely to yield major dividends. Nevertheless, kudos to the BJP think tank for such futuristic thinking. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Free but unfair				 																																																				Sir  In a recent interview on television to a foreign news channel, the chief election commissioner, J.M. Lyngdoh attacked politicians, describing them as cancerous, and decrying them by saying that no politician in the country is committed to democracy and welfare of the people. He also reportedly declared that he would refuse official positions after retirement. Lyngdohs strength of character comes through his comments. The CEC has done an excellent job of building pressure on politicians and by assuring free and fair elections as part of the fundamental rights of the people. Criminality of politicians has been evident in the various scams that have occurred throughout this year and even before, Telgi being the latest. All of this shows how right Lyngdoh is in his insistence on the decriminalization of politics. One hopes that his successor follows in his footsteps. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  J.M. Lyngdoh overstepped his limits in a recent television interview with Karan Thapar. There is no doubt that as the chief election commissioner, he has done a fine job. But he should know where to draw the line. 				 																																																				Lyngdoh should have realized that all politicians cannot be painted with the same brush. Although the general trend is a lack of commitment, there are quite a few exceptions. Had Lyngdoh been as sincere as he professes to be, he would have found them. The CEC believes that democracy means freedom of the individual. But for a country with more than a billion population, that is impractical. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Muzaffarnagar				 																Civic worries				 																																																				Sir  A student has to study various subjects to know about the past and our world. But a subject that would inculcate civic sense, indispensable to daily living, is missing. A subject on civic problems and civic sense must be formulated to solve the problems faced by municipal authorities, the government and by ourselves.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sanjay Jain, Howrah

				 																																																				Sir  Making environment studies mandatory is not enough. Saving our planet requires more concrete action at the grassroots level. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

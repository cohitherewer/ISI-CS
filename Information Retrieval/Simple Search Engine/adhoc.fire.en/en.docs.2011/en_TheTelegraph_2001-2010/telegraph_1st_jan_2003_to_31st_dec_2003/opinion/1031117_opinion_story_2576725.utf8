Actions: (a) Take measures to ensure equal distribution of health and rehabilitation resources to older persons and, in particular, increase access for these resources for older persons who are poor and promote their distribution to poorly served areas, such as rural and remote areas, including affordable access to essential medications and other therapeutic measures; (b) Promote equal access to care for older persons who are poor, as well as for those who live in rural or remote areas by, inter alia, the reduction or elimination of user fees, provisions of insurance schemes and other financial support measures;...																								(f) Enhance the access of older persons to primary healthcare and take steps to eliminate discrimination in healthcare based on age and other forms of discrimination; (g) Utilize technology such as telemedicine, where available, and distance learning to reduce geographical and logistical limitations in access to health care in rural areas. 																								Objective 2: Development and strengthening of primary healthcare services to meet the needs of older persons and promote their inclusion in the process. 																								Actions: (a) Take measures to provide universal and equal access to primary healthcare and establish community health programmes for older persons; (b) Support local communities in providing health support services to older persons; (c) Include traditional medicine in primary healthcare programmes where appropriate and beneficial; (d) Train primary healthcare workers and social workers in basic gerontology and geriatrics; (e) Encourage, at all levels, arrangements and incentives to mobilize commercial enterprises, especially pharmaceutical enterprises, to invest in research aimed at finding remedies that can be provided at affordable prices for diseases that particularly afflict older persons in developing countries and invite the World Health Organization to consider improving partnerships between the public and private sectors in the area of health research. 																								Objective 3: Development of a continuum of healthcare to meet the needs of older persons. 																								Actions: (a) Develop regulatory mechanisms at appropriate levels to set suitable standards of healthcare and rehabilitation for older persons; (b) Implement community development strategies that determine a systematic needs assessment baseline for the planning, execution and evaluation of locally based health programmes...(c) Improve the coordination of primary health care, long-term care and social services and other community services;... 																								HIV/AIDS diagnosis among older persons is difficult because symptoms of infection can be mistaken for other immunodeficiency syndromes that occur in older persons. Older persons can be at increased risk of HIV infection merely because they are typically not addressed by public information campaigns and thus do not benefit from education on how to protect themselves. 																								Objective 1: Improvement in the assessment of the impact of HIV/AIDS on the health of older persons, both for those who are infected and those who are caregivers for infected or surviving family members. 																								Actions: (a) Ensure and expand the compilation of HIV/AIDS data to allow for the assessment of the extent of HIV/AIDS infection in older persons; (b) Pay special attention to older carers of HIV/AIDS patients, including the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data on the health status and needs of older carers.

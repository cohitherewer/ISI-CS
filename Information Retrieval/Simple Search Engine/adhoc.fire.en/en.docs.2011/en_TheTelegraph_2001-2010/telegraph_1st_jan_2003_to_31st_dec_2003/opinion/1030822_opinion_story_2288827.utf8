		 Friday, August 22, 2003 				 A DAY AT THE MOVIES 
																								Indian cinema is all about paradoxes, the biggest of them being, of course, that the entertainment of the poorest of the poor culls its plots from the lifestyles of the ricest of the rich. Jonathan Torgovniks photographic exploration of the motion picture industry and its culture in India, Bollywood Dreams (Phaidon, Rs 2,041), provides a glimpse of this world full of contradictions. The real treasures of the book are persons like the crew member of the Amar Touring Cinema, seen in the accompanying picture rewinding film reels between shows in a village, who act as catalysts between the rural audiences and the opulent reel world inhabited by the Shah Rukh Khans and Madhuri Dixits. Nasreen Munni Kabirs introduction places Indian cinema in context and gives a brief account of its origins and distinctive features. The dazzling gold of the cover warns that an excess of the tinsel world can give one a headache.

		 Tuesday, June 17, 2003  CHINAS HISTORIC FAILURE
 - China shares with many nations a weak-kneed response to  the US  Achin Vanaik The author is a political scientist  and has recently published the book, Communalism Contested:  Religion, Modernity and Secularization At a time when the United Nations  has obsequiously legitimized the American occupation of  Iraq and erstwhile opponents like France, Russia, Germany  and China have quietly gone along with this, it is hardly  surprising that the voices in India calling for it to accede  to the United States of Americas request for Indian troops  in Iraq have become much louder. Whatever lip service might  be paid by some governments to wanting a multipolar world  order, these very governments are falling over each other  to assure the US of their goodwill and support and, by doing  so, self-defeatingly strengthening the latters global hegemony.  The standard justification given for such surrender is that  governments need to pragmatically pursue their national  interests and that this demands that they not offend the  powerful and the temporarily victorious. Different governments and elites  only bring different levels of enthusiasm to this posture  of subordination. Some, like the Bharatiya Janata Party-led  government in India, are more likely to see (and be seduced  by) vistas of a highly fruitful strategic partnership;  others like France, Russia, Germany and China are more disturbed  than enthused by American power and its implications for  their own future. Though this is obviously a more sensible  response, it only highlights their own diplomatic-political  failings in being unwilling to stand up to the US, for without  doing this in subtle yet effective ways they cannot hope  to move out of this disturbing situation. Yet in many Indian circles Chinese  foreign policy behaviour, in particular, is seen as a model  of intelligent pragmatism worthy of being emulated. Where  New Delhi foolishly wasted years pursuing nonalignment and  thereby alienating the US, Beijings foreign policy realism  helped make it a growing global power, Surely the time has  come then to assess Chinas foreign policy over the last  decades to see just how much of a success it actually has  been. China never followed nonalignment  and therefore, unlike India, always had to face one or both  superpowers as a strategic opponent. It first allied itself  with the Soviet Union against the US, then was hostile to  both, and then from 1971 onwards hitched itself to the US  in an entente directed against the former Union of  Soviet Socialist Republics. It adopted this posture because  it believed that Soviet Social Imperialism was a bigger  regional and global danger than US power and aggrandizement.  Whatever local leverage it might  have got against its closer neighbour through this alignment  with the US, as a political assessment of the then existing  reality and future global trends, this was a monumental  mistake. Far from China playing a clever balancing game,  it so grossly overestimated Soviet power that after the  systemic collapse of communism in east Europe and the USSR,  it was put dramatically on the defensive by a US that could  now turn its strategic sights on China. The three basic goals of the Chinese  elite are modernization, national power enhancement and  national unity. Regarding the first, this is primarily determined  by domestic policy choices and practices and here the Chinese  record is certainly impressive. National power enhancement,  however, is a relative, not an absolute, term. It depends  not just on how strong militarily or economically China  is or becomes but to what extent through diplomacy it can  restrain strong outside challengers or eliminate tensions  with them, especially with the all-powerful US.  Here Chinas performance has been  poor. Its bilateral relationship with the US is far from  balanced. China is very much on the defensive. Its only  point of leverage is the attraction of its huge domestic  market to US producers and investors. But this has not prevented  the US from repeatedly humiliating the Chinese government  politically. The examples are numerous. During the build-up  to the Kuwait war in 1991 when the US wanted a UN cover  for its assault, China was told to abstain in the security  council or lose its most favoured nation status. China quietly  acquiesced.  In 1998, its embassy in Serbia  was bombed and all Beijing could do was engineer some mild  street protests. A spy plane violates its territorial sovereignty  but China can do little more than cause temporary embarrassment  to Washington before the latter is back in the driving seat  steering their bilateral relations. The premier of Taiwan  can be invited to the US overriding Chinese protests, as  also Chinese political dissidents who publicly embarrass  China over its dismal human rights record.  Worst of all, the military alliances  organized by the US in east Asia over several decades not  only all remain in place but US longer term military preparations  directed against China, most importantly the ballistic missile  defence programme, have qualitatively expanded. As for the pursuit of national  unity, that is to say the unification of Taiwan with the  mainland, this remains a distant prospect. If in 1971 when  China made its decisive turn towards the US, Mao Zedong  and the rest of the Chinese leadership had been told that  even after another 30 years there would be no such unification,  they would never have believed it. After all, one of the  central purposes of the entente then was to achieve with  American assent that very unity, if not immediately then  certainly in the course of some years, perhaps a decade  or so.  Instead, this remains the one  issue that can even lead to war between the two countries.  In 1996 the US sent in its navy to the Taiwan straits forcing  China, which had been militarily sabre-rattling, to fall  silent. The status quo that persists favours the  US. To the great frustration of China there is no timetable  or actual process that Taiwan must follow to formally and  practically become a part of the mainland. It can even continue  to make noises about wanting independence which the US will  not now endorse but which affords Washington an option that  it can more seriously explore if Sino-US relations in the  future do move more strongly and clearly in the direction  of strategic enmity. The brute reality is that China  does not know how to handle the US. It is desperate to assure  the US that it is not a strategic opponent but whether or  not it becomes one is not really contingent on its own behaviour,  but will be overwhelmingly determined by US ambitions to  be a global hegemony and how it feels it must prepare for  this geo-politically. Chinese diplomatic behaviour vis--vis  the US is essentially impotent, weak-kneed and reactive.  It desperately wants a more multipolar order but doesnt  know how to get out of the current global hub-and-spokes  arrangement wherein the US is at the hub and other countries  are at the end of the different spokes, linked to the US  much more than to each other. To use a boxing metaphor,  skilful diplomacy is about punching your weight, neither  above nor below it.  But France, Germany, Russia and  China are all, singly as well as collectively, punching  far below their weight. Skilful diplomacy is about taking  calculated risks, asserting ones authority, letting the  US know that you cannot be taken for granted nor bullied.  The Chinese governments broadly meek and subdued acceptance  of US dictates in central and west Asia is not the expression  of a pragmatic wisdom but of diplomatic cowardice and ineptness.  That it shares these dismal attributes with so many other  governments is no consolation. But can we in India at least  be spared the pretence that diplomatic capitulation to the  US is both wise and necessary?

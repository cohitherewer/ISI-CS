 - Devaluing research reduces Indian universities to irrelevance  Tirthankar Roy The author is professor, Gokhale Institute  of Politics and Economics, Pune  While discussing how successfully  Indian higher education is globalizing, a colleague pointed  out a remarkable anomaly. At any stage of school education,  an Indian child is taught far more than the product of an  American or British school, and is likely to outdo the latter  in sheer breadth of knowledge. A simple test can be conducted  by weighing the respective school-bags. Often, this disparity  persists into undergraduate education. Some of our best  colleges teach more, and teach better, than the average  in the United States of America. And yet, as soon as this  stage of routine teaching is over and we arrive at the rather  more challenging graduate studies, it is the Indian who  aspires to be taught in America or Britain, and not the  other way round. Our learning curve rises much more steeply  than everyone elses until about the age of twenty, takes  a sharp downturn thereafter, and eventually drops below  everyone elses. At the end of the day, it is the easy-going  American who wins the Nobel Prize, and not the industrious  Indian. What makes the two systems singularly  different? The answer, at first sight, seems simple enough.  The American student goes on to win the Nobel Prize because  it is feasible for her to choose a university where she  will have the opportunity to be taught by a Nobel Prize  winner. The Indian loses steam because our universities  are filled with people who, with few exceptions, are poor  researchers. In short, the singular difference between the  two systems is in the level of synergy between teaching  and research. Reputed universities worldwide excel precisely  because they understand that research builds quality. No doubt, many among the university  faculty in India are industrious teachers. But it takes  more than industriousness to inspire a student to use education  creatively, and generate new ideas and applications. It  requires the ability to play around with key ideas and tools.  This is the difference that a good researcher makes in a  university department. This ability may be, to some extent,  intrinsic. But to be used effectively, it needs to be worked  on, perfected, and practised. Originality is a deliberate  and painstakingly cultivated quality of the mind. A university  department that hopes to produce fine researchers has to  have a sufficient number among its teachers whom the field  acknowledges to be fine researchers. In the classroom, they  are not necessarily good teachers, and yet they alone  can stimulate imagination, reveal intellectual possibilities,  and suggest projects that are bold but achievable. Their  own work-routine, moreover, illustrates what it takes in  practice to become a researcher. A department with just  good teachers will be no better than average. A department  with only good researchers will be more like a laboratory  than a classroom. The departments that stand out in the  world have both in good measure. This is where the best Indian  universities fall behind the world average. There are pathetically  few good researchers left among the university faculty in  India. Indian universities never really excelled in research.  Even the best departments in the country, in their heyday,  were better at coaching students for graduate studies abroad  than at producing researchers themselves. No less than the  Delhi School of Economics, arguably the best school for  economics teaching in India, is an example. And yet, twenty  years ago, the system understood the need for synergy between  teaching and research somewhat better than it does today.  There are signs that today it is much less sensitive to  this need, even deliberately indifferent to bringing research  back into the academic agenda. What danger are we in? If we continue  to run a university system with too little originality,  the system gets driven towards producing assembly-line training,  something comparable to the training the neighbourhood software  shop offers. Like the software shop, the university may  produce saleable skills. And yet, these are skills that  thousands of other teaching shops worldwide offer too. Devaluing  research and originality, in short, is the road to reducing  our universities to irrelevance in the world. It is a recipe  to kill their hope to establish a brand for quality. For,  quality needs synergy between teaching and research. It  needs good researchers to teach a subject. The symptoms of a devaluation  of quality abound all around us. Recruitment and promotion  rules in the university system have become singularly incapable  of recognizing quality and creating positive incentives  for world-class research. A bright economics PhD appearing  for a lecturership today will usually have much better-paying  offers from the corporate or media sectors. To attract such  people to teaching, the system needs to offer something  more than salary. But the average department hardly has  the freedom to offer her incentives like a good office,  research support, increments, and so on. No wonder that  the inflow of good students into doctoral programmes in  India has dwindled to dangerously low levels. In several states, an implicit  or explicit embargo on teaching jobs has been in force for  some time. In these states, an increasing proportion of  teaching is being contracted out to temporary teachers for  pathetically low fees. Forget non-monetary incentives, even  steady jobs and reasonable payments are obsolete ideas at  the entry level. What quality of teaching do we get for  such returns? As recruitment into regular faculty stops,  research teams keep breaking up due to retirement or turnover,  without the department being able to rebuild teams as they  wish. A senior researcher gets no special incentives  a  good office, a secretary, a reduced teaching load, a book-grant,  or some say in recruitment, for example.  A department cannot promote someone  on research without going through an exhaustingly complicated  procedure. The so-called merit promotion scheme is an anachronism,  it is a promotion system in which the last thing to matter  is merit. The lecture fees offered by the University Grants  Commission to university teachers for, say, taking refresher  courses is shamefully low, even as some of them are leading  figures in their field. The entire university system keeps  reminding the better-quality researchers, forget special  favours, this culture of poor salaries, rigid rules, levelling-down,  cheapness, and indifference is what you are really worth. Where do we go from here? One  ongoing step is a kind of credit-rating initiative. But  what good will rating a lot of bad apples do? What we need  to improve is the quality of the apples is to create strong  in-built rewards for research within these organizations.  We need incentives along global lines, to bring tough world  standards in, and to apply these standards to the senior  and junior alike. What could these rules be? Let fresh PhDs  with two international publications in a field get more  money and facilities. Create an inventory of all senior  teachers in the university system, grade them strictly by  their international publications and presence, by their  ongoing research record, and then make lecture-fees conditional  on these grades. Currently, research funding is given by  projects. Give research grants by people and department  as well. Create a few contractual positions available to  each department that has a credible research record. These  free positions will not be subject to rules, scales and  quotas, and can be filled by the department alone. We know that the Indian market  reforms in recent years have been a success and a failure.  Success, because a lot of goods and services we can produce  with cheap labour, from textiles to software, have found  large outlets abroad. Failure, because in the process India  has acquired an image for poor-quality work. Our university  reforms threaten to go the same way. As these institutions  globalize and compete for students and funding in the world,  they are likely to be known as poor-quality teaching shops  that can nevertheless teach a large number at low cost.  Do we want that?

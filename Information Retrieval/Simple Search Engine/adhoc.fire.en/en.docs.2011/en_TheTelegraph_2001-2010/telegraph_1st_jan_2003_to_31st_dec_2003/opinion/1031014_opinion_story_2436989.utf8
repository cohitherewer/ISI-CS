 - Indias relations with Israel transcends the prime ministership  of Sharon  J.N. Dixit The author is former foreign secretary  of India The Israeli prime minister, Ariel  Sharon, visited India early in September. He had to cut  short his visit and return to Israel because of incidents  of excessive violence against Israeli civilians by Palestinian  militants. His visit generated considerable controversy  within India and critical reaction from the Islamic and  Arab countries. The political significance of the visit  needs no extra emphasis. This was the first visit by an  Israeli prime minister to India, although the president  of Israel and the foreign minister of Israel have visited  India during the last decade. While judging the validity or  otherwise of the critical reaction to Sharons visit, the  basic question to be asked is whether the criticism was  against the existence and expansion of Indo-Israeli relations  or whether it was a reaction to the persona of Ariel Sharon.  It is obvious that the criticism was not about the existentialist  reality of Indo-Israeli relations which have evolved in  a positive manner over the last decade. It is Sharons personal  background and the timing of his visit which attracted criticism. Objectively speaking, Sharon has  a hawkish and aggressive anti-Palestinian reputation exceeding  even that of the former prime minister, Menechem Begin.  It is clear that Sharon is the architect of policies which  have destroyed the Oslo peace process that was supposed  to evolve into some kind of a solution to the Palestinian  problem. That such a person should come to India for high-level  discussions is certainly questionable because it was the  Oslo process which led to India establishing formal diplomatic  and political relations with Israel.  The timing of the visit was equally  unfortunate because it took place soon after the Israeli  cabinet took a decision that the removal of the chairman,  Yasser Arafat, from the power structure of the Palestine  Liberation Organization was an imperative to resolve Israeli  antagonism against the Palestinian people. The visit took  place in the context of increasing violence between the  Palestinians and the Israelis, and in the background of  attempts by the United States of America and the United  Kingdom to qualitatively erode Arafats authority by compelling  him to nominate Mehmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) as prime minister  of the Palestinian Authority.  Soon after Abbass appointment,  he tried to distance himself from Arafat and showed a willingness  to fall in line with the Western road map for a solution  to the problems of west Asia, an approach which has no support  from the Palestinians. The result was Abbas having to resign  his post and Arafat appointing the speaker of the Palestine  national assembly, Quriah (Abu Ala), as prime minister.  Quriah was not acceptable to the US and the UK, which had  reservations about him which in turn led to Quriah taking  the position that he will assume charge only when his acceptability  is formally acknowledged by all powers concerned.  Militants violence, compounded  by serious political instability and a threat to Arafats  position, even his life, characterizes the situation in  west Asia. Sharon has not shown any inclination to adopt  the middle path of a compromise. The reality is that he  seems to have basic support from the US for his policy orientations,  whatever obfuscatory white-washing may be indulged in by  the US and the UK in rationalizing their approach. Arafat  and the cause of the Palestinians are sought to be detached  from the historical context of their struggle and to be  converted into a part of the Wests anti-terrorist campaign. The ruling coalition of India  has been critical of the Congress Party objecting to Sharons  visit, claiming that the Congresss stand on the visit is  a contradiction because it was a Congress government which  formalized relations with Israel. This argument is inaccurate  because the rationale which led to P.V. Narasimha Raos  government formalizing relations with Israel was logical.  By mid-1991, the government of India had reliable information  from its diplomatic missions in the US and Scandinavian  countries that confidential contacts between the government  of Israel and the PLO were in progress in Spain, Sweden  and Norway. India had also received reliable confirmation  that contacts between the PLO and the government of Israel,  led by the late Yitzhak Rabin had the support of all the  major powers of the world, particularly the US and the Soviet  Union. More significantly, India had  received reports that the Israel-PLO contacts have the endorsement  of important Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, United  Arab Emirates and Kuwait. This change in Arab diplomatic  and political attitude was manifested in many of these countries  proceeding to establish contacts with the emerging Russian  federation. The other factors which led to  the Indian decision were Israels support to India on issues  related to Indias territorial integrity, particularly on  the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. This was despite India not  having any formal relations with Israel till 1992. India  had clear indications that the Oslo process would lead to  a reconciliation between the PLO and Israel, and that the  PLO will acquire a territorial identity and a recognized  governmental status. Working groups were to be established  following the Oslo agreement, to move towards this objective.  The PLO chairman, Yasser Arafat, when consulted by the prime  minister, Narasimha Rao, endorsed the government of Indias  intention to establish relations with Israel, emphasizing  that by this act, India would find a place in these multinational  working groups and will be able to safeguard Palestinian  interests.  Equally, if not more important,  were considerations of mutually beneficial interests which  led to the government of Indias decision to formalize relations  with Israel. There was a convergence of interests in countering  religious extremism and militant violence. There were concrete  possibilities of the establishment of substantive economic  relations, including trade and investment. There were clear  potentials for scientific and technological cooperation  between India and Israel. Israels agricultural experience  in dry farming, desert irrigation and agro-industries could  prove to be beneficial to India. Israeli experience in countering  militant violence was of relevance to India in dealing with  similar phenomenon in the country. But the overriding consideration,  of course, was the fact that the era of confrontation between  Israel and the PLO was expected to end. The rationale of Indias relations  with Israel has been vindicated as far as the bilateral  relations between the two countries go. It is the dimension  of Israel-PLO relations which have gone beyond expectations.  The peace process between Israel and the PLO received its  major setback with the assassination of the prime minister,  Yitzhak Rabin, followed by the weakening of the moderate  coalition led by him and Shimon Peres. The process continued  in fits and starts till the tenure of Ehud Barak of Israel.  With his departure, Israel-PLO relations have gone downhill  to a point where Sharon is not interested in a rational  compromise with the Palestinians.  What is unfortunate is that the  US is not interested in pressurizing Sharon to be reasonable  beyond cosmetic postures. The question is whether this stalemate  will result in Indias tangible interests being held hostage  to this situation. Indo-Israeli trade is of the order of  $1-1.5 billion, excluding the cost of the defence cooperation  between the two countries.  Cooperation in the fields of defence  supplies and training, science and technology and countering  terrorism has steadily increased. Israel provided critical  assistance to India during the Kargil war and the hijacking  of an Indian plane from Kathmandu to Kandahar. The latest  example is the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh having approved  consultations with Israeli security entities to beef up  security arrangements in Andhra Pradesh after a bomb attack  on him on the first of October.  Given the substance of the mutuality  of interests between India and Israel, the visit of the  Israeli prime minister to India was perhaps a logical exercise  in realpolitik. The only problem was that the prime minister  happens to be Ariel Sharon. Having acknowledged this reality,  one feels that declarations about strategic partnerships  with Israel, Indian policies having been previously affected  by electoral considerations inside India made by the deputy  prime minister, L.K. Advani, and the former minister for  external affairs, Jaswant Singh, were ill-advised. It would  have been sufficient to emphasize that Indo-Israeli relations  were based on the solid foundation of mutual interests and  mutual benefit.  The basic critical questions being  posed about Sharons visit is whether the visit has qualitatively  harmed Indias relations with Arab and Islamic countries.  There are two answers: first, Indian interests cannot be  held hostage to the general political orientations of the  Arab and Islamic countries. The second answer is that the  visit is not likely to have any negative impact on Indias  relations with Muslim countries because of the same logic  of mutual substantive interests. The point to be remembered  is that Indias stance supportive of the aspirations of  the Palestinian people has not changed.  India invited the foreign minister  of the Palestinian Authority just before Sharons visit  who acknowledged the usefulness of Indias relations with  Israel on the wider issues of peace in west Asia. The concerns  which he conveyed to us were mentioned to Sharon at the  highest levels by the prime minister and the president of  India.  It is worth noting that Arab countries  like Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Qatar have governmental  contacts with Israel. It should also be noted that other  Arab countries including Saudi Arabia, have not done anything  tangible supporting the PLO in the current critical situation.  In fact, India has been more articulate about the cause  of Palestinians, to the Israelis than these countries.  The important fact to be remembered  is that the importance of Indo-Israeli relations transcends  the prime-ministership of Sharon. It is a different matter  that the government of India dealt with Sharon because of  its perceptions of current needs. These perceptions were  not entirely valid.

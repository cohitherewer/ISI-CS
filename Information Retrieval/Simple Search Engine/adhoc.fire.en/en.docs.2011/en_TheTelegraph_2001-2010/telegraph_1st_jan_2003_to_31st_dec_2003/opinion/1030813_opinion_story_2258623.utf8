 Much like its politics, the lefts protests against the apex courts judgment on strikes by government employees sound hollow, argues Ashis Chakrabarti				 Class conscious																								It is unlikely that governments and other public sector employers will now cry, a la J. Jayalalithaa, Off with their jobs every time their employees strike work. Banning strikes is easier than enforcing the ban, particularly in a democracy because of the compulsions of electoral politics. Even in an age of neo-conservatism, which is not exactly the golden age of labour, employers  from British Airways to Hyundai to oil companies in Venezuela  have to live with strikes. So, it would be nave to expect that strikes by government employees are going to be a thing of the Bad Old Days just because the Supreme Court has said that they have no fundamental, statutory, equitable or moral right to strike work. Hadnt the same court earlier banned enforcements of bandhs by political parties or other organizations? 																								But the judgment makes a fundamental point that is more crucial than the argument on whether it can be  or, will be  implemented. It has articulated the societys increasing impatience with the anti-work culture that has come to be symbolized in strikes. Government employees were the subject of the case before the court; but the judgment reflects the rising voice in different sections of the society against the culture of strikes. There could be a judgment next time expressing the same revulsion against strike-happy and work-shy college teachers or municipal workers. 																								Government employees, however, have come to symbolize this shameful absence of a work ethic more than any other group of employees. The travails of getting any work done in a government office, especially in a state like West Bengal, where government and employees together run an unholy nexus of clerkdom, can be a sickening experience. With the Left Front government recognizing the employees right to strike and thereby presiding over the culture of anti-work, it is no wonder that the malaise has spread to other sections of employees, including even teachers and doctors. It is no secret that large sections of college teachers, long used to vacations spanning two months and to lax rules, now resent the five-hour stay at the workplace made obligatory by the University Grants Commission. 																								Worse still, the disease has struck so deep that these employees seem completely immune to any sense of guilt or shame. They pretend they are doing you a favour by doing what they are paid to do. In turning away someone visiting their office for work, the babu feels no compunction on the score that he may have come from far or spent a whole day to try and get the work done. It is routine in government offices for a simple job, that should take barely half an hour to do, to be dragged on for days  and not a care about the damage it does to the public or even to the government itself. Because of this insensitivity they care nothing about working in dusty, unhygienic offices where people spit on walls. 																								And they care nothing about the image they have acquired over the decades. While the left-supported employees unions in Calcutta took out processions crying foul over the Supreme Court judgment, they drew little sympathy from the common people for their protests. Here are the employees, the average public reaction would be, who have the most secure of jobs but who least deserve to keep them. This is the popular mood that has been captured by the court judgment and the employees have only themselves to blame for this loss of credibility and public sympathy. 																								Actually, the left parties, whose adjuncts these unions are, have the same crisis of credibility when it comes to strikes. Not just the common people, even their own political constituents are increasingly sceptical of the use of strikes. The parties may need the strikes as a strategy for mobilization, but even the strikers are increasingly unsure why they need the strikes. The question for them is not whether to strike or not to strike but whether they lose or gain from the strike. It is not a moral dilemma; it is an expression of their confusions and loss of faith in the power of the strike as a bargaining tool. 																								Nowhere is this increasing irrelevance of strikes more evident than in industries in West Bengal. Nowhere is the lefts doublespeak on strikes more blatant than in this sphere. Since it is their very own government, the leftists would not like retrenched workers of closed factories to take recourse to strikes and bandhs lest these should threaten to destabilize the government. West Bengal may have become a haven for employers cheating workers of their provident fund and gratuity; but the government would not like the cheated workers to go on strike on the issue lest that should be an excuse for the employer to close shop. 																								In fact, it is the industrial workers, and not government employees, who have more reason than ever before to agitate against joblessness, wage cuts and sundry other curtailments of existing benefits. It is another matter that organizing strikes, instead of redressing their grievances, may plunge them into worse crises. But, like their politics, the lefts policy on strikes too smacks of opportunism. The workers in West Bengal are advised caution because of the friendly government here, while they are encouraged to be the old militants elsewhere. The same opportunism now prevents the farm labour from agitating even if they do not get the minimum wages prescribed by the government. 																								It is because of these reasons that the lefts protests against the Supreme Court verdict ring so hollow. They cannot convince their own supporters, let alone the common people, that strikes can achieve anything, while they themselves stand accused of the disruptive politics of bandhs and strikes. 																								The court judgment, therefore, does not sound like the voice of the ugly employer who revels in attacks on the working class. After all, the same Supreme Court once delivered a number of judgments which were hailed by the left as worker-friendly. It was the same court which included hospitals, educational institutions and many other establishments in the jurisdiction of the Industrial Disputes Act, thereby giving workers in these units the right to trade unionism and many financial benefits. If it has now articulated an opposite sentiment, the reason is to be sought as much in the new economic environs as in the societys eagerness to rid itself of the debilitating practices of the past. 																								One may debate if the court verdict is yet another manifestation of the neo-right sentiments fast overtaking certain sections of the polity. One can question if the law has been as active in taking a stand against illegal activities of employers. But by rising in defence of government employees right to strike, the leftists are playing the devils advocate.

 - The nature and function of corporate social responsibility  Commentarao / S.L. rao The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, raoslhotmail.com Do companies have a responsibility  to society beyond that of being law-abiding citizens who  run their companies in the most efficient manner? The Nineties have been a period  of upheaval for most Indian companies. And that is not only  due to market factors like more competition. It is because  of the entry of large foreign institutional investors. These  investors were far more professional than our then mutual  fund managers, investment advisors and other investors.  They actually studied markets, competition, managements  and company accounts. They understood them better and asked  questions. If they were not satisfied, they exited the investment  leading to sharp falls in values.  This lost wealth for other shareholders,  especially the ones who controlled the companies. It did  not suit the Central government, which was afraid that the  foreign investment might exit the country if the system  for regulating financial markets was considered as being  too opaque and ineffective in protecting shareholder interests.  Transparency of company accounts, managements and of market  values became increasingly necessary.  The information technology companies  were an important influence in the speed with which these  ideas became popular. Promoted as they were by white-collar  workers, mostly from the middle classes (and in some cases  making a virtue of their middle-class values), many of these  promoters were staggered by their sudden personal wealth.  They brought their values to bear on their companies and  behaved as if they were trustees for all shareholders. Most  of them lived modest personal lives and tried to be good  citizens paying their taxes and taking interest in the betterment  of their local community and society generally.  N.R. Narayanamurthy upset many  in the old economy by advocating that no company should  get away without paying taxes, calling for self-regulation  in salaries to top management, arguing for competence, and  not chromosomes, to determine management succession and  the like. His chief executive officer is actively involved  in the resurgence of Bangalore along with a group of other  socially conscious industrialists. They created the best  model so far in India of corporate executives effectively  improving a citys infrastructure and services. As their  companies began to be the movers and shakers of the stock  market, their examples influenced the demands from investors,  governments and even regulators on all companies for being  good citizens. The Nineties witnessed the rise  of the IT companies. It saw an upsurge in foreign investment  in Indian markets, accompanied by domestic small investors.  While the large foreign investors could withstand the adverse  effects of severe downturns in the market and many times  to anticipate them, this was not the case with the domestic  small investors. The seemingly wayward gyrations of the  stock market hurt them badly. It became apparent that these  were mostly because of the uninhibited rigging, insider-trading,  and thieving of large sums from scheduled and cooperative  banks in scams worth thousands of crore of rupees. Small investors lost faith in  the fairness of the stock markets and deserted them. Even  more was the loss of faith in new primary issues. Managements,  and not government, now determined the premiums at which  they were issued. Many blatantly rigged their prices artificially,  which fell soon after the successful oversubscribed issue.  Foreign investors also lost confidence in the market and  particularly in their regulation. This led to a spate of studies  and then measures to improve the quality of governance of  companies, their transparency and full disclosure, and amendments  to the laws and to listing requirements for companies on  the stock market. These moves were further encouraged by  the large number of American cases of collusion between  companies and their auditors, the ineffectiveness of outside  directors in controlling the misuse of powers by controlling  managements, and the apparently weak regulatory oversight  by the designated bodies. It was Infosys that led the way.  Good corporate governance is a  buzzword today in India as in other countries. The difficulty  is that all the legislation and regulation cannot prevent  misuse of authority by managements. The regulators need  to be constantly watchful, speedy in their investigation  and empowered to impose heavy penalties for abuse. This  is still not the case. The trouble is that many companies  in India do not yet understand their responsibility as good  corporate citizens. There is a feeling among promoters  that they own their companies and can decide which member  of their family will succeed them, how much they would be  paid and so on. There is little recognition that there are  other shareholders, however small, who are also owners.  They have not only to be consulted and approve major decisions  but these must also be in their interest.  The recent example of the shareholders  of Sky TV in the United Kingdom questioning his sons succession  when Rupert Murdoch steps down is a good signal. Instead,  they appointed an independent search firm to find the best  successor. This has yet to happen in India. Whether Bajaj  or Ballarpur or Shaw Wallace or Thermax or Sanmar or Bombay  Dyeing or many others, it is the family that puts its own  member in control, not based on any assessment of the most  competent but only on the fact of his DNA. Despite the talk  by some of them that they are M.K. Gandhis followers and  regard their control as a trust, when it comes to exercising  control it is a family member who gets it. The increased clout of independent  directors because of the recent changes in the company law  and listing agreements might serve to bring greater fairness  in determining succession. Perhaps independent directors  will begin to assert themselves and demand that the best  and not the most closely related candidate should be the  chief executive.  Corporate social responsibility  is about many things. It is about good governance in the  interest of all shareholders and not merely the ones in  control of the company. It is about ensuring that the company  adds to its wealth and that of the nation. It is about following  the laws and customs of the society in which the company  is placed. It is about the sensitivity to the environmental  and ecological effects of its actions, to developing the  capabilities of all in the enterprise and particularly of  the disadvantaged. It is also about taking some responsibility  for improving the life of the community in which the company  is located.  This does not mean that the company  neglects its reason for being  that is, its focus on its  products and services. But the involvement of the companys  people in community issues is necessary. It helps to improve  the acceptability and image of the company. It exposes the  employees to the realities of the societies in which they  live and makes them better managers and human beings. The contrast between the companies  from the old economy, as in Mumbai, and the new as in Bangalore  is striking in this respect. Mumbai started a movement called  Bombay First many years before Bangalore took the initiative  of the Bangalore Agenda Task Force. Both had the support  of the local state governments and local authorities and  had blue-riband boards consisting of the best-known managers  in the best companies in the two cities. The BATF has been  effective. Bombay First has not, despite reams of publicity  and big talk. The BATF has become a role model for other  cities in India and the World Bank is promoting it in other  countries.  Is it possible that the old companies  in Mumbai and elsewhere regard themselves as rulers and  not trustees, and therefore do not appreciate the need to  be actively participating in the betterment of the community?  Perhaps business schools in India might teach their students  that it is not wrong to want to be rich, but that they must  at the same time have a strong sense of social responsibility  and community involvement.

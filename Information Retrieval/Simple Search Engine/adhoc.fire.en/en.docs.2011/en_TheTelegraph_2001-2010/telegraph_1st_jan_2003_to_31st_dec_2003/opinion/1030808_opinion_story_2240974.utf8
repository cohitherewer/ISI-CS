		 Friday, August 08, 2003  Paperback PickingsA prison diary (vol II): Purgatory  (Pan,  5.99) by Jeffrey Archer records  his days in Wayland prison in Norfolk after he had been  transferred there from the high-security Belmarsh prison  in south London. That stay made up the material for the  first volume of the Prison Diary. His company has  changed substantially, since now he is with prisoners charged  mainly with non-violent crimes. Even in his diaries, Archer  is ever the novelist, polished, observant, restrained, neutrally  curious, and quite at home. Although a personal document,  Archers voice here is familiar, and his material reminiscent,  however mildly, of the world of intrigue and crime so excitingly  brought to life in his novels. Manual of the warrior of light  (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Paulo Coelho captures  the Portuguese writers inspirational philosophy of life  in the form of a manual. Framed by the story of a young  boys initiation into the meaning of faith in the deepest  beauties of life, the manual is the outcome of a dialogue  between him and a mysterious woman he meets on the beach  only twice. Margaret Jull Costas translation is able to  convey the limpid brevity of Coelhos almost poetic chapters,  in which the author charts out the strategies of the warrior  fighting for his enlightened destiny in the difficult world  of meanness, obscurity and hostility. More a poem than a  novel, the book extracts and strings together the philosophical  essence of Coelhos best-known novel, The Alchemist. Freedom of India in the words of its Architects (EastWest Books, Rs 450) edited and compiled by M.S. Ram is an unusual book on the Indian freedom movement. From Bahadur Shahs and Queen Victorias to Gandhis, Nehrus and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnans, voices are the substance of this volume, capturing the many aspects of the national struggle, its many aspects and its dynamic politics. The drama is inevitable, but also incidental, to the books documentary value. 																												The Green dwarf (Hesperus,  2.95) by Charlotte Bront is the fascinating product of a seventeen-year old imagination, which can hardly be called juvenile because of the young authors precocious blend of fantasy and tart humour. A complicated tale of love and intrigue, it is an obvious descendant of the convoluted tales that spewed collaboratively and endlessly from the four Bront siblings as they walked round and round the huge table in their dining room. It is still enjoyable, that is what is amazing.

		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003  WHY THE CAT GETS ALL THE CREAM
 Despite the recent leak, the CAT remains  the best way to screen students for the IIMs. It is comprehensive,  deman- ding, foolproof, and fairly inexpensive, writes Alok  Ray The author is professor of economics  at the Indian Institute of Management Calcutta 
 The views expressed by the author in this article are strictly  personal Value addition  Following the recent leak of the  CAT question paper, a number of questions are being asked  in the media regarding the role of the Indian Institutes  of Management and CAT in todays India. These deserve discussion  and debate. The first question: what roles  are the IIMs supposed to perform in a country like India?  The IIMs were established in the early Sixties. Even socialist  leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru found an urgent need for institutes  that would produce and train managers for the public and  the private sectors. The shortage of professional managers,  like shortage of capital, was regarded a crucial constraint  on Indias industrialization drive. Today, the two Indian  brands that are globally accepted as world class are the  IITs and IIMs. Graduates from these institutes are welcomed  on the payrolls of employers all over the world . Of course, there are the doubting  Thomases. Some think that managers cannot be produced in  business schools. Many great businessmen are self-taught.  True. But they miss a few points. First, what can be learned  through years of experience and doing can often be mastered  in a much shorter time though systematic education. Some  of the top unschooled managers have openly recognized  this.  Second, todays business world  is much more complex and competitive than it was earlier.  All scope for cost cutting, productivity improvement and  other ways of enhancing bottom lines by the use of sophisticated  state-of-the-art techniques must be exhausted for survival.  It was not so in older days of protectionism and licence-permit  raj.  Third, businessmen are not fools.  They would not have paid such high salaries to IIM graduates  over such a long period if they had not got their moneys  worth. One may still argue that it is not for their training  at the IIMs but the fact that they have been screened several  times by such demanding tests as the IIT joint entrance  examination and then again the IIM-CAT which gives them  their astronomical market value.  That is partly true but certainly  not the full explanation. Ask any IIM graduate and he would  vouch for the value added though quality education at the  IIMs. In any case, that brings us to the question of the  value of CAT. This year nearly 1.3 lakh students are competing  for the 1,200-odd seats at the six IIMs. The CAT is a written  test which evaluates a students quantitative, analytical  and verbal skills. Those who score very high are then called  for a group discussion and personal interviews. The CAT  scores, the scores at the GD and the interviews, past academic  achievements are all taken into consideration, with pre-determined  weights, to prepare a composite score and the final selection  is made strictly according to this list.  There is not a single known case  where a student has entered IIMs through the back door,  by violating the merit list, despite intense pressures from  different quarters. One circumstantial evidence would be  to verify how few (almost non-existent) among the successful  entrants to IIMs are the sons and daughters of IIM faculty  or board members. This shows how scrupulously the sanctity  of CAT and the admission procedure has been maintained over  the years. This years leakage, which most probably happened  at the press, is an aberration. Nonetheless, it is a matter  of deep regret and concern, specially as the IIT-JEE question  paper also got leaked a few years ago. This shows how vigilant  the test administrators need to be against unscrupulous  people who can do anything to enter the bastions of merit. How about the suggestion that  CAT be replaced by a single uniform national test for all  management schools and that personal interviews be done  away with? Apparently, this would reduce the hassles of  students. But imagine that a few undeserving students, who  paid a few lakhs to buy the question paper and answers,  manage to get through the CAT. At least, under the present  system, there is a fair chance that they would be screened  out at the interview stage. Moreover, the GDs and interviews  are meant to check the communication skills and leadership  qualities of the student which are so essential for managers.  The problem with a single admission  test for all management institutes is that the difference  in the quality of applicants and management schools is so  great in India that it is nearly impossible to devise a  single test which will be able to differentiate students  properly. The CAT is meant to screen out the really bright  from the rest. If all students are made to go through a  CAT-like super-difficult test, many of them would score  very poorly and there would be so much bunching at the lower  levels that it would not be possible to differentiate between  them. So, there will have to be a different test for such  students. For similar reasons, the Indian administrative  services examination has been kept different from the state-level  administrative service exams. The counter-argument is that all  management students in the United States of America go through  a single test called the GMAT. Why not in India? A few points  need to be noted here. The difference in quality between  the top business schools and the bottom schools in the US  would be much less than the corresponding difference in  India. Unfortunately in India, the All India Council of  Technical Education and various universities have given  approval to hundreds of management institutes which have  mushroomed without the required infrastructure and good  quality faculty. The standards of students going into such  institutes would also be correspondingly low.  Second, the GMAT has been a world-wide  test backed by enormous resources. A great deal of research  has been done over many years to make it scientifically  valid for a wide cross-section of students. The current  paper-setters of CAT or any other body in India are simply  not equipped to design such a test at this point of time.  Third, the GMAT is not a pencil  and paper test. For several years now, the GMAT (and GRE)  has been made an online test taken by students sitting at  a computer terminal at the testing centre. One can sit for  the test any day throughout the year. This is a big advantage  over the CAT which has to be taken on a fixed day throughout  India, irrespective of the students convenience. Why cant  applicants to the IIMs take the GMAT (instead of the CAT),  which is conducted throughout the year by the Educational  Testing Service of the US? ask some students.  There are several problems. One,  the GMAT is more than ten times expensive (costing around  $ 225 or more than Rs 10,000) than the CAT (which costs  around Rs 1,000). Two, logistically it is nearly impossible  for 1.3 lakh students to take online computer tests at ETS  test centres even if the examination is spread over several  months. For example, in Calcutta there is only one ETS test  centre for GMAT. Further, each test centre has a small number  of properly equipped computer terminals. Third, applicants  from remote areas or from poor families may not have adequate  familiarity with computers and computer-based tests. They  will be at a distinct disadvantage, relative to others.  For all these reasons it is not practicable to substitute  the CAT with the GMAT, at this point of time.  Finally, there is a feeling that  the fees charged by the IIMs  around Rs 3 lakh over a two  year period  are exorbitant for a poor country like India.  Here, remember that the average starting salary of an IIM  graduate is around Rs 6 lakh per annum. So, the two year  fees amount to only six months of their first years salary.  Why should they not pay for the cost of the high-class facilities  they enjoy when they can afford to pay?  For poor students, the IIMs provide  many scholarships. These can be further increased. Banks  are also eager to give loans to IIM students because repayment  is no problem. The government, since the early Nineties,  has been insisting that higher education  especially institutions  of engineering and management  should be self-financing  as far as possible. The IIMs are the one place where this  policy can be implemented, without compromising the equity  principle.

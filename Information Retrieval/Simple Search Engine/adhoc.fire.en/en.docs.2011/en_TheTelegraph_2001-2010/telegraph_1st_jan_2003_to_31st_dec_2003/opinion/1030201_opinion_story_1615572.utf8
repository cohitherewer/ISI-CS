		 Saturday, February 01, 2003 				 SURVIVING ANOTHER COLD WAR
 THIS ABOVE ALL KHUSHWANT SINGH				 	 The killing chill																								Never in my long life of 87 years have I suffered a worse winter than I did this year in Delhi. Right from Christmas to this day, it has been a succession of foggy mornings, a pale sun which gave no warmth and icy winds which chilled my aged bones. The lower temperature hovered between freezing point to five degrees celsius. Birds fly thousands of miles every summer and winter to warmer climes; so did I in the past years when I flew down to Goa to fill my lungs with fresh, warm sea breeze which lasted till Basant Panchmi, by which time winter loosened its stranglehold on northern India. This year I felt I was too old to travel and would make Delhi as conformable for myself as I could. I regretted the decision. 																								I brought more trouble on my own head  literally. I had my head massaged with warm oil, shampooed it with hot water and sat out in the garden to let the sun dry it. The sun was there but without any heat. By the time my head was dry, it was gripped with cold. I am familiar with the symptoms. It starts with sneezing. I have worked out by experience that when sneezes come in pairs, two at a time, there is nothing much to worry about. But when they come in singles, beware. All my calculations went haywire: sneezes came in explosions, more than six at a time. Then running eyes and a running nose, a constricted throat and head like a block of wood. I decided to heal myself. I tried Vitamin C tables with aspirin and hot lemon juice, run with lime and hot water, rasam twice a day. Nothing worked. Friends flooded with advice: take tulsi leaves and garlic in hot water, take two packets of lemonsip, take homeopathic pills and so on. Sneezing and running nose turned to phlegm, sinuses got blocked, giving me a throbbing headache; After six days I consulted my doctor. By then the cold had almost run its course. His medicine finally killed it. I survived yet another cold war.																								Break her bangles, cut her hair																								There are aspects of Indian life so abominably cruel that we do our best to pretend they do not exist and therefore we do not have to do anything about them. One such is the treatment of widows. They are not wanted by their late husbands family and their parents refuse to take them back. Their heads are tonsured, sindoor removed from the parting in their hair, bangles smashed, fine clothes taken away to be replaced with plain white. Many are dumped in ashrams in Varanasi or Vrindavan to become victims of pandas, priests and patrons of temples. The Hindustani word for a widow and prostitute is the same: randi.																								A couple of years ago, Mira Nair tried to make a film on the subject in Varanasi and got permission to do so. Her equipment was smashed up by hooligans and her crew hounded out of the city. Now Pavan Varma, our high commissioner in Cyprus, has written a moving poem: Widows of Vrindavan; it has been choreographed and performed in Bharatanatyam by Pratibha Prahlad. Pavan writes of a young Hindu bride widowed before the marriage has been consummated:																								And then they said:																								She must wear white																								Cut her hair																								Break her bangles 																								Remove the kajal																								Wash the sindoor																								Let her renounce meat, give up 																								spice,																								Adopt white! White, the colour 																								white!																								Bleach the mehndi; or anything else																								Recalling																								Even remotely																								The dreams of a bride.																								She is dumped in an ashram in Vrindavan and laments:																								I cannot find Krishna																								In this temple town																								Of overflowing sewage,																								Where pandas breed																								In concrete cess pools,																								And devotees walk on filth																								Without anyone noticing 																								I cannot find Krishna																								In this holy city.																								Although I chant His name.																								From seven to ten																								In the morning.																								Every evening.																								She ends up as a common whore:																								We live in the shadow																								Or whore houses,																								Prey for priests																								Landlords, rickshaw drivers																								Policemen, shopkeepers																								In fact, any male in sight.																								Pratibha, despite achieving a degree of excellence as a dancer is not really suited to play the role of a widow forced by circumstances into prostitution because she is never likely to become a widow. She is an unmarried mother of identical twin boys conceived through artificial insemination. Who the donor is no one knows. She is 50 years ahead of our times and lovely to behold.																								There still remains Saddam																								We have defeated terrorism worldwide																								Except for Saddam																								So we can strut about with pride																								And kiss our palm																								All that we had to do was to frown																								And the factories of terror turn turtle 																								and drown																								Whether in Sudan or Pakistan 																								The best example of it is the rise of 																								Fazlul Rehman,																								The Pakistani taliban;																								But there remains Saddam																								But for whom the world is beauteous 																								and calm,																								Worlds enemy number one																								To kill whom will be fun																								And lesson to one and all																								No, no, no failure, no attempt to divert 																								attention																								From al Qaida or bin Laden,																								See, whether in Bali or Delhi or hotbed 																								Valley																								Or New York, potentially																								The world is completely fearless and 																								free;																								But alas, unfortunately when it comes 																								to Iraq 																								Even the UN begins to bark																								And rather than continue to fight 																								India and Pakistan unite.

		 Wednesday, September 24, 2003  Reform by stealth
 - Disinvestment ought to belong to the domain of public reason  Pratap Bhanu Mehta The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University There is a danger that both defenders  and opponents of privatization will draw the wrong lesson  from the recent Supreme Court judgment halting the sale  of two public sector oil companies. Opponents of the judgment  dismiss it as yet another example of the judiciary being  an obstacle to reform. On this view, the Supreme Court is  an institution that is unmindful of the economic costs of  its decisions, and impervious to the fact that taking powers  away from the executive to privatize without specific legislative  approval is as good as killing reforms. Defenders of the  decision, on the other hand, see the court as an institution  that has finally asserted the rights of Parliament and put  a break on a small coterie of liberalizers.  Although an ardent supporter of  disinvestment, I have to admit that the legal and constitutional  arguments, on balance, support the judgment. The judgment  does not imply, as one commentator hyperbolically put it,  that public sector companies cannot even sell raddi  without the consent of Parliament. But the acts facilitating  the acquisition of the three original oil companies did  require that shares could be transferred only to another  government company.  That this may be a product of  socialist-era legislation is hardly a constitutional and  legal argument. Those who would impugn the judgment on these  grounds betray their own impatience with constitutional  values. It is true that the Supreme Court has, in recent  times, overstepped its own constitutional mandate and often  contributed to a good deal of economic obtuseness that Arun  Shourie rightly complains of. But this is not sufficient  reason to be contemptuous of its all-too-infrequent defence  of representative government.  Opponents of the judgment invoke  the Balco case as a precedent. But it is a mistaken case  to invoke for two reasons. First, the grounds of the challenge  in that case were different. It was whether the interests  of the employees had been duly protected. Second, and this  is a point most commentators seem to have missed, even in  the Balco case the court had taken note of the fact that  a motion that this house disapproves of the proposed disinvestments  of Bharat Aluminum Company was defeated in the Lok Sabha  on March 1, 2001. In other words, Balco also had the imprimatur  of parliamentary approval behind it.  This fact about the circumstances  leading up to the privatization of Balco, brings out the  peculiarity of the present conjuncture. Neither the defenders,  nor the opponents of the privatization of state-owned companies  want to face a genuine parliamentary debate. Nothing stopped  the opponents of disinvestment from bringing a motion to  the floor of the house as was done in the case of Balco.  The ruling party, at least, had a reason to fear Parliament.  It could not count on its ability to carry the Rajya Sabha.  But that very fact should have prompted opponents of disinvestment  to use Parliament more effectively to canvas opposition  to disinvestments.  The fact that they did not take  parliamentary initiative to block disinvestments suggests  two things. First, that the opponents of disinvestments  are more interested in stalling it, than they are in publicly  defending their positions. Second, they fear Parliament  as much as the ruling party does for the simple reason that  they will have to take a stand. And taking clear defensible  stands is what most parliamentarians seem to fear. We are  now, therefore, in this peculiar position of applauding  the triumph of Parliament as an institution at a time when  parliamentarians, from all political parties, fear Parliament  the most.  Economic reform over the last  de- cade has involved what the political scientist, Rob  Jenkins, called reform by stealth, that is, reform by  piecemeal executive action that avoided great public debates.  No political party has had the political courage or faith  in public reason to stand fully behind reform. The Congress  speaks in two voices on its own liberalization legacy. Despite  the self-created visibility of reformers like Shourie, the  Bharatiya Janata Party has also never fully claimed the  mandate for reform.  Economic reform of the magnitude  that needs to be undertaken requires more than simply an  occasional speech. It requires a concerted effort to explain  the purpose of reform, to mobilize new coalitions that can  be convinced that they will be genuine beneficiaries of  reform, and the ruling party has done little of this political  groundwork. Reform by stealth suited everybody  they could  be for and against reform at the same time.  Debate over reform has been plagued  by too many bad arguments. Opponents of disinvestments have  hid behind phrases like public interest and strategic  sector without explaining either what these euphemisms  mean, or why state companies are the only way of serving  these interests. Proponents of disinvestments, because they  have had to proceed on a case-by-case basis, have rarely  made an argument for the proper sequencing of companies  to privatize, or how the resources thus generated can be  put to optimal use. The silver lining of the courts judgment  will be that it puts disinvestments squarely where it belongs:  in the domain of public reason. There is a political case for  disinvestment. Disinvestment, though not a panacea, represents  one aspect of a transformation in the place of government  in our lives. Government, at the moment, is a massive concentration  of power that promiscuously intervenes as and when it pleases,  frames rules to maximize its own rents and powers of patronage,  uses taxes inefficiently and spends vast energies on things  that are peripheral to bettering our existence. Reorganizing  government, to take it out of areas where it does not belong,  so that it can better concentrate on areas where it does,  ought to be the prime goal of reform. Disinvestment is one aspect of  this aspiration. Imagine how much time and energy is needed  to superintend thousands of public sector units; imagine  how many opportunities for rent-seeking this panoply of  frivolous activities offers to civil servants and politicians.  Second, the economy needs credible signals for private initiative.  Investors need to be assured that enterprise will not be  stifled, curtailed or distorted by a huge government presence.  Disinvestment is a way of signalling that government thinking  on incentive-distorting interventions in the economy has  changed. As a matter of principle it wants to restore the  by-now-lost distinction between government and a trading  company by getting rid of needless commercial involvement.  Third, disinvestment is a way of reorganizing governments  priorities.  It is a pity that the government  has used proceeds from disinvestments in a purely technical  way: reducing fiscal deficits. Instead, it should have made  a social contract that proceeds from disinvestments be used  to completely transform and reallocate the governments  budget. It would lead to massively greater spending on two  sectors where the government is badly needed: health and  education. Imagine the difference between saying: We need  the forty thousand crore from disinvestments to cut fiscal  deficit, and saying, This forty thousand crore will be  earmarked, above existing allocations, to ensure that every  child, but especially those from deprived communities such  as Dalits, will have access to health and education. This  would be a hard gambit to say no to. The deficit can be  reduced in other areas: frivolous government expenditure,  subsidies and so forth. It is not too optimistic to believe  that a political fight will not only be good for representative  government but also for the long-run prospects of reform.  After all, stealth can only get you so far. It does not  have the transformative potential of an open ideological  battle.

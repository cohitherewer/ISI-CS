		 Monday, October 20, 2003  THE DILEMMA IN MILK
 - Verghese Kuriens cooperative model suits the Indian milk-producer  COMMENTARAO / S.L. RAO The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission raoslhotmail.com Indias white revolution was  the result of the Kaira cooperative model with products  under the Amul name, and was nurtured by Verghese Kurien.  Private dairy companies, and especially multinationals,  opposed this model. Amul innovated a baby food based on  buffalo milk. Multinationals mocked this effort and implied  that it would harm infants. Kurien, in turn, made life as  difficult as possible for the multinationals in milk. The white revolution brought  millions of small milk producers together to supply milk  to the collection centres. From there, the milk was transported  to dairies for processing, standardizing the fat content,  using the surplus fat to make butter, ghee and other  value-added products. The surplus milk in the flush season  was converted into milk powder that could be reconstituted  or mixed with liquid milk in the lean season. This ensured  an uninterrupted flow of milk to consumers. The cooperative model helped the  cattle-owners to develop a sense of participation and ownership.  They got a guaranteed price in cash every day for all their  milk supply. They were not cheated and paid no bribes. Comprehensive  surveys show that the milk revolution has significantly  added to the incomes of landless peasants. It has bettered  the diets of most Indians. It has made fresh liquid milk  available through the year in urban centres and in milk-short  areas, like Tamil Nadu, where families in the past substituted  skimmed milk powder, baby food and Horlicks for milk. Could the milk producer have got  a better price from private dairy companies than from the  cooperatives? Perhaps. But cooperatives give a consistent  price through the year. None of his production goes waste.  He gets help to keep his cattle healthy and to improve the  breed. These benefits are unlikely from a profit-oriented  company. After the success of the Kaira  cooperative milk producers union and their Amul brand, the  milk cooperative movement was helped to spread by the National  Dairy Development Board headed by Kurien, with support from  the European Union. The EU countries had an unusable milk  mountain resulting from the large subsidies to their farmers.  Some of this milk powder and butter fat was given to India  through the NDDB. The sales proceeds were used to build  infrastructure for milk collection and processing and help  in setting up milk cooperatives, dairies, veterinary centres,  and the like. Kuriens leadership, single-minded determination,  willingness to battle with anyone, management and communication  skills made it possible. Concurrently Amul was built to  become a well-loved brand standing for a range of milk-based  products of high quality and low price. Kurien demonstrated  to the multinational companies that the cooperative principle,  rather than the profit motive that drives companies, was  what would benefit consumers and milk producers alike. The  NDDB established cooperatives in many states. These developed  their own brands of milk products  Vijaya, Verka, Milma,  Sudha, Nandini and the like. They competed in some markets  with each other. But the nationally dominant brand was Amul.  The marketing expertise behind Amul was given through the  NDDB to the other state cooperative brands. Kurien strongly supported the  appointment of his chief lieutenant for many years as the  chief of the NDDB. She proposed to establish two joint ventures  with cooperatives with 51 per cent equity to the NDDB. Each  company would function independently to promote its brands.  The NDDB would give marketing support earlier supplied by  Amul. It would continue to fund newer cooperatives. The corporatization proposals  are said by Kurien to be a betrayal of the cooperative principle.  He would prefer the NDDB to hold the minority share at 49  per cent in order to safeguard the cooperatives since the  NDDB might in future offload its equity in the market. What are the issues? The companies  formed for marketing dairy products might go into private  and even multinational hands. The search for productivity  and cost improvement might lead to the corporatization of  the supply cooperatives. The corporate model has helped  both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations. It has  optimized return from limited resources. A company works  for the maximization of profit and efficiencies for shareholder  value and corporate growth. The cooperative shares the available  surplus among very poor, largely landless peasants. The  company strives for the maximum possible premium price.  The cooperative charges the lowest price possible consistent  with the interests of the producers.  The majority of the milk producers  supplying milk to the cooperatives are owners of one or  two cattle. Their methods cannot be as efficient in maximizing  productivity (in milk yields) of cattle. The corporate model  in dairying, as it has developed in the West, puts hundreds  of cattle together in one tightly packed shed, ensures minimum  exercise to the cattle so that they can grow quickly, feeds  them with carefully planned nutrient mixes, growth hormones  and animal matter to improve milk yields and keep costs  low. The results have been sometimes disastrous for infants.  The mad cow disease resulted from feeding vegetarian cattle  with animal matter to lower feed costs. The small and poor  Indian milk producer cannot dream of any of these techniques.  They demand size. A private marketing company for  the cooperative will put pressures on cost even on the cooperative  dairy supplier. It might even import the cheap milk available  in more efficient producing countries where there are huge  subsidies to the producers. Such cheap imports could spoil  the Indian market for the milk produced by the small owners. The cooperative model suits the  nature of the milk producer in India. Large numbers of very  poor landless labour and limited cattle ownership by many  such people make it inevitable. It supplements their poor  incomes. The cooperative has harnessed these many producers  into a wondrous whole and a consequent white revolution.  Corporatization of dairy products marketing might lead to  this being introduced in milk supply as well. The corporate  model enables substantial cost reduction. It will also dislodge  millions of small cattle owners. This is a danger that we  must not allow the Indian milk producer to face until he  has many other options to improve his income. There are many other things that  the cooperative dairy movement can do with the help of the  NDDB. It could, through central marketing support, considerably  improve the marketing and brand-building. For this it has  to develop its own strong marketing expertise. The NDDB  could promote cooperation in marketing by specializing in  selected products where possible. It should continue to  promote the training and restructuring of existing cooperatives.  Dairies could use each others production facilities to  label each others brands to save on avoidable transportation  and holding of extra stock. The cooperatives could develop  grameen banks for women who are the principal family  members looking after the cattle. They take the milk daily  to the collection centres. They could supply liquid milk  and powder on contract to the companies that want to process  them further into milk products. The NDDB has a major role  to play in strengthening the milk production and marketing  infrastructure and capabilities. Kurien is right in objecting  now to the entry of corporate cultures, even into milk marketing,  for fear that it might enter into milk collection and processing. The public criticism by Kurien  of his protg, the chief of NDDB, must cease. The basic  issues must instead be debated in public. Kurien deserves  the nations gratitude and obeisance but he must allow his  successors to adapt to new and changing environments. If  public debate leads to the conclusion that NDDB can safely  experiment with corporatization, it should do so. But it  is essential that Kuriens legacy be nurtured. That requires  transparency and consultation in major policy decisions.

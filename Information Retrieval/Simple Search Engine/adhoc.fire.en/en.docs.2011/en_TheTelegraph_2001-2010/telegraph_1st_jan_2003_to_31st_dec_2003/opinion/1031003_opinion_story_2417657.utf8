 DELHI: THE EMPERORS CITY (Roli, Rs 850)  by Vijay Goel is a photographic rediscovery of Old Delhi  or Chandni Chowk and its environs. Chandni Chowk happens  to be Goels constituency, but he has also grown up around  the Walled City variously known as Shahjahanabad, Purani  Dilli and Purana Shahar. This is a rather  lavishly unremarkable book, providing important information  and addresses of havelis, mosques, churches, colleges,  railway stations, post offices, shops and other architectural  treasures in the area. This picture is of the haveli in  which the poet, Mirza Ghalib, lived with his wife, Umrao  Begum, from 1860 until his death in 1869. It is on Gali  Qasim Jaan, Ballimaran, and is now a memorial, depicting  Ghalibs life through portraits, manuscripts and memorabilia.  Goel provides suggestions for several heritage walks through  the old city, and would like to see Shahjahanabad declared  a Heritage City.

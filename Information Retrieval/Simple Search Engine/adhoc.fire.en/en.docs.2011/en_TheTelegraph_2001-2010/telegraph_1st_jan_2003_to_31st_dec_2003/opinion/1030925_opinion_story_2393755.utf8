		 Thursday, September 25, 2003  Politics of security
 - Security is secondary to domestic political considerations  in India  V.R. Raghavan The author is former director general  military operations, and currently director, Delhi Policy  Group As I write this essay on security,  diverse images dominate the national scene. Gazi Baba, who  planned the attacks on Parliament and other places, was  killed in an encounter in Srinagar. The Mumbai blasts at  India Gate and Zaveri Bazaar killed and wounded nearly two  hundred ordinary citizens. Police in Delhi intercepted a  fruit lorry carrying explosives and then surrounded and  killed terrorists who were going to use them in the capital.  Mulayam Singh Yadavs first decision on becoming Uttar Pradeshs  chief minister was to release political leaders arrested  by the Mayavati government under the Prevention of Terrorist  Act. In Tamil Nadu, Vaiko, who is part of the ruling alliance  in New Delhi, remains incarcerated under the POTA since  more than a year. Nafisa Ali, who spoke against the actions  of Narendra Modi, has been charged for inciting communal  violence in Gujarat. Through these contrasting images runs  the common thread of political needs. Politics and considerations  of political economy define the contours of national security.  Gazi Babas death was well deserved.  It came about through effective intelligence and impressive  coordinated action by the Border Security Force, the army  and the police. The Delhi event was due to effective intelligence  and coordinated action with the police. The Mumbai blasts  were not unexpected, but the city police could only react  after the gruesome slaughter of innocents. This state of  affairs has been laid at the door of political interference  and misuse of the police machinery.  The growth of the law and order  machinery in the country over the decades offers an insight  into the scope of the problem. Para-military and central  police forces have been increased exponentially in the last  three decades. The army by contrast has remained nearly  unchanged over the last two decades, until the Jammu and  Kashmir situation led to the creation of Rashtriya Rifles.  Starting in 1965, the BSF now has over 150 battalions and  the Central Reserve Police Force has grown from 80 battalions  in 1986 to nearly 150. Some estimates put the costs of these  increases to nearly Rs 50 billion.  There has been a corresponding  increase in other forces like the Indo-Tibetan Border Police,  the Central Industrial Security Force and the like. The  one constant in this colossal growth is that law and order  and internal security have not improved correspondingly.  There are other acts which get  applied equally carelessly and selectively by governments  at the Centre and in the states. Recently, the Centre desired  to have powers to send the army into the states, even without  the state governments request for it. State governments  have understandably objected to such powers being vested  in the Centre. The Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention)  Act and the POTA have both been used for political rather  than security purposes. Indias northeastern states and  Jammu and Kashmir are well aware of another law, the Armed  Forces Special Powers Act. The act has been in force in  some form or other in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir  for a long time.  The act empowers the security  forces with authority to search, arrest and even shoot when  its personnel so decide. These have been called, not without  justification, draconian powers unwarranted in a democratic  polity. In fact, applying the AFSPA reflects on the inability  of the government to manage security, in spite of the wide  range of powers available to it through normal laws. In Delhi itself, there is greater  political concern for statehood and the powers of lieutenant  governor over the Sheila Dixit government, than about security.  In major states of India, police and intelligence machinery  has been corrupted by caste, political preference and interference.  Promotions, postings and recruitment have been subjected  to quotas, shifaarish, and money considerations.  Newspapers in Delhi have written and published photographs  of policemen taking money on the streets. Mumbai, some decades  ago, was reputed to be one of the safest metros in the world.  In fact the police-underworld network of intelligence was  so good that a missing person or stolen purse could be traced  by the evening of the day the theft occurred. Today, the  police intelligence department is the least popular in Mumbai.  There is not enough money in it for the making.  The same is true of the civil  services which run the country. The preferred service is  customs and excise, rather than the Indian administrative  service or the Indian foreign service. In fact, the finance  minister has recently decided to personally monitor postings  and transfers in customs and excise. There have been cases  of terrorists and criminals living in the quarters of the  members of Parliament. The Vohra committee report on the  crime and politics nexus is collecting dust. Excellent reports  on improving police efficiency, from the Dharam Vira report  to many others, have joined the category of archival material.  Crime and terrorism are no longer  a state or even a national phenomena. They transcend borders  and nations. Information technology and globalization realities  have made it possible to plan and perpetrate an international  response to a local event. Governments cannot control or  prevent this. A policy of pogrom in Gujarat evokes an internationally  planned response in Mumbai. An American action in west Asia  brings about a violent response in Dar es Salaam or in New  York.  Governments have yet to grasp  the meaning of security in a globalized world. Security  cannot be had by more and more security forces. It can only  be had by the citizens being made secure from political  short-sightedness. Politics and security can no longer be  treated as separate issues. Bad politics can only bring  poor security. The price of this is borne by the common  man who alone is hit by bomb blasts.  India has the opportunity to break  free of the political and security mindsets that have guided  its leaders for decades. Just as economic reforms come through  changed mindsets, political and security reforms will only  come through new approaches. The coming elections in the  states and the general elections next year provide the opportunity  to do so. Can we then expect the elections in UP, Madhya  Pradesh, Rajasthan and other states to be fought on issues  that affect the citizens lives; like good governance, development  and communal harmony? There is a greater probability that  cow slaughter, masjids, bhojshalas and other  trivial issues will be used to win elections. Security will  continue to be subordinate to domestic political considerations.  That is the tragedy both of Bharat Mata and the Republic  of India.

		 Monday, December 08, 2003  NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS
 The government would not have doled  out Rs 54 crore for Doordarshans new all-news channel if  the stakes were not politically vital, argues Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting Old and weary  By all means, let Doordarshan  launch an all-news channel; in fact, they could even have  a separate channel for domestic news and a separate one  for international news. Why not? If the government has the  funds and is so inclined, who is to stop such channels from  being launched? But there are a few questions that must  be answered before they do that. For one thing, the funds being  used are public funds. Did the government ever stop to think  out the rationale for the news channel they have started?  It is not as easy as one thinks it is. Get the government  to provide some of the taxpayers funds, hire some news  people at enormous cost, farm out time to some tried and  tested private news outfits, and presto, you have a news  channel. It is not that easy. Content is not manufactured;  true, there are news agencies which will provide you with  visual coverage but that, again, is not enough. It is essential  to study, carefully, the need for such a channel, to consider  whether or not the existing news bulletins are enough or  will an augmentation of those suffice, and a host of other  basic issues that are part of the essential focus  is a  full time and exclusive news channel necessary? Remember, there was a DD News  channel only a few years back; it too had expensive anchors,  studio interviews, correspondents in the field reporting  live during a news bulletin, and so on. It folded up. Why?  Was it because the news operation collapsed? Not a bit.  It folded up because it had run up huge losses, and Doordarshan  simply could not sustain these. Now what has happened in  the few years that followed to make a full-time news channel  viable? Nothing at all. In fact, Doordarshan revenues have  been dropping steadily over the years.  What is it, then, that made the  government dole out Rs 54 crore to start up the news channel?  Knowing it would not only earn nothing but would continue  to need larger and larger infusions of funds? Clearly money  was not the consideration; it was very obviously the reach  that Doordarshan says it has  and for the time being has,  but only for the time being  taking its signal, no matter  how terrible its quality to remote corners of the country.  That reach is more of a myth than anything else; in the  very large areas now covered by cable and satellite channels,  Doordarshan has virtually no viewership at all, even of  its news bulletins; viewers prefer to watch Aaj Tak, Zee  or NDTV 24x7 or any of the other news channels that are  available. For only one reason. There is a general conviction  that these channels report the facts without any bias. They  are credible. Doordarshan is not, lets face it. The news  bulletins are not bad at all; either in the manner in which  the news is presented or in the coverage. But it lacks credibility.  One has only to ask the man in the street to get a confirmation  of this. So, now, if it is not watched,  or is watched by a few, in areas where private news channels  are visible, then those areas have to be, if one is being  realistic, taken out of the reach of Doordarshan; because  there the reach may exist, but not the viewership. And what  matters is the viewership, not the reach. The Doordarshan  signal may well reach Mount Everest; but whos there to  see it? Lets look, then, at the areas where there is no  cable and satellite signal, but Doordarshan can be seen  terrestrially. There, certainly, viewers will watch Doordarshan  since they have nothing else to watch. But these are mostly  remote areas, where there arent too many people, that is,  too many votes.  The trouble is that Doordarshan   or Prasar Bharati  has this weird ostrich syndrome. They  will see and hear what they want to; for the rest theyll  bury their heads in the sand, which in their case are their  own comforting ideas of the millions avidly watching their  programmes. They believe the news channel will be watched;  and lo, it is being watched, as their faithful officials  will eagerly tell the boss-men. If they dont they will  be dubbed anti-people, accused of not acting in the public  interest, and there may even be a few CBI cases started  against some of them. And to think that, folly of follies,  this news channel was started by cannibalizing DD Metro!  Not that DD Metro had much on it worth watching, but it  had the potential. Did no one in Doordarshan or Prasar Bharati  see that? It could have been built up as a very attractive  channel that could have embodied the best of public service  broadcasting, which would have given the mere entertainers  a run for their money. Did no one think of spending Rs 54  crores on it? Why on a news channel that very few will watch? For the obvious reason. This is  going to be a propaganda channel, nothing less. It will  carry news, true; it will have current affairs programmes  by Saeed Naqvi and Rajat Sharma and others, true. But there  will be programmes  many of them  that will speak glowingly  of the achievements of the government. Nothing wrong with  that at all, but these programmes tend to be glossed up,  like the pictures of new cars that look shinier, sleeker  than they really are. These programmes will be skilfully   or so they think  interposed between news bulletins and  current affairs programmes. The finance ministry doesnt  part with 54 crore unless the stakes are politically vital.  It must be the political angle that made them agree.  The sad thing is that television  never ever won any political party or alliance an election.  Just go over all the elections where Doordarshan has been  manipulated brazenly to project the ruling party. Go back  to the 1989 general elections, when Rajiv Gandhi lost. Go  back to 1996, when P.V. Narasimha Rao lost. But, tragically,  our political rulers persist in thinking people are fools.  Just because they see a large number come to their rallies  and shout slogans, they make the mistake of thinking that  reaching them through television sets will have the same  effect. It wont. The voters, especially where it matters,  have not only a choice of candidates but of television news  channels. What they want from them are facts, information.  Not views, not propaganda. They want all political parties  to be projected in the news bulletins.  Does the ruling coalition really  think that viewers have not understood why the news channel  was pushed through with such comic haste? They know too  that general elections are only around a year away and it  is time for politicians to start putting on their acts.  But that is another story; this  one is slightly different, a story of sheer waste. A waste  of public money, a waste of talent, a waste of time. Its  tragic; a non-essential, hastily-put-together unnecessary  channel is launched by stamping out one that could have  been built up; but then, if that were to be of relevance,  one would have to assume a certain commitment to good public  service broadcasting. The CEO of Prasar Bharati seems to  have called the private news channels vested interests;  the waste of 54 crore, and the frantically hasty starting  of DD News after cannibalizing DD Metro shows exactly where  the vested interest really is. And what the commitment  really is.

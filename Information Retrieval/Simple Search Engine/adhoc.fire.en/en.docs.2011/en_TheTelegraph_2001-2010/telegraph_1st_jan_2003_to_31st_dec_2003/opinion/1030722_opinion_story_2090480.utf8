 - Election costs remain a challenge for the Indian democracy  PRATAP BHANU MEHTA The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University The reform and regulation of the  ways in which elections are financed remain the single most  difficult challenge for the Indian democracy. Arguably,  all attempts at reform will come to naught unless the question  of political finance is tackled head-on. The imperative  to raise money for elections, combined with unrealistic,  unworkable and unenforceable existing laws on campaign finance,  produces profound distortions in the working of Indian democracy.  The need to raise funds for elections is one of the primary  motivations for collecting an estimated Rs 70,000 crore  over five-year cycles of all elections.  With politicians almost required  to use their office to raise such funds, the entirety of  government becomes one giant edifice to collect rents. At  least some of the roots of corruption lie in the imperatives  to raise finance in a context where the cost of elections  is high, the legitimate rewards of office low, the chances  of re-election uncertain, and the organizational effort  required to mobilize voters is massive. The repercussions  of the existing ways of collecting campaign finance are  felt across all areas of public life.  Most democracies attempt to regulate  election finance in four ways. Democracies can limit political  expenditures of parties, they can place limits on private  donations and contributions, they can offer public funds  for contesting elections, or they can introduce measures  that bring about transparency in the process of generating  funds. The idea behind the last measure is not so much to  restrict fund raising activities, as it is to provide information  to the voters on who is raising money from whom.  The Indian effort to regulate  election finance has largely concentrated on limiting election  expenditures. But this measure has proved to be self-defeating  for a number of reasons. Given the complicated logistics  of most constituencies, a ceiling of Rs 15 lakh for parliamentary  constituencies and Rs 6 lakh for assembly constituencies  are arguably unrealistically low. The state also  as the  recent report of the national commission to review the workings  of the Indian constitution reiterates  continues to try  and manage campaigns in detail by fixing the length of the  campaign and so forth. Most of these measures are ineffective  in regulating campaign finance.  The attempts to place limits on  private donations by, for example, allowing companies to  contribute up to 5 per cent of their profit to political  parties have proved ineffective for a number of reasons.  Most important, under the present legal dispensation, both  the donors and parties have very little incentive to reveal  the extent of their donations. Monitoring and enforcing  limits on individual contributions are impossible in the  absence of any kind of transparency. But the challenge for  the Indian state is that the widespread opaqueness of our  financial system all across the board makes it difficult  to monitor such financial flows. Arguably, we cannot get  realistic campaign finance reform unless whole sectors of  our economy, like real estate markets that generate black  money and the system of taxation which more effectively  scrutinizes the flow of money that makes elections possible,  are reformed. But we are in a vicious circle where we will  not get reform of the state in part because of the need  to generate rents to finance elections, and an unreformed  state will continue to be ineffective in regulating electionmoney.  The third means of regulation,  state-financing of elections, has not been tried much in  India. In almost all democracies except the United States  of America and the United Kingdom, the proportion of public  financing of elections has been consistently rising in relation  to private funding. The costs of public financing are not  as high as might seem. Lok Satta, the only organization  that is doing imaginative work in this area, has circulated  a proposal that evolves a complex formula for public supplement  of private funding, that would cost less than Rs 250 crore  per election, based on an assumption that the total ceiling  for each constituency will be somewhere in the region of  Rs 50 lakh. The good news is that as percentage of gross  national product, the cost of elections is probably going  down substantially, and public funding, properly instituted,  is not entirely unaffordable.  Public funding can take not only  the form of direct grants but also indirect subsidies like  free radio and television time. The challenge for public  funding however is this. It appears from comparative experience  that public funding, ironically, works better in systems  that are already effective and transparent to some degree.  For public funding formulas to be effective, certain conditions  have to be met. First, public funding must encourage rather  than supplant private funding, because if seen as a substitute  for private funding, it becomes prohibitively expensive.  Second, public funding should be fair and transparent. It  should not be a means for already existing party oligarchies,  which usually derive their power from their ability to raise  funds, to strengthen their hold on parties.  In short, to be fair, public funding  presumes that political parties are transparent, well run  and considerably democratic in their internal workings.  Most Indian political parties have no effective intra-party  democracy, and in the absence of serious reform in party  structures, public funding is unlikely to yield good results.  Third, one should not overestimate the degree to which public  funding can be a panacea. Every single European country  with public funding of elections, from Germany to Italy  and Belgium, has continued to experience financial scandals  relating to politics.  The fourth prong of regulation,  transparency, has been very weak in India as well. Although  party accounts are supposed to be audited regularly, these  have proved to be an ineffectual check on party finances.  Much of the recent effort of bodies like the Supreme Court  and the Election Commission has been to try and strengthen  the disclosure requirements for political parties and candidates.  Declaration of a candidates assets, regular scrutiny of  part accounts that require the disclosure of all donors  who contribute more than Rs 10,000, and the filing of party  tax-returns are all steps in the right direction. A tax-return  is hardly the most reliable register of the true well-being  of most Indians. Inducing transparency in election finance  is parasitic upon the state being able to better regulate  other non-electoral institutions that impinge upon election  finance.  Any sensible strategy for regulating  campaign finance will have to work on all these four dimensions  simultaneously and bring them together in sustainable, realistic  and imaginative ways. Unfortunately, comparative experience  suggests that there are no quick legislative remedies. Indeed  campaign finance reform all around the world is replete  with an ever-expanding universe of dead-letter rules that  cannot be enforced, though effective disclosure and transparency  norms certainly help.  The real issue is: can the costs  of getting elected be held down? A substantial amount of  spending on the logistics of elections is inevitable, and  we ought to be realistic about these expenses. But evidence  from India suggests that a substantial amount of campaign  resources go into placating various constituencies, a polite  way of describing vote-buying. Ironically, the costs of  elections increase as the distinguishing characteristics  of individual candidates matter less and less to elections.  What increasingly distinguishes one candidate from another  is mobilizational and fund-raising capacity, not ideology  or personal competence.  So long as elections remain largely  about the former, campaign costs will continue to soar.  But unless a genuinely creative solution to the problem  of campaign financing is found, money will continue to usurp  politics, or in Gibbons words, corruption will remain  the one infallible sign of our liberty.

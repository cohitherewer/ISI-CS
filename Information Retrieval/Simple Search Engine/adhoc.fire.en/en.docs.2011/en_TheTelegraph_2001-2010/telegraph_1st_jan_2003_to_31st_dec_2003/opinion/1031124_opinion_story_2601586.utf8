 															-Document  Extracts from the Madrid International  Plan of Action on Ageing, April 2002				 	 Ageing in isolation																								The mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development is an essential component of the implementation of the International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002. Since 1982, reforms to promote the effective and efficient utilization of existing resources have received increasing attention. However, inadequate national revenue generation and collection, combined with new challenges regarding social services and social protection systems arising from demographic changes and other factors, jeopardize the financing of social services and social protection systems in many countries. There is also greater acceptance of the view that the increasing debt burden faced by the most indebted developing countries is unsustainable and constitutes one of the principal obstacles to achieving progress in people-centred sustainable development and poverty eradication. For many developing countries, as well as countries with economies in transition, excessive debt ser-vicing has severely constrained their capacity to promote social development and provide basic services. 																								We note with concern current estimates of dramatic shortfalls in resources required to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration. Achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, demands a new partnership between developed and developing countries. We commit ourselves to sound policies, good governance at all levels and the rule of law. We also commit ourselves to mobilizing domestic resources, attracting international flows, promoting international trade as an engine for development, increasing international financial and technical cooperation for development, sustainable debt financing and external debt relief and enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems.																								The commitments to strengthen policies and programmes to create inclusive, cohesive societies for all  women and men, children, young and older persons  are also essential...Housing and the surrounding environment are particularly important for older persons, inclusive of factors such as: accessibility and safety; the financial burden of maintaining a home; and the important emotional and psychological security of a home. It is recognized that good housing can promote good health and well-being. It is also important that older persons are provided, where possible, with an adequate choice of where they live, a factor that needs to be built into policies and programmes. 																								In developing countries, and some countries with economies in transition, rapid demographic ageing is taking place in a context of continuing urbanization and a growing number of persons who are ageing in urban areas lack affordable housing and services. At the same time a large number of persons are ageing in isolation in rural areas, rather than in the traditional environment of an extended family. Left alone, they are often without adequate transportation and support systems. 																								In developed countries, the built environment and adequate transportation for older persons are also growing concerns. Housing developments are typically designed for young families who have their own transport. Transportation is problematic in rural areas because older persons rely more on public transport as they age and it is often inadequate in rural areas. In addition, some older persons may continue to live in houses that they are unable to maintain after their children have moved out or after a spouse has died.																								Objective 1: Promotion of ageing in place in the community with due regard to individual preferences and affordable housing options for older persons. 																								Actions: (a) Promote the development of age-integrated communities; (b) Coordinate multi-sectoral efforts to support the continued integration of older persons with their families and communities; (c) Encourage investment in local infrastructure, such as transportation, health, sanitation and security, designed to support multigenerational communities; (d) Introduce policies and support initiatives that ease access of older persons to goods and services; (e) Promote equitable allocation of public housing for older persons; (f) Link affordable housing with social support services to ensure the integration of living arrangements, long-term care and opportunities for social interaction; 																								(g) Encourage age-friendly and accessible housing design and ensure easy access to public buildings and spaces; (h) Provide older persons, their families and caregivers with timely and effective information and advice on the housing options available to them; (i) Ensure that housing provided for older persons takes appropriate account of their care and cultural needs; (j) Promote the growing continuum of housing options for older persons.

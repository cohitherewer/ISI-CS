 - Comparing China and India involves a wider debate on freedom  BHASKAR DUTTA The author teaches at the University  of Warwick, United Kingdom For much of the Seventies and  Eighties, development economists spent a lot of time and  energy comparing the economies of India and China, as well  as the vastly different experiences of the two countries.  In many ways, it was very natural to make this comparison.  Both countries were roughly similar in size, and until the  beginning of the Seventies, per capita incomes were similar,  though greater income disparities and the absence of comprehensive  safety nets meant that a significantly larger fraction of  the Indian population lived in poverty. Moreover, the two  countries embarked on the process of planned development  at more or less the same time. The dramatically different  political systems lent an added dimension to the debate,  for it was inevitable that comparisons between China and  India soon involved the wider issue of the relationship  between democracy and development. Unfortunately, the narrower issue  of ranking the two countries in terms of the usual yardsticks  of development was soon settled. The current stage of reforms  in China is usually traced to 1979. Soon after, the Chinese  economy began to record unbelievably rapid rates of growth  in per-capita incomes  and that too, not once or twice,  but year after year. Although India too has surpassed the  so-called Hindu rate of growth during the last decade and  a half, the vastly superior Chinese performance has meant  that their per-capita income is now roughly twice the Indian  figure. China has also out-performed India in terms of achievements  in the social sector. Life expectancy at birth in China  is comparable to that in developed countries, while adult  literacy is substantially higher than in India. Perhaps, that is why not much  is written nowadays about the comparative performance of  India and China. After all, one-sided contests are not exciting  and perhaps not worth commenting on. However, the recent  visit of the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has rekindled  interest in the bigger issue of whether democracy is inimical  to growth. For instance, the London-based The Economist  carries a special report on the growth experiences of  the two countries, and brings up the question of whether  the need to convince large cross-sections of society in  a democracy has constrained Indias rate of growth. Of course, an obvious problem  in generalizing from the comparative experiences of just  two countries is that neither can claim to be true representatives  of their respective groups. For instance, India is huge  and heterogeneous; with an extremely unwieldy political  structure where decision-making involves aggregating the  opinions of more than twenty ruling political parties. The  costs of democracy must be significantly higher in India  than in small countries where political power is shared  by a small number of parties. For the record, the only light  that rigorous cross-country analyses throw on this issue  is that the country specificities do matter. In other words,  once other differences between countries are taken into  account, there is no reason to believe that democracies  do better or worse than countries with a more autocratic  political structure. The absence of any firm relationship  between democracy and growth is not at all surprising. On  the one hand, hard decisions that are likely to antagonize  different vote-banks are easier to take in the absence of  electoral compulsions. Certainly, successive Indian governments  have not been able to embrace economic reforms with anywhere  near the degree of fervour that has been witnessed in China.  Every finance minister from Manmohan Singh onwards has announced  bold measures of change, only to withdraw them in the face  of staunch opposition from vested interests. On the other hand, electoral compulsions  should also stimulate improved performance while in office.  That is, incumbent governments should strive to impress  voters by their superior performance so as to improve their  chances of re-election. There is enough evidence that the  performance of incumbents does influence voting behaviour.  Of course, the incentives provided by the prospects of re-election  get diluted when there are a large number of political parties  sharing the spoils of office  perhaps this is one reason  why coalition governments seem to perform less efficiently  than one-party governments. In its extreme form, this also  suggests that totalitarian governments may squander public  resources for the personal aggrandizement of its rulers   there is only the possibility of mass uprisings to enforce  any kind of accountability. In fact, economists such as Amartya  Sen would argue that whether democracy is inimical to growth  is perhaps not even a relevant question. This school of  thought emphasizes that processes are just as important  as the final outcomes  the ends do not justify the means.  That is, freedom and democracy are important goals in  themselves because they enrich human lives, and so measuring  development solely in terms of per-capita incomes or even  wider concepts, which incorporate criteria such as levels  of achievement in health and education are inappropriate.  Even the freedom to make wrong choices is valuable. Perhaps, nothing illustrates the  intrinsic value of freedom better than Chinas attempts  to implement the one-child per family policy. In fact,  for a long time, both India and China have been trying to  curb the rates of growth of population in their countries.  In terms of concrete figures, China has been extremely successful  in carrying out its attempts to bring down the rate of growth  of population, while Indias efforts have met with only  limited success. For example, the Indian population in 1980  was 680 million, which was roughly 300 million fewer than  in China. By 2001, the difference had narrowed down to about  200 million.  This has been possible because  of the draconian policies followed in China in order to  achieve the countrys population policy. Families exceeding  the one-child quota are deprived of a large number of state  benefits  these are benefits which are essential in China.  Except for the period when Sanjay Gandhi was in control,  the Indian policy has used carrots more than sticks. This  has not been very successful, but surely only the bigoted  can express a preference for the stick over the carrot in  implementing decisions such as family size. Sen and others  also emphasize the instrumental importance of democratic  institutions such as a free press.  It has now been established that  around 30 million Chinese died in the famine which followed  the failure of the Great Leap Forward during 1958-61  the  largest recorded famine in history. Nothing resembling human  disaster of this magnitude can happen in India because the  free press in India would force the government to take appropriate  remedial actions.

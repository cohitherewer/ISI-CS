		 Friday, July 25, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Rambling for the good of the EmpireRambles and recollections of  an Indian official (Rupa, Rs 595) by Sir W.H.  Sleeman is an invaluable and entertaining reprint of  a mid-19th-century classic  the journals of an eminent  colonial administrator who rambled from the banks of the  Nerbudda to the Himalaya mountains in 1835-36, in search  of health, with his wife and little son. Sleeman was  based for most of his Indian career in Jabalpur as General  Superintendent of the operations for the Suppression of  Thuggee. The original editor, who puts in generous notes,  a bibliography and an index, explains why Sleeman was such  a good archivist: He thoroughly understood the peculiarities  of the various native races, and the characteristics which  distinguish them from the nations of Europe; while sympathetic  insight into Indian life had not orientalised him, nor had  it ever for one moment caused him to forget his position  and heritage as Englishman. This attitude of safe and discriminating  sympathy is the right attitude for the Englishman in India.  Sleeman was well versed in Arabic, Persian and Urdu and  also knew Latin, Greek and French.  Riot after riot: Reports on  caste and communal violence in India (Roli, Rs 195)  by M.J. Akbar is a collection of journalistic pieces  on incidents of mass violence in India over the last nine  years  RSS-inspired riots in Jamshedpur, the provincial  armed constabulary opening fire on 40,000 Muslims in Moradabad,  the killing of Harijans by Thakur Rajputs in UP, dacoit  raids in Bihar, starvation deaths in Kalahandi and the Gorkha  separatist movement. The last piece is called Bonfires  of the Heart: Notes from the Shadows of Ayodhya.  Loves perfumes (Penguin, Rs 200) by Rita  Rahman is a novel about a Carribean environmentalist and  Dutch civil servant who meet at the World Food Summit in the  Netherlands. The civil servant is insomniac and the environmentalist  knows a way of making him sleep, in exchange of which the  civil servant guides her through the cities of Europe. Kumari: The Virgin Goddess  (Roli, price not mentioned) is a book of postcard  photographs taken by Thomas L. Kelly and introdced by Carroll  Dunham and Daniel B. Haber. It depicts the rather discomfiting  Nepalese ritual of worshipping pre-pubertal girls, practised  for 700 years now, as incarnations of the goddess Taleju.  The written introduction provides lurid details of these  girls ruined childhood, and the little kumaris look  miserable in most of the photographs.

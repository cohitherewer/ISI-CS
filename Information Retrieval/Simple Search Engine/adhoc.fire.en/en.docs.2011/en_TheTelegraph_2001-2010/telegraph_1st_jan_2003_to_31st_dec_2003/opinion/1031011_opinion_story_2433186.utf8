		 Saturday, October 11, 2003  MYTH AND HISTORY
 - Talking about a nations glory is the easiest way to teach  its history  Andr Bteille The author is chairman, Centre for  Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta		 India's presentTwenty years ago, one of our more  exuberant public intellectuals introduced a collection of  his own essays by saying, I shall not grudge it if some  enterprising reviewer finds unconvincing history in the  following pages, as long as he finds in them convincing  myths. As I read those words, my stomach turned a little.  The declaration of preference for myth over history by a  recognized social scientist made me wonder when the pigeons  would come home to roost. They are now coming home to roost. Historians and social scientists  do not produce myths. At best, they provide the raw materials  from which others produce them. Those who provide the raw  materials for the production of myths are rarely able to  anticipate the form the finished product will take. It is  often far removed from the dreams of the providers of raw  materials. What makes a myth convincing is  different from what makes history or social science convincing.  Myths cannot be subjected to the same test of evidence to  which history and social science must submit. It is this  freedom from the test of evidence that appeals most to some  of our public intellectuals, and their tribe is increasing. The myth by which increasing numbers  of Indians are now willing or even eager to be convinced  is the myth of national greatness and glory. It is a seductive  myth but, like all myths, it simplifies the reality and  shows scant respect for contradictory evidence. It is far  from my argument that historians or social scientists should  not be patriotic, but they should not distort or disregard  the facts of the case. The difference between history and  myth is that in history, where the facts are unavailable,  the argument must rest without a conclusion, whereas a myth  must move to its inevitable conclusion, so where there are  no facts, they have to be invented. The natural inclination of teachers  of history in India, particularly school teachers, is towards  what may be called edifying history as against objective  or positive or scientific history. Talking about the  greatness and glory of a nation is the easiest way of teaching  history  or sociology  in an edifying way to the young.  It is easier to do this for the past than for the present,  so that teachers of sociology have a harder job than teachers  of history, particularly ancient history, where the facts  are vague, unclear and amenable to divergent interpretations.  In India, teachers do not like relating unpleasant facts  to the young, unless the unpleasant facts are about other  people. Indian civilization has great  achievements to its credit. Why should teachers of history  be loath to talk about them to their students? It is indeed  their duty to talk about these achievements provided they  take care to avoid too much exaggeration and embellishment.  Distortion begins when the teacher turns the spotlight only  on the achievements of his nation and always away from its  failings. There is no civilization that has only achievements  and no failings. The natural tendency in nationalist myth-making  is to embellish the achievements of the nation and to brush  its failings under the carpet. Perhaps the majority of teachers  would like to say to their students that India is a great  country and, as I have suggested, there is no harm in this  provided some moderation is maintained. Some go on from  there to say that India is not just great, it is the greatest,  and it is at this point that the falsification begins. It  is, of course, difficult to maintain that India is the greatest  in its present state, but one may, with a little effort,  persuade oneself and others that it was the greatest in  its pristine state. For the teacher who is a zealous nationalist,  history has more possibilities than sociology. The glory begins with the land.  India has, of course, been represented in song as a land  overflowing with milk and honey, and this is true of many  other countries as well. The question is, how far what is  commemorated in song should be taken as the literal truth  to be taught to students through text-books of history and  social studies. In a recent book, written for a wide readership,  India is represented as having the best of everything: the  best of sunshine and rainfall, the best rivers and mountains,  an abundance of every form of plant and animal life, and,  of course, inexhaustible stores of all the necessities of  everyday life. In this representation, the countrys  most valued resource is its traditional social life, animated  by tolerance, forbearance, fortitude, compassion and all  the other virtues that made India the envy of the rest of  the civilized world. The privileged site of these virtues  was the Indian village community where peace, prosperity  and goodwill among men prevailed. Reading all this, one  would get hardly any idea of the divisions of caste, the  practice of untouchability or the subordination of women;  and the representation is completely at odds with Dr Ambedkars  depiction of the Indian village as a sink of localism,  a den of ignorance, narrow-mindedness and communalism. Dr Ambedkar notwithstanding, more  and more students are being taught by their teachers about  the greatness and glory of India. After learning so much  about Indias pristine condition, some of them might wish  to know why there is so much poverty, inequality and discord  in India today. Why is Indias present so completely different  from its past? Those who read the edifying text-books also  read newspapers and watch television, and it is difficult  to reconcile the messages that come from these different  sources. There is an obvious and attractive  explanation for the mismatch between the splendour of the  past and the squalor of the present, and that is the intervention  of colonial rule. The same text-books that represent the  India of the past as a land overflowing with milk and honey  also represent colonial rule as a period of relentless plunder,  spoliation and degradation. Myths have need not only of  the forces of light but also of the forces of darkness.  In the last few decades, the best liberal and radical historians  have trained their heaviest guns against the misdeeds of  colonial rule to which all of Indias present ills are attributed.  This monotonically anti-colonial historiography has made  it easy for the traditionalists to represent Indias past  as a period of glory and grandeur. The British were no doubt alien  intruders who disrupted a contented and harmonious way of  life. But were they the first or only intruders to do so?  What our radical and liberal historians have started is  being continued further back into the past by other historians.  A recent account of the pristine greatness of India and  its spoliation by the British ends by saying that perhaps  the gloom had set in earlier, around AD 1000. Who were the  bearers of this pre-British gloom? Could they have been  Afghans, or Turks? The myth of the destruction of everything  that was good in India by the British has extensions that  may not all be pleasing to those who have contributed to  its making. But the creators of myths do not expect to be  asked to take responsibility for their creations.

		 Friday, May 30, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Without becoming a jellySelf (Faber,  4.99)  by Yann Martel is an early novel by this Man Booker  Prize winning author, written mercifully before his discovery  of god in Life of Pi. As a result, this is a far  more intelligent and complex novel, exploring with considerable  sophistication the fluidities of the self and of the body,  the former so prone to unpredictable transformations  linguistic,  emotional, and sexual. There are some Shandian gimmicks  with typography, which could have been avoided without compromising  the links which the novel makes between multilingualism  and sexual ambivalence, even androgyny. This book is quite  consciously in the tradition of Virginia Woolfs Orlando  and Patrick Whites The Twyborn Affair, but unable  to achieve the brilliant lightness of the former, or the  tragic gravity of the latter. Martels protagonist lives  out much of the indeterminacy of the self through the experience  of deliciously salacious sex  shades of Myra Breckinridge  here, but Martel is not as naturally wicked as Gore  Vidal. The war on terror (LeftWord,  Rs 125) by Ninan Koshy is an analysis of the  projects and doctrines of Bushs War on Terror in response  to the events of 9/11. Koshy deals primarily with the relationship  between globalization and this war, as well as the imperial  features of the world order projected by Bush and Blair  . His perspective is largely Asian, given that the theatre  of the War stretches from west Asia to northeast Asia.  The main thesis and some of its elaborations are indeed  valuable, but largely rehearses what is by now a well-established  critique of American unilateralism: The new doctrines and  strategies show how US policy has moved from isolationism  to Cold War containment to a mad rush by the US to become  an overt military empire. Guru by your bedside: The teachings  of a modern seer (Penguin, Rs 250) recollected  by S.D. Pandey is about the charismatic spirituality  of a Vaishnav vairagi sadhu of Western extraction. Snakebites  and the India-China war set the writer, rather recollector,  and his wife on the path to British-aircraft-engineer-turned  guru Ashish Das sanctum sanctorum in the Kumaon hills.  Ashish Das sadhana jivan is built on the idea of  transcendence through acceptance, but without becoming  a jelly, as the master puts it intriguingly. A pious combination  of syncretic mysticism and dream analysis is used to arrive  at such profundities as the path which is endless must also  be beginningless.  Identity, hegemony, resistance:  towards a social history of conversions in Orissa, 1800-2000  (Three Essays Collective, Rs 90) by Biswamoy  Pati explores the problem of religious conversion through  a study of the evolution of the caste system in colonial  and post-colonial Orissa. The relationship between the consolidation  of Brahminism and the gradual disappearance of adivasis  in Orissa is elaborated by Pati into a condensed critique  of Hindutva. This is a learned and incisive monograph, although  full of grammatical and printing errors.Journey to Persia and Iraq:  1932 (Visva- Bharati, Rs 150) by Rabindranath  Tagore is the first full translation of Parasya-Yatri,  Tagores account of his visit to Persia on the invitation  of the king of Iran, Reza Shah Pehlavi. Tagore flew the  Dutch Air Mail Service, and stopped for lunch in Karachi.  The extent to which the Islamic and Zoroastrian civilizations  were integral to Tagores cosmopolitan intellectual and  political being becomes clear in this travelogue. His route  took in Bushire, Shiraz, Persepolis, Teheran and then Iraq,  the last stop being Baghdad.

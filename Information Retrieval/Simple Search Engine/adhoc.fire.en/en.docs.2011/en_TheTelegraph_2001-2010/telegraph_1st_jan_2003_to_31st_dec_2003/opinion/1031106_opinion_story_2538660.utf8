 															- document Extracts from the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, April 2002 to be concluded				 	 Freedom from hunger																								Objective 1: Reduc- tion of poverty among older persons. Actions: (a) Reduce the proportion of persons living in extreme poverty by half by 2015; (b) Include older persons in policies and programmes to reach the poverty-reduction target; (c) Promote equal access for older persons to employment and income-generation opportunities... (d) Ensure that the particular needs of older women, the oldest old, older persons with disabilities and those living alone are specifically addressed... 																								(e) Develop age...and gender-relevant poverty indicators as an essential means to identify the needs of poor older women and encourage the use of existing indicators of poverty so that the review is carried out according to age group and gender; (f) Support innovative programmes to empower older persons, particularly women, to increase their contributions to and benefit from development efforts to eradicate poverty; (g) Enhance international cooperation to support national efforts to eradicate poverty... in order to achieve sustainable social and economic support for older persons; (h) Strengthen the capacity of developing countries to address the obstacles that hinder their participation in an increasingly globalized economy in order to assist them in their efforts to eradicate poverty, in particular among older persons. 																								Income security and social protection/social security measures... include informal as well as highly structured schemes. They are part of a foundation for economic prosperity and social cohesion. 																								Globalization, structural adjustment programmes, fiscal constraints and a growing older population are often perceived as exerting pressure on formal social protection/social security systems. Sustainability in the provision of adequate income security is of great importance. In developing countries with limited coverage, formal systems of social protection/social security, populations are vulnerable to market shocks and individual misfortunes that strain informal family support. In countries with economies in transition, economic transformations have impoverished whole segments of the population, in particular older persons and many families with children. Where it has occurred, hyperinflation has rendered pensions, disability insurance, health benefits and savings almost worthless. 																								Appropriate social protection/social security measures are required to address the feminization of poverty, in particular among older women. 																								Objective 1: Promotion of programmes to enable all workers to acquire basic social protection/social security, including where applicable, pensions, disability insurance and health benefits. 																								Actions: (a) Develop and implement policies aimed at ensuring that all persons have adequate economic and social protection during old age; (b) Strive to ensure gender equality in social protection/social security systems; (c) Ensure, where appropriate, that social protection/social security systems cover an increasing proportion of the formal and informal working population; (d) Consider innovative social protection/social security programmes for persons working in the informal sector; 																								(e) Introduce programmes to promote employment of low-skilled older workers, giving access to social protection/social security systems; (f) Strive to ensure the integrity, sustainability, solvency and transparency of pension schemes, and, where appropriate, disability insurance; (g) Establish a regulatory framework for private and supplementary pension and, where appropriate, disability insurance; (h) Provide advice and counselling services for older persons regarding all areas of social protection/social security.

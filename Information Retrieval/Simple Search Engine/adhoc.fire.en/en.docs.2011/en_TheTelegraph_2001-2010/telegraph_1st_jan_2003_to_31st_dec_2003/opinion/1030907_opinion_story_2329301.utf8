The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, September 07, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Hire and misfire				 																																																				Sir  It might have been the brainchild of the N. Chandrababu Naidu, but it is strange that none present at the chief ministers meet had the brain to question the practicality of the move (CMs discover contract virtue, Sept 3). The system of hiring government employees on a contractual basis in no way guarantees work efficiency. In fact, it doubtful whether the denial of the much sought after benefits of job security and pension would make a better worker of the typical government servant. Besides, five-year contracts havent made Indian governments any the less ineffective.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, S. Mukherjee, Calcutta
				 																Text case				 																																																				Sir  The objections raised by certain sections of the minority community in West Bengal over the recital of the Ganesh bandana in the latest edition of Kishalay are meaningless (Ganesh Bandana in textbook stirs storm, August 22). How will a few lines of Ganesh Bandana affect their faith? The allegation that both teachers and students will face a lot of discomfort while reading the chapter is irrelevant. The lines are being asked to be recited like panchali because the tribal Chou- dancers read it that way. The apprehension that the government is attempting to corrupt minority religions is baseless. The left government does not seem to be trying to propagate any particular religious view. In fact, the inclusion of the passage on Ganesh Bandana is probably meant to make students aware of their own culture. There is no reason for the book to be withdrawn.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Surajit Basak, Calcutta

 Sir  Why should children be  taught religion, and with that religious differences, so  early in life? Did the government assume that its Kishalay  would be read without as much as a protest from the  minority community? Given the furore the edition has generated,  it is natural that the controversial chapter will cause  resentment among parents and thereby discomfort in the classroom.  The government would be well-advised to withdraw the text.  Yours faithfully,																															
Jyotirmoy Haldar, 

				 																																																				Calcutta				 																																																				Sir  Books like Kishalay are meant for students of the lower classes and contain many mythological stories which may have religious associations. It would be wrong to regard these lessons as offensive. The education imparted at the primary level is aimed at widening the knowledge base of the young in the form of stories. Those studying in missionary schools have to study stories from the Bible as a part of their moral science syllabus. No objections are raised against this. It is sad that the inclusion of the Ganesh bandana has raised such a storm. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avishek Ganguly, Howrah

				 																																																				Sir  The secular character of India will not be threatened if Kishalay is read in the primary classes. Knowledge cannot be restricted by religious or sectarian boundaries. Dont Hindus and Christians read the Quran? Secularism and minority appeasement are two entirely different things, although they are easily confused in India. Christians and Buddhists in this country are less sensitive than Muslims about what is perceived as threat to their religion. It goes without saying that such threat perceptions are often wrong.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir  The panchali is a form  of recitation common to Bengals villages and is part of  the syncretic rural culture. Panchali audiences have always  drawn crowds both from the Hindu and Muslim communities.  Why should the Ganesh bandana read out as panchali suddenly  cause a furore? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C. Chatterjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Given the highly volatile communal atmosphere in the state, an avowedly secular government like the Left Front should have avoided hurting the religious sentiments of the minorities. Why should Muslim students be forced to recite the Ganesh bandana in the primary classes? Have Hindu students ever been made to recite verses from the Quran?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
M. Aslam, Calcutta

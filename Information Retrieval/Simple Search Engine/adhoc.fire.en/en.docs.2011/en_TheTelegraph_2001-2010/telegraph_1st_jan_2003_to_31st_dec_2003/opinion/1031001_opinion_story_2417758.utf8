		 Wednesday, October 01, 2003  THE VANISHING VILLAGE
 - The village is no longer a site in which futures can be  planned  DIPANKAR GUPTA The author is professor, Jawaharlal  Nehru University, New Delhi The Indian village is not what  it used to be, and even further from what it has been for  long imagined to be. There are unambiguous statistics that  point to the falling rates of growth in agriculture, and  to the increasing exodus from country to town. On top of  this we have the phenomenon of non-farm employment whose  scale has increased tremendously over the years. It is estimated  today that about 24 per cent of villagers are engaged in  non-agricultural occupations. This is not a small number,  and in all likelihood, it is probably a conservative estimate.  Even more striking is the fact that over 45 per cent of  the rural net domestic product comes from non-farm activities. While these gross statistics do  suggest a whittling down of the importance of agriculture  as the mainstay of Indian society, there is in addition  a general undermining of values and practices that have  their origins in the villages and are imbued with the so-called  rural ethos. There was a time, not too long ago, when  a Jat farmer in Uttar Pradesh or Punjab, would proudly  proclaim that farming was the noblest of all occupations.  If not farming, then the army, but never a nondescript salaried  job. Today this swagger is missing amongst them. They want  an urban foothold, and would even condescend to take up  occupations in towns and cities that they would not deign  to perform in their own villages. The profundity of changes in rural  India is not fully captured by census figures, or by statistical  surveys. Useful though they are, it is necessary to comprehend  the depth of the disenchantment that prevails in the villages.  This disenchantment is on a variety of fronts. Indian agriculture  has always lurched from crisis to crisis. If the monsoons  are good then there are floods, if they are bad there are  droughts; if the production of mangoes is excellent then  there is a glut and prices fall, if the onion crops fail  then that too brings tears. The artisanal nature of agriculture  has always kept farmers on tenterhooks, not knowing quite  how to manage their economy, except to play it by (y)ear. Even in green revolution areas,  where there has been a spectacular increase in mechanization  and chemical inputs, the dependence on the vagaries of the  weather continues. This is further aggravated by the insufficiency,  and irregularity, of electrical supply and other infrastructural  inputs. Put together these can throw the best agricultural  calculations out of gear. It is not surprising then that  whenever the occasion arises, villagers are more than willing  to up and leave for a future outside their mud walls and  in fields as distant from agriculture as industrial labour.  When they step into urban jobs they are usually absorbed  in the organized sector, notorious for its iniquities. But  this too is preferable to living in the village. It is not  as if the availability of non-farm jobs is, in most cases,  an outcome of agricultural prosperity. In a large number  of cases, the phenomenon of distress diversification must  also be taken into account. The rural economy is not a viable  entity any longer, and this shows in the temper of the village.  Nowhere else does one find the level of hopeless disenchantment  as one does in the rural regions of India. In urban slums  there is squalor, there is filth and crime, but there is  hope and the excitement that tomorrow might be quite different  from today. Indeed, it is hard to meet a villager  today who would want to be a farmer if given an opportunity  elsewhere. Indeed, there are few rural institutions that  have not been mauled severely from within. The joint family  is disappearing, the rural caste hierarchy is losing its  tenacity, and the much-romanticized harmony of village life  is now exposed for the sham it perhaps always was. If anything,  it is perhaps B.R. Ambedkars analysis of the Indian village  that strikes the truest of all. It was Ambedkar who said  that the village was a cesspool of degradation, corruption  and worse. If village India was able to carry on in spite  of all this in the past, it was because there was little  option for most people, rich or poor, outside the confines  of the rural space.  That another world has opened  up outside the village is what threatens rural culture the  most. Given the nature of intervention that modern democratic  politics and economics make, it is not surprising that rural  India has lost its charisma so comprehensively. With the  abolition of landlordism and the introduction of adult franchise  (the two must necessarily go hand in hand), old social relations  that dominated the countryside are today in a highly emaciated  form, when not actually dead. Roughly 85 per cent of landholdings  are below 5 acres and about 63 per cent are below even three  acres. What land reforms and land redistribution could not  do, demography and sub-division of holdings have done to  land ownership. Where are the big landlords? There are some,  but they are few and far between. But does this make the  village an egalitarian utopia? Far from it. Medium-sized owner cultivators  contend against landless labourers, both economically and  socially. While the rigidities of the caste systems no longer  operate in their pristine form, caste prejudices and identities  die hard. The stigma of tradition sits incubus like on social  relations even if the prescriptions of tradition cannot  be followed with equal facility these days. Other than the  lack of economic opportunities, it is the nature of social  relations in rural India that drives many poorer castes  and classes out of the village. Often, landless labourers get  back to the village during harvesting season, for that is  when they can demand and get higher wages. As family labour  is insufficient at this peak time, owner cultivators are  dependent on hired labour, and, beyond a point, they are  unable to hold their wages down. But these considerations  are relevant only for a short duration and the season is  soon over. Clearly, the poorer one is, the greater the temptation  to up and leave the village before the sun finally sets. Where landholdings are so fragmented  there is little scope for agricultural regeneration. Planners  would be happy if agricultural production can be sustained  year after year, and elated if there is a modest increase  of even 1 per cent. Last year, there was in fact a negative  growth rate. In small plots there is always a preponderance  of family labour and the Chayanovian logic of balancing  drudgery and needs usually operates in such cases. But for  that to happen without emotional philippics, the needs horizon  must curve within the village perimeter. Only then is the  family farm a precious gift to be harvested in perpetuity.  But now needs have escalated and  the family farm is no longer what it was earlier cut out  to be. It cannot support the ambition to be where the bright  lights are. Nor can family farms provide employment to the  landless youth in the villages. Therefore, no matter which  way one looks at it, as owner cultivators or as landless  labourers, the village is no longer a site where futures  can be planned. Of course, wealthy landed people  often have considerable political leverage in villages and  form a vested interest group. While many of them draw their  wealth and esteem from the village, they either live in  cities, or they recreate an affluent urban ambience in their  rural setting. In stark contrast to the poorer villagers  with urban aspirations, when the rural rich engage with  the outside world they do so from a position of relative  strength. Yet, they too see their future outside the village,  or in interacting with the town in enterprises that require  rural and urban inputs. It is against this background that  the culture surrounding agriculture must be understood.  This culture is not a stable one. History has not left behind  a consistent legacy, nor does rural culture have a temporal  overhang that is safely cantilevered on present commitments.  Agriculture is an economic residue that generously accommodates  non-achievers resigned to a life of sad satisfaction. The  villager is as bloodless as the rural economy is lifeless.  From rich to poor, the trend is to leave the village, and,  if that entails going abroad, then so be it. All this may sound a trifle alarming,  but this is what Indias villages are telling us whether  or not we are inclined to listen to these rustic murmurs.

 P.K. Vasudeva India has warned World Trade Organization  members that there may be a backlash in the developing countries  if the economic reforms decisions being taken by the developed  countries are ever perceived to be an imposition on the  people of the developing nations. Such setbacks can derail  the whole process of multilateral negotiations and bring  discredit to the WTO.  The Indian disinvestment minister,  Arun Shourie, had asked the WTO countries, at the three-day  informal meeting of 24 trade ministers in Montreal, to stick  to the Doha development agenda and be cautious in moving  forward. The DDA is the only tool for the 145 WTO members  to tackle sensitive issues like agriculture and trade-related  aspects of intellectual property rights on public health  between the poor and the industrialized members.  Shourie stressed the importance  of agriculture as Indias key concern in the WTO negotiations.  Referring to the proposed special products, which are of  interest to the developing countries, he emphasized that  these need to be combined with special safeguard measures  with a suitable trigger mechanism, in terms of both import  volume and price, in order to protect farmers interests. Field work The string of warnings being issued  by the developing countries is the latest indication that  there are many obstacles in the way of the effective and  timely implementation of the DDA. These countries contend  that the multilateral trade negotiations are going nowhere  in view of the intractable stand maintained by the developed  countries. The Cancun ministerial meet may end in another  fiasco if things continue to move this way.  It is also strange that even though  definite stances have not been taken by the member countries,  a draft of the Cancun ministerial text is already under  circulation. This may play a crucial role in the final decision-making.  On agriculture, which is the most  important issue on the agenda of the developing countries,  including India, the official report on the Nyon meeting  of developing countries, says, Agriculture is the make-or  break issue for the successful conclusion of Doha round  of (multilateral) trade negotiations. However, much time  has already passed without any major breakthrough which  could set the tune for future trade liberalizations. The  WTO members need to agree on this issue at the fifth WTO  ministerial at Cancun.  Reviewing the WTOs progress on  the discussions on market access, export subsidies (competition)  and domestic support to agriculture at the mini ministerial  conferences held at Tokyo, Cairo and Montreal, it is apparent  that the negotiations on agriculture lack the necessary  compromises on several issues. Problem areas Though an agreement on the contentious  issue of agricultural trade liberalization is likely to  be struck between the European Union and the United States  of America, potential benefits for India and other developing  countries are yet to be ascertained. A compromise on agriculture  has become a possibility after the EU, the biggest defender  of farm subsidies, drew up an internal agreement on a moderate  reduction of subsidies by its members. Even then, a US-EU  pact on agriculture portends that member countries, especially  the developing ones, will be pushed to a compromise on other  DDA issues.  Some sensitive issues that have  been included in the Cancun agenda are those of trade facilitation,  government procurement, investment and competition policy  and, perhaps the most controversial one, expansion of the  WTOs powers by negotiating treaties in new areas such as  foreign investment. Even as India continues to argue that  these issues should not be part of the DDAs agenda for  negotiation, there are chances that the developing countries  will buckle under the pressure mounted on them by the developed  ones.  A successful ministerial conference  is important. Failure to end the stalemate will challenge  the very legitimacy of the Doha round of trade negotiations.  As a result, the credibility of the WTO may be at stake.

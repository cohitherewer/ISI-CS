		 Friday, June 20, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Thoughts on language and terrorism On language (Penguin,  Rs 325) by Noam Chomsky brings together in an  omnibus edition two of the authors most well-known and  influential works, Language and Responsibility and  Reflections on Language. The first work clarifies  Chomskys position on politics, and his moral and linguistic  thinking. The second develops the case of universal grammar  and includes analyses of the important debates on language.  For those non-linguists interested in Chomskys politics,  this volume is an illuminating guide to an understanding  of Chomskys mind. Osama Bin Laden: King of terror  or saviour or Islam? (Pustak Mahal, Rs 120) by  Luis S.R. Vas is another addition to the tide of bin  Laden books. There is no variation in the routine: Osamas  background and career, the workings of al Qaida, CIA and  FBI reports, media coverage, the meaning of fundamentalism,  are all headlined and sub-titled into their appropriate  places. It is not yet clear, however, whether it is bin  Ladens mysterious power or the USs need to project The  Enemy that has given Osama pride of place in the terrorism  industry.																												Dev and Simran (Penguin, Rs 195) by Eunice de Souza is an occasionally witty narrative about a group of people bumbling through the pains and puzzlements of ordinary life. De Souza is refreshing because she does not search for philosophical profundities or perfect closures, while her lightly sardonic touch gives her tale an even surface.																												In the heart of the Brahmaputra and other stories (Rupa, Rs 50) by Sarat Chandra Goswami is a neat selection of tales from one of the pioneering writers of the modern Assamese short story. The five stories here display a striking range of mood and landscape and of the experiences of despair, desire, wisdom, patience, folly and pain. Ably translated by Gayatri Bhattacharji, these few stories are enough to establish Goswamis adroitness in handling the form.An agnostics apology and other  essays (Rupa, Rs 195) by Leslie Stephen  puts together the English critics most incisive writings  on belief and agnosticism. A leading agnostic of his time,  Stephen popularized through his title essay, written in  1900, the term agnosticism, which had been first used by  Thomas Huxley in 1870. The lack of an introduction is sadly  felt in collections of this kind.

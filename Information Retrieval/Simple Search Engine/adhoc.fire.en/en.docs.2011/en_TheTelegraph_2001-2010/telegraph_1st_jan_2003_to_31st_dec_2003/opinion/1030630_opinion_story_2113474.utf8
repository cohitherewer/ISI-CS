 - Allegations of sleaze in a company require investigation  and public scrutiny  COMMENTARAO / S.L. RAO The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission raoslhotmail.com In the early Eighties, S.P. Acharya,  the chairman and managing director of Shaw Wallace Limited,  fought valiantly to protect his companys shareholders from  the predatory Manu Chhabria. He lost and quietly retired.  The Chhabria years, in this as in many other companies that  he bought, are well known for corporate decline and loss  of shareholder value. Shaw Wallace, once a cash rich company  and a blue chip, is a shadow of its past glory. Ultimately  Acharya gave in because that appeared to be the will of  the regulators and shareholders. If shareholders decide  to change a good management that has been producing results,  it is their prerogative. They own the company.  It was also around this time that  Britannia was sold by a fuddy-duddy British company, Huntley-Palmer,  to the American Nabisco. The giant American cigarette company,  R.J. Reynolds, then bought Nabisco, and Britannia came under  its control. Barbarians at the gate gave control over  Britannia to Rajan Pillai who was backed by the former RJR  chairman, Ross Johnson. When they fell out, the managing  director was sacked. He enabled the entry of the present  principal shareholders, Bombay Dyeing. Danon, the French  foods giant was the other main shareholder. Together they  brought him back as managing director, and he stayed for  almost ten years.  Principal shareholders in India  are usually Indian families, banks and financial institutions,  mostly state-owned, or foreign companies that own large  chunks of shares. These, and especially the last two, control  the companies and take all decisions. The remaining shareholders  have little choice and hope that they will benefit if principal  shareholders and the concerned companies benefit from the  connection.  It is for this reason that there  are regulators like the securities and exchange board of  India, the department of company affairs and the company  law board, investigative agencies like income-tax, enforcement  directorate, and so on, and new corporate governance norms  like that of independent directors. These are supposed to  ensure that everybodys interests are protected and that  shareholder groups that have control over companies use  it in a manner that is within the law and benefits all shareholders,  the company and society.  The happenings at Tata Finance  Limited paint a classic picture of how large controlling  shareholders must behave. An errant managing director was  given a chance to explain, then sacked, criminal charges  were filed, the shareholders were kept informed and the  principal shareholders pumped in funds to safeguard the  companys survival and the interests of the other shareholders. The happenings at Britannia in  the last few weeks are a more normal picture of how controlling  shareholders and regulators behave in similar situations.  Serious allegations have appeared in the media against the  managing director. Even bills and expense vouchers have  been shown. He is supposed to have spent large amounts of  company money on television serials that featured his actress  wife, given advertising film contracts to individuals without  going through the procedure of tendering and of lowest quotations  getting the contracts. There are rumours of commissions  on a corporate takeover and sale of a company division,  of personal expenditures on company account far in excess  of those permitted by shareholders in approving his contract,  and other similar allegations.  It does not require a Sherlock  Holmes to presume that these details could have reached  the media only from controlling shareholders and the remaining  top management. But shareholders have not been formally  told how much the loss to the company is. Since the managing  director was summarily sacked, the amounts must be substantial  and the nature of the offences extremely serious. The money  lost rightfully belongs to all shareholders. They must be  told how much was lost. Normally media-conscious regulators  and investigating agencies have so far not said or done  anything about the charges.  This is not a case of shareholders  versus managers. The principal shareholders of Britannia  have the power to sack a successful managing director if  they can carry the majority of shareholders with them. The  media allegations suggest that there is much more to it  than a battle for succession or ego of the principal shareholders.  Misuse of company funds cheats shareholders. There must  be a genuine attempt to recover the stolen or misused funds.  The shareholders in the general meeting must ratify the  sacking of the managing director. Criminal charges must  be filed if the facts warrant it. The company must reassure  shareholders and others that systems and controls are in  place that prevent such misuse of power. None of this has  happened so far. A long line of able managing directors  and managers built Britannia. The outgoing managing director  has served the company as managing director for ten years.  In this period of fast economic growth, he has also added  to shareholder value. Britannia shares are worth a lot more  today and shareholders have gained by good dividends. The  companys products command high market shares. Shareholders  have to worry whether all this is now in jeopardy. This is a company in the consumer  products market. The challenge for such products is to continue  sales growth and maintain high margins. Marketing, advertising,  distribution and promotion are their tools for growth. There  is no magic formula that can say how much of expenditure  will give what results. Intuition, hunch, gut-feel, creativity,  imagination of exceptional managers and their support staff  hit on the right mix that produces results.  Enormous expenditures might result  in little effect on sales and market share. There is then  nothing to show for the expenditures except a few worthless  advertising film prints, press clippings, point of purchase  material and hoardings. Analysts can pontificate but there  is no way to be sure as to what will be the results of the  expenditure. A managing director and his managers take big  risks with shareholder funds. When it works they are heroes.  When it does not they are in danger of being discarded.  No internal audit committee or auditors are competent to  judge whether a particular film producer should have been  given a film contract instead of someone else. The proof  lies only in the results. What they can do and probably  do not is to check with other companies whether the amount  paid was comparable to that paid by the others.  Regulators exist to ensure that  there is no misuse or abuse of the trust that shareholders  have placed in managing director and controlling shareholders.  In the instance of Britannia, they have so far shown little  sign of activity. Nor have the other powerful shareholders  like the state-owned financial institutions.  If the managing director was not  adequately compensated legally, he could have protested  or left for a better job. But inadequate remuneration does  not seem to have been the issue here. It is difficult to  believe that a managing director who is alleged to have  taken a lot more out of the company than he was allowed  by the shareholders, in many imaginative ways, could have  done so without the knowledge of senior managers, auditors,  and even the controlling shareholders.  Families that control businesses  have ways of getting information on what is going on within  the company. They meet managers, big suppliers of goods  and services, talk to competitors, investment analysts and  others, and study what the media has to say about their  company and its managers. Britannias managing director  has been frequently in the news for a variety of social  and business reasons. This company has been much written  about. Surely a lifestyle that was felt not to be in keeping  with that of a working managing director would have been  noticed and investigated a long time ago? Or was it that  the controlling shareholders permitted many of the now discovered  illegal expenses? There appears to be an attempt  by some to say that under-the-table expenses are permissible  if they are with the permission of the controlling shareholders.  Even if that had some justification in the old days of high  taxes and limited remuneration, they are totally unjustifiable  in these more liberal times. The sleaze that has been alleged  makes this a case for investigation and public scrutiny.  It reflects badly on professional employee managers, controlling  principal shareholders, regulators and others. With all  the new stress on corporate governance and social responsibility,  we must not allow this story to wind down without getting  at the facts and dealing with whoever has misbehaved.

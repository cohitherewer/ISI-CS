The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, January 05, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Beyond motherhood				 																																																				Sir  Indian women do not need Murli Manohar Joshi, of all people, to defend them (Fair is foul for pious Joshis mother sex, Jan 3). Joshi might think he is according women a rare respect by referring to them as the mother sex, but many would find the description as limiting and nearly as condescending as fair sex. After all, there is more to women than motherhood, much as it may shock our holier-than-thou minister. But perhaps it is only by seeing them in terms of their reproductive functions that chauvinists like Joshi can deal with the modern woman.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
S.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

				 																Strike a chord				 																																																				Sir  The lawyers strike in West Bengal is a glaring example of an artificial problem. The Supreme Court has already declared the strike illegal and said that all grievances must be settled in accordance with legal provisions. The lawyers plea that they are fighting to protect the interests of clients sounds like a cruel joke when one considers the number of poor litigants who have become bankrupt because of the advocates exorbitant fees and endless tarrying. It is a pity that there are no fixed rates for lawyers fees. It is also rumoured that public prosecutors, deputed to defend the government or fight cases for poor defendants sometimes even ask for money from their clients. 				 																																																				In short, lawyers have no moral locus standi to protest.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
N.K. Ghosh, Purulia

				 																																																				Sir  Soli J. Sorabjis call to set up an institution to go into the alleged misdemeanours of judges as well as check unprofessional practices like unpunctuality and needlessly dragging their feet over cases is a timely gesture. Serious cases of corruption and high-handedness have been levelled against judges in recent times. Ironically, litigants are fined for not complying with the orders of the court in time but there is no mechanism to penalize erring judges. As Sorabji recommends, there could be a national judicial commission with the prime minister, leader of the opposition and retired Supreme Court judges as nominees, which could be empowered to probe and punish erring judges based on complaints against them by the general public. This will ensure the legislature has some say in the appointment of judges and their functioning. Also all high court judges must be appointed from outside their home states in order to check nepotism and favouritism.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.C. Agrawal, Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Are the lawyers not afraid of offending the court that they continue to strike despite the apex courts ruling against it?				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Ronen Sen, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Kamini Jaiswal may be a good and sincere advocate but she has no right to accuse all lawyers of mercenary instincts (Strike the right balance, Dec 21). All lawyers are not rich and hence are understandably worried about losing clients. They must explain to the apex court that they are fighting for a just cause. The government cannot just increase levies at random to make up for its own bad accounting. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
S.S. Almal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Hunger strikes, like the ones undertaken by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, harmed no one except the one conducting it, but they managed to shake the British Empire. In contrast, the lawyers strike benefits no one but the lawyers themselves. No wonder Kamini Jaiswal is so upset with them.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
C.R. Das, Calcutta

				 																Change of face				 																																																				Sir  Can we please have a break from photographs of Nilanjana Bhowmick, Pallabi Chatterjee and Moon Moon Sen and her two daughters? Readers are really tired of seeing their faces everyday in The Telegraph.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
C. Chatterjee, Chandannagar

				 																																																				Sir  The Telegraph must publish a daily train reservation status as is done in every other major newspaper of the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
R. Chatterjee, Calcutta

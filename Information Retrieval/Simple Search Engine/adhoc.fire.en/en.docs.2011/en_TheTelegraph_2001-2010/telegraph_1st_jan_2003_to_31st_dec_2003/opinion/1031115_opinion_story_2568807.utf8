The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, November 15, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																For the love of law				 																																																				Sir  Which Hollywood couples favourite pastime is litigation? Undoubtedly the Douglases  Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, that is (Zeta-Jones threatens suit on diet claims, Nov 13). No sooner is a case disposed of by the court than the couple is at its doors again with another. Two peoples love for legal wrangles would have been quite alright had they not taken up so much space on the foreign pages of our newspapers, probably at the expense of far more important international news. The media could learn a lesson from the court, which recently awarded the couple only a fraction of what they had sought.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Gunjan Shah, Calcutta
				 																Unequal music				 																																																				Sir  There seems to be nothing wrong with Dev Anand being inspired to make a film on the sitar player, Ravi Shankar, and his daughter, Norah Jones, after the latter won five Grammy awards (Norah voices Shankar outrage, Oct 7). The problem seems to be Anands decision to focus on the tortured relationship between the father and the estranged daughter. Joness ire and hurt are understandable, but when Anoushka and Sukanya Shankar insist that nobody knows the real story since it is a private affair, then it becomes hard to swallow. Hasnt Anoushka herself written a book which throws light on this episode? Ravi Shankar has always been known for the colourful life he chose to lead. His relationships have fed the gossip columns for a long time. It is rather foolish to claim after all this that Dev Anand has made public a well-kept secret. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Phani Bhusan Saha, Durgapur

				 																																																				Sir  Norah Jones is entirely justified in saying that her relationship with her father, Ravi Shankar, is a personal matter. Given their celebrity status, it has probably occurred to her that she cannot avoid the public glare. What she can do is to ensure that the filmmaker, Dev Anand, does not turn the real-life drama into a typical song-and-dance Hindi film. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Asim Jana, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Why is Dev Anand so eager to make a film on the reconciliation between Ravi Shankar and Norah Jones, focussing on their troubled relationship? What Dev Anand is attempting to do amounts to dragging a familys private affairs into the public realm and cashing in on them. Also, Norah Joness career has just begun. Who can say that this film will not adversely affect her career? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Roohi Yasmin, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Dev Anand may be a popular and respected actor turned filmmaker. But he can also be a pest at times. Does he think he is doing a service to Ravi Shankar and his family by filming their story? Nobody could have put him in his place better than Anoushka Shankar, who simply said: What a jerk!				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mohua Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The news that a film called Dara: The Hero is being made by a sister outfit of the Bajrang Dal about Dara Singh, the murderer of Graham Staines and his two young sons, is appalling. To glorify a man who murdered three innocent people so mercilessly is a blot on the face of humanity. If glorifying a villain is not criminal enough, the film is bound to increase communal tension in the country. If there is such a thing as a censor board, it should ensure that the film never sees the light of day. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Prashant Solomon, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  Why should Raveena Tandons appointment as the chairperson of the Childrens Film Society of India raise eyebrows (Fun, funds and friends hope for children films, Oct 9)? She is not a new face in Bollywood, but an experienced and talented actor. The Childrens Film Society needs someone with her kind of enthusiasm and enterprise. Veterans like Sai Paranjpe and Jaya Bachchan, who have held the post in the past, cannot be said to have achieved a great deal. The fact that Tandon has already noted the societys shortage of funds shows her concern, as do her plans to exploit her Bollywood connections. Her emphasis on quality, rather than quantity, sounds promising. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

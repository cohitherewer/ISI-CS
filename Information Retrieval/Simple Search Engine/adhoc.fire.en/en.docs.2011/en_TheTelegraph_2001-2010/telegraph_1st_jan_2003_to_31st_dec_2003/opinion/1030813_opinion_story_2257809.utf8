		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 BAN QUOTAS
																								The only positive note of the cabinet decision to appoint a group of ministers to study reservations for the economically backward among upper castes is that a rash decision has been averted. Apart from this welcome act of prevarication, there is nothing heartening in the return of caste-based reservations to the political agenda. Admittedly, state assembly elections have become extremely competitive and neither the Congress nor the Bharatiya Janata Party are shy of bringing out a new bag of tricks with which to attract voters. However, it is a dismal commentary on the state of the nation that the hoary issue of reservations is still regarded as electorally appealing. That the upper castes, who are disproportionately important to the BJP, have long nursed a grievance at being left out of the quota race is obvious. Their predicament even merits a measure of sympathy. But appreciating a difficult predicament doesnt necessarily justify what is potentially as retrograde a measure as the initial rash of reservations for those who are deemed to be of lesser ritual standing. At a time when India looks to becoming more efficient and competitive, there is absolutely no justification for distorting the labour market. In the guise of correcting historical wrongs, India has imposed upon itself another set of historic blunders. Affirmative action, to put it bluntly, is a drag that the country can no longer afford. It is time its frontiers were rolled back and not extended through a highly dubious bipartisan consensus. 																								What is particularly galling is the fact that any extension of reservations for the upper castes is certain to bring back caste jostling into public life. It is not the BJP that is alone at fault for succumbing to populist pressures. The Congress was hardly mindful of the countrys future when it advocated the extension of caste quotas to the private sector during its Shimla conclave earlier this year. Desperate for re-election, the Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Mr Digvijay Singh, has even proposed extending reservations beyond the 50 per cent limit imposed by the Supreme Court. These are abhorrent short-cuts that defy common sense. If electoral success also depends on good governance, why are politicians unmindful of the damage caused by reservations to government efficiency? More to the point, why is the electorate so enamoured of further quotas when it knows only too well that the bloated public sector cant take any additional burden? Maybe it is all symbolic because the number of jobs on offer through caste quotas is rapidly shrinking. In which case, the GoM should explore ways of making tokenism less damaging.

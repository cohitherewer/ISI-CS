 - The Indian myth of the superiority of foreign service providers  has been exploded  COMMENTARAO / S.L. RAO The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission 
 raoslhotmail.com Only a few years ago, Indians  going abroad were armed with long shopping lists. Visitors  from overseas were particularly welcome because of the things  they could be asked to bring. These included liquor, chocolate,  soft-drink concentrates, toys, fountain and ball-point pens,  wristwatches, clothing (particularly womens underwear and  socks), and a variety of other consumer products. Even large  soft-drink bottles of plastic to store water in refrigerators,  school-bags, shirts, sweaters, suits, shoes were preferred  from abroad. Foreigners leaving India after a posting in  diplomatic missions and companies would auction everything  that they had to eager Indian social climbers for hefty  prices.  Some Indian women in Bombay and  Delhi were not even averse to buying second-hand underwear  in this way! Colleagues from overseas companies and Indian  managers returning from trips would often carry in their  suitcases essential spares and materials urgently required  in the factories but that would have been greatly delayed  if they had to wait for the necessary permissions and licenses.  Every person who had ever travelled abroad kept safely and  secretly (to avoid being caught and prosecuted as a criminal  under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act) a small nest-egg  of dollar-notes to pay for his next overseas shopping. Some multinational companies set  up special divisions to smuggle in their products (like  cigarettes) from Dubai. Some also spent on foreign advertising  channels received in India like Radio Ceylon to promote  demand in India. Distributors employed salesmen who would  make sales calls on retailers to book orders for foreign  consumer products that would be delivered within a definite  period. Others took orders from well-heeled customers for  expensive imported refrigerators, washing machines and so  on that were also delivered within a given time. Organized  selling of imported liquor, mostly whisky, was common in  all major cities, and still continues.  Most such transactions were violating  one or more of the many laws that our socialism and high  taxes had imposed on us. The government wanted to use Indian  resources for economic development. Consumption was ideologically  incorrect since it took away resources from investment in  development. Imports were banned or heavily taxed and local  production was restricted so that those who got the licenses  to import or produce could exploit the consumer with poor  quality and high prices. Generations of Indians grew up  to feel guilty about spending money on consumption. These restrictions stimulated,  in response, a labyrinth of entrepreneurs within and outside  the government. They were the fixers, colluders, smugglers,  arrangers, contact men, traders and many others from among  politicians, customs officers and other government servants,  unemployed youth, traders and others.  The ordinary citizen put multinational  companies on pedestals. He regarded them as honest, producing  the best quality products within the limitations of a closed  economy, who tried to function without offering bribes and  whose shares were better than gold because they offered  good dividends and capital appreciation with safety. Given  a choice, he would rather buy an imported branded product  than a domestically produced one, and if made in India,  by a foreign company than an Indian one.  To the large band of government  created law-breakers were added a new set when Indira Gandhi  nationalized banks and insurance companies, and set up the  countrys only mutual fund under government guarantee, the  Unit Trust of India. Vast financial resources now came under  the control of politicians, bureaucrats and other fixers.  These white-collar law-breakers could instruct banks and  financial institutions to give large loans and even purchase  equity in new and old companies. Finance ministers organized  distribution of large sums that were not meant to be recovered  through loan melas and instructed loans to be given  for non-viable projects.  UTI and the FIs were made to  buy equity in such companies. The projects were many times  unsound and with poor management. It was a happy time for  fixers and arrangers. Top management in government-owned  lending companies stopped exercising their judgment in sanctioning  financing. FIs, many banks and UTI became almost Ponzis  with book-profits not supported by inflows of interest,  dividends and loan repayments. The laws protected these  unreliable borrowers as against the lenders. In Rajiv Gandhis  words, companies became sick, but not their promoters.  Many customers of nationalized  banks continued with them only because the charges for services  were low. The service was rude, the premises were dirty  and badly lit, and the waiting time for most matters was  inordinate. As with consumer products, the foreign banks  were considered the acme of service quality. Customers would  prefer to use them but the restrictions on minimum balances  and the high charges kept customers with the state-owned  banks. In insurance also, the service  quality was atrocious. The cost of life insurance was high.  Settlement of any insurance claim was slow and often corrupt.  But the customer had no choice except Life Insurance Corporation  or General Insurance Corporation. UTI was, on the other  hand, the most trusted of the financial companies owned  by the government. It gave the government guaranteed returns.  Thus Indian consumers held in  low respect Indian manufacturers, banks, insurance companies  and financial institutions and other government-owned service  companies like Air India, Indian Airlines and the India  Tourism Development Corporation hotels. ITDC hotels lost  custom rapidly. Air India lost more slowly because Indian  ethnic traffic to the Gulf and elsewhere was more comfortable  with an Indian ambience. With Indian Airlines, passengers  could only curse its inefficiency, poor and rude service,  terrible food and poor cleanliness, but had to keep using  it.  Today the UTI has lost its glitter  because of mismanagement, causing disquiet and loss to millions  of savers, as have the financial institutions, the Industrial  Development Bank of India and the Industrial Financial Corporation  of India.  But with most of the others, the  position is transformed. Products of even the most highly  regarded multinational companies (like Lever, Procter amp;  Gamble, General Foods, Colgate, Philips) are struggling  to maintain market shares and profits. Nirma, Anchor, Rasna,  Videocon and many other Indian names are now calling the  shots in the markets. Foreign goods are legally available  at competitive prices in shops, but customers no longer  flock to them. There is little smuggling of consumer products  unless highly taxed, like cigarettes and alcoholic beverages.  No longer do Indians skimp and save on their foreign exchange  allowances to hoard a few dollars to pay for something they  might need from abroad. They can buy whatever they wish,  made in India or abroad, of the best quality, in India.  Indian Airlines is a much improved airline that is regaining  share, albeit modestly. Air India is profitable at a time  when most international airlines are losing money, despite  competition from many foreign airlines.  The nationalized banks are now  in the forefront of reform, reducing their overstaffing,  improving customer service, making their offices more attractive,  going in for computerization and installing ATMs galore.  They have done this while keeping themselves cheaper than  foreign and private banks and retaining low priced service  to the smaller depositor. Customers are beginning to prefer  them over foreign banks.  The myth of superiority of the  foreigner  whether manufacturer, bank or other service  provider  has been exploded. Even state-owned companies,  given the right environment, are showing that they can be  customer-oriented and profitable. When given freedom to  procure materials, equipment and technology from wherever  they want to, establish large and economic production capacities  in locations of their business choice, Indian manufacturers  have shown themselves to be nimbler than their elephantine  foreign competitors. The Indian consumer no longer blindly  prefers foreign to Indian. And he has begun to keep his  money in rupees, not in dollars.  If only the Indian equity markets  were cleaner, this would be a great time for Indian companies  to raise equity. That also will happen, perhaps sooner than  it has taken to demolish the myth of foreign superiority.

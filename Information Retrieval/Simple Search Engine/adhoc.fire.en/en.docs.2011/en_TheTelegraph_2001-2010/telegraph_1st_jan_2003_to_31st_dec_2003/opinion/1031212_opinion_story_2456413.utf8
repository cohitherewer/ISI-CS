		 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 EXECUTIVE IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT
 Gyan Pathak																								Article 144 of the Constitution states that all authorities, civil and judicial must act in aid of the Supreme Court. Commenting on the apex court judgment on the disinvestment of the public sector undertakings, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, the deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani, reportedly said,  It is an obstacle. But a Supreme Court judgment is not a weakness of the government. It is the law of the land and therefore you have to manoeuvre. You have to either circumvent it or find a way out. 																								It appears from this that the Centre intends to manoeuvre to push the disinvestment of the PSUs by executive order. Parliamentary supremacy is being eroded and the judiciary is sought to be circumvented. But surely the highest wisdom does not rest with the executive. Moreover, in a socialist, secular, democratic republic like India, such a mindset in the executive is an ominous sign. 																								The policy of disinvestments of PSUs is a part of the new economic policy pursued by our government since 1992. It has always been controversial. The apex court ruled that the HPCL and BPCL disinvestments required parliamentary approval and observed that the preamble of the acts under which the two companies were acquired by the government clearly stated that ownership and control would be vested in the state to ensure the end products subserved the common good.  For the people																								The Union disinvestments minister, Arun Shourie, too described the order as a major setback. Others said that the court was interfering with the executives working and that this would harm economic development.																								Whatever affects us all should be decided by all  that is the philosophy by which democracy works. Thus in a parliamentary democracy like India, all matters touching the people are, constitutionally, to be decided by Parliament. No agency  the executive, legislature or judiciary  is above this principle. The critics of the apex court judgment who want to manoeuvre and circumvent have forgotten this. 																								Our Constitution upholds a socialistic philosophy and the endeavour for economic justice. And it is only possible to ensure economic justice by following certain due processes. The court did not stop disinvestments, it only put a brake on the illegal disinvestments that the executive was trying to push forward when it had no power to do so. 																								Oil is a strategic sector and any decision pertaining to it affects us all Indians. Why should a handful of ministers have the power to decide on such a sensitive sector? This is why the law provides for any decision on the matter to be made by Parliament. By trying to bypass Parliament, the executive violated the Constitution. Only a few months ago, the opposition parties had unanimously demanded that the Centre get Parliaments approval before privatizing HPCL and BPCL. The apex court was only restoring the primacy of Parliament. Social justice																								Earlier too there have been cases where the executive enacted ordinances to try to push through policies which failed to get Parliaments nod. Take the cabinet committee on disinvestments decision to sell off Indian Oil Corporation Limited after splitting it. This too is against the spirit of the Supreme Court decree because the executive does not own the company, it is the people who do and it their representatives sitting in Parliament who can decide.																								Socialism is enshrined in the Preamble and every economic decision should be based on this pattern  anything else is tantamount to flouting the basic tenets of the Constitution. Thus no policy can favour only the rich. But in the past decade of the new economic policy, the rich have become richer and the poor, poorer. The policy is pro-rich, which is against the socialistic principle of the Constitution. Thus the judiciarys stepping in to stop the illegal disinvestment of the oil majors, is not an infringment on the rights of the executive.

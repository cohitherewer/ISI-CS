		 Monday, September 15, 2003  OUT OF THE BOX
 Set-top boxes will help everyone but  the viewer of cable television, writes Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting Losers all the way  A whole lot of nonsense there  has been over the introduction of this system called CAS   the conditional access system. All the laboured explanations  by the minister and his officials have quite befuddled many  of us. Has the good minister stopped to consider just why  he has got himself into this mess? Goodness knows theres  a great deal to be done about improving matters in the field  of broadcasting without his tying himself up in knots over  something he shouldnt have given a second thought. For some years I was involved  in work which took me to New York a number of times a year.  I stayed in a hotel where each room had a television set  with a set-top box. Yes, an honest to goodness set-top box.  It sat snugly on top of the television set and by selecting  a number on its screen you could access a channel. It had  an additional facility  there were some channels that showed  what they called adult films, and if you selected any of  those with your remote, an additional charge was automatically  added to your bill. These are not revolutionary new gadgets;  theyve been around for years now. It isnt essential if  you want to watch all the channels that New York has; for  that you have the remote control. But it is essential for  what the hotel wanted  to charge you for the naughty films  you saw. That is, it helped the hotel, not you. Now were being told that the  set-top boxes that will be necessary when CAS comes into  being will help us select the channels we want to see. But  were doing that anyway, with our remote. But then, like  the hotel in New York, the set-top box isnt really meant  to help you, its meant to help somebody else  the commercial  broadcasters who have pay channels. Just as the hotel used  the box to charge a guest who saw a naughty film, the CAS  box will enable the broadcaster to determine how many viewers  are watching his channel and charge the cable operator accordingly.  So is all that was said about  it being a great benefit for viewers, who would now be able  to see the channels that they want to see a load of rubbish?  Im afraid it is. Just consider the situation on the ground  today. Those of us who have cable connections get a bill  from our friendly neighbourhood cable operator, with an  amount, which we duly pay. I have yet to see a bill that  gives in detail the channels being provided and the charges  for those among them that are pay channels with the rate  per channel mentioned. It simply doesnt happen that way.  All of us get a whole lot of channels we dont ever watch.  And well continue to do so after the introduction of CAS,  whenever that is  if it ever is.  What we do is use our remote control  switches to watch the channels we do want to see. So, if  we get bills that are a sort of general charge for our cable  connection, and we can select from out of the channels we  get the ones we want by using the remote, and the cable  operator decides which these will be, as he does today,  what, for goodness sake, is the set-top box going to do  to improve this situation, assuming it does need improvement? The answer is exactly what youve  thought it is; nothing. As far as I can make out, trying  to peer through the farrago of statements on this wretched  business, the only ones who may benefit from this are the  cable and satellite broadcasters who operate pay channels.  Theres been a continuing, sometimes acrimonious, argument  between them and the big cable operators, the multi-system  operators, about how many viewers watch different pay channels.  The MSOs are supposed to pay the broadcasters a certain  fee for each viewer who watches each pay channel. The MSOs  report figures that the broadcasters have always maintained  are much lower than the actual number. The CAS system will  supposedly provide exact figures of who watches what  which  is what the broadcasters want; and the MSOs cant object,  or theyll be loudly accused of admitting to the allegation  that they under-report viewership figures. Some years ago the audience research  organizations introduced what was called the people meter.  This was a device that recorded exactly who saw what programme  on what channel, and selected homes were persuaded to have  a set-top box put in for this purpose. They were persuaded  earnestly that it wouldnt harm their television sets, wouldnt  distort the signal, and the data would be collected in a  manner that didnt inconvenience the family. The system  is now in place in a number of cities and is the basis of  the viewership figures provided to broadcasters.  But these people meters have been  installed only in a selected number of homes; how can one  determine the total number of people watching a pay channel  exactly, on a basis with which no one can argue? Obviously  if viewers had set-top boxes, from which data could be collected.  And to round off the ploy with a measure of cleverness,  the viewer, poor soul, was to pay for the set-top box. And  to make him swallow this, the import duties on boxes was  drastically reduced, broadcasters and MSOs offered boxes  at temptingly low rates and all the while the viewer was  bombarded by all kinds of statements on the benefits or  ill effects of the system. And, far from staying away from  such a blatantly commercial deal, the government gaily jumped  into it. Why did they do it? This is, sadly, what happens  when powerful commercial interests and the government cosy  up to each other. The mutual back-scratching is not only  pleasurable, but profitable in other ways.  No one is saying that watching  television shouldnt be made easier and the selection of  channels given over to the viewer. But the matter could  have been thought through a little more carefully, and the  wisdom of the technical experts sought. One could then have  seen not only what the alternatives are, but how practical  and how best implemented too. Now all one can do is wait  and watch this grotesque act being played out, for entertainment,  if for nothing else. That, after all, is the aim of commercial  television.

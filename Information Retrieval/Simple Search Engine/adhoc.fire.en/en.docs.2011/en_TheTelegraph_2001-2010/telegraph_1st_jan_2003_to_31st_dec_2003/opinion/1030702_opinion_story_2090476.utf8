 - Can Sonia Gandhi head and manage an alliance not led by  the BJP?  PRATAP BHANU MEHTA The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University A big question hovering over Indian  politics is this: if there is to be a government not led  by the Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre after the next  general election, who will head it? Who are the non-BJP  contenders for the prime ministers office? This question  cannot entirely be answered in advance. Much will depend  on the exact distribution of seats. Does the Congress get  somewhere in the range of 175 or does it cross the 200 seat  mark? How many seats does the Samajwadi Party manage to  muster in Uttar Pradesh? How does the Nationalist Congress  Party do in Maharashtra? How does the Congress fare in Karnataka?  These imponderables will have a significant effect on the  negotiations and horse-trading which will go into the making  of a non-BJP alliance and the subsequent formation of a  government. Barring any unexpected events, the next election  will probably be more about the nuances of local mathematics  than any clear mandates.  For the time being, Mulayam Singh  Yadav seems to be making his peace with Sonia Gandhi. The  Samajwadi Party is desperate for allies. Although it is  a substantial force in UP, much of its ability to sustain  itself as a party will depend on getting access to power  sometime soon, either at the Centre or the state. Desperation  is throwing the party into the arms of the Congress, but  make no mistake, this is still a very reluctant embrace.  The realization is also dawning upon the Congress that it  cannot entirely go it alone. Even on a very optimistic projection,  where the Congress retains its current strongholds  Rajasthan,  Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka  as it is likely to do, and  makes substantial gains in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and  Gujarat, its near-absence from UP and Bihar makes it very  likely that it will need allies.  Since it is in a direct contest  with regional parties in the south, these allies will have  to come from UP and Bihar. Another alternative might be  to rope in a party like Sharad Pawars NCP, which still  has the potential of acting spoiler for the Congress. The  question is: can Sonia Gandhi head and manage an alliance?  There are two ways of playing  the Sonia question within the Congress. On the one hand,  it could be argued that her leadership has cost Congress  dear. She is, to some extent a political liability. She  does not have any manifest political charisma or leadership  skills; she has managed to drive out significant would-be  Congressites like the NCP and the Tamil Manila Congress;  she is still surrounded by the politically and intellectually  mediocre end of the Congress, and is largely counting on  the Congresss historical presence and on some of her chief  ministers to pull the Congress through.  On the other hand, many in the  Congress think that the party will be finished without the  dynasty. The reason is not simple subservience. A good deal  of it has to do with two features of the Congress. First,  regional leaders always cancel one another out. It is notorious  that historically, within the Congress, one regional strongman  will go to any lengths to prevent another significant regional  player from taking the top position. In their stalemate,  they are more likely to support someone who appears neutral  and open to manipulation.  This was the logic that led to  the installation of Indira Gandhi, but she soon outwitted  the conglomeration of regional bosses who put her there,  cutting them down to size. The same logic prevailed in the  choice of Narasimha Rao, who although an astute politician  was an electoral non-entity compared to Sharad Pawar or  Rajesh Pilot. Second, the Congress has no institutionalized  way of electing leaders, no rules of election upon which  most of its members agree. Such a system allows dynastic  patronage politics to flourish. The dynasty becomes the  easy answer to a stalemate between other leaders.  Much the same logic would apply  to a broader alliance. Remember why Morarji Desai or a Chandrashekhar  and later, I.K. Gujral were acceptable prime ministers?  They did not belong to any region, in the political sense  of the term, and had no faction of their own. Their political  insignificance was their asset. First of all, if Sharad  Pawar and those disgruntled with Sonia become significant  players in the horse-trading, it is likely that Sonia Gandhi  will be unacceptable. On the other hand Mulayam and Laloo  Prasad Yadav will extract a significant price for their  support. The question is: will this price be limited to  complete domination over their respective states, or will  they, as in the past, extract a significant price at the  Centre as well? If the latter scenario prevails, the chances  of discontent within the Congress are not inconsiderable.  Can Sonia Gandhi carry out this balancing act?  At the present conjuncture, alliances  are moving in a direction which suggests that she can. This  is simply because, both the Congress and its potential allies  are desperate. In many ways, this is a critical election  for both the Congress and the Samajwadi Party. If they do  not make it to power this time their very survival is at  stake. On the other hand, desperation is not necessarily  enduring cement. Suppose, for a moment, that there is a  Congress-led alliance at the Centre with the Samajwadi Party  and the Rashtriya Janata Dal in tow.  Are Mulayam and Laloo potentially  more unstable allies for the Congress than the Telegu Desam  Party, Samata and BSP are for the BJP? Will they make the  rest of the Congress more anxious than the BJPs allies  make it nervous? On the evidence of past behaviour, the  answer is probably yes. For one thing, the Samajwadi Party  will demand more promiscuous central intervention in the  politics of UP than TDP asks the BJP to intervene in Andhra  Pradesh. This creates more potential lines of conflict.  Second, in the south, regional  leaders are secure in their bases independently of the Centre.  In the north, the temptation is to acquire greater Central  power to shore up your position in the states. Mulayam was  greatly helped, first, by V.P. Singhs Mandalization of  politics, then by his stint at the Centre. This again suggests  that the chances of a northern alliance partner overreaching  are greater than if your ally is from the south. The pressures  on a Congress-led alliance will be immense. It will call  forth the skills of the leader who is more adept at complicated  circumnavigation than Sonia Gandhi; her distinct contribution  to politics is an ability to hide behind a small coterie.  In short, notwithstanding the  growing warmth between Mulayam and Sonia, it is still too  early to see how the leadership conundrum of a non-BJP-led  government will be resolved. If history is any guide, non-BJP  alliance politics usually favours non-descript and weak  leaders. Sonia Gandhis advantage is that she is weak; her  disadvantage is that she is not non-descript and gives many  political parties reasons to veto her.  Although it is foolish to make  predictions, here are two on offer, for all they are worth.  Barring any unexpected incidents like Godhra, terrorism  or communal violence, we will throw up a hung parliament  with non-BJP parties in a position to form the government.  There will be leadership squabbles, but the allure of power  will compel the Congress to form alliances with a bunch  of parties. But, if the Congresss tally is near or under  200, do not be surprised if the leader of such an alliance  turns out to be a dark horse, or more appropriately, a horse  we had long assumed dead, like Chandrashekhar or someone  similar, a result of different strongmen cancelling one  another out. Barring an unexpected Congress wave, the odds  are still slightly against Sonia Gandhi. In either case,  the leader will have an impossible task managing an alliance   and heaven forbid that we require a mid-term election.

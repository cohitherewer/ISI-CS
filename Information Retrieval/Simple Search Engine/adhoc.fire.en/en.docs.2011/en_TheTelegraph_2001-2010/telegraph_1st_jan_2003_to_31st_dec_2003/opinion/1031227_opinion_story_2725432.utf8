 Jingle all the way Time was when we borrowed the  Yuletide spirit from the Brits, now they seem to be doing  it our way. Popular UK-based comedian Sanjeev-The-Kumars-at-No.  42 Bhaskar has been chosen by Cadburys Celebrations chocolates  as the face to represent the spirit of the season in their  Christmas special ad. The Goodness Gracious Me star is seen  here going home with a box of chocolates for his parents  (the real proud ones, not the running-him-down Kumars),  and generally making their day. So how long before the Asian  takeover is complete? As the fanatic might say, it all started  with seasonings 300 years ago, now even their seasons belong  to us. Beri original Theres only so much nonsense  you can take from models just so theyd wear your clothes.  Last heard, Ritu Beri had taken to dressing up trees. The  fashion designer spent the last week in Paris, at a designer  convention to showcase Christmas trees with a difference.  The high priestess of fashion had decorated her offering  in wrought iron with ornaments used in Hindu rituals  diyas,  Om-signs, the works. The Karmic Tree comes with a fancy  philosophy attached. As we near the year-end, the tree  signifies the karmas of this year that we carry forward  to the next, explains Beri. Proceeds from the auction of  the trees will go towards building a gym for orphans. Looks  like Beri has got her karma in order. The Hindu Christmas  mix-up notwithstanding, that is. Space jammin  Never mind the one between their  ears, rock band Deep Purple has always had a penchant for  space (remember Space Truckin?). And had found a fan in  Kalpana Chawla. The band has now returned the affection  with a commemorative song called Contact Lost in their latest  album, Bananas. Indeed, they rock!

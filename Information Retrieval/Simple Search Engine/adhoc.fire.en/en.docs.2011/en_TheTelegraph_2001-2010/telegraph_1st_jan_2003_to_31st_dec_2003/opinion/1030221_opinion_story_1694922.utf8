I am alone and find my way  desirable daughters (Rupa, Rs 195) by Bharati Mukherjee is a novel intriguingly dedicated to Clark-babu. Its epigraph  a piece of Sanskrit verse adapted by Octavio Paz and translated by Eliot Weinberger  provides a beautiful point of entry into its mongrel universe: No one behind, no one ahead./ The path the ancients cleared has closed.

Rays Feluda stories do not work in English for this reason. This book too sounds bland, and the bits of folk-poetry at the end sound stilted and unharmonized with the surrounding talk. Moreover, there are printing errors. If the point of these translations isto woo non-Bengali readers into reading Bengali fiction, then Rupa will have to do a better job. There are more readable thrillers in the English language  slicker, more tightly plotted and more racily written. And Kakababu-veterans  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 21, 2003  Letters to Editor In total devotion Sir  The power sants and  sadhus wield in India should not be unknown. The  report, Sadhus cold to Ash charm (June 19), show how complete  their control is over the political fraternity. Worse, leaders  seem to be only too willing to bend over backwards to please  them. Take Digvijay Singh, who has relinquished the idea  of allowing Aishwarya Rai to popularize Simhastha, a religious  festival in Ujjain next year. But Rai has already proved  her ability to draw masses. And Singhs idea could have  promoted tourism and helped the local economy. It is sad  the chief minister has yielded to the whims of the sadhus.  Yours faithfully, Poulami Basu, Calcutta
				 																Judgment on a judge				 																																																				Sir  The report, Judge in call-girl supplier dock (June 17), is another instance of the corruption rampant among senior officials of the judiciary. The Indian judiciary is already on the verge of collapse under the weight of the innumerable pending cases that have swelled the number of undertrial prisoners and added to the misery of countless people. How will the criminal justice system be helped by the revelation of a few scandals involving judges?				 																																																				It is time to elevate the judiciary from the mire of petty politics. Justice dispensation has to be speeded up. In an environment vitiated by politics sans morality and the workings of a parliament without discipline, the judiciary remains our only resort to gain some redress. It is important to make the judiciary stronger and ensure its accountability to the people.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir Judge in call-girl supplier dock was shocking. One wonders how such people who have performed a role as significant as that of a judge can become kingpins in the flesh trade. Perhaps, after retirement, Rajesh Mishra had no opportunity to receive bribes. The urge to make a quick buck must have proved too overwhelming for the retired judge. What if retired policemen also turned criminals after retirement?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Aparajita Dasgupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The arrest of the suspended civil judge by the Uttar Pradesh police for running a call-girl racket once again proves that our learned judges do not want to be left behind in the rat race. Rajesh Mishra is not the only example of the corruption in the judiciary. The Mysore sex scandal involving three Karnataka high court judges was a similar instance of malpractice among judicial officers. It is ironical that those who passed or still pass judgments on the acts of others are themselves involved in similar or worse crimes. If judges continue to indulge in such practices, people will soon lose faith in the judiciary.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Dipankar Bera, Howrah

				 																African tips				 																																																				Sir  Flies buzz out of 13-year-old boys body in rare disease(June 14) would be regarded as common occurrence in Africa. While serving in west Africa as a medical practitioner, I witnessed similar cases. Tumbu flies (Cordylobia anthropophaga) often lay eggs on linen spread out on the ground for drying. The eggs hatch in contact with the human body, and the larvae enters the skin and form a small boil like swelling. After the flies have matured they fly out through skin openings. Something similar is happening in the case of Chandan Goswami. 				 																																																				The treatment is rather simple in Africa. The affected area is covered with a thick antiseptic cream so that the larvae dies of suffocation. Surprisingly enough, I found this disease common among the fair-skinned foreigners. I did not witness this case among the native population.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ranjit Das, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  Chandan Goswamis case is very common in east African countries like Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. My wife faced a similar problem in Kenya and was cured in no time at all. Doctors treating Goswami perhaps need to follow the African technique of treating the case.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

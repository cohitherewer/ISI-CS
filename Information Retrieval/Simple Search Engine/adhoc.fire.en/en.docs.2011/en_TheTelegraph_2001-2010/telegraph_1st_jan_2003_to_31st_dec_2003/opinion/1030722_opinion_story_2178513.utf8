 Timothy Carney argues that  as long as the coalition remembers that Iraq belongs to Iraqis,  there is no danger of the country becoming a second Vietnam The author worked as senior advisor  to the Iraqi ministry of industry and minerals from mid-March  to mid-June 2003. He retired in 2000 after 32 years in the  US Foreign Service, having served as ambassador to Sudan,  Haiti and on three UN missions. He is now a consultant Who's that in the picture? During a meeting in early June  between a senior American official in Baghdad and some 150  Sheikhs representing different Iraqi tribal groups, one  leader rose and asked the question on everyones mind. He  wondered whether the coalition was a liberation force  as President George W. Bush proclaimed or rather an occupation  force. My then-colleague hemmed and hawed, finally conceding  the presence was an occupation. Uproar followed. A senior  Iraqi civil servant told me later, with considerable understatement,  that this was not a very clever reply. The answer fanned the Sheikhs  worst fears about coalition intentions and sparked a nationalist  response questioning the legitimacy of what is, in international  law, an occupation. The key issue in Iraq today is this:  how long can this massive foreign presence, whatever its  intentions, continue and persuade enough Iraqis to transform  this ancient land into a 21st century pole of modern economic  and political attraction for west Asia? Can the coalition  convince Iraqis that it is in their interest to work together  to achieve this important goal? So far, we have not done a good  job of addressing most Iraqis concerns. The coalition has  been clumsy and played into the hands of its opponents who  include die-hard Saddam Hussein loyalists as well as Islamists  with their own agendas. The recent appointment of a governing  council is an important step in recognizing the need for  partnership with Iraqis. However, to be successful, the  council must overcome deep-seated Iraqi concerns by both  having real power and being seen to have real power. The powerful anti-coalition feelings  are rooted in Muslim rage at what they perceive to be uncritical  American support for Israel. This anger has translated into  suspicion of American intentions towards the Muslim world  and fear that the United States of America seeks to undermine  Islam through a combination of direct military action, cultural  imperialism and Christian proselytizing. As a result, some  Shiite Muslim leaders demanded the departure of US troops  as soon as the regime had been overthrown. The extent to which this Islamic  dynamic plays into the strategy of Hussein loyalists is  unclear, but worrisome. Do Shiite Muslims tolerate Saddam  Husseins continuing successful evasion because they oppose  the presence of foreign troops? Do they believe that if  the coalition forces were to leave, Iraqis could achieve  what they failed to for more than 35 years and put an end  to Saddam Hussein? The armed anti-coalition opposition  itself has clearly taken heart from Saddam Husseins escape.  By early July, a broad, though fairly small-scale, armed  opposition to the coalition led some pundits to wonder if  a coherent resistance was coalescing. Military analysts,  hearing reports of the clandestine organization called The  Return (of Saddam Hussein) are suggesting that the movement  has increasing command and control capabilities. The US  central command and senior defence department officials  continue to caution against leaping to such conclusions,  but the longer Hussein remains at large, the greater the  possibility that his supporters could inspire a controlled  and disciplined resistance. Saddam Husseins death or capture  would eliminate much of this potential. Some suggest that the coalition  will soon find itself in a Vietnam-style guerrilla war.  In late March, the British journalist and author, William  Shawcross (Evening Standard, March 25) anticipated  these fears. He argued, however, that two vital elements  of the Vietnam situation are absent in Iraq. First, Iraqs  opposition cannot count on external support. Iraq has neither  a reliable rear area such as the one that Beijing provided  for Hanoi, nor a major financial backer like the Soviet  Union. Second, Shawcross argued that Iraq lacks a nationalist  and sufficiently popular indigenous authority that would  oppose coalition forces. He noted that Saddam Hussein ruled  by fear and people may still be intimidated by the Hussein  loyalists. However, not all Iraqis see the  coalition as saviours. Recent history drives Shiite doubts  about American staying power. These doubts exacerbated by  the inevitable cultural insensitivity and tactical clumsiness  of a foreign occupying force could coalesce into passive  resistance at a minimum and active armed struggle as the  worst case scenario. Armed opposition might initially benefit  from widespread frustration with a coalition that has not  delivered security and basic services such as water, electricity,  communications and waste disposal. If average Iraqis also  feel alienated from the political and economic process,  they might ally themselves with any group promising to drive  out the occupiers. To forestall such a resistance,  the coalition must implement a three-pronged strategy in  partnership with a broad spectrum of Iraqis. First, coalition  forces must enforce security but must refrain from overreacting  to military provocations. Overreaction could unite what  is a politically fragmented Shiite Muslim community to the  detriment of the goal of creating a secular 21st century  Iraq. A secular Iraq can use its diversity and plurality  to advance towards broad prosperity and thus serve as a  model in the region.  To establish security without  alienating important elements, the coalition must internationalize  non-military operations. Iraq needs more local police trained  to maintain civil order and investigate civilian crimes.  The coalition must accelerate the formation of an Iraqi  police force and an Iraqi army. These organizations require  equipment and advisors. The bomb attack that killed seven  at a police graduation ceremony in early July suggests that  Hussein loyalists recognize the threat posed by an independent  Iraqi police force and army. Second, the coalition must quickly  place authority into Iraqi hands. The creation of the governing  council is a positive step in this direction. However, it  is vital that this council visibly bear an important share  of responsibility for developing Iraqs economic and political  policies. Thus, the council must have not only a major role  in budgetary planning, but also specific control over resources  essential to rebuilding. Only such action can counter arguments  that the coalition is a mere occupation force. Third, the coalitions relatively  anaemic media effort needs to be expanded and enhanced.  As initially conceived, the coalitions Iraqi Media Network  had too narrow a vision. Daring talk of transforming Comical  Alis information ministry into a national public broadcasting  service along the lines of the US National Public Radio  or the BBC must be realized. L. Paul Bremers vision of  a prosperous, modern Iraq with a representative political  structure needs a broad audience across the nation, on radio,  on television and in print. These three elements require coalition  personnel able to work cooperatively with Iraqis. The international  press is full of reports illustrating who can work in Iraq  and who cannot. The American officer who backed his troops  away from a major Shiite shrine and ordered them onto one  knee with their rifle muzzles on the ground to calm angry  crowds deserves the same medal as the British officer who  instructed his men, on entering Iraq, that no coalition  flags would be planted. Against these fine examples are  stories of coalition soldiers who are barely civil to Iraq  police trainees and who clearly fear any interaction with  the populace. The coalition and its public servants must  never forget that Iraq belongs to Iraqis and that its citizens  deserve our respect.

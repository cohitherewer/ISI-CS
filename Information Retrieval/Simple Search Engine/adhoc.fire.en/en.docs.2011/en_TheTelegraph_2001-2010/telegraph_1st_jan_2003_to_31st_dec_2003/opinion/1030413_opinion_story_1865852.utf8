The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, April 13, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Adding fuel to felony				 																																																				Sir  It takes a great deal of audacity to auction stolen goods  for charity or otherwise (Winona vexes judge with steal-and-sell charity cry, April 9). To make matters worse, Winona Ryders lawyer claims that the judiciary is throwing away an opportunity to tide over its funds crunch. Ryders theft and the revelation that she bought prescription drugs using six different names indicate that she has a problem. Just because she has completed a part of her probabtion ahead of schedule does not mean she is back to being a good girl.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Snigdha Sarkar, Calcutta

				 																Law of the wild				 																																																				Sir  The two lawyers who, instead of apologizing for violating traffic rules, proceeded to assault the policeman on duty, ought to be penalized in an exemplary manner (Lawyers break law, April 5). The accounts of the eyewitnesses make it clear that the fault lies squarely with the the lawyers, Debashis Karmakar and Abhijit Banerjee, and not with Gaurib Bose, the policeman manning the road near the GPO. It is extremely unfortunate that the lawyers association in the state has chosen not to view the issue from an objective perspective, making the group of lawyers appear to have been victimized. But people used to lax policing and a culture of bribing are likely to find the transition to a stricter regime hard to adjust to. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
C.R.Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The makers and upholders of law in this part of the world are often picked up from the wrong side of the law, like Debashis Karmakar and Abhijit Banerjee. This is perhaps because as framers or interpreters of the laws, they know the loopholes best. Can we blame the average citizen to following the path that the rich and the powerful have shown? Hopefully, with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees recent directives against jaywalking, the lawyers will be brought to book and not allowed to get away scot-free. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is all very well that Gaurib Bose put the lawyers who disregarded traffic rules in their place. But would he have had the guts to accord the same treatment to a minister or a politician?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Srinjoy Roy, Calcutta

				 																Useless fad				 																																																				Sir  At time, it is difficult to determine whether The Telegraph wants to adopt a rational and scientific approach or throw these to the wind. At the same time that it strongly attacks, in the editorial and news pages, the Bharatiya Janata Partys attempt at promoting astrology as a science, and to include it in the university curriculum, valuable space in Good Life is wasted every week on Feng Shui, which is neither scientific, nor rational. 				 																																																				Thankfully, the article, Feng Shui fraud (April 10), has exposed the practice, making it possible for all scientific-minded people to breathe easier again. Isnt it time now to stop publishing the weekly column on Feng Shui?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arunava Choudhury, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The article on Feng Shui fraud was a welcome break from the television programmes and newspaper columns promoting the ancient Chinese art of house-building and interior decoration. 				 																																																				Feng Shui has become a fad these days, with boutiques selling fancy Feng Shui cures. Authentic Feng Shui cures are usually represented by the five elements, and do not cost much. One might actually already have them in ones house  things such as metal pendulum, clock, plants, aquariums, pictures and so on. These objects just need to be placed in the proper location depending upon the orientation, proportion and energy pattern of the house. Again, by choosing specific colours for the walls or curtains, elemental energies can be enhanced and manipulated to suit the residents. Instead of explaining these simple cures to the public, the so-called Feng Shui experts dupe people into buying expensive yet useless objects.

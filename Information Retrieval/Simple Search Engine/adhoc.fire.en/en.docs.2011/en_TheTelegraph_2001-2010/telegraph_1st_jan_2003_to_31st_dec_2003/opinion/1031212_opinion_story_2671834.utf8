The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, December 12, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																The Victorians are still with usRegional Human Development Report: HIV/AIDS and Development in South Asia 2003 (UNDP, Rs 395) is an important and challenging document, which examines the complex interplay between disease and deprivation in specific regions of south Asia. HIV and human development are linked in a mutually reinforcing manner  HIV can undo the gains of human devlopment, and the lack of human development can trump any strategy against HIV. Two key areas which the report focuses on are stigma and discrimination, and the vulnerability of women. The reports picture of India is frightening: prevalence estimated at 3.97 million, ranking second only to South Africa. Epidemic slowly moving beyond its initial concentration among sex-workers. Sub-epidemics are emerging with potentially explosive spread among groups of injecting drug-users and men who have sex with men. 																												Seabiscuit: The True Story Of Three Men And A Racehorse (Fourth Estate,  3.99) by Laura Hillenbrand is an award-winning sports book about the eponymous racehorse, undersized and crooked-legged, which received, in 1938, more press coverage than Hitler, Mussolini or Roosevelt. This is the story  picked up by Hollywood, of course  of how Seabiscuits trainer, owner and jockey turned him into an international icon in the latter half of the Depression. A sentimental, but well-told story of winning against the odds. The scarlet dusk (Rupa,  Rs 195) by Saradindu Bandopadhyay is a collection  of five stories, rather badly translated from the original  Bengali by Malobika Chaudhuri. It is quite wrong to translate  Raktasandhya as The Scarlet Dusk, and each one of the  opening sentences from the first story has a grammatical  error or infelicity: Sometimes, in a simple humdrum monotonous  life, certain events take place like an earthquake, which  when compared to the environment seems like an impossible  disaster. The story which I am about to narrate today too  appeared in my life unexpectedly, all of a sudden. Datta (Rupa, Rs 195)  by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay is another inadequate  translation of a witty romance with a serious theme: the  problematic attachment between an affluent Brahmo woman  and brilliant young Hindu man. Sukhendu Rays English translation  is under-punctuated, and the prose often feels wrong to  the ear, although the grammar and syntax are technically  alright. There is more about the translator than about Saratchandra  on the back-cover.The victorians (Arrow,   5.80) by A.N. Wilson is a solid and delightful  book, full of unusual pictures, written by an Englishman  who has also written about Scott, Tolstoy, C.S. Lewis, Iris  Murdoch, St Paul and Jesus. Wilson  like Lytton Strachey  before him  is particularly acute and entertaining about  the various individuals who give Victorias reign its varied  and idiosyncratic character. The Victorians, Wilson claims,  are still with us. His survey is broadly chronological   Mill, Ruskin, Carroll, Gladstone, Gilbert and Sullivan,  Parnell, Kipling  and ends with the Boer War. The Victorian  Age, haunted by the dire warnings of Malthus, had begun  with the erection of workhouses on home territory. It ended  with a war which was no more than a scramble for gold and  diamonds...A people who built workhouses at the beginning  of an era and concentration camps at the end might have  gained the whole world, but they had lost honour, and soul.  Here is the queen with her trusted Munshi, Abdul Karim,  described by Wilson as a mildly fraudulent character.

		 Friday, August 15, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																With ruinous resultsCon Brio (Vintage,   3.95) by Brina Svit is the Slovenian writers  third novel. Peter Constantines translations conveys the  dry and relentless unfolding of a tortured story, as the  narrator finds his ordered life being gradually dislocated  by a sexual obsession. Tibors tale has an almost impossible  beginning, an impulsive proposal in a restaurant, but Svits  mastery lies in making the painfully possible emerge slowly  and convincingly out of the relationship that follows. The history of Tom Jones, a  foundling (Rupa, Rs 195) by Henry Fielding  needs to be repeatedly issued, for it remains unchallenged  as a comic classic in English literature. This edition carries  an introduction by Alan Pryce-Jones, and a sketch of Henry  Fieldings life and career  equipment helpful for the first-time  reader.  Hanklyn-Janklyn (Tara,  $ 15.95) by Nigel Hankin is not just good fun,  it is also a good companion on the shelf for the irreplaceable  Hobson-Jobson. The Anglo-Indian world of words has  grown. And now, Hinglish words comprise a substantial percentage  of the strange-sounding creatures that have managed to insinuate  themselves into the global English vocabulary. Hankin has  a lot to play with, and he goes about the game with the  eccentricity worthy of the pioneering explorer. Some confusions  notwithstanding  like that of the sari with the  dhoti  the book is useful for Indophiles, although  the production could have done with a lot of improvement. The peoples music (Pimlico,   5.80) by Ian MacDonald is the music journalists  second triumph after Revolution in the Head. It is  a collection of essays, each of which studies the different  personalities and aspects of British pop music of the Sixties  and the Seventies. The essays include an assessment of Bob  Dylan, and discussions on John Lennon, the Rolling Stones,  Pink Floyd, David Bowie and Nick Drake. What is most valuable  about the book is its depiction of the times, without which  the reading of the music would have been left without a  context. 																												Dinner for two (Pimlico,  6.99) by Mike Gayle is an enjoyable romantic comedy, the kind that keeps you hoping that things will soon be hunky-dory even if the love of your life has turned away. The journalistic world it presents is bristling with modern issues and predicaments, but the tale is refreshingly free of modern palmtop philosophizing.

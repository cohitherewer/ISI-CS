The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, May 05, 2003  PRESENTED AND PASSED OVER
 - The Indian economy is once again hostage to politics  COMMENTARAO / S.L. RAO The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. raoslhotmail.com The budget has been presented,  commented upon, slightly revised, and will as usual be ignored  by Parliament for more exciting events, and passed with  some minor amendments and fine-tuning to meet the assumed  election requirements. Everyone is now focussed after the  invasion of Iraq and the late confused Indian resolution  on the most recent initiative on Pakistan.  Meanwhile, consumer prices of  petrol and diesel have been reduced, though slowly and by  less than the rate at which they were raised. The oil companies  say it is because they have yet to benefit from the sharp  drop in international prices, though this consideration  did not affect the fairly prompt response to the increase  in international prices. The surface transport minister,  presumably with the consent of the petroleum minister, had  promised truck strikers that diesel prices would be reduced  soon. Absence of an objective, independent and consultative  determination of tariffs helps this opaque decision-making. Privatization of Air India and  Indian Airlines has been abandoned. The bonanza from the  imminent purchase of new planes may be behind this decision.  Substantial investments in new metropolitan airports, along  with the investment in roads, should stimulate cement, aluminum,  steel and other basic industries and the economy. The petroleum minister fought  vociferously against the privatization of Hindustan Petroleum  and Bharat Petroleum, building coalitions within the cabinet.  He may yet get his way with support from some National Democratic  Alliance constituents, the opposition, and with the SARS  epidemic leading to fears of reduced number of prospective  buyers. No doubt this will become a repeat of the airlines  privatization story that also saw similar tactics of yes  and no over the years.  Meanwhile he is yet to decide  on the principles for pricing oil products. The Oil and  Natural Gas Corporation and the Gas Authority of India Limited  want parity with international market prices. GAIL wants  a national pipeline monopoly. The oil regulator is still  in the pipeline, though its emasculated emergence may not  make a difference to the sector besides providing yet more  job opportunities for retiring government servants. So fuel  prices (coal, oil and gas) continue to be set by government  and the public sector companies.  Like clockwork, coal and oil products  prices have regularly been raised. Oil companies make good  profits though their administered and cross-subsidized prices  hide their real efficiencies. Coal continues to be a highly  protected public sector commodity, though the protection  is not so much against foreign competition as against the  interests of the user industries (electricity and fertilizers)  and their consumers. Fuel prices have been an important  reason for the rising power generation costs, and consequent  rise in electricity tariffs, yet inadequate to cover the  fuel price increases. Costs of fertilizer subsidies for  government have also risen with rising gas prices. Additions  to electricity transmission capacity moving power from the  East to the South and North have improved its availability.  The availability-based tariff ordered by the Central Electricity  Regulatory Commission three years ago was fought by the  public sector up to the Supreme Court. Now implemented,  it has begun to improve electricity quality as well as bring  demand and supply into better balance.  But electricity reform makes poor  overall progress. Losses continue to pile up and the one-time  securitization that has cleaned the state electricity board  balance sheets may have done so only temporarily. There  is little private interest for investment in generation  or distribution. The Iraq invasion has aggravated  the rising inflationary pressures in the economy. It had  started with rising fuel and electricity prices. Food prices  have been rising because of poor monsoons for two years.  The poor monsoons now forecasted will worsen inflation.  The truckers strike pushed the index to its highest levels  of the last two years. It should fall now that the strike  has been withdrawn. However, given the proclivity of traders  to bring prices down more slowly than raising them, and  the poor monsoon forecast, much of the increase will stay.  Inflation seems to have come back. Strangely, despite inflation and  negative real interest rates, the Reserve Bank of India  has reduced the bank rate and increased liquidity. The saver  is left with few choices to safeguard his old age. Relatively  safe investment opportunities are limited to the post office,  RBI bonds, and a few mutual funds with after tax returns  of around 6.5 per cent. Bank deposits are not attractive.  The finance minister would like  the saver to go to equity but has yet not done enough to  assure safety. Despite sops by removing tax on distributed  dividends, and a one-year holiday from capital gains, equity  investments continue to look risky, with declining values  for most shares.Low interest rates could compel higher savings  and less expenditure, holding up economic revival. Middle-income  earners might have to increase savings for paying for earlier  purchases on high interest hire purchase. But reduced interest  rates have helped corporate results. Consumer goods manufacturers are  having a hard time, with vicious competition, erosion in  margins, heavy marketing expenditures especially on promotions,  and in the case of fast moving consumer goods, declining  demand. Consumer goods will not see much of an upturn. Rural  demand is not growing, and a poor monsoon will postpone  it further. This will be the determining factor in the fortunes  of consumer product companies. Conscientious ministers are saying  that analysts and commentators only see the dark side of  the economic picture. There are certainly bright spots.  Foreign exchange reserves are at record levels. Exports  are on the rise and we have a surplus with the United States  of America. With the abolition of reservations of garments  manufacture for small-scale industries, exports are booming.  India will be a strong player in the world after the abolition  of quotas in 2005.  Exports of food grains and gems  and jewellery remain buoyant. Industrial production is growing  after years of stagnation. Production capacity utilization  is reaching its limits and after a five-year hiatus investment  in capital goods might grow again. The rupee is rock solid,  and reverse currency flows into India are unabated. Indian  money is coming back for fear of losing local assets because  lenders can now take them over. Indians overseas feel that  India is a safer haven than many others including the US.  Dollar loans are flooding in. But looming over these is the  state of the world economy and particularly the US. The  US has within two years converted a huge and growing budget  surplus into a huge and growing deficit. Its overseas borrowings  are so large, that any loss of confidence will lead to default.  The US does not have the reserves to take back all the dollars  lying with foreign lenders and investors. The Iraq invasion  adds to the deficits. More overseas adventures will worsen  the situation. A reconstruction bonanza, even if it comes,  will be only a fraction of the exports that the US economy  needs to overcome its ranking as the worlds largest debtor  nation. India has now logged on to a new  Hindu rate of growth of between 5 to 6 per cent. The higher  inflation rate, if it can be capped at 6 per cent, could  add further to the growth impulses. But that seems unlikely.  The poor monsoon will hold back growth, but exports and  improving investment climate in industry could balance that  loss. The budget has done little to stimulate the economy.  Public investment might help the economy. But inflation  has to be pegged if interest rates are to remain low, rising  labour strife must moderate, savings must grow, infrastructure  and especially power must improve, user charges must more  reflect costs, fuel prices need to be regulated, infrastructure  tariffs and prices of basic goods must come out of opaque  government decision-making, and state and central expenditures  must come down. Most of these things will not happen for  the next two years. The economy is again hostage to politics.

 - It is time India and Bangladesh translate positive options  into operation  J.N. DIXIT The author is former foreign secretary  of India American military operations in  Iraq, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamalis  interaction for normalizing relations between India and  Pakistan, and the visits of the American deputy secretary  of state, Richard Armitage, and of the assistant secretary  of state for south Asian affairs, Christina Rocca, have  hogged both media and political attention in terms of Indias  external relations. In this pre-occupation, there is a general  trend of neglecting Indias relations with other neighbours  like Bangla- desh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, and others.  An indication of this neglect in public perception is the  visit by the foreign secretary, Kanwal Sibal, to Dhaka (which  took place in the fourth week of April), being more or less  ignored both in reportage and analyses. Sibals discussions at Dhaka was  the first high-level interaction after a gap of time in  a crucial political context. The meetings took place as  Vajpayee was commencing his latest initiative on normalization  of relations with Pakistan and as mutually critical rhetoric  about Bangladesh harbouring Pakistan sponsored terrorists  on its territory abated after reaching points of high controversy.  Sibals visit also took place in the context of Begum Khaleda  Zia not having paid a single visit to New Delhi after she  came to power this time in October, 2001. Vajpayee has not  visited Dhaka at all. It is time to indulge in an over-view  of India-Bangladesh relations after more than three decades  of Bangladesh emerging as an independent country.  First, the important position  which Bangladesh should occupy in our foreign policy scheme,  and the reasons for it. Bangladesh is the third most populous  country in sub-continental Asia. Strategically, it occupies  an important position in the northern segment of the Bay  of Bengal and along the coastline from Coxs Bazar down  to the western coastline of Myanmar. It is Indias third  largest trading partner with potentialities both as a market  and as an area of investment and transfers of technology  for mutual benefit. Bangladesh also lies athwart the northeastern  states of India and the rest of India. Its borders with Myanmar, and  with Manipur in India, add to Bangladeshs importance in  terms of Indias border security concerns in that region.  Bangladesh is an important link in the land and land-based  trading routes between south Asia and southeastern countries  stretching from Myanmar to Malaysia, including countries  of the former Indo-China region. Bangladesh is a repository  of natural gas reserves which could contribute to the energy  security of India, after fulfilling the needs of Bangladesh.  All this, apart from long-standing linguistic, cultural  and religious commonalties between the peoples of the two  countries transcending their respective national identities  or recent history. These factors, together with the  role that India played in supporting the liberation war  of Bangladesh, should have resulted in a substantive and  positive relationship between the two countries. This has  not happened because of some atavistic elemental factors  affecting Indo-Bangladesh relations. First, India expected  the general conformity pattern of gratitude from Bangladesh  for Indias support to that countrys liberation struggle.  Second, India, although sensitive to Bangla- deshs threat  perceptions because of being surrounded on three sides by  Indian states and the Bay of Bengal dominated by the Indian  navy in the south, has not been responsive enough in political  and security terms. Third, India has not been as forthcoming  in meeting Bangladeshs economic requirements because of  Indias narrower and short-term policy orientations on issues  related to trade and transit. Bangladeshs deliberately cultivating  a closer relationship with Pakistan under successive regimes  of the country since 1975-76 has not helped matters. In  fact, developments became more complicated with the Pakistani  inter-services establishment establishing a foothold for  its anti-India activities in Bangladesh nearly a decade  and half from the mid-Eighties of the last century onwards.  There has been delay in settling pending territorial issues  with Bangladesh, like the exchange of border enclaves, which  have been pending almost since the time of Indias partition.  The demographic pressure on land in Bangladesh has perhaps  unavoidably resulted in the illegal migration of Bangladeshis  into India. Instead of tackling the problem in human terms,  both India and Bangladesh have taken a political and rejectionist  stand on this important issue, Bangladesh saying there is  no illegal migration and India claiming exactly the opposite  and threatening to take punitive action against the phenomenon. Kanwal Sibal must have broadly  touched on all these factors affecting bilateral relations,  but the focus must have been on expanding bilateral economic  relations, finding ways to expand mutual cooperation against  international terrorism and for consolidating regional security,  as well as to see the extent to which Bangladesh would be  interested in cooperation in the energy sector with India.  Geo-strategic and general political benefits of mutual cooperation,  ensuring mutual security are too obvious and need no elaboration.  It is in the economic and technological fields that India  should be more forthcoming and generous while Bangladesh  should discard its irrational inhibitions about economic  cooperation with India.  The volume of Indias exports  to Bangladesh is of the order of $1 billion in terms of  formal exchange of goods. If informal trade is included,  Indias exports to Bangladesh would be of the order of nearly  $3 billion. Bangladesh is the third largest importer of  manufactured goods from India. Though Bangladeshs exports  to India have increased over the last 30 years, Bangla-  desh has an adverse balance of trade with India. Bangladeshs  trade deficit with India can be economically debilitating  with the passage of time. There are two broad steps which  can be taken to remedy this predicament. First, India should  extend unilateral free trade treatment to Bangladesh. Not  only would this result in the expansion of Bangladeshs  exports to India, but it would also help in reducing the  trade gap, and establishing strong and fair links between  the economies of Bangladesh and India. A positive political  fall-out of India playing a role in contributing to Bangladeshs  economic strength and development is obvious. Although India  has extended tariff concessions to Bangladesh off and on,  this has been done piece-meal and in an inhibited manner  which has only generated misunderstanding and apprehensions  in Bangladesh. The Indian governments approach of allowing  transit facilities through India to Bangladesh has been  conditional to Bangladesh giving reciprocal facilities to  India through its territories in Indias northeastern states.  Though this is a fair demand, perhaps India could extend  these concessions first, to which Bangladesh could respond  later after assessing the benefits of a mutually trustworthy  economic relationship. If Bangladesh gives up its political  inhibitions and decides to export its surplus natural gas  to India it would be a major step benefiting Bangladesh  and qualitatively reducing its adverse balance of trade  position with India. Although India does not have any intention  of making a demand on this subject or imposing on Bangladesh,  Bangladesh would be the loser if it does not take an early  positive decision in the matter. India is discovering new  oil and natural gas reserves on land and its coastal seas.  Multilateral financial institutions like the Asian Development  Bank are exploring oil and natural gas projects in central  Asia and west Asia, targeting the Indian import market.  India itself is investing in its energy security in countries  as far away as Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation on  the one hand and to Sudan on the other. It is for Bangladesh  to objectively calculate the implications of India moving  away to alternate sources of energy. If this happens, Bangladesh  would be sitting on an asset which it would not be able  to use as effectively as it can (if it does not move into  the Indian market).  The problems of illegal migration  and Pakistan-sponsored terrorist bases in Bangladesh need  to be addressed through a rational and cooperative approach.  Options regarding both these problems are available and  have been widely discussed. It is time that governments  of the two countries translate positive options into operation.  One hopes Sibals visit to Dhaka might have made a beginning  in this direction.

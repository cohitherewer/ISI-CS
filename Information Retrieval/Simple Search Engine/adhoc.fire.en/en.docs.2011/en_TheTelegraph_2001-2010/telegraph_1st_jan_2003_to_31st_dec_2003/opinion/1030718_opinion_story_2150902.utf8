 - More is needed from the Congress for successful coalition-building  Mahesh Rangarajan The author is an independent political  analyst and researcherThe Congress has spoken at last  in Shimla. It has taken more than a decade of minority governments,  coalitions and post- and pre-poll alliances to drive home  the simplest of home truths. There is no alternative to  sharing power in New Delhi. Those who are unwilling to share  the spoils of office or to apportion seats prior to the  polls have to remain content on the opposition benches.  In this crucial sense, Sonia Gandhi deserves plaudits for  taking her party into new, uncharted waters. This was a  necessary first step for retrieving the fortunes of Indias  oldest party at the national level. It is circumstances that have  forced a retreat from the Pachmarhi declaration that bound  the party to one-party rule. The real question still stares  the leadership in the face. How can it add to its 15 chief  ministers the post that has proved elusive since 1996: that  of a Congress prime minister? And it is here that the party  slipped even as it took the first step in the right direction.  Alliances and coalitions are built by careful and painstaking  negotiations, a process of give and take that is still new  to the Congress. Having run one-party governments virtually  without a break for most of independent Indias history,  the Congress has yet to pick up the rudiments of the art  of crafting a coalition. It is not just that the devil is  in the detail. It is also that the art of leading a multi-party  alliance requires that its prospective leader earn the trust  of smaller constituents. This is as crucial a requirement  as the programme of action that a group of parties might  share. The success stories in Indias  own past provide insights. The longest serving coalition,  the Left Front in West Bengal, had for a long stretch of  time as its leader Jyoti Basu, not just because he had no  challenger within his own party but also because the smaller  partners looked up to him. At the Union government level,  Atal Bihari Vajpayees greatest asset lies not within his  own sangh parivar (parts of which work like an in-house  opposition) but in the trust of his allies. None challenges  his leadership and all defer to his decision.  Yet the seeds of the success of  a Jyoti Basu or a Vajpayee were sown long before the power  was within their grasp. Basu acquired the image of a sober  parliamentarian in the Fifties and an able administrator  in the short-lived United Front regime in the Sixties. Vajpayee  made his mark as a parliamentarian in the Fifties and then  as an opposition leader before serving as a non-doctrinaire  foreign minister in 1977-79. These spells in public life  and then in lesser office prepared them for the unenviable  and arduous task of leading coalitions. Sonia had no record  in public life prior to 1998, and the family name means  little to prospective allies.  On the face of it, there is much  more to Sonia Gandhi going in her favour than meets the  eye. Her partys decline in vote base has been arrested  in 1999. It has come back to power in ten states and Union  territories where it was not in office in March 1998 when  she became Congress president. No prospective third front  exists as in the late Eighties and mid-Nineties. Her party  is therefore right in trying to forge a unified secular  alternative to the ruling National Democratic Alliance. Where it falters is in the way  it is trying to dictate terms to other political formations  from a public platform. For, shorn of the fine-tuning, the  Shimla conclave found the Congress admitting that it has  no option but to do business with more, not less parties.  But in underscoring that the issue of leadership is not  negotiable, it endangers itself in two crucial states. The obvious one is Maharashtra,  long a stronghold, and a state where it now shares power  with the breakaway Nationalist Congress Party. The Congress  has never, repeat never, come to power at the Centre without  winning the majority of the seats in the state. There is  no clarity yet on how to work out a seat-sharing arrangement  with Sharad Pawars party either for the state assembly  or the Lok Sabha elections due next year. Divided, they  will probably be beaten by the rival Shiv Sena-Bharatiya  Janata Party alliance. And by emphasizing Sonias primacy,  the larger party has made it impossible for the NCP to be  anything other than a pliant supplicant. The same situation is compounded  in the case of Uttar Pradesh. Unlike Pawar, Mulayam Singh  Yadav has not made an issue of the foreign origins of the  Congress president. Their discord relates to the Samata  Partys roots in anti-Congress politics and to the obvious  implications of who gets the larger slice within UP. With  its 80 seats, the state will be a major battleground in  election 2004. The fact is the Congress is a  shrunken presence in the state, with no social base worth  the name. It would of course be a great asset in pooling  together minority voters against the BJP, and also in unifying  all those who are against the politics of the chief minister  Mayavati. Such a minority-other backward classes alliance  with a section of savarnas will not be easy to put together.  But it is the only way a possible alliance of the BSP and  BJP can be held in check.  It is a measure of the distance  travelled by both the Samata Party and the Congress that  they are not training fire at each other. This still does  not mean it will be smooth sailing. Any line-up of forces  that brings together ex-socialists, regional parties and  the left in any form, will not be easy for Congress to control,  let alone master. It is this compulsive control and command  mentality of the Congress that may railroad such a line-up  even before it comes into being. The problem facing the party is  not an easy one. Since 1984, no party has won a majority  in the Lok Sabha. In the interim, the Congress has tried  out two routes. One was to run a minority government as  under P.V. Narasimha Rao. The other, also pioneered by him,  was the option of supporting a Centre-left coalition from  the outside. The former is not practicable, as Sonia herself  discovered in April 1999. The latter is not on the cards.  What the party is now trying out  is a third approach. It hopes to add to its own share of  seats and votes by roping in allies in key states where  weak. In turn, it holds out the prospect of office to those  who work in tandem with it. This in a sense would be the  partys answer to the NDA.  This is easier said than done.  To a far greater extent than its Hindutva rival, the Congress  has an all-India spread that makes it difficult to align  at poll time with the very forces it hopes to work with  after elections are over. Similarly, its relative inexperience  at coalition-building has led it to the vexed question of  leadership even before that of a programme. The cart has  been put before the horse.  The party may be on the right  track but the way it is going about its task may make the  NDA more unified and coherent. Such a denouement will disappoint  those who are in search of an alternative to the present  regime. The Congresss response, though welcome, falls short  of what is needed.

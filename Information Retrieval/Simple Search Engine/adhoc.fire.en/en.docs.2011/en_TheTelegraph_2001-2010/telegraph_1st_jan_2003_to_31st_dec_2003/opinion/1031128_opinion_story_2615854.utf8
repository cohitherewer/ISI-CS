		 Friday, November 28, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Kabir says, Im off to my weddingKabir: The Weavers Songs (Penguin, Rs 295) translated by Vinay Dharwadker is a valuable English edition of 100 poems, songs and aphorisms of one of Indias greatest mystics. Dharwadkers Kabir is also a satirist and philosopher, standing at the intersection of Islam and Hinduism, Bhakti and Yoga, immersed in theology and social thought, music and politics. These are limpid, moving translations, substantially introduced and annotated. There is an exhaustive bibliography and a detailed textual apparatus. In Wedding, Kabir sings, in Raga Gauri, about his bridegroom, King Rama: Three hundred and thirty million gods/ and eighty-eight thousand sages/ are here to attend/ the ceremony./ Kabir says, Im off to my wedding:/ Im marrying/ the Imperishable One. Leadership secrets from the  mahabharata (Penguin, Rs 125) by Meera Uberoi  attempts to read this epic as a conduct book for leaders,  comparable to The Prince or Tsun Zus The Art  of War. The wisdom is arranged under the following heads:  duty, war, spy, subject, friend, foe, counsellors, finance  and conduct. Most of the nuggets sound rather obvious and  dated when taken out of their complex, and often highly  ambiguous, human context. Some of the advice sounds comically  vicious and contradictory. War begins, harmlessly enough,  with Victory acquired by battle is very inferior, and  then goes on to this: He should bale out the waters of  all tanks in his dominions or if incapable of baling them  out, cause them to be poisoned. Guide to trekking in himachal  (Indus, Rs 275) by Minakshi Chaudhry is a  useful book with lots of information, maps and photographs,  and plenty of very sound advice drawing on the authors  own trekking experiences. But the trekker will have to plough  through a great deal of bad, gushy writing, most of which  could have been edited out of the book. The land of naked people: encounters  with stone age Islanders (Penguin, Rs 250) by  Madhusree Mukerjee is a very readable account of a physicists  encounters with the Sentinelese of the Andaman islands,  probably among the last of the planets first humans.  This is a rather guilt-tormented story of modernization  and colonization  the dedication is to natives unknown  on whose bones we stand. Juxtaposing personal experience  with anthropological gleanings, Mukerjees book is a way  of atoning for being an outsider who has been able to  get special access to a vanishing world.

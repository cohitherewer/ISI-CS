		 Monday, October 27, 2003  SLUGGISH PROSPECTS
 - The World Economic Survey has a lot to learn from  the East  S. VENKITARAMANAN The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India The International Monetary Fund  brings out a much-awaited forecast of the world economy  twice a year. The latest World Economic Outlook came  out in September 2003 and has put forth its analysis of  the prospects of the global economy for 2003 and 2004. It  estimates the global economy to grow at 3.2 per cent in  2003 and 4.1 per cent in 2004. In the advanced economies  of the United States of America, the European Union and  Japan, economic growth is expected to hit a low figure of  1.8 per cent in 2003 and 2.9 per cent in 2004. In particular,  the US, the main engine of growth for much of the world,  is expected to grow only at 2.6 per cent in 2003 and 3.9  per cent in 2004. Japan will record only 2 per cent growth  in 2003 and 1.4 per cent in 2004. These estimates are reminder  of how sluggish global economic prospects are with all their  implications for other countries. The brighter spots in the global  economy stakes seem to be India and China, which are clocking  relatively higher rates of growth. India is expected to  grow at 5.6 per cent in 2003 and at 5.9 per cent in 2004,  while China is expected to reach a rate of growth of 7.5  per cent in each of these two years. The estimated global  economic rate of growth  low as it is  is itself sustained  by these two economies. The WEO has assumed in its  calculations that their economies are weighted in accordance  with their gross domestic product valued at exchange rates  allowing for purchasing power parity. The WEO 2003 notes that  the greenback continued to depreciate through end May 2003,  reflecting the high current account deficits and fiscal  imbalance of the US. There has been, however, an upward  trend in private capital outflows on a global basis, peaking  at $110 billion in the year, the highest level since 1990.  In particular, an important feature of the global scenario  has been the behaviour of crude price, due to geopolitical  developments. It peaked at $ 34 a barrel pre-Iraq War and  declined sharply thereafter. In early September 2003, it  fell further. The WEO expects oil prices to fall  sharply in 2004 to $ 25.5 barrel. The WEO 2003, however,  is bullish about non-oil commodity prices  good news for  these developing countries, which are exporters of non-oil  commodities. Turning to the current structural  imbalance in the shape of high current account deficit of  the US, the WEO 2003 points out that the resulting  depreciation of the US dollar has so far been quite orderly  and generally welcome. The repercussions of the dollar decline  were offset in the EU area by reduction in the interest  rates. The WEO 2003, however, is of the view that  further US dollar devaluation cannot be ruled out. This,  of course, when it happens, would have serious repercussions,  particularly on export competitiveness of the EU economies,  if the pressure falls mostly on the euro. The WEO 2003 is convinced  that economic growth on a global scale is on an upward trend,  strengthened by reduced global tensions and a higher fiscal  stimulus in the US budget pipeline. Further contributory  factors are a decline in oil prices, relaxed interest rate  stance and easier credit policies. The WEO 2003,  however, estimates that the interest rate stimulus may be  withdrawn, come 2004, indicating that higher interest rates  may be around the corner by that time. The WEO estimates that  recovery at the global level will continue to be led by  the US economy, in spite of a weak labour market and large  excess capacity. Recent data from the US also show signs  of improvement, with higher fiscal stimulus on the cards.  The Japanese economy also seems to be on the mend, given  stronger than expected second quarter outturns. Japans  revival is, however, crucial as the global economy should  not depend only on the US for its sustained growth. That  will amount to flying on one engine, so to speak. Japanese  growth, in turn, depends on the USs growing fast, in as  much as Japan is an export-led economy. For the first time in recent years,  the WEO 2003 discounts the fears of global deflation.  In its view, the risk of a global deflationary spiral appears  remote as inflationary expectations have recently edged  up, reflecting increased expectations of recovery and recent  monetary and fiscal policy measures. However, in the event  of any adverse shock, such a development cannot be totally  ruled out. Germany may be one of the likely candidates for  such a deflationary outcome. Its degree of freedom is, however,  limited, constrained as Germany is by the fiscal limits  laid down by the Growth and Stability Pact, which prescribes  strict ceilings for fiscal deficits and public debt to GDP  ratio. Further, the external commercial borrowings have  not been quick to react to developments. The possibility  of Germany facing deflation cannot therefore be ruled out. As a contrast to its plea for  a stimulative stance on the EU, the WEO 2003 attacks  increased resort to public debt by poorer countries. In  a special section, the WEO 2003 stresses the need  for developing countries to be cautious about their current  levels of public debt. It points out that the public debt  as a percentage of GDP is high in developing countries.  It notes that the countervailing factors, which obtain in  developed countries, which have high debt-GDP ratios do  not occur in developing countries. One such factor is the  relatively low direct tax-GDP ratio in developing countries  compared to the higher ratios of developed countries. Further,  the effective rate of direct tax in developing countries   allowing for exemptions  is only 10 per cent compared  to 30 per cent in the developed world. Hence, in the WEOs  views, the developing countries have to practise an attitude  of caution when resorting to high public debt. The WEO 2003 is, however,  fair in pointing out that in spite of high levels of public  debt to GDP ratio, countries, like Malaysia and India, have  not suffered too perceptibly in their macroeconomic conditions.  This is because they have not resorted too much to external  debt. Perhaps the reason is also that they are still relatively  closed on the capital account.  The WEO 2003 stresses the  necessity for better exchange rate management practices,  in particular by developing countries. It devotes particular  attention to the high level of reserve accumulation by certain  emerging market economies, like China. It also stresses  the need for a more flexible exchange rate policy. It particularly  targets the fixed exchange rate policy of China, which  has been pegging its remninbi to the dollar at a constant  level since 1995. The implied pressure on China to revalue,  mentioned in the WEO 2003, is a reflection of the  US-centred approach of the Bretton Woods Institutions. It  is not, however, clear why China and other emerging market  economies should bear the pain of adjustment caused by the  USs economic imbalance. However, geopolitics has its own  logic or illogic, notwithstanding the fact that a considerable  part of the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves goes  towards funding the US budget deficit besides filling its  current account gap. The WEO 2003 has come at  a time when the world is starting to grow, based not only  on the USs demand, but on the growth of the emerging economies,  like China. The policies it advocates should be carefully  studied and responded to only if justified in the particular  situation of developing countries. It does not follow necessarily  that what is good for the US is good for the world economy  as a whole. The WEO should start learning and advocating  lessons based on the experience of countries, like China,  which have grown at a rapid pace over the last two decades.  It should not shy away from drawing lessons from the eastern  half of the world merely because they violate the Washington  Consensus. The WEO should make a departure by giving  due importance to Chinese experience. Perhaps, this is a suggestion  which will be treated with contempt by the pundits of Bretton  Woods. China has demonstrated that an economy can develop  starting from scratch, in spite of its not being overly  market-oriented but governed by a state, which rules with  a sharp focus on growth and equity. Chinas own focus on  infrastructure and small enterprises and agriculture has  itself been responsible for the scorching rate of growth,  which in turn has turned China into a magnet for FDI. It  is ironic that China today sustains the USs economic growth,  low as it is, by contributing as much as $100 billion a  year to investment in US securities. That is what helps  to keep US interest rates low and consumption levels higher.  A WEO which ignores the obvious lessons of Chinese  triumph against adversity cannot claim to be a truly world-oriented  outlook.

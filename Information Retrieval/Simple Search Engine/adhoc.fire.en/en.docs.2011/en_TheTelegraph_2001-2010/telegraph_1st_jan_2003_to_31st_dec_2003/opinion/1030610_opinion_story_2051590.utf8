		 Tuesday, June 10, 2003  IT IS STILL COLD BEYOND THE WALL
 China must think beyond Sikkim in  framing its India policy given the new warmth between India  and the US, write M.L. Sondhi and Ashok Kapur M.L. Sondhi is director, Institute  for Asia-Pacific Security Ashok Kapur is professor and chairperson,  department of political science, University of Waterloo, Canada Mind games  Beijings recent declaration to  solve the Sikkim dispute in return for better Indian understanding  of Chinas security concerns (Tibet? Taiwan? USA? India?  Japan?) is a meaningless ploy. The Sikkim question is now  moot. Its recognition by the Peoples Republic of China  would change nothing on the ground. Moreover, the territorial  issue concerns Arunachal Pradesh and Chinese possession  of a part of Kashmir. Chinese nuclear and missile supplies  to Pakistan, the demand for Indian nuclear disarmament,  it naval activity in Loco Islands and in Gwador, and building  of military airfield in Manually, the buildup of rail and  road links in Tibet, raise questions about Chinese strategic  intentions.  Beijing says that its relations  with India and Pakistan are independent of each other. Not  true. Pakistan is an extension of the China policy to maintain  and develop a line of military and diplomatic pressure against  India, and furthermore, Pakistan is the gateway to the Middle  East, including Saudi Arabia for China. Chinas Pakistan  policy is thus aimed at Indian as well as American interests,  and Western political establishments quite understand this.  So unless the Beijing establishment is willing to make a  realistic assessment of its internal and its external situation,  a reliance on peace mantra by China (or by India) will take  India and China the way of the recent Russia-China summit,  where little was achieved.  If the formula is to claim that  relative stability exists between the two, then that too  is a fiction because it requires continuous military development  by the two, and peace diplomacy no longer suffices. To secure  a breakthrough, Beijing must decide if it recognizes Indias  strategic and diplomatic importance in the region or if  it feels that it can continue to toy with Indian sensitivities  on important issues. Judging by past history, the negotiating  style of the Chinese mandarins will be to talk sweetly,  be evasive about specific issues and try to get a sense  of Indian political will and the direction of its military  policy and its alignment with the United States of America  and other friendly Asian powers. Right now, there is no  sign that China takes India seriously. Indian security concerns vis--vis  China are well known. What are Beijings? They lie in two  types of development. The first is the emergence of a new,  engagement-oriented Indian political class that is represented  by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the National Democratic Alliance  coalition. Beijing is following the Aristotelian dictum  that action is the ruling law of drama. The Indian drama  is revealed by its nuclear and missile developments, by  the prospect of more nuclear testing if circumstances merit  this action. Indian missile defence, Indian engagement with  Pakistani terrorism and strengthening of democracy in Kashmir,  a positive attitude towards the use of coercive diplomacy  as well as naval deployment in the Indian Ocean area. These  are the actions which are meant to register on the China-Pakistan  mind which is inseparable.  The Vajpayee-NDA coalitions pragmatic  attitude to economic reforms also increases Indian economic  energies and confidence in the ability to treat Chinas  economic growth as a challenge to Indian talent and industry.  So even as China has a fantastic economy (although figures  are hard to furnish given the lack of financial transparency  in China) and it is flooding the Indian market with its  cheap goods, the Indian manufacturing base and export trade  is growing, and it attracts Western attention. Now India  has an upward trajectory in the strategic and the economic  spheres, and this points to a long-term competition between  the two civilizations.  Chinas dream following the collapse  of the Soviet Union was to become the sole Asian military  and economic hegemony. But this is being challenged by its  neighbours, from Japan to India. Chinas new leaders should  be studying the net assessments that come from American,  European and Indian think-tanks and base their policies  on such objective indicators of the future rather than the  subjective reality of placating their old tired hardliners. The second impetus for major change  comes from the USs recognition that China has global strategic  ambitions which can affect American authority and influence.  The threats affect the USs vital interests in Asia and  the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. The US  not only  the president, but institutions like the Pentagon  think  strategically, and the centre of their thought and action  concerns the management and the flow of power from the Middle  East (Mediterranean eastwards), Asia (central Asia, eastwards  and southwards), and in the Indian as well as the Pacific  Oceans. American military power is there to stay in Iraq,  Afghanistan, bases in central Asia, and while the location  of Americas military presence is moving from, say, Okinawa  and South Korea to Australia and the Philippines, the range  of American military thought and planning is broadening  and deepening.  The US-India defence cooperation  is a sign of the new, smart and strategic thinking and policy  action on both sides. Time is not on Chinas side, as Japan,  India, Australia, the US, Singapore, Philippines and others  in Asia and the Middle East see the value of fighting terrorism  by military action, and the value of building traditional  as well as non-traditional alliances. Southwest Asia, the  Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia, along with central  Asia, are the new international centres of importance. Military  buildups, alliances and economic development through privatization  are the themes now.  A sign of the new times is that  the US is allowing Israel to sell the Phaicon airborne warning  and control system to India but not to China. George W.  Bush, unlike Bill Clinton, is not receptive to the business  community and open to Chinese economic blandishments. The  Arrow-2 anti-missile system is also being considered for  supply to India. The Phaicon and the Arrow change the military  equation in Asia significantly.  So the issue for the Indian leadership  is not Sikkim, it is much bigger. And Chinas new and comparatively  inexperienced leadership may need to reflect on the new  realities and their implications for Chinas dealings with  India. China must now recognize the reality of a de facto  Asian NATO. This is not merely a military grouping. It has  a democratic base which brings together Israel, India, Japan,  Australia, southeast Asian nations, Taiwan and the US together,  and fuels the demand for Tibetan autonomy. An Asian NATO  also has immense geo-political significance. It brings pressure  on China to either go it alone, as it is accustomed to do  historically, and to rely on the Middle Kingdom complex,  and pay a high cost for its military buildup or to make  major changes in its attitudes and actions, and to think  beyond Sikkim in its policy towards India.

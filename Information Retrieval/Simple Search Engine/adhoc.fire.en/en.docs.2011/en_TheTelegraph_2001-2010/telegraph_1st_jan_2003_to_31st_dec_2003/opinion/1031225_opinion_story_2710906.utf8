The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Thursday, December 25, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Recipe for happiness				 																																																				Sir  It is true that divorce rates are going up and that for many couples it is more coexist unhappily than live happily ever after, but it is laughable to think that pre-marital training can mend matters (In sickness and in health, Dec 23). Happiness cannot be taught, respect for the other develops, and the rose-tinted glasses fall off on their own. The increasing failure of todays generation to make marriages tick must be seen together with the increasing dysfunctioning of other close relations  with parents, siblings, in the workplace. So it will be futile to teach someone to be a good husband unless he is also a good son, a good brother and a good colleague. Also, all this hoo-ha about rising divorce rates is a little excessive. One, it is specific to urban India, and two, divorce is not such a big tragedy. In many cases, it is better to break free instead of sticking to a marriage gone wrong as the older generation would have done. Perhaps, it is time to start a course called, Life after divorce.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,  Sumana Sarkar, Calcutta 
				 																																																				Sage advice				 																																																				Sir  The report, Atal tars Judeo with Jogi brush (Dec 17), says that by equating Dilip Singh Judeo with Ajit Jogi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee attempted to regain moral high ground. Vajpayee is a politician par excellence who has never lost his moral high ground. It is for this reason that he is so respected, both in India and abroad. 				 																																																				It may be remembered that on July 31, 2001, Vajpayee offered to resign as prime minister, owning moral responsibility for the National Democratic Alliances inefficiency and the failure to hold his allies together. It takes a lot of courage for a prime minister to make such an offer. In his half-a-century-old political career, Vajpayee has always stood for transparency and probity in public life. Vajpayee is right in saying that the malaise in politics arises out of a degeneration of moral and cultural values. 				 																																																				Vajpayee is the Bhishma Pitamaha of modern Indian politics who is fulfilling his rashtra dharma by reminding his fellow politicians of their duty towards democracy and to maintain discipline in Parliament. It would be unfortunate if our politicians do not take advantage of his wisdom.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Srinivasan Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

				 																																																				Sir  By tarring both Ajit Jogi and Dilip Singh Judeo with the same brush  for bringing disgrace on the institution of democracy  the prime minister has risen above the partisanship and mudslinging that characterize contemporary politics. Not condoning Judeo  despite the resounding success in Chhattisgarh  is sure to send the right message across and will help morality make a belated comeback in politics, especially with the new anti-defection bill in place.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Raghubir Singh, Pune

				 																Get the facts right				 																																																				Sir  Bappa Majumdars Bleak dossier on bad blood (Nov 22) is full of wrong information. Thalassaemia is a genetic disorder that stops a person from leading a normal life, mainly by delaying clotting, the report says. Actually, thalassaemia is a genetic disorder of haemoglobin synthesis that leads to shortened life span of red blood cells and anaemia. The author seems not to know the difference between haemophilia, a clotting disorder, and thalassaemia, a haemolytic anaemia. 				 																																																				The report also says that 40 per cent of intermediate thalassaemia (the term is thalassaemia intermedia) patients are unaware that they risk developing thalassaemia major. No scientific basis for such a fear exists. The author adds, Thalassaemia major, a much more serious trait. The word, trait, in medical terminology, is used for someone who has one gene of a recessive disease. A disease, like thalassaemia, is manifest only when someone inherits two abnormal genes from carrier or trait parents. The report quotes a health department official: There has been an alarming spurt in thalassaemia intermedia. The genetic alteration for thalassaemia has been present in the population for thousands of years. There cannot be a sudden spurt in thalassaemia like malaria or hepatitis. 				 																																																				At the end comes the claim that 50 per cent of the population are carriers of thalassaemia. This contradicts all published data, as well as research done over several decades on a large cross-section of the population, which includes different ethnic groups. Any survey that finds a 50 per cent carrier incidence among 300 people must have either a bias in case selection or have used a faulty method for carrier detection. The incidence of the beta thalassaemia gene varies from one to 17 per cent in our country, with an average of 3.3 per cent.

				 																Plastic menace				 																																																				Sir  The British move to include a statutory warning on loan offer documents is a welcome step (Credit card wealth alert, Dec 10). Easy access to credit has already ruined some families in India  many have been reported to commit suicide, unable to pay back loans. But society need not have any misplaced sympathy for habitual borrowers, or for the trouble they face from goons or eunuchs hired by loan providers to realize it. It is a misfortune they have brought upon themselves. 				 																																																				Easy access to credit, especially car loans, is also inconveniencing pedestrians. Indians may have the worlds cheapest car but they have to keep it parked on footpaths, as the financier does not pay for garage space, forcing pedestrians to walk on the road. These car owners lack basic road manners  they honk near hospitals, exceed the stop line at traffic intersections and drive crazily at night. It is time we considered such alerts in India too.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Pal, Batanagar

				 																																																				Sir  Trust the British to be flag-bearers of civilization in a world of debit and credit cards. The wealth warnings on credit cards are welcome as it is time something was done to curb the plastic menace. Though this cannot be the sole weapon to combat a culture of debt, it is a start and will go a long way to dampen the enthusiasm of credit card companies. Especially since the law also envisages advertising regulations where the key issues will have to be printed prominently on the copy. The same should also be implemented in India. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Arta Mishra, Cuttack

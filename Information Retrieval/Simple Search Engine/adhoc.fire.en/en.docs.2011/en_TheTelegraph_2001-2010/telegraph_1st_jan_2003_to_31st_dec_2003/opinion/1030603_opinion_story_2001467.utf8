		 Tuesday, June 03, 2003  MACHISMO IS NOT THE ANSWER
 - There is no clearly defined vision for aerospace in the  Indian strategic consciousness  BRIJESH D. JAYAL The author is a retired air marshall  of the Indian air force A modern combat aircraft is a  demanding design, development and management challenge on  whose success or failure rests not only the future of the  organization developing it, but also the operational potential  of the sponsoring air forces. Not surprisingly, aerospace  industries by and large prefer to keep away from the public  gaze till completion of the task. Observers of the Indian  aeronautical scene are by now accustomed to periodic publicity  blitzes concerning the light-combat aircraft. The ceremonial  roll-out in 1995, engine start in 1998, first flight of  the technology demonstrator in 2001, brief fly-pasts during  Aero India shows of 2001 and 2003 and the latest christening  of the aircraft as Tejas, are some occasions that come to  mind. As milestones in the development  of modern combat aircraft therefore go, the recent christening  was no more than symbolic. Coming from the hands of the  prime minister, however, observers were eagerly anticipating  much more than symbolism, particularly as the geo-political,  security and economic environment at home and abroad have  undergone a sea change since the LCA was first conceived  two decades ago. Today Indian aerospace in particular and  the defence industry in general find themselves at a historic  crossroads. Whether the Indian aerospace industry becomes  a key player in the burgeoning and fiercely international  aerospace market or continues to play a peripheral role  depends largely on the strategic importance Indian security-planners  place on this vast human and infrastructural asset. The birth of the LCA programme  was the coming together of two parallel interests. One was  the Indian air forces desire for an indigenous replacement  to its vast fleet of Mig-21 aircraft, which were to commence  a progressive phase-out from the mid-Nineties. The second  was the desire of the scientific community to integrate  efforts towards a prestigious aircraft programme; peeved  as it was at the scuttling by vested interests of the aerospace  groups proposal to set up an integrated management system  for the development of missiles and aeronautics. Today,  while both objectives still remain somewhat distant, much  knowledge and experience have been gained and a last window  of opportunity to make amends may not last much longer. While it is to the credit of security-planners  of the time that they displayed vision in sanctioning the  project, the complexity and management challenges that a  programme of this magnitude would entail were not fully  appreciated. The project was to be overseen by a society  through tiered committees; a model of management not attempted  anywhere else in the aeronautical world. In the event, the  programme came to be controlled solely by the defence research  and development organization, a department in the ministry  of defence, and neither tasked nor equipped to handle such  a programme.  It needs no corporate guru to  tell us that such projects need dynamic and result-oriented  management models based on decentralization and accountability  as against staid bureaucratic control, which is the very  opposite. The tremendous achievement of our designers and  engineers in reaching even the present milestone, therefore,  is all the more praiseworthy when one considers this management  infirmity. Ironically, once the programme got under way,  the spirit of an integrated management system that the aerospace  group had visualized seems to have evaporated under the  very stewardship of the community that had sponsored the  idea. While there is much to celebrate  now that two technology demonstrator aircraft are flying,  the euphoria must be tempered. Its still a long haul to  a stage when an operational weapon system will be in the  hands of our frontline IAF squadrons. If this can happen  by 2015, we should pat ourselves on the back. Those who  talk of a few years are deluding themselves and the nation.  Indeed, if our security-planners desire this Herculean objective  to be achieved, then there are urgent lessons to be learnt.  It is in this context that the defence ministers statement  during the christening ceremony that the government will  set up a separate department to ensure that no further hurdles  come in the way of manufacturing Tejas is disappointing  and appears self-defeating.  So far the programme has been  controlled solely by departments within the ministry of  defence and hurdles that the minister talks of are both  systemic and endemic. They cannot be wished away. Creation  of yet another department will entail another centre of  authority without consequential accountability, and problems  will merely multiply. Unless our planners recognize  that the design and development of a modern combat aircraft  need not just technical talent but also a host of allied  specializations which contribute to efficient project management,  and that freeing such projects from our bureaucratic style  of working is a prerequisite for success, the LCA programme  may continue to limp to oblivion. Along the way, there will  be plenty of photo opportunities for cutting ribbons and  public relations pronouncements just to keep the adrenalin  flowing and egos on a high. It is precisely because we have  attempted a flawed management model that the LCA programme  has failed to achieve its potential. If we still chose to  press on regardless, then we are missing the last chance  for aeronautics in India. Much has changed in the international  arena from the time the LCA project was first conceived.  While there are denial regimes by industrial nations towards  specific strategic systems, today many of these countries  also consider India as a strategic ally. Globalization of  the economy introduces its own dynamics and opportunities.  The erstwhile Soviet industry on which the IAF was almost  totally dependent has downsized and reorganized to meet  challenges of the international marketplace. Their aircraft  are internationally priced and even fitted with Western  systems of customers choice, but no more are they available  at friendship prices. The age-old buyer-seller relationship  is now graduating towards joint programmes, of which the  prime minister mentioned the Brahmos. Today, the government  has invited the private sector to be partners in defence  production and there is an enthusiastic response. On the other hand, the development  and production of modern high-technology weapon systems,  more so combat aircraft, is a hugely capital-intensive exercise  which straddles security, economic, diplomatic, commercial,  trade and other vital national interests. It must therefore  fit into the larger national strategic canvas. Press reports  talk of joint development of a fifth-generation fighter  with Russians. One wonders whether such a major programme  fits into any strategic aerospace or security plan of the  nation or indeed if such plans exists in the first place.  Amortization of design costs and  economies of scale for production demand international collaborations  and partnerships not only by aerospace industries across  countries but also by user air forces as well. As aero India  shows demonstrate, aerospace industries of many countries  would like to forge partnerships and joint ventures with  Indian aerospace. One recognizes that such interest is by  no means charitable, but based on the hard commercial realization  that partnership with Indian aerospace and defence can lead  to mutually beneficial ventures. These are issues that need  deliberation and direction at the apex security level. While slogans of self-reliance  hold good for specific strategic weapons and systems, some  of which are covered by denial regimes, our effort in the  past at blindly trumpeting self-reliance has merely meant  licence production and using imported systems in indigenous  platforms. Overseas dependence has remained. Production  of the Mig-21 aircraft from raw materials in India was hailed  as a beacon of self-reliance. Yet when the Soviet Union  collapsed, the IAF product support dried up. This example  alone must drive home the reality of a modern aerospace  industry. Today aircraft manufacture is  a multi-dimensional venture. Manufacturers source engines  and systems from across the world. Even the Russians have  adopted this practice and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited  regularly provides components to international programmes  like the Airbus. The secret is to blend the best from possible  sources into a superior and competitive aircraft. The Indian  aerospace industry has many areas of strength, but a desire  to be macho and do everything on ones own is not the answer. What concerns students of security  and aeronautics in this country is the absence of a clearly  defined vision for aerospace in our national strategic consciousness.  Alongside atomic energy and space, aerospace is one area  that involves application of latest technology and its technological  and economic spin-offs for the rest of the economy are substantial.  It is also an area where India has considerable expertise  and infrastructure built at great public cost. If the nation  is serious about capitalizing on this vast potential, the  answer does not lie in more government control.  On the contrary, a broad based,  permanent and accountable aerospace board with executive  and financial authority should be tasked to deliver on a  national aerospace plan and to put Indian aerospace on the  world-map. International recognition will then deservedly  follow without the oxygen of frequent public relations exercises.

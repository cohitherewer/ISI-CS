 															- Document  Extracts from the Madrid International  Plan of Action on Ageing, April 2002 				 	 Give her a hand																								We recognize that globalization and interdependence are opening new opportunities through trade, investment and capital flows and advances in technology, including information technology, for the growth of the world economy and the development and improvement of living standards around the world. At the same time, there remain serious challenges, including serious financial crises, insecurity, poverty, exclusion and inequality within and among societies. Considerable obstacles to further integration and full participation in the global economy remain for developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, as well as for some countries with economies in transition. Unless the benefits of social and economic development are extended to all countries, a growing number of people in all countries and even entire regions will remain marginalized from the global economy. We must act now in order to overcome those obstacles affecting peoples and countries and to realize the full potential of opportunities...																								Globalization offers opportunities and challenges. The developing countries and countries with economies in transition face special difficulties in responding to those challenges and opportunities. Globalization should be fully inclusive and equitable, and there is a strong need for policies and measures at the national and international levels, formulated and implemented with the full and effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to help them respond effectively to those challenges and opportunities. 																								In order to complement national development efforts, enhanced international cooperation is essential to support developing countries, least developed countries and countries with economies in transition in implementing the International Plan of Action, 2002, while recognizing the importance of assistance and the provision of financial assistance, inter alia, by: 																								Recognizing the urgent need to enhance coherence, governance and consistency in the international monetary, financial and trading systems. To contribute to that end, we underline the importance of continuing to improve global economic governance and to strengthen the United Nations leadership role in promoting development. With the same purpose, efforts should be strengthened at the national level to enhance coordination among all relevant ministries and institutions. Similarly, we should encourage policy and programme coordination of international institutions and coherence at the operational and international levels to meet the...goals of sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development. 																								Noting the important efforts under way to reform the international financial architecture, which need to be sustained with greater transparency, and the effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition. One major objective of the reform is to enhance financing for development and poverty eradication. We also underscore our commitment to sound domestic financial sectors, which make a vital contribution to national development efforts as an important component of an international financial architecture that is supportive of development. 																								Calling for speedy and concerted action to address effectively debt problems of least developed countries, low-income developing countries and middle-income developing countries in a comprehensive, equitable development oriented and durable way through various national and international measures designed to make their debt sustainable in the long term, including, as appropriate, existing orderly mechanisms for debt reduction such as debt swaps for projects. 																								Recognizing that a substantial increase in official development assistance and other resources will be required if developing countries are to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration.  TO BE CONCLUDED

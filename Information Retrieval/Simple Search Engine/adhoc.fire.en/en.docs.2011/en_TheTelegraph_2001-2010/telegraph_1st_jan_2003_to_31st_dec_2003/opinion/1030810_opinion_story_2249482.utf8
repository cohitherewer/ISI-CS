The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, August 10, 2003  LEAVING CALCUTTA
 - The modern and the pre-modern in one location  Amit Chaudhuri amitchaudhurihotmail.com In the same map  To leave Calcutta is to make a  journey  as provisional as the one I made to arrive here  not long ago. Some journeys seem easier than others; the  one to Oxfords Broad Street, for instance; while the one  that would take me into Chittaranjan Avenue, toward the  CIT Buildings in which my aunt lives, remains unmade. Then  there are other departures, to Ashoknagar, Birati, or Subhasgram,  which seem to me now more fantastic than my travels to Europe  or America. On the one hand is the Jessore  Road, that winding alley that takes me to my cousins home  in Ashoknagar. At the other end, one takes the stifled lane  that improvises its unflagging route through the increasingly  populous settlements of Jadavpur and Bagha Jatin. This is  life  tottering, brimming  as I have known it, and will  never know it. Nothing in my widest travels prepares me  for the culture shock of Bengal. Those who dont believe  that pre-modernity and modernity can simply exist in an  idyllicized space called India must find other means of  describing their experience as they travel through these  highways. The subaltern historians have turned to critiquing  the European and universal language of modernity. Others  have had recourse to science fiction. By science fiction I dont mean  the narrative, or the features, of an imagined future; I  mean the sort of narrative that confronts the dilemma of  discovering the pre-modern and modern in one location. Theres  a certain kind of science fiction sensibility  among  whose most respectable expression is Kubricks 2001:  A Space Odyssey  that separates these elements (the  pre-modern and modern; the past, the present, the future)  into a linearity, a teleology of progress. In Kubricks  film, an ape in pre-history flings a bone into space, into,  literally, empty, homogeneous time, and, in the blink  of an eye, in a millennial split-second, it has become a  21st century spacecraft.  On the other hand, there is the  sensibility of an Andrei Tarkovsky or an O.V. Vijayan, which  radicalizes our faith in the human story of progress; for  them, science fiction describes not so much a dystopia  or utopia, as the world we already inhabit. As you travel  out of Calcutta, you realize the Jessore Road is not a teleology.  To take these highways, to go to Subhasgram, as I did last  month  to attend our cooks daughters wedding  is to  be involved in, to borrow a science-fiction phrase from  Ashis Nandy, time-travel. But the time on these roads  is not vacuum-like, transparent, like Wellss time, or Kubricks;  it is resistant; it shatters into pieces when you push against  it.  Aparnas house was our first stop.  Aparna (Ive changed her name), who looks after our daughter.  Ive joked often, Were going to visit your house soon;  now she held me to that promise. If youre coming to Shibanis  daughters wedding, you must come to my house. They  Aparna  and Shibani  both live in Subhasgram. So we get off our  cars at the railway crossing; a variety of the young  myself,  my wife, Aparna  help the aged  my mother, my mothers  brother (my father says he needs no help)  across the railway  tracks. A narrow, curving road brings us to the colony;  a long line of bricks which serves as a path takes us past  houses till we turn left towards her home.  She serves us tea and shingara;  shes served the same things to us before; but today we  are her guests. This brings to the act of serving an overlapping  of registers, the inuring familiarity of duty qualified  by the quotation marks of housepride and independence. We  can sympathize with her now, sitting on a bed, for the kitchen,  a tiny space segregated only by two saris hanging  before it. But it is hers. With one eye, shes still minding  our daughter, who, at five, is the only one who doesnt  understand the significance of being here. The lights go off. Dont worry,  she says, therell be a generator at the wedding. Her  looks, in a classically modern way, are redolent of the  20th century. She eloped with her husband, a professional  typist, before taking her matriculation exams. But she is  educated, and has more than a smattering of English. We  are poor, but we are proud, was one of the first things  she said solemnly to my mother; it was a statement made  in English. Where exactly the pride lies isnt always easy  to discern, but Ive never doubted her words. Shes one  of the handful of extraordinary women Ive known in my life;  and, equally, like most human beings, like humanity itself,  she is disappointing. When she used to help my daughter  with the English alphabet, I used to wonder  does a part  of her envy the child? Does she fear her imminent redundancy? The lights hadnt come back when  it began to get dark. Wed have to move on now to the wedding.  I held my mothers hand in the bad light; guided her down  the path of bricks embedded in the earth. Cones of mosquitoes  formed and disintegrated above us. It would take us ten  minutes to walk to the wedding  too long a way for my uncle,  who has arthritis. So we got into our cars. The cars, like  beasts, went circling round the paths of Subhasgram, their  headlights illuminating an abandoned zamindari house,  or falling upon a government building. We approached a wedding,  but not the one we wanted; it felt like wed never arrive.  After thirty five minutes we did; but it had rained here,  and the path of bricks, surrounded by water, wasnt easy  for the older members of our group to traverse. Finally,  we were in the room with the bride, sitting on a bed in  her red Benarasi. The groom hadnt come yet; our  arrival provided a substitute form of excitement. We noticed  how much the bride resembled her mother. As I write this, I face two temptations.  One is to say to myself, to the government: You havent  done enough; youve done next to nothing. The other is  to be somehow true to the life, the contemporaneity, of  Subhasgram; of the wedding; of Aparnas house. How do I  do this without aestheticizing my experience; without making  my narrative entirely about myself? Perhaps I might resort  to the idea of science fiction, of time-travel. I dont  mean, impossibly, that Ive travelled from the present to  the past, where things are less developed, but, inwardly,  more whole. I mean an idea of the future, which is always  disjunctive according to the standards of the present, but  which is, in the end, our home; and, at the same time, a  critique of the fictional notion that the future is waiting  to happen  that, although we have left 1984 and 2001 behind  on our calendars, they will still come. Having travelled  between Subhasgram and Ballygunge, I think we already inhabit  the future weve been waiting for. Here, Tarkovskys science fiction  is paradigmatic. For its not so much the future he shows  us in films like Stalker, but a present made disjunctive  and heterogeneous, a single site where tomorrows science  and yesterdays religion co-exist in a way to make the opposition  between tomorrow and yesterday problematic; not the complete  and self-sufficient past, present, and future of Hollywood  movies. How do you explain this sensibility? It might have  to do with the fact that Tarkovsky was Russian; and to be  a Russian in the Soviet Union was to be not wholly Western.  The playwright Heiner Muller, who chose to live in East  Germany after the war, spoke, in an interview in 1988, of  the artificiality of space, time, and freedom in the West:  The artificiality of this freedom is based on the fact  that West Germany couldnt function if  people from  poor  countries didnt do the dirty work or the service work.  In our countries, in our bloc, we are on the contrary in  some sort of osmosis with the Third World. Russia is just  a very small part of the Soviet Union. Its population is  minimal in relation to the Asian provinces There is much  more Third World inside the Soviet Union than in the United  States. With hindsight, this might seem ingenuous; but  it is instructive and proper, I think, to situate Tarkovskys  work not only in high European culture, but in the history  of that osmosis. We, too  I, and the reader of  this column  live in what forms a small part of India,  Bengal, Calcutta; we not only live in the Third World,  but are involved, spiritually, in some sort of osmosis  with it. Muller goes on to say: The main function of alternative  movements in the West is to establish in its midst islands  of the Third World. West Berlin has become the third biggest  Turkish city in the world This is a very positive phenomenon.  And what can we say of this city? Might we call Subhasgram  a positive phenomenon? And is Subhasgram the Third World  settlement, or Ballygunge the encampment? Does Subhasgram  live and grow in and inflect Calcutta, or is the opposite  true? To have been there is to have my assumption of where  I am turned inside out  not like an old sock, or an empty  bag, but a body that cant be contained in its skin.

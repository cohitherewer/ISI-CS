		 Monday, March 24, 2003 				 VIOLATIONS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES
 															- DOCUMENT Extracts from the anti-doping code adopted  by more than 80 countries at the World Conference on Doping  in Sports in Copenhagen, March 3-5				 	 Fight to the finish																								In circumstances where the athlete or the athletes team has been removed from a competition and the subsequent B sample analysis does not confirm the A sample finding, if, without otherwise affecting the competition, it is still possible for the athlete to be reinserted, the athlete may continue to take part in the competition. (For example, if an athlete is entered in more than one event and the second has not commenced, it may be possible for him to enter the second event. Similarly, depending upon the relevant rules of the international federation in a team sport, if the team is still in competition, the athlete may be able to take part in future games.)																								Each signatory shall provide a hearing process for any person who is asserted to have committed an anti-doping rule violation that respects the following principles: a timely hearing; fair and impartial hearing body; the right to be represented by a counsel at the persons own expense; the right to be fairly informed of the asserted anti-doping rule violation; the right of each party to call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses (subject to the hearing bodys discretion to accept testimony by written submission); the persons right to an interpreter at the hearing where necessary, at no cost to the person; and a timely, written, reasoned decision.																								An anti-doping rule violation in connection with an in-competition test automatically leads to disqualification of the individual result obtained in that competition with all resulting consequences, including forfeiture of any medals, points and prizes. (...A competition would include a single race, match, game or similar singular athletic contest.)																								...An anti-doping rule violation occurring during or in connection with an event may, upon the decision of the ruling body of the event, lead to disqualification of all of the athletes individual results obtained in that event with all consequences, including forfeiture of all medals, points and prizes. (...The term even means a series of individual competitions conducted as part of a larger event, for example, the Olympic Games.)																								...The consequence to the competitive results obtained by a team, of which any of the members has been found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation, shall be as provided in the rules of the applicable international federation.																								...The period of ineligibility imposed for a violation... shall be:																								First violation: Two years ineligibility.																								Second violation: Lifetime ineligibility.																								...A second anti-doping rule violation may be considered for purposes of imposing sanctions only if the anti-doping organization can establish that the athlete...committed the second anti-doping rule violation after he...received notice, or the anti-doping organization made a reasonable attempt to give notice, of the first violation. 																								The prohibited list may identify specified stimulants which are particularly susceptible to unintentional anti-doping rules violations because of their general availability in medicinal products and which are less likely to be successfully abused as doping agents. Where an athlete can clearly establish that the use of such a specified stimulant was for therapeutic purposes and was not intended to enhance sport performance, the period of ineligibility shall be:																								First violation: at a minimum, a warning and reprimand and no period of ineligibility from future events, and at a maximum, six months ineligibility.																								Second violation: Two years ineligibility.																								Third violation: Lifetime ineligibility.																								Where an athlete, based on a single test, is found to have committed a...violation involving both a specified stimulant and another prohibited substance or method, the athlete shall be considered to have committed a single anti-doping rule violation, but the sanction imposed shall be based on the prohibited substance or method that carries the most severe sanction.																								Where an athlete is found to have committed two separate violations, one involving a specified stimulant...and the other involving a prohibited substance or method... the period of ineligibility imposed for the second offence shall be at a minimum two years ineligibility and at a maximum two years and six months ineligibility. Any athlete found to have committed a third violation involving any combination of specified stimulants and any other anti-doping rule violation shall receive a sanction of lifetime ineligibility.																								The periods of ineligibility provided above may be lessened or eliminated in proportion to the exceptional circumstances of a particular case, but only if the athlete can clearly establish that the anti-doping rule violation was not the result of his or her fault or negligence. TO BE CONCLUDED

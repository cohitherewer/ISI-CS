		 Friday, February 07, 2003 				 SHOWCASING INDIA FOR THE RAJ
																								On August 14, 1905, some dignitaries of the city of Bombay resolved to build a memorial for the visit of the Prince of Wales (later George V). Three months later, the foundation stone of the museum was laid by the man after whom it was named. Its location was the Crescent Site. Following the fashion, the museum, which was opened to the public in January 1922, has now been renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sanghrahalaya. The building is spectacular, with beautiful gardens. This book, JEWEL ON THE CRESCENT by Kalpana Desai (Mapin, Rs 2,500), lavishly produced and illustrated, showcases some of the masterpieces in the museum. The picture alongside is a Mughal miniature (circa 1620-1630) which depicts the Madonna and infant Jesus, an unusual subject for a Mughal painter. It belonged originally to the collection of Nana Phadnis. The museum also houses a magnificent collection of ancient Indian sculptures.

		 Thursday, August 28, 2003  A VERY INDIAN NEOLIBERALISM
 The Supreme Courts judgment on strikes  points to the gathering of societys biases in favour of the  rich and the powerful, writes Achin Vanaik The author is a political scientist  and has recently published the book, Communalism Contested:  Religion, Modernity and Secularization		 Labour's lossThe Supreme Courts recent decision  to deny public sector workers the right to strike on any  grounds whatsoever and to justify this extraordinary act  in the name of protecting public interest is nothing less  than surprising. Equally disturbing is how that part of  the Indian media with national reach and influence has,  with a few honourable exceptions, welcomed this decision.  The growing elitism and conservatism of our judiciary has  become obvious in one judgement after the other, from that  on Hindutva to the more recent one on the two-child  norm in relation to panchayati office. The members  of the judiciary like those in other professions cannot  but be shaped by the wider ideological climate in which  the middle classes and elites operate. Today that ideological  common sense is shaped by neoliberalism. Although neoliberalism is primarily  an ideology about economic organization, it cannot but have  a profound effect on political and social life as well.  The states welfare and social roles are to be greatly reduced  where it cannot be fully eliminated while its policing functions  are to be enhanced. Thus the transition from a welfarist  state to a competitive state requires privatization of  public services as far as possible and their transformation  into privately available commodities. Education and healthcare,  for example, should no longer be seen, even as an ideal,  as universally accessible entities made available through  the state, but should become available to the private consumer  with the state left, at most, to play the mopping-up role  of providing resource-constrained facilities to a much smaller  targeted community of the poorest. This is, in fact, exactly  what is happening in India and elsewhere and means that  the principle of public service is being systematically  weakened. This reality is then covered up in the name of  promoting consumer freedom of choice and convenience. Neoliberalism means a further  institutionalization of societys biases in favour of the  rich and the powerful. It means promoting greater economic  and social inequalities and then justifying this in the  name of private freedom and efficiency. In the Fifties,  Sixties and Seventies (the era when Keynesian thinking about  welfarism and developmentalism was dominant), it was considered  self-evident that such inequalities were antithetical to  preserving and deepening political democracy. In the Eighties,  Nineties and today, these inequalities have been rationalized  away as the inevitable consequence of growing freedom in  the economy and society. Neoliberalism means treating individuals  primarily as consumers and emphasizing the importance of  enhancing consumer rights and empowerment while at the same  time weakening the rights of individuals either as producers  or as citizens, since citizenship rights must be universally  accessible. This is precisely what the Supreme  Court has done through its decision. Just as there is a  growing trend in India to weaken the meaning and practice  of democracy by reinterpreting it as equivalent to majoritarianism;  just as the attack on the very principle of minority rights  (not just abuses in its application) is becoming increasingly  acceptable; similarly we are also witnessing the erosion  of the domain of citizenship and producer rights, rights  of association, protest and dissent. On the one hand, the  public sector is being systematically dismantled, reducing  the domain of public service through public provision  of goods and services. On the other hand, the limited powers  of workers who keep this domain of public provision going  are being taken away in the name of respecting public service.  Consumer empowerment, unlike citizenship empowerment, is  crucially and inescapably contingent on possession of purchasing  power, that is, money and wealth. No society that respects democracy  or wishes to make it more meaningful should justify the  erosion of citizenship rights in the name of consumer empowerment.  Nor should it forget that producers are not just private  owners of capital whose rights must be respected  indeed,  neoliberalism is all for enhancing the powers of capital  vis  vis labour. But workers are also key producers.  In most societies including ours, the powers of labour with  respect to employers, be they the state or private, are  so limited that the only real power they have to defend  their interests is the negative one of strike. Capital,  by contrast, has far more powers, including its ability  to cause public inconvenience and suffering by carrying  out investment strikes (denying output and employment). A strike is a withdrawal of ones  productive input in order to change prevailing working conditions.  When private employers refuse to invest unless conditions  are favourable, the response of governments and the media  is not to criticize or condemn them, let alone to deny them  this capacity, but to bend over backwards to give them what  they want. And this even though employers have so many other  powers  to hire and fire, decide production runs and content,  shift facilities, and so on. As for the state behaving as  employer, public investment, it is declared in these neoliberal  times, must be reduced in favour of private investment,  for the good of the public. But neoliberalism alone is not  the full explanation. It is the marriage of this neoliberalism  with the peculiarities of the Indian polity that explains  why, apart from India, no genuinely democratic society anywhere  in the world has gone so far, or ever even threatened to  go so far, in issuing a blanket legal denial of this kind.  Not even the most conservative of governments or judiciaries  in the United States of America and the United Kingdom would  contemplate taking such a step.  India is the one example of a  stable and enduring democracy that emerged in an overwhelmingly  agrarian society and not after a substantial process of  industrialization in which much of the public became workers,  got organized, and through that very process fought for  and succeeded in getting fundamental rights institutionalized  for ordinary working people, be these the right to vote  or those of organization, protest and dissent. In those  societies, the historical, emotional and ideological connections  between respect for workers rights and respect for democracy  are much deeper than in India. Here, given the relative  historical weakness of the labour movement since independence,  there has always existed a tripartite relationship among  capital, labour and the state (including its legal apparatus)  in which the state is the most powerful entity and held  crucial mediating ground. As long as state managers and  the ideology of the Indian elite remained progressive and  welfarist, it could both promote the interests of capital  and yet insist on a degree of real democratic and legal  protection of workers and citizens rights. Once this elite  and those who manage the state apparatuses have become prisoners  of the new ideology of neoliberalism, it becomes all the  more easy to do what cannot be done in other democracies.  What can one say about the state of Indian democracy when  both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress, the two  largest parties, each with strong and organized labour constituencies,  have been so wishy-washy and mealy-mouthed in their response  to the Supreme Court judgment?

 Anuradha Kumar																								The Bharatiya Janata Partys landslide win by a margin of 120 seats in Rajasthan surprised even its most ardent supporters. The portents were evident as early as last years by-elections in three assembly constituencies. The present election campaign, waged on a multi-pronged strategy focussing on basic needs and an adroit management of the complex social equation in the state, produced the winning formula. 																								Most important was the way the party managed to woo a greater cross-section of castes in a strictly polarized state. The politics of pleasing caste groups began when the Ashok Gehlot government recommended 14 per cent reservation for upper castes. While this echoed demands made three years back by the Social Justice Front, it considerably alarmed the substantial Jat community. 																								For its part, the BJPs projection of Vasundhara Raje as chief minister in a state with a strong caste and male bias would have been counterproductive. But Raje presented herself as a Rajput daughter, Jat daughter-in-law and Gujjar mother-in-law. Through her, women found a voice to support, and a candidate who would work for them. This election witnessed the highest ever turnout of women voters.  Right moves																								The BJP could also present itself as a contrast to the disarray and complacency in the Congress. In July, the party chose to ignore the findings of an all India Congress committee survey that predicted tough-going for the party. It had to pay the price. Nearly 80 per cent of Gehlots ministers lost the elections. Government employees unions, alienated following the governments tough stance during the 1999-2000 strike, also voted against the party. The Gehlot government reduced retirement age, stopped bonus payments, and stalled fresh recruitment. 																								As the results reveal, the BJP made major headway in traditional Congress bastions, including adivasi-dominated regions. Although it won 26 of the 33 scheduled caste seats, this does not really indicate a surge in Dalit support for the BJP. Unlike adivasis, Dalits make up smaller numbers in the villages they live in. But, since Gehlot had cited the creation of 70 lakh labour days as a major achievement of his drought management programme, it came as a blow to the Congress. 																								Rajput and Brahmin voters remained loyal to the BJP. The surprise was in the Jat drift towards the BJP. The party had begun to woo them prior to the 1999 general elections, when the Vajpayee government agreed to the castes longstanding demand for reservations in government jobs and educational institutions in the other backward classes section.  Turn of the tide																								The Congress base among the adivasis was also eroded for many reasons. Vishwa Hindu Parishad activists campaigned for the BJP, holding trishul diksha programmes in southern Rajasthan, especially in constituencies bordering Gujarat. Saffron workers from Gujarat were also roped in. The community liaison groups appointed by the Gehlot government in these districts to maintain communal amity hardly had an impact. In Jaisalmer and Bikaner, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh made inroads with its Seema Jan Kalyan Samiti which set up adarsh vidyalayas to counter madrassahs. 																								A vote against the Congress, however, did not necessarily translate into one for the BJP. Despite the thumping victory, the BJPs share of votes only increased from 33.23 per cent to 38.4 per cent. The Congresss vote share declined more steeply from 44.95 per cent to 34.9 per cent. The missing votes went to smaller parties like the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Indian National Lok Dal, and the Nationalist Congress Party. In 28 constituencies, the BJP managed to win by a margin of less than 3,000 votes. The BJP win in the three adivasi constituencies  Sagwara, Sapotara and Toda Bhim was equally narrow. Unless Raje consolidates her position quickly, the trend in the BJPs favour could change by the time of the general elections.

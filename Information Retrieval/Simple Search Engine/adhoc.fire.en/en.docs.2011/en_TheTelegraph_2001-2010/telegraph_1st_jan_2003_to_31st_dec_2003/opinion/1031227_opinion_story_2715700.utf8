		 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 THE RIGHTEOUS WARRIOR
 This Above All / Khushwant  Singh				 	 Crowds at the Golden Temple on Guru Gobind Singhs birth anniversary																								Owing to the vagaries of the Vikrami calendar, there are years when Guru Gobind Singhs birthday comes twice. This year it will be celebrated on December 29. It is unfortunate that Guru Gobind Singh has been projected only as a warrior who founded the militant fraternity of the Khalsa Panth in 1699 AD. 																								He was much more than simply the man who waged a losing battle against heavy odds, lost all his four sons in the struggle and yet remained in buoyant spirits with the conviction that ultimately he would win because he was engaged in dharamyudh, battle for the sake of righteousness. 																								He spelt out his creed in the numerous verses he composed in Braj, Hindi, Punjabi and Persian. It is hard to believe that in the short span of his life of 32 years (1666-1708) he could cram in so much activity: besides making the final recension of the holy Granth (he did not include any of his own compositions in it), he organized an entire community and left a sizeable corpus of his own writings, compiled later in the Dasam Granth.																								Guru Gobind Singh was categorical in stating that he did not believe in divisions based on religious differences: maanas kee jaat sab ek hee pehchan bo  know all mankind as of one caste, he wrote: 																								Kon bheo mundia sanyasi																								One man by shaving his head																								Hopes to sets up as a yogi																								Or some other kind of ascetic.																								Some call themselves Hindus																								Others call themselves Mussalmans And yet man is of one race all  over the world;																								God as Creator, and God as Good God in his Bounty and God in His  Mercy																								Is all one God. Even in our errors																								We must not separate God from God!																								Worship the one God.																								For all men the One Divine Teacher.																								All men have the same Form.																								All men have the same Soul.																								His notion of dharamayudh was taken from the Gita: once you are convinced your cause is just, fight for it to your last breath without bothering about loss or gain, victory or defeat. But only take to arms when all other means of arriving at a peaceful settlement have failed.																								He summed up his belief in life and its aftermath in a few lines written in the praise of the timeless god, Akal Ustat.																								As sparks flying out of flame Fall back on the fire from which  they rise; As dust rising from the earth  Falls back upon the same earth; As waves beating upon the shingle																								Recede, and in the ocean mingle So from God come all things under  the sun And to God return when their race  is done.																								Of his many poems, one of the most moving was composed in a mood of despair when he felt all was lost. Nevertheless, he re-affirmed his faith in god: Mitter Piyare noon, hall mureedan  da kehnan Beloved Friend, beloved God, Thou  must hear The servants plight: when thou  art not near																								The comforts cloak is a pall of pest, The home is like a serpents nest; The wine chokes like a hangmans  noose, The rim of the goblet is an assassins  knife. With Thee shall I in adversity  dwell,																								Without Thee life in ease is life in hell. When death comes knocking																								I have written so much about death and dying in recent months that the contagion has spread to my readers. The following poem written by a young doctor, Amrinder Bajaj, full of the zest for life, came as a gloomy surprise:																								In flowing black robes																								And ash white face																								Death came to me																								In a dream one night																								And said,																								Ive come to grant a boon.																								Incredulous, I asked,																								You who are the end of all ends,																								The one thing that																								Saints and sinners fear alike.																								The one name that evokes																								Terror and dread;																								Do you have it in you																								To give me something good?																								Certainly, replied the ghostly one,																								I may be the final visitor in each life																								But of you, the chosen one, I ask																								Should I come in youth or age,																								With pain or with serenity?																								Should I take you bit by bit																								Or in one fell sweep?																								Should I bring the twin sisters																								Sorrow and suffering along																								Or come alone as a welcome guest?																								So you see I have much to offer																								And to you alone I offer a choice. Wisdom, in a nutshell																								Discovered written on a Mitsubishi Lancer in Mumbai: Love your enemy  itll drive him nuts!																								Sticker on a Tata Indica seen in Pune  Advice  Dont go through life pushing doors marked Pull!																								Seen written on a wall inside a college campus: If at first you dont succeed, youre just like 99.99 per cent of the population!																								(Courtesy: S. Shekhar, Mumbai) What you sow...																								Santa got married a day before his birthday and went on a honeymoon. In the middle of the night the telephone rang. It was his mother wishing him a happy birthday. Somewhat peeved, he thanked her but asked why she had disturbed him at three in the morning. Well son, you too disturbed me at three in the morning twenty-six years ago, she replied sweetly.																								(Contributed by Anirban Sen, New Delhi)

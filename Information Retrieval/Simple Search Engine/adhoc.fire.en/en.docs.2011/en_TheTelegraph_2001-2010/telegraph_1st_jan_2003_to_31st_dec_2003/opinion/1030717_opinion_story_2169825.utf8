 															- DOCUMENT Extracts from the UNDPs 2003 report  on Development Against HIV/AIDS in South East Asia 				 	 From vision to action																								Some important results are presented for illustration under the four headings of the project model (United Nations Development Programme-South East Asia HIV project model), but are in fact interrelated. This means that results under one heading are dependent to some extent on progress under the other headings.																								Creating an enabling policy environment: at the macro inter-country ASEAN level, the project has played a key role, incorporating the results of the project and facilitating the signing of a memorandum of understanding towards the end of 2000 which will enable provincial authorities to work directly together to deal with internal and international population movements. For example, the MOU will help the countries carry out joint action programmes in the area of mobility.																								Furthermore, the project, through its technical assistance in the area of mobility to the countries, enabled them to submit to ASEAN, for its endorsement, common policies and joint programmes on mobility, development and HIV.																								Policy developments: the Chiang Rai workshop joint action framework and specific recommendation on including in construction projects HIV prevention strategies have been endorsed by the ASEAN task force on AIDS which has led to cluster consultations between the two clusters of countries... It is expected that the ATFOA will again endorse these results and submit them to the ASEAN heads of state summit for endorsement at their 2001 Brunei meeting. 																								These developments also include a human rights dimension. Meanwhile, in the land transport sector, HIV/AIDS has been going through the UN mechanisms with project policy advocacy and has led to a land transport sector preventive policy and strategy. This has already been discussed by the Laos ministry of transport which is expanding it from land to all forms of transport in the country. Guangxi province in China...and Vietnam are planning to follow suit. In addition, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam are in the process of including the ministries of transport, infrastructure and construction in their national AIDS committee.																								Knowledge base building and transfer: by bringing together, at critical stages in the project, experts and national decision-makers, conceptual advances and their translation into operational terms have been possible, thus building a development centred paradigm. For example, through this project there has been a shift from the health paradigm to a development centred one which has led to expanding interventions from individuals or group behaviour, eg. migrants, to a systems approach...																								Response mechanisms such as the early warning and rapid response system are being developed by the project at the stage of vulnerability detection rather than reacting to prevalence trends. Through the projects hub model, the urgent need for regional responses complementing national ones has been identified. These developments are being transferred by the project to the transport sector for action.																								Methodologies and strategies: mapping assessments of roads and related risks of HIV have provided new tools for interventions and advocacy. For example, the UN theme group in China adopted the methodology to study mobile populations and devise programmes: the first activities are being implemented in Hunan province, the main sending province of migrant workers. Myanmar, although not officially signed on to the project, is planning to apply the assessment methodology to a nation-wide study of mobile populations and HIV...																								It also used the results in its approval process for international projects. The EWRRS is a new strategy integrating observation, detection and alert right through to development centred responses. The hub model can also be expected to be fruitful in these areas by preventing the connection of epidemics.																								As shown, the project started in early 1999 and now, at mid point, has achieved a number of results both in knowledge-base and in policy. The model shows that this is a continuing process, and, as the policy environment and knowledge progress, the results and interventions will also evolve.																								Implementation and expansion: the project is developing along three axes: sector, issue and geographic expansion; UNDP internal advocacy; UN system policy development... CONCLUDED

		 Monday, October 13, 2003  AMERICAN DREAMS AND FRENCH NIGHTMARES
 Jacques Chiracs warning tones are  any day better than Thomas L. Friedmans biased analysis,  for America has, after all, failed in Iraq, writes Bhaskar  Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting Time to go home?  I used to think that Thomas L.  Friedman, probably the best-known foreign affairs commentator  in the American press, was a reasonably balanced analyst  till I read his articles on Iraq. True, he had in the past  advocated removing Saddam Hussein by means other than violence,  but once George W. Bush attacked Iraq, he took it for granted  that it was inevitable and that what was really important  was to move carefully after the war to develop Iraq. Even this one was read and passed  over; very few Americans, it seemed, could have really been  able to stand back and see the appalling nature of their  countrys unprovoked attack on a much weaker country, the  thousands of men, women and children they killed in the  process and the terrible destruction that they caused with  their laser-guided bombs and cruise missiles. But many in  other countries did, and one of the most vocal in their  criticism has been France. France has opposed the attack  right from the start and maintained its opposition to it  while the butchery went on. Now that counter attacks have  started, and American troops are being killed on an almost  regular basis, theyre beside themselves with rage and impotent  fury, venting their hate on innocent people. Consider this;  Indian forces in Kashmir suffer casualties all the time,  but they never let this affect their mission  to unearth  and eliminate terrorists. If a civilian is killed it is  an accident, certainly not a result of blind rage and hysterical  firing. In fact, one will find that terrorists have killed  more civilians that the security forces. But not in Iraq, where the Americans  have been victorious as they tell each other; not in a  country theyve conquered. For one thing its not their  country, and they dont give a damn about the local people,  and, for another, they are, when faced with a truly dangerous  situation, frightened, hysterical and virtually out of control.  France is one country that foresaw what would happen; its  president, Jacques Chirac, said as much in an interview  he gave to The New York Times on September 22. Chiracs  experience as a lieutenant in the French army during Algerias  war for independence proved to him how a vast and powerful  army could be defeated by a small group of determined adversaries  convinced of their right to run their own country. Chirac  was quoted as saying, We know from experience that imposing  a law on people from the outside hasnt worked for a long  time. It was this awareness that was  clearly what prompted the French president to lay out a  two-stage plan for Iraqi self-rule, the first being the  symbolic transfer of sovereignty from American hands to  the existing 25-member Iraqi governing council, followed  by a gradual ceding of real power over a period of six to  nine months.  But this is what the redoubtable  Pulitzer prize winning analyst, Thomas Friedman, says about  a similar formulation proposed by the French foreign minister,  Dominique de Villepin. Its time we Americans, says Friedman,  came to terms with something: France is not just our annoying  ally. It is not just our jealous rival. France is becoming  our enemy. He offers as evidence three instances of how  France behaved recently. (Behaved, indeed. Just what does  he think that country is, a servant who needs to be disciplined?)  Then he says, France wants America to fail in Iraq.  This has got to be the most fatuous  and amusing statement of the season. Why its fatuous is  obvious, but the reason for its being amusing is that, whatever  France may or may not want, America has failed in Iraq.  Why else are Colin Powell, Christina Rocca and others scurrying  about trying to get other countries to send troops to Iraq,  so that American soldiers can withdraw? It has failed to  govern a country because it has never been a colonial power.  France has, and Frances record as a colonial power is not  a very savoury one, But when Jacques Chirac says that he  realized in Algeria that even a powerful army could not  stand up to a determined group of local fighters who want  to run their own country, even a reasonably intelligent  person would place great store by it. The French have never  liked giving up power; even today they try to intervene  when civil strife occurs in one of their former colonies.  And if their president says that in such situations its  wiser to get out, then hes not saying it to spite the Americans.  Hes saying it because hes learnt it at the cost of French  lives.  But neither the American government  nor such highly regarded commentators such as Friedman seem  to see this. The Bush administration has ruled out any plan  to strip the American administrator of Iraq, L. Paul Bremer  III, of his power, ostensibly because a hasty transition  (of power) to the Iraqis would be counterproductive and  dangerous. Doesnt this sound familiar to those of us whore  old enough to remember British colonial attitudes? Didnt  Churchill say that Indians werent ready to rule themselves?  That if they were given independence they would descend  into chaos within ten years?  Friedman also, not surprisingly  says just that. What I have no doubts about is that there  is no coherent, legitimate Iraqi authority able to assume  power in the near term. So America must continue its brazenly  illegal and immoral rule of that wretched country, because  Friedman feels that France wants America to sink in a quagmire  there in the crazy hope that a weakened US will pave the  way for France to assume its rightful place as Americas  equal, if not superior, in shaping world affairs. How paranoid  can one get? And consider these wild, mindless  reactions both by the Bush aministration and analysts like  Friedman, against the reasoned stand taken by the French  president. Doesnt anyone in the Bush government and so-called  Middle East experts like Friedman think of looking just  a little to the west of Iraq and see whats happening in  Israel and Palestine, basically because of religion? If  Chirac can, why cant they?  The fact is the Americans simply  cant stand being told theyre wrong by someone else. If  someone says that, then he must be evil and an America-hater.  They can be told theyre wrong if an American says so; then  they accept it. It was, remember, only after Walter Cronkite  went to Vietnam and found out that it wasnt a great wild  west adventure that was going on there, that he said in  one of his television reports that it was time the Americans  left Vietnam. He said, if I remember correctly, We need  to tell our Vietnamese allies weve done the best we could  but its time for us to go home. Cronkite was a shrewd  and perceptive journalist; not given to the rather wild  statements Friedman has started making. His advice was eventually  acted on, as unrest grew in the US; Lyndon Johnson is supposed  to have said that Cronkites remarks cost him his election  as president. Finally what will speak for themselves  will be the facts. The fact that American soldiers are dying  every day; the fact that the American administration hasnt  succeeded in getting law and order back to Iraq; the fact  that no country wants to send troops there unless, as India  put it, the Iraqis want it. The alternative is the equivalent  of those haunting images Thomas Friedman must have seen   of helicopters evacuating people from the roof of the  American embassy in Saigon, with terrified people scrambling  to board them even as they took off.

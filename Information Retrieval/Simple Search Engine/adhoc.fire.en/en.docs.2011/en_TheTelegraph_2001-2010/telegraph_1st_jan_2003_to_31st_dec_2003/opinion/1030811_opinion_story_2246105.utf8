 - One serious casualty of modern medical practice is the family  doctor  Commentarao / S.L.Rao The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission  raoslhotmail.com In my childhood in Bombay in the  Forties every middle-class family had a family doctor. His  (sometimes her) knowledge about the family covered everyone  in it, visitors and relatives. The doctor was an intimate  part of the family and knew everything about it, salary  increases, promotions, examination marks of the children  and so on. While doctors bills were to be settled every  month, in many cases like mine, a family with many small  children could not settle for months though the fees were  small even by the standards of those days. The doctors  response was invariably sympathetic and understanding. Bills  were always settled, mostly by installment much after they  were due. There was a compounder, (a pharmacist) who ground  and mixed the medications prescribed by the doctor. This  made the medicines very low in cost. Very rarely and in  the most complex and stubborn cases would the doctor call  for pathology, X-rays and other such expensive aids to diagnosis.  These doctors had an encyclopedic recall of their patients  medical history. In one clinical session of possibly five  hours (300 minutes) these doctors might see as many as 150  patients. Each patient would wait for long to get to see  the doctor but came out satisfied and with renewed faith  in his family doctor. Fifty years later I remained my child  to our still-living family doctor of my childhood. Family  doctors (like schoolteachers) never forgot their patients. All this is in stark contrast  to the situation today. There are hardly any general practitioners,  except in some remote towns and villages and slum areas.  Those that are there are dedicated, hardworking and very  considerate of the fees that they charge their poorly off  patients. But it is the rare urban doctor who charges less  than Rs 50 for a call, many times Rs 150. Indeed, recently  one such general practitioner charged Rs 600 for a call  in a five-star hotel room.  There are no general practitioners,  only medically trained people, most of whom do not remember  their patients from visit to visit. Medical practice has  changed dramatically. There are much fewer general physicians.  Medical education is expensive and the capital costs of  becoming a doctor and then setting up private practice are  very high. Increasingly it is paid for by borrowings. Just  amortizing those costs over the patients seen over the years,  results in high fees and for many patients to be seen.  The widespread availability of  diagnostic tools (pathological laboratories) and equipment  (like ultra-sound, CAT-scan, and so on) is a boon for speedy  and good diagnosis. In many cases they are also crutches,  as doctors use them to bolster their inability to diagnose  from experience or to demonstrate their thoroughness to  patients. Their financing is also usually based on borrowings.  Hence the attempt is to maximize utilization of equipment.  Patients are sent for tests that are not strictly necessary.  The suspicion is widespread that many medical practitioners  have a nexus with such diagnostic suppliers and get a cut  for each patient they send for investigation.  Unfortunately there is no independent  regulator who will investigate such situations. No doctor  will blow the whistle on his colleague who indulges in such  practices. The self-regulatory body that is supposed to  do so has usually been hands-off regarding such complaints.  In any case since patients cannot get other doctors who  are willing to stand up and give evidence, they rarely complain. The pharmaceutical industry has  also grown at a tremendous pace. In India it is highly competitive.  The large number of licensed manufacturers results in some  of them producing imitations of popular drugs or fakes that  look alike but are very inferior to the real thing. Such  drugs kill sick people or jeopardize their recovery. But  even genuine manufacturers are said to corrupt the medical  practitioner. To fight competition, many give rewards and  incentives in cash and in kind to the practitioner who is  a large prescriber of the companys products. Clearly this  might lead the doctor to excessive prescription of such  drugs. In order to maximize earnings many doctors probably  continue with the same medication long after it ceases to  be needed. The vast variety of drugs available,  the combinations of different drugs and the large number  of manufacturers of the same drug, lead to medical practitioners  being largely ignorant about drug compositions, effects  of ingredients, the dangers lurking behind each combination  drug used by the patient and of drug interactions. Most  get their information about old and new drugs from the medical  company salesman and the literature that he distributes.  This is a poor basis for prescribing drugs to patients since  the medical salesman is no expert but is trained in the  essential and positive features of the product that he is  propagating. The medical literature that he leaves with  the doctor is largely propaganda, not learning. Despite these weaknesses in health  care delivery and the commitment of the medical practitioner,  life expectancy of children, pregnant women, lactating mothers  and other adults have improved considerably. It is difficult  to apportion the credit between clinical health care by  nurses, doctors, nursing homes and hospitals and improved  public health (safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene,  for example garbage clearance, immunization of infants against  the most common diseases, special dietary supplements for  pregnant and lactating mothers, hot mid-day meals at schools  for children, special programmes to fight malaria, small-pox,  polio, tuberculosis and the like). The likelihood is that  it is the improvement in public health that has played a  more central role. There is no doubt that the clinician  today has many more tools, techniques and drugs to deal  with his patients diseases. It is likely that many practitioners  are not very good at interpreting the results of such investigations.  When they are, they might be treating the properly identified  disease with too many powerful drugs in combination, leaving  the patient worse off than when he began treatment. We must  look for ways in which he can relate more to his patient,  as he used to in past years.  Patients could be tied to specific  doctors. Thus there would be a central point that knows  the patient and his history of illness and can monitor all  that is being done to improve his condition. Large numbers  of past records to be carried by the patient from visit  to visit may not be enough to familiarize doctors. They  are unlikely to study all the papers patiently and absorb  the information for meaningful conclusions. On the other  hand, the doctor with a small tied group of patients is  in a better position to remember the patients history. We must reinvent the institution  of the family doctor in some way. One way is to give him  a machine tie-up. The family doctor is essential for good  medical practice and sound doctor-patient relationships.  The growth of commercial hospitals and private nursing and  diagnostic centres is increasingly making medical practice  mercenary, cut off from emotional bonding with patients,  reducing coordination of patient treatment by different  specialties while making treatment expensive and soulless.  We have to find a more acceptable way.  This will require fundamental  institutional reform of regulation of the medical profession,  the pharmaceutical industry and the many other players in  health care. Unfortunately, health care has enormous vested  interests supporting these players, and policy-makers try  to get out of the sector because it does not give the visibility  that other sectors do.

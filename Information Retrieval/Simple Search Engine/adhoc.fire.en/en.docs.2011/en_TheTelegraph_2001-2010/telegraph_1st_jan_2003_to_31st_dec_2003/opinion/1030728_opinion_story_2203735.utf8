		 Monday, July 28, 2003  FREEDOM TO GROW
 Hong Kongs service sector-based economy  will be hit hard if a law is passed to curb the free flow  of information in the city, writes Zhiwu Chen The author is professor of finance  at the Yale School of Management Intangible treasures The Hong Kong legislative council  is debating legislation that would potentially enable the  government to restrict information in the name of national  security. The basis for this legislation  known as Article  23  is reasonable, but its enactment could have unexpected  consequences for the citys economy. It is not surprising  that opponents of the legislation include not only professionals  but leading businessmen, because freedom of information  and the press is vital to Hong Kongs economic livelihood  and future. Unlike many of its neighbours,  including mainland China, Hong Kongs economy does not depend  on natural resources or agriculture. Usable land space is  also very limited. Relative to the limited land, Hong Kong  has a large and educated population. With over 6 million  people but no natural resources, there are two ways to grow  the economy. First, as it did from the Fifties to the Seventies,  Hong Kong could try to rebuild its manufacturing sector.  However, given the mainlands dramatic advantage in labour  and real estate costs, this direction is a dead-end. The other way to grow the economy  is to further develop the service sector, which made up  86 per cent of Hong Kongs gross domestic product last year.  Since Hong Kong cannot compete with the mainland in agriculture  or mining and manufacturing, future economic growth will  have to come from the service sector, including financial  and educational services and healthcare. But the citys  dense population alone cannot provide its competitive advantage  in these areas, because there are many more people on the  mainland and in nearby India and Indonesia. Thus, human  capital per se cannot be Hong Kongs best asset. We are then left with institutional  capital: Hong Kongs rule of law, press freedom and economically  non-interventionist government. These intangible institutions  and traditions are the best capital of Hong Kong, and their  protection is essential to ensuring the territorys continued  economic vitality. To understand the importance of  the rule of law and freedom of information to a service  sector economy, its necessary to compare manufacturing  and financial transactions. In auto manufacturing, for example,  what you make and trade is a tangible item. A car buyer  can look at the design style and colours, can open the trunk  and even the engine to inspect the quality, and can do test-drives.  Because of this, the manufacturer and the buyer have access  to much of the same information. And the buyer may never  need to open the informational brochures provided by the  seller, because inspecting and test-driving may be sufficient.  Of course, legal enforcement of product liability helps  keep car sellers accountable and truthful. But, in the absence  of reliable legal recourse, car buyers may still be able  to make informed purchases  as long as they inspect and  test the cars well. The informational advantage that  comes with a tangible product explains why even countries  with no rule of law or free press can grow their economies  by engaging in the manufacture of goods. Some Asian countries  of the Seventies and Eighties and China today are outstanding  examples. In contrast, what is traded in  a securities transaction (say, a stock) is a financial contract  written on a piece of paper or recorded electronically.  It is a claim on future cash flow. This claim may not be  worth much if it is not backed by an investor-friendly securities  law and an independent, effective judiciary. In addition,  precisely because of the intangible nature of a financial  security, a stock buyer is at a severe informational disadvantage:  the security being traded has no colour, no style, no weight  and no flavour; nor can the buyer test-drive it. The buyer  has to rely on the information disclosed by the seller,  in order to make a judgment on the value of the security.  If the transaction takes place in a market economy where  the flow of information is not free, he will then have to  buy stocks essentially on faith  without knowing whether  the information that he relies on is false or biased. Since the rule of law and press  freedom are highly correlated for each country, to understand  the dynamics of an economy like Hong Kongs we can look  at the relationship between press freedom and service-sector  development. Based on the 1990 press-freedom ratings of  106 countries by Freedom House, one finds that a countrys  press-freedom and its service sectors development (as measured  by the service sectors share in GDP) are highly correlated:  the more free a countrys media in 1990, the better developed  its service sector in 2002. The average service sectors  share in GDP is 62 per cent for free-press countries, 57  per cent for countries with average press freedom, and 49  per cent for countries with the least free press. Given the strong correlation between  the two, does the free flow of information cause the service  sector to develop better, or does the service sectors development  lead to a more free press? Economic theory and the fact  that no country lacking rule of law or a free press has  a deep capital market suggest that the above correlation  is not a coincidence: information freedom is necessary for  the service sector to really grow. Hong Kongs economy has been enormously  successful. Its stock market is the 10th largest world-wide  and the second largest in Asia. With a total of $ 311 billion  in assets under management in 2001, Hong Kongs fund management  industry is ranked seventh globally and is also the second  largest in Asia.  Even with these achievements,  there is still room for Hong Kong to develop its financial  service industry and hence grow its economy further. For  example, at the end of 2002, there were a total of 978 stocks  listed on its two exchanges. Among these, 66 companies are  from the mainland and only 10 firms from foreign countries.  These non-Hong Kong stocks together make up slightly less  than 8 per cent of the listing total. In comparison, the  Zrich Stock Exchange has about 54 per cent of its listed  stocks from foreign countries, Amsterdam 51 per cent from  foreign countries, London 39 per cent from non-British firms,  and Paris 37 per cent from other countries. Compared to these European financial  centres, Hong Kong is too domestic and has more room to  grow. Given its service sectors maturity, it is understandable  that further growth is harder to achieve. But if Hong Kongs  market-friendly institutional infrastructure is hampered  through the pending Article 23 legislation, growth will  be not only harder but even impossible. Why would Hong Kong  give away the sort of institutions that countries like Russia,  Poland, and even China have struggled to build as they reform  their economies? As all nations in the region attempt to  broaden their appeal to the global financial community,  international investors preference for domestic press freedom  and rule of law gives Hong Kong a clear economic advantage  that should not be compromised.

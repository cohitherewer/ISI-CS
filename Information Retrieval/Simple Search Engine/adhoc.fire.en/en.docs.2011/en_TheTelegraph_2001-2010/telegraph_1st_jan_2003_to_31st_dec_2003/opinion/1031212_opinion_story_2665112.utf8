 Kaushik Roy				 	 Where are the feet of clay?																								THE ESSENTIAL WRITINGS OF JAWAHARLAL NEHRU Edited by S. Gopal and Uma Iyengar, Oxford, Rs 2,450																								Scholars may differ about their assessment of Jawaharlal Nehru, but no one can deny his impact on the countrys evolution. Sarvepalli Gopal and Uma Iyengar provide a selection of the writings of the first prime minister of India in these two massive volumes. The arrangement of the pieces is not chronological, but according to themes like foreign policy, governance, the Congress party and the like. 																								Nehru shared an enigmatic relationship with Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. At times, he felt irritated at what he called bapus illogical and irrational beliefs like Rama Rajya. In his prison notebook, Nehru writes that bapu was completely out of touch with industrialization and modernity. Nehru himself was against capitalism but he believed that industrialization would conquer the world. Nehru was especially bitter about Gandhis claim that the uplift of Harijans was more important than combating British imperialism. He was offended when Gandhi repeatedly over-ruled the Congress working committees decisions, publicly claiming that he found them unworthy after discussing the issues with his asram inmates. In frustration, Nehru wrote that after all it was only that frail old man who could move the masses with his magical power. All this strengthens the argument of some academics that Gandhi was the virtual dictator of the Congress.																								In private letters, Nehru writes of his attempts to interest Gandhi in international affairs  efforts that came to naught. In the Thirties, the Congress had two keen followers of international affairs. One was Subhas Chandra Bose, who was fascinated by Nazism, and the other was Nehru, who was attracted to socialism. Although an admirer of Lenin, he was repelled by the violence of the Soviet state in its pursuit of socialism. Nehru believed that he could have socialism in India minus the Bolshevik terror apparatus. 																								Nehru also had a romantic notion of China as a brother-in-arms in the war against Western imperialism. Unfortunately, this feeling was never reciprocated. Nehrus romantic flirtation with Beijing continued even as the Chinese armies were nearing Indias northern border. In a way, it was the rose-tinted glasses with which Nehru saw China that resulted in the 1962 disaster. The editors, however, do not include any of Nehrus speeches and writings dealing with the China disaster. 																								In recent times, Bharat Karnad has shown how the non-aligned movement was a sham. When some newly-independent Afro-Asian countries like Uganda and Indonesia, proposed the formation of a bloc under Indias leadership, Nehru threw cold water on the plan. In reality, he was only interested in engaging with great powers like China and Russia  who largely neglected India. 																								Gopal and Iyengar exclude all official documents and keep only a selection of Nehrus public speeches and writings. This, they claim, has been done to present a composite and holistic picture of the great man. This is the books principal problem  it tries to portray Nehru as a great man who never went wrong. A few policy decisions by Nehru ought to have been included to present a more realistic picture.																								One needs Sonia Gandhis permission to see Nehrus post-1947 papers  permission that is not always forthcoming. The many volumes of the Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru might confuse general readers. So one could find important markers in the two volumes of Nehrus Essential Writings, which must be essential reading for all historians and political scientists.						KAUSHIK ROY

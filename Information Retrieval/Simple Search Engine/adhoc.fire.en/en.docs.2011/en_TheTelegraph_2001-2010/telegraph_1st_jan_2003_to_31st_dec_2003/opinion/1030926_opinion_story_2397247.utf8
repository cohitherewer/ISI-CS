		 Friday, September 26, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Colonels, gigolos and a blockbusterColonel Chabert (Hesperus,   2.95) by Honore de Balzac is a story  of hauntings  the French word for ghosts, revenants,  means those who return. Balzacs novella is a first Empire  reworking of the Odysseus and Martin Guerre stories.  His colonel was thought dead on a Napoleonic battlefield,  but returns to Paris  after years in an asylum as an amnesiac   to find that everything he had left behind has moved on  without him. Colonel Chabert was written a year or  two before his best novels, Eugenie Grandet and Pre  Goriot. Reading Balzac, A.N. Wilsons foreword comments,  is not a reassuring experience. It challenges our humanism,  if we have any, but it ultimately does not destroy it. The a to z of hinduism  (Vision, Rs 190) by Bruce M. Sullivan  is a useful reference book written by an American professor  of religious studies. It is mercifully free of saffron pieties  and has stern little entries for the RSS and the VHP, although  the rather garish cover might suggest otherwise. Hinduism  is a religious tradition of remarkable diversity, the preface  declares, and no one person, however learned, could profess  to know the whole of it.Dilwale dulhania le jayenge:  the making of a blockbuster (HarperCollins, Rs 200)  by Anupama Chopra is a rather hyperbolic book  which claims that this film has changed the face of Bollywood.  There are plenty of little colour photographs with captions  like Baldev feeding pigeons in London, Raj races a plane,  Simran and Rajeshwari dance to rock and roll, Simran  asks Baldev if she can go on Eurail, Raj and Simran reunited  in the sarsaon field, Raj and Baldev bond over pigeon-feeding  sessions and The brave heart takes the bride. Adultery and other stories  (Tara, Rs 295) by Farrukh Dhondy is  a set of clever and sometimes entertaining stories about  an international set of characters  ageing poet, white  Rastafarian, Indian gigolo, cheese impresario. Dhondy likes  the epistolary mode, and his use of email gives his fiction  a predictably contemporary turn. These are stories about  love, lust, friendship, betrayal and other human vicissitudes.  This is Patsy writing to her favourite Indian gigolo, Suresh:  My dearest 007, Has anyone told you how charismatic you  look and sound when you fly off your handle? Theres no  need. OK, you need some money. I got money. Does that ever  come between friends?

		 Monday, September 01, 2003  SRINAGAR, FOUR YEARS LATER
 Suvir Kaul returns to his homeland  and finds that Kashmirs multi-religious, syncretic culture  might be impossible to restore The author is professor of English,  University of Pennsylvania Loss of an ancient  sanctity  All the calendars in our home  in Srinagar stood frozen at October 1999, which is the last  month my parents lived in their house there. We feared great  damage in the intervening years, but were relieved to find  only enormous volumes of dust, and the detritus of pigeons  nesting in the attic and the balcony, encouraged by the  easy access provided by broken window-panes. As we cleaned   the hard work being done by two neighbourhood caretakers  called Abdul Gaffar and Raghunath  it was tempting to think  of the restoration of this home as a metaphor for a restored  Srinagar, and a Kashmir, and a return to a multi-religious,  syncretic culture. That restoration, however, is  going to be much harder, and even perhaps impossible, to  achieve. The brutal history of the past fourteen years cannot  be wished away, and a people ground down under the military  might of the state and the violence of well-armed militants,  cannot but wonder at what might have been, or indeed what  the future might hold. But there are other important reasons  why the state of siege in the valley will not be lifted  soon: too many people have enriched themselves in the last  decade, and they know exactly what they will lose if the  conflict in Kashmir de- escalates.  Stories are rife of the wealth  accrued by the leaders of each political faction (and there  are many). Similar stories circulate about bureaucrats,  officers of army units and of each paramilitary force (these  too are multiple, and their acronyms  BSF, CRPF, SSB, JKP,  RR, STF  have become the new idiom of Kashmiri). People  talk at length of the money that has circulated in the valley  via each of these groups and their counterparts in  Pakistan, and of how much the politico-military elite on  both sides of the border has benefited from the state of  affairs in Kashmir. Money to be made is arguably the  most powerful local vested interest, but there is also the  heady power of this elite bull-dozing its way in elaborate  convoys past locals who have learnt to step aside or be  assaulted. Recently, the local papers described a woman  professor whose car failed to give way quickly enough being  dragged out by her hair and beaten. When officers or their  families go shopping on Residency Road or Lambert Lane,  trucks of soldiers deploy on either side, all in addition  to the forces permanently on patrol there. Local Kashmiris  have learned to ignore such activities as the antics of  a powerful elite, but for the likes of us visiting Kashmiris,  every day offered ugly instances of the ways of a superior  occupying force.  The boulevard that fringes the  Dal Lake is alive with people, but no one can take free  passage for granted, for at a moments notice the road is  blocked and civilians must detour. Perhaps most egregious  of all is the fact that local, non-upper class Kashmiris  are turned away from the springs at Chashmashahi, while  outsiders are granted access. Nowhere is the remaking of an  older Kashmir into the soulless forms of a modern India  more visible than in the paramilitary take-over (which can  also of course be styled the preservation) of the old  Hindu shrines of Kashmir. Kheer Bhawani (Tulla Mulla) and  the Shankaracharya temple that overlook Srinagar have lost  whatever ancient sanctity they once possessed. They are  now armed camps, festooned with the bright colours and signboards  so beloved of military officers. Commanding officers of  units stationed at these sites have turned them into advertisements  for themselves  now you can only get to the Devi via CRPF  yellow and red, and by walking past large tin placards that  rewrite Kashmiri belief into the vocabulary of a more mainstream  Hinduism. When we visited, bhajans that blare from  jagrans in Delhi were playing loudly  only the wonderful  old chinars suggested all that was once distinctively Kashmiri  about Tulla Mulla. A Ram Mandir is being built at  the site of the ancient sun temple at Martand (Mattan).  This is not simply an addition to what is already there   it is a deliberate refashioning of Kashmiri Hindu worship  to obey the dictates of Hindutva practice. But worst  of all are the excessive displays put on ostensibly for  the benefit of the Amarnath yatris, but which actually  function as a warning to local Kashmiris: all along the  route past Pahalgam, and to some extent on the Baltal route,  banners and wall-slogans sponsored by the CRPF and the BSF  (and occasionally, the Jammu and Kashmir police) welcome  the yatris. These units also make available tea and snacks,  and announce them as prasad. There is no constitutional  separation of temple and state to be found here  the yatris,  and those who guard them, are equally, and aggressively,  Hindu. Most surprising for the visitor,  however, is the great prosperity of Srinagar, where new  homes are ever larger and the air impressively polluted  by the thousands of cars and buses bought recently. Stores  are stocked with the goods sold in the fancy shops of south  Delhi. The handicrafts for which Kashmir has long been famous  are plentiful, and the situation in the valley has meant  that enterprising dealers have developed outlets for them  across the country. The electricity supply has improved  considerably  there are power cuts, but they operate according  to a schedule, and the voltage is no longer miserable. Outside  Srinagar, however, it is a different story. Villagers talk  of a time, twenty years ago, when they knew electricity,  and wish for doctors and teachers, who, like piped water,  are a scarce resource. But there is change in the air,  and everywhere in the valley people are celebrating their  opportunity to travel to places that they have not dared  to visit for years. An entire generation has been deprived  of civic life and of the joys of Kashmir, and they are aware  of this deprivation. Schoolchildren now flood Pahalgam and  Gulmarg, and the Mughal Gardens are full of local visitors.  No one knows how long this lull will last, with the result  that locals are moved by a near-hysterical urge to wander,  to picnic, to talk of the future.  This is a moment of hope then,  of young people wishing for a life different from that they  have suffered so far, of conversations in which plans are  made for a Kashmir in which ideas can flourish, the mind  can be without fear, and the head can be held high. I invoke  Tagores great nationalist poem deliberately, for its aspirations   as true for Kashmiris as for Indians more generally   might well be those of a group of young college students  and lecturers I met. They gather on Sundays to discuss a  life of ideas outside of the machinations of international  politics, paramilitary strategies, and the self-aggrandizement  of those who rule Kashmir. Their hope, like Tagores, is  to build a heaven of freedom into which Kashmir, and India,  might one day awake.

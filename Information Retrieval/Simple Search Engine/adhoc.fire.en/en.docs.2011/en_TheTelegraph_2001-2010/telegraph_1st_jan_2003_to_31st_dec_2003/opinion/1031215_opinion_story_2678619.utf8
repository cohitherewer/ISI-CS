		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 CHECK THE RETAIL
																								Rules are unquestionably important in the operations of both the legislature and the executive. Yet a set of written guidelines, like the proposed 97th amendment bill, can never take the place of good sense and ordinary decencies. Till 1985, when the Rajiv Gandhi government introduced statutory guidelines to check horse-trading, legislators had operated on the lofty premise of Edmund Burke that their final accountability was neither to the party nor the constituency but to their conscience. Translated into the murky climate of post-1967 politics, it meant that loyalty on the floor of the house was negotiable. Consequently, since the political class could take neither good sense nor the vagaries of conscience for granted, the anti-defection law prescribed that any violation of the party whip could be permitted if it had the blessings of at least one-third of the legislature. 																								The new guidelines did check the retail trade of members of parliament and members of legislative assembly, that had become widespread during times of political uncertainty. Yet, the law could not instil a new ethical code of political conduct. To skirt the law, legislators have wilfully courted expulsion from the party, and other defectors have chosen to simply brazen it out. If there has hardly been cases of legislators who have been disqualified for violating the anti-defection law, it is because too many of the presiding officers have been co-conspirators in the subversion process. The Indian trait of exploiting loopholes and finding grey areas has helped take the sting out of the anti-defection act. The hapless Mr Ajit Jogis bid to deprive the Bharatiya Janata Party of the fruits of victory in Chhattisgarh may have been undone by a sting operation, but the mere fact that it was set in motion suggests that the bite has gone out of the 1985 act.																								It is unlikely that the 97th amendment which emerged from the report of a parliamentary standing committee headed by Mr Pranab Mukherjee, will help remedy the situation dramatically. It is fine to stipulate that defectors cannot hold ministerial posts till they secure re-election, but the problem is with defining a defector. Logic, for example, would suggest that the entire government of Arunachal Pradesh is made up of defectors who got elected on a Congress ticket, moved house to the Arunachal Congress and finally scurried en masse into the BJP on the belief it would give them better protection. The original split was based on a combination of personal ambition and political lure, and was sanctioned by numbers. Does it correspond to the new bills idea of an ideological split  a delightfully vague term that lends itself to many innovative and expedient interpretations? Assessed by lofty Westminster standards, it does not. But seen through the prism of Arunachal Pradesh, it is completely in order. And that, in a nutshell, is the real problem of trying to force a wholesome political culture down sceptical throats. As long as there is scope for a subjective reading of the law, expediency will triumph.

		 Thursday, August 28, 2003  CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS?
 - Civilizations accommodate similar values in different combinations  ANDR BTEILLE The author is chancellor, North-Eastern  Hill University  The publication by the American  political scientist, Samuel Huntington, of a provocative  article in the journal Foreign Affairs in 1993, followed  by a book in 1996 gave wide currency to the thesis of the  clash of civilizations. There was nothing very profound  or original in the Huntington thesis, but its appearance  was timely. The Soviet Union had collapsed, and real and  imaginary fears about the extremism, fundamentalism and  terrorism widespread in the Islamic world were beginning  to be expressed by the American establishment and growing  sections of the American public. The thesis was essentially  about the clash between Western and Islamic values, but  it was dressed, rather thinly at that, in the language of  pervasive and ineluctable clashes between civilizations  having different origins and different destinations. My impression is that the thesis  about the clash of civilizations has been coldly received  in Europe. Roman Herzog, the president of the Federal Republic  of Germany, spoke repeatedly against it, and a collection  of his speeches with comments by some others was published  in 1999 under the title, Preventing the Clash of Civilizations.  At a panel discussion in Gtersloh in Germany in 1997  at which I was present, the former prime minister of the  Netherlands, Ruud Lubbers, attacked the Huntington thesis  strongly and, by Dutch standards, intemperately. Yet, Mr  Huntington will have reason to be happy because there are  strong echoes of his thesis in the current Bush doctrine  relating to Iraq, Syria and other Islamic countries. As every anthropologist knows,  the concept of civilization is a difficult and ambiguous  one, containing many snares and pitfalls. A few years ago,  when Huntington gave a talk at the Delhi School of Economics,  I put it to him that, as an anthropologist, I found the  concept of civilization a difficult one, and asked him what  his concept of it was. I was not the only one in the audience  who concluded from his response that he had not given much  thought to the idea. Nothing is easier than to talk about  the clash of civilizations if you do not have a clear concept  of civilization. A civilization is at the very  least a distinct configuration of ideas, beliefs and values.  Undoubtedly, the configurations differ from one civilization  to another. But these differences must be seen in their  proper perspective. Firstly, difference is not the same  thing as incompatibility. Secondly, there are differences  in ideas, beliefs and values not only between civilizations  but also within each civilization; there is no civilization  that does not embody a plurality of values, or is free from  antinomies, by which I mean conflicts, oppositions and tensions  among those values. And thirdly, differences in ideas, beliefs  and values must be distinguished from conflicts of interest;  conflicts of interest are often particularly acute when  groups compete to secure not different ends but the same  ones. The boundaries of civilizations,  compared to those of nation states, are porous. Even in  ancient and medieval times, human populations as well as  ideas, beliefs and values flowed across the boundaries of  civilizations. These flows have increased to such an extent  in the last two hundred years that it would be appropriate  to say that the modern world is marked by the interpenetration  of civilizations. This does not mean that all civilizations  are becoming alike. Differences among them continue to exist,  but old forms of differentiation are displaced by new ones.  The long-term trend of change in human society and culture  is towards differentiation rather than homogenization. To be sure there are ideologues  in every civilization  in America, in the Islamic world,  in India, and elsewhere  who would like to maintain closure  of the boundaries of their own civilization. They argue  that this is necessary in the interest of unity, harmony  and balance: the intrusion of alien elements into a civilization,  they say, is bound to upset its balance. But a civilization  whose constituent elements are in perfect balance with each  other is a dead civilization and not a living one. And a  civilization that cannot accommodate a variety of traditions,  seeking to maintain a jealous hold on only one single tradition,  can hardly be called a civilization. The tangled nature of the internal  and external relations within and between civilizations  is nicely brought out by the sharp differences in sentiment,  perception and opinion between the French and the Germans  on the one hand and the Americans on the other over the  American invasion of Iraq. Obviously there are differences  of political interest and strategy between the two sides,  but each side is also accusing the other of deep and inherent  moral flaws. It is not so uncommon to explain, or explain  away, differences of political interest by reverting to  ineluctable historical and cultural differences. Books and articles are being written  on anti-Europeanism in America and anti-Americanism in Europe.  In this round of the culture wars it is the Americans who  appear to have taken the initiative, but when it comes to  culture, the French know how to give back as good as they  get. A recent commentator has noted the paroxysms of sneering  Europhobia in the US media. The sneer is about the duplicity,  hypocrisy and cowardice of the Europeans, and in particular  the French, as against the manly virtues of the Americans:  as the catch phrase has it, Americans are from Mars, Europeans  are from Venus. The French intellectual, who is nothing  if not supercilious, might say that this is not a clash  of civilizations, but a clash between civilization on one  side of the Atlantic and its absence on the other. The diatribes across the Atlantic  have brought out certain interesting contrasts of cultural  orientation as well as certain interesting reversals of  contrast. The Americans are today riding the high horse  of militarism whereas there is a genuine current of pacifism  running through contemporary German society. But this contrast  between American bellicosity and German pacifism is an almost  exact reversal of the contrast between Germany and the United  States of America one may have noted between, say, 1871  and 1941. There have also been important  shifts in patterns of inequality and attitudes to it on  the two sides of the Atlantic. There is more equality and  greater concern over inequality in France and Germany than  in the US today. This would have surprised Alexis de Tocqueville,  the French aristocrat and theorist of democracy who had  argued in the first half of the 19th century that the advance  of equality was providential and that in that advance America  would lead the way and Europe would follow. America still  wants to lead the way, but not, it would appear, in the  advance of equality. It is not my argument that the  divergence between Europe and America will continue indefinitely  along the course it has taken now. There will be divergence  and re-convergence, and then perhaps divergence again. All  great civilizations recognize, acknowledge and accommodate  the same basic and fundamental human values, but in very  different combinations. Moreover, these combinations are  in a perpetual process of change. That is why one has to  approach with the utmost caution pronouncements on the clash  of civilizations, whether between Islam and the West or  between the US and France.

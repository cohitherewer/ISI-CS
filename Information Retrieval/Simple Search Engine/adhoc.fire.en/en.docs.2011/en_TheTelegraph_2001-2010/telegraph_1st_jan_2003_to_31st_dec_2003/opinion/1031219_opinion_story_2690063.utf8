 Piyus Ganguly																								The Uprooted Vine By Swarnakumari Debi, Oxford, Rs 395																								There was hardly a branch of literary writing in which Swarnakumari Debi, the elder sister of Rabindranath Tagore, did not excel. No less outstanding were her contributions to music and journalism. Besides, she was actively associated with the social and political movements of her times. As such, the social novel  the volume under review is one  became her forte. These novels served as valuable documents of social history of 19th century Bengal. They provide a graphic account of life within the inner apartments of middle-class homes.																								Swarnakumari Debi focusses on the abject lot of women, as they happen to be the worst victims of an unjust social system. In their introduction to the novel the translators, Rajul Sogani and Indira Gupta, point out that the author took up the cause of the victims of the Hindu patriarchal system, daughters, daughters-in-law, widows and poor dependents in the joint family who were deprived of their rights, exploited and marginalized to the extent of being denied shelter and maintenance.																								The plot of the novel revolves around the sufferings of Snehalata, an orphan and child widow, who is ultimately driven to suicide by the callous, tyrannical behaviour of her own family and that of her husband. Another widow, Jibans mother, is thrown out of the joint family so that she cannot lay a claim on the inheritance. Snehalatas sister-in-law, Kamala, another victim of injustice and neglect, dies young. But the author also lays bare the complicity of other women in backing patriarchy and using it to torture the weaker members of their own sex. A glaring example of such repression is Snehalata herself.																								Swarnakumari Debi shows up the hypocrisy and weakness of the men who profess to loving Snehalata, but fail to protect her and provide her with justice. She receives a raw deal from such well-wishers when she is most in need of help and sympathy. Jagatbabu, Charu and Kishori are painted in lurid colours as the representatives of the patriarchal society. All the characters, male and female, are drawn with a great deal of sensitivity.																								Swarnakumari Debis social novels form a bridge between the novels of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and Rabindranath Tagore. The latters Chokher Bali deals with widow marriage. The translators note that she shared with Bankim Chandra a keen interest in history, an ironic vision which enabled him to expose the gap between ideals and practice or between expectations and consequences. The influence of Bankim is reflected in the style and structure of The Uprooted Vine which has several resembles with Chatterjees Bishbriksha (1872)  the story of a child widow, Kundanandini, whose love for Nagendranath, not approved by society, leads her to suicide. While Chatterjee was a moralist who frowned upon sexuality and independent enterprise in widows, Swarnakumari in her novel came down heavily upon male domination and conventional morality. He answer to the problem of women like Snehalata was not necessarily re-marriage, but education and financial independence, which would enable them to live with dignity. Contemporary readers might question why Swarnakumari Debi does not allow her protagonist to rise against her oppressors instead of taking her own life.																								An easy yet competent translation makes the novel eminently readable.						PIYUS GANGULY

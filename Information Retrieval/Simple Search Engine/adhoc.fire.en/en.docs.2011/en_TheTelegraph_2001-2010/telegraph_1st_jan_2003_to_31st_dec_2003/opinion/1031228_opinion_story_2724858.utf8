The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, December 28, 2003  DIARY
				 																																																																														 The resident of 10 Janpath seems to be progressing steadily from the frying pan to the fire. Within a fortnight of the news of the drubbing at the hustings came the acquittal of the once famous insider, PV Narasimha Rao, in the Lakhubhai Pathak case. So what? Nothing much, except that it immediately started off a poisonous whisper campaign in Congress circles. Given that Rao is now free of legal hassles, he is supposed to have suddenly emerged as a symbolic rallying point for all those who bear a grudge against madam. Notable among the disgruntled are JB Patnaik, SB Chavan, K Karunakaran, NKP Salve, Vasant Sathe, Jagdish Tytler, Jaffer Sharief, Bhajan Lal and, if the same gang is to be believed, Sharad Pawar and VC Shukla as well. Sonia loyalists have immediately gone on red alert (or is it green?), also forcing madam to react. Sonia is supposed to have paid Rao a surprise visit, ostensibly to congratulate him for the acquital, but actually to read his mind. One wonders what they made of each others pouts and bored expressions!				 																																																																														 When the winner takes all, what does the loser do? He takes a walk. That is what Digvijay Singh seems to be doing these days. Every morning, Singh reportedly goes out for long walks along the lake in Bhopal. But the exercise is turning out to be a bother for other morning-walkers. For Singh invariably flings a question at the passerby: Han bhai, to phir ab aapke yahan bijli aa rahi hai? Sadak theek ho gayee? (So brother, are you getting electricity now? Have the roads improved?) Quite obviously, Diggy Raja is making no bones about his anger and frustration at having been so unceremoniously dumped. Meanwhile, Singh is determined not to accept any official position from the party. Which means more trouble for the early-risers.				 																																																																														 As luck would have it, Diggys bte noire has also developed a love for fresh air. Apart from the makeshift temple at her residence and changes done to her office in strict concurrence with vaastu, Uma Bharti is supposed to have instructed officials to ensure that she has lush green environs and plenty of fresh air. Diggy, cry foul!				 																																																																														 Despite the hard work, Najma Heptullah may have burnt her fingers quite badly after all. The vice-chairperson of the Rajya Sabha will, seemingly, not get her much sought after nomination to the Rajya Sabha, and that is not only because of the ugly spat with Kapil Sibal in the house. It is because of AB Vajpayees shrewd moves. Sonia Gandhi, it is widely known, is thoroughly opposed to Najma getting a fourth six-year term in a row in the upper house. Vajpayee, it is said, would never take the trouble to incur the hostility of madam for someone like Heptullah who apparently, cannot swing even a single Muslim vote in Mumbais Bhindi Bazaar. Denying Najma her cake is only a small price to pay to keep the leader of the opposition in good humour. Good thinking!				 																																																																														 It does pay to keep politicos happy, especially if it is someone like Bal Thackeray. The chairman-cum-managing director of BHEL, KG Ramachandran, was apparently asked by the heavy industries ministry to pay a visit to Thackeray. A man of principles, Ramachandran found no reason why he should. The indiscretion cost the man, who single-handedly turned BHEL around, his job. Despite the unanimous recommendation of the public enterprises selection board for an extension and the endorsement of the Union cabinet secretary, the appointments committee of the cabinet could not do justice to Ramachandran. Neither the PM nor his deputy thought it worth their while to incur the wrath of the tiger for an upright technocrat. Bad thinking?				 																																																																														 The dream of an anti-BJP front seems destined to die a natural death. There is serious trouble brewing within the left over allying with the Congress-backed Telengana Rashtriya Samiti in Andhra Pradesh for the forthcoming elections. While the CPI is not opposed to the TRSs demand for the formation of Telengana, the CPI(M) has serious objection to demands for smaller states. There have been appeals to the CPI(M) to bury the hatchet for this once. But given their love for dogmas, that is unlikely to happen. Or will there be a temporary amnesia?				 																																																																														 Move over Subbirami Reddy, Vivek Jolly is here. The newly elected BJP MLA from Saket throws parties as lavish as Reddys. His latest was to commend Dev Anand for the Dada Saheb Phalke award. Not to be outdone, Reddy is believed to have said, Class dekhna hai to Subbirami ki party mein aao (For class, come to my party). Touch!				 																																																																														 Another trouble spot for madam. In Raipur recently there was a very carefully designed tea party, attended by a particularly colourful man. We are talking of Ajit Jogi, who, at the party thrown by a loyalist, Dharamjit Singh, was delighted to see that as many as 19 MLAs showed up. More delightfully, he was treated like a guest of honour, a heady reminder of the days of his raj. The news of the unlawful assembly however infuriated madam, who immediately sought explanation from Vilasrao Deshmukh, the man in charge of the party in the state, and party treasurer, Motilal Vora, who is currently being projected as madams answer to Jogi in Chhattisgarh. Septuagenarian Vora was quick to respond back, claiming that almost all the 19 MLAs had turned up to just keep an eye on each other and to gauge Jogis mood. The good news was, Vora grinned at madam, Jogi was not thinking of floating a regional outfit. The problem is Vora seems a bit too cocksure about that. Does that mean Jogi has already got the first member of his own party?

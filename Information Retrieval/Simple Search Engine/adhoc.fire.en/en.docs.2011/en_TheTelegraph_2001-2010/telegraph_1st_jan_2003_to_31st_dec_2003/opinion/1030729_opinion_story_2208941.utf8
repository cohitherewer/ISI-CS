		 Tuesday, July 29, 2003 				 FOR A FULL AND CREATIVE LIFE
 															- Document  Extracts from the Human Development  Report 2003, published by the United Nations Development Programme			Different aspectsThe goals and the promotion of human development share a common motivation and reflect a vital commitment to promoting human well-being that entails dignity, freedom and equality for all people ...As articulated in the millennium declaration, the millennium development goals are benchmarks for progress towards a vision of development, peace and human rights, guided by certain fundamental values																								These include: Freedom. Men and women have the right to live their lives and raise their children in dignity, free from hunger and from the fear of violence, oppression or injustice. Democratic and participatory governance based on the will of the people best assures these rights; Equality. No individual and no nation must be denied the opportunity to benefit from development. The equal rights and opportunities of women and men must be assured; Solidarity. Global challenges must be managed in a way that distributes the costs and burdens fairly in accordance with basic principles of equity and social justice...Tolerance. Human beings must respect one another, in all their diversity of belief, culture and language. Differences within and between societies should be neither feared nor repressed, but cherished as a precious asset of humanity... Respect for nature. Prudence must be shown in the management of all living species and natural resources, in accordance with the precepts of sustainable development. Only in this way can the immeasurable riches provided to us by nature be preserved...																								Shared responsibility. Responsibility for managing worldwide economic and social development, as well as threats to international peace and security, must be shared among the nations of the world and should be exercised multilaterally. As the most universal and most representative organization in the world, the United Nations must play the central role. 																								Human development is about people, about expanding their choices to live full, creative lives with freedom and dignity. Economic growth, increased trade and investment, technological advance are all very important. But they are means, not ends. Fundamental to expanding human choices is building human capabilities: the range of things that people can be. The most basic capabilities for human development are living a long and healthy life, being educated, having a decent standard of living and enjoying political and civil freedoms to participate in the life of ones community...Though the millennium development goals contribute to these capabilities, they do not reflect all the key dimensions of human developmentand human rights.																								Achieving the goals will advance human rights ...Recognizing that the targets expressed in the goals are not just development aspirations but also claimable rights has important implications; viewing the goals in this way means that taking action to achieve them is an obligation...Human rights carry counterpart obligations on the part of others  not just to refrain from violating them, but also to protect and promote their realization ...Viewing the goals through a human rights framework increases understanding of the policies and institutional reforms required to achieve them...																								It also requires that people participate meaningfully in public decisions about education. And it requires that measures for achieving education-related goals be equitable  not disadvantaging vulnerable groups or entrenching gender discrimination. The full realization of economic, social and cultural rights requires far more than achieving the millennium development goals.  TO BE CONCLUDED

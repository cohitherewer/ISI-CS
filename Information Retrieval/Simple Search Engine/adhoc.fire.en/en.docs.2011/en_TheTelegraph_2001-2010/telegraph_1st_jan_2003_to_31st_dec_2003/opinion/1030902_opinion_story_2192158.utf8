 - The BJP will have to decide whether it wants to be a national  party  PRATAP BHANU MEHTA The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University Although the Bharatiya Janata  Party has successfully managed the National Democratic Alliance  for almost five years, it now faces some crucial existential  decisions about its alliances. In some ways, the BJPs dilemma  is a mirror image of the dilemma the Congress faces. The  Congress was a national party, whose support base has now  been considerably depleted, forcing it to look for allies.  The BJP, on the other hand, has come to power on the basis  of its ability to craft coalitions. But it will soon have  to decide whether it wants to enhance its national standing  through allies, or enhance its share of seats so that it  becomes less dependent upon allies. Will it, in other words,  be tempted to be become a national party?  Initially, many observers thought  that the imperative of seeking alliances would moderate  the BJP; it would have to ideologically compromise in order  to be politically acceptable. Therefore the NDA agenda avoided  controversial issues like Ayodhya and Kashmir. But political  circumstances have changed considerably over the last two  years. First, there are no longer any ideological taboos  in Indian politics. Most of the NDA partners made little  noise over Gujarat, and none has seriously objected to Ayodhya  being put on the political agenda. But the BJP has also  played the coalition game very well. It is now a surplus  majority coalition in Parliament, which means that the exit  of any single alliance partner is not sufficient to bring  the government down.  By gathering more and more allies,  it has diminished the power of any single member of the  NDA alliance. This is one of the reasons why NDA partners  have become less assertive now than when the coalition was  first formed. The BJP has the upper hand in bargains, and  it has become impossible for any single alliance partner  to exercise a veto on policy at the Centre. It is probably  not a coincidence that Ayodhya is back on the political  agenda, despite its absence from the NDAs common programme.  In order to block the BJP, three or four of its major alliance  partners will have to act together. But because its alliance  partners are regionally concentrated, they have few interests  in common. Coalition politics will not therefore necessarily  lead to moderation, if the party in power has surplus majority  in Parliament.  But the BJP is now pondering over  what the price of this success is going to be. The BJP has  tried the experiment to become as legitimate as any party  is in the political spectrum by trying to attract a wide  range of allies: from Dalits in the North, to the Dravidian  parties in the South. But two of its key alliances, with  the Bahujan Samaj Party (an ally till the other day) and  the Shiv Sena, are with parties that are its close competitors  in the relevant states. The BJP realized that in UP that  the BSP stands in the way of the BJPs further expansion  in the state. In fact, many have argued that in Uttar Pradesh,  the BJP-BSP alliance may even have had a detrimental effect  on the BJPs traditional support base within the state.  As the general elections approach, these contradictions  are going to surface more prominently.  E. Sridharan of the University  of Pennsylvania has pointed out in a recent paper that BJPs  alliance dilemma will also haunt it in states where it is  relatively weak. The BJPs expansion strategy in the South  has been predicated upon making slow encroachments by seeking  alliances. These alliances give the BJP a toehold in states  like Andhra Pradesh. But these alliances also limit its  long run expansion. N. Chandrababu Naidu might contemplate  giving the BJP some room in Andhra, so long as the end result  is not more than four or five seats for the BJP. But the  minute the BJP looks to expand its base, it becomes a threat  to its regional alliance partner. Hence its allies have  every reason to limit its expansion in their states. The dilemma this poses for the  BJP is this. Will the BJP be content to remain a regionally  concentrated party, capable of winning somewhere in the  region of one hundred and eighty to two hundred seats at  the maximum, or will it want to become a genuine national  party capable of reaching the two hundred and fifty mark  on its own? Until now, the BJPs base was so slim in the  South that this question was moot. But this question will  increasingly become relevant. As the action of the BJP allies  has shown, the South is not as averse to the politics of  Hindutva as we used to assume. And the BJP, in the  right circumstances, may be able to play the card of being  a relative newcomer to the South fairly effectively. The BJPs expansion will require  a major ideological, mobilizational and organizational effort.  But, if the last fifteen years were any guide, it would  be foolish to underestimate its capacities to do so. The  question is: will it want to? On the one hand, alliances  help it secure power easily; on the other, alliances limit  its future expansion. Will the BJP be ambitious and launch  an expansionary push, or will it be conservative and stick  to more or less what it has? As the BJP knows from its own  history, it is easier for it to mount a massive ideological  push if it is not in power. The best guess one can make  is that the BJP will probably be accommodating to its allies  in its bid to retain power at the Centre. But if it fails  to do so after the next election, and an alternative front  emerges, it will not only radicalize its agenda but also  seek newer and newer constituencies.  Oddly enough, losing an election  might give it just the freedom it needs to make a big push  towards being a national party. And who knows: losing the  election, if it is not a huge loss, might even be a blessing  in disguise for the BJP. We could end up with an unstable  government that strengthens the BJPs long-term credentials  to be a governing party. The BJP will be free to do what  it does best: play the politics of religious brinkmanship  and hope for an ideological expansion. And a Congress government,  if past actions are any guide, might even be tempted to  build the BJPs temple for it.  But the BJP will sooner or later  have to confront a serious question. Does it operate under  the limits set by its current geographical and social base?  Or does it have greater ambitions? If it has greater ambitions,  its allies, more than its enemies will stand in the way.  The dilemma for the BJP is that in politics you can flounder  as much by not having further ambitions as by having them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Is it better than the Real deal?				 																																																				Sir  David Beckham scored another goal off the field when he was offered the priciest commercial deal in sporting history by the German sportswear company, Adidas (Beckham for life at 100 m, August 11). While this might be good news for the pin-up boy of modern soccer, it certainly raises a few pertinent questions about the times we live in. Has the importance of Brand Beckham eclipsed the real person? With increasing globalization of sport, the image of an individual player has become more important than his sporting expertise. The value of a soccer player is now determined by his looks, lifestyle and fan following, and by his club. Manchester United decided to sell its most important player to the Spanish giants despite protests from soccer crazy Britons, including Beckhams father. But contemporary sportsmen are today pawns in the hands of their clubs, mere puppets who dance to the tune of a well-orchestrated corporate circus. The carefully constructed brand images of these superstars mask their real faces. The nightmare of commodification of sports has truly begun.

				 																Bottled menace				 																																																				Sir  The Centre for Science and Environment report on the alarming pesticide residue present in two popular brands of soft drinks in India has unveiled the dark secrets of the multinationals corporations . Chronic exposure to dissolved pesticides like DDT, lindane and its metabolites lead to health hazards like cancer, reduced immunity and nervous breakdown. According to the CSE report, Pepsi contains pesticides 36 times the limit prescribed by the European Union. The reason the multinationals have been able to circumvent international regulations is the absence of stringent laws in India to monitor the production of aerated drinks. In India, the Bureau of Indian Standards does not have any rules to regulate the process. The multinationals thereby exploit the loopholes in the law. Moreover, Indian customers blindly believe in the quality of the products offered to them by the MNCs. Hopefully, this controversy will open the eyes of both consumers and the government and pave the way for stronger laws to safeguard public health.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Stuti Agarwal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The recent allegation against soft drink giants comes as a rude shock to the consumers. There is an urgent need in India to clearly outline the quality of food products. Multinational corporations need to understand that their objective of profit maximization cannot be realized without fulfilling their responsibility to provide quality goods to consumers.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  Pesticide contamination is only one aspect of the hazard the soft drink giants pose to the people of this country (Kerala to Bengal, August 9). Since the Seventies, colas and similar other soft drinks have been regarded as an important factor behind the obesity pandemic sweeping the world that has become acute in the last three decades. Indians are more prone to obesity and its attendant health problems because of their diet and sedentary habits. Soft drinks may not have started the health problems here, but the Cola war has definitely added to it. The worst news is that the drinks now come allegedly fortified with pesticides and toxic metals. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Subhadip Pal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The expos in BBCs Radio 4 programme on the nexus between bureaucrats, politicians and business tycoons in the installation of the controversial Coca-Cola plant in Keralas Palakkad district has started a world movement (Coke stands accused of eco-poisoning, July 29). It is shocking that the Palakkad plant was certified as conforming to the highest environment management standard  ISO 14001.				 																																																				The contamination of the environment with heavy metals is caused by uncontrolled emissions from metal smelters and other industrial activities, unsafe disposal of industrial wastes, and lead in water pipes, paint and gasoline. Given the levels of corruption in India, it is not surprising how the plant got clearance from both the state and Central pollution control boards. The licence was even renewed despite opposition from the local panchayat. All plants of these MNCs should be sealed. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Mohanlal Sarkar, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  The hue and cry raised in Parliament over the multinational cola companies show that our politicians still suffer from the Cold War anti-Americanism. The government of India should have got international laboratories to vet the CSE report before banning the colas from its premises. It is even more ridiculous to find the West Bengal state government and the Calcutta corporation collecting soft drink bottles for testing. Given the state governments own disreputable health standards, the authenticity of these tests remains questionable. Since the contamination of potable water in India is high in itself, the government cannot entirely blame the MNCs for the pesticide content in the drinks. Politicians should act more responsibly and the government tread more cautiously when it comes to allegations against companies that invest substantial amounts in the country.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  In the controversy involving the cola giants, fingers have been pointed at both sides. But certain facts have been overlooked. For example, the CSE is said to have investigated just three bottles each for 12 major cola brands in Delhi and its suburbs. Is this a statistically credible number to make a public issue? 				 																																																				Another thing about the CSE. Its reports have often inconvenienced the common people of the country. Worried by the pollution caused by automobiles in Delhi, the agency had suggested compressed natural gas for a city which had no infrastructure to implement the changes. The result was serpentine queues at petrol pumps and bus stops, people travelling on top of buses and untold misery for Delhiites. Come next summer, Indians are going to feel the real heat of the CSE report. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Amit Kapur, New Haven, US

				 																																																				Sir  The whole country is up in arms against the cola multinationals. West Bengals minister in charge of environmental and pollution control sounds particularly bothered about the health standards of the population. Yet it is difficult to understand how the minister can turn a blind eye to the problem of air pollution in the city. Soft drinks, unlike air, are enjoyed by a limited number of people. Air pollution is likely to have more disastrous consequences in the near future than aerated drinks. Unfortunately, not much is being done to curtail this problem.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
D.K. Chanda, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  While it is shocking to hear about pesticides in soft drinks, one must realize that this is only a part of our daily problems. Today, the Indian government can inquire into the workings of the multinationals, and we can rave and rant on why these products should be banned. But what about the innumerable products laced with saturated fats that are available in the market and which do not have injurious to health labels affixed on them? What about the pesticide contents in vegetables and cereals and other edibles? One can easily detect the purple marks left by pesticides on cabbages and even potatoes. And these are consumed by a vast majority of the population. At the height of the cola controversy it would be inspiring to inquire into the toxic contents in other food products also. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ranjana Das, Calcutta

				 																Parting shot				 																																																				Sir  It is heart-warming to see the ebullient, irrepressible, paan-chewing Laloo Prasad Yadav doing something useful for India in Islamabad, especially since despite promise of talks by both the governments, there has been a slight hardening of stance between the countries of late (India or Pakistan, Laloo is (L)aloo, August 11).				 																																																				Laloo Prasad Yadav may be cutting a comic figure in Pakistan, but the image of Indian politicians that he presents may not be entirely false given their behaviour in Parliament and their habit of rushing to the well of the house at the drop of a hat. From the broader perspective of India-Pakistan relations, if Indias stern-looking politicians have not succeeded in breaking the ice till now, let them yield the floor to the Laloo Yadavs, with their native sense of humour and bonhomie. Yours faithfully, 
 Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Madison, US

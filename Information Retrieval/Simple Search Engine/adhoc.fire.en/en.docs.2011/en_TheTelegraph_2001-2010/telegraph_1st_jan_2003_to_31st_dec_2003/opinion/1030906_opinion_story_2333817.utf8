		 Saturday, September 06, 2003  HEALTH CAN STILL BE WEALTH
 Pressure from international organizations  and social groups can force food companies to promote a more  healthy diet among consumers, writes Derek Yach The author is representative of the  director-general of the World Health Organization Think before you  bite  While malnutrition continues to  afflict some one billion people globally, an equal number  of people are now overweight, some 300 million of them clinically  obese. Chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease,  cancers, diabetes and obesity now account for almost 60  per cent of total global deaths. Diet-related risk factors  such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol now affect  many hundreds of millions of people worldwide. And these are no longer rich country  afflictions. The globalization of the marketing and distribution  of foods high in fats, sugar and salt, urbanization, together  with a marked decrease in physical activity, are amongst  the key causes that have resulted in chronic diseases dominating  the disease profile of five out of World Health Organizations  six regions; only in Africa do communicable diseases still  dominate. The majority of this death and disability now  falls in developing countries. Cardiovascular disease is  expected to be the leading cause of death in developing  countries by 2010. India now has the most diabetes sufferers  worldwide, with an estimated 31.5 million in 2000. From least to most developed countries,  overweight is on the rise. This is leading governments worldwide  to closely examine the mounting costs of health care. And  for developing world countries, it is increasingly imposing  a double burden of chronic disease, along with existing  infectious and malnutrition-related conditions. Some Western governments have  already actively considered options such as taxing fatty  food in the hope that, like the sin taxes on alcohol and  tobacco, they will discourage consumption of unhealthy food.  WHO has been engaged for the past year in proactive discussions  with private sector food and beverage companies to urge  them to commit to creating healthier food choices as part  of wide-ranging consultations on the global strategy being  developed on diet, physical activity, and health. Imagine, then, that a major food  company were to announce a review of its product lines to  incrementally reduce sugar, salt and saturated fats. That  it pledged to scrap trans-fatty acids from all products;  ensure that marketing to children did not encourage excess  consumption; offer more fresh fruits, vegetables and whole  grain products; invest in new products with enhanced health  potential; advocate mandatory physical activity in schools;  and retire their most obesity-related lines. How would the public health community  react? Would they call it another profit-seeking gimmick?  Or would they recognize it as a potentially massive gain  for public health? In July, American food giant Kraft  Corp laid down just such a challenge. WHO welcomed Krafts  announcement that it intended to reduce the fat content  in its food, phase out in-school marketing and review the  type of foods it supplied in food vending machines. Notwithstanding  Krafts motives, for a major food company to acknow- ledge  that the global availability and marketing of unhealthy  food pose a serious public health challenge is a significant  step. We are aware that other companies  are researching similar strategic shifts. Such changes would  be a victory for many who have advocated and tried to legislate  healthier choices related to diet and physical activity.  But most important, consumers worldwide would benefit. If  food companies go a step further, and acknowledge that making  healthy choices, easy choices requires government and  non-government actions to complement industry initiatives,  real progress will happen. WHO advocates a comprehensive  approach to diet, nutrition and physical activity that draws  upon the expertise and abilities of the private sector,  NGOs and consumer groups  steered by government action.  Only a few months ago, several food companies and their  trade associations responded to this inclusive approach  by denying that there was a global public health problem  related to diet. When they did acknowledge it, many tended  to minimize the role of industry in creating or resolving  the problem. Industry groups maintained that  more physical activity was the solution to obesity. But  they denied that specific foods played a role in obesity,  cardiovascular disease or dental caries. Now, a combination  of pressures is influencing boardroom decisions like never  before. These forces include a wave of popular books and  media coverage; investment analyst reports on the financial  risks for companies with obesogenic products; litigation  against food companies and the attendant damage to brand  image (even if cases fail); new legal and regulatory initiatives  around the world; and consumer demand for healthier options. Food company innovation to address  public health demands will be based upon enlightened self-interest.  This is understandable in a free market environment. Corporate  leaders will stress that food companies are not like tobacco  companies, and that policy measures used for tobacco control  do not apply to their products. They are likely to push  hard for an incentive-driven approach that acknowledges  industrys role as part of the solution, and creates conditions  for companies to compete on health grounds for future customers. The public health community needs  to be ready for these new approaches. It will take considerable  skill and foresight to ensure that positive offers are embraced,  and that areas of disagreement continue to be discussed. In all likelihood we will head  into relatively uncharted waters for food and nutrition  policy. Food companies will expect better economic and regulatory  incentives for them to be able to move faster. NGOs and  consumer groups will continue to push for stronger regulations  and laws in areas such as advertising to children, taxes  on bad foods, and better labelling. What may emerge is  a collaborative approach that brings governments, industry  and consumers together to review and resolve these issues.  At an international level, one policy change worth pushing  is amendment of the UN Global Compact so that health, alongside  environment, human rights and labor, is a condition for  membership. New health criteria would challenge food companies  core business areas and, if implemented, lead to real health  gains. Over the next few months, public  health advocates and policy-makers will find that food companies  are changing faster than anyone anticipated. We need to  be ready to suggest how to interact with those that demonstrate  leadership in health and wellness. We need to avoid endless  debates with trade associations that continue to oppose  change. Provided we keep our focus on the attainment of  public health, we should be able to use new forms of public-private  interaction to make rapid progress against epidemics of  diet and physical activity-related chronic disease.

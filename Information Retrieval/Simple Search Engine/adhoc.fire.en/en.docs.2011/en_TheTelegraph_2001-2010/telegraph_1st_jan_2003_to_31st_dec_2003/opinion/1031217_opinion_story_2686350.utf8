																								A state that does not exercise its authority runs the risk of losing it. For far too long, rebel groups from Indias North-east had challenged Bhutans sovereignty by setting up camps there. The offensive that the Royal Bhutanese Army has now launched to dismantle the camps was long overdue. If Thimphu had delayed the action, it was primarily because it had hoped that persuasion, rather than force, would help. That the hope was misplaced was proved by the endless prevarication by the militant outfits, which went back on their promise to wind up the camps. Clearly, outfits like the United Liberation Front of Asom and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland had brazenly used their discussions with Thimphu only to buy time and hide their real intentions. They had little concern for either the sovereignty or the peace and security of the small Himalayan kingdom. The countrys national assembly had seen through the militants devious argument that their battle was against, not Bhutan, but India. By setting up camps inside Bhutan, the rebels posed a threat to the countrys own peace and security. By refusing to wind them up despite repeated warnings from Thimphu, they posed a challenge to its authority that no sovereign country could ignore. 																								But there is a much larger dimension to Bhutans action. International laws and treaties make it obligatory for a country not to allow another countrys terrorists or rebels to operate from its soil. Thimphu could not have ignored the fact that New Delhi has always opposed attempts by Bhutanese dissidents to use Indian territory for their political movements in southern Bhutan. Unfortunately, such cooperation has not marked Indias relations with some of its other neighbours. Bangladesh, for instance, not only has done little to dismantle the camps and hideouts of the secessionist groups from Tripura inside that country, but also refuses to admit their presence in its territory. Obviously, some regimes still believe in the outdated theory of using a neighbours insurgents as a tool of diplomacy. There is a clear message for Dhaka in Thimphus action.

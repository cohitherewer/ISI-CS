 															- Document From the Asian Centre for Human Rights  alternate report to Indias first periodic report for the  UN committee on the rights of the child 				 	 Make room																								Although, there are over 5000,000 conflict-induced internally displaced persons, in its first periodic report, the government of India only refers to the displaced Kashmir pandits. Majority of the internally displaced persons are indigenous peoples. A large number of IDPs are children. While the Kashmiri pandits are provided cash relief of Rs 600 per head per month subject to a maximum of Rs. 2400 per month per family plus dry ration 9 kgs of rice and 2 kgs of flour per person and one kg of sugar per family per month, the Reang IDPs are provided...Rs 80 per adult per month and...Rs 40 per child per month. While the assistance given to the Kashmiri pandits is insufficient by itself, there could not be a better example of glaring discrimination against indigenous IDPs.																								Child Labour: The Asian Centre for Human Rights conducted a study of the replies given by the government of India to the parliament...on the eradication of child labour since the consideration of the initial report of the government of India by the Convention on the Rights of the Child Committee...fr- om February 24, 2000 to August 22, 2003. The ACHR study shows that the government of India has little seriousness to eliminate child labour. The government data on child labour, as provided in the 1991 census, do not appear to be convincing and logical. Nonetheless, without releasing the data on child labour of the 2001 census, the government has been making budgetary allocations under the tenth five year plan. The meagre funds allotted for eradication of child labour are not fully utilized. Under the eighth plan period (1992-97), out of Rs 100.76 crore allocated, only Rs 74.71 crore was actually utilized...Under the ninth plan (1997-2002), out of Rs. 249.60 crore allocated, only Rs. 167.42 crore i.e. about 41.84 crore per year has been utilized by November 2001...																								There is no specific poverty eradication programme for the rehabilitation of child labour. The conviction rate under the Child Labour (Prohibition amp; Regulation) Act, 1986 is extremely low. During 2000-01 and 2001-02, 24,985 inspections were carried out and prosecutions launched in 99 cases, which resulted in only 13 convictions.																								Indigenous children: While children as individuals enjoy many of the rights provided under the United Nations convention on the rights of the child, the enjoyment of such rights by the indigenous and minority children depends on the status of these groups as a whole in the society and in the country. The condition of indigenous children cannot be seen in abstract but should be viewed in the context of the status of the community.Many indigenous groups are still identified as criminal tribes. Their children are stigmatized.																								According to the government of Indias ministry of tribal affairs, since independence, the majority of the tribals displaced by development projects or industries have not been rehabilitated to date. Research shows that the number of displaced tribal till 1990 is about 85.39 lakh (55.16 per cent of total displaced) of whom 64.23 per cent are yet to be rehabilitated. Although accurate figures of displacement vary, it is clear that majority of those displaced have not been rehabilitated. The indigenous peoples who constitute about 8.1 per cent of the total population of the country according to the 1991 census constitute, 55.16 per cent of total displaced people.																								About 10 million indigenous peoples and their children are on the verge of eviction in the name of conservation of forest pursuant to the order of 5 May 2002 of the ministry of environment and forest...

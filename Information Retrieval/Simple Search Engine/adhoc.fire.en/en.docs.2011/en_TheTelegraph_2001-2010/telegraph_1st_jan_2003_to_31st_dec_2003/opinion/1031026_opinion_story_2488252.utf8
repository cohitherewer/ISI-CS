The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, October 26, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																To Pakistan with insincerity				 																																																				Sir  With its on-again-off-again peace initiatives vis--vis Pakistan, the Vajpayee governments incomprehensibility is on the rise (A dozen for Pak, Advani for Kashmir, Oct 23). The sudden announcement of a dozen conciliatory gestures  to mend bilateral relations perhaps?  appears insincere more than anything else. Remember, the Pakistani foreign minister, Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, was not welcomed to India last month. So what has changed in the few weeks since then? Has Pakistan stopped aiding and abetting cross-border terrorism? Or has Washington demanded a soft stance from India? Or is this A.B. Vajpayees festival gift for Pakistan? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, R. Sen, Calcutta
				 																Injury time				 																																																				Sir  One fails to understand why it is taking so long for Sourav Ganguly to recover, apparently from a simple boil. In this day and age of advanced treatment, when a patient is released within a fortnight of a bypass surgery, why does the Indian skipper have to be hospitalized for so many days? Could it be that there were some lapses in his treatment in Chandigarh, which necessitated a second surgery? I also have a feeling that things would not have taken such a serious turn, had Ganguly not played in the first test. But since he not only played but also scored a century, few are going to find fault with his decision to play. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Anagh Pal, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  This is turning out to be a particularly bad time for Indian sports. First, Leander Paes was taken ill with a suspected brain lesion. Then Indian hockeys promising star, Yugraj Singh, suffered serious injuries in a car accident. And now, Sourav Ganguly has been ruled out of at least the first few one-dayers in the ongoing tri-series involving India, New Zealand and Australia. 				 																																																				But there is a silver lining to this cloud of woes. First, Paes has come back fully recovered from his ailment. Second, India won the Champions Trophy even without the services of Yugraj Singh, who, with good treatment abroad, should come back to the game soon And finally, if India will be without Ganguly, so will Australia be without Brett Lee, Darren Lehmann and Jason Gillespie in the tri- series. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Sucharita Gomes, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Sourav Ganguly needs to get well really fast. The Mohali test against New Zealand has shown up the glaring difference between him and the rest as far as leading the team is concerned.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																Violent ways				 																																																				Sir  If violence against women is on the rise in India, then it can be attributed to the vulgar soaps telecast on prime-time slots of private television channels. Not only are they full of objectionable images and ideas, they also portray women as sex objects.The information and broadcasting ministry should take steps to check such abuse of public space.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
R. Sekar, Angul

				 																																																				Sir  Mainstream Hindi cinema is increasingly donning a violent look. The censor board must ensure that violence remains within permissible limits in the films. Films in India are watched by the young and the old alike, and it cannot be denied that violence on screen has a negative impact on the young. The censor board should take note of this.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
T.R. Anand, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Prakash Jha deserves congratulations for making a film on the Bhagalpur blindings (Gangaajal echo in Bihar blindings, Oct 5). While the rest of the Hindi film industry dishes out saccharine romantic plots and family entertainers, a few like Jha have the guts to deal with reality. The commercial success of Gangaajal could rekindle our interest in the genre of hard-hitting, experimental films.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Shivani Ghosh, Calcutta

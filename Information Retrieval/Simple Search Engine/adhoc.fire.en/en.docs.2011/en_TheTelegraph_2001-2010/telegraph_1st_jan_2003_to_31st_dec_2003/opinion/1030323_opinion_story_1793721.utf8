The Telegraph - Jamshedpur
		 Sunday, March 23, 2003  DIARY
				 																																																																														 Seen and heard at the inauguration of the Trinamool party office in the capitals Mahabir Road: 				 																																													Ranjit Panja: Does this mean we are on the defensive? (at George Fernandess doing the honours)				 																																													A Trinamool MP, best left unnamed (advising a colleague on how to handle a freak cold): If youre short of money, you can try one of those pills. But if you dont mind spending a bit, try rum with hot water or better still, brandy  ask the BJP!				 																																													Sundry voices (in loud whispers): Wonder how didi overcame this Advani? 				 																																													[The rather unkind reference is to Purnima Advani, chief of the National Womens Commission, who had for long refused to budge from the Mahabir Road house to make way for Mamata Banerjees party. The even unkinder innuendo is directed at the Bengal leaders less-than-cordial relations with the better-known Advani  Lal Krishna  who has supposedly kept her out of the cabinet.]				 																																													All star cast, comprising M Venkaiah Naidu and Yerran Naidu, besides Fernandes. Sideshow, that threatens to assume centrestage, featuring a strangely subdued and silent Sudip Bandopadhyay, minus significant other Nayana, and various constituency side-kicks, who despite being in New Delhi, didnt do duty at didis do. 				 																																													So what shall we call the drama  New Order in the Palace?				 																																																																														 Theres something about Mamata Banerjee that makes other politicians  be they allies or foes  wary. Perhaps it is her penchant for histrionics. Remember how she is always telling the media that she does not care for security, that she would rather live like any other common citizen? So what is the Bengal tigress doing asking the Union home minister, LK Advani, to elevate her security cover to Z plus category? Apparently, she is afraid that the security personnel provided her by the state government are keeping tabs on her movements. If that isnt double standards, wonder what is.				 																																																																														 But to be fair to Mamata, she is a babe in the woods compared to what the UP chief minister Mayavati has turned out to be. Not only did the lady emerge unscathed from the video tape expos, but she even managed to floor Mumbais rich and powerful with her charm on a recent visit to the city. Top industrialists like Kumaramangalam Birla, Anand Mahendra, OP Kasliwal, Nusli Wadia were so impressed they sent her back with letters of intent worth Rs 20,000 crore. But behenjis more notable conquests were among film fraternity  Mahesh Bhatt, Smita Thackeray, Shatrughan Sinha and Tabu. Perhaps, theyll now ask her to act in a film.				 																																																																														 The war clouds in distant Iraq are hovering over Indore, threatening to postpone or simply put off the BJPs national executive to be held in that city. That, at any rate, is the official version of things. The unofficial and for that reason, more believable, version is that it is a ploy to skirt the tricky issue of party discipline. To be more precise, what to do about Shanta Kumar and his role in the Himachal election debacle. Already the issue has led to a clash among the acolytes of Arun Jaitley and Pramod Mahajan. Jaitley has sought to cover his back saying that after his induction into the Union cabinet, he couldnt give his best. Mahajans cronies discount such excuses and say that the party lost because tickets were given to people who had not a ghost of a chance of winning. Besides, there are also the factional feuds in the other states where elections will be held this year  Delhi, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. 				 																																													Those who want the national pow-wow to be postponed feel that a post mortem will achieve nothing, that it is far better for the tempers to cool down before a future agenda is chalked out. Thats one side of the story, of course, the other being that it is precisely by letting things slide indefinitely that the mess in Himachal came about.				 																																																																														 Firebrand sadhu Acharya Dharmendra is miffed. Why did Digvijay Singh have to arrest him on the eve of Holi? It meant he had to spend the festival of colours in the company of petty criminals in Ujjain jail. Then, the bandh called by the Bajrang Dal in protest at his arrest turned out to be a damp squib because BJP and VHP activists were busy with Holi bandobast. Singh of course offered the acharya a way out of his misery  apologize for the remarks against the minority community and get amnesty. But he was turned down. To make matters worse, both AB Vajpayee and LK Advani are peeved with him for his remarks against them at the VHPs dharma sansad. And so there was no respite Acharya Dharmendra.				 																																																																														 Heard from the opposition benches as Asim Dasgupta was entering the state legislature to present the state budget: Wah Asimbabu, naya shirt, naya pant, purana budget! Badiya hai!				 																																																																														 Is the tiger finally changing its spots? Sanjay Nirupam, the Shiv Senas pointsman in the Rajya Sabha and the man who had once abused Dilip Kumar and reduced Shabana Azmi to tears, thinks Muslims are as patriotic as anyone else. Miracles will never cease.				 																																													It all began with Nirupams daughter coming home one day and telling her father that a Pakistani in her class was supporting the Indian cricket team. Initially taken aback to know that a Pakistani boy was studying with his daughter in an upmarket public school in Mumbai, Nirupam probed further, only to discover that his daughter had mistaken a Muslim for a Pakistani. But all Muslims are not Pakistanis, the concerned father explained to his daughter, adding Muslims in India love the country and the cricket team just like us. Very creditable and secular of Nirupam, who must be the only politician not to preach what he practises. But wonder what his leader, Bal Thackeray  who lays the blame for all the ills affecting India  from poverty to traffic snarls  on Pakistan, thinks of it?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, December 13, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Toying with fire				 																																																				Sir  Murli Manohar Joshis call to ban combat toys and war games must be first tried on sangh parivar cadre and their wards(Joshi war on war games and toys, Dec 10). The human resource development minister seems to have forgotten that the Hindu right has been responsible for several violent acts  the pogrom in Gujarat, Graham Staines murder and the post-Babri Masjid riots. Initiation into non-violent games like ludo should be the doctors order for old and young saffronites, and not ordinary young boys. For juvenile violence is a product of several factors, not of indulgence in combat toys and games alone.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Shishir Mitra, Calcutta
				 																Players, not gentlemen				 																																																				Sir  Cases of corruption in cricket no longer come as a surprise (Kale decision deferred, Dec 7). Cricket is merely an extension of the general administration of the country, where individuals with any kind of discretionary power are largely susceptible to corruption. Cricket has become a source of unlimited income in the recent years, for players of the national squad and for the administrators. 				 																																																				An honest opinion poll on Indian cricketers will confirm that the criterion of selection is anything but performance. This is the case even in state junior teams, leave alone the Ranji trophy or national squads. Manipulations are not uncommon. Even television commentators voice their preferences quite publicly. Who knows if there is a deeper meaning to all this. Abhijit Kale might or might not have followed the standard procedure, but the only question is why were his advances rejected? Was his offer too little to be accepted?				 																																																				Yours faithfully 																															
Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It will go on record that Bengal drew with Assam in the Ranji Trophy of 2003 owing to poor light. Posterity will not come to know the role played by the men in white coats in denying the underdogs the victory that was their due (Umpires deny Assam victory, Dec 5). The Board of Control for Cricket in India and the Cricket Association of Bengal owe some explanation to the public, but more importantly, to the Assam players. Incidents like these tarnish the image of Indian cricket as much, if not more, as incidents of betting and bribery.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  I was sorry to read that the school where Sachin Tendulkar studied has fallen on bad times. Rupees three crore is required for its repair, nearabout what its most famous alumnus earns in endorsements every month. The least Sachin Tendulkar could have done was help his alma mater in its hour of need. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  It is disheartening to see sporting icons stooping low by promoting poison in the garb of soft drinks. They cannot shrug their responsibility of setting examples for others to emulate. But by giving in to the greed for money, they are proving to be poor role models. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Arnab Banerjee, Calcutta

				 																Rotten service				 																																																				Sir  I renewed my internet account with Tata Indicomm on October 23, 2003. They had organized a promotional campaign in which various prizes were given away. I was informed that I had won a personal stereo. But I have not received my prize till date. In response to my queries, the company stated that the prizes had been dispatched within 18 days. They have even stopped responding to my emails. This is not expected from a Tata group company.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  It is regrettable that the Unit Trust of India is again reneging on its financial commitments to investors. The master-share dividend was to have been credited latest by October 16 this year. They have not been credited yet. Neither has the bank communicated with investors. All this speaks poorly of the UTI.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Avijit Chatterjee, Calcutta

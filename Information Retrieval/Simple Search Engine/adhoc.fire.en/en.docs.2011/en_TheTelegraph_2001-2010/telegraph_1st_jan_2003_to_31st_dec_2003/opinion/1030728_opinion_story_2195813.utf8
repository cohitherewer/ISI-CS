 - Can legislation bring about good corporate governance?  Commentarao / S.L. Rao The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission  raoslhotmail.com When the Naresh Chandra report  on corporate governance was released and amendments proposed  in the Companies Act, many welcomed it. Jamshed Irani, however,  made a practical comment. Legislation, by itself, he said,  would not bring about improved governance. In my view, it  is the mindset of owners, promoters and others who form  the governance of a company which has to change. If legislation  was all that was required, India would by now be a socially  reformed country, with no dowry, no sexual harassment at  work or elsewhere, no child labour, universal education,  no discrimination on account of religion or caste, and so  on. It is not the existence of a law but the willingness  to obey it, and on the part of the state, to enforce compliance,  that matter.  It is not as if companies are  governed in the best possible way in developed countries.  The many reports of corporate misbehaviour by chief executive  officers in some of the largest and best-known companies  in the United States of America demonstrate the non-compliance  of a few. The punishments meted out to those who are caught  ensure that more comply than defy.  India has many instances of such  non-compliance by managements of the principles of good  governance, perhaps on a smaller scale. But rarely has any  manager or promoter been severely punished. The recent  disclosures from Britannia are probably only the tip of  a large iceberg, not merely in that company but in many  others. Little is disclosed to shareholders since companies  fear that the damage might spread and disclose the misdoings  by many more in the company including the owner-promoters  and the CEOs.  Nor are government-owned companies  models of good governance. Many of them are said to have  been sources of illegal funding for political parties and  individual politicians. Some company executives are said  to have diverted large sums to bribe influential figures  for securing appointments to plum positions. It is common  knowledge that many of them pay for the expenses on telephones  and telephone calls, entertainment, five-star hotel accommodation,  air conditioners and so on, of important officials in ministries  that control them.  Legislation is not going to stop  all this. What will make managers more careful are transparency,  disclosure, speedy prosecution and trials, and severe punishment.  But it can never be stopped altogether. Successful CEOs   like leaders in other fields, with people hanging on to  their every word, the media building their image (with some  help from public relations agencies), vast powers over everyone  in their companies  after a while develop a sense of their  invulnerability and indispensability. They begin to feel  that the normal laws and mores no longer applied to them.  The Greeks called this hubris. Even the legendary  Jack Welch does not appear to have escaped this feeling.  When he was in charge, GE was considered the greatest company  and Welch the most effective manager in history. After he  left the company, some skeletons have appeared out of the  GE closet and the present CEO has had to manfully pick up  the pieces while avoiding any adverse reference to his predecessor. Will independent directors, audit  committees, compulsory cost and secretarial audits, and  other new rules introduced by law make a major difference?  As many commentators in Britain and the US have pointed  out, owners-promoters-CEOs appoint the independent directors.  There are growing financial rewards to these directors.  Can we expect all of them to be uninfluenced by the money?  How independent will they be in expressing opinions when  their retaining such rewards by remaining on the boards  might depend on the goodwill of the people who invited them? There is another problem in India.  We have over a billion in population, but that does not  mean that we have a large reservoir of talented people who  can contribute to a companys better governance. We need  to have a clear understanding of the skills we need from  independent directors. They are there to ensure good governance.  They need not be entrepreneurs. The owner or promoter or  the employee-CEO fills that role. But independent directors, like  other directors, must have knowledge and understanding of  the social, political and economic environment, corporate  accounting and finance, human resources management, experience  in discovering the reality behind information given to them,  and the mental strength to separate financial rewards from  the independence of their opinions. Perhaps a neutral outside*  body could scrutinize and prepare a list of all those who  might be invited to join a companys board. Companies might  then be forbidden from inviting anyone from outside such  a list. This might prevent grace and favour appointments  and ensure the appointment of qualified people.  But the suggestion that there  must be a minimum number of women on corporate boards does  nothing to improve the status of women, while it lowers  the quality and effectiveness of boards. If there are not  many women directors, the reason is our social conditioning  that compels talented women to make their careers subservient  to those of their husbands. That leaves very few women who  have served in senior positions for long enough to be of  value as independent directors of companies.  One suggestion that has been made  in Britain is that independent directors should have one  of them as a second head like the chairman of the company,  who can go into any aspect of the company. But this might  be diluting the authority and responsibility of the chairman  of the board and even of senior managers. What is eminently  possible is that independent directors meet by themselves,  that they meet operating managers from time to time, and  reinforce each other so that they do function independently.  Another possibility is to put definite limits to their terms  of office so that the temptation of another term on the  board does not influence their judgment. The law now places great reliance  on independent audit committees to ensure that all is well  with the accounting policies and adherence to them by the  company. This may work well in small companies and those  with limited diversity of operations. But a large and diverse  company has many ways in which accounts could be dressed  up for many years to look good. WorldCom did that for many  years in the US until they could not continue with their  malpractices.  Companies marketing consumer products  spend vast sums of money on advertising and promotion. No  audit committee is in a position to examine these expenses  for their need, adequacy or excess and the quality of the  advertising or promotion. Their competence and information  will be insufficient. Many marketing decisions ultimately  are based on intuition, and audit committees are not supposed  to look at accounts with intuition, only at their compliance  with policy. Auditors after the Arthur Anderson-Enron  episode in the US have now distanced themselves from responsibility  for the accuracy of the accounts that they audit. It is  too much to expect independent directors to be able to do  so. Ultimately, it is the quality of the CEO and management  that will ensure it. Perhaps we could encourage insiders  to report malpractices and protect them from vengeance.  At the same time we must also be able to deal with those  who use the opportunity to sabotage their seniors, a practice  quite common in government and the public sector. There is no magic wand for good  corporate governance. It requires a strong base in ethics  and values. It demands tough penalties that are enforced  quickly, even to the extent of sending thieving CEOs to  jail as the US has done quite often. By itself, legislation  without severe consequences for violators will take us nowhere.  This is particularly the case when large violations by ministers  and bureaucrats go unpunished. The corporate executive has  poor role models to follow from public life.

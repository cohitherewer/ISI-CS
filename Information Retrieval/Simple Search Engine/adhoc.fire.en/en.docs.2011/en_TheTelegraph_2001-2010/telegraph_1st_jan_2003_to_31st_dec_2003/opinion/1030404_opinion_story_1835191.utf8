 Arnab Bhattacharya																								Drama Contemporary: India Edited by Erin B. Mee, Oxford, Rs 395																								In the true tradition of a multilingual and multicultural country, theatre has evolved spontaneously, and with mindboggling diversity, in India. Indian theatre, in the broader sense, covers a wide arena of performance-oriented activities both of religious and secular origin. Erin B. Mee, while compiling a volume of contemporary Indian dramas, has aptly pointed out, modern drama is a subset of theater, but is nonetheless connected to, and influenced by, many of these other performance forms.																								Each of the six plays in the volume is notably Indian in sprit. They do not, however, conclusively sum up the Indian reality or the Indian theatrical scenario. Mee admits that the plays as a whole demonstrate, and not necessarily represent, the enormous range of playwriting in India today.																								In explaining the background of the plays, Mee highlights the aesthetic movements they belong to, which were in their turn prompted by social or political movements. For example, Girish Karnads The Fire and the Rain and Kevalam Narayana Panikkars Aramba Chekkan are the products of the theatre of roots movement, Usha Gangulis Rudali belongs to the womens theatre movement, Tripurari Sharmas The Wooden Cart develops out of the street theatre modality, Datta Bhagats Routes and Escape Routes can be put under the rubric of Dalit literature. Mahesh Dattanis Tara, originally written in English, is exceptional in that it carries no tag of any specific movement behind it. Yet it exemplifies as well as re-examines the convention of English language playwriting in contemporary India.																								Of the six plays, Karnads is by far structurally the most complicated, with its innovative use of indigenous folk forms and Karnads own brand of play-within-the-play technique. Panikkars Aramba Chekkan realizes his concept of theatre as drisya kavya or visual poetry, which closely adapts the popular dance-drama from called kuttiyattam. Usha Gangulis Rudali, based Mahasweta Devis novella, belongs to the school of realistic drama.																								Of the remaining three plays, Tripurari Sharmas The Wooden Cart, which explores the social stigma of leprosy, was a production funded by the UNICEF, and it is obvious from this that the play aims at raising social awareness. 																								The plays brought together by Mee explore the various strata of the Indian reality and record the many voices that dwell within these layers. The purpose seemingly is to discover or retrieve a polyphony out of the cacophony.						ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

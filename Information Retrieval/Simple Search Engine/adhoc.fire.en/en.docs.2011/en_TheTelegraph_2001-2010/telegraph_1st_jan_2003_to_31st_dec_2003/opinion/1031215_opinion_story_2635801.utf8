 In what is perhaps the late Indian stage in our civilization, the idea is to take what you can and give back as little as possible, writes Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry of information and broadcasting				 	 Rising degeneration																								Some years ago, when the large Harappan settlement at Dhola Vira was excavated on a significant scale, the archaeologist in charge of the operations explained some of the details to me with the help of several photographs taken at the site. He pointed out features of some structures which he said were early Harappan and then others which he said represented the true Harappan style  and these were not only structures like pathways, walls and doorways, but a number of artefacts like earthenware pots and other vessels, seals and spearheads and a few figurines. Then he showed me photographs of a third set of structures which he called late Harappan.																								Whats the difference? I asked. 																								He explained that while the Harappan structures and other finds represented the efflorescence of the very best of the artistry of the times, the pre-Harappan pieces were not in the same category  they lacked the finish, the confident lines and curves that came with later years. The late Harappan structures were what he called degenerate and more coarse, with the techniques of the Harappan period done with excessive ornateness or with a casualness that took away from the artistry of the true Harappan pieces.																								I wondered whether you could pigeonhole societies quite so neatly and conveniently. It probably was a useful way to order the mass of information thrown up by the excavations. Just as the university syllabi in our times had papers on ancient Indian history, medieval history and modern history. It always intrigued me; was there a date when everyone said, Right, were no longer ancient, were medieval from now on? How did one draw a line through a complex intertwining of events, ideas, beliefs, relationships, and all that comprised social intercourse and say this lot belongs in this box, and the other lot in some other? 																								It is certainly necessary to use some kind of classification or ordering when considering the enormous mass of information available of times past. But what were the signs or symbols that helped in sifting one age from another? Looking at ourselves today, there may be some indicators that will be universally accepted. One is the facility with which we are able to compromise, to adjust and modify values that we profess are non-negotiable. We are aware that a dreadful crime has been committed by someone; we know of rampant dishonesty in every office, service and public facility that we have to use; we use products made locally which we can see are shoddy and mediocre; and yet we continue leading our lives with these as if there are no alternatives. 																								In our times, and it may well be true of other previous times as well, the basic principle of business was to make money but give as little as possible in return. The concept of giving good value for money is non-existent, except in some cases where it has been made into a virtue, and rightly so. This has been very often the starting point, the basic assumption, till it has been altered by someone who has made money but in return has given a product that is worth the money spent on it. One specific example is Amul butter. Before it came into the market the butter available was quite often rancid, or smelt unpleasant or was thin and looked unwholesome. All that has now changed because Amul butter swamped the market with good wholesome butter which drove the inferior varieties away. The point is not that Amul butter did this so much as the fact that inferior varieties were all we could get till Amul came into the market. The principle was; make your money and give the customer the bare minimum. 																								We are all aware of how widespread adulteration is. The adulteration of cooking oils, of medicines, of cement, of fuels, everything has been going on for quite some time and it is only the odd case that comes to light and where the authorities take some action. Its not that there are no dishonest or slightly bent businessmen in other countries; its just that here it seems to be the general rule. Adulteration; false stamp paper netting the organizers thousands of crores; Harshad Mehta; the man who leaks papers for all kinds of examinations; they are not rarities, they are everywhere. 																								But its not quite as simple as it seems. Consider, against all this, the information technology revolution, the kind of computer software Indians are producing out of their offices in Bangalore, Hyderabad and elsewhere. Consider some of the medical centres in different parts of the country, notably in Chennai; consider the skill, knowledge and ability of some of our surgeons and physicians. Sadly, there arent too many such examples, not enough to swamp mediocrity as Amul butter did.																								Then look again at the other side, the darker one. Where aircraft parts are bought from dubious sources for the Indian air force, whose planes crash with terrifying and tragic regularity. Are these two facts linked? Will those who enquire into this tell the truth to us all, or lie, taking refuge in public interest? When something is kept under wraps in what is called the public interest, it isnt as if those doing so dont know that the public arent fools and dont need to be protected from knowing what they, the authorities, know. They use the device to compromise with values, with quality, with mistakes that are often dreadful in their implications. Compromise is certainly not the monopoly of politicians; it is an art about which civil servants could teach politicians a thing or two.																								A diplomat friend once told me of the mortification he felt when he was asked by a German company about a query the company had received from an Indian commercial concern. The query was whether the German company could manufacture and supply machines that would produce tiny stone chips that looked like rice grains. What would they want with these small stone chips? the German company asked my diplomat friend. He had no coherent answer and gave them some kind of vague diplomatic reply. Then he sent the details of this to Delhi and recommended that the strongest possible action be taken against the Indian concern that obviously wanted to get into the business of adulterating rice on a grand scale. Till he left Germany he hadnt heard of what actually happened.																								And now lets consider the work being done by Indian engineers, scientists, managers and professionals in such fields as biochemistry or immunology in the West. In a different socio-cultural milieu. The majority are doing good work; many are doing exceptionally fine, pioneering work. In other words, they do good work, of a high standard, on the whole in those societies; here, in India, they are few in number and the standard of work is on the whole less than satisfactory. This is the India enigma, which defies a rational explanation.																								Except, perhaps, the one the archaeologist gave me about Harappa. Maybe this is the late Indian stage in our civilization, when everything is winding down. The good ones are leaving for other countries and working conditions; some are doggedly staying on because of their determination to work in their own country. But the majority have succumbed to the lotos-eating attitudes of a civilization in decline. Social lethargy is seeping into every crevice of activity. And all commerce, trade and other form of activity still rest on the principle of taking what you can and giving back as little as possible.

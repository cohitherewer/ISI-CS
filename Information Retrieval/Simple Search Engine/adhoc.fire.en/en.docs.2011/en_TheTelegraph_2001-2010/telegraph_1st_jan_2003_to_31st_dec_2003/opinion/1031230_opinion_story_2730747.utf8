																								Letting go is a difficult, but crucial, stage in every nurturing process. This is as true of filial bonds as of more political forms of paternalism. The Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad is currently going through a rite of passage, which might prove to be important for its mature self-definition. Its board of governors have declined, with impeccable politeness, the annual grant of Rs 10.5 crore from the Centre. This is certainly a significant moment in the IIMs relationship with its erstwhile nurturer, the Union ministry of human resource development, headed by Mr Murli Manohar Joshi. The institute insists that this is not a confrontational gesture, but a large-hearted one: it now has enough of its own money, and the Centre should therefore spend such a large sum of money where it will be really needed. But the IIMs decision comes after a history of resisted interventions from Mr Joshis ministry. The three premier institutes in Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta have all let Mr Joshi know, in various ways, that they are now in a position to assert their autonomy, not only over funding, but also over larger issues of administration and pedagogy.																								Mr Joshi had started by insisting on a single national-level entrance test for all business and management schools. This was refused by the IIMs. They have also resisted signing an annual memorandum of understanding, which would have obliged them to give the government a detailed account of their plans. It would have also prevented them from maintaining more than Rs 25 crore in their corpus. The pressure to comply with the ministry had been stepped up after the common admission test fiasco, with the handling of which Mr Joshi would have liked to be more peremptory. There have been persistent directives regarding the fee-structure as well. So the IIMs large-heartedness towards the Centre is the result of successfully steering through these pressures in order to retain, so far, its academic, administrative and financial freedom uncompromised. And this is part of the natural course of things. In the initial stages of nation-building, the government certainly needed to create and then develop the education sector. But now that some of its institutions have given ample proof of self-sufficiency, the government should know how to withdraw with grace and let these institutes manage on their own. There are plenty of international models for such self-governance, and the minister would do well to take heed of these. The ultimate test is, of course, academic excellence  and in this, the IIMs have certainly shown Mr Joshi that they can hold out on their own.

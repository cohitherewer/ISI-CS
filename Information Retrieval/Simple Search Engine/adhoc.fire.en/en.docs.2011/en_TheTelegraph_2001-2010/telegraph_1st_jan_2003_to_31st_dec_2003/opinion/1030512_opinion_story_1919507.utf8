		 Monday, May 12, 2003  WINDOW ON THE GLOBE
 - The World Economic Outlooks forecast deserves careful  study  S. VENKITARAMANAN The author is former governor, Reserve  Bank of India The World Economic Outlook  is the authoritative statement issued by the International  Monetary Fund. It puts together the IMFs views on the global  economy for the years ahead. The WEO 2003 was issued  with great fanfare at Washington to coincide with the April  meetings of the interim committee and the development committee  of the Bretton Woods twins. Not much notice has been taken  in India of either these meetings or the WEO. This  shows, to some extent, the distance travelled by India since  the reforms, as a result of which the happenings in Washington  have ceased to have much impact on our situation. The relaxation of the foreign  exchange constraint, our abundant foreign exchange and food  reserves  all these continue to create in our policy-makers  a welcome cessation of concern about what the masters in  the World Bank and IMF would be thinking. We are no longer  dependent on the flow of aid from these organizations. Gone  are the days when we used to tremble when the president  of the World Bank or the managing director of IMF would  frown on us.  It is thanks to the bold initiatives  taken by Manmohan Singh and P.V. Narasimha Rao that we are  able to hold our heads high and not to go on aid-seeking  minions at every meeting of the Fund-Bank duo. The media  are not treated to elaborate expositions of what stand our  delegates took at the meetings nor of their apparent triumphs.  A virtual declaration of independence from the Bretton Woods  twins  at least for the present! The World Bank seems content  with preaching to us about better governance. The IMF also  has other pressing issues to consider. But the watchdog role of the Bretton  Woods institutions in the global economy continues to be  important. They are institutions of last resort when a country  faces financial distress. It is, therefore, right and proper  that we should heed what they say, in particular, their  forecasts about the global economy. The WEO 2003  is focussed on various issues of global import and deserves  careful study. What one looks to the WEO  for is a forecast of global growth prospects. Its forecasts  assemble the best guesses and estimates of experts, both  within the IMF and outside. Many observers of the global  economic scene give great weight to what the WEO  says. The WEO 2003 factors in the various developments  in the leading economies of the world. It takes into account  the high corporate debt levels, excess industrial capacity,  faltering pension system and above all, the impact of the  geopolitical developments  in particular the Iraq War. The WEO notes that global  forecast for 2003 will be a bit more conservative than the  one it put forth in September 2002. It estimates a rate  of growth of the global economy at 3.2 per cent for 2003  and 4.2 per cent for 2004. As for the United States of America,  the WEO estimates a low rate of growth of 1.9 per  cent in 2003 and 2.9 per cent in 2004. Japan hits the low  forecast of 0.8 per cent for 2003 and 1 per cent for 2004.  The bright spots in the global  economy are not surprising  India and China  with expected  rate of growth of 5.1 to 5.9 per cent for India and 7.5  per cent for China. Does this argue that India and China  are doing something right which other countries are not?  Or does the growth of the rest of the world prop up these  two countries? The WEO 2003 notes that  in the West, in the US, Canada and the United Kingdom, monetary  policies have been eased considerably in response to the  global slowdown. So have fiscal policies. Japan presents  a peculiar case, in that monetary policy has no scope for  further easing with interest rates already at the zero levels  and fiscal policy has little room for manoeuvres with the  heavy debt burden of the government. The Euro area also  has limitations  the growth and stability pact restricts  the flexibility of fiscal action and monetary easing is  slow in coming. Considering all these factors, the WEO  2003 notes that global recovery is expected to continue  at a relatively subdued pace, with the gross domestic product  growth in major currency areas remaining below potential. The WEO 2003 signals that  monetary policy can be expected to remain accommodative  in the Euro area. In plain English, it is arguing for low  interest rates and more flow of credit. In spite of all  this, the prospects of growth in Germany, in particular,  are not too bright. Germany might see yet another year of  growth under 1 per cent; this will be the third year of  slow growth for an economy already facing heavy unemployment.  Japan is also in a difficult situation with growth almost  stagnant and threat of deflation. The WEO 2003 highlights  yet another striking feature of todays global economy:  the manner in which the imperial power, the US, is nurtured  and supported by the savings of the rest of the world. A  revealing appendix to the WEO shows that the current  account deficit of the US in 2002 was $ 503 billion and  would rise to $ 576 billion in 2003. In terms of GDP, the  current account deficit of the US runs as high as 5 per  cent. If such a deficit is run by any emerging economy,  the wise men of the IMF will be all over it with the harsh  counsel of devaluation and fiscal tightening. All hell will  break loose.  But then, the US has different  rules to play by because the rest of the world gives its  savings to the US for safekeeping. The Euro area, emerging  Asia, Japan  all have substantial current account surpluses.  They export more than they import. They invest their surpluses  in the securities of the worlds superpower. It is this  large draft on the rest of the world, which sustains the  USs spending spree as well as its adventurism. In fact,  its fiscal deficit translates into demand for funds, which  are supplied by the rest of the world investing their reserves  in the USs gilt-edged securities.  The WEO does not read the  riot act to the US because the US is part of the support  system for IMF. But the fact remains that the US adventure  in Iraq was willy-nilly funded by cash flow from the rest  of the world, particularly emerging Asia and Japan. The WEO often takes up  a theme for discussion. In September 2002, it used the platform  for discussing and advocating trade reforms  both for developing  and for developed countries. This time, the focus is on  institutional reforms. WEO 2003 rightly asks the  question, What is it that explains the differences in industrial  countries rates of growth? Even if we take into account  divergences in factor endowment, resources and climate,  there is always a residual factor, which cannot be explained.  The WEO 2003 states that  the differences between countries in physical capital and  education level can only go so far in explaining cross-country  differences in rates of growth. It hypothesizes that the  character of institutions and their level of development  may be an important factor in the variation. Based on sophisticated  measurement of institutional development  reflecting the  degree of corruption, public sector efficiency, rule of  law, regulatory burden  the WEO establishes a close  correlation between institutions and economic growth. The  correlation is also intuitively obvious. The better the  governance of a country, the easier it is for entrepreneurship  to flourish. Another theme the WEO 2003  focusses on is the need for structural reform of labour  markets. It points out that in Europe, where labour markets  are backward, unemployment rates are high. The areas of  reform in labour markets are the generous unemployment compensation,  centralized wage bargaining processes, strict employment  protection and high taxation of labour income. It states  that the UK and Netherlands, which have reformed labour  markets, have achieved a sharp reduction in unemployment.  The nearer the model gets to the US type of labour relations,  suggests the WEO 2003, the better it would be. There  is much food for thought here, although I would not fully  endorse the WEOs view. China offers a study in contrast,  but seems to be doing well. This takes some to yet another  dilemma, which the WEO tries not to discuss. True,  the US model of governance has done well for that country.  But how come that China and India are still clocking up  high rates of growth, in spite of their departure from the  US model? There may be something in the state-led patterns  of economic development of China, which the rest of the  world may have to study.  The WEO 2003 has, as usual,  provided a fund of data and analysis on global economics.  It raises many questions and attempts a few answers. One  may differ from it, but one cannot ignore it.

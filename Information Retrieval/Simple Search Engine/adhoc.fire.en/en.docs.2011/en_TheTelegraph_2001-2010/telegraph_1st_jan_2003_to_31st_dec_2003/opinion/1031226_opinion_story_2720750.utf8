		 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 CHRONICLE OF A LIFE FORETOLD
				 	 Act of remembrance Living to Tell the tale By Gabriel  Garca Mrquez, Alfred A. Knopf, Rs 695 Like the curates egg, Gabriel  Garca Mrquezs memoirs are good only in parts. But this  is not to say that the less-good parts are very bad. This  is, of course, the first volume of a three volume study.  It fails to captivate in the way that his novels inevitably  do.																								One reason for this is the amount of details that Mrquez packs in. His family, and its network, was huge and it is often difficult to keep track of whos who and the nature of the relationships. The bewilderment is compensated by some memorable character sketches, especially those of the authors parents and grandparents.																								The book, like most of Mrquezs novels, has a dramatic and a compelling start: My mother asked me to go with her to sell the house. For both mother and son, the house could only refer to one place in the world: my grandparents old house in Aracataca, where Id had the good fortune to be born, and where I had not lived again after the age of eight. It is the trip to sell that ancestral house  a journey undertaken first by steamer and then by rail  that sets in train a string of memories, long past and some long forgotten. Mrquez recollects his life from his childhood to his employment as a reporter in Bogota. 																								A substantial part of the memoirs is devoted to the depiction of the family that surrounded Mrquez: elderly and eccentric aunts, uncles and grandparents and an endless stream of Mrquez bastards. At the head is Colonel Mrquez, to whom nobody writes any more, a veteran of the Thousand Days War (between liberals and conservatives), who is very much the patriarch at the head of the table. The ambience is that of genteel decay and often of hardship heroically borne by Mrquezs mother, who is often abandoned by a husband trying to eke out a living as a homoeopathic pharmacist. But amidst all this, Gabriels education is never neglected and his coming of age is among the most hilarious and enjoyable parts of the book. Mrquez could invent magic realism because he lived it in his own life.																								It seems inevitable from Mrquezs childhood that he would end up being a writer. But this could also be the way memory retrospectively patterned the events of the past to give them a design. His poems make him a sort of a celebrity in school and at local festivals. His marvellous versions of family life earned him many admirers even when he was a child. 																								Mrquez is aware of the elusive and the fallible nature of memory. But he is also conscious of the importance of memory. He uses as the epigraph a statement which says that Life is not what one lived, but what one remembers and how one remembers it in order to recount it. The act of remembrance inevitably, if paradoxically, involves a certain amount of amnesia.																								It is easy to see from this book what made Mrquez into a writer. There was an inner demon  for the lack of a better word  which seems to have driven him. He believes with Rilke that If you think you are capable of living without writing, do not write. Mrquez is a compulsive and a compelling writer. In a sense, this goes without saying but it is rare to have this quality reflected in fiction and in autobiography.

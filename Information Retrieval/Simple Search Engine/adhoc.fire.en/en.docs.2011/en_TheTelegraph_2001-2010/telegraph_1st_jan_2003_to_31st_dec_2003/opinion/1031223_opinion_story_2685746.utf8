The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Tuesday, December 23, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Nobel intentions				 																																																				Sir  Ever since Amartya Sen won the economics Nobel, the West Bengal government has been trying to find ways to make use of his special insight. Sens Pratichi Trust has lately begun work on health in the Birbhum and Dumka districts of West Bengal and Jharkhand respectively (Improving but way to go, says Sen diagnosis, Dec 20). Some time last year, the state government had desired Sens advice on a human development report to be jointly prepared with the United Nations Development Programme. In the circumstances, Sen may hope that Pratichis health report will be received with as much enthusiasm as the one on education. But he should know that our state government only ever wants advice, it is another matter that the advice is never followed. The abysmal health infrastructure in cities in Bengal got unprecedented media coverage not long ago and much noise was made about the action that would be taken. But the results are for all to see. Only the gullible will believe that Pratichis reports will make a mark this time around.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,  Arunav Sinha, Calcutta
				 																Murder on the road				 																																																				Sir  The murder of Satyendra Dubey for exposing the corruption in the Golden Quadrilateral project, coming close on the heels of the dismissal of the states director general of police, D.P. Ojha, shows how murder, kidnappings and extortion have become rampant in Laloo Prasad Yadavs benami regime in Bihar. The message is loud and clear  Follow Laloos diktat or else. Such is the mafias grip over the state that all development work has come to a standstill and infrastructure and health care are in a shambles. No wonder, Biharis are taunted outside the state.				 																																																				But Yadav has the full support of the secular brigade in the metros. Ever since he stopped L.K. Advanis rath and arrested the saffron leader in 1992, he has became a secular icon. They have continued to support him when he became involved in one scam after another, and even when he put up his wife as his substitute in Bihar. Yadav maintains a firm grip over the state administration, often attending cabinet meetings. Since the days of Sanjay Gandhi, India has not seen such blatant exercise of extra-constitutional authority.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Bihar, the birth-place of Buddha and Mahavir, has become lawless. It is now a place where merit and honesty have no relevance. The state government may brush aside recent incidents like the murder of Satyendra Dubey and the violence against jobseekers from outside the state, but these incidents will definitely push Bihar further back. As it is, law and order conditions have affected the growth of industries. The per capita income of the state is abysmal, while the ever-increasing population and unemployment continue to be intractable problems. The state government blames the Centre for being partial in its allocation of funds. But what has it done to check the mafia who have stalled the Bihar stretch of the highways project which would benefit the people of the state?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ashwini Kumar Lal, New Delhi

				 																																																				Sir  The killing of Satyendra Dubey, an Indian Institute of Technology alumnus, has shocked IIT-ans, past and present, beyond belief (IIT tribute to highway martyr, Dec 13). In order to fight this crime, we have launched a website. Needless to say, we have found overwhelming support from Indians all over the world.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Naveen, via email

				 																																																				Sir  The murder of Satyendra Dubey and the lackadaisical manner in which it is being investigated by the Rabri Devi government may result in work on the Bihar segment of the ambitious Golden Quadrilateral project being abandoned. With the general elections in mind, the Bharatiya Janata Party has deputed the architects of its recent victory, Arun Jaitley and Pramod Mahajan, to Bihar. The Congress too must distance itself from Laloo Prasad Yadav. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

				 																																																				Sir  In his letter to the prime minister, Satyendra Dubey had revealed how the local mafia was making crores by using poor quality construction materials. He had pleaded for secrecy, fearing a danger to his life. But care was not taken to keep his identity a secret and the talented 31-year-old IIT Kanpur graduate was shot. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully, 																															
Arkadeep Mitra, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  Most politicians in our country consider bureaucrats to be their personal servants and expect them to obey even grossly illegal orders if the latter want promotions. Despite their education, special training in government administration and experience, most officers in the administrative and police services must be servile to politicians. This is what has resulted in the numerous scams. The dismissed DGP, D.P. Ojha, had brought a very serious charge against the Rashtriya Janata Dal member of Parliament, Mohammad Shahabuddin, and the allegation should have been duly investigated. Sadly, Laloo Prasad Yadav decided to peremptorily sack the officer. This shows how unreasonable the states rulers are. 				 																																																				Reportedly, Ojha now faces a threat to his life; the Centre should provide him adequate security, failing which he might meet the same fate as Satyendra Dubey. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

				 																																																				Sir  The D.P. Ojha case shows, once again, that Bihar is run in a dictatorial fashion by Laloo Yadav. The former chief minister sacked Ojha for violating service rules and openly criticizing politicians. In the circumstances, Ojha has done well to go public on the real reasons for his dismissal. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Anupam Roy Chowdhury, Gokarna, Murshidabad

				 																																																				Sir  As proved by the recent incidences of violence in the state, Laloo Yadavs lathi rallies have not done anything for Bihar. Politicians are plundering the states treasury  the fodder scam, in which Yadav is the prime accused, is an example of this. Instead of shedding crocodile tears for Jharkhandis, as he did at the December 14 rally in Ranchi, Laloo Yadav should try to serve the people of Bihar.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Manoranjan Das, Jamshedpur

Athletes who have been identified by their international federation or national anti-doping organization for inclusion in an out-of-competition testing location pool shall provide accurate, current location information. The national anti-doping organization shall be responsible for collecting this information and submitting it to the World Anti-Doping Agency. WADA shall make this information accessible to other anti-doping organizations having competence to test the athlete...This information shall be maintained in strict confidence at all times and shall be used exclusively for purposes of planning, coordinating or conduction testing.																								...Anti-doping organizations shall, at least annually, publish publicly a general statistical report of their doping control activities with a copy provided to WADA.																								...WADA shall act as a central clearing house for all doping control testing data and results, and shall make this information accessible to the athlete, the athletes national federation, national Olympic committee or national paralympic committee, national anti-doping organization, international federation, and the International Olympic Committee or the International Paralympic Committee. WADA shall, at least annually, publish statistical reports summarizing such information. To avoid unnecessary duplication in testing by the various anti-doping organizations with authority to test an athlete, each anti-doping organization with the authority to test an athlete shall report all out-of-competition tests to WADA clearing house promptly after such tests have been conducted, and WADA shall make this information accessible to all other anti-doping organizations with the authority to test the athlete.																								...The collection of samples for doping control does and should take place at both international and national events.

At national events, the collection of in-competition doping control samples shall be initiated and directed by the designated national anti-doping organization of that country.																								Out-of-competition testing is and should be initiated and directed by both international and national organizations. Out-of-competition testing may be initiated and directed by WADA; the IOC or IPC prior to the Olympic Games or Paralympic Games; the athletes international federation; the athletes national anti-doping organization; or the national anti- doping organization of any country where the athlete is present.

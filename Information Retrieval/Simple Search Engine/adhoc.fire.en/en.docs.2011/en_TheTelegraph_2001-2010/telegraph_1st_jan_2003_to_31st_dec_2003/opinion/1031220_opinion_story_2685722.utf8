		 Saturday, December 20, 2003 				 DOING NOTHING IS HARD WORK
 THIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT  SINGH				 	 Victory is a heady punch																								I spent my childhood and youth shirking work by bunking school and college lectures. But for the fear of parents and teachers, I had no problem spending my days playing and loafing about. That attitude to life continued into the years in office. I found excuses to absent myself, roamed the streets gazing into shop-windows, at the raunaq of bazaars, at people going from nowhere to nowhere. I looked forward to weekends and holidays. If the office closed down in honour of the demise of some national leader or departmental head, picnic. My role model was a loafer.																								Things began to change when I became my own employer and had to live on what I earned by my own efforts. I proved to be a hard task-master. Painful though the transition was, I learnt to rise before dawn, slog all day into the late hours and cut down on my social activities. Slogging became second nature. I lost the ability to relax, to sit still and stare at nothing without a care in the world. 																								I cant make up my mind whether it is better to be a loafer or a workaholic. Since I am determined not to drive myself hard anymore, I am trying out different techniques to teach myself to do nothing.																								I sit in my garden basking in the winter sun. I keep my habit of picking up a book or a magazine under check. I succumb to crossword puzzles because they keep my mind from going to sleep. I watch my cats (theyve multiplied to six). They spend their days doing nothing besides playing with each other and dozing off. I envy their care-free existence. They can do so because they live on my bounty. 																								Envying cats does not solve my problems. I have eliminated some causes of my restlessness and come to the conclusion that both the impulse to restless activity and the desire to do nothing ultimately depend on ones mind. How can one train the mind?																								Very reluctantly I turned to meditation. I did my best to keep the outside world from intruding into my solitude. I read the morning papers and watched TV to keep abreast of world events. Then put the world out of my mind. 																								I tried some preliminary exercises like shutting my eyes and focusing my mind on inhaling and exhaling my breath. I found it very soothing. For a few fleeting seconds, I could also still my mind and prevent it from jumping like a monkey from one branch to another. It didnt last too long. The mind is simian: it is its nature to jump about. It continues to do so when I am asleep. I cannot control my dreams because I cannot control my mind except for a few fleeting moments.																								In any event what does stilling my mind produce? Some maintain it produces peace of mind  which in its turn produces nothing besides peace of mind. I am in a conundrum: should I persist in trying to meditate? Or should I give it up as an exercise in futility? I wish some reader knowledgeable about the subject would advise me. In praise of Bacchus																								Though I live the life of a recluse in self-imposed sanyas from dawn to dusk, I have quite a mehfil every other evening to join me in my sundowner. I am myself baffled at the variety of people who descend on me. 																								One evening I had Habib Jung Nawab of Paiga. He is a product of Cambridge University who has taken to tableegh  preaching Islam. He has now opted out of worldly pursuits, taken on the title Faqir Baba, and spends his days and nights in prayer in his home in Jubilee Hills, Hyderabad. 																								While we were discussing religious topics, in walked Bhola with two prostitutes and two hijdas to inform me of the problems they had to face with the police and in getting admission for their children in schools. Nawab Habib Jung was more baffled than I. You do get the oddest of visitors, I must say, he said as he left.																								Another evening I had Bhanumati Fresa (nee Pillai) whose hospitality I had enjoyed in Rome many times. She has now taken over the management of her husband, Professor Carlo Fresas vineyard in Mont Pulchiano, some 70 miles outside Rome. I have also stayed there with the Fresas and their children, son Siddharth, daughter Gaya and their dogs. 																								I was asking Bhano about the kinds of vines she grows, how long it takes them to bear fruit and how long the fruit lasts. While we were discussing vintage wines, in walked Narinder Sawhney, his wife Jasmine Kaur, their daughter and son-in-law. The Sawhneys are now British citizens but visit India and Pakistan every year on pilgrimage to Sikh shrines in the two countries. 																								Their life story reads like fiction. The family is from Chattwal (now in Pakistan). They migrated to India in 1947. Narinder Singh took a degree in engineering before migrating to England. He could not get a suitable job and joined The Wines and Spirits Academy and picked up the business of liquors from A to Z. He bought a liquor vend, The Nest, in Hanwell not far from Londons Heathrow Airport. He expanded it to the largest liquor vend in the country, specializing in the rarest of the rare malt whiskeys, rum, vodka and French wines. He sold The Nest at considerable profit and set up The Whiskey Exchange, specializing in marketing rare liquors not commonly available.																								Bhanu Fresa and Narinder Sawhney exchanged business cards and invited each other to their homes in Pulchiano and London. The Sawhneys are teetotallers (at least in my home): Bhano took a slug of Scotch neat. However, the mehfil was devoted to the praise of Bacchus, the god of wine. May the prohibitionists rest in hell! Two for Mammon																								Money is not god, but by god																								Its not less than god. As he kissed the wads of notes  with his forehead And piled them beside him worshipfully																								He seemed to toll the bells for BJP																								But like the vice in a black comedy The bard of the wild card, the  bachelor of jugglery																								Pat comes Jogi																								Biting an over-indulgent mother																								Slighting decency, insulting democracy And thereby delighting the saffron  lobby For the apparent equality achieved  by the Congress																								With their party.																								Judeo is vindicated. Indeed! For the money received on the  TV for all to see																								Is no bribery And whereas Tehelka and all were  wrong																								Sting operation this is justified entirely And there is no double standard,  no hypocrisy!																								But theres nothing to worry																								If they join together																								Judeo and Jogi																								Can conquer any country.

 - Indian foreign policy is too preoccupied with Pakistan and  the US  J.N. Dixit The author is former foreign secretary  of India Shared values The last week of November witnessed  important meetings between leaders of the European Union  and the government of India, a major event following the  Indo-European summit to which the prime minister, Atal Bihari  Vajpayee, went last year. The president of the European  Commission (former prime minister of Italy), Romano Prodi,  and the commissioner for foreign relations, Chris Patten,  visited India. The Italian prime minister, who is the current  president of the European Union, Silvio Berlusconi, was  also supposed to visit India but had to cancel it due to  health reasons. Prodi and Patten had not only high-level  discussions with the top leaders of the government of India,  but also interacted with apex-level think-tanks and business  organizations like the Confederation of Indian Industry  and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. In a message for this occasion  of Indo-European dialogue, Berlusconi asserted that relations  between India and Europe are based on shared values. He  went on to state that this expanding relationship is because  of better communications and knowledge regarding each other,  resulting in substantive contacts in the sphere of economy,  culture, tourism, development cooperation, science and technology.  He concluded by stating that India is a primary partner  of the EU, both politically and economically. Romano Prodi  in his assessment stated that Indias image in Europe is  changing towards that of a dynamic trail-blazer in the knowledge-based  economy. Europe invites India to work with it to develop  a vision of how they can bring together the collective intellectual  capacities, entrepreneurial abilities, enhanced mutual prosperity  and cooperation. On all counts, Indo-European relations  have stabilized and are developing on positive lines. Whatever  assertions there may be about the world having become unipolar  with the United States of America as the central prism,  the accompanying reality is that of there being other centres  of political and economic importance. Europe collectively  is such a centre. With the enhanced membership of the European  Union which would consist of 25 members, in the near future,  Europe is becoming a collective political and economic entity  matching India in territorial size. It has a large market  for Indian exports and is a source for investment and technological  inputs into the Indian economy. Europe is an important political  and strategic factor influencing international power equations,  affecting major international political and economic developments.  The membership of the countries of the EU in the United  Nations and other multilateral fora makes it a desirable  partner to cultivate (for India) in influencing many dimensions  of collective international cooperation in the spheres of  security, development and globalization.  The integration of Europe has  valuable lessons for India in strengthening regional cooperation  in south Asia, despite the tense relationships between India  and Pakistan. It is interesting that Chris Patten, in one  of his addresses in New Delhi (on November 28), said tongue-in-cheek  that India-Pakistan relations could not be worse than those  between Germany and France for nearly a hundred years. So  there is no need to despair much about slow progress in  south Asian regional cooperation. Formal relations between India  and the EU began in 1963, India being one of the first developing  countries to set up separate diplomatic relations with the  European Economic Community, the Indian Ambassador in Belgium  being given separate accreditation to the EEC. In 1968,  the European monetary system was created, in 1973 a single  market, and in 1993 a single currency arrangement for the  whole of Europe. From 1999, Indias relations with the EEC  expanded, parallel to these developments. Regular annual discussions between  the European presidency and the government of India commenced  from 1992. The arrangement got institutionalized at the  apex level with annual Indo-Europe summits being held from  2000. High-level discussions between the government of India  and the EU officials became more intense from the beginning  of 2002. From the beginning of 2002 to the middle of 2003,  the European commissioners for enterprise and information,  development of humanitarian aid, the commissioner for external  Relations and the EU high representative for common foreign  and security policy have visited India. This was followed  by the visit by the European commissioner for trade, and  culminated in this latest November visit of Prodi and Patten. In the political sphere, there  is parallelism and convergence of policy orientations between  India and Europe  the belief in democracy, human rights,  pluralism in civil societies, liberty, having independent  media and judiciary, shared between Europe and India as  a corner stone for a stable world order. As far as the phenomenon  of political and military unilateralism characterizing conflict-management  by the US goes, India and Europe have the shared conviction  that this should be replaced by effective multilateral ar-  rangements under the umbrella of the UN. India and Europe  are strongly opposed to terrorism, subversion and secessionist  forces threatening state structures and civil societies.  Both also believe in the management and resolution of conflict  through peaceful means. This has resulted in growing political  relations within the frame-work of what the EU secretariat  considers a strong and institutional architecture manifested  in consultations at various levels from the summit to ministerial  meetings, joint commissions, exchange of parliamentary delegations  and so on. Countries of the EU are Indias  largest trading partner. Bilateral trade has increased to  more than twice of what it was in 1990-91. The current volume  of bilateral trade is 25 billion euros, which is likely  to increase to 35 billion by the year 2005 and 50 billion  by the year 2008. Europe is also the largest source for  foreign direct investment into India at present. Economic, particularly commercial,  transactions between India and Europe account for 25 per  cent of Indias foreign trade. EU investments in India have  increased from 78 million euros in 1991 to four billion  in the year 2003-2004. These investments are particularly  important because most of the investment-flows have been  in the infrastructure sector of Indias economy, namely,  power, oil-refineries, telecommunications and transport  sectors. The European Commission has agreed to provide resources  to India for making elementary education universal, and  for building human capital and rural development as well  as natural resources. India and Europe are also engaged  in a cooperation programme to strengthen civil aviation  structures and maritime transport activities. This would  include civil air-safety, airlines management, air-traffic  management and the building and maintenance of airports.  The maritime transport cooperation project has as its objective  the improvement of the efficiency of Indian ports and for  building electronic data interchange for the port trusts,  particularly those of Mumbai, Chennai and Tuticorin. Similar cooperation agreements  have been signed in the spheres of science and technology  based on the complementarity of needs. The European community,  at present, is engaged in nearly 55 research projects with  Indian partners, focused on agriculture, environment, utilization  of natural resources and information technology. India is  also the largest receiver in Asia of non-governmental funds  from the EU. These funds are generated for tribal empowerment  projects, educational projects, income generation projects  and food security projects. There are two important issues  on which there are some differences between the EU and India.  The first is related to nuclear non-proliferation. Although  the controversies of 1998 and 1999 have died down, there  are reservations about Indias nuclear weaponization in  Europe. The second issue is the differences of opinion on  the management of international trade under the World Trade  Organization. Senior figures from the EU have expressed  the view that India and Brazil took particularly negative  stands at Doha and Cancun. There seems to be some lack of  understanding of the social and economic compulsions under  which India has to adjust to the process of globalization.  One hopes that the continuous interaction between the EU  and India on this particular issue will temper the differences,  even if there is no complete agreement. Indias foreign policy seems preoccupied  with relations with the US, with China and with Pakistan,  and with security issues related to Indias proximate and  extended neighbourhood. What one has to keep in mind is  that a good relationship with Europe provides an important  equation in the long-term to further Indias interests.

		 Friday, October 10, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																Blue and black in BolognaAlmost blue (Harvill,   5.80) by Carlo Lucarelli is Oonagh Stranskys  flawless translation of a modern Italian psychological thriller.  Lucarelli hosts a popular TV series which examines unsettling  and unsolved crimes and the cities in which they occur.  This novel is set in Bologna, where a number of young students  are being gruesomely murdered. Inspector Negro is on the  trail of this assassino seriale, and her chief witness  is a blind man, Simone, who eavesdrops on the noises of  Bologna with his hypersensitive scanner  a sort of auditory  Rear Window. Running through this piece of postmodern  European noir is Simones favourite track, Chet Baker  singing Almost Blue  Almost blue, almost doing things  we used to do. Witness to partition: a memoir  (Rupa, Rs 250) by B.R. Nanda is a reprint,  freshly introduced by the author of Punjab Uprooted,  pseudonymously published in 1948. This monograph was written  in December 1947 at Ferozepur, a border town on the then  newly-created frontier between India and Pakistan. It is  a veteran historians early attempt to make sense of his  own experience of a historical catastrophe: I was mainly  concerned with what had happened in the Punjab, but the  epicentre of the political earthquake was not in Lahore,  but in London, where the fateful decision for the partition  of India was taken, and that decision itself was the outcome  of, what Gandhi once described, three mighty conflicting  forces of British imperialism, Congress nationalism and  Muslim separatism. The Fairy Gunmother (Rupa,  Rs 295) by Daniel Pennac is Ian Monks translation  of a French thriller set in Pariss Belleville quarter.  A policeman is shot dead at point-blank range by a sweet  old granny on a frosty morning. The neighbourhood is already  in an uproar because half a dozen more sweet old grannies  have been found with their throats slit. The sleuth is Benjamin  Malaussne, with his many dependent siblings, their scatty  mother, his epileptic dog and his journalist lover. Awara (Penguin, Rs 275)  by Gayatri Chatterjee is the reissue of a 1992 study  of Raj Kapoors classic film, released in 1951. Chatterjee  seeks to place Kapoors film in its historical, social and  political contexts, and closely reads a number of key sequences  and the soundtrack (Shanker Jaikishens music) to break  down the traditional academic divide between art and popular  cinema. She relates the question of problematic manhood  to postcolonial modernity.

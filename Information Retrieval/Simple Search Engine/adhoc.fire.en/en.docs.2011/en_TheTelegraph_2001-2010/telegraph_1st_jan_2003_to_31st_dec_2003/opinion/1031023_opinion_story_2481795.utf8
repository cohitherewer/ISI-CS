		 Thursday, October 23, 2003  BEAUTY BY BANNING
 Calcutta, with its teeming poor and  unhindered rallies, is still more humane than fast and beautified  Bangalore, argues Janaki Nair The author is a senior fellow in history,  Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta Out of bounds  Returning to Bangalore via  Hyderabad after a continuous four-month stay at Calcutta  was without doubt a revelatory experience. Passage through  the city of Hyderabad has been eased by innumerable flyovers,  and the floors of the intercity bus station were clean enough  to sleep on. The e-Seva offices were brimming with smiling  assistants and grateful citizens paying bills and applying  for passports. In Bangalore, which always appears cleaner,  newer and far greener than most other Indian cities, I was  told of the recent introduction of the zero tolerance zone  in the central business area, around Mahatma Gandhi Road.  Double-parking and crossing the yellow line were strictly  disallowed. Lights had to be dimmed, and vehicles had to  remain silent in this zone, with vehicular emissions reduced  to a minimum. It appears as if S.M. Krishnas 1999 promise  of turning Bangalore into Singapore is being realized at  last, and in equally authoritarian ways, if only, as he  quickly added with blameless pragmatism, in strips.  The citys bourgeoisie could now  get to work or enjoy its shopping without being interrupted  by any untidy signs of plebeian democracy. Over the past  decade or so, the same time that Bangalore gained its national  and international status as the ideal destination of the  information technology industry, the city has quietly moved  towards a new municipal order that will surely be the envy  of those despairing over the deteriorating state of their  metros, Calcutta included.  The programme of Beauty by banning  had the Bangalore Urban Arts Commission as its strongest  advocate. The cause was however widely taken up by the middle  class with a number of important consequences. Rallies and  demonstrations once held in and around the Cubbon Park   on the edge of which is the seat of legislative power   have been banned, and the park has been fenced to promote  recreational activities. Vidhana Soudha itself is now out  of bounds to all but bureaucrats, ministers and their supplicants.  And the new parastatal agency, the Bangalore Agenda Task  Force, headed by the Infosys leader, Nandan Nilekani, oversees  the new face of the city. All this without too much fuss  or struggle from denizens or even the politicians of Bangalore  itself.  Bangalores pet peeve continues  to be the scandalous state of its roads, with the citys  entrepreneurs continuously having to hear complaints about  the difference between Oxford Street and MG Road. Yet the  English press in Calcutta has been recently overwhelmed  by the controversy over whether Amitava Lalas was an appropriate  response to the innumerable rallies and processions which  place intolerable strain on the citys everyday life. Between  the stubbornness of anti-rallyists and the steadfast determination  of politicians to prevent any infringement of their democratic  freedom, there appears no room for discussing why some cities  like Bangalore may well be on their way to a successful  Singaporization, while Calcutta appears doomed. There is  even less room for a discussion on whether Singapore is  a desirable ideal, even in strips, and what the costs  of its achievement may be. For one, the demographic profile  of Bangalore, which is overwhelmingly middle class, has  amply enabled this singular passage. More important, the  absence of the smoke-stack stage of industrialization has  meant that neither the city skyline nor the sidewalks are  littered with marks of an old industrial order  no dark  satanic mills, no underemployed masses.  Most important, the new municipal  policy has revealed exactly whose illegalities are tolerated  and whose are not in this city of nearly 6 million. Areas  in the central zone of the city have been cleared of slums  and the inhabitants moved to the peripheries of the city.  The familiar Bangalore transport service buses, formerly  red and silver, were painted blue in an effort to erase  any unfortunate associations with an angry leftist red.  Neither the number nor frequency of the buses has been increased  in a city which is more dependent on automobiles. Sidewalks  have been torn up and converted into parking lots for millions  of two and four wheelers, while the illegal use of basements  for shops and restaurants, rather than for parking, is being  tolerated. Meanwhile, many middle-class homes have, with  impunity, occupied and even fenced in stretches in front  of their home to enhance the image of the garden city.  Robust middle-class residents associations ensure standards  of hygiene and cleanliness, and have even privatized public  parks for their exclusive use. The programme of beauty by banning  has won its battles, but the slow, steady enclosure of  the commons and intensified privatization of public space  have gone uncontested. With its new ring road, moreover,  Bangalore has been successfully transformed into a place  to move through with an unhindered pace. The complete self-absorption  of the motorist was revealed when a young girl was run over  at an intersection, and a few cars passed over her before  it was realized that she was not another stray dog. The slow, grinding pace of life  in an unreconstructed Calcutta would not tolerate such brutal  inhumanities. It is the only city I know where bus drivers  roundly curse cars that block their passage with the epithet,Private!  It is the only city where bus conductors are scrupulous  about returning the smallest change, and are polite even  in the most trying heat, crowd and noise. The political  culture of disruption and chaos, over which there is so  much fretting, is the same one that has allowed its residents  to enjoy the perquisites of cheap living. Free water supply  is an unheard-of luxury in any metro of comparable size.  These cultures have also kept  wages, bus fares, and sundry other everyday costs absurdly  low. While in Bangalore (and Hyderabad), the hegemony of  the middle classes has been consolidated around the promise  of greater social mobility, such a class in Calcutta, though  ascendant, vocal and bitter, is far outnumbered by the sheer  numbers of the urban and rural poor to whom the political  parties owe their career. Their opposition to the ban on  rallies and processions is not because they think it will  promote the wellbeing of the poor. It is rather a recognition  that in a deeply segmented social order such as ours, the  singular will of the middle class cannot be allowed to easily  triumph over plebeian democracy. The sufferings of the Indian  middle class, even in a city like Calcutta, will never match  the sufferings of the urban dispossessed. And we might well  ask of these two very different cities, Bangalore and Calcutta:  in which does the rule of law prevail and in which the  reign of terror?

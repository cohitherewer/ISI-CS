		 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 FEELING GOOD
																								The finishing, and all important, touch to the feelgood factor being experienced by most Indians was provided by the Indian cricket team on Tuesday morning. There is, perhaps, a coincidental correlation between the pride of Indians and the performance of the Indian cricket team. In 1971, Indias first ever victory over England on English soil came a few months before its military triumphs against Pakistan. In 2003, the good performance of the Indian economy and the recognition that India has arrived as a global economic power coincide with Indias win over Australia on Australian soil. The win at Adelaide comes after two decades: India last defeated the Aussies on the latters home turf in 1981 at Melbourne. Apart from the rarity factor, there is something very special about the win that the Indian team registered. For one thing, the Indian eleven defeated a side which is acknowledged to be the world champion. An Australian side, even without the principal bowlers, is a formidable combination. Before the tour began, the Indian team was written off as being worse than the underdog. Even in the Adelaide test match, during the Australian first innings, the Indian bowling and fielding looked scrappy and below par. That impression was strengthened when the Indians batted and lost the top half of their batting with virtually nothing on the scoreboard. At that point of time, it appeared to be a familiar story: India following on and then losing. Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman, with two innings as good as any ever seen in a test match, placed India in a fighting position.																								The outcome of the Adelaide test demonstrated the truth of the old cricketing adage: catches win matches. Not only did the Indian team hold on to the catches, but it also held some memorable ones. Dravids flying catch at first slip to dismiss Damien Martyn was unforgettable. This, together with a magical spell of bowling from Ajit Agarkar, boosted the morale of the Indian team and turned the match. The Australians were outplayed in every department of the game. To use the words of an English general, Twas a famous victory.																								Cricket is arguably the only activity around which all Indians are united. Across the country and even among Indians who live abroad, the achievements of the Indian cricket team are followed closely and with pride. Within India, people forget their political, social and economic divisions, and support the Indian team in unison. This bestows on cricket a significance that is not quite there for other games or in any other public activity. The triumphs of the Indian cricket team, probably because they are so few and far between, have become the last resort of Indian patriotism. Cricket and the economy have come together to make Indians proud. They can now hold their head high with some justification. Sourav Ganguly and his boys, completely unwittingly, may have provided Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his election managers with a new rallying cry for the polls. Unintended consequences are often the most important factors in the making of history.

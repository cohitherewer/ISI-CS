 P.S.M. RAO																								The finance minister, Jaswant Singh, recently announced his governments plans to raise the gross national contentment, stressing the need to usher in a second green revolution. But his governments track record betrays a lack of seriousness in the vital sector of agriculture. If the neglect persists, controlling the damage to the economy and the discontent of the people might become impossible. 																								Two-thirds of the one billion Indians depend on agriculture to make a living. During the first five-year plan, the government recognized this and prioritized agriculture over everything else. The good results that followed resulted in complacence and the subsequent neglect of agriculture. The excessive dependence on import during the Sixties forced the government to look for an alternative strategy. When foodstocks depleted to a low of two-weeks requirement in 1967, and the fair weather friends  the foreign governments  refused to come to the rescue, the government had a tough time importing 11 million tonnes of foodgrains. That is when the importance of self-sufficiency in agriculture dawned on the government. The result was the green revolution.																								In retrospect, the green revolution did not help all the states, nor all sections of the population. All crops did not register increase in production either, which meant a balanced diet for all Indians was still a distant dream.  Dismal picture																								Several anomalies in food production have come to light recently. Public investment in agriculture has decelerated over the Nineties. Consequently, growth in foodgrain production declined to 1.7 per cent between 1990-96, lower than the population growth of 1.9 per cent. The overall growth in gross agricultural domestic product during 1990-2001 was lower, at 3.7 per cent, than the 4.2 per cent increase during the Eighties.																								Despite the foodstocks being three times larger than the buffer stock norm, hunger still rules in several parts of the country. Added to this is malnutrition or under-nutrition, that is, want of a balanced diet. 																								The three key problem areas, therefore, are food production, building up stocks and distribution to the people. All these need governmental support, which is easier to obtain in developed countries than in a developing country like ours. For instance, nine lakh farmers in the United States of America get an annual subsidy of $26 billion, while the $1 billion worth of subsidies that Indian farmers get is at a rate lower even than the World Trade Organization limit.  Act now																								Also, 25 per cent of productive land is not being cultivated. In some states, the figure is 30 per cent or more. The best farming practices to optimize yield are not adopted. Expenditure in research and development on agriculture is a poor 0.5 per cent of the gross domestic product against the expected one per cent. Proper extension network is absent and the input supply is abysmally low. Agricultural credit, although mandated to be at 18 per cent of the total commercial bank lending, is no more than half of this stipulation. The prime ministers directive to supply crop loans of up to Rs 50,000 at 9 per cent remains unimplemented. 																								It is therefore time for a re-think on the agricultural policy in India. Consolidating the system of minimum support price for farmers; raising employment opportunities; increasing the productivity of land; putting in place a support system of input supply, including credit; stepping up extension work and support to allied sectors like dairy are some of the important ingredients of a comprehensive agricultural policy. 																								None of these aspects is new, but they need to be worked on seriously. The policy should protect Indian interest from global forces, which could harm domestic agriculture. When developed countries are protecting their agriculture at all costs, poor nations cannot survive if they do not protect theirs. Agriculture is one area on which there can be no compromise. As former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru once observed, every thing else can wait, but not agriculture.

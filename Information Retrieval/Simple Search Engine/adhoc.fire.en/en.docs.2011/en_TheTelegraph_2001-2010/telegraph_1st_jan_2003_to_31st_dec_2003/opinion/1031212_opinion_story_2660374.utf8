 Srinivasan Subramanian																								The Outcaste: Akkarmashi By Sharankumar Limbale, Oxford, Rs 195																								One of the major impediments in Indias development has been the caste system, which has provided an excuse for the basest of atrocities on man. Seldom have the lives of these marginalized people found expression through literature and when it did, it was rarely an effective portrayal of their subhuman existence. This autobiography of Sharankumar Limbale, a an eminent writer of the Dalit movement, is a window to this world.																								In Marathi, akkarmashi means an outcaste and an illegitimate child  both of which describe the author. The product of a liaison between a high caste father and a Dalit mother, the illegitimacy of his begetting is a theme that runs through the book. As a consequence of his birth, Limbale was unacceptable among the higher castes to which his father belonged and a misfit among the lower castes, who nurtured him. But more than being a story of marginalization from society, this is one of hunger caused by such marginalization. 																								Limbale begins the narrative with his boyhood in a village in Maharastra, among people who made a menial living on the fringes of society. His untouchable status which touches all aspects of his life. Limbale raises several important social issues  that of oppression, caste discrimination and religious intolerance. There are characters in the narrative who personify each of these issues. One of them is Dada, a Muslim, who lives with the authors grandmother. 																								The machinations that make such outrageous oppression of Dalits possible in society are saddening. For instance, Hanmanta Limbale, the authors biological father and a higher caste Patil, attempts to barter his mistress to a friend for a night in the presence of his son. The author can only express an impotent fury at such oppression and question the morality of society. For example, the practice of high caste men taking up mistresses from the Dalit community, which is in contrast with the practice of untouchability. 																								Limbales musings are always erudite and more often than not in fine taste; and his portrayal characters and events, vivid and stark. But what make the book special are the instances of touching humanness and compassion that lighten even the most trying circumstances. The most endearing of these is the authors grandmother, Santamai, who brings him up and educates him.																								The book can be criticized for its sketchy chronology of events, and the fact that its numerous characters are often not even introduced. In a way, this heightens the despair of the narrative. This make the book into something of a montage of events and characters. 																								The book has a wonderful introduction by G.N. Devy, which provides an effective backdrop to the Dalit problem. This is a must read for all those interested in the caste question in India.						SRINIVASAN SUBRAMANIAN

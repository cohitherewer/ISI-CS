		 Saturday, December 27, 2003 				 WORLD BY US
																								The emergence of the US as the worlds only military power and most powerful economic player is blazoned all over the events of 2003																								The strains of Auld Lang Syne at the year-end will only remind most people that there will be very little to remember with pleasure about the year 2003. The most important event of the year was the invasion of Iraq by the United States of America. At the end of the year, the campaign was crowned by the capture of Mr Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi tyrant, in a hole near his hometown. The most powerful images of the year have been those connected with the Iraq war: the shock and the awe of the aerial bombardment; the fall of Baghdad; scenes of jubilation in Iraq; and the bringing down of Mr Husseins statue in the Iraqi capital. In a global view, this was the year when the stars and stripes fluttered proudly and the dominance of the US in world affairs was affirmed beyond doubt, if with occasional and irrelevant expressions of disapproval. The triumphalism of the US, especially of the Bush administration, has come with a price: the loss of lives. But the sight of body bags, a potentially dangerous phenomenon, was overshadowed by the picture of the bearded and helpless Mr Hussein captured by US troops.																								This year has belied those prophecies which had predicted that Iraq would become another Vietnam for the US, and the battle against terrorism would become self-defeating. The capture of Mr Hussein marks the victory of the US, it remains for the latter to win the peace as well. The Bush administration has reiterated that it will fight and defeat evil wherever evil is found. The definition of evil is, of course, completely left to US perceptions and US interests. Much to Indias dismay, for example, Pakistans sponsorship of cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir has brought forth no response, save words of warning, from Washington. Such double standards are minor irritants in a history subservient to one superpower.																								The success of the US forces in Iraq has obliterated in peoples minds the question regarding their presence in Iraq in the first place. The original argument that Mr Hussein had weapons of mass destruction has been proved to be a sham. As a consequence, what seems to have driven Mr George W. Bush and his close advisers was a bigger plan to redraw the west Asian chessboard. The redrawing was deemed to be necessary because of the mess left there in the train of British decolonization. Other than Israel, the US (read the West) has no reliable ally in the region. It thus has no bridgehead to move forward to combat Islamic fundamentalism, the new enemy after the demise of the Great Bear.																								In the course of the 20th century, world politics and international relations moved from balance of power to the Cold War. In the fin de sicle, global power revolves only on one axis. All other configurations, existing and potential, and all other interests have been rendered irrelevant by the emergence of the US as the worlds only military power and the worlds most powerful economic player. The rubric for at least the first half of this century is blazoned all over the events of 2003.

		 Monday, July 07, 2003 				 ARE WE READY FOR THE FLIP?
 GWYNNE DYER																								The World Meteorological Organization normally produces statistics-heavy reports at the end of the year, not news bulletins about todays weather. Its announcement on July 2 that the record extremes in weather being experienced globally this year are evidence that climate change is actually underway is therefore much more than just another salvo in the long argument about global warming.																								In Geneva, where the WMO is based, daytime temperatures have not fallen below 25 degree Celsius since late May  the hottest June in at least 250 years. In the United States of America, May brought a record of 562 tornadoes (the previous record for one month was 399). In India, the pre-monsoon heat-wave brought peak temperatures of 45C and directly caused at least 1,400 deaths. As the WMO statement cautiously observed: New record extreme events occur everywhere somewhere in the globe, but in recent years the number of such extremes has been increasing. But there is still no sense of urgency, and hardly anybody addresses the real context of this change.																								The problem is that global warming was the first aspect of climate change to catch the publics attention, and for the vast majority of people it remains the only threat  if indeed it is a threat. After all, warmer isnt necessarily worse, and it is a gradual process and we will all probably be safely dead before it gets too serious. Climate researchers have known that this is untrue for about 20 years, since the evidence of the Greenland ice-cores became available, but it has still not affected the public debate.																								Real change																								Those cores go down two miles into the Greenland ice-cap and bring up year-by-year evidence of weather that goes back a quarter-million years. What the shocked researchers realized when they examined the cores is that climate change  real climate change  is not gradual at all. It is a threshold phenomenon, a sudden flip into a radically different state that may then persist for a very long time. The real danger we face is that gradual warming of the sort we are experiencing now will trigger a sudden cooling that could drop average global temperatures by 5C in 10 years.																								The sudden cooling and the accompanying droughts would destroy most of the agriculture that now sustains six billion of us, and at least 90 per cent of the human race would be killed by famine and war in a matter of a decade or so. These abrupt climate changes can herald the beginning of the next Ice Age, but climatic flips like this can also occur for lengthy periods even in the midst of warm-and-wet inter-glacial periods like the present.																								Nothing is gradual																								The process by which the climate flips is now fairly well understood. The trigger is a phase of gradual warming that, either through glacial melting or just more rainfall, increases the amount of fresh water on the ocean surface between Labrador, Greenland and Norway. This critical part of the North Atlantic is where the Gulf Streams water, having become salty and dense through evaporation, sinks to the bottom and flows back south  but if it is diluted by too much fresh water on the surface, it doesnt sink and the circuit is broken.																								The whole global climate suddenly flips into a cool, dry phase that can last for many centuries before warmer conditions return: there have been two such episodes, 12,500 years ago and 8,500 years ago, even since the end of the last Ice Age. Or the cool, dry phase could last for a hundred thousand years if other conditions, like the shape of the earths orbit and the tilt of its axis, have already put us on the brink of a new Ice Age.																								The flips of the past were caused by natural warming of one kind or another, but by adding man-made warming to the problem we are making it far more dangerous. We have built all of human civilization, and increased our population a thousandfold, since the last cool, dry episode. All of that is at risk if the climate flips, and yet the public debate is still all about gradual change.

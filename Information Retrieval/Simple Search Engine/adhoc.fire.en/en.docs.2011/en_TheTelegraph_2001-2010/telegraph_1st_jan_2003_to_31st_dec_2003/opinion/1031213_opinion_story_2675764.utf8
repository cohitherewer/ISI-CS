		 Saturday, December 13, 2003  A QUESTION OF HONOUR
 - The Naga insurgency has never quite enjoyed the attention  it deserves  Politics and play / Ramachandra  Guha ramguhavsnl.com Watching the Nagas  Since its birth, the Indian nation-state  has been challenged by rebellion and insurgency. In the  late Forties, it was the Communist Party of India, who launched  a countrywide insurrection claiming that the freedom we  got from the British was false (in their evocatively pernicious  slogan, Ye Azadi Jhoota hai!). In the Fifties,  it was the Dravidians of the South, who threatened to secede  in protest against Aryan domination. In the Sixties, it  was the Naxalities, who thought that they could do in India  what Mao and his colleagues had done in China. In the Seventies,  it was the JP Andolan, which brought social life to a standstill  in many states and compelled the most drastic of repressive  measures, namely, the Emergency. In the Eighties it was  the Assamese and the Sikhs, both of whom sought (like the  Tamils) freedom from exploitation by Delhi. In the Nineties,  it was the Kashmiris, large sections of whom have showed  their disaffection with Indian rule through the use of arson  and assassination. At their peak, these movements  all enjoyed widespread popular support. They dominated the  front pages of newspapers, and were each considered a threat  to the unity and integrity of India. But in the end, the  states patience and armed strength prevailed. The Communist  revolutionaries of the Forties forsook the gun for the ballot.  The Tamils and Sikhs were in time reconciled to being part  of India. Whether the Kashmiris will also follow this route  remains to be seen. In this column I wish to talk  of an insurgency that has been with us since the time of  Indian independence. Yet, because of its geographical location,  it has never quite got the attention it deserves. I refer, of course, to the Naga  rebellion. Strictly speaking, this predates independence.  In 1946 was formed the Naga National Council. This urged  the British not to hand the Nagas over to the Indians when  they left. The next year, a Naga delegation signed an agreement  with the governor of Assam, which protected their lands  and customs while agreeing to be part of India. The agreement  would run for ten years; the assumption, at any rate on  the Naga side, was that they would be free to decide afresh  whether they wished the agreement to continue, or whether  they would, instead, choose to become a separate nation-state. From the beginning, militant sections  among the Nagas wanted nothing to do with India. They organized  a boycott of the 1952 general elections, as well as a boycott  of a trip to the Naga Hills by the prime minister, Jawaharlal  Nehru. The radical leader, A. Z. Phizo, came to New Delhi,  but his talks failed on the question of independence (which  he claimed) versus autonomy (which the government  was willing to grant). Phizo went underground, and the insurgency  began. For the next decade, there were bitter battles between  the security forces and the Naga rebels. There were heavy  casualties on both sides, and much loss of civilian life. In 1960, Phizo escaped to London,  and made an impression on the British press. Stories were  printed about Indian atrocities. These alarmed Nehru,  who sought now to negotiate with the moderate Nagas. An  agreement was signed to establish a full-fledged state of  Nagaland  this a significant concession  since there were  less than half-a-million Nagas, whereas other states had  populations of 20 million and more. The compromise, however,  was resented and opposed by the extremists. And so the civil  war restarted, and, in fits and starts, has continued to  this day. The course of the Naga rebellion  has been deeply shaped by tribal loyalties. Many of the  early insurgents, like Phizo himself, were Angamis. The  Aos, on the other hand, were always more ready to talk to  the Indians. The Semas were divided-they had both radicals  and reformists in their ranks. More recently, the movement  has been taken over by Thangkul Nagas from Manipur. In the Sixties, Jayaprakash Narayan  travelled extensively in Nagaland. In 1965, he published  a pamphlet called Nagaland mein Shanti ka Prayas  (The Prospects for Peace in Nagaland) which bears re-reading  today. JP argued that there was a civilizational unity in  India which antedates its political unity. Even East and  West Pakistans shared in this unity  as he put it, wahan  ke Islam par bhi bharatiyata ka rang chad gaya hai  (their Islam is tinged with the colour of Indian-ness).  But the Nagas had not been influenced in the least by Indian  culture. They had a marked sense of separateness, this reinforced  by their recent conversion to Christianity. JPs investigations revealed that  it was the rebels who had fired the first shot back in 1954.  But the army were not slow to retaliate. And the counter-insurgency  operations had imposed great sufferings on innocent Nagas.  To build a road, or a barrack, or a landing strip, villages  upon villages were uprooted by the state. While recognizing the cultural  distinctiveness of the Nagas, JP nonetheless urged them  to be part of India. He met leaders of the underground,  and advised them to shed their arms and contest elections,  and thus take over the administration by peaceful means.  For, in the federal system, the states were free to design  and mould their own future. Foreign affairs and defence  were in the hands of the Centre, but the things that most  mattered  education, health, economic development  were  in the control of the states. The rebels chose not to hear JP.  The dream of an independent Nagaland continued to animate  them. In the next three decades, bouts of war were interspersed  with rounds of talks. In the late Eighties, the Swedish  journalist, Bertil Lintner, travelled in the Naga borderlands.  India may have its shortcomings and flaws, observed Lintner,  these often easy to detect and easier still to ridicule.  But it remains a strong democracy where criticism as a concept  is officially tolerated and the government flexible when  a situation demands it. The Nagaland press possesses an  extraordinary freedom which has no equivalent in any other  Asian war zone. The local press contained detailed reports  of rebel ambushes and even underground statements from both  the NNC and the NSCNsuch things would be unthinkable in  Burma. Lintner gave the rebels the same  advice as JP: to accept and deepen provincial autonomy.  As he put it, The Nagas in India have managed to get from  the Indian government exactly what Rangoon denies its national  minorities: a separate state with a high degree of self-government,  aid from the Centre and the right to preserve their own  customs and culture. JP could be seen simply as an  Indian do-gooder; but Lintner was an authority on insurgency  in southeast Asia. His words carried weight; and, at last,  they have apparently been listened to. For a couple of years  ago, the main rebel group, the National Socialist Council  of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), declared a ceasefire, and commenced  talks with New Delhi. No final agreement has yet been arrived  at, but there have been some significant attempts at reconciliation.  One such was the visit to India of the self-exiled leaders  of the movement, Isak Swu and T. Muivah. Another was the  recent visit to Nagaland of the Indian prime minister. Speaking at a public meeting in  Kohima, Atal Bihari Vajpayee offered the Nagas money and  work. The Centre, he said, would spend Rs 500 crore in the  state over the next two years, thus creating 25,000 new  jobs. This is welcome, but more than money, the Nagas want  honour. One suggestion, offered by the respected columnist,  B.G. Verghese, is for the Indian government to recognize  the states unique culture and history, by issuing passports  to Naga Indians. Some such gesture is called for, if only  to assure the young that the struggle and sacrifice of their  elders have not wholly been in vain.

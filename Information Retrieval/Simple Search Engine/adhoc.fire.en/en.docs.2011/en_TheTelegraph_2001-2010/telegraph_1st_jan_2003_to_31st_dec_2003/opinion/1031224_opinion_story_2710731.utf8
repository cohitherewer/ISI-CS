		 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 THEATRE OF THE SACRED
 Shobita Punja																								As Lithuanias ambassador to UNESCO explained so aptly  In 1972, when the World Heritage Convention was adopted, the world was still very Eurocentric and heritage was seen as just churches and castles. A first step towards a broader concept was the inclusion of natural landscapes. Today heritage is more people-oriented. And UNESCO for the first time awarded the title of masterpieces of oral and intangible heritage of humanity to 19 outstanding cultural spaces or forms of expression, and a list was published in May 2003.																								This list includes the Oruro Carnival of Bolivia which is a 10-day affair in which 30,000 dancers and musicians celebrate the Andean carnival before Lent. The fast-changing rural and tribal landscape, decline of agriculture, deforestation and migration threaten the culture of Oruro, and the entire carnival has been singled out, therefore, as an example of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity.																								From Japan, the entry that attained the title of masterpiece of oral and intangible heritage of humanity was the Nogaku theatre, which dates back to the eighth century and comprises of two types of drama: No theatre, in which the supernatural hero becomes human and tells a story, and Kyogen, with its comic dialogues in a language that was spoken in medieval times.																								The phrase, oral and intangible traditions, divides our heritage into two distinct aspects. Those traditions that are recorded in the literature of the past, like our Vaastu shastras and Upanishads, and all tangible heritage like our monuments, sculptures and paintings. Tangible means everything that occupies space and time, and can be touched, as it were. Intangible heritage encompasses all our performing arts, and all the ideas and skills that go into each performance.																								Our literary tradition is divided into the written word, in which we have our books and hand-written manuscripts of stories, myths, legends, poetry and drama. However, in India, while hardly 50 per cent of the population is said to be illiterate, the figure by no means suggests that the other 50 per cent is uncultured. Rather the opposite, for it is this 50 per cent of the people who hold the key to the intangible and oral traditions of our country and the secret to so many of our art forms. Words and spaces																								The oral tradition refers to whatever comes in the name of folklore, rhymes, riddles, songs, poetry, music, dance, puppetry, forms of story-telling and traditional knowledge systems that are handed down from one generation to the next by word of mouth, from father to son and grandmother to grand-daughter. Our country is one of the few exceptions in the world where the continuity of our crafts, arts, beliefs and skills has survived over centuries in different regions. Inherent in all material and man-made heritage is the ideational or intangible aspects of knowledge that have inspired creative expression. Intangible and oral traditions incorporate literally millions of aspects of our living heritage which are falling prey to urbanization, change in habitat or the destruction of a way of life that was more in tune with nature. 																								We welcome the 1998 UNESCO proclamation of masterpieces of oral and intangible heritage of humanity, the convention for safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage and the inclusion of the Kuttiyattam Sanskrit theatre of Kerala. This sacred theatreform has been performed in temple sites for centuries, and has been preserved by members of only 5 Chakyar families who have passed down the practice of Kuttiyattam from one generation to the next. What has been preserved is not only the theatrical skills of the artists and the wonderful poetic language but also ideas and notions of life that have come down to us. During a Kuttiyattam performance once, the Chakyar explained how Arjun entered a peaceful forest and took half an hour to explain the meaning of peaceful  where the fearless deer sat near the lion, where the moth did not fear the flame, where the small bird flew and sang with great abandonment, knowing that there was no predator. Into that landscape of freedom let us all awake, next year.

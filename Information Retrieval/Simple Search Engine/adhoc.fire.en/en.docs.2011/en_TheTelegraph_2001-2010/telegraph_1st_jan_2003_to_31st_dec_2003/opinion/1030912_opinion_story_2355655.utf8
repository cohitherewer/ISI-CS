 O TAGORE, THOU ART TRANSLATED  Poetry and community: lectures  and essays, 1991-2001 By William Radice, Chronicle ,  Rs 450 This is a rather unfortunate book  by one of Rabindranath Tagores translators into English.  Page 48 is followed by a rerun of pages 33 to 48, followed  by page 65 and the rest. The messed up pages do scant justice  to what Radice himself describes as my relentless hard  work over the last thirty years. His words set the tone  of pompous self-promotion kept up through every lecture  and column. Most of them are about translating Tagores  poetry, a calling taken up by Radice because of his strong  sense of the injustice that Tagore as a self-translator   had done to himself. Most of the lectures are used to  puff Radices own translations  and worse still, his own  grimly mediocre poems  quite relentlessly. He hopes that  his own Myths and Legends of India is a work  of imagination, gusto, sympathy, insight, humour, feeling  and joy. He illustrates his own post-post-modernist classicism  with a sprinkling of bad occasional poems, some of them  written for his colleagues at SOAS to be circulated in the  internal mail (the SOAS Verses). The introductory eulogy  to Radice describes how lovingly an old lady, who knew  Tagore closely, waded through the small crowd around him  and conveyed her good wishes. A telling image of the Tagorean  establishment in Calcutta. OF SCHOLARLY CONCEITS  At home in diaspora: South Asian  scholars and the West Edited by J. Assayag and V. Benei,  Permanent Black, Rs 495 When south Asian scholars win  acclaim in the Western academia, East and West meet contra  Rudyard Kipling. In this volume, a handful of such social  scientists reflect on their predicament and on their intellectual  concerns. The volume has eminent names but there is very  little sense of engagement. Anybody who is aware of the  respect and influence Partha Chatterjees name commands  in US campuses will find it difficult to accept his conclusion  that he has less than one vote in the global republic of  letters. Ramachandra Guha has an interesting essay on those  who stayed behind in India, and Sanjay Subrahmanyam makes  a nice point when he points out that the career of Ranajit  Guha in Sussex and Brighton moved from eclipse to high noon.  Most of the essays are marked by much narcissism and self-indulgence,  which is surprising since most of the contributors are well  into the middle age. VOICES FROM THE PAST Historical thinking in South Asia:  a handbook of sources from colonial times to the present  Edited by Michael Gottlob, Oxford, Rs 695 This is a useful handbook for  students and teachers of Indian history. It provides a selection  of sources which articulates the various ways in which the  Indian past has been imagined and constructed. The selections  include over 50 representative excerpts from the writings  of scholars, social reformers, writers, politicians, social  scientists and cultural critics. Each section is prefaced  by a short but perceptive statement by the editor which  discusses the importance of the issue and the selected excerpts.  Its range is exhaustive  from the writings of William Jones  to the rantings of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. This is a  good reference book which will stand the test of time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Sunday, December 14, 2003  Letters to Editor				 																Whos afraid of Uncle Sam?				 																																																				Sir  Where has all the foreign ministry efforts to keep India in the United States of Americas good books landed our country (India shut out of Iraq bounty, Dec 11)? A neither-here-nor-there policy was not likely to get India meaty contracts from Iraq, as experts have been saying for a long time. So why not echo the sentiment of the majority of Indians and condemn US actions? What has a country of one billion people have to fear from a thoroughly biased, self-serving and imperialistic country? At least, let Jaswant Singh convey the message that India is not going to take this slight lying down.				 																																																				Yours faithfully, Kapil Kumar, Lucknow
				 																Fair and foul				 																																																				Sir  Every Indian should be proud of the fact that for the first time in the history of the country, three states of northern India are headed by women. There have only been four women chief ministers in the country before this. It is surely a good sign and hopefully, Vasundhara Raje Scindia, Uma Bharati and Sheila Dikshit will bring in new legislations to improve the lot of women in their states, and by extension, in the country. Perhaps the one achievement we can boast of when comparing the progress of our country against that of a first-world country like the United States of America is that while no woman has till date become the president of the US, we have already had a woman prime minister in Indira Gandhi.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Deepak K. Vidhyarthi, Muzaffarnagar

				 																																																				Sir  Does anyone really think that two women as chief ministers will translate into a wonderful time for women in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan? Havent we learnt our lessons from Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu? If Mayavati is voted out in Uttar Pradesh and J. Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu, then women voters will probably be instrumental behind it. Can anyone in West Bengal enjoy the thought of having Mamata Banerjee as its chief minister? Power is a great leveller as far as gender is concerned. A woman in power will do as little for women as a man will. The sooner the women of India realize this, the better for them.				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																																																				Sir  We badly need some organization to take up the cause of men. Men are in desperate need to be protected from aggressive women. Although it is true that cases of molestation, rape and assault of women by men are all over the newspapers everyday, it is equally true that sometimes men too are at the receiving end. Take for instance the comment of the new chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Uma Bharati. How could she, a sanyasin at that, claim at a public meeting that Digvijay Singhs underwear is missing? If a male politician made a similar comment about a woman, wont womens rights organizations be out for his head? Sadly, no mens organization has taken up Digvijay Singhs case so far. 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,

				 																College blues				 																																																				Sir  The Left Front governments announcement that it is not averse to granting autonomy to select colleges is an eyewash (Autonomy to colleges, but for unions, Dec 9). The government has clear political objectives in opposing autonomy to colleges. Surely the unions of the teaching and non-teaching staff cannot prevent the government from taking a firm stand on the issue if it wants to. Explanations such as opposition from unions are merely manifestations of the missing political will. When states like Andhra Pradesh have granted autonomy to colleges and are reaping the fruits of their decision, what is preventing the Left Front from giving the colleges what they deserve?				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Koyel Basu, Calcutta

				 																																																				Sir  I am a student of Class XII, about to take my board examinations next year. The thought of going to college after my exams fills me with a strange fear of inhuman torture by my seniors. Why cant the government take steps to stop this for good in our colleges? Or are we waiting for the day when ragging will be the norm in schools? 				 																																																				Yours faithfully,																															
Ranadip Das, Calcutta

 - What the Sholapur and Ernakulam bypolls bode for the Congress  Mahesh Rangarajan The author is an independent political  analyst and researcher The message from the byelections  in the run-up to as many as five state assembly elections  is clear to all who heed it. It is a wake-up call for the  Congress, the premier opposition party. Raring to go at  the ruling National Democratic Alliance, it has been rebuffed  seriously enough by voters for it to sit up and take notice.  If the past is any guide, the investigations and enquiries  will not touch the nub of the problem. The Congress is ready  for a role as an alternate party of power. But it has many  miles to go before it convinces the voter of the meaning  behind the message. Nowhere was this as clear as in two  crucial byelections to the Lok Sabha in Maharashtras Sholapur  and in Keralas Ernakulam.  The former is by far the more  worrying. No Congress government is conceivable in New Delhi  without Maharashtra. Even to cross the 150 mark in the Lok  Sabha, it needs to perform credibly in the state. In 1999,  the state proved the Achilles heel: come the general elections,  it may slip from bad to worse. Last time, what worked in favour  of the Congress was the all-round failure of the successive  Shiv-Sena-led chief ministers. This saw a remarkable polarization  of the anti-Hindutva vote on the ground. Though Sharad  Pawar and Sonia Gandhi had different camps, between them  they polled over half the popular vote. The Congress and  the breakaway Nationalist Congress Party had perforce to  come together and share power. It was a good beginning,  but it has proved to be little more than that. Despite the  replacement of the former chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh,  by the states first ever Dalit chief minister, Sushil Kumar  Shinde, the slide has continued. In fact, it may even have  gathered force.  Sholapur is in many ways atypical  of the state. Just over one in every five voters is from  the loose caste cluster of the Marathas who have long been  the dominant players in state politics. But the signs are  evident for all that care. The landed communities are voting  with their feet for the Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party combine.  The inability of the Congress and the NCP to come together  in a clear and unambiguous pre-poll understanding is giving  the Shiv Sena and its ally just the chance they have been  waiting for.  More ominous than that is the  glee with which the rout of the Congress candidate by a  120,000 vote margin has been greeted by the NCP. The upshot  is that the latter would prefer to see the Sena and the  BJP put the Congress in its place. In 1999, Pawar and his  followers preferred to leave the Congress rather than cede  first place to a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family. It is  clear now that despite the protestations of the Congress  that it will share power in a future government in New Delhi,  a key potential ally is not rising to the bait. The implications  of this development go well beyond the confines of Maharashtra. As if this were not serious enough,  the near rebellion by K. Karunakaran has cost the party  the Ernakulam seat. Even prior to Sonia Gandhis advent,  the management of inner-party contradictions has always  been a major challenge for the Congress high command. Indira  Gandhi managed to worst her opponents who had strong regional  bases and formed the once all-powerful syndicate within  the party. No such cabal came into being under either Rajiv  Gandhi or P.V. Narasimha Rao. Neither let the grass grow  under his feet.  The party has had a long tradition  of simply falling in line with the central leadership. This  is what makes the open sabotage of the United Democratic  Front candidate, M. John, a sign of the times. His proximity  to the chief minister, A.K. Antony, a confidant of the Congress  president herself, could not guarantee victory at the hustings. Kerala has never been an easy  state to manage, with its bewildering array of caste and  community vote-banks. But it is a rare state where the BJP  and its allies are non-existent and every vote that counts  is in one of two sharply polarized camps, one led by the  Marxists and another by the Congress. Antony himself was  out for a spell in the wilderness after the end of the Emergency,  when he tried in vain to break the mould of the two-front  system.  But this makes the 22,000-vote  margin by which the LDF candidate romped home more substantially  than in any other part of the country. After all, Kerala  is a state where one-fifth of the voters are Christians,  and this is unusual in that Sonia Gandhis own Roman Catholic  background is actually an asset and an advantage.  Byelections may not be accurate  indices of the popular mood at large. But it is normally  expected that bypolls will be a rough barometer of public  opinion. The fact is the Congress has not been able to capitalize  on the shortcomings of the Vajpayee-led government. In fact,  it remains trapped in its own intra-party dilemmas and in  the nitty-gritty of negotiating with potential pre-poll  allies.  There is hope yet  for in several  states, the party is relatively united, and has capable  and seasoned leaders who can take it into the electoral  battle. This is certainly the case in the four state assembly  elections to be held by the end of the year in the Hindi  belt. It is giving the BJP a run for its money. No one rules  out a command performance by the Congress chief ministers  who may yet defy the trend of anti-incumbency.  But it is certainly not the case  with the party at a pan-Indian level. There is a serious  mismatch between the rhetoric at the all India Congress  committee sessions and conclaves of the party leadership  and the reception its message gets from the voters. The  latter are unable to trust the Congress simply on its anti-Hindutva  agenda. Nor are they overly impressed by its new-found claims  at coalition-building. If anything, the party is in danger  of being reduced to an also-ran at the national level even  as it gets further entrenched as the natural party of power  in a host of states.  This will, in the long run, set  at work centripetal forces that will make it difficult for  the high command to lord it over the state units. This federalism  within one party cannot but run counter to the long lineage  of strong central leaders. The Sonia era, which has already  completed five years, has not reversed this trend which  has been at work in the post-Rajiv period.  If Sonia Gandhi is serious about  her partys long-term future, her work is already cut out.  She needs to give the party a sense of focus. It needs to  be less a carping critic of whatever Vajpayee does or Advani  says. It also needs to go beyond simply trusting in the  magic word of the Nehru-Gandhi family, which has been out  of power for almost one-and-a-half decades. In the absence  of such direction or clarity, the NDA stands to gain. It  will reap the gains of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who stands  above the fray within his party and in the nation at large.  It will also bind together anti-Congress forces like the  regional parties in closer accord.  The country needs a strong opposition,  if nothing else, in order to strengthen democracy. Another  rout in a general election will see challenges to Sonia  Gandhi from within. The cost of failure will prove high  not just for her party, but at one remove for the country  it had led for so long before its fall from grace.

		 Friday, November 07, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																The humour and pity of things Literary occasions: essays  (Picador, Rs 395) by V.S. Naipaul is a  slim volume of autobiographical and literary essays, edited  and introduced by Pankaj Mishra. It makes a nice companion  volume to The Writer and the World. Naipauls prose  is a perfect combination of lucidity, elegance and gloom.  There is a wonderfully funny chapter on Nirad C. Chaudhuri,  whose passage on the sob-chamber of Hindu family life,  in The Continent of Circe, is Naipauls favourite:  where the only competition is in gloom and people can legitimately  consider themselves provoked if they are told they are looking  well. There are nuanced, personal readings of Kipling and  Conrad, and the Nobel lecture, with beautiful passages from  Prousts early essays. But here is Naipaul: I have moved  by intuition alone. I have no system, literary or political.  I have no guiding political idea...Perhaps it is because  we have been so far from authority for many centuries. It  gives us a special point of view. I feel we are more inclined  to see the humour and pity of things. Unforgiving heights (Penguin,  Rs 350) by Betsey Barnes is one of those endless  succession of indifferent novels which keep popping out  of Penguin India. It is a novel set in a small Himalayan  kingdom, about a young American diplomat, her best friend  who is also the embassy doctor, another diplomats wife,  the Buddhist religious leader, the sister of the exiled  ruler and the incoming American ambassador. Intrigue in  high places. The writer is a Foreign Service veteran. 																												The thousand-petalled daisy (Maia,  7.99) by Norman Thomas attempts to combine offbeat humour and spirituality. Injured in a riot while travelling in India, 17-year-old Michael Flower is given shelter by a doctor in a white house on an island in a river. There, accompanied by his glove-puppet Mickey-Mack, he meets Om Prakash and his family, a tribe of holy monkeys, and Lila, the beautiful daughter of a diplomat. Unknown to him, the house is also the home of a holy woman. When she grants him an audience, Michael unwittingly incurs the jealousy of her devotee, Hari, and violence unfolds. The chapter headings sound like haikus and the author lives in Auroville, Pondicherry. The elephant and the maruti:  stories (Penguin, Rs 250) by Radhika Jha is  a collection of shortish tales more or less about the contradictions  of modern India. Apart from the eponymous animal and car,  there are communal conflict, Parisian restaurants and a  schoolgirls surreal encounter with the dark side of beauty.  Jhas first novel was Smell and it won the French  Prix Guerlain. Amarillo slim in a world full  of fat people: the memoirs of the greatest gambler who ever  lived (Yellow Jersey,  7.50) by Amarillo  Slim Preston with Greg Dinkin is about Thomas Austin  Preston, 64 and skinny as a rake. He has played poker  with two American presidents and with the drug lord, Pablo  Escobar, made a million dollars by the age of 19, and driven  a golf ball a mile. Preston won the World Series of Poker  in 1972, and is now a living legend and member of the four  Halls of Fame: If theres anything worth arguing about,  Ill bet on it or shut up. Links in the chain (Katha,  Rs 200) by Mahadevi Varma is Neera Kuckreja Sohonis  translation of this celebrated Hindi poets eleven essays  on the plight of Indian women. They were written in the  Thirties and examine the status of the Indian woman in relation  to her economic, civic, educational and legal circumstances.  Her aim is to capture the blurred outline of the Indian  womans frightful conditions.

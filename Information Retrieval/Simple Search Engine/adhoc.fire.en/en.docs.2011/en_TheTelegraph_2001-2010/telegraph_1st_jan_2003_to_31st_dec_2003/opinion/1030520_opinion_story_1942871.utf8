		 Tuesday, May 20, 2003  A NEW LOGO FOR HATRED
 - The hugely amusing act Togadia has put together with the  trishul  Bhaskar Ghose The author is former secretary, ministry  of information and broadcasting You just cant keep the doctor  away from the media. If it isnt communal filth that hes  spewing in various meetings, its this hugely amusing act  hes now put together with the trishul. It paid rich  dividends; the ever gullible Ashok Gehlot fell for it and  had him locked up, which gave Praveen Togadia all the media  attention he wanted. Whether he actually wanted to be locked  up or not is a moot point. He may well have wanted it, having  sensed the media benefits.  Many years ago, when the Bharatiya  Janata Party was still the Jan Sangh, one of its more erratic  candidates who contested the Chandni Chowk seat in the Sixties  was beside himself with joy and ecstasy when he won, and  demanded that he be arrested immediately. I was secretary  to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi then, and when the police  sent in this message, I was on the point of telling them  that the man could go and jump into the Jamuna for all that  we cared, but I thought Id tell the Lt. Governor first,  if only to amuse him; to my surprise the Lt. Governor, A.N.  Jha, wise man that he was, told me to ensure that the man  was indeed arrested. He wants his supporters to see him  as a fighter for freedom, you see, he explained gently,  so why not give him that image? It costs us nothing, because  the police can take him a little way down the road and let  him go, and you have a deliriously happy legislator in the  bargain. (And that, just to complete the story, is what  we did.)  But the chances are that Togadia  would not have been quite as frenzied because the experience  of being arrested and put in jail seemed  for a while,  at any rate  to have chastened him. Not for long, of course.  Hes back to his stand-up comedy act, waving trishuls all  over the place and doing all he can to fan hatred, violence  and evil in the crowds that listen to him. I suspect a large  amount of them think hes touched in the head; only a few  would be idiotic enough to accept the shrewdly-thought-up  abuse and violent rhetoric that Togadia has perfected. Make no mistake, to quote that  master of the English language, George W. Bush, hes doing  this basically to draw attention to himself. His primary  and only obsession is to get the media to keep talking about  him. If they stop doing so, he will probably drag himself  into a corner and die, a broken man. Media attention is  keeping this extraordinary creature alive. And the brilliance  of his seizing on the trishul as a device to further his  campaign of hatred and violence has left the bigwigs in  the Vishwa Hindu Parishad with virtually no alternative  except to acclaim it as a true campaign for the greater  Hindu glory they foresee coming.  In a recent television news programme,  Ashok Singhal worked himself into a lather trying to defend  the trishul campaign, and ended up saying what he himself  must have realized was so ridiculous as to be wildly funny.  Hindus are second class citizens, he thundered, and have  been so for the last fifty years. That is, as soon as we  became independent, Hindus became second class citizens.  Just as, presumably, Jews are second class citizens in Israel,  and Christians second class citizens in France, Germany,  Britain and in most of Europe.  In the same programme, Sheila  Dixit patiently tried to explain that the trishul was an  integral part of the accoutrements of Shiva, and had never  been used as a symbol by itself in a religious sense, in  the way Om or the swastika has been and is.  But the redoubtable Mr Singhal was going to have none of  that. Of course it has been used, he shouted into the mike,  the VHP has used it in its logo. You see where senile dementia  can take a person. The reference was to the use by Hindus  generally as a sacred symbol or emblem, which Om and the  swastika certainly are. But this gentleman equates that  with the VHP logo, which is more akin to the spear being  used in Shakespeares coat of arms. Nor did Singhal stop there. He  justified the use of the trishul as a symbol of unity, of  bringing castes together, of creating a Hindu identity,  among other things. What unity was he talking of? And what  bringing together of castes? When young lovers from different  castes are hanged by their own families, will the trishul  serve as a magic wand to bring the lovers to life? And will  it really make it possible for Dalits and Brahmins to live  side by side and eat together in the same place in the villages  of Rajasthan or Uttar Pradesh? When different political  parties are basing themselves on specific castes and communities  to gain access to power, is the trishul going to dissolve  these parties and bring about the triumph of the VHP? A rather curious dimension to  this issue is the inexplicable attitude taken by the minorities  commission. That body has said that the trishul campaign  is perfectly in order and is part of religious activity;  one member said, ludicrously enough, that if Sikhs could  wear the kirpan then what was wrong with carrying  a trishul? One had long suspected this particular commission  of being a creature of political powers, and this sort of  statement makes that suspicion very real. Sikhs carry the  kirpan because their holy scriptures specifically enjoin  all devout Sikhs to do so; what Hindu scripture enjoins  Hindus to carry a trishul? But then no one is really fooled  by Togadias mendacious rantings; neither, one suspects,  is Togadia. (Singhal may well be; he gives the appearance  of being incapable of anything else.) What he is using the  trishul for is pretty clear to most people; Togadia is using  the trishul as a weapon, an instrument of death and destruction;  he is desecrating what is and has for thousands of years  been sacred to real Hindus all over the world, the trishul  as a part of the image of Shiva, sacred to Hindus because  of being that, not because of the loathsome connotations  that creatures like Togadia are trying to give it.  Many years ago, because they considered  themselves the true Aryans, the Nazis appropriated one of  Hinduisms sacred images, the swastika. As long as they  were in power that image became synonymous with terror,  death, torture and all manner of evil. Fortunately they  got the form of the symbol wrong, and what they used was  not the true swastika as we know it. But their reason for  using it was no different from what Togadia is trying now,  except that Togadia knows exactly what the trishul looks  like. His campaign, carried out in the presence of the BJP  powerbrokers who hear no evil, see no evil and speak no  evil of this man, will be more insidious and dangerous since  it will be done among those who know and revere the trishul  as an attribute of Shiva himself.  The home minister is reported  to have said the campaign was wrong, or misconceived or  some such thing. If he really thinks that, what does he  intend to do about it? The answer is too obvious for me  even to set it down.

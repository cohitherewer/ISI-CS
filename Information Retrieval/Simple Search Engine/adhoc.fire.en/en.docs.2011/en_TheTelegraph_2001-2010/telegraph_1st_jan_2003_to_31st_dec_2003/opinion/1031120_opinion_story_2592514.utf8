		 Thursday, November 20, 2003  PRESUMED GUILTY
 - A criminal justice system modelled on the POTA is worrisome  Pratap Bhanu Mehta The author is professor of philosophy  and of law and governance, Jawaharlal Nehru University  Few people would dispute the claim  that the criminal justice system in India is in serious  crisis. Outdated policing methods, an inefficient judicial  system, poorly conceived laws, political interference and  sheer callousness have all conspired to produce a system  that often seems unable to either convict the guilty or  protect the innocent.  The Malimath committee on reform  of the criminal justice system was given a broad mandate  to suggest much needed reforms to the system. While the  report contains some useful suggestions, the overall thrust  of the report is dangerous for the health of the criminal  justice system. Rather than engaging in a serious critical  diagnosis of what ails the system, the reports central  premise seems to be that arming the state with more discretionary  and punitive measures, weakening the constitutionally guaranteed  rights of the accused, relaxing the presumption of innocent  until proven guilty, is the surest way of creating a better  criminal justice system. It is in the end, more a reflection  of the frustration with the ills of the current system than  a sober diagnosis of what can reform it. But it is in line  with the clamour for punitive measures that is becoming  acceptable increasingly in wide sections of India society. Nothing reveals the assumptions  that have guided the report better than a sentence on page  21. The report states that more specifically, the aim is  to reduce the level of criminality in society by ensuring  the maximum detection of reported crimes, conviction of  the accused persons without delay, awarding appropriate  punishments to the convicted to meet the ends of justice  and prevent recidivism. The report assumes, first, that  crime rates are simply a function of the ability of the  state to detect them. There is no evidence for this proposition  whatsoever. As we know from comparative evidence, countries  with more punitive legal systems and efficient detection  mechanisms as the United States of America have also had  high crime rates compared to their European counterparts.  This is not to suggest that detection of crimes is not important,  only to suggest that it is a piece of sociological fantasy  to suppose that crime rates are a direct function of the  powers of the criminal justice system.  But the phrase, conviction of  the accused persons without delay, indicates the tenor  of much of what follows. In reading a phrase such as this,  one is tempted to say what Seervai once said about a distinguished  judge, His Lordship neither understands English nor Law.  Surely this phrase cannot be meant literally. After all  a just criminal system ought ideally to convict the guilty,  not simply the accused.  But then, the report wants us  to move away from the thought that determination of guilt  ought to be the central aim of the criminal justice system.  Despite a hortatory appeal to discovering the truth, the  entire burden of the report is to weaken the presumption  of innocence that ought to be the bedrock of any sane criminal  justice system. Here are some of the presumptions  that the report tries to reverse. The committee argues,  without adducing any evidence that the adversarial system  of justice is centrally to be blamed for the pathologies  of our criminal justice system. Under an adversarial system,  the prosecution and the defence present respective versions  of the facts before the judge, who then weighs the merit  of each version depending upon the evidence. The committee  laments the fact that this system has no lofty ideals to  inspire it. It seeks to argue that the quest for truth  be made the corner-stone of the justice system, in which  judges are more proactive in investigations.  This shift in emphasis betrays  a woeful lack of understanding of the adversarial system.  Was not the premise of the adversarial system that the truth  would come out because it gave an incentive to all parties  to argue their case most vigorously? And for a committee  that claims that judges already have too much to do, giving  them an investigative role is surely asking for too much.  More important, the rhetorical  appeal to discovering the truth is patently disingenuous  coming from a report that seeks to lower the burden of proof  on what counts as truth. The committee recommends that the  standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt be replaced  by a fact is said to be proved when, after considering  the matters before it, the court is convinced that it is  true. Either this is a distinction without a difference  or the lowering of standard seriously jeopardizes justice.  The report openly expresses its skepticism about the proposition  that it is better to let a few guilty go free than to convict  one innocent person. It argues that this presumption should  be subject to a balancing calculus and that the scales have  been tilted too far in the direction of protecting the innocent. The committee forgets that the  idea of protecting the innocent cannot be subject to a utilitarian  calculus. What distinguishes a civilized government is the  fact that it does not make any individual merely an instrument  to its own purposes. For the state to risk convicting the  innocent would amount to the state committing a crime, and  that is a not a principle any civilized state ought to adopt.  In lowering the standard of proof, the committee risks jeopardizing  the foundational principle of any decent state. The law  commission itself had, in an earlier report, stated that  a dilution of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard would  be contrary to basic rights concerning liberty. The punitive thrust of the committee  continues. It recommends seriously weakening the right to  silence, makes it easier to use confessions as evidence  in court, increases the duration of police custody for the  accused, openly advocates the invasion of privacy rights,  increases the scope for summary trials, does away with the  provision that previous bad character ought not to be relevant  to determining guilt on a particular occasion, and recommends,  in a bizarre move, that the prosecution should be headed  by police officers of the rank of director general of police.  Again, the committee presents  no evidence or reasoning for why any of these measures will  lead to more effective prosecution of the guilty. On the  contrary, it ignores substantial evidence that our policing  system itself is one of the significant sources of injustice.  Imagine increasing the incentives for the police to extract  confessions, or leaving the accused to greater time in judicial  custody. As Ujjwal Singh, our foremost  authority on political prisoners in India, has recently  argued, the Malimath committee seems determined to use the  paranoia created by terrorism to import highly punitive  and liberty-restricting measures into ordinary law. For  example, in its discussion of the need to intercept communication,  the committee recommends that the Prevention of Terrorism  Act be followed: a suitable provision should be made on  the lines of section 36 to 48 of POTA, 2003 for the interception  of wired, electric or oral communication. To model the  criminal justice system on the lines of the POTA ought to  be a worrisome trend. Indeed on page 292, the committee  virtually equates organized crime and terrorism; in the  introduction, it openly advocates language used in the context  of fighting terrorism, making appeals that India should  not be a soft state. All of this would perhaps matter  less if there were any evidence that these measures would  work. The committee provides none and ignores all the evidence  that suggest that these measures will do more harm than  good. Its diagnosis of what ails the system is, therefore,  predictably narrow and unlikely to succeed. But then, perhaps  the agenda of the committee is not to reform the system,  but to make space for a kind of punitive ideology, that  makes us all feel we are being tough. Perhaps that is why  the committee cares little about the thousands languishing  in police custody without trials.

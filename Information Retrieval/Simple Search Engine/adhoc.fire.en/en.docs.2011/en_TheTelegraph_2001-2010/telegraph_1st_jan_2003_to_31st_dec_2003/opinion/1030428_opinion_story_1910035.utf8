		 Monday, April 28, 2003 				 UNDER THE SUGAR COATING
 GWYNNE DYER																								The tobacco industry waged a two-decade fighting retreat against the medical evidence that linked smoking to cancer, heart disease, emphysema and other illnesses. Millions died prematurely who might well have quit if the tobacco lobbys PR people and tame scientists had not laboured day and night to fudge the issue and confuse the customers. Big Tobacco may now be facing its Waterloo in the United States of America, as the courts award bigger and bigger settlements to its victims or their survivors, but the long rearguard action did keep the profits rolling in for 20 extra years. And now its Big Sugars turn.																								Last Wednesday in Rome, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization jointly launched an independent expert report on diet which stated that free (that is, added) sugar should not exceed 10 per cent of the calories in normal daily food intake. The US-based Sugar Association has gone into overdrive to discredit the report, demanding that the US health secretary, Tommy Thompson, use his influence to get the WHO-FAO report withdrawn. And sugar caucus Congressmen are threatening to cut off the annual contribution of $ 406 million that the US pays to the WHO if it doesnt back down. 																								Fat facts																								You have to admire the cheek of industry representatives who can maintain with a straight face that its perfectly all right for 25 per cent of the average persons calories to come in the form of free sugar, even as they have watched an alarming proportion of the US population turn into blubbery, lumbering Michelin-tyre men and women over the last generation. But then, if the pay was right, theyd probably be willing to argue that 25 per cent ground glass in the diet was all right.																								Most people intuitively understand that there is a link between obesity and some chronic and ultimately fatal ailments like diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The science is there to back these observations up, but people hardly need it. Less visible is the link between excessive sugar consumption and obesity, because most of the sugar is consumed invisibly in the form of fast foods and soft drinks. And the sugar industry will do whatever it can to stop that link being made public and official.																								Professor Philip James, the British expert who headed the international obesity task force that wrote the first WHO report on diet and nutrition in 1990, discovered that the sugar industry had hired one of Washingtons top lobbying companies when it realized the expert committee was going to recommend a 10 per cent limit. But the WHO didnt back down then, and it hasnt backed down this time either.																								Anything for profit																								The WHO assembled 30 international experts to draw up its report, including the leading US scientist on obesity, and it is in no sense an attack on sugar by the health nazis. It is about the health benefits of a diet that is relatively low in saturated fats, sugars and salt, and high in vegetables and fruits  hardly revolutionary stuff. Its recommended 10 per cent limit on sugar intake duplicates guidelines that have already appeared in 23 different national reports. But if people followed those guidelines, a huge chunk of the sugar industrys market would disappear, so of course it fights it. 																								It fights using the strategy that was pioneered long ago by the tobacco industry, and later copied by the industrial interests that wanted to deny the phenomenon of global warming. Set up one or more institutes with misleading names to throw doubt on the evidence  the International Life Sciences Institute, founded by Coca-Cola, Pepsico, General Foods, Procter and Gamble, and Kraft, is now accredited to both the WHO and the FAO  and use the Washington lobby system. Big Sugar will probably lose the argument in the long run, but 20 extra years of profits are worth fighting for. Deceive and delay, as George W. Bush said in another context.																								The only odd thing is this. It is not the poor countries where people live from the sugar that are leading the fight. It is the sugar industry in the rich countries, where people are dying of it.

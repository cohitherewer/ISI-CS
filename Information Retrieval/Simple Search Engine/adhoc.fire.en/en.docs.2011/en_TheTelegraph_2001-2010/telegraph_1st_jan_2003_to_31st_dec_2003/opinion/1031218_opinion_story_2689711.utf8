		 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 SUPREME IN LAW
																								The perspective of pure legality may not always square with concepts in other spheres. In upholding the Prevention of Terrorism Act on the grounds of legal and constitutional validity, the Supreme Court has made clear that the discomfort regarding the act has to do with issues other than legality. This is important for two reasons. For one, the way the Indian democratic structure is designed, there are three distinct areas of functioning accorded to the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. If each of these three arms stuck to their jobs, the practice of democracy would be a much smoother affair. But such discipline is rare. This is not only because encroachment on one anothers terrain becomes part of continuous behind-the-scenes political activity, but also because it is not possible to remain within unarticulated boundaries during the actual business of administration. At best, there can be a conscious effort to remain as close to the ideal division of labour as possible. The court has done exactly that. In so doing, it has also underlined the fact that the controversies raging around the stringent provisions of the new law are to do with problems of implementation and use, not legality. Hence, the worries about the law being used against minorities or against political rivals are really worries about the uses of power: the actions of the executive, in other words. The turmoil over Mr Vaikos incarceration by the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government in Tamil Nadu is a case in point. These worries are contained within the larger anxiety about the violation of human rights. It is this that the court has sought to counter by stating the act to be constitutionally valid. 																								The Supreme Courts decision is important for another  and allied  reason. For some time, the judiciary has been accused of over-activism. Yet its foray into territories that should be the administrations, such as pollution control and food distribution, has resulted from an abdication of responsibility by the executive. While in matters such as pollution control the Supreme Courts firmness has been greatly beneficial to civic life, that is not to say that it will be healthy for the democratic structure as a whole should these forays become routine. But pronouncing on the POTA, the court has also shown the way for useful porosity of territorial boundaries. It has suggested that public support for the ideology of a banned organization need not necessarily mean encouragement of its terrorist activities. In other words, the Supreme Court has asked for a nuanced and sensible implementation of the law. Perhaps Mr Vaiko has reason for hope.

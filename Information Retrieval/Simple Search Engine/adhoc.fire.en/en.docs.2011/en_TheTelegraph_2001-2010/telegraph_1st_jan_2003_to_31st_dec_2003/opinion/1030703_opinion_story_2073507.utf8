 - The poor have to be fed through well-designed, targeted  policies  BHASKAR DUTTA The author teaches at the University  of Warwick, United Kingdom There are reports that this years  rains may also be deficient. Since the total rainfall last  year was also below normal, these reports have raised the  spectre of droughts and starvation deaths in some parts  of India. Not surprisingly, a recent panel discussion on  NDTV focused on the issue of how people could be allowed  to die of starvation at a time when government granaries  seem to be too small to hold the stock of available foodgrains  in the country. The panel included a member of  the planning commission, representing the governments views.  He had a hard time defending the governments record in  food distribution. How can any government which professes  to care for the poor allow starvation deaths when there  are adequate stocks of food available with the government?  was the constant refrain. As is usual in such discussions,  emotions sometimes got the better of common sense, and some  irrelevant objections to current government policies were  also voiced. For instance, one panelist wanted the government  to ban all exports of foodgrains if the poor could not be  provided with adequate food. This is of course looking at  the problem from the wrong end of the telescope  the domestic  availability of foodgrains is sufficiently large to permit  everyone a square meal even after the export of food grains.  The problem is not one of availability, but of how to ensure  that the stocks reach the really needy. Why can the poor not get enough  to eat when there is no apparent shortage of food? Amartya  Sen would refer to his theory of entitlements and point  out that the poor have very low entitlements. Put in every  day language, the poor are simply unable to pay for the  food that they so desperately want or need. They are priced  out of the market since they do not have the incomes or  purchasing power with which to back their demand for food.The  only long-term solution is to raise incomes of the poor  so that they do not have to depend on government doles.  Indeed, it is a sad commentary  on the performance of successive governments in the last  five years that we have still not been able to raise minimum  incomes to levels which are at least sufficient to fend  off malnutrition. Although poverty levels have come down  over time, the rate at which minimum incomes have been increasing  is dismally poor. Clearly, the poor have to be fed now,  and this requires well-designed, targeted policies that  deliver food to the poor. There has been a fair amount of  discussion about ways in which the excess foodstocks can  be delivered to the poor. An obvious distribution channel  is the much-maligned public distribution system. The PDS  has been restructured in recent times. Two levels of prices  have been introduced. Households above the poverty line  are now required to pay substantially higher prices which  essentially cover the economic cost of delivering food grains.  In other words, the subsidy on food supplies to the APL  households has been more or less abolished. In principle, the PDS has become  friendlier to the poor. Issue prices have been reduced and  quotas increased substantially to those households which  are below the poverty line. Unfortunately, this does not  seem to have had the desired effect because there has not  been any dramatic rise in PDS purchases amongst BPL households.  There are several reasons for this. First, the relatively  poor are not able to take full advantage of the increase  in their rationed quota because they are constrained by  their low levels of income  many of them may simply not  have enough incomes to purchase the additional quantities  of foodgrains even at reduced prices. Second, the coverage  of the PDS leaves much to be desired  there may not be  any PDS outlets particularly in rural areas. Third, there are allegations that  some states have deliberately not supplied PDS outlets with  sufficient grains. The more charitable version of these  allegations contend that states do not acquire allotted  quotas from the Centre, while the more uncharitable stories  doing the rounds allege that the more villainous states  actually divert grains meant for BPL households to the open  market. Of course, all states should not be tarred with  the same brush  Kerala and Tamil Nadu have managed to ensure  adequate delivery of PDS grain to BPL households. People who are moved by the acute  social injustice sometimes wonder why the government cannot  arrange for the free distribution of food to the poor. Is  this not a better solution that letting the rats feast on  the grain in FCI godowns? they ask. Even if the government  were to release some quantity of foodstocks for this purpose,  it still has to work out a distribution network. Clearly,  the PDS is not a feasible option. Perhaps, a more effective  solution is to supplement the PDS by releasing a fixed quantity  of foodstocks to local bodies such as panchayats.  As in all such schemes, there would be a certain amount  of corruption in the form of leakages. But, the final outcome  would be better than the status quo. Another possibility is to channel  a much larger volume of foodgrains in rural works programmes.  Such programmes employ workers in the creation of rural  infrastructure, using the excess foodstocks to partly pay  workers in kind. Rural works schemes of this kind have often  been touted as ideal anti-poverty programmes because they  incorporate a degree of targeting. This is because only  the poor and needy will agree to work in such programmes  in view of the inadequate remuneration. Unfortunately, this solution also  has some fundamental problems. If the main purpose of such  schemes is to provide additional employment or simply to  use up the excess foodstocks, then the projects that can  be carried out must be highly labour-intensive. This places  a constraint on the kind of infrastructure or assets which  can be created. Typically, these cannot be particularly  durable assets  roads which are washed away during the  first monsoon being a good example. This obviously implies  a waste of the non-labour inputs used up in the programmes.  One might as well ask labourers to dig up holes and then  fill them up! On the other hand, if rural works programmes  try to create durable assets, then the projects cannot be  very labour-intensive. Then the overall scarcity of non-food  resources with the government implies that only a small  fraction of foodstocks can be delivered to the poor through  such programmes.

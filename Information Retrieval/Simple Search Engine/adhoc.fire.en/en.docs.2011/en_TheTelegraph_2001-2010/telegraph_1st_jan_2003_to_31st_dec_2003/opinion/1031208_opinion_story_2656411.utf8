 - How individuals, companies and countries rise from the ashes  Commentarao / S.L. Rao The author is former director general,  National Council for Applied Economic Research, and chairman,  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission raoslhotmail.com  Singapore: object  lesson  Individuals, institutions and  countries sometimes encounter great adversity, crisis and  even tragedy. Individuals might then sink into depression,  breakdown, mental illness, suicide or vengeful retaliations  against all and sundry. Others appear to overcome and commence  afresh, but suffer from occasional mental and even physical  disabilities. A few discover latent and hidden talents in  themselves that they mobilize for renewing and even reinventing  themselves. Institutions that fall into adversity could  go bankrupt or merge with another or get taken over or sell  their assets and downsize. Some find ways to transform themselves  to new success. Countries in such situations might deflect  the attention of their people by curbing freedoms, closing  their borders to movement and ideas, by going to war. Some  emerge stronger than before. A multi-media dance-theatre production  was staged in the last few weeks in major Indian cities  in November 2003. It epitomized one womans personal experiences  in dealing with great tragedy. It was by the Canadian Bharatanatyam  dancer of Indian origin, Lata Pada. The programme was unique.  It seamlessly wove together multiple sounds and music from  many parts of India, Canada and elsewhere, with visual footage  on the screen from as many sources and live dance by a troupe  of dancers led by Lata Pada. Technology has never been used  in this way before in India and enabled her to tell a complicated  and tragic story within eighty minutes. In coming years,  it is bound to lead to other attempts in India to marry  technology and live performances.  Even more extraordinary was the  complex and personal story it conveyed. It was of a happy  childhood in India, marriage, motherhood and domesticity  in Canada, the loss of husband and two teen-aged daughters  in the explosion, off the Irish coast, of Air Indias Kanishka  in 1985 on its way from Montreal to Bombay, the agony, anguish  and loneliness that followed and the social abhorrence of  widowhood in India. It shows her reinventing herself to  become within a few years a major figure in the arts in  Canada, with many students, performances and honours. It  took courage to present the story. It took enormous fortitude  and determination to overcome and emerge calm, compassionate  and dignified after this ordeal by fire. Tremendous artistic  talent combined with technology to do this within a short  performance. It is not surprising that it received critical  acclaim in north America and in India. The tragedy led her to a transformation  and a new beginning. The prime factor was her intense focus  on Bharatanatyam, which she had studied and performed since  childhood. After the tragedy, she immersed herself in it.  She went on to start a school for teaching and performing  dance. Her ability to introspect and question her life-experiences  helped her to push the envelope, explore uncharted territory  in her art, take risks and define her life and work on her  own terms. Her message is that everyone has it in himself  or herself to face disaster and tragedy and rebuild his  or her life.  Germany and Japan are two examples  of countries destroyed by war that reinvented themselves.  They built on the skills that already existed in their countries.  Japan decided to model itself on the United States of America,  used foreign aid, its low wages, artificially low currency  values and hard-working nature of its people to become low-cost  manufacturers. Japan also used drastic measures to bring  down the then high population growth-rate.  When Czechoslovakia split into  the Czech and Slovak republics some years back, no one gave  Slovakia a chance. The Czechs had the education, talent  and resources. Slovakia appeared to have nothing. But today  Slovakia is a vibrant and growing economy. The same can  be said of the land-locked African republic of Namibia.  The saga of Singapore after its conquest by the invading  Japanese and then the departure of the British rulers, owes  everything to the vision and determination of one man.  Each of these countries owes its  rejuvenation to leaders who harnessed the small strength  of its geography, people or resources. They transformed  their countries after crisis and decline. Such leaders do  not have to be charismatic, but they must have the creativity  to redefine their countries, and possess intelligence, determination  and the support of their people.  Companies periodically fall from  pedestals. Only a few rise again. TVS Motors under Venu  Srinivasan is an outstanding example of such a phoenix that  rose twice. He and his people proved the financial analysts  wrong by reinventing their company each time. They did it  by re-examining who they were, what they wanted to stand  for and worked out a meticulous plan for getting there.  When the moped market shrank, they had no other product  to offer. Their alliance with Suzuki and their ability to  absorb Suzukis products quickly and fight in the market  gave them a reprieve. The second time was when the market  was changing to motorcycles, and Suzuki tried to bargain  for control in return for their help. By then TVS had the  design and development skills to go it alone. It took great  courage, but they backed their own product although they  had no prior market experience with it. They put all their  resources behind it and succeeded. Arvind Mills under Sanjay Lalbhai  focused on one product  denim cloth  based on their own  development work. They had been a reasonably successful  textile-mill known for the quality of the large range of  their fabrics. It took courage to go after a worldwide market  using untested technology. But they did, and succeeded for  a while. Many copycats soon followed. Markets became very  competitive and margins fell. Meanwhile, the company put  a lot of its cash into the stock-market to take advantage  of the boom at that time. The market collapsed at the same  time as margins were falling on denim. The hubris from success  drove the company into imminent bankruptcy. Lalbhai was  written off. But he persevered. He learnt his lessons and  changed his business model without giving up his goal of  globalization, but went after domestic markets as well.  He offered a wider product range. Arvind is once again a  darling of the stock-markets. Ballarpur was a company that had  been written off for many years. No one imagined it could  revive. Vikram Thapar was given it to run and believed he  could do it. He did. ITC had its back to the wall in the  early Nineties when the media for months front-paged the  alleged wrongdoings (now proven wrong) of its top managers.  Today ITC, despite being primarily a cigarette-manufacturer,  is a major power in the stock-market. It is highly respected  and very successful. It is becoming less dependent on cigarettes  for its profits.  Leadership is vital to transform  and revive dying institutions and troubled countries. The  leader does not allow his people to wallow in despair when  things go wrong. He goes back to the drawing board to design  a different company or country from what it was, with different  and stronger skills and a new image. He takes risks into  uncharted territory, but his confidence is convincing. He  has the courage, determination and a clear plan of action  for doing it.  Renewal requires leaders with  clarity of goals, courage, integrity and the ability to  inspire followers. It requires imagination, determination  and guts to take on the job of changing the fundamentals.  Not everybody is tested by the kind of fire that Lata Pada  was. But there are smaller disasters, tragedies and crises.  People, institutions and countries have it in them to revive  after such events. They have to draw on innate skills and  strengths to do so. They have to be creative in redefining  their lives and of their organizations on their own terms,  not of some outsider. They must be compassionate, demanding,  and clever to build a supporting network, as necessary as  enormous stamina, and high personal integrity. That is creative  leadership.

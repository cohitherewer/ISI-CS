		 Friday, May 09, 2003  Paperback Pickings				 																White womans burden Wicked Women of the Raj (HarperCollins,  Rs 295) by Coralie Younger gives a romantic and  richly described account of European women who broke societys  rules and married Indian princes.Complete with photographs,  it captures the high-spirited, reckless ambience of the  raj, in which Indian princes scattered their wealth  and pursued beautiful white women to take home as their  wives. But the women themselves are as fascinating and determined  as the rajas. Not always from the highest levels  of European society, their consciousness of their power,  both as beauties and as members of the master race, makes  them the real heroines of these tales.  Mr Naipauls Round Trip and  other essays (Penguin, Rs 295) by T.G. Vaidyanathan  is a collection of writings by the striking personality  known as TGV to his peers in Bangalore. He taught literature  and film criticism, played first division cricket and wrote  about everything from psychoanalysis to umbrellas in a characteristically  provoking style. Although he writes with depth and compassion  about literature  the essay on Naipaul determines the title,  on cricket  his involvement with it forms the basis of  his friendship with Ramachandra Guha, who writes the foreword,   and on film, as on Shatranj Ke Khilari, he is at  his most entertaining and wittily profound when his subjects  are chosen from everyday moments, like secondhand bookshops  and stainless steel culture.  Ants, ghosts and whispering  trees: An anthology of oriya short stories (HarperCollins,  Rs 295) edited by Paul St-Pierre, Leelawati Mohapatra  and K.K. Mohapatra brings together twenty-two of the  most remarkable Oriya short stories written over the last  one hundred years. At the head of the collection stands  the father of modern Oriya prose, Fakir Mohan Senapati,  whose autobiography is a classic of Indian literature. The  short stories in the collection, which have been translated  by the editors themselves, focus largely on life in the  countryside. The portrayal of village life changes, as Orissa  changes  or persists  through the years. The book is important  because it not only opens up the world of Oriya literature  for the non-Oriya reader, but because it also provides further  evidence of the extraordinarily rich tradition of short  stories in Indian regional literature to the world.  Blood against the snows: the  tragic story of Nepals royal dynasty (Fourth Estate,  8.99) by Jonathan Gregson reads like a fast-paced  thriller. Yet it is the true story of the worlds only Hindu  kingdom. Gregson packs in much of the history of Nepals  bloodstained royal inheritance and its troubled politics  together with the drama of the last tragic and hideous episode  of murder in the palace. The authors gift lies in arranging  his amassed facts with clarity and logic, so that the analysis  naturally follows the lines of the narrative. Faith: filling the god-sized  hole (Penguin, Rs 250) by Renuka Narayanan  is the kind of mixed bag of milk-of-human-kindness reflections  that makes the perfect DIY faith book. It is important to  appreciate the authors use of contemporary issues, because  what does come through the inevitable woolly-headedness  of such entries as The coin of education and Husbandly  ethics is the insistence on pluralism. To achieve a confluence  of the faiths, she cites stories and sayings from a huge  range of religions. This gives to the book a slightly piquant  flavour, since the usual reflections on spirituality and  faith are thus given differing contexts and an appearance  of a practical code to live by.

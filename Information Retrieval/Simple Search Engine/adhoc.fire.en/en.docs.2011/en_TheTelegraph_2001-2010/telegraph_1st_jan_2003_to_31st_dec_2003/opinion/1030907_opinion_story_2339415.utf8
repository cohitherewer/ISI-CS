 - The mythology of origins, a narrative of loss  TELLING TALES / AMIT CHAUDHURI amitchaudhurihotmail.com Burra Kuttra, Dhaka  When I told people I was going  to Dhaka, they asked me if Id been there before. I could  neither say yes nor no. In effect, I hadnt. But my  wife and I had been offloaded there by Bangladesh Biman  in 1994. We were flying from London to Calcutta; in those  days, Biman was not a member of IATA, and over-booked as  a matter of principle.  We were deposited at the Mid-Town  Hotel, which we have always referred to, in retrospect,  as the dharamshala. The novelist Sunetra Gupta, a  close friend, was on the same flight, and now, like us,  off it. When we asked if she wanted to go out in the afternoon,  she demurred; shed rather sleep. I admired her, in private,  for taking this decision; to resist curiosity, to not lay  claim to the homeland even in the casual capacity of sightseer   this seemed to me the more morally courageous position.  My wife and I decided to be somewhat predictable; besides,  we were less tired. All three of us, it has to be said,  have our ancestral antecedents in this part of the world.  What I saw in those compressed hours of transit was so fuzzy  that nothing remained with me except a jumble of rickshaws  and intersections. The visit last month, then, properly  represents my first trip to Dhaka. My role, too, was clearer  than that of an offloaded passenger. I was to take part  in the launch of an international magazine of the arts;  and to sing, the next evening, at the Bengal Foundation.  Behind both the magazine and the foundation is a man, Abul  Khair, one of Bangladeshs new breed of industrialists,  who was providing me and my family with rather lavish hospitality.  Im not sure how Mr Khair made  his money; how the rich make their wealth, whether they  come from Bangladesh or India or America, is anyway always  something of a mystery. But he is unusual in two ways. The  first is that he is a Bengali; and, in being one, he  and  others like him I ran into in Dhaka  complicate a notion  that many of us have  that Bengalis cant be successful  entrepreneurs, at least not in the country of their birth. The second unusual thing about  him is that he is a sponsor of the arts; of art, specifically.  Of course, the rich are supposed to be patrons and collectors.  Its the context and history of Bangladesh, and of its modern  art, that make Mr Khair unusual. Hes been collecting paintings,  he told me, for about thirty years. Almost all of this collection  consists of the works of Bangladeshi artists, with a few  exceptions  among others, a large, strangely fascinating  Shuvaprasanna I saw in his house, a picture presumably of  a Calcutta terrace, empty except for crows and television  antennae; a well-known Gaganendranath cartoon, charged with  his characteristic, violent, expressionist humour. The rest   displayed on the walls of his properties: his company  office, the guest house we were put up at, even an employees  flat, not to speak of his own home  is the art of this  other Bengal, whose power and variety, before this visit,  I knew nothing about.  The night before we left Bangladesh,  Abul Khair took me to his house (its dimensions more like  a Beverly Hills mansion)  unwilling though I was (Id just  finished my recital, it was after eleven thirty, and our  flight left the next morning)  to offer me a cup of coffee  and the chance of looking at more paintings. I refused the  coffee, but couldnt resist the second part of the offer.  Id already become familiar, in the last three days, with  Zainul Abedins transfiguring and exquisite line drawings;  with the figures in Rokeya Sultanas paintings; with the  exaggerated bucolic panoramas of the man they call Sultan.  Three days was what it had taken me to realize that I had  to now rethink my understanding of the term, the art of  Bengal. As I entered the mansion, I thought  I heard loud laughter. I was right. Close to midnight, a  large entourage of family members, divided between a table  in the immense drawing room, and those eating dinner, were  talking to each other loudly: Mr Khairs son was to be married  in a week. Rural hospitality is how a friend has described  the largesse and warmth she has met with in Bangladesh;  and Im reminded of the phrase when I think of the scene  I came upon close to midnight.  Looking at the paintings arrayed  on the walls of several rooms, I was reminded of other things:  of Paninis eighteenth-century painting of Cardinal Valenti  Gonzagas picture gallery; of Tenierss seventeenth-century  portrait of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm with his private  collection, standing amongst subordinates, dwarfed in size  by the paintings he owns, but augmented in stature. But,  even at that midnight hour, I knew that Bangladesh was not  seventeenth-century Europe, nor Mr Khair the Archduke. Thirty  years ago, at the inception of this troubled nation, roughly  around the time that Mr Khair has discovered his passion  for owning paintings, Henry Kissinger called Bangladesh  an international basket case. What did this achievement,  then  both the collection, and the art itself  represent;  and in what ways did they illuminate each other? I dont know, though, if Mr Khair  would pose for a portrait. He is unprepossessing to the  extent that, although three or four times in the same room  as my mother (who was introduced to him more than once),  she believes she has not seen him. He is not only modest;  he has made himself, in some ways, invisible. The company guest house was in  an area called Gulshan II. This, and Gulshan and Banani,  neighbouring enclaves, comprise what one might call Dhakas  Greater Kailash. I dont make the comparison flippantly;  theres an air of New Delhi about these sections, and much  of what I saw of new Dhaka. A Pakistani friend says the  more affluent areas resemble their counterparts in Karachi;  I cant say, not having been to that city. You see a new  city in terms of what you know; and seeing becomes a subterranean  form of remembering. One thing became clear  Dhaka is not  a lost suburb of Calcutta, nor its backward twin. Dhaka  is a different conception of what it means to be a Bengali  metropolis. For one thing, much of the development  I saw took place in the Fifties and after. This is what  reminded me of New Delhi, I suppose; the mildly bureaucratic  air of the long interconnecting avenues, in which, in spite  of the burgeoning population, there is no street life: the  green, suburban enclosures of the rich.  The grand and derelict colonial  architecture that makes Calcutta surprising is missing;  but there are striking new buildings, among them the parliament  house and, overlooking a canal, the red-stone houses with  large hemispherical arches in which its members live. In  the course of my visit, I met two architects: Bashir-ul-Haq,  who lives in the lovely red-stone house he designed himself  years ago, and Luva Nahid Choudhury, the managing editor  of the international magazine of the arts. The question  that struck me upon meeting them, and which I asked them  naively, as if they might know the secret, had to do with  why there are so few distinguished architects in West Bengal. Having been to Dhaka and met these  people marks a significant break for me in my inner relationship  with that country. For the political entity we call Bangladesh  has been integral to the Indian Bengalis  whether or not  theyre originally from East Bengal  mythology of origins,  a narrative of loss. A whole literature and archive of the  liberal Bengali imagination have made it so. Its through  the prism of that mythology we experience  indeed, are  at all interested in  Bangladesh: as the site of a quest-journey  to our beginnings. Its as if, at the journeys end, we  will have solved a problem, found an answer. Occasionally,  the journey is made; often, it remains a powerful and poetic  idea. I, too, who have atavistic links to Sylhet, have always  wanted to, and always delayed, embarking on that quest. Travelling between Gulshan and  Dhanmandi and Baily Road and the University, however, I  feel I can leave aside that quest temporarily; it remains  to be made, and perhaps it will be. But going to Dhaka has,  in a sense, unshackled me from that search; and that brings  with it a sense of liberation from an old and all-encompassing  self-definition. Contemporary Dhaka confirms within me something  else; a current exploration. As if Id confronted a twin  whod grown up separately and become somebody else, it provides  me with a different notion of identity. The question, Who  am I? is only partly answered, after all, by returning  to our beginnings.

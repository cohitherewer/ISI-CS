The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 24, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Tapan Sinha, film-maker. You are warm, generous and affectionate. You prefer to appreciate the good qualities in people, rather than criticise their negative aspects. You are rooted to reality and seldom get carried away by emotion. Friends keep you in good spirits.   Kusum Bhandari

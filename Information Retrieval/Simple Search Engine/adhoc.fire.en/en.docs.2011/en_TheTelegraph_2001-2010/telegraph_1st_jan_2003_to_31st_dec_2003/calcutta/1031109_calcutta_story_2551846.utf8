The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, November 09, 2003 				 Strike boost to Trinamul
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The SUCI-led All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO) on Saturday joined forces with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress by calling a state-wide students strike on Monday against the illegal suspension  of six junior doctors of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.																								The Trinamul Chhatra Parishad will also march to Writers Buildings on the same day demanding resignation of health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra.																								However, the AIDSO strike will not affect examinations, a spokesperson said. 																								The Students Federation of India, the students wing of the ruling CPM, will oppose the strike.																								The Trinamul Chhatra Parishad, which has given a call for class boycott on Monday, urged students to march to Writers Buildings, to protest against the governments motivated decision to punish six junior doctors, including four interns.																								The health minister has no moral right to continue in office after the injustice on the junior doctors. As it is, the state of healthcare in Bengal is in a shambles, Baishwanar Chatterjee, president, Trinamul Chhatra Parishad said. 																								The Junior Doctors Federation (JDF), comprising members from the Medical Service Centre, Democratic Socialist Organisation, and some apolitical students bodies, will hold street-corner meetings across the city.																								JDF members on Saturday addressed a gathering on Nilratan Sircar Hospital premises condemning the government for singling out non-CPM affiliated students for punishment.																								We have decided to garner support for the hapless victims before lining up a bigger movement, said Dr Mridul Sarkar, spokesperson for Medical Service Centre, the anti-left healthcare group. Meetings will be held in front of all city hospitals and at important crossings like Bowbazar and Sealdah. We are desisting from ceasework as it might inconvenience patients, Sarkar added.																								Two conventions will be held next week. The first convention will be held on Wednesday at the RG Kar Hospital where JDF members will address junior doctors from all city hospitals followed by another convention organised by the Indian Medical Association headquarters at Medical College and Hospital on Friday.																								The four suspended interns  AIDSO members Subhajit Ray, Biplab Chandra, Subhankar Chatterjee and apolitical Rakesh Sharma  have decided to move Calcutta High Court on Monday against the governments move. They have also appealed to the principal of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital to reconsider the decision.

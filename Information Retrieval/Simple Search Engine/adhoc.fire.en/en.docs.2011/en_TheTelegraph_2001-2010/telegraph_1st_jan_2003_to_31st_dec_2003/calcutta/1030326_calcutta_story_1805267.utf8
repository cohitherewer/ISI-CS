The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, March 26, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Spread tracks far and wide
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should some existing trains starting from Howrah and Sealdah be shifted to the new rail terminals? More letters will be published next week Subhas Chakraborty  Subhas Chakraborty
 Minister-in-charge, department of transport and sports,  Government of West BengalSealdah station is equipped to  cope with 348 trains. But that is only theoretically. So,  it is best to build new terminals at Chitpore and Base Bridge.  Another terminal should come up to take some load off Howrah  as well. I had sent such a proposal to the Railway Board  about 10 years ago. It is good that RITES is acting on it.  The local trains can definitely be spread across the new  terminals. South Calcutta-bound passengers from the Ranaghat  line will find it easier to get off at Budge Budge while  those from Diamond Harbour wanting to go to north Calcutta  will prefer Chitpore as a terminal. Debyani Basu,
 Birati. 																																																														There is no question of denying that both Howrah and Sealdah are now under pressure. Much renovation has been done but to no avail as the pressure has reached saturation point. The problem becomes unbearable during office time. After new terminals are built, some existing trains starting from Howrah and Sealdah should be shifted there. 									

Virendra Shah,
																		Amratalla Lane.																																																														Considering the present situation at Howrah and Sealdah stations and the ever-increasing load on them, shifting of trains to new terminals is essential. But whether the state government and the local authorities will be able to undertake this task and implement it smoothly, without inconveniencing the public, is doubtful. As such, there is a lack of political will, with politicians more interested in multi-million-dollar projects than small schemes, which can be executed quickly and efficiently.									

Seraj Alam,
																		Bansberia.																																																														Yes, the proposal is desirable. But merely changing routes and terminals is not enough. The convenience of commuters should be the top priority. It is true that Howrah and Sealdah stations are congested. Hence, introducing some new trains at the proposed terminals will improve the situation.									

Fakhre Alam,
																		Tiljala Lane.																																																														I dont think this is a good idea. However, it can be started off on a trial basis, to see if it helps passengers. If some existing trains are shifted from Howrah and Sealdah to the new rail terminals, then the number of trains available at Howrah and Sealdah will be fewer and the frequency of trains will be less. Therefore, there would be more congestion at these two stations, since passengers would have to waste time waiting for trains. It would be better to start new trains from the proposed rail terminals, instead of shifting the existing ones.									

Amitava Mukherjee,
																		Barrackpore.																																																														No. I think shifting existing trains from Howrah and Sealdah to the new rail terminals would be a terrible idea from the point of view of commuters.									

Ananya Banerjee,
																		Unique Park.																																																														Conveyance and communication play a vital role in the lives of people in big cities. Both are in disarray in Howrah and Sealdah stations. In order to reduce the congestion, some existing trains can be shifted from there to new rail terminals. But only if these terminals have the proper infrastructure, like a good public transport network connecting them to different parts of the state. 									

Prasenjit Das,
																		Jadavpur.																																																														No. If the trains are shifted, many people will face inconvenience. The passengers, who come to Howrah or Sealdah stations by long distance trains, can get connecting trains or catch a cab to reach their destinations. If the rail terminals are shifted, then the passengers will miss these facilities. So, long distance terminals should not be shifted.									

Kanai Saha,
																		Gauri Bari Lane. Yes. Howrah and Sealdah stations  are too busy and crowded for the current list of local trains  and long distance mail and express trains. If some existing  important trains are shifted to the new terminals, passengers  can go directly to the new terminals. As a result, the crowd  will be reduced at Howrah and Sealdah. The sooner the new  terminals come up, the better for commuters. So, the proposal  is most welcome. Clogged: Sealdah station
 Sandipan Dutta,
																		Sukantapally.																																																														Both Howrah and Sealdah are too busy with regard to the number of trains. In order to minimise the crowd and provide more comfort to passengers, it is logical to open a few more terminals in Shalimar, Chitpore or at Diamond Harbour.									

Tapan Pal,
																		Batanagar.																																																														Yes. Those terminals are too crowded and chaotic. 									

Rajababoo,
																		Ramlal Dutt Road.																																																														No, because in our state, the population is increasing day by day. So, we need more trains to accommodate the number of commuters. Hence, additional trains must be started off from the new rail terminals and the existing ones from Howrah and Sealdah must not be shifted. If these existing trains are moved to the new rail terminals, it will greatly inconvenience people.									

Naren Sen,
																		Santragachhi.																																																														Why not? Calcuttas road network is limited. So, new stations must come up, keeping in mind this infrastuctural obstacle. Bidhannagar rail station can be turned into an additional terminal. It will help passengers if some mail or express trains are started from Santragachhi. The Kona Expressway lies close to Santragachhi station, and it will be easier for passengers to reach south Calcutta and Howrah. There is enough space on the northern side of the platform for a Calcutta-Howrah taxi, bus and minibus terminus. 									

Neera Fogla,
																		Upper Chitpur Road.																																																														Howrah and Sealdah station are congested all the time. So, if some existing trains are shifted from Howrah, like the Kalka Mail Deluxe and the Rajdhani, and some from Sealdah, like Jammu Tawi, it will be more convenient for people. Saadia Sitwat,
																		Linton Street.																																																														I think this is a good proposal, because the existing terminals are in bad shape, with chaos and mismanagement reigning supreme. People often have to spend nights at the station since trains are frequently delayed. We can only hope that the new terminals actually help commuters.

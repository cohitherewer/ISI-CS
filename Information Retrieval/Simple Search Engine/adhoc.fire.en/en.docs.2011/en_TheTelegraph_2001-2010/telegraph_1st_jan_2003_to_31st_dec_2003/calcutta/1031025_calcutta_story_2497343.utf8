 A STAFF REPORTER																								The government will carry out medical tests on the students of Prafulla Chandra College, who were assaulted by a group of local goons at Deuria Sadar station, in Uttar Pradesh, on board the Bagh Express, while returning from a trip to Nainital.																								Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said some students were reported to have suffered serious injuries, and so a thorough medical examination is a must.																								I have already asked the additional director-general of police (rail) S.C. Avasthi to probe the incident. And medical tests will be conducted on those who were injured in the attack. The medical report will be sent to the Uttar Pradesh government, so that it takes up the matter seriously. The West Bengal government expects the Uttar Pradesh police to take up the matter seriously and take appropriate action, Deb added.																								Of the 60 students on the Bagh Express, 20 were injured when some locals, who forcibly boarded the reserved compartment of the train, beat them up. The students had protested their forcible occupation of reserved seats and their misbehaviour with some women passengers.																								The railway police at Bhatni station, where we lodged the complaint, did not even give us a proper hearing, alleged Subha Samanta, one of the students who suffered injuries.																								They refused to believe that we were thrashed by the goons. When some of us showed them our injuries, they told us to stop the nonsense and get lost. The way they dealt with our case, we are sure that the complaint will remain on paper and never be taken up, he added.																								State administration officials said the attack had taken place under the railways jurisdiction and so railway police from both Bengal and Uttar Pradesh would pursue the matter.																								Senior railway police officers said they would record the statements of each of the students and the teacher of the college travelling on the train. As the college is closed for the Pujas, it will take a while to collect all the statements, individually.																								The medical tests, meanwhile, would be conducted at government hospitals and the findings, along with the students statements, sent to the UP railway police.																								The state government has taken serious note of the matter and wants the accused to be punished. Students travel around the country, the year round. It is the duty of the railway police to ensure their safety and security on trains, stressed home secretary Deb. Avasthi said he had initiated steps to collaborate with the UP Police.

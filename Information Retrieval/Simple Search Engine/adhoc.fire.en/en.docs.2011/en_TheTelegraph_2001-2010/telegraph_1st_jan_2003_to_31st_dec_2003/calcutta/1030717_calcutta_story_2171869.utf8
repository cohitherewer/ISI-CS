																																																																																		Three persons lost their lives on Wednesday after being knocked down by speeding vehicles. A 35-year-old unidentified man was hit by a bus on route 55A at the Portuguese Road-Brabourne Road crossing, in the Hare Street police station area, in the morning. Police said he was taken to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where he was pronounced brought dead. In another incident during the day, Rama Devi, 45, was mowed down by a bus on route 47/1 at the Chowringhee-Shakespeare Sarani crossing. Police said she was declared dead at SSKM Hospital. A truck crushed Pradip Chowdhury, 30, under its wheels in the morning on Jessore Road near Gouripur, in the Airport police station area. The driver fled with his vehicle.																																																		Metro Rail services in the Down line from Dum Dum were disrupted between 9.59 am and 10.10 am on Wednesday after a Tollygunge-bound train developed a technical snag and halted at Belgachhia station for 15 minutes. Metro sources said the crew detected a snag in the train just after it left Dum Dum. A Down train was cancelled and 10 others were rescheduled as a result, sources said. 																																																		Seven passengers of a private car were injured after a minibus rammed into it on Wednesday morning at the Queensway-Casuarina Avenue intersection, in the Maidan police station area. Police said the minibus lost control and dashed against the car, before hitting a CTC and a CSTC bus.																																																		A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in Calcutta High Court on Wednesday challenging a recent decision of the Bar Council of India, demanding the transfer of judges whose close relatives were practising in the same courts. The council had identified 11 such judges of Calcutta High Court and asked its state unit to take necessary steps after making a thorough inquiry into the matter. Petitioners Idris Ali and Debabrata Chatterjee contended that the council had no jurisdiction to demand the transfer of the judges. The decision violates the Advocates Act. The council should be restrained from giving effect to the decision, they claimed.																																																		Anusree Banik, a doctor at Sambhunath Pandit Hospital, was robbed of three gold bangles and Rs 600 on Wednesday evening in her quarters by three youths of the hospital canteen. Police said the three were armed. They are absconding.																																																		Some unidentified assailants shot at a youth at Lake Town on Wednesday morning. The youth was admitted to a local hospital. Two persons were arrested, police said.																																																		Classes are likely to be affected at Medical College and Hospital on Thursday with the Medical College Students Union set to stage a four-hour demonstration in front of the principals office, demanding a freeze on the proposed hike in tuition fees.

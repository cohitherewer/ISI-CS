	These days, every residential complex in the city has its  own Durga puja. This used to be a low-key event earlier,  but now the budgets have soared sky-high. In several complexes,  difference of opinion among the managing committee members  has resulted in two pujas being held on the same ground.  This puts the residents under tremendous pressure.

	The city police deserve plaudits for installing traffic  signals on Canal Road, off EM Bypass, near Apollo Gleneagles.  The absence of any signals had made this stretch extremely  accident-prone. 
	 B.L. Chandak, Salkia.

 Friday, September 12, 2003  Lens look at the last hero
 Shyam Benegals biographer Sangeeta  Datta followed the filmmaker to Berlin where he canned  the interaction between Netaji and the Fuhrer for his biopic  Benegal with Sachin Khedekar (left) on the sets of Netaji   The Last Hero. Picture by Ashoke Majumdar  Berlin: Hitlers office,  May 27, 1942. A historical meeting takes place between  the German Fuhrer and the Congress rebel from India, Netaji  Subhas Chandra Bose. Bose has raised the Indian legion or  Azad Hind Fauj from the prisoners of war in Germany and  Italy. He planned to march this army into India through  Russia. However, when Russia is attacked by Hitler, Boses  plans fall through. He hears about the formation of the  INA in Singapore and the advance of the Japanese army across  Asia. For the past year, Bose has been trying to get to  Japan. It is only after his one and only meeting with Hitler  that Bose is given permission to leave. Hitler offers him  a U-boat, which will take him by the old sea route all the  way round the Cape of Good Hope to Madagascar. Here, Bose  transfers in mid-ocean to a waiting Japanese submarine. Berlin: Charlottenburg Town  Hall, July 31, 2003. This historical meeting is re-enacted  on celluloid for Shyam Benegals biopic entitled Netaji   The Last Hero. The German schedule of Benegals  film has recently concluded on location in Berlin and its  outskirts. Charlottenburg is the borough in which Bose had  his own original office. A large room in Town Hall has been  transformed into Hitlers headquarters, with the overbearing  Nazi insignia on the gleaming wooden panels. English-speaking  German actors have been cast in the roles of Adolf Hitler  and other Nazi officers  Van Tropp, Ribbentrop and Kepler.  Udo Schenk, playing Hitler, has already been offered the  Nazi dictators role in another big-budget Hollywood film.  Christain Spitzl, a popular TV actor, has carefully researched  the life of Van Tropp. Other actors have travelled long  distances, some from Munich, Vienna, Poland and Switzerland. Silence! floor manager Linda  Barutzki shouts. Action! says Benegal, as he lowers his  raised hand. Bose walks in and shakes hands with Hitler;  the frame is an uncanny echo of a familiar photograph in  our historical archives. Hitler is alternately indulgent  and hysterical. Bose is strong and unflinching. He asks  for help to travel to Japan, Hitler advises him to take  a U-boat. The four-minute-long take is a  challenge in the stifling heat, both to the German actors  speaking in a foreign tongue as well as the Indian cast  who feel the historical weight on them. Lines get muffled,  actors break into sweat, the director sits at the monitor,  relaxed, urging the cast to find their rhythm. With requests  from cameraman Rajan Kothari and sound engineer Ashvin Balsaver,  Benegal agrees to a few more takes. This is a decisive historical  moment, the shot has to be right. The 30-strong Indian cast and  crew are joined by an equal number from the German side.  A German company, International Production Services, is  in charge of local production logistics, providing the cast  and technical crew, displaying great spirit and humour.  The days schedule is preceded by detailed pre-production  meetings. The Germans want all possible questions answered,  Benegal and his executive producer Raj Pius are patience  personified. Chief assistant director Ravi Kemoo has storyboards  mapped out with precision. Scriptwriters Shama Zaidi and  Atul Tiwari pore over the dialogues every evening. Pick-up cars arrive at the Citadine  hotel for the Indian unit at 6 am. The day starts on location  with a lavish breakfast served by the best caterers in the  German film industry, Moviecat. Sachin Khedekar transforms  into Bose with his prosthetic chin and round glasses. The  actor has had to shave his hair daily to resemble the balding  Bose in his forties. Khedekar admits that in living Boses  identity for a year, my perception of life has changed,  I must admit that I have grown as a person and see life  differently today. Rajit Kapur, part of the Benegal  repertory and here playing the role of Abid Hasan, is on  the set early morning, joking and elevating moods. Priya  Benegal, the costume designer has been on the set earlier.  Her costume truck is impressively organised, the actors  costumes, labelled and hung neatly.  Much research has gone into the  cuts and designs of period costumes, the Nazi costumes sport  shining brass buttons. Rajan Kothari, the cinematographer,  as always is cool as a cucumber; a man of few words, he  knows what he wants and more importantly, how to get it.  Ashvin, the sound recordist, has been doing synch sound  for Benegals films for many years, much before this recent  hype over synch sound in Bollywood films like Lagaan  and Dil Chahta Hai. Benegal, in his characteristic  manner, greets everyone on the sets. As always, there is  great geniality in the man and his unit reflects the same  spirit. It has been a long haul. There have been schedules  in Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, Uzbekistan and now Germany.  After which, a long schedule was planned in Myanmar, where  the war scenes have to be shot. Netaji is perhaps  the most ambitious project in Indian film history in terms  of its historical and geographical canvas. So why is Netaji  called The Last Hero? Because he is truly the  last romantic hero of our nationalist history. In this film,  I have concentrated on his final course of action. When  he disappeared from house arrest in Calcutta and started  his four years saga of endurance, he had but one fixed  idea: to raise an army to fight for Indias independence.  The war that the INA undertook was a true war of independence. Look at the journey he undertook,  from India to Peshawar, through Russia, to Germany. Then  the long journey in the U-boat to Japan when he doesnt  see daylight for three months. Bose finally arrives in Burma  at the head of the army, advances to India through Manipur  and Assam. The Indian Tricolour is planted on Indian soil  for the first time. Joining us in the discussion are  the scriptwriters, Zaidi and Tiwari, who have spent 18 months  researching their subject. Also present is a young scholar  from Hiedelberg University, Jan Kuhlmann, whose book on  Bose is just out in Germany. The German chapter of the schedule  also includes the romantic angle to Netajis story, his  marriage to his secretary Emilie Schenkle. In a beautiful  small castle in the countryside of Brandenburg, a song sequence  is picturised Desh ke mitti ki khushboo yaad aati hai  (I remember the fragrance of the soil of my land).  As Subhas walks through the pastoral  landscape, young Emilie (played by the petite talent Anna  Prustel) snuggles up to him, the lovers embrace and walk  closely as they pass a scarecrow in the fields and a horse  carriage brushes past them. Sceptical questions are whispered  in the unit  what will Calcuttans say about this scene,  can Netaji sing a romantic/nostalgic song? How difficult  will it be to see Bose as human for those to whom he has  already transcended into myth? Benegals unit was to proceed  to Keil Harbour to shoot the scenes on the U- boat before  wrap up. The Rs 20-crore production for Sahara India will  spend a quarter of its budget in the present schedule. The writer is author of Shyam  Benegal, published in India by Roli Books

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two brothers armed with a double-barrel gun and an improvised revolver were caught when they entered a garment traders Beleghata apartment on Monday morning. The duo, said to be the traders ex-employees, was later handed over to the police and booked on attempt-to-robbery charges.																								The trader, Sandip Sethia, and his son, Sunil, were injured in a scuffle with the two.																								After interrogating Manoj Pandey and brother Babloo, both in their mid-twenties and hailing from Ajmergarh, in Uttar Pradesh, the police came to know that Sethia, who runs a shop in Burrabazar, had sacked them a year ago. 																								The brothers told us that they had gone to Sethias house to collect their dues, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police, detective department. According to Mitra, the incident took place around 10 am, when Manoj and Babloo reached Sethias house, in Asutosh Shastri Lane. As they pressed the calling bell, Sethia opened the door. The duo entered the drawing room brandishing the gun and the revolver, stated Mitra.																								We helped you to establish your business. But you have done an injustice to us. Let us complete the deal and you pay us all our dues, Manoj told Sethia.																								The trader pounced on the duo. His son, Sunil, also joined him, said Mitra. Together, they pinned down the two attackers. They then called in officials of Beleghata police station and handed over the duo.																								According to Mitra, Manoj and Babloo had waited a year to teach Sethia a lesson for sacking them. We are contacting our counterparts in Uttar Pradesh to get more information on the brothers, he added.																								nConstable in hospital: Gour Mondal, a constable of Domjur police station, in Howrah, who was reported missing, was found in Basirhat, North 24-Parganas, on Monday.

 Friday, February 14, 2003 				 Probe cloud over private traffic signal
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Public Works Department (PWD) minister Amar Chowdhury has ordered an inquiry into the construction of a traffic signal at the crossing of VIP Road and Bangur Avenue by some local residents. Metro reported the matter on February 8. 																								Chowdhury said on Thursday that officials from his department, North 24-Parganas police and South Dum Dum Municipality will carry out a joint inspection on the spot and submit their findings to him on Sunday. I will initiate action after I get the report,  Chowdhury said.																								A meeting was held on Thursday in his office, attended by district police officers, representatives from the municipality and PWD officials. It is learnt that the civic officials expressed their grievance over the signal. 																								It is astonishing that private parties, with assistance from a commissioner of the municipality, have erected the signal without the knowledge of the state government. We will not tolerate such things, because none of the organisers had sought permission from the state government before setting up the signal, Chowdhury asserted.

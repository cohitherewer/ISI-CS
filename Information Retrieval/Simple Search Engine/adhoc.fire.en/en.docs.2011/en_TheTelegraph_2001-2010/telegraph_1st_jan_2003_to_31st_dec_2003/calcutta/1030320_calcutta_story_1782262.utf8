The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, March 20, 2003 				 Brothers held for trader dupe
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Howrah police claimed to have busted a racket in inter-district cheating with the arrest of two brothers from a Golabari hideout on Wednesday morning.																								Brothers Dayal and Dilip Majumdar have cheated shopkeepers and traders of districts like Burdwan, Birbhum, Hooghly, North 24-Parganas and South 24-Parganas of goods worth several lakhs over the past eight months. Superintendent of police (Howrah) Rajesh Kumar said: We have evidence that they had cheated a Calcutta trader, too. My officers are getting in touch with Calcutta Police.																								Kumar said the brothers would approach shop-owners in the districts as customers for consumer goods like scooters, cars, motorcycles, television sets and computers on instalment. They would submit forged documents and flee with the goods, he added. Police raided Majumdars hideouts in Hooghly and Howrah and recovered new cars, refrigerators, television sets, computers and other valuables.																								Citing one case in Howrah, Kumar said the duo walked into a Hero Honda showroom in Golabari last week to look for a bargain on a new motorcycle in instalments. The brothers introduced themselves as traders from Durgapur and showed the shop-owner forged documents of their offices and house there, Kumar said.																								The owner was not convinced and accompanied the brothers to Durgapur. There, they showed him an empty house, claiming it was their ancestral property, a police officer said.																								The two brothers are suave talkers and the owner was taken in, the officer added. The house they passed off for their own belonged to a friend who had gone on a vacation with his family.																								The brothers Majumdar gave the shop-owner a set of post-dated cheques and forged documents and collected the motorcycle. The initial cheque bounced and a closer scrutiny of the documents revealed that they were forged, superintendent Kumar said.																								We sent a team to Durgapur and the members, picking up leads on the antecedents and whereabouts of the two brothers, raided their Golabari hideout on Tuesday night, he said.																								The stolen items were impounded and brought to Golabari police station. Dilip and Dayal were produced in court on Wednesday and remanded to a weeks police custody, Kumar added.

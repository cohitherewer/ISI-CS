																								Nearly two decades ago, a group of talented and enthusiastic artists, all ladies, decided to congregate under an umbrella organisation and pursue their creative urges independently in right earnest. The Group was formed. Since its inception, The Group has been striving hard to make its presence felt in the annals of art and now, after two decades of hard work, its members can sit back and relax on its laurels. What distinguishes the members of The Group is the diversity of their works that reflects their energy, vision and talent to create and continuously re-invent themselves. The veterans of The Group have shown quality resilience and their interaction and warmth with the younger artists give more strength to the movement. They organise seminars, workshops in between their creative schedules where they interact and exchange ideas, enriching their own vision in the process. The current exhibition is part of an on-going series to portray sensitive and humanistic themes through painting and sculpture. The works reflect the myriad moods of human beings and all the works are done in monochromes. Participants include Santosh Rohatgi, Shyamasree Basu, Anjali Sengupta, Sefali Mukherjee, Sudeshna Das, Ballari Mukherjee, Arati Das, Anita Dutta, Tapati Mukherjee, Madhusree Muchhala and sculptor Uma Roy Chowdhury.																								When: Till December 7; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

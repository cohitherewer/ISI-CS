 Thursday, October 02, 2003 				 Beheaded body in roadside shrub
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The beheaded body of Archideb Bhattacharya, alias Buban, 30, was found on Kalyani Expressway, in the Kharda police station area, on Wednesday. No arrests have yet been made.																								Policemen found the body in the bushes in two halves. Local residents identified it as Bhattacharyas. The body has been sent for post-mortem, said a police officer.																								Bhattacharya, a resident of Rashmoni More, used to give tuitions. He had several students and used to earn a substantial amount. We have also come to know that he used to lend money to individuals on interest. This may have contributed to his murder. We are interrogating some people to find out what type of customers he had, the officer added.																								His head was severed from his body. The assailants also tried to chop his limbs. After initial investigation, we suspect he was not murdered at the spot, said K. Jayaraman, additional superintendent of police, Barrackpore. Judging by his wounds, this does not seem to be the work of a professional, the senior official added.																								Although Bhattacharya did not return home on Tuesday night, family members did not lodge a complaint as it was not unusual.

 Tuesday, January 07, 2003 				 Romeo Juliet
																								The eternal love saga of Romeo and Juliet has stirred millions of hearts for centuries and has inspired poets, musicians and all creative artistes to recount the passion and pathos inherent in the story. Strangely though, this tale was never attempted in Indian classical dance forms. Kalashram, under the aegis of the legendary Kathak maestro, Pandit Birju Maharaj, presents this mega production in Kathak style. A group of 60 to 70 artistes, mostly from the city, including dancer-choreographer Saswati Sen, Deepak Maharaj, Ashim Bandhu, Luna Pan and Molly Roy will participate. The music for the ballet has been composed jointly by Pt Birju Maharaj and Louis Bank. The entire choreography is based on instrumental music and no lyrics have been used. The choreography adheres strictly to the classical Kathak tradition, and enhances the beauty of the dance form with its contemporary approach.

 Monday, August 11, 2003 				 Highrise boom takes its toll on water supply 
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The South Dum Dum Municipality, hamstrung by lack of infrastructure, has decided not to provide any new piped-water lines to multi-storeyed buildings mushrooming in the area. The CPM-led municipality took the decision at a board meeting last month, despite protests from Trinamul Congress councillors.																								We supply drinking water to nearly four lakh people in about 55,000 houses. But with the spate in construction of highrises, the municipality is finding it difficult to supply water to the apartments, said municipality chairman Srihir Bhattacharya. 																								The municipality provides 21 million gallons of water to residents. The water comes from 58 deep tubewells, six overhead reservoirs and 62 shallow tubewells. But the supply is falling short of the growing demand. We have asked the developers to arrange the supply. We will issue completion certificates to highrises after inspecting the water supply system in the apartments, said council member in charge of water supply Anup Mitra.																								The municipality will, however, instal a single drinking water connection to a complex, Bhattacharya added.

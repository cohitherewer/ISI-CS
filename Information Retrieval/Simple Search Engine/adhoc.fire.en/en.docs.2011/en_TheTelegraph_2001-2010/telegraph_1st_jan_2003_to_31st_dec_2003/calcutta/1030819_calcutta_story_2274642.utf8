 Tuesday, August 19, 2003 				 Schoolgirl knocked off fathers scooter dies
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Purabi Shaw, 11, who was on her way to school on her fathers two-wheeler, was knocked down and killed by a private bus on route 78/1 on BT Road, close to Cossipore police station, around 6 am on Monday. 																								Purabi, a Class V student of a local Hindi-medium school, Adarsha Hindu Vidyamandir, was taken to RG Kar Hospital, where doctors pronounced her brought dead. 																								Local people told Cossipore police station officers that the private bus was forced to take a sharp turn to avoid a herd of cattle and this may have resulted in the accident. The driver of the bus fled with his vehicle.																								Purabis father, Sanju Prasad Shaw, 40, is a kerosene dealer on Deshabandhu Road (East) of Bonhooghly. He, too, was knocked down from his scooter and sustained serious injuries. 																								Local people and policemen rushed them to RG Kar Hospital. After first-aid there, Shaw was admitted to a private nursing home at Beleghata. He is in a very serious condition, police said. 																								The stretch of BT Road, where the accident occurred, was almost deserted, save a few vehicles. Local people tried to block the road but we reached the spot almost immediately after the accident, said officer-in-charge Anil Jana of Cossipore police station.																								A minibus was parked across the road in an attempt to block the stretch. This disrupted traffic for a brief spell, but commuters were not inconvenienced, as it was still quite early in the day.

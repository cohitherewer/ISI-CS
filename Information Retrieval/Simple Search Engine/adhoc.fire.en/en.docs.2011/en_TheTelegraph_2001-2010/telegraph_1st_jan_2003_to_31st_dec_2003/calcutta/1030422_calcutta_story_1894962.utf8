The Telegraph - Calcutta : Calcutta
 Star Spot
 upcoming sarod player. The days where talent is judged by genealogy have passed, says the 24-year-old who has moved with his melody from stage to stage, country sarod to make the fingerboard thinner and more accessible to those with smaller hands, without tampering with the sound. A more dynamic and flexible instrument is what he is hoping to create. Arnab, who grew up in Mumbai though is now settled in Calcutta, has also experimented with his own version of fusion. While a student of international relations and music at Hampshire College, Massachusetts, he ganged up with two guys  a guitarist and banjo player  for the Srutidarpan project, scholarship to study abroad. He was also awarded a Junior Fellowship in Music by the ministry of human resources, India. Arnabs done his time to prove his worth. Starting out with music at the age of three, the tabla and vocals were his first love. Moving on to the complicated sarod, he had his first stage performance at 13. He has since taken a bow at the United Nations, New York, the Nehru Centre, the National Centre for the Performing Arts and at the IMG-Britannia Young Masters 90 concerts last year in India, the US and Europe. This year Arnab is headed for South Africa and New Zealand. Passed up a job at Goldman Sachs and a berth at Princeton post-grad to go on tour. Calcutta should get to see him in action at a couple of audio recordings in the pipeline. He is working on the score of a documentary for which shooting in the city is to commence soon.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								6The fearful fact: The school-going child comes down with a mild cough for two days. The cough gets worse, followed by acute respiratory distress. Swallowing is painful, urination is infrequent, the condition deteriorates rapidly. Diagnosed as bronchial pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis or a disease of the lower respiratory tract by another name, the child is hospitalised, put on an artificial respirator and pumped with antibiotics.																								6The fearful figure: A World Bank study, carried out in 1991-92, pegged the number of air pollution-related premature deaths in the city at 5,726 and the number requiring hospitalisation and other medical assistance at 30 lakh. 																								Four years later, a study carried out by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) showed a rise of the respective data to 10,647 and 55 lakh. And the fume-fallout count is said to be rising daily, despite an industrial clean-up and because of no steps being taken yet to curb vehicular pollution.																								With wheelers four and three and vehicles big and small belching out smoke that none of us deserves to breathe in, the city streets have become serious health hazards (see box). And the young ones suffer the most.																								Diseases like bronchial asthma and others have increased significantly over the years. During these winter months, due to high level of air pollution, the number of cases with respiratory problems could be 70 per cent or more, says paediatrician Tridib Banerjee. Previously, oral treatment was adequate for most of these cases, but now, many of them have to be put on inhalers and, if required, hospitalised and put on nebulisers, he adds.																								The foul-air scare for the schoolchild was mirrored by a state environment department-funded study carried out jointly by the state pollution control board and Jadavpur University, near a number of schools. A majority of the respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in the city air was found to be 3.3 microns or less, small enough to reach the innermost areas of the lungs brochii and alveoli  causing irreparable damage.																								Paediatrician Subhomoy Mukherjee highlights the urban-semi urban divide when it comes to the effects of pollution on children: About three-fourths of the cases from September to January involve respiratory trouble, while the proportion is reversed as soon as you step outside the city. And what is most disconcerting is the fact that the younger the child, the greater its vulnerability to such diseases.																								But the fact that our children are being choked is an emergency that must be tackled immediately. It is already too late, warns a doctor dealing closely with the health horrors of air pollution.																								The incidence of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) has risen alarmingly among urban dwellers, which can only be ascribed to industrial and vehicular pollution. The problem gets even worse in winter, with many patients requiring hospitalisation, observes Parthasarathi Bhattacharyya, director, Institute of Pulmocare amp; Research.

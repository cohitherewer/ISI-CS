 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								Calcutta received its first hailshower on Thursday evening, sending home-bound commuters scurrying for cover. Hailstones with the circumference of five-rupee coins were reported from Lake Town and Moulali.																								Weather officials said there were chances of a thunderstorm on Friday, too. In north and central parts of the city, a Norwester raged at 51 kph, accompanied by lashing rain and hailstones.

Deputy director-general of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore, R.N. Goldar, said Thursdays squall was heavier in north and central Calcutta. The intensity of the Norwester was less in Alipore and the weather office recorded 12.6 mm of rain till 8.30 pm, an official said.																								Goldar said a trough of low pressure lay over central India till south Bengal, across Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. This, along with an upper-air circulation over Jharkhand, caused Thursdays Norwester. On Friday, there are chances that the sky will remain cloudy and it may rain, he added.																								Thursday was very humid in the morning.

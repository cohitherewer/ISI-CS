	I had a shocking experience in a Kasba-Rathtala-Howrah  minibus recently. As the bus was speeding along the Kasba  flyover, I heard the beep of a cellphone and thought it  to be one of my co-passengers. Just then, the driver started  chatting on a cellphone with one hand on the steering wheel.  The police must immediately put a ban on using cellphones  while driving. Such callousness can jeopardise lives.

	Residents of north Howrah are being extremely inconvenienced  due to the one-way traffic system on GT Road. Those travelling  to south Howrah from Liluah or Salkia have to take a long,  circuitous route via Howrah Road, which is a waste of both  time and money. Most of the time, a few policemen can be  spotted roughing up rickshaw-pullers, who ferry people to  Salkia. The cops deflate the tyres of their vehicles and  often chop them into pieces. Such misuse of power must be  stopped.  
	B.L. Chandak, Salkia.

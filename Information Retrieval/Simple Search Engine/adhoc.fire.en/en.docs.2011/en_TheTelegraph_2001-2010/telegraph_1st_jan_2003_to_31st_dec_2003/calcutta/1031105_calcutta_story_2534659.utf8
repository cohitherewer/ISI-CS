The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, November 05, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Several shopping malls and entertainment centres have come up on Elgin Road, but the condition of the footpaths on either side of the road is pathetic as well as dangerous. Registration charges and municipal taxes generated from these buildings must be pretty high and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation can comfortably mend the stretch. The contrast is so glaring that it can be compared to a patch on a designer suit. The charm of a jaunt at these sites will soon start to wane.				 																																									Govind Das Dujari,				 																																									Behala.				 																																									The stretch between Salkia Chowrasta and Bandaghat has been converted into a garbage dumping ground. Heaps of litter lie strewn on the road. Crows and strays scatter the dump, posing a health hazard to the surrounding area. The garbage-disposal truck of the Howrah Municipal Corporation parks itself in the middle of the road, bringing the traffic to a standstill. I urge the authorities to do the needful.				 																																									B.L. Chandak,				 																																									Salkia.

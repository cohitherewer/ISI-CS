																								Music encompasses an entire gamut of human emotions. It is not only a source of aesthetic fulfilment for all but an effective means of communication. Contemporary Bengali theatre, as we witness now, is an offshoot of theatre  a novel form of entertainment of colonial Bengal that came into being in the mid-18th century. Since its inception, music formed an integral part of Bengali theatre irrespective of the subject of the productions. The songs or gaan straddled the theatre and Jalsaghar to express myriad emotions, reconcile conflicts and even prepare for a grand climax. In the process, a rich genre of theatre songs or mancha-gaan was born. Jalsagharer Manchagaan aims to portray the various trends of the musical compositions of manchagaan of the 19th and 20th centuries when the nautch girls were instrumental in bringing about a socio-cultural change. Drawing upon research in recordings, notations, prompt books and clippings, this documentation offers an exciting and altogether original view of artistic transgression from life to stage. Drawing upon extensive research, this production aims to present a grand narrative of the two centuries. Presented by Bratati Bandyopadhyay, Riddhi Chattopadhyay and Devajit Bandyopadhyay, this is an Academy Theatre production.

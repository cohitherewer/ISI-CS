 SWATI SENGUPTA			From cookbook to history book,  the tide is turning for some of our favourite fish.																								If a survey conducted at the behest of the Left Front government is to be believed, the staple fare on the Bengali table may be under not-so-distant threat. For, mouth-watering delicacies  pabda machher jhal, chitol machher muithya and all  may soon be confined to family lore, rather than the lunch table, if the government continues to let things drift.																								The survey conducted by Aquatech Popularisation Society makes no bones about the fact that several fishes are in danger of becoming extinct, if nothing is done to improve the states sweet-water rivers, lakes, estuaries and the sea. If an action plan is not worked out immediately, these will become part of the more vulnerable category preceding (see box) it in a decade or two, warns project in-charge P. Das. 																								If the NGOs researches are warning of a fish fadeout now, retailers and wholesalers have been watching the vanishing act for a while. I havent seen a chandana ilish, katkoi or batasi tangra in the past five years, says Abdul Hamid, a fishmonger at College Street market. 																								The supply of essentially Bengali fishes, not found anywhere else in the country and used in the most Bengali of homes, has all but stopped, adds Ajit Niyogi, a supplier to south Calcutta markets.																								And the Bengali gourmet is slowly resigning himself to life without some of thakumas special fish fare. We used to love this fish called bhagna in our childhood. Even nyadosh and kholshey were favourites. Where have they gone? asks Bhupen Saha, associated with Prince Restaurant, on Mirza Ghalib Street.																								Mourala is becoming unaffordable because there are so few, complains bank employee Kushal Chakraborty, a regular visitor to the Maniktala fish market.																								Tangra, too, is vanishing fast. And guley machh bhaja is not to be found in any restaurant This generation hasnt heard of half the fishes that we grew up on. All it knows is hilsa and prawn, he grumbles.																								Destruction of habitat, pollution, silting, loss of salinity in estuaries, loss of river-depth caused by deforestation, multipurpose river-valley projects and indiscriminate fishing have caused changes in breeding habitats. Not all species have been able to adapt to such changes.																								Implementation of the Indian Fisheries Act has failed here, like many other states in the country, but Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh have dealt with it very well, says Das, who steered the study of diminishing trend in species diversity of fish in West Bengal for evolving conservation strategies.																								Bengal contributes 694 species of fish, of the national total of 2,200 (the global figure stands at 20,000). This share may fall further if something is not done soon to recognise and address the problem of the dwindling fish population, warns Das.

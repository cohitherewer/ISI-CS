																									madhumita das																									Is how this Sagittarian describes herself. While it fits in with her future plans as an intrepid traveller, the description disguises her true nature  one of a hard worker and an achiever. Proof of that lies in the student of St Thomas Girls Schools academic record, with 90 per cent-plus marks in several subjects in her Class X board exams. The credit list includes the Jeanne DAbreau Memorial Prize for highest marks in English in school.																									And sometimes queen bee, is Mini. She has her hands full, working for the greater good, be it of animals or children. The 16-year-old cares for strays in her locality, through neighbourhood NGOs. The founder of a temporary Nature Club in school tried to spread a little love for animals by conducting pet shows. The Interact Club is her vehicle of social service. The former Inter Club Relations Co-Chairperson roped in the 20 schools and conducted projects ranging from food, medicine, clothes and stationery distribution to free health check-up camps.																									Is Mads. She has a finger in every pie, from debating and drama to quizzing and writing. The avid quizzers crowning glory was receiving an award from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for coming third at the inter-school contest organised by the state forest department. The SpicMacay member has received accolades for several drama competitions, be it acting, writing or directing. The accomplished elocutionist has also won awards for dance and fashion shows on the inter-school fest circuit. And although debating is a newly-discovered passion, shes off to a flying start, having made it to the state level this year.																									Is what the Class XII student of humanities aims to be, and is honing her writing skills with The Telegraph in Schools. Had a poem selected by www.poetry.com for publication in their compilation Under a Quicksilver Moon, last year. Represents her school regularly at writing contests, winning laurels along the way. The amateur guitarist is off to Delhi next year, to get a headstart on her dream of hosting her own television travel show. Till then, the search is on for the next challenge.

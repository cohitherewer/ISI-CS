The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
 Letters
  It is really appaling that the postal authorities could take such a casual approach to a letter from the President of India, no less (Late letter: Presidential speed post does a snail mail, Metro, May 21). The Presidential insignia embossed on the envelope should have alerted them about the sender. Moreover, it was sent by speed post, which is supposed to travel from one metro to another within 24 hours. Postal authorities are blaming two holidays in between for the delay. Why could they not deploy a special messenger to deliver the letter? The President might forgive the postal department, but the department should realise that people will lose faith in the speed post service, causing a dent in its business. The message going out to the masses is if a Presidential letter could meet with such a fate, normal letters do not stand a chance. The postal department should also remember that all speed post letters are important. They can contain documents ranging from interview letters for jobs to tenders for contracts. The late delivery of such letters could ruin someones career. This is why important letters are sent by speed post at ten times the cost of an ordinary letter. Our government should take note of this callous approach of the postal department, which is in fact helping courier companies to flourish at the expense of its own department.  Govind Das Dujari,  Behala.  Apropos the report This Winter, its Big B in Tollywood (Metro, May 14), after former Miss World Aishwarya Rai charmed the city of joy while shooting for Rituparno Ghoshs Chokher Bali, its now the turn of the biggest of them all, Amitabh Bachchan, to dazzle Calcutta for Ghoshs maiden Hindi venture. It is good to have an award-winning director who can attract the best of talent from Bollywood.  T.R. Anand,  Budge Budge.  Amitabh Bachchan is the countrys  most popular star. His signing up for Rituparno Ghoshs  first Hindi film to be made here is the best news for crisis-ridden  Tollywood. Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia  It is a matter of shame that Supreme Court guidelines and Human Rights Commission directives were disregarded by the Kasba police station on the excuse of their being short-staffed due to the panchayat elections (Vagrant dies on poll day, knotty time for red tape, Metro, May 15). The hapless New Vagrants Home authorities had to fax a complaint to the office of the district magistrate before the police accepted an FIR, more than 24 hours after the death. The Supreme Court should showcause the state administration.  Mohan Lal Sarkar,  Budge Budge.  It is good that Sajal Barui, who killed his family members, was finally nabbed by the Midnapore jailer (Jailer nails Sajal Barui, aka Sk Raju, Metro, May 17). But the reason why so many teenagers are turning to violence needs to be addressed.  Apropos the report Militant unions take toll on Hooghly units (Metro, May 19), it is distressing to note that the leaders are not able to control the trade union wings. Despite repeated appeals by entrepreneurs to check militancy, nothing has changed.  Rabindranath Thakar,  Sankar Ghosh Lane.  It is sad that Job Charnock is being disowned as our founder (Birthday bashers put on the Job, Metro, May 19). Calcutta as a metropolis was no dream come true brought about by village trader families, who never looked beyond their own narrow selfish ambitions. This exercise has created a void in the citys chronology. Do we have any alternative to offer?  Ashoke Sen Gupta,  Sonarpur.  The centre mentioned in the report Wonder pill that takes picture (Metro, May 19) will help doctors avoid surgery in complicated GI tract cases. Moreover, people will no longer have to go elsewhere for treatment.  
	Govinda Bakshi, 
	Budge Budge. When others turn away, it is best to hold each others hands (In lifes twilight, the elderly step in to help the aged, Metro, May 19)  Debaprasad Mukherjee,  Nayapatty Road.  
	Letters on reports appearing in Metro may be sent to:

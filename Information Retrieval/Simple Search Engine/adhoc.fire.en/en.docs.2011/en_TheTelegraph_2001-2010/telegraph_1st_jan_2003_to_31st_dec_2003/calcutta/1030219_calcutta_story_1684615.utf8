The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, February 19, 2003 				 Making light of Shakespeare 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Rapping Othello, presenting Titus Andronicus like a cooking show and giving Macbeth the worst Scottish accent possible is part of the challenge of The Complete Works of Shakespeare (Abridged). The longest-running comedy in London is coming to Calcutta for six shows between February 19 and 23 at G.D. Birla Sabhagar. All 37 of the Bards plays feature in the three-man, 97-minute show, with some sonnets packed in as well.																								The Australian team has actors Ezra Bix, Berynn Schwerdt and Tim Schwerdt in the lead, playing a gamut of roles, going through a multitude of costume changes (picture on right by Pradip Sanyal). We are under pressure from the word go, says Tim Schwerdt, who plays most of the women in the production. Slapstick, high-comedy and low-comedy, some improvisation and some local flavour have all been injected into the act, though the boisterous trio claims to have tried to keep the content as accessible as possible. 																								The play, brought to India by Encore Live, a Bangalore-based event management group, and supported by Hutch, has played to packed halls in Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.

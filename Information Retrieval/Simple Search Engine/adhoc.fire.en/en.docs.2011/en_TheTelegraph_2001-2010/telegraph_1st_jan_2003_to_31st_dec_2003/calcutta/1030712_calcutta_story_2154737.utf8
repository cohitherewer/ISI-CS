The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, July 12, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Sanjay Manjrekar. Your  sensitivity may lead you to help others. You are overtly  critical of yourself. You are comfortable in any company  and good at teamwork. You like to learn, see and do different  things all the time. Mental stimulation is a must for you.  You are at your best when in the spotlight.  Kusum  Bhandari

 																											- Growing tendency delays results, says CU; students cite desperation MITA MUKHERJEE																								Dont know the answers to questions in an examination? Take the answer-script home. This appears to have become a common practice among students appearing in under-graduate and post-graduate examinations of Calcutta University (CU).																								For examinees, this could be an easy solution to escape the humiliation of scoring low marks. But for the CU authorities, the tendency among examinees to leave without depositing their answer-scripts is posing a problem in the process of compilation and publication of results.																								We are accustomed to various types of mischief by students during examinations. Even two years ago, only under-graduates would leave the hall without submitting their scripts. Now, we find the same being done by students of post-graduate examinations in major subjects like MA (English) and M.Com, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, CU controller of examinations.																								Members of the universitys board of discipline  the body that deals with examination-related offences  said that even three years ago, a maximum of two to three examinees were found leaving without depositing their scripts. The tendency showed an upswing two years ago, extending to at least one examinee in almost every major under-graduate exam. This year, we found the figure has increased, with post-graduate students joining in, said an official.																								This year, an MA (English) examinee and at least two M.Com students had not submitted their scripts. According to a senior teacher of the universitys commerce department, the tendency is prevalent among low-performing students. They indulge in it deliberately to create confusion, he said.																								Students, however, say frustration drives them to it. Any examinee is well aware of the consequences of taking an answer-script home. If someone still does so, we must understand that he or she has done it out of sheer desperation, said a member of the SFI-controlled students union. 																								University sources said such an incident can be detected only after officials conducting the examination at a particular venue find after completion of the test that the number of scripts does not tally with the number of examinees at that particular centre.																								First, we file an FIR at the police station nearest to the venue. Then, the matter is referred to the universitys board of discipline. The student concerned is summoned and questioned. The process continues till the student admits his offence, explained an official. The process has to be completed before the overall results of the exam are ready for announcement. If not, the results are put on hold.

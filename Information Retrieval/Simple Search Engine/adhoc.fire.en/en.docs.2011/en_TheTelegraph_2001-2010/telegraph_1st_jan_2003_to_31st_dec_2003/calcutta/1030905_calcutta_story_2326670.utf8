The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, September 05, 2003  City of Palaces in eclipse
 The flyover on Chowringhee will destroy  forever what should have been a heritage zone long ago, says  Soumitra Das It was a tough job not to end  up wallowing in the ditch water. The slush had collected  in the deep ruts created of late for the tram tracks cutting  across Chowringhee to Dharamtala. At the same time, one  had to react instantly to keep at arms length the vehicles  that seem to bear a personal grudge against pedestrians.  Trying to cross over to the Metro cinema pavement, I wondered  if the finer sensibilities of the people who live in this  city have not become warped and blunted after the heavy  battering they take every day in all spheres of life. And now to compound our woes Chowringhee  is being disembowelled and disfigured once again so that  a flyover can be foisted on it. Everybody knows it will  not solve the citys traffic problems, and that it will  permanently blight a stretch of Calcutta that had once earned  it the sobriquet of City of Palaces. Save the Peerless Inn,  this stretch has remained almost unchanged for over 100  years. Chowringhee Mansion is an antique. The Geological  Survey of India building was constructed in 1851. The Government  College of Art amp; Craft in 1864. The Indian Museum in  1814. The YMCA building is just 100. Bible House was established  between 1820-30. A decade after the turn of the last century,  Metropolitan Building was completed. The shops, too, share  the antiquity of the buildings. Tobacconists Auddy amp;  Son opened in 1828. Paramananda Auddy still stocks tobacco  and pipes but he sells clothes on the side as well. East  India Arms Co has been around for 150 years. Grand Hotel  may have been established as late as 1938, but for the common  Calcuttan it is this establishment, and no other, that is  synonymous with luxury and splendour beyond compare.  The zone is steeped in nostalgia.  Shubho Tagore, who had shifted to Metropolitan Building  from the dovecotes of Jorasanko, wrote in his effervescent  Pansy O Piko how at Firpos he would order the boy to  fetch him a Gin and Sin. Remember Tiger Rag that they  played without fail at the cinema of that name even in the  days when it had turned into a bug-ridden black hole? Or  the cutlets at Caf de Monico? Both the cinema and restaurant  have been converted into garment sale shops. That art  deco home of Hollywood stars, which a certain generation  of Bengalis called Madro, had inspired a range of architectural  and jewellery designs labelled Metro pattern. The very  mention of Whiteway amp; Laidlaw sets in motion a train  of memories  going for bargain sales at, as the clich  goes, the most glamorous department store this side of the  Suez, heavenly teas, and the glowing stained-glass atrium  which crashed to smithereens only the other day. After years of procrastination,  the Life Insurance Corporation, which owns the near-derelict  Metropolitan Building that once housed this great store,  has undertaken restoration of the faade. Calcuttans are  intrepid, and risking the propped up balconies and the occasional  chunk of masonry hurtling down, sculptor Shankar Ghosh,  who is also a tenant, has opened his Metropolitan Art Salon  here. But by the time the makeover is over, the flyover  will have wiped out Metropolitan Building from view.  This has already happened on AJC  Bose Road. Only the dazzling white domes of Nizam Palace  peer above the brand new flyover there. A few vehicles may  zip across but the traffic is still clogged underneath. Historian Barun De comments: Some  flyovers are excellent but not all flyovers make sense.  The citys character should be understood before building  a flyover. But if they cannot maintain pavements how can  they be expected to maintain the city?  Hawkers and urchins, shadows of  once splendid buildings and unregulated traffic may have  turned Chowringhee into an impossible place but it still  retains traces of its former magic. I walked out of the  poky reception area onto the roof of Chowringhee Hotel.  There I was hemmed in by the classic Calcutta skyline. In  front soared the spire of Sacred Heart Church on Dharamtala.  Across the street were the minarets of Tipu Sultan Mosque.  Rising beyond was the theatrical dome of Victoria House,  and in startling contrast to it, the art deco Tower House.  The spell cast by this fantasmic space survived the cacophony  of traffic and humanity. For me Chowringhee is a patchwork  quilt of voices and vignettes. I met Mansura Bibi, who had  arrived there 30 years ago and is everybodys cleaning lady  now, on the porch of what was once Bristol Hotel next to  Moti Seal Street. Mansura of indeterminate age pointed out  how the huge hoardings had damaged the stucco mouldings  on the wall.  When the Josephs came to live  in Chowringhee Mansion three decades ago, Calcutta was  like London. Anthony Joseph knew all the trees in the Maidan.  The ones at the head of Park Street were all felled recently.  He is forced to keep his windows shut. Or else dust from  the excavated road below piles up on the floor of his flat.  But there is no preventive measure against the cracking  of floors and walls. The piling of the flyover pillars  has caused it, he says. Their dogs can feel the vibrations  and run from room to room like mad. I walked up the grand staircase  of the Geological Survey building. There was a power cut  but light streamed in through the atrium. The carved wooden  staircase led to a room pitch dark. The presiding officer  confides that the already damaged building is under repair.  He wonders what the eclipsed Chowringhee will look like.  The flyover is bound to obliterate this overlay of memories  and visions.  Yet in this city, where we once  used to go on a rampage because the tram fare had been hiked  by a paisa, or because the Yankees were bombing Vietnam,  nobody has made a murmur of protest. In Mumbai, however, people still  react. The city can boast 52 flyovers, but when a flyover  was proposed in swank Pedder Road its residents, including  Lata Mangeshkar, opposed it. Sharada Dwivedi, conservation  activist, says though Pedder Road itself is not a heritage  zone, Carmichael Road and Altamont Road above are, and they  are all interconnected. And as she stresses, flyovers  are only temporary measures. At the end of each flyover  there is a bottleneck, she exclaims. She could not have  been more true going by our experiences in Gariahat and  Park Circus where the flyovers have created more snarl-ups  instead of clearing them. Instead of the Chowringhee flyover,  perhaps the entry of public transport vehicles could have  been restricted, as it was once proposed. Trams could have  ferried commuters to the district. The underbelly of the  Gariahat flyover could soon turn into another shantytown.  And in Chowringhee, perhaps, hawkers and urchins will usurp  the space underneath. And nobody would dare to alienate  this vote bank.

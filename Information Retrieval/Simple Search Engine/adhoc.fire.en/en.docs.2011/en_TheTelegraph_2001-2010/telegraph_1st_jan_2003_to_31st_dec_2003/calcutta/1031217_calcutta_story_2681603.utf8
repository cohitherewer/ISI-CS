 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Pauper twins in tax wrangle
 SANJAY MANDAL																								Salt Lakes cash-starved civic body has suffered a body blow to its coffers, dealt by yet another cash-strapped public sector undertaking  Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL).																								Peeved over the amount of accumulated tax, Bidhannagar Municipality will dash off a pay-up notice to the telecom authorities, themselves in a financial soup after incurring a loss of Rs 77 crore in the last fiscal.																								BSNLs West Bengal Circle Telecom Training Centre, in Salt Lakes GB Block, has run up a tax bill of Rs 5 lakh. We have not received any money from them. We will serve them an ultimatum, said municipality chairman Dilip Gupta. Civic officials said the earlier bills sent to the telecom authorities had elicited no payment. This inaction is unfortunate. They must clear their dues immediately, Gupta added.																								BSNL officials, while admitting there were some dues, said there had been no communication from the municipality. Previously, it referred the outstanding amount to us and we had sent our reply. But after that, there was no word from them, said P. Paul Williams, deputy general manager (administration), BSNL West Bengal Telecom.																								Now that we have conveyed that there have been some civic amenity shortcomings, they have raised the dues issue again, Williams said. But talks are in the offing and we are hopeful about the outcome, he added. 																								BSNL set up the training centre to impart refresher courses to its employees and train junior telecom officers recruited through the UPSC. In November 2002, BSNL opened its mobile switching centre for the CellOne service. Sources said the building houses the billing office of nearly five lakh CellOne subscribers across eastern India.																								Also on the municipalitys list of defaulters are several central offices and housing estates. We will serve notices on them to generate more income, chairman Gupta said. The annual tax target this year is over Rs 7 crore. In the past six months, Rs 3 crore have been collected. Our income from taxes has increased considerably after a drive against defaulters. We want to continue with it, an official said. 																								The civic body has expressed its helplessness in dealing with defaulters. We can only slap notices. Legal action is not viable, said an official. It is also difficult to disconnect water supply and civic amenities, as these are essential services, he added.

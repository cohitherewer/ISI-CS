 Wednesday, October 08, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Sigourney Weaver You  are bright, enthusiastic and energetic. You are quick in  your thinking. Your confidence makes you stand up for yourself  against all odds. You like to plumb the depths of matters  for a better understanding of life. You get along best with  those who are high-spirited. You have tremendous strength  of character. Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 17, 2003  To be Tagores neighbour
 Marwari and upcountry culture dominates  this part of Chitpur. The most famous Bengali was also born  here, says Soumitra Das, in the second part of the  series Clanging in vain, a tram tries  to plough through a solid mass of cars, trucks, hand-pulled  rickshaws and cycle vans that stand in its way. Vehicles  parked double file block the right side of Chitpur (Rabindra  Sarani), too, while piles of trash have accumulated along  the sidewalks. Peddlers and food vendors have very thoughtfully  left some space for pedestrians to squeeze though on the  pavements. The strong smell of chickpea flour  spiced with asafoetida and red hot chillies being stir-fried  on a coal-fired oven (these are supposedly banned) overpowers  the olfactory sense, as does the stench of leaking sewage  lines that trickle down pavements. Chitpur is the last bastion of  the tram and of ye olde Calcutta. The track began  in Galiff Street and continued straight up to Tollygunge.  Now the tracks terminate at Lalbazar and take a sharp turn  to Dalhousie Square. The destination of these vehicles that  have fallen out of favour could be made out by the colour  of their lights. They used to be punctual and the conductors  were uniformed in spotless khaki. Those who built these once-noble  houses must have been blessed with a tremendous sense of  space. The courtyards are large and so are the rooms. The  ornaments are showy  heavy stucco, Rajasthan cement jali  and wooden screens with filigree work. The architectural  style is flamboyantly eclectic  Indo-Saracenic with touches  of art deco in the most unlikely places. Lalkothi has a dramatic array  of balconies. A plastic roof covers the urns on the terrace.  The courtyard is rotting. Dinabandhu Datta in his late 40s,  who owns a 100-year-old ornament shop in this building,  says they pay their rent to Raibahadur Bangshilal Abirchand  Kasturchand Pvt Ltd based in Mumbai, but there is nobody  there to look after the house. There is no water supply  and the loos are in an unspeakable state. So they are on  a collision course over the enhanced rents demanded of late.  Ganesh Garh (called thanabari  once because of a police station inside) at the Ganesh Talkies-end  of Chitpur looks like Jaipurs Hawa Mahal recreated. Once  part of the Cossimbazar Raj Wards Estate, it has changed  hands and now the tenants are pitted in a legal battle with  the present lessee. Many of the absentee landlords  are still Bengali while the tenants are mostly Marwaris,  Gujaratis, Uttar Pradeshis and Biharis. Business is their  lifeline. As Partha Pratim Deb, dean of visual arts faculty,  Rabindra Bharati University, who has lived in the staff  quarters for 23 years, comments: They call it dhanda  and they begin from an early age. They are very orthodox  and dont believe in higher education for girls. Nowadays  when the women go out with their husbands they wear modern  dress.  The houses in which they live  look as if their nose has been dragged through dirt. This  is the saddest stretch of Chitpur. Huge rooms have been  turned into cubby holes inhabited by joint families. Glass  panes or plastic sheets have turned airy verandahs into  airtight boxes. Large plants force their way out of nooks.  As if a disintegrating heap has been patched up and held  together, or else it would explode unable to bear the burden  of years.  Here, condemned buildings are  the only refuge of daily wage-earners, sleeping without  a care in the world, a few feet away from heaps of rubble. Yet surprisingly well turned-out  people step out of buildings with forbiddingly dark entrances.  Do they want to make a virtue of parsimony? Bangur Building, at the crossing  of MG Road (Harrison Road) is Burrabazar in miniature. Like  a fortress, it has everything under one roof from textile  and sweet shops to tailoring establishments and a basa,  where for a fixed rate one can eat to ones hearts content.  There are gaddis besides. It is a male bastion, where  transactions worth several crores take place daily.  Over a century old, it belongs  to the Malliks but it was leased out for 99 years to the  eponymous mercantile family. The lease was renewed recently.  Humming with activity, it has about 360 tenants, says Sri  Narayan Garodia, in his 70s. He owns a textile shop there,  the oldest, he claims, in that neighbourhood. The building has 100 rooms, divided  and subdivided by tenants. In the huge gaddis, the  floors are lined with large mattresses covered with white  sheets. The Jain temple in bright sea  green and red dazzles in this grey scenario. Chitpur known as Tablapatti was  synonymous with musical instruments. Now it can be called  Makrana. About 50 years ago, numerous marble engraving shops  opened near Marwari Relief Society. These traders have turned  Jaipur Marble Emporium at 55/1 Upper Chitpur Road into a  marble chip godown. It used to be the Adi Brahmo Samaj building.  In keeping with the tastes of  the people who live here, this Chitpur is shakahari.  Fresh veggies are sold all along pavements. The great fruit  wholesale market Machhua is behind it, and this is perhaps  the only bazaar in Calcutta where fish is not sold. Instead,  doodhwallas ladle out milk in yard-long ribbons straight  from huge kadahis into bhands for hundreds  of consumers at every streetcorner shop. Dingy eateries  sell dal, bhat, sabzi and bhujiya.  To be radically different one can opt for vegetable chowmin. Yet one cant miss the kiosks  selling boiled and fried eggs. Have they turned eggatarians  on the sly? However, the smalltime shopkeepers  who sell spices and puja provisions are still Bengali. The  flower shops of Phool Katra are also owned by members of  the latter community. Murari Pramanik, 48, says his establishment  dates back to pre-Partition days. The tiles with daffodils  and peacocks belong to those times. Then I met the amazing Madhusudan  Roy, 74, in Jorasanko Roy House. The Tagores used to be  his neighbour, and memories of his friendship with Abanindranths  grandson Badsha (Sumitendra Tagore) are still fresh in his  mind. The house that the Tagores used as their kitchen  was next to ours. We used to call it Pirilibari. I was only  12 then but I remember the hall in which plays were staged  with its amazing flight of staircases. Roy acquired the 51 ft by 22 ft  pile carpet laid out in that hall and it is still in his  possession. Did he ever see Rabindranath? Oh yes, he answers  readily. He used to be in his robes. After a pause, he  gradually recalls how the Tagore bastion used to extend  right up to the middle of Madan Chatterjee Lane, where their  shrine was situated. Their household deity was Lakshmi  Janardan and all their marriages were held before the image.  The shrine still exists in the middle of Madan Chatterjee  Lane opposite Panchi Dhobani Gulee. Hanuman is the presiding  deity now. Concluding next week

 Sunday, May 04, 2003 				 Mayor measure for property tax
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee will place a proposal before the state government for implementing area-wise property tax in the city. The proposal is being prepared on suggestions and recommendations by the Central government, British funding agency DFID and a city expert.																								I want the property tax to increase by two per cent after a general review every year, said mayor Mukherjee on Saturday. He expects the state government to make the changes in the existing law, which are essential for collecting property tax efficiently. The mayor hopes the proposal to be passed in the next Assembly session.																								At present, the Calcutta Municipal Corporations (CMC) property tax collection is much less than the target total of Rs 603 crore in the city. A four-member committee formed recently has been asked to review the situation and send reminders to house-owners who have avoided paying property tax for a long time. At least 35 per cent property in the city still remains unassessed.

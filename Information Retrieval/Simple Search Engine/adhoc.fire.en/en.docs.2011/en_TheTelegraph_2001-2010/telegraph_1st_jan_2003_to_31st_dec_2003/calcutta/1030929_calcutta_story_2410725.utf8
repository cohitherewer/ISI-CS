								Diptimoy Ghosh: What is the strength of CTCs operational staff? Do you plan to sell the excess land at your depots?																																																													Going by the standard manpower ratio, the CTC is shortstaffed. We have not had any recruitment for some years now though we need some specialised staff. Many key posts are vacant. Moreover, with an increase in the number of tramcars, we will need more staff. To date, there has been no directive from the state government on selling excess land at the depots. In fact, we plan to modernise the depots on the land we have.

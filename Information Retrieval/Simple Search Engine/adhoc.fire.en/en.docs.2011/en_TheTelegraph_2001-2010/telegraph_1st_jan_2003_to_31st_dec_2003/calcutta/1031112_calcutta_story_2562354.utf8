 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 Six students in Tangra still missing
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Six students of two schools in Tangra, missing since Monday, could not be traced till late on Tuesday. A search is on and the district police have been alerted.																								We are yet to locate the boys. A search is on, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner (detective department), on Tuesday. Police are keeping a vigil on all trains leaving Sealdah and Howrah stations, he said.																								The six boys, students of Classes IX and X of Sanat Ray High School and another school in Tangra, have been missing since Monday morning. Police said the boys left home for school but did not arrive there. When they did not return home in the evening, some of the parents lodged missing diaries at Tangra and Tiljala police stations. 																								Tangra police station officials admitted that the parents of Subhankar Das, Sujay Pal and Bapi Pramanik had filed complaints, but there were no diaries for the other three. Police suspect the students may have gone off somewhere together.																								Local councillor Javed Khan said residents of the area were making independent inquiries about the boys whereabouts. We know two of them are from Tangra, Khan said. The others are from elsewhere. Tiljala, I think. Khan said he was surprised that all the parents had not filed complaints with the police. We would have expected them to be a little more concerned and seek police help in tracing the boys. But this has not been the case so far, he added.

 Wednesday, April 23, 2003 				 Pump station trio to tackle southern surge
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will unveil three new water-lifting stations in the city to keep it free from waterlogging in the monsoon ahead. One station is ready on Southern Avenue and will be opened shortly, after mayor Subrata Mukherjee returns to Calcutta from Mexico. 																								The other two stations will be at Katapukur and Majherhat. All three stations will pump out accumulated rainwater from the southern parts of the city and discharge it into Tollys Nullah. 																								At present, there are 18 such pumping stations across the city. The addition of these three will facilitate quick and effective drainage during the monsoon.																								Mayor-in-council (drainage) member Rajib Deb said on Tuesday that the civic body also had two jetting-cum-suction machines on stand-by. These will work in addition to the pumping stations in case of heavy rain in the city. The machines will be brought from Chennai. We cant prevent waterlogging, but we can take measures to pump out the water as quickly as possible by deploying such machines, in addition to the pumping stations, which will work all day and night in case of emergency. Waterlogging will not pose a serious problem any longer in Calcutta, Deb asserted.																								Two pumps, with a capacity of drawing out 240 cusecs of water a second, have been installed at the Southern Avenue station, built at Rs 4 crore. The other two stations will cost around Rs 8 crore, Deb said. 																								Civic officials in the drainage department said eight municipal wards in the southern side of the city will benefit after the three new stations are commissioned. The areas include Southern Avenue, Lake Gardens, parts of Golf Green,the entire stretch of Rashbehari Avenue, Gariahat Road (South), Panchanantala (near Dhakuria), Jadavpur and Bejoygarh, apart from added areas like Behala and Garden Reach. 																								The CMC had earlier set up similar lifting stations at Ultadanga and Kankurgachhi. This had reduced waterlogging in the area. We are ready to open the station on Southern Avenue. We are waiting for the mayor to reach Calcutta and inaugurate it, Deb said on Tuesday.

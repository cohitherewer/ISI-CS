 Monday, February 17, 2003 				 Earthworm protest, rally halt traffic
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two hundred residents of Beleghata, protesting against an earthworm flowing out of a Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) tap, and a religious procession along central and south Calcutta crippled traffic on Sunday.																								Lalbazar traffic department officials said the protesters squatted at the intersection of Beleghata Main Road and Radhamadhab Dutta Garden Lane on Sunday afternoon to protest against an earthworm and insects flowing out of CMC taps.																								The insects have been dropping out of our taps for the past couple of days. We had informed the local councillor and senior CMC officials but they have not taken any action so far, said Sanatan Das, of the Chaulpatti area. Kumari Saha, another local resident, wanted deputy commissioner of police, eastern suburban division, Sanjay Mukherjee, to arrive and personally address their problem. Mukherjee could not make it to the spot. Beleghata police rushed to the spot to persuade the demonstrators to clear the road. Police admitted that traffic in east and central Calcutta was severely affected for a couple of hours. 																								A procession by followers of Sant Rabidas passed through Lalbazar, Central Avenue, Park Street and other areas, blocking traffic. Police said it was a huge rally and vehicles stood bumper-to-bumper for over an hour in central and south Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Seven years on, no sign of college hall
 A STAFF REPORTER																								This is probably one of the few projects stalled in the state  not for the want of cash. An allocation of Rs 4 lakh by three members of Parliament (MPs), including a Union minister notwithstanding, an auditorium at Sarojini Naidu College for Women, in Dum Dum, is yet to be built.																								Around seven years ago, the amount was sanctioned by the MPs from their local area development fund for setting up Sarojini Bhavan. The college authorities, too, had raised a fund worth Rs 7 lakh from students, ex-students and teachers. 																								However, construction is yet to start. We were supposed to construct a two-storeyed building, housing an auditorium on the ground floor, with several other halls for indoor games. But Rs 11 lakh is not enough for such a big project, said college principal Bonty Roy on Monday.																								Roy said she had joined the college in 2000 and the project was sanctioned in 1997. Senior officials of the district administration told us it will require at least Rs 78 lakh to complete the project. I, too, want construction to start immediately, she added.																								Former MP Gurudas Dasgupta and former MP from Dum Dum Nirmal Chatterjee had sanctioned Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh, respectively. Minister Tapan Sikdar had sanctioned Rs 1 lakh. Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty had laid the foundation stone for the proposed Bhavan in 1997, and that is where the matter rests.																								Student contributions to the fund have stopped for the past two years, to protest the delay in beginning construction. They had also submitted several memoranda to the principal, seeking measures to start work.																								College governing body president Sukumar Deb said there was no specific knowledge about the fund sanctioned by the MPs. We dont know in whose custody the money (Rs 4 lakh) is lying. Either it is with the local municipality or with the district administration. We will ask them about the money. We will also convene a governing body meeting to discuss the issue some time in January, he added.																								Like principal Roy, Deb said he had taken charge of the governing body only recently and would require some time to acquaint himself with the administrative affairs of the college.																								Gurudas Dasgupta told Metro from Hyderabad: The money had been given when I was an MP. It is unfortunate that construction has not started yet. I will inquire about the funds on my return to Calcutta. Sikdar could not be contacted in Delhi.

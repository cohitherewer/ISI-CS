 Monday, June 30, 2003 				 Community policing by the NYPD rulebook
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Community policing  a much-hyped concept during a flop project half a decade ago  is coming back in a new avatar, this time based on the New York Police Department (NYPD) model, no less. Taking a leaf out the NYPD success story, police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty has directed all deputy commissioners and other officers to focus on community policing. 																								During a crime conference held on Friday at the Lalbazar police headquarters, Chakraborty handed over all five deputy commissioners copies of a foreign journal featuring how the NYPD handles the issue.																								It is a review book published by the Harvard University Management in April 2002. I have told the deputy commissioners to implement the method, Chakraborty later asserted.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had initiated a move for community policing five years ago during his tenure as home (police) minister. Citizens committees were formed in all police station areas and officers were asked to keep in touch with residents by holding meetings on a regular basis. But the project failed because of limited manpower, said a senior officer. Chakraborty, however, rubbished the excuse.																								The NYPD has started focusing on community policing after the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center. While carrying out most major operations, criminals hide themselves in a common place and mingle with the common people. If we can build a strong bridge with the people, it will work as part of our intelligence network, the commissioner told the brass.																								The deputy commissioners have been asked to scan the speech of Raymond W. Kelly, commissioner, NYPD. We have also been told to follow the working style of John Briton, the former NYPD commissioner, who managed to control crime in 1994, said another senior officer.

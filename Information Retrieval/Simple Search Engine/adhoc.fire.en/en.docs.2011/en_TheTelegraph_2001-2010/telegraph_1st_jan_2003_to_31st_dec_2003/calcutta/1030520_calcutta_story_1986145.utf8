																																																											A  division bench of Calcutta High Court on Monday acquitted  a lifer from Purulia and a drug peddler from Howrah on legal  grounds. The drug peddler, Ramua, was arrested at Shibpur  ghat in Howrah with brown sugar in his possession. The Howrah  judge had sentenced Ramua to a 10-year term and imposed a  fine of Rs 10 lakh. His lawyer Asim Roy told the court that  the police had flouted the order of the apex court and not  informed the accused that he had the right to be searched  in the presence of a magistrate or a gazetted officer. The  court accepted the argument of the lawyer and set aside the  order of the Howrah court. In the other case, a resident of  Purulia, Pashupati Mahato, was sentenced for life by the Purulia  district judge for allegedly murdering a woman. Mahato filed  an appeal before Calcutta High court against the order of  the district judge. The same lawyer, appearing for the accused,  told the court that in 1993, when the murder was committed,  Mahato was a minor and the court had no right to send him  to jail. He argued that as per apex court ruling, the boy  should be sent to a correctional school. After receiving a  report from the district judge about Mahatos age, the division  bench comprising Justice A. Talukdar and Justice P.N. Sinha  acquitted the accused of all charges. 																																																											Two persons were run over at Barasat, in North 24-Parganas, on Sunday night.

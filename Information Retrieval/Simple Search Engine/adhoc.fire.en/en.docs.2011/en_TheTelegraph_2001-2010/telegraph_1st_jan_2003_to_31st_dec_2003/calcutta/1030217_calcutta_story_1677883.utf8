The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, February 17, 2003 				 Grain market trade bandh on Tuesday
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The foodgrain and allied wholesale markets in the city will remain closed on Tuesday, in response to a strike called by various trade associations. The one-day strike has been called to protest the corruption in sales tax and harrassment of traders.																								The major wholesale markets of Calcutta  Posta, Rajakatra, Kirana, Janbazar, Kidderpore and Shyambazar  will down their shutters, said Mahesh Singhania, chairman of the Federation of West Bengal Trade Association, on Sunday. Although the trade bandh call is statewide, the focus will be on Calcutta, a trade association official said. The decision on the bandh was taken at a meeting of trade bodies on February 14.																								Our protest is against the harassment by officials and inspectors of the sales tax department, Singhania said. These officials often raid shops and ask for money from the shop-owners. They also harass the traders in other ways, he alleged.

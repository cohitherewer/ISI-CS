The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, October 08, 2003 				 Convention tag puts cops at ease
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police have confirmed receiving a letter from the Left Front leadership informing them about Wednesdays convention at Mahajati Sadan. They have also said that a team of officers will be deployed at the venue as a precautionary measure.																								Kuldiep Singh, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) said on Tuesday that the letter of intimation has categorically stated that there will be no rallies to mark the convention.																								It is not open to all and will be attended mainly by invitees. They will either be availing of public transport to reach the venue or come in their private vehicles. We do not expect a spill-over and hope that the hall will be able to accommodate all those who will attend the meeting, said Singh, before adding that a team of police personnel would be stationed to regulate traffic in front of the hall, if required.																								The Left Front has organised the Wednesday evening convention to chalk out a protest plan against the recent order of Calcutta High Court, restricting rallies on city streets. Justice Amitava Lala had also put the onus on police not to allow weekday rallies. But Lalbazar officials said on Tuesday that since the Front convention was not a rally, the question of taking any preventive measures did not arise.																								We do not anticipate any violence or disruption, as the letter forwarded to us has nothing that we need be worried about, but we will deploy adequate personnel to ensure that things go smoothly, stated Singh. We will also make essential parking arrangements for the guests to park their vehicles, he added.

 Sunday, January 05, 2003 				 Warrant threat to civic body
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Its Trinamul Congress versus Trinamul Congress. 																								Having failed to realise dues to the tune of Rs 1.5 crore, the Trinamul Congress-controlled North Barrackpore municipality has decided to slap a warrant on the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), asking it to cough up the amount or face legal action. The North Barrackpore municipality will issue the warrant under Section 152 of the Bengal Municipal Act, which empowers the municipality to even confiscate the assets of the defaulter to realise the dues. 																								The CMC owes us about Rs 2 crore and we need the money to maintain civic amenities at its Palta water treatment plant, which falls in our area. Over the past five years, the CMC did not bother to pay the dues despite several reminders, said Siben Das, vice-chairman of North Barrackpore municipality. CMC officials said on Saturday that they had received a letter from the North Barrackpore municipality on December 7 regarding the warrant. We have requested the municipality not to act in haste as we are trying to clear the dues in instalments, said a CMC official.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government will encourage initiatives to open cardiac rehabilitation centres in view of increasing heart ailments resulting from stress.																								Inaugurating eastern Indias first cardio-pulmonary rehabilitation clinic at BM Birla Heart Research Centre on Saturday, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said: Although the concept of rehabilitation centres started long ago in advanced countries, it is sad that we are starting only today. Bengal requires at least 100 such centres, he added.																								Apart from common heart problems, hypertension and respiratory problems will be taken care of at the centre. Patients will be taught exercises and advised on lifestyle modifications, said managing member of the hospital M.L. Pachisia. Experts will help patients control risk factors like high blood pressure, blood sugar level, cholesterol and respiratory problems.

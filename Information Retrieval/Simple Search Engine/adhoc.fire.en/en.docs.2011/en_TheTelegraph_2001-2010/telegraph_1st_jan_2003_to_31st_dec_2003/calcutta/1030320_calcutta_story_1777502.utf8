The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, March 20, 2003 				 Call of the distant shores
 Good music has no boundaries or clans  herein lies its universal appeal. We cannot set boundaries or limitations to the act of creation. We all are intrinsically drawn towards music which is global in its outlook. Assimilating alien strains in the rich repertoire of classical Indian ragas only enrich them further. Indian classical maestros have taken our music to the farthest corners of the globe and similarly, a number of worthwhile attempts at imbibing the rich western traditions into our own have been made. Even Rabindranath Tagore was greatly influenced by Western music while composing. These creations and more will be heard this evening as the celebrated Violin Brothers  Deb Sankar and Jyoti Sankar  will render western classical and global music based on Indian ragas. They will be accompanied by Sankar Chatterjee (piano), Goutam Shome (keyboard), Sarabindu Roy, Ratul Shankar and Somnath Roy (percussion). The programme is being hosted by The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Gol Park.																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Vivekananda Hall, Gol Park

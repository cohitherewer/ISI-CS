The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, March 12, 2003 				 Medical college entry on Delhi Board quota
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Good news at last for students who missed the bus during the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) 2002 for admission into the MBBS course and, instead, had to contend with studying dental courses as the second choice. 																								Come April and at least 20 of them will be able to get admission to the MBBS course against the seats reserved for CBSE candidates. The CBSE, through an all-India JEE, sends nearly 137 candidates for admission into MBBS courses every year at various medical colleges in the city and districts. However, on most occasions, the vacancies remain, due to non-availability of suitable students. 																								Left with no alternative, the CBSE Board allows the state government to fill the seats with candidates who narrowly miss out from being included in the first batch of MBBS students and have to study dental courses.																								This year, however, the situation was a little different, as a few CBSE candidates, protesting against the Central Boards decision to allow students from the city and the rest of Bengal to take up the seats originally slated for the Central students, filed a case in the Supreme Court.																								Since the matter was in court, we couldnt admit our students in the Central seats and several of them had to study the dental course instead. But, now the court case is over and we have been given permission to use the Central Boards seats. We will hold a counselling session in mid-March for students taking admission into the MBBS course, director of medical education (DME) C.R. Maity told Metro.																								As a result, 20 students can now enter the mainstream MBBS courses from this session itself, although classes have started from last August. We dont think there will be any problems, since dental students do study anatomy and other areas of medicine, which are taught to MBBS students in the beginning, said a teaching professor of National Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday.																								Echoing the sentiments, DME Maity said that students would be asked to join the MBBS courses very soon to make up for lost time. I think they are meritorious enough to take care of any teething problems, Maity added.																								Once the counselling part is over, 20 students from the dental college in Calcutta will be able to study MBBS at various medical colleges and their positions will be taken up by students from the North Bengal Dental College. 																								Several students following the proceedings at the Supreme Court were delighted over the new development.																								CMDA top post																								The government on Tuesday appointed State Electricity Board chairman G.D. Gautama chief executive officer (CEO) of the CMDA. Sources said at Writers Buildings on Tuesday that the present CEO, Prabh Das, will be off to Delhi on deputation as joint secretary in the petroleum ministry. Sanjoy Mitra, additional resident commissioner in Delhi, will replace Gautama.

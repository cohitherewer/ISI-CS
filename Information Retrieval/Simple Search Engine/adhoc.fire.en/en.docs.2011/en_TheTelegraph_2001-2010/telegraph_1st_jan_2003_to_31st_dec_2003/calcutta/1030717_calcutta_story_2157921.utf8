 SANJAY MANDAL																								The parks of Salt Lake are set for a facelift, thanks to a project undertaken by Bidhannagar Municipality. The civic body has decided to develop the green patches as joint ventures and with the help of the ward committees. 																								We have major plans for revamping the parks through joint ventures, announced Dilip Gupta, chairman of Bidhannagar Municipality. Once the cost of developing the parks is worked out, well go into the details. A childrens corner and other equipment will also be provided, Gupta said. The civic body might give the parks and playgrounds to some private organisations to beautify and maintain them. For some parks, well seek the help of the ward committees, Gupta said.																								As a part of the project, Bidhannagar Sports Academy (BSA), a wing of the municipality, has taken up a revamp of the FC Block park and plans to develop other parks in different sectors. These will house academies for cricket, basketball and other games. We have finalised the revamp of FC Block park in Sector III. We will soon undertake projects for parks in other sectors, declared Chandan Ghosh, CPM councillor and vice-president of the academy. The BSA also runs a football academy in Central Park, opposite Bikash Bhavan.																								We will set up a cricket academy and another for football. A basketball coaching camp and other academies are also on our agenda, Ghosh said. In ward 17, which he represents, Ghosh has plans to set up chess and table-tennis academies. I have talked to some leading chess players, who are keen to guide the children. The proposal will be taken up for discussion soon , he said.																								With budding cricketers dotting the township, the authorities feel that more parks should be utilised by them. They added that since the football coaching camp was doing well  the under-19 and under-14 teams have won a number of trophies  the cricket camp could be set up on the same lines. 																								Complaints keep pouring in from residents about the neglected parks and playgrounds across the township, and the authorities have decided to attach much importance in revamping them. The parks in Sector II and III were handed over to us by the state urban development department recently, chairman Gupta said. Ignoring requests, the parks were handed over to the municipality without repairing them, the chairman complained. 																								In the current budget, we could not allot much funds but in the revised one later this year, we will be able to earmark some money for undertaking repairs at the parks, he said.

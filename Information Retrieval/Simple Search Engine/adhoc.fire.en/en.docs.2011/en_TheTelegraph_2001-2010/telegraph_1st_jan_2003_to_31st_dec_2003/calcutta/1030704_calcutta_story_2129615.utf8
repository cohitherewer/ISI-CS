	I frequently travel by state-run buses on routes S-19 and  S-23. On several occasions, I have seen the conductors collecting  a sum of Rs 5 from passengers, which is much below the actual  fare for that particular distance. They do not even issue  any tickets, especially when the buses are packed during  rush hours. Many commuters seem to encourage this practice;  some even get away by paying as paltry a sum as Rs 2 or  Rs 4. The government must immediately take steps to weed  out such corrupt employees, or else it will incur huge losses  soon.

	While walking down to my office on Shakespeare Sarani,  I often find people urinating in front of the HSBC Bank  building. But such nuisance never draws any protest. The  traffic constable posted nearby doesnt react either. Why  cant the civic authorities keep a check on this spot and  catch people dirtying the city?

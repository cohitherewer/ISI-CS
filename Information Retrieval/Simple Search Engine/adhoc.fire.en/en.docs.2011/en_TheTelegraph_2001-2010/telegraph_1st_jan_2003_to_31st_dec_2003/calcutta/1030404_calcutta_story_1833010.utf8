The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Feel Good
  There are times when one just wants to forget the tensions and worries of humdrum life and laugh. These are the feel good moments which revive the joi de vivre by looking at ourselves and society around us, through a fusion of fiction and reality. Feel Good is an outrageously funny collection of playlets directed by Sita Raina and written by Nicholas Kharkongar. It is an entertaining, snappy, simple yet meaningful play that explores the antics of the ultra-rich, high society members. Relevant, contemporary and imaginatively tied with humour, the playlets include a hilarious confusion of events  a Sardar arriving in London and then trying desperately to contact his friends, a teenage boy trying to chat up an older woman, but all his efforts lead to nought as a rude shock awaits him in the end, and a teenage daughter breaking the news of her pregnancy to her conservative mother and the publicity-hungry page-three people of Delhi. Raina says, I personally prefer wit and laughter in any situation no matter how dire it maybe. The cast includes Yuri, Roshni Chopra, Dhruv Jagasia and Raina herself. Presented jointly by Spandan and Sanskriti Sagar.When: April 5 amp; 6 at 7 pmWhere: G.D. Birla Sabhagar  Copyright

 Annya Aami
 Annya Aami (The Other Me) is neither anyones daughter nor wife or mother. A creation of her own self, she is the essence of the celestial man and woman, and is the original seed of creation. She is The Other Me. She is both the creator and destroyer, the harbinger of light and joy, and the perpetrator of all-pervading darkness. Even death concedes defeat before her, she is the eternal essence of womanhood, she is Chitrangada. This character of Mahabharata was immortalised by Tagore, who re-interpreted her in his dance drama. Danseuse Madhuboni Chatterjee feels there is a Chitrangada hiding in every woman. I have tried to capture this Chitrangada in my storyline. I even see a reflection of myself in her  the other me! The character of Chitrangada in Chatterjees choreography is not Tagores or Mahabharatas; she is born out of me as Im a woman. The choreography incorporates both the elements of Bharata Natyam and Kalaripayattu. Incidentally this is the fourth show of Annya Aami, premiered last October.When: Today at 7 pmWhere:  Copyright

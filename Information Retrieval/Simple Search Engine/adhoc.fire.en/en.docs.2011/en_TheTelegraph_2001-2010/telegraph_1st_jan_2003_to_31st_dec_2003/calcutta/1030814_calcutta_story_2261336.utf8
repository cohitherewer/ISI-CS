  Outsiders: Families of patients wait  at the entrance of a premier state-run hospital Apropos the report Transfer tussle trips hospital clear-up drive (Metro, July 9), it is shocking to learn that a Group C employee of Sambhunath Pandit Hospital had the audacity to defy his transfer to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, issued by hospital superintendent Sukumar Das. This incident undoubtedly depicts the utter helplessness of the superintendent of the hospital in executing his duty. All he was doing was implementing a government policy to overhaul the administration in hospitals by transferring Group C and D staff working for over 15 years at one place.  Moreover, it is most unfortunate that the employees union of the hospital is pressuring him to withhold the transfer order, instead of helping the administration run smoothly. The hospital staff unions should not treat the health centres as production units like factories and behave in such an irresponsible manner.  They must desist from resorting to indiscipline and the government must intervene in any incident of lawlessness in hospitals in the interest of the patients.  The fact that the health minister has sided with the superintendent will boost the morale of the states healthcare. But it is a shame that things had to reach this far (Govt sides with hospital, quashes Citu protest, Metro, July 27).  Sunil Banerjee,
 VIP Road.  It is heartening to read that hospitals in town are tying up with hotels to train their staff to serve patients with a smile. (Five-star turn to treat the sick, Metro, July 8). This will certainly speed up a patients recovery. If more hospitals learn the value of hospitality, the face of medicare in the state is bound to change.  Mohan Lal Sarkar,
 Budge Budge.  It is a novel and welcome idea  for hospitals to turn to hotels with a view to offer better  hospitality services for their patients. A human touch is  very much lacking in government-run hospitals.  Govinda Bakshi,
 Budge Budge.  The findings revealed by the survey (Small, deadly and diesel-driven, Metro, July 14)  that the Calcutta air is poisonous enough to cause irreparable damage to the lungs  are very alarming. A time-bound plan needs to be implemented immediately. User-friendly masks can be used as a short-term solution, though the remedy actually lies in phasing out diesel-driven vehicles.  N.S. Ramakrishnan,
 E.M. Bypass.  The article (Chores, shoots and fond memories, Metro, July 14) revealed some interesting aspects of Supriya Devis personality. The veteran actress won our hearts with her brilliant performance in Ritwik Ghataks Meghe Dhaka Tara and several other box-office hits.  Bhupen Bose,
 Dum Dum Park.  The report (Storm signal over Urdu bar in B. Ed, Metro, July 3) has sent shockwaves through the Urdu-speaking community in the state and shaken its confidence in the Calcutta University (CU) authorities. I am also a product of Calcutta University. I got my masters degree in Urdu in the late Sixties and completed the B.Ed course in the early Seventies. The syllabus, with negligible changes, is the same. One wonders why and how the CU authorities, after decades, came to the conclusion that there are certain deficiencies in the contents of the BA (honours) and MA (Urdu) syllabi. And, on the basis of this, they promptly decided to stop such students from studying the B.Ed course. The CU authorities should have first referred the case to those framing the syllabus or the head of the Urdu department. This decision is arbitrary and prejudiced.  Muhiuddin Shaheen, 
 Dargah Road.  The government of West Bengal  has already debarred Urdu-speaking students from competing  in the WBSC examination by making Bengali compulsory for  its examinees. This policy further narrows the scope for  teaching in government-aided schools. Such discriminatory  policy is also against the spirit of the Indian Constitution.  Md. Moinuddin, 
 Jamadar Khan Lane.

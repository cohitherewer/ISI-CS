 A STAFF REPORTER			A spot-fine system will be enforced  from September 15 to regulate pedestrian movement. This  move, a first of sorts in the history of the city police,  has been initiated to bring down the fatality rate on roads.																								In the first phase, a 10-day awareness campaign will be launched from September 5, announced Sandhi Mukherjee, special additional commissioner of police (traffic). 																								After that, anyone found violating traffic rules while crossing a road will be booked under the Calcutta Police Act, 1866, and fined Rs 50. For this, we have targeted 16 key areas across the city, Mukherjee said.

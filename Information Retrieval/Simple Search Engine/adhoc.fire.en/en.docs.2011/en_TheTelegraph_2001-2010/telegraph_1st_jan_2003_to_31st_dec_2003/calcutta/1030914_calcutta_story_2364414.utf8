 Sunday, September 14, 2003 				 Two held in fake coin factory bust
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Police unearthed a fake coin-manufacturing factory at Sankrail in Howrah district on Saturday and arrested two persons in this connection. 																								Acting on a tip-off, Sankrail police contacted Karan Prasad Thakur and Tayab Ali, posing as clients. They booked a machine for manufacturing fake coins of Rs 5 and paid Rs 1.5 lakh for it, said Zulfiquar Hasan, superintendent of police, Howrah.																								Officer-in-charge of Sankrail police station Nirmal Jash visited the factory in plainclothes and even discussed the process of manufacturing with Thakur and Ali. Within five minutes, a large contingent of policemen surrounded the factory premises and rounded up Thakur and Ali, added Hasan. During interrogation, the police came to know that Thakur and Ali had come to the city from Bihar a few years ago. They started off by preparing fake stickers of some reputed brands. Recently, they started the fake coin business, the police officer added.																								Several machines for manufacturing fake coins were confiscated during the raid. A preliminary investigation revealed that the machines were brought to the city from Bihar and some of these were supposed to be ferried to other coin manufacturing units across the state, said officers of Sankrail police station.																								According to police, Thakur and Ali have already supplied some machines to the districts where a racket in the manufacturing of fake coins is thriving. We are interrogating the duo to find out the places where they have supplied the machines, said Hasan, adding that more raids will be conducted soon.

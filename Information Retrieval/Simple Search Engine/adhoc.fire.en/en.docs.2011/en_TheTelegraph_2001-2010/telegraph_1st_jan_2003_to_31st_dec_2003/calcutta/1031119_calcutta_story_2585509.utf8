	Jessore Road, scarred with craters, is dangerous for travel.  A patient, if rushed to a hospital along this stretch, is  sure to succumb to the bumpy ride. As goods vehicles travel  along this road, it needs regular repairs.

	Every year in the winter, different species of migratory  birds used to flock to the citys wetlands and to the Alipore  zoo. But the number has dropped sharply over the years and  bird hunters are largely responsible for it. The authorities  must make efforts to check this.

	T. Datta, Kankulia Road.

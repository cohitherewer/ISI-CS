 Friday, August 08, 2003 				 The Dolls Speak
 When you made the world,/ what did you want?/ That your love, and justice / to the world expand?/ When I make these Dolls,/ Nothing more do I seek,/ Than of Thy forgotten love/and justice/ the Dolls should speak.  Francoise Bosteels																								Bosteels is a Belgian by birth who has been residing in India for the last 30 years and working in the villages of south India as a health worker. Here she was inspired to create dolls. But her dolls are not the conventional ones  cute and cuddly models for children to play with. Rather, her creations are a chilling subversion of the popular form, as she explains, These dolls I make depict human toil and bondage, in the greater part of the world I see today. May they whisper a strong and silent message to those who seek a better world, I pray. Her dolls represent phases of human conditions and facets of domestic and social life as she observed while interacting with the locals. These dolls guide us to a deeper awareness of the other India. We often overlook the plethora of dichotomies and paradoxes that exist in our country, and these dolls chronicle them as they speak to us in a language that appeals to both the head and the heart. 																								When: Till August 10; 12 noon - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, New South Gallery

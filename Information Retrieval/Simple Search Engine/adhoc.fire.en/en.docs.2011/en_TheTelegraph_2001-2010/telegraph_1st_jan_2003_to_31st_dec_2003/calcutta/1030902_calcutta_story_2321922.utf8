The Telegraph - Calcutta : Calcutta
		 Tuesday, September 02, 2003  Star Spot
 Kasturi Mishra																									Is the way she likes to be. This sprightly 23-year-old has a penchant for dance and music, of any type. Although trained in kathak, shes also tried a hand, and leg, at Odissi, Bharatanatyam, folk and western dances. The applause and accolades earned at St James School fests to Calcutta Medical College cultural dos are testimony to her talent.																									In her dancing styles. She has won top prizes in both categories, at school and college fests. The ex-student of Abhinav Bharti has the talent in her genes, father Pandit Bachan Lal Mishra being her teacher till last year. Now, shes student and tutor at Pandit Chitresh Das school, Nritya Bharati. Her source of inspiration and encouragement is her mother.																									She has travelled, performing with success in small towns and big cities. In her kitty are solo show credits at Kala Kunj and Kala Mandir right here in Calcutta, and inter-college competitions at Symbiosis and even Yeshukrisht Jayanti in Bangalore, among others. The three-time winner at Xavotsav first hit the limelight in the school fest circuit during her Ashok Hall days.																									Are now her two passionate pursuits. The graduate of mass communication and videography from St Xaviers College has acted in SRFTI projects and other student films. But its behind the camera that Kasturi prefers to stay when it comes to films. After several amateur productions, shes ready for the bigger picture.																									In the big league is what shes hoping for. Currently working as a researcher and scriptwriter at the Educational Media Research Centre, affiliated to SXC, shes busy focussing on educational films. Hands-on experience in editing is what shes hoping for. With a degree in editing from SRFTI, where she wants to apply next year, Kasturi is convinced her future lies in documentary and non-fiction film-making. 																									Is what she hopes to achieve, between dancing and film-making, with an eye on the professional stage. But while she puts in about 12 hours a week in practice, it is the enjoyment of dancing for herself that she cherishes the most. And her aim is to pass on this skill to future generations.

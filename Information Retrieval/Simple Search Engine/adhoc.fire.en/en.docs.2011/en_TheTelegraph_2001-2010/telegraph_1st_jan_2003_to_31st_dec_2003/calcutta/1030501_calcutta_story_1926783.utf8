 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 Doctor ouster case setback 
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday dismissed US-based doctor Kunal Sahas petition for removal of Dr Ashok Chowdhury from the post of president, West Bengal Medical Council. The division bench of Justices Ashok Ganguly and Hrishikesh Banerjee upheld the observation of Justice K.J. Sengupta, not finding enough grounds in Sahas plea for Chowdhurys removal.																								Saha told Metro over the telephone from the US that he would move the Supreme Court against the order. Wednesdays judgment also upholds the West Bengal Medical Councils decision to acquit three doctors  Sukumar Mukherjee, Abani Roy Chowdhury and Baidyanath Haldar  on charges of negligence in the treatment of Anuradha Saha, Kunals wife. 																								According to legal experts, if the division bench had allowed the Saha appeal, the hearing and the judgment by the Council would have to be declared null and void, as Ashok Chowdhury had presided over the committee assigned for hearing Sahas application. Saha had prayed before the medical council for action against the three doctors he claimed were responsible for his wifes death. Saha wanted the council to cancel their licences.																								After filing the petition before the medical council, Saha feared he would not get justice from the doctors if Chowdhury headed the fact-finding committee. So, he filed a case at Calcutta High Court, demanding Chowdhurys removal. 																								After his wifes death, Saha had filed cases at three separate forums  the judicial forum, consumer forum and the medical forum. In the judicial forum, Saha won a major victory when a sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Alipore sentenced two doctors  Sukumar Mukherjee and Baidyanath Haldar  for negligent treatment. The court, however, acquitted Abani Roy Chowdhury of the charges.																								Saha filed a case in Calcutta High Court seeking stronger sentences for Mukherjee and Halder and the inclusion of Roy Chowdhury in the list of accused doctors. His appeal is pending. In the consumer court, his application for adequate compensation is still pending.																								Saha asserted: I am not bothered by what the high court has to say. The order is my ticket to the Supreme Court, where I will get justice. He said the Medical Council of India had already started hearing his case against the state medical council. Counsel for the state council Saibalendu Bhowmik, however, was confident the apex court would uphold the trial court verdict.

Subramaniam and French electric violin wizard JeanLuc Ponty will feature in a concert at the CC amp;FC grounds on Saturday evening, presented by the Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival. The duo will be supported by legendary jazz drummer Billy Cobham and bassist Guy Nsangue. Subramaniams daughter Seetaa and wife Kavita (Krishnamurthy) will lend their voice to the world music feast, backed by Srei International Finance Ltd. Its a huge honour for us to be able to bring to Calcutta such legends of world music.

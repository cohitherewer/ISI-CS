In a daring incident late on Thursday, the driver of a Sumo was thrown out by five passengers, including a woman and her two children, who later sped off with the vehicle. The carjack took place on the approach road to Howrah near Chapsarah, in the Serampore police station area. The driver said a couple had rented his vehicle to offer puja at Tarakeswar.

The officer-in-charge of the police station said the driver of the rented vehicle, Debendra Dubey, 42, was admitted to Serampore Walsh Hospital in critical condition.

 Monday, April 21, 2003 				 Riot... the saga of Piriti
																								Based on Shashi Tharoors novel, Riot, this play deals with multiple issues and examines some of the core socio-political matters that ignite hatred and catapult into riot. There is an undercurrent of two opposing emotions  love and hatred  running parallel and sometimes merging into each other. At the end of the play, the question that looms low is: Is it a story of hate or is it one of love? The setting of the play is based in the Purulia rural belt and there is extensive use of local dialect and folk music, including dhamsa, maadal, and Chhou dance. The story is about a rural youth, Hamid, a talented Chhou dancer who plays the role of Kartick, the God of War in the Hindu pantheon. His artistic contradictions and his social existence as a Muslim performing the role of a Hindu god, lead to a dramatic confrontation. Meanwhile, Priscilla, an American girl and member of an NGO, lands in Purulia and falls in love with Hamid. This leads to tragic consequences. Arghas latest production is scripted and directed by Manish Mitra. 																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

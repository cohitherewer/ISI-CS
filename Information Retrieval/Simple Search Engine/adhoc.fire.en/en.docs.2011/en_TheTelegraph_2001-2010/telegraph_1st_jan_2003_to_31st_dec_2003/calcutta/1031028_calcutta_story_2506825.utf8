 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 The Ganguram outlet, scene of a dawn dacoity. Part of the loot was a cache of 40 dry-fruit boxes. Picture by Pabitra Das 																								From mobile to mithai  the festive frenzy saw a gang of goons lapping up whatever came its way on bhai phonta eve.																								In the early hours of Monday, the gang raided a Ganguram shop, near the Chowringhee-Shakespeare Sarani crossing. Along with the cash box, containing Rs 15,000, the robbers fled with a feast  around 40 boxes of dry fruits, neatly gift-wrapped for Diwali.																								Priced between Rs 250 and Rs 300, the boxes are in great demand during Diwali as corporate houses gift them to clients and suppliers. They contain cashew nuts, raisins, walnuts, etc, said Sumit Chaurasia, owner of the shop.																								Not far from the sweet-shop swoop and not too long ago, the shutters of a mobile handset showroom at 20H, Park Street, were forced open and 62 imported cellphones, worth no less than Rs 7 lakh, were swiped. Police see a pattern to the shop loots and suspect the hand of the same gang.																								At the mobile phone outlet, the gang broke open the lock and the shutter with an iron rod. The scratch marks on the shutter suggest a skilled hand, said an officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station.																								But while the burglars cleaned out the display counters, they couldnt get into room where a huge stock of cellphones was stashed.																								Both the incidents were reported at Shakespeare Sarani police station on Monday afternoon. Preliminary investigation suggested that one group had conducted the twin operations between 3 am and 4 am on Monday.																								Tracing a pattern to the mobile-and-mithai thefts, police said the goons probably came in a car and after laying their hands on the cellphone booty, drove down to the Chowringhee sweet shop.																								At around 6.30 in the morning, when I came to open the shop, I found that the lower end of the shutter had been twisted out of shape, Chaurasia told Metro, at his Ganguram store.																								The shutter was very strong and I dont know how they managed it without alerting anyone Normally, we dont leave cash in the shop, but since we dont make any payments on Diwali, which was followed by a Sunday, we left some cash here to make the payments on Monday, he added.																								So, the goons got lucky  when it came to the cash  but the dry-fruit boxes, worth more than Rs 10,000, were only to be expected at this time of the year.																								Private guard 																								pitch follows 																								unheard-of 																								mithai theft																								Chaurasia, who says he has nev-																								er heard of a sweet shop in the 																								city being burgled in this man																								ner, is looking at the option of de																								ploying private security at his 																								outlet on one of Calcuttas 																								busiest thoroughfares.																								Calcutta, which can easily 																								lay claim to the title of sweet 																								capital, has not recorded any 																								such organised theft at a mithai 																								shop in recent public memory, 																								police said. While stray cases of 																								shop-lifting have seen sweet																								sellers intensifying vigil at their 																								stores, the Ganguram gang-raid 																								could well spark a trend of pri																								vate security guards at the good 																								ol mishti shop.																								A Tiger patrol van of Calcut																								ta Police is supposed to be doing 																								the rounds of the area to keep a 																								constant vigil in the zone that 																								houses some of the biggest retail 																								outlets and corporate offices in 																								the city.																								And the Ganguram outlet is a 																								cashew nuts throw away from 																								Ho Chi Minh Sarani, that houses 																								both the British deputy high 																								commission and the American 																								consulate, two of the most high-																								security addresses in town.																								 quot;The patrol van is always on 																								the rounds. The gang must have 																								observed the timings of the po																								lice patrol before planning its op																								eration. Otherwise, it could not 																								have been such a smooth exer																								cise, quot; said an officer of the local 																								police station. quot;We are trying to 																								identify the similarities in the 																								modus operandi of the two oper																								ations. This would help us ascer																								tain the involvement of the same 																								group, quot; he added.

  Young human being has the right to live with dignity and that includes a prostitute. To justify rape on a woman because she is a prostitute (Top cop slur on rape victim, Metro, April 4) is reprehensible and condemnatory, more so when it comes from a keeper of the law. Even if we assume that the victim was a prostitute, doesnt she have the right to refuse? How is it that the superintendent of police is a veritable storehouse of knowledge regarding the victims character while he has very little to say about the three arrested men? The way he has maligned the victims character raises a few questions. Did he know the girl? Had he propositioned her and was turned down? Was he the one who sent those men after her in an act of revenge? West Bengal is increasingly becoming unsafe for women. And what with law-enforcing people like this superintendent justifying rape and indulging in character assassination of a woman, the situation does not seem to get any better.Lalita Agarwal,Bagmari the Metro report Kids skip peace rally, barred from class test (April 1), it is horrendous news how 140 students of a school have been disallowed to sit for the examination since they did not join the Left-sponsored rally. This is a glaring example of how education has been politicised. It is also alleged that kids were made to stand on the bench and denied tiffin. Can these teachers be trusted with the sacred job of teaching?Govinda Bakshi,Budge Budge.The report is an example of how political guardians are trying to spread their tentacles even in the primary school arena. The Marxist government has already done a lot of damage to education in the state. Will the next generation forgive them for such crimes?Mohan Lal Sarkar,Budge Budge.This shows us how teachers are injecting the seeds of politics at the root of the education system. Students are getting confused about the primary objectives of their career.Subhasish ruin the child (March 27) reveals an alarming statistic that 40 children out of every 100 suffer from depression. Parents want to see their wards at the top of the table. So children, being unable to tolerate the scolding at home and bear the burden of the school curricula, resort to the suicide path. Our grandparents were not educated like todays parents but they guide their offsprings better.G.  The chakka jam call by the transport minister to protest the war on Iraq was unexpected (Saddam shadow on streets at noon leaves motionless, Metro, March 22). It could not have made a difference to the transport minister who did not have to suffer in the jam. It was the commuters who had to face it all. Sumant of National Library has categorically instructed staff members to stick to their tables to improve the deteriorating services (Job in time whip for library staff, Metro, March 24). The yeoman service rendered by the library suffers a setback if books are not available at the request of readers.Piyal factory swoop (Metro, March 28), it is alarming to learn that the CID found fake injections and drugs in a factory. One wonders how many such rackets operate in the state.Prahlad Agarwala,Nadia.

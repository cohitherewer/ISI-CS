 The death of 22-year-old housewife Shalini Jaiswal sparked  a mob fury on Friday night. Shalini was admitted with burn  injuries to a nursing home in Salt Lake, where she died on  Thursday. Based on the complaint lodged by Shalinis relatives,  the Beniapukur police arrested her husband Shekhar and in-laws  Rajendra Prasad and Uma Devi late on Thursday. On Friday night,  a group of local youth, along with Shalinis relatives from  Beniapukur, took the hearse carrying her body to the north  Calcutta shop of Shekhar. Shouting slogans against the husband  and accusing him of her death, they started ransacking his  shop. The trouble spread to adjacent shops. When local traders  resisted, the group fled the spot, leaving Shalinis body  behind. Later, officials from the Bowbazar police station  retrieved the body. No arrest had been made till late on Friday.  The city police arrested a co-owner of a travel agency from  his Strand Road office on Friday. According to DC, DD, Soumen  Mitra, the arrest was made on the basis of a complaint lodged  by four tourists who were allegedly duped of Rs 75,000. According  to Mitra, Amitabha Mukherjee and three others paid Kalyan  Ghosh, one of the owners of the travel agency, for a trip  to Nepal. They left the city on November 10 and reached Birgunge  the next day. But Ajit Das, the tour manager, went missing  there. So, the four returned and lodged a complaint with the  Burrabazar police station. Police are looking for Ghoshs  brother Manik, another co-owner of the travel agency. The  arrested has been booked on charges of cheating.  Two business groups, one from France and the other from Denmark,  met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Friday and discussed  investment proposals in agro-business and dairy sectors, respectively.  Calcutta High Court on Friday rejected the anticipatory bail  petition filed by Adridharan Das, former president of Iskcon  temple in Calcutta, who was apprehending arrest in connection  with the alleged defalcation of funds. The present president,  Dayaram Das, had lodged the complaint against Adridharan for  defalcation of Iskcon funds.  Jagmohan Dalmiya, owner of M.L. Dalmiya and Company which  is entrusted with the responsibility of building the leather  complex at Bantala, met industry minister Nirupam Sen at his  office on Friday and briefed him about the progress. Later,  Dalmiya told reporters that the minister would visit the complex  on November 25.  A 45-year-old woman, Aleya Biwi, died and 30 others were injured,  as a private bus on route 87 rammed into a roadside tree and  overturned at Santoshpur, on National Highway 34, near Barasat  on Friday morning. Three of the injured are in critical condition.  According to police, the bus was coming from Barrackpore and  headed towards Barasat.

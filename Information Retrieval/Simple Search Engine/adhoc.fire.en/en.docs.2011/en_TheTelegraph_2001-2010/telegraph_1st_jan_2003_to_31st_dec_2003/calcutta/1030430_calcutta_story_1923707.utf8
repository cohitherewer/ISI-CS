 Wednesday, April 30, 2003 				 Murder suspect dead on rail track
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								Biswajit Banik, alias Monta, 24, allegedly involved in the murder of his friend Abhijit Pal on Sunday night, was found dead on the railway tracks near Bidhannagar station on Tuesday. 																								Six teenagers were arrested on Monday in connection with Pals murder. Police said the youths kidnapped Pal and ordered him to call his parents, seeking ransom for his release. When Pal refused to oblige, the youths strangled him and dumped the body on National Highway 34 off Amdanga, in Barasat. Pals father is an artisan in Dakshindari.																								Biswajit, the police say, was connected with the gang that abducted and murdered Pal. He and the driver of the Tata Sumo, in which Pal was abducted, were evading arrest. His body was found in two halves around 8.30 am beside the railway track near Dakshindari. Police suggest it was suicide.																								After netting six members of the gang, we were on the lookout for Biswajit and the driver. We have recovered the Sumo used by the gang, said Basudeb Bag, district police superintendent. He could not shed any light on the reason behind Biswajits death.																								It may be that Biswajit took fright at the news of the arrest of his friends on a charge of murder. It appears to be a case of suicide. But we are investigating to see if he was killed, said the officer-in-charge of Lake Town police station.  Mishap death: A 22-year-old  youth died after a car knocked him down near Netaji Indoor  Stadium on Monday night. The youth, identified as Rabin  Nehari, was filling a bucket at a roadside tap when the  car hit him. He died in SSKM Hospital.

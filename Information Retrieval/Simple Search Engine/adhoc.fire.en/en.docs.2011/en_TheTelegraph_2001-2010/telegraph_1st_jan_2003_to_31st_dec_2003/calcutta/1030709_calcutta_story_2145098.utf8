 Wednesday, July 09, 2003 				 Plumber pointer in murder probe
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mystery shrouds the murder of Gunjan Tanwani, 25, in a Baguiati highrise on Monday. The wife of a local businessman was gagged and slashed to death.																								Police detained two persons on Tuesday for interrogation, but failed to ascertain the motive of the murder. The prime suspect, a plumber, is yet to be traced. The police have recovered some plumbing tools and a blood-stained shirt from the room where Gunjan was found murdered, with her veins slashed and cut marks on her waist. A number of almirahs had been smashed open. 																								Gunjan got married to Ramesh three years ago. The Tanwanis hailed from Katihar in Bihar, but three months ago, Dwarkadas bought the Baguiati flat and shifted there with wife Kanta, son Ramesh and daughter-in-law Gunjan. The father-son duo runs a motor-parts shop on VIP Road.																								Every morning, around 8 am, Dwarkadas and Ramesh would leave home and head for their shop. Monday was no different, except for the fact that Gunjan was left alone as mother-in-law Kanta was away in Hyderabad, visiting relatives. 																								According to Raj Kumar, a relative of Gunjan, the assault on her was carried out anytime between 10.30 am and 8 pm, when her husband returned home.																								According to Supriyo Das, officer-in-charge of Baguiati police station, one of the maids told the cops that she had seen a man entering the flat with a small bag in hand sometime before noon. Around noon, when she went to the Tanwani home, she found the door shut and rang the bell repeatedly. But no one responded and she left.																								At 8 pm, Ramesh returned from work and started knocking on the door when Gunjan did not come to open it. Ramesh repeatedly called her cellphone and when even that drew no response, he asked the securitymen of the complex to break down the door.																								On entering the flat, Ramesh found Gunjan lying dead in a pool of blood. There were several slash marks on her waist  which police later said had been caused by a screwdriver. The veins on her right wrist had also been cut with a sharp weapon. Her mouth was taped to prevent her from shouting for help, said Das, adding that there was evidence of Gunjan struggling till the end.																								A number of tools found at the spot have led the police to suspect that the murderer could be a plumber known to the family. The murderer had ransacked the rooms and broken open a number of almirahs but till late on Tuesday, Ramesh and his father could not confirm whether anything apart from Gunjans cellphone had been stolen.

 Friday, July 04, 2003 				 Hefty hike in five-year tax on cars
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The state government has framed a new tax structure for private cars, for paying one-time tax for five years. A Bill in this regard was passed in the state Assembly on Wednesday. 																								Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said the yearly tax for private cars was increased in January 2003, but the five-year tax remained unchanged. Under the new structure, a fresh levy of Rs 6,120 has been imposed on vehicles weighing up to 500 kg, against the present rate of Rs 1,620.																								Cars between 500 and 800 kg in weight will see a hike from Rs 2,430 to Rs 6,930. For vehicles between 800 and 1,000 kg, the existing tax of Rs 2,835 has shot up to Rs 7,335. For those between 1,000 and 1,200 kg, the new rate has been fixed at Rs 7,740, against the present rate of Rs 3,240. Owners of cars between 1,200 and 2,000 kg will have to shell out Rs 12,600, against the existing Rs 8,100; while the levy for vehicles between 2,000 and 3,000 kg has climbed up from Rs 12,150 to Rs 16,650.																								The Bill is awaiting the approval of governor Viren J. Shah.

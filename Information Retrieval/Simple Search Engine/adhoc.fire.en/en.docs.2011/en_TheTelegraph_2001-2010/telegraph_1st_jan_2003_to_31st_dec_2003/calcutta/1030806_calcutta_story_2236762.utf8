The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 06, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Quit spitting, or clean up
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Can a water-and-bucket penalty, a la Metro, be imposed for spitting in public places? A clean picture: Will the civic authorities take the  Metro penalty route?  Michelle Mendes,
																		Marquis Lane.																																																														Yes, I think imposing a water-and-bucket penalty in the manner of the rule imposed by Metro Railways is a welcome move. People have become used to spitting in public and getting away with the act. But when they are actually caught in the act and are penalised for it, they will think twice! Fear of a penalty will do what moral lessons cannot. I believe this will lead to a better and cleaner Calcutta. Aklank Jain,
																		Howrah.																																																														Merely imposing this policy legally will not do. There must be a separate agency for its implementation. Its members must take an oath to work in tandem for executing this policy to perfection. Adarsh Barjatya,
																		Howrah.																																																														It is an excellent idea to impose a penalty on people creating an unhygienic environment. If the public becomes aware and provide full support to this idea, then the day will not be too far when our country will be clean and green.									

Chandan Ray,
																		Sarsuna.																																																														The success of a water-and-bucket penalty in line with what has been imposed on the Metro premises is a remote possibility on the roads since pedestrians have all the liberty of either spitting or dirtying the roads and no one is there to lodge any complaint, be it municipal personnel engaged to clean the roads or fellow pedestrians. One reason why no one bothers is because a warning may take an ugly turn and end in insult and injury for the person raising objections. What is lacking in our city is civic sense. Unless strict vigil and penalty is imposed, the situation would spell doomsday for civilians with the spread of diseases. 									

Avishek Ganguly,
																		Bally.																																																														The water-and-bucket penalty is not tough enough to tackle the problem of spitting in public places. There are many people who lack a sense of shame and even if they are made to pay the penalty, they will continue their coarse act of spitting publicly. Moreover, the water-and-bucket penalty is insufficient to arouse public consciousness because it cannot be implemented on a large scale. Imposition of stringent fines on the guilty is the best remedy for the problem. 									

Kashif Iftekhar, 
																		Howrah.																																																														People here move with an attitude. They have no time to look for spittoons and finally commit nuisance wherever they please. So, this is a right move to teach them a lesson. But how will the offenders be identified? Is it possible to post an observer everywhere? If this idea can be implemented on the Metro premises, then it can also be done in some other public places, especially in hospitals where maintaining hygiene is a necessity.									

Amitava Mukherjee,
																		Barrackpore. 																																																														Yes. A penalty should be imposed for spitting in public places. Keeping the city clean must be the citizens responsibility. But sometimes we forget it. As a result, public places get exposed to risk of diseases. So, it would be a great move if there are penalties imposed on spitters. But one thing should be ensured before starting this penalty rule. It wouldnt be an easy job of executing the rule if the municipality does not clean up its act.									

Usha Dwarkani, 
																		Rabindra Nagar. 																																																														Spitting in public place makes our city dirty. A water-and-bucket penalty, a la Metro Rail, may be imposed for spitting in public places. This is a very good idea. A fixed amount should also be fined.									

Bhupen Bose. 
																		Dum Dum.																																																														Many thanks to Metro Railway authorities for taking the bold step against people spitting gutkha or paan masala. A person dirtying the Metro stations is being suitably fined or made to wash the station these days. The success of the drive should encourage the civic authorities to impose the same penalty for the rest of the city as well. There should not be any compromise with culprits who give the city a bad name.									

Kanai Saha,
																		Gauri Bari Lane.																																																														Most citzens have no civic sense. They are reckless about spitting in public places and creating a nuisance. Such bad practices should be prevented either by imposing a heavy fine or detaining the offenders behind bars. The penalty evolved by the Metro Rail authorities, which appears to be very effective, may also be introduced.									

Govinda Bakshi
																		Budge Budge.																																																														Cleanliness is next to godliness goes the adage. Naturally, spitting in any public places is definitely a nuisance, not to speak of Metro Rail, the glory of Calcutta. Moreover, spit carries germs detrimental to public health. So, the governments imposition of penalty for spitting in public places is a welcome measure. T.R. Anand,
																		Budge Budge.																																																														The move has not only helped Metro authorities in keeping the station clean but will also put the leash on indisciplined passengers who would fear such a disgraceful penalty. If the authorities want to be a little lenient, they can let go with a spot fine of Rs 500. This would be more acceptable. It is high time that civic authorities start caring more for discipline and cleanliness or else the city would soon become a garbage dump.									

Chhaya Das,
																		K.K. Majumder Road.																																																														The penalty will not be of much help, even in the Metro, if the authorities do not keep a strict watch on commuters. More close-circuit televisions must be installed through the entire length of the platforms. Besides, the penalty should be extended to the compartments, too, as children often toss chocolate wrappers on the floor, while their parents look on.									

Urmi Sengupta,
																		Santoshpur.																																																														Hopefully, the water-and-bucket move will check littering on the Metro premises. The move is more effective than slapping a cash fine, as people are quite embarrassed of mopping the platform in full public glare. The fear factor is likely to be the trump card in this case. Debyani Basu,
																		Birati.																																																														Thanks to Metro for undertaking the clean-up drive underground. They should not even supply the bucket of water so that the offenders have to wipe the spit with their own handkerchieves. This measure should be introduced across the entire city to free its walls from betel stains.

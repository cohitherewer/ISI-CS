 Wednesday, October 22, 2003 				 For Buddha, a tale of terrible negligence
 															- I HAVE TO PUNISH SOME PEOPLE, PLEDGES CM OUR BUREAU				 	 Susmita Biswas parents, Samir and Kajol, and brother Souvik are led into the office of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Tuesday morning. They spent about an hour at Writers Buildings, recounting to Bhattacharjee the sequence of events that led to her death at SSKM Hospital on Friday. Picture by Pabitra Das																								A preliminary report and an hour spent with the family of Susmita Biswas on Tuesday convinced chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that the 20-year-old had been a victim of terrible negligence at SSKM Hospital last Friday.																								I have to punish some people, Bhattacharjee told reporters at Writers Buildings, moments after meeting Susmitas parents and brother.																								Susmita, a student of East Calcutta Girls College, had been rushed from her Baguiati residence to SSKM at 7.30 am on October 17, with a blood disorder and breathing trouble. She lay unattended for more than nine hours, her parents alleged. The doctors finally decided to shift her to the new emergency ward, but the trolley had no wheels. So she had to be taken in a taxi to the ward, for which the oxygen mask was taken off. This proved fatal.																								Bhattacharjee met Susmitas father Samir, mother Kajol and brother Souvik in his office around noon, to hear every detail of the tragedy at one of the governments premier hospitals. The chief minister, apparently, stopped Samir Biswas midway and told him that the preliminary report he had received from the health department said Susmitas father was not present at the hospital between 1.40 pm and 5 pm that day.																								Samir Biswas then produced a prescription, where a hospital official had stated, at 4.15 pm, that no bed was available. The chief minister was shocked and asked an official to have it photo-copied immediately, said a member of his secretariat.																								The chief minister then asked Samir Biswas for a detailed account of what had happened at SSKM that day. Susmitas father explained how the doctor-in-charge of the emergency ward had given the admission papers to a trolley boy and ordered him to shift the patient.																								After taking the papers from the doctor, the trolley boy disappeared for about 10 minutes. When he reappeared, he could not find a trolley. Then he managed to find one but it did not have wheels. When my daughter was being shifted, the trolley boy whipped off the oxygen mask...																								As the distraught father struggled to find words, Bhattacharjee reportedly told him: Samirbabu, I dont believe this can happen in a civilised society. I will not be able to bring your daughter back but I will take stern action against those responsible for the death.																								The chief minister, according to his secretariat, gave young Souvik his office number and urged him to contact him whenever they faced any problem.																								Outside, a stern security cordon prevented journalists from getting anywhere close to Susmitas parents while they were being escorted in and out of Writers. Some photographers suffered injuries in the melee.																								After Susmitas parents left his office, the chief minister said punitive action would be taken against those guilty of the terrible negligence after the return of state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, in a day or two.																								Director of medical education C.R. Maity and director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee are conducting the probe into Susmitas death. The report will be submitted to health secretary Asim Barman on Wednesday.																								Immediate action would be taken by the health department, pledged Barman. The government will not spare anyone found guilty  and that includes everyone, from the man at the top to the staff at the lowest level, he added.

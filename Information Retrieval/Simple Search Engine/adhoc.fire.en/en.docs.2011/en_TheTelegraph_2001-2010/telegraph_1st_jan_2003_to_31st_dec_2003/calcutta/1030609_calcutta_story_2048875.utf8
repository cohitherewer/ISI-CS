The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, June 09, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	The Salkia Chowrasta is always cluttered with buses, bicycles,  rickshaws and other vehicles. Nobody follows any road rules  and the traffic police look helpless. In the evening, trucks  and other vehicles are garaged along G.T. Road almost up  to 2 km and it takes more than an hour to cross the stretch.  The cops need to activate themselves.  
	B.L. Chandak, Salkia.  
	The city is in the grip of a water crisis. The water-level  has dipped alarmingly in several areas. The civic authorities  must ensure that roadside taps are fitted with faucets and  are not left open round-the-clock.  
	S. Ram, 50, School Road.

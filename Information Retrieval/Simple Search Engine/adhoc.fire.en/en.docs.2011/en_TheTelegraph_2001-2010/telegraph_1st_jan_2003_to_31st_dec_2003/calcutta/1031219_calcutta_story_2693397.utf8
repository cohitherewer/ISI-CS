	The AJC Bose Road flyover may have been completed but a  lot remains to be done below it. While cars, taxis and two-wheelers  have the privilege to drive over the flyover, the common  mans woes have not been lessened. The government should  speed up work and also allow buses and minibuses to ply  over the flyover. The authorities must think of the hapless  commuters who need to reach Park Circus, Beckbagan and Ballygunge. 
	 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.  
	Recently, I had to run from pillar to post for a tube of  gum at the General Post Office. I needed to affix a stamp  on a letter. On inquiry, I came to know that the GPO has  stopped providing gum. But would it not be an immense help  to customers if they did? 
	 S. Sivaraman, Dover Road.  
	The garbage vat placed near the Budge Budge municipality  is a bother. It should be shifted.  
	Mohan Lal Sarkar, Budge Budge.

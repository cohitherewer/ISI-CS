																																																		Fourteen children were taken ill on Saturday night at Bharatmata Colony, in the Dasnagar police station area of Howrah, when they consumed insecticide by mistake. Police said one of the boys found a bottle of oil on the banks of a nearby pond. He took the bottle home and enjoyed a meal, along with 13 of his friends, cooked in the same oil. Soon after, the children started vomiting and the situation turned so grave that they had to be rushed to Howrah State General Hospital. The doctors on the case found that the oil was an insecticide to kill mosquitoes. According to hospital sources, five of the 14 children have been released on Sunday morning, but others are still under observation. They are, however, reported to be out of danger.

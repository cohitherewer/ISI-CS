																																																		A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Wednesday set aside a trial court order restraining the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) from assessing the valuation of a building only on the owners version. With the stay order, the CMC will be at liberty to assess the valuation of any city building, without allowing the occupiers to plead their case. Purnima Bagaria, of Park Street, had moved Calcutta High Court, alleging that the citys civic authority had declined to give her a hearing while assessing the valuation of the building in which she is one of the tenants. The petitioners counsel argued that the civic authorities had no right to assess the valuation without hearing out the tenants. Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharjee of Calcutta High Court, after hearing the petitioner as well as the CMC, passed an order restraining the civic authorities from assessing the valuation of the building without giving a hearing to the petitioner. The CMC challenged the order of Justice Bhattacharjee in the division bench of Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice A. Banerjee. CMC counsel Ashok Das Adhikari told the court that it was not binding upon on his client to call the tenants while determining the value of any building. He said that sometimes, the owners egg on the occupants to file cases, seeking only to delay the process so that the tax of a building cannot be evaluated on time. The division bench passed an interim order, staying the order of Justice Bhattacharjee, and admitted the case for hearing.

According to sources, Asadul had planned the robbery in which an employee of a dairy farm was robbed of Rs 7 lakh on his way from Barasat with the companys money. Two of his associates were arrested a few days ago and during interrogation, they confessed that the robbery was Asaduls brainchild.

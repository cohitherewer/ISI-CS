 Friday, August 15, 2003 				 High court orders forged
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								The high court has unearthed a racket in fake court documents, including forged orders and official seals. On the basis of a complaint by the registrar-general of the court, a criminal case has been initiated against a lawyer, who allegedly issued forged orders of two judges, on the basis of which his clients were allowed to appear for an examination. According to police, investigation is on to find the others involved in the racket.																								The investigation by the registrar-general was started after he received a letter from the block development officer (BDO) of Mamudpur, in Burdwan, listing the names of at least five persons of the area whom he allowed to take a written test on the basis of high court orders.																								According to the BDO, the written examination was held to select candidates for the post of panchayat sahayak. Five persons found non-eligible for the test submitted five separate orders, signed by Justice Amitava Lala and Justice Dilip Seth of the high court, asking the authorities to allow them to take the test. Two of the five were later selected and allowed to join the posts in September 2002. But, recently, an allegation has been made by one Hanif Sheikh of the area, that the high court orders were forged, the BDO said.																								The registrar found that the orders were fake and the judges signatures had been forged. He also found that the offenders had issued a duplicate seal of the courts assistant registrar. A criminal case was lodged against lawyer Hussain Ali, who had sent the order to Burdwan. Ali is absconding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, August 01, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Arun Lal, cricketer.  You always stand out in a crowd and seldom lose sight  of your goals. People admire your individuality and independence.  During a crisis, you are a pillar of support for family  and friends. You never plunge into a project without grasping  it fully.   Kusum Bhandari

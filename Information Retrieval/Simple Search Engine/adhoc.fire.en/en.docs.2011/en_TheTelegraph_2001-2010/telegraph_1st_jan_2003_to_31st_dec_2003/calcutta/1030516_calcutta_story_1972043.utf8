The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, May 16, 2003 				 Untitled
The initial idea for this production was sparked off by the treatment of women by the Talibans  a mirror of the plight of dominated women in hopelessly doomed world, where man makes himself the ubiquitous master. From that was born this production, based on Dario Fos Medea and directed by Arvind Gaur. Medea is one of the most horrific and powerful Greek tragedies, a play of dark revenge and slaughter dominated by the towering figure of Medea. Untitled swings between two scenarios to raise pertinent questions relating to the position of women. The entire play is enacted solo by Lushin Dubey, one of the most talented and versatile Delhi-based actresses. She is rivetting as she emotes, makes use of puppetry and portrays many roles, using masks, gait, speech and props  brilliantly  to delve deep into the characters psyche. Theatre is all about life around us, the passion and the fervour, real feelings and experiences in a made-to-order setting. And that is what characterises this playlet in Hindi (mostly) and English. Hosted jointly by Open Doors and Godrej Pentacool to celebrate Helpage Indias silver jubilee.																								When amp; Where: Today at Hyatt Regency Ballroom, 8 pm; Tomorrow at Tollygunge Club (HSBC Ballroom, 7.30 pm

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, July 05, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Dipankar De, actor. You  are calm, even in adversity. You add an exciting touch to  the dullest of things. Though you can be adventurous and  unpredictable, your easy nature and sensitivity make others  comfortable. You are on a constant quest for knowledge.   Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, August 23, 2003 				 Rhythmic exposition
Calcuttans are all too familiar with the legacy of Uday Shankar-Amala Shankar. Their only son Ananda Shankar and his wife Tanusree carved out a niche for themselves in the sphere of performing arts by sheer hard work and determination, coupled with loads of talent. The duo set up the Ananda Shankar Centre for Performing Arts to nurture and promote young talents. After the demise of Ananda Shankar, Tanusree took up the mantle and now, after years of hard work, she can sit back and rest on her laurels. The organisation imparts creative dance lessons to enthusiasts and launches new productions from time to time. The centre also showcases the works of its pupils in the annual demonstration show. This years show is divided into two halves. In the first half, over 300 students of the centre from the Preparatory class to the Advanced level, will present a kaleidoscope of dance, colour and rhythm. The second half features a ballet Mrignayani, based on a historical episode. It portrays the extraordinary union of the legendary King Man Singh with Mrignayani, a peasant girl with astonishing courage and valour.

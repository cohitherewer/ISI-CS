 Tuesday, August 12, 2003 				 Chase-and-stab on Chowringhee
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The chase was short but deadly  from Tata Centre till Jeevan Deep. On Sunday night, a bleeding youth, in his early twenties, sped along the 50-metre stretch to save himself from the daggers of his assailants. But the run was futile. He was caught and stabbed to death.																								During a routine patrol at midnight, officials of Shakespeare Sarani police station noticed the youth lying on the pavement of Middleton Street. They rushed him to SSKM Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The victim was later identified as Ramesh Maru, 23, a resident of Goenka Street, in Burrabazar. 																								During preliminary investigation, police came to know that Ramesh was an employee of a jewellery shop at Metro Plaza. He was on his way home after work. The murder had been chalked out earlier and the killers must have known his timings, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner (I) of the detective department. Ramesh was stabbed four times, which proves the attack was deliberate, he added.																								The attack occurred close to 10 pm. A trail of blood lay from the entry gate of Tata Centre till the pavement of Middleton Street, where we recovered the body, police said. We believe first blood was drawn in front of Tata Centre, said an official of the detective departments homicide wing. After examining the wounds, the sleuths said Ramesh was first stabbed from behind. He was chased down JL Nehru Road till the Middleton Street crossing, said an official investigating the case.																								A spot-investigation located two persons of the area who witnessed the chase. According to their statement, the pavement was not well-lit but they saw three persons pounce on a man. The victim first slumped on the pavement, but soon managed to get up and start running. The attackers followed him, daggers drawn. The victim stumbled and fell on the road, and the assailants stabbed him again. He was screaming, but no one dared to resist his killers, one of the witnesses told the sleuths.																								Ramesh managed to turn into Middleton Street but he slipped and fell on the pavement. By then, two of the assailants pinned him down while the third stabbed him twice. Then, the trio walked away, said one of the investigating officers.																								Police, however, are still in the dark about the motive. We have talked to Rameshs parents and family. Nothing fruitful has emerged. We are questioning his employer and colleagues, too, said deputy commissioner Mitra. The detectives are also trying to ferret out any links the victim may have developed with the citys crime circuit.

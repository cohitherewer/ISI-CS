				 																																									Several  roadside eateries have mushroomed in and around Kailash Bose  Street, in north Calcutta, over the past few months. Most  of these are makeshift stalls and if the encroachment is not  checked right now, the authorities will find it very difficult  to remove them later. 
 Tathagata Kar, 
 Kailash Bose Street. 				 																																									A  few unauthorised factory units situated on Bright Street are  inconveniencing the local residents. Higher Secondary candidates  have to bear with the constant disturbance. We have complained  to the Karaya police station, but no action has been taken  till date.

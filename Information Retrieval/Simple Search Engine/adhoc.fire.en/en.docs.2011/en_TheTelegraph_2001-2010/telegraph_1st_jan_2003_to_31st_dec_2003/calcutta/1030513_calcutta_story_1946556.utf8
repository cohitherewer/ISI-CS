The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, May 13, 2003 				 Conflict cause over books
 Iraqi children sit near a British Challenger tank in  Basra, southern Iraq (Reuters)  How unconnected can the classroom  be from world conflict? With the battle for Baghdad won  and lost, Time to Talk asked its readers whether  the promised land (the campuses of America and England)  would be a lesser draw this year. In the wake of the war,  will students think twice about going to universities in  the US and the UK? Yes, no, maybe... More responses will  be printed next week Most of the students go to the  US because they are attracted by the better and higher standard  of living there. So, I dont think that the Iraq war will  reduce the desire of the youth to pursue higher education  in the US or the UK as this conflict it is not likely to  have an adverse effect on the standard of living there.				 				 																															Manan Agarwal, Ist yr, St Xaviers College Students will definitely think  twice before setting out to study in the US and the UK,  because they dont want to risk their lives at the altar  of higher studies. Also, why go abroad when there are so  many colleges and new institutes coming up in India these  days?				 				 																															Zainab R. Vithorawala Blood has been shed in 1991 and  again blood is going to be shed in 2003. The Bush and Blair  partnership is responsible for the slaughter in Iraq. The  motivation behind this is total control over the oilfields.  They have defied the UN and gone against world opinion.  Their own people are against them and now in the wake of  the war students should boycott universities and colleges  as a symbol of protest.				 				 																															Sananda Sen,				 				 																															Asutosh College Students who wish to go to universities  in the US and the UK have a lot of dreams and high hopes.  Their excitement in seeking knowledge cannot be mellowed  by the influence of wars. Moreover, education and politics  are two different fields that should not be mixed. So, I  dont find enough reasons to think twice about going there.				 				 																															Swati Agrawal,				 				 																															Class XII, Shri Shikshayatan  War decimates everything, from  economy to the dreams of entire nations. Most youngsters  prefer to go abroad, especially to the US, for higher studies.  But today, several restrictions have been imposed on entry  into the US and the UK and students should think twice before  going.				 				 																															Gunjeet S. Wadhwa,				 				 																															Rai Bahadur Road I would definitely think twice  before going there to study because for me being a human  being is much more important than being a student. An opportunity  to study in the UK or the US comes once in a lifetime and  a hell of a lot of hard work and luck goes into it. But  we must not forget that these are the countries responsible  for turning a deaf ear to the pleas of peace from all over  the world and killing thousands of innocent people for a  selfish cause. I know I cant do much about the present  situation and lessen the sufferings of the Iraqi people,  but if I take this decision, then deep in my heart I will  know that I have done the right thing.				 				 																															Saadia Sitwat,				 				 																															Ist Yr, B.Sc Well, there are some risks, of  course. The US and the UK have the best universities but  they are also waging war against another country. Education  is affected by war. In the wake of the war, anything can  happen. Therefore, I feel students should think twice about  going to study in the US and the UK.				 				 																															Rashi Daga,				 				 																															Class X, Modern High (Top) Shreya Ghoshal.  (Above) A scene from her greatest hit Dola Re, picturised  on Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai, in Devdas				 				 																															Winning notes				 				 																															I have written my exam well today. I think with this encouragement, kal bhi main achchhi likhoongi. The thanksgiving speech struck a chord in the filmi gathering at the Hotel Tulip auditorium in Mumbai. But then, the petite figure collecting the award on stage was a day from her 19th birthday. Shreya Ghoshal, the latest sensation in the playback corridors of Bollywood, is the youngest even among todays early starters. And started she has with many a bang  Zee Cine awards, Filmfare, Sansui Viewers Choice, Stardust Quite a collection in the nine months since Dola Re in Devdas.				 				 																															I keep those awards in a not-so-visible corner of my room so that I dont become complacent, says the voice of Aishwarya Rai (Paro). Her songs for Bipasha Basu in Jism, too, have hit the top 10 charts. Yet, Paro remains special. It must have been the innocence in my voice that made Sanjayji (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) pick me, reflects the winner of the TVS Sa Re Ga Ma contest, on her dream break. It is now part of music lore how the director was watching the TV show where 14-year-old Shreya outsang senior competitors. The Devdas call came in March 2000. Sanjayji had kept me in mind for a year-and-a-half, says the student of South Indian Education Society (SIES) College, Mumbai, the surprise still evident in her now-famous voice.				 				 																															Class is a still where a major part of Shreyas day is spent (Education is important, mother Sharmishtha cuts in). But after college hours (7 am to 12 noon), its off to the recording studios, while the later hours of the day are meant for music practice. Shreya takes classical music lessons from Mukta Bhide. I am also learning Urdu to improve my pronunciation, she says, though Hindi diction for the girl brought up in Rajasthan is not a problem.				 				 																															Does that leave any time for herself? I am a night bird. So, however late I am, I still find time to surf channels. Top favourite is Cartoon Network, but if there is any channel playing her own songs, she has to watch it all. I put the volume up so everyone can hear the song, all over again, she says, excitedly, so what if it disturbs brother Rivus sleep. Being a student celebrity sometimes renders her schedule really hectic. Last year, I had committed to a Durga Puja programme in Pune which coincided with my first-term exams. That meant singing in the evening, travelling back through the night, reaching Mumbai at 3 am and sitting for the exam at 6 am. Dont ask me what I wrote. I wasnt sure myself, she laughs, jumping about from bed to chair and back in her hotel room.				 				 																															Shreya has lots of Bollywood on her plate right now  Main Hoon Na, Zaroorat, Aitbaar, Armaan, Saaya, Imtehaan But not having enough offers from Tollywood surprises her. I have sung in five Bengali films so far, but there should have been more offers, feels the teenaged songstress, who is also busy down south. I am singing for all the masters there, from Illayaraja to M.M. Kreem to A.R. Rahman.				 				 																															Any talk of nervousness is shrugged off. Even Lataji started early. Since I am at the height of enthusiasm, this is the best time to take off. After all, Ill have that many years left to experiment.

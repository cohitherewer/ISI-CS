 Friday, January 24, 2003 				 Mystery woman in college girl murder
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Forty-eight hours after the murder of Papia Sarkar, a student of economics in Thakurpukurs Vivekananda College, the police are yet to make any major breakthrough, and no arrests have been made till Thursday evening.																								The police say that a woman may also be involved in the crime, as a local youth said he had seen Papia on the evening that she disappeared, in the company of a woman. That was the last that anyone  other than the killers  had seen Papia alive.																								The police, of course, have claimed that they are on the verge of arresting the main suspects in the case. They now suspect that besides the two young men, one woman closely known to Papia was involved in the case. 																								Papia, a second-year economics honours student of Vivekananda College, in Thakurpukur, was found brutally murdered in a field in Usthi on Tuesday morning.																								She used to travel to the Thakurpukur college almost every day to attend classes. After college gave over, Papia used to attend coaching classes.																								Every morning, she started from her house around 8 am and returned home close to 8 pm. But on Monday night, when she did not return home, her parents and neighbours raised an alarm and searched everywhere, but could not trace her. Eventually, Papias body was found in a field, with her throat slit.																								After opening an inquiry into the gruesome murder case, the police chanced upon the names of two youths, both apparently in love with Papia. But both the young men have been absconding since the incident.																								Mehmood Akhtar, sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) of Diamond Harbour, said on Thursday that they have sent police teams to different places, including Thakurpukur and Behala. 																								They have also spoken to classmates of Papia to obtain details of the boy with whom she had an affair, and have got some vital clues. They have also interrogated a number of local people to get more information about the boy and the woman who were seen on that day.																								We have already interrogated a number of people, including the family members of Papia, and in all probability, we will arrest the culprits soon, the SDPO said.																								He added that the police were examining a number of articles found in the possession of the girl, which included her personal diary and love letters written by the two youths. All these clues have enabled the police to get close to cracking the murder case, according to investigating officers, who claim they are on the right track.																								We are also waiting for the post-mortem report, because only then will we know whether she was raped by the killers before being murdered, he said.																								Of course, the eyewitness said that the woman left the place before the murder. But even then, there must have been more than one person involved, because the way in which Papia was killed, it could not be the handiwork of a single person, the SDPO said. 																								In the meantime, a family member of Papia alleged that the police are delaying proceedings, as the suspected murderers belong to influential families of the area.																								If the suspected killers are from local areas, then why could they not arrest them even two days after the incident? he asked.

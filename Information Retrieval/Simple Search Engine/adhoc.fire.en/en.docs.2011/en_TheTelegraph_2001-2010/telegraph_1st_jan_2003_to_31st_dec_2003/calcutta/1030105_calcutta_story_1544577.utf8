 A STAFF REPORTER																								Several long-distance trains, which were stranded in different parts of Bihar following a dawn-to-dusk bandh, started rolling towards their destinations on Saturday. 																								Eastern Railway officials said some trains had to be cancelled and rescheduled after their corresponding Down trains arrived late. Delayed arrival of trains and lack of rakes prompted the cancellation of Purba Express, Purbanchal Express and Toofan Express during the day. However, officials expect the situation to be normal by Sunday.																								In the Howrah division, Rajdhani Express reached Howrah 15 hours behind schedule. Saraighat Express, Purba Express and Toofan Express were late by six hours. Sealdah-Delhi Rajdhani Express, slated to reach Sealdah at 10.35 am, pulled in at 1.40 pm instead. Darjeeling Mail arrived in Sealdah three hours behind schedule. Sealdah-Jammu Tawi Express, supposed to arrive at 3.50 pm on Friday, trailed in at 11.50 am on Saturday. Kanchanjungha Express, too, was delayed by about 10 hours.																								Kamrup Express left Howrah at 10.30 pm, instead of at 5.35 pm. Jammu-Tawai Express was rescheduled from 11.45 am to 7.30 pm. The other long-distance trains left Howrah and Sealdah as per schedule, sources said.

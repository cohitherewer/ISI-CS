 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Killer not local man, say cops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The killer of Gunjan Tanwani was not a resident of Baguiati or its adjacent areas. Rather, he came from an adjoining district. Six days after the murder, officials of Baguiati police station made this revelation on Monday.																								Sleuths probing the murder of the 25-year-old wife of a businessman in a Baguiati highrise say Gunjan knew the killer. She was attacked suddenly  probably during a conversation  with a sharp weapon, stabbed thrice and then strangled. Gunjan was gagged and slashed to death in her flat on July 7 between 7 pm and 9 pm. Police recovered her body lying in front of the toilet. A blood-stained shirt and a chappal were found in the room. 																								The local police station, who claimed more success than the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which is conducting a parallel probe, has the names of two other persons believed to be involved in the killing. Though the killer acted alone, the murder was planned by three persons, including him, said an official of Baguiati police station. We hope to make a breakthrough in the next 48 hours, he added.																								These facts have come to light after a scan of the call statement of Gunjans cellphone, which is missing since her murder. The names of the three suspects cant be disclosed for the sake of investigation. But we know that the person who entered the flat that evening and murdered Gunjan is from a well-to-do family, said one of the investigators.																								Police believe that there is a woman involved, too. The day after the murder, during preliminary investigations, they called Gunjans cell number. The call was received by a woman. We dialled the number from Gunjans flat and asked for her. The woman at the other end disconnected the line. We redialled the number several times, and each call was disconnected. Now, the cellphone is switched off, said the cops.																								The motive, however, remains hazy. The killer had no intention of burgling the flat, said a CID sleuth. We are not ruling out the familys business rivalry, he added.

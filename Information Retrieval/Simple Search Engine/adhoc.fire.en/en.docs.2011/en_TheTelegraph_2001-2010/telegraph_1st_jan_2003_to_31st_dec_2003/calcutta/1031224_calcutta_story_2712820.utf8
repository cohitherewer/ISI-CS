																																																		Howrah town reeled under acute drinking water scarcity from Monday afternoon for the second time this year, following a major leak in the pipeline of its Padmapukur pumping station. According to Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) officials, the pipeline had become too rust and a portion needed to be replaced. Work has begun and we hope to resume supply by tomorrow, said HMC mayor Gopal Mukherjee. Residents of Howrah town, particularly in wards 11, 26, 27, 28, 34, 36, 45 and 50, blamed the water scarcity on the civic bodys lackadaisical approach towards maintenance. They complained that after the Padmapukur water works was inaugurated in 1984, the civic authorities promised a steady supply of 40 million gallons of water daily but, in reality, the water works can supply only 2.2 to 2.5 million gallons of water. In February this year, residents of Howrah town had suffered when the pipeline had sprung a similar leak. At that time, the scarcity had continued for over 10 days and several residents contracted diarrhoea after drinking contaminated water. 																																																		Justice Alok Basu of Calcutta High Court on Tuesday rejected a city restaurants prayer for an order restraining the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) from continuing the proceedings against it for allegedly using adulterated ground nut oil for cooking.

After conducting the test, the oil was found unfit for consumption, the lawyer said.

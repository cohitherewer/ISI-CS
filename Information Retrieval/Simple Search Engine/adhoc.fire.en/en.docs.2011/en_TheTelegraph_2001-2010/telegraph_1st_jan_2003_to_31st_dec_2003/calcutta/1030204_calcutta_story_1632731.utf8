																								The city has a quaint charm of its own. It is a city of dichotomies where opposites co-exist harmoniously. However, most Calcuttans are immune to this inherent beauty. Ananda Das, born and brought up in the city, is a promising young artist with a discerning eye. He has witnessed the plight of rickshaw pullers  an inseparable part of the citys milieu for the past two centuries. However, modern modes of transport have pushed the rickshaw pullers existence to the periphery of society. Yet, despite their diminishing tribe, these sons of the soil exist, pulling their hand-drawn carts through the arterial lanes and bye-lanes of the city, defying all obstacles. they go on. Das portrays these rickshaw pullers not as mules carrying burdens but as warriors standing tall in the battle field  their long, muscular hands gripping the cart handles with steely determination as they battle for survival. 																								When: Till February 28; 10 am - 6 pm (Saturdays: 10 am - 3 pm)																								Where: ING Vysya Bank Limited, Sikkim House, 4/1 Middleton Street

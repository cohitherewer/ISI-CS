 SANJAY MANDAL 																								Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government appears to have agreed in principle to allow Salt Lakes house-owners to add floors within the existing framework of rules after paying extra charges for such constructions. 																								We have formed a committee to review the building rules of Salt Lake. The committee has already submitted its preliminary report and we are examining it, keeping in mind the ground realities, said state urban development (UD) minister Asok Bhattacharya on Monday.																								Rigid rules bar Salt Lake plot-owners from constructing more than the stipulated number of floors. Even the Salt Lake civic authorities have written to the government, stressing that the cap on additional floors should be removed in the light of economic realities and the civic authorities need to generate more revenue for the development of the township.																								We have written to the government, urging it to allow construction of additional floors on buildings, said Bidhannagar Municipality chairman Dilip Gupta. The issue will be discussed at our board meeting very soon, he added.																								Municipality officials said they were flooded with demands from residents to relax the building rules and allow them to construct additional floors. However, the relaxation will not come without a rider. The municipality, in its proposal to the UD minister, will include a provision for charging an additional levy. 																								According to our survey, even one additional floor will mean a 15 to 20 per cent population increase in that house. This will mean a rise in the demand for water and in the cost of maintenance of drainage, sewer and other civic amenities, the municipality chairman said. 																								The civic board proposes to charge an additional levy on all plot-owners who add a floor or even a part of it.																								The current rules allow construction of two-storeyed buildings on two to three cottahs, three-storeyed constructions on four cottahs and four storeys on six cottahs. In the case of commercial plots, construction of even 10-storeyed buildings is allowed, provided that adequate space is left in accordance with fire services rules. 																								Explaining the reason for the delay, Salt Lake civic officials said they were thoroughly examining the nature of the demands to prevent owners from letting out their buildings.

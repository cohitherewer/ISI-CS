 Wednesday, July 23, 2003 				 Blood test mess miffs minister
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee on Tuesday threatened to move a consumer forum against a private hospital for allegedly botching up his blood sugar reports. 																								The minister described the reports as doubtful, and varying every time. He said men from the hospital had taken blood samples from his residence on July 17. The result was 315 mg. He got the same test done from Apollo Gleneagles, on the EM Bypass, and Roy amp; Tribedi, on Park Street, the following day. The first showed the blood sugar count as 241 mg and the second as 180 mg. Chatterjee then got a third test done at National Medical College and Hospital on Tuesday. The result was 140 mg. 																								How can one blame hospitals when this is the condition of private clinics? he asked. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was apprised of the muddle, and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said he had asked officials to probe the matter.																								Atanu Guhathakurta, manager (operations) of Apollo Gleneagles, said: We stand by our reports.

																								Four ordinary women  a mother and her three daughters, and some others surrounding them. Their happiness and sorrows, their yearnings, their desires and their frustrations are all very familiar to us. But there are momentary flashes that tend to disturb the apparent calmness, the equilibrium of our known world. Once confronted by antagonistic and insurmountable odds, a protagonist is forced to take up cudgels. And then each ones battle becomes part of that universal strife to establish ones identity and each one is a hero. Based on a Marathi play by Prashant Dalvi, Gandhar premiers this production today.With this play, Meghnad Bhattacharya makes his directorial debut outside his own group, Sayak. Performers include Bijoylakshmi Barman, Manasi Sinha, Meghna Lahiri and Mandira Bandopadhyay.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

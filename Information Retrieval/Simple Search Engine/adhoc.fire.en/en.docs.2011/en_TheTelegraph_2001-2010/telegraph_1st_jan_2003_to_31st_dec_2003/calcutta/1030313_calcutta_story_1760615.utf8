 Thursday, March 13, 2003 				 Road rage after man knocked down by bus
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Residents of S.N. Banerjee Road turned violent after a 52-year-old man was knocked down and injured by a private bus. 																								The mob damaged two private buses while protesting rash driving. The injured  identified as Shankar Mandal  was admitted to Nilratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital. His condition was stated to be critical.																								Police said the accident took place around 11 am, when two private buses on route 39 were racing along S.N. Banerjee Road. Mandal, who was walking down Taltala Avenue, was knocked down by one of the buses.																								As Mandal fell, bystanders turned violent. They dragged out one of the drivers and started beating him up. The other driver, however, managed to flee, said K.L. Tamta, deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).																								As word of the mishap spread, more people joined the mob and blocked the road, causing a snarl that lasted over an hour. Part of the crowd tried to break open the fuel tanks of two buses and set them on fire. The police brought the situation under control.																								The demonstrators demanded immediate effective measures to check incidents of rash driving. They alleged that instead of controlling vehicles, the traffic constables busy themselves collecting bribes from goods vehicles. The blockade was lifted after senior officers assured the demonstrators that necessary action would be taken to curb incidents of rash driving.

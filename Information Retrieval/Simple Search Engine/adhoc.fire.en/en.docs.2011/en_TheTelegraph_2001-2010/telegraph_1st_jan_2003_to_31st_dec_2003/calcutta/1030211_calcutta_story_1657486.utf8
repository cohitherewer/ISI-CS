The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Vignettes from a distant land
  The artist in his work ought to be like God in creation, invisible and all powerful, everywhere felt but nowhere visible  Gustave FlaubertThe names of Sung-Yong Kim and Byong-Jib Song may sound alien to Calcuttans but a look at their works and we realise instantly how true Flaubert was in his observation. The two artists from Korea  sculptor Sung-Yong Kim and painter Byong-Jib Song present a vast kaleidoscope that encompasses both nature in its pristine beauty and humans in myriad moods. Their appeal is universal. Moreover, viewers will be surprised to discover a familiar strain in the works of Sung-Yong Kim who, incidentally, graduated with Advance Diploma, Sculpture from Kala Bhavan, Visva Bharati University, Santiniketan in 1998. At present, he is member of Korea National Association of Sculptors and lecturer at Han Nam University, Soon Chun Hyang University and Taejon Fine Arts High School. Byong-Jib Song is also actively involved with various art organisations and teaches art at Chung-nam University and Chung-nam Arts High School.When: Till February 20; 3 pm - 8 pmWhere: Chitrakoot  Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, March 20, 2003 				 Waves that connect the aged
		 Deepak Mitra THE 70-YEAR-OLD is on Mission Possible  to  make people sit up and take notice of the deteriorating  plight of the elderly. And Deepak Mitras tool of choice  is his retired but not tired self. Social work for him  is not just a matter of hobby, but his way of giving back  to society some of what he is thankful for.																								The former wireless officer of the Air Force uses his knowledge and skill in the use of HAM radio to reunite families and get people back home during festivals and crowded melas, and help bring relief to areas struck by natural calamities.																								Cyclone-devastated Orissa saw him put his skills to use in 1999. The oldest member in the HAM group from Calcutta helped aid reach on time, through portable radios.																								Where all communication was cut off, we used the radios to connect the police and other authorities to the government and relief agencies in Bhubaneshwar and Delhi, he explains. But sometimes, there wasnt even clean drinking water. We occasionally gave away our rations to starving children.																								After retirement in 1991, the employee of the telecommunications department of the government of India, decided to dedicate himself to social work. His logic was simple: I will wear myself out, but will not sit and rust, he declares.																								HAM teams set up checkpoints during Ganga Sagar Mela and Durga Puja, to trace the missing and assist them in finding their loved ones. Sometimes the elderly are abandoned by their families. Sometimes, people go missing. Its sad to see the plight of helpless, illiterate villagers, on their first visit to a city, who dont even know what station they got on from, he says.																								During last years Puja, Mitra, despite being ill, monitored the lost-and-found-operation from the makeshift headquarters at his Sarat Bose Road residence. The whole experience is so satisfying, that I never want to stop.																								The life-member of the Calcutta Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology  where we study the status of the aged below the poverty line  has been to field distribution of medicine drives and medical check-up camps. Its depressing to see people fall ill because of the filthy conditions they live in, and not have the money to buy medicines.																								The sponsor of two elderly ladies for HelpAge Indias adopt a granny programme is a member of Dignity Foundation, where he volunteers with the helpline and goes on companionship visits to homes of senior citizens who put in distress calls, as well as to old age homes.																								In a few years, by all accounts, 10 per cent of the citys population will be over 60. We have to let people know that we will fight for a peaceful and dignified existence in the autumn of our lives, he sums up.

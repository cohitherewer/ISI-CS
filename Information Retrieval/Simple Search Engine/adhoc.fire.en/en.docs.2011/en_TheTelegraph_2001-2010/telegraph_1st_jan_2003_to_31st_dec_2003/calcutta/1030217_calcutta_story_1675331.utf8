																								Chhattisgarh is a potent combination of the old and the new. Here one gets a feel of the states natural beauty along with its cultural diversity. A journey through Chhattisgarh helps one discover a whole new world in its vast tracts of unpolluted, tranquil Bastar, one of the last frontiers of tribal India. Almost 75 per cent of Bastars population comprises tribal groups, each with its own indigenous culture of spirits, deities, dialects, customs and food habits. Swabhumi, in association with Government of Chhattisgarh, is holding a week-long Chhattisgarh Festival that showcases the states textiles (like Kosa silk), dress material, tribal jewellery, handicraft items like bell metal, wrought iron items, wood crafting, terracotta, bamboo flute, and tribal bow and arrow. The states crafts and craftspeople play a significant role not just as part of its cultural and aesthetic past, but as part of its economic future. The festival also features performances by the Pandavani group and the colourful Nacha dance.																								 When: Till today																								Where: Swabhumi

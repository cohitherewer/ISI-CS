There should be self-censorship by the authors, which should be a sufficient guard. After all, when a writer is honest to his work, he generally avoids unnecessarily sensitive issues. The reader should be free to take a decision. There was so much talk over Henry Millers Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn because of an overdose of sex. Some liked them, some didnt. Thankfully, the books were not banned, like D.H. Lawrences Lady Chatterleys Lover was.

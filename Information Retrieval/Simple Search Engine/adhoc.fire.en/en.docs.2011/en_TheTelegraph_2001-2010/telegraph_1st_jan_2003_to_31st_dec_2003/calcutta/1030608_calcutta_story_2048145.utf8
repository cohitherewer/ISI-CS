 Sunday, June 08, 2003 				 Rhino horn trade link to Thanga
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Fugitive druglord San Niang Thanga had been a rhino horn smuggler in the Northeast before joining the international drug cartel, called 125. 																								Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) officials made this revelation on Saturday in course of their probe into the drug racket, believed to be the Calcutta unit of 125, that was busted on the ground floor of former CBI additional director Upen Biswas Salt Lake residence on May 19. 																								He was earlier found to have been involved in smuggling other wildlife products, like cheraw horn and pangolin skin.																								According to NCB officials, who are now interrogating Thangas five associates  three Myanmarese and two Chinese  netted from Biswas house, Thanga used to work for an arms smuggling gang as well.																								Thanga had been caught while smuggling rhino horns and arms. He was booked under Wildlife Protection Act and Arms Act a year-and-a-half ago, but was granted bail later, said an NCB official, adding that a Customs officer of superintendent rank and a lieutenant-colonel had helped him get bail. We are talking to the authorities in the Northeast to trace them, said an NCB sleuth.																								Thangas success caught the attention of Kim Cheung Wong  the 57-year-old kingpin of 125, who was arrested a couple of weeks ago in China during an undercover operation launched by the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Wong had picked up Thanga and assigned him to look after his business in the Northeast. Acting on Wongs instruction, Thanga came to Salt Lake and set up the amphetamine-type stimulant manufacturing laboratory, said an NCB official.

 Friday, April 04, 2003 				 CU script review boon for students 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The answer-script review mechanism of Calcutta University (CU) has, at last, proved a point to the benefit of its students. 																								Hundreds of unsuccessful students in the 2002 BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I examinations, who had applied for a review of their scripts, will be able to write the 2003 Part II exams after they were declared passed in the review.																								For the first time in the recent history of the university, students have been able to derive the benefit of the review system. A large number of candidates who failed the 2002 BA, B.Sc and B.Com Part I, will appear in the corresponding Part II exams this year, after their marks were increased in the review, said Suranjan Das, CU pro vice-chancellor, academic.																								Alarmed at the spiralling court cases filed by aggrieved students, the university authorities this year took a string of measures to clear review results within three months from the date of application. The idea was to allow sufficient time to those who pass in the review to prepare for the Part II exams, scheduled to begin by this month-end.																								Over the years, the university announced review results at a time when the following years Part II exams were almost over. As a result, successful applicants had no option but to repeat the Part I, losing an academic year in the process.																								Sources in the examination department said a new decision to abolish the practice of deducting 50 per cent of the total enhanced marks obtained by the examinees after the review has enabled many failed students to manage a pass percentage.																								In the old system, if a students marks in a particular paper increased by 10, only five was actually added to the original marksheet.

Women and rebels? In India? Sounds like a figment of imagination  an idle womans day-dream. But as choreographer/dancer Sanjukta Banerjee says, the essence of rebel women of India is well-illustrated through the words of Swami Vivekananda: Strength is what the Upanishad speaks to me from every page, therein lies strength enough to invigorate the whole world. They will call with trumpet voice upon the weak, the miserable and the downtrodden... to stand on their feet and be free. Freedom (is) the watchword of the Upanishad. Gutsy women down the ages have raised their voices and rebelled against every possible forms of oppression and injustice. This ballet, scripted by Maitrei Sengupta, will be presented by Banerjee herself. It features five historical figures, all women, who conquer their inner turmoil with the selfas they gear up to raise their voices of dissent and rebel against set norms and traditions. Prior to the ballet, students of Saugandhikam will present Rhythm of Enchantment, featuring selective Bharata Natyam pieces. 																								When: Today at 6 pm 																								Where: Gyan Manch

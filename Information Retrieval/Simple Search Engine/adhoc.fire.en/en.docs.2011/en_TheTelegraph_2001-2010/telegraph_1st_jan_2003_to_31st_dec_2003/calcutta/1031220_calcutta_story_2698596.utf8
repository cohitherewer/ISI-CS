 																											- Govt scouts for partner to help set up fair complex off the Bypass OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								When it comes to the business of doing business, private partnership is the loudest chant in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal. The latest endeavour in which the Bengal government is eyeing a substantial role for private players is the international trade fair complex, coming up off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.																								Commerce secretary Sabyasachi Sen made it clear on Friday that private participation would be sought in the West Bengal Trade Promotion Organisation, the joint-venture company floated by the International Trade Promotion Organisation and the government, to develop the complex.																								We need funds to develop the trade fair complex. The commerce ministry and the International Trade Promotion Organisation will give us some money, but the government will also have to garner funds. Keeping that in mind, we will invite private participation for the project, said Sen, at the inauguration of the 17th Industrial India Trade Fair.																								The state trade promotion organisation will set up the trade fair complex on an 18-acre plot. We will be inviting bids shortly for project designers and architects, Sen added.																								The trade fair has drawn participants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Iran and Vietnam, this years partner country. The Bengal National Chamber of Commerce, which organises this fair, expects over 700 companies to participate.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who lit the lamp at Fridays inaugural function on the Maidan, said: Bengal is the gateway to South and Southeast Asia. The neighbouring countries participating in the fair will enjoy easy access to the region through Bengal.																								Bhattacharjee went on to present a progress report of the states industrial growth. Over the past 11 years, 162 new units in the iron and steel sector, involving an investment of around Rs 6,947 crore, have been set up in the state, he said.																								Eighty-seven such projects, worth Rs 200 crore, are in the pipeline, added the chief minister. Around 602 Haldia Petrochem downstream units have also come up.																								We are receiving encouraging investments in the IT sector, though we have started late. Our vision is to be a leader in IT, with a 15 per cent share in the countrys software exports by 2010, declared Bhattacharjee.

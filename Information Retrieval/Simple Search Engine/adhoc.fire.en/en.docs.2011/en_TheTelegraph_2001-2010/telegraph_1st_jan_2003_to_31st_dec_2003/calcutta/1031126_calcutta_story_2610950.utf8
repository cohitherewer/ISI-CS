The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, November 26, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	The 2.5 km AJC Bose Road flyover, from the Race course  to Park Circus, is one of the few good things that have  happened to the city of late. Some days ago, I reached the  airport from Behala in just half an hour. The construction  of the Taratala flyover is, however, taking an abnormal  amount of time. I have often seen drivers falling asleep  while waiting at the traffic signal. The company assigned  the construction job is dragging its feet over the project.  With the lack of machinery and slow pace of work, I dont  think the flyover will even be near completion in the next  five to six years.

	Finding public transport between Shyambazar and Salt Lake  is a major problem for students of Kendriya Vidyalaya and  Bidhannagar College. The only CSTC bus on route L14C, starting  from Bagbazar, is very erratic, while the two private buses  on routes 32A and 201 are always overcrowded. More buses  need to be introduced.

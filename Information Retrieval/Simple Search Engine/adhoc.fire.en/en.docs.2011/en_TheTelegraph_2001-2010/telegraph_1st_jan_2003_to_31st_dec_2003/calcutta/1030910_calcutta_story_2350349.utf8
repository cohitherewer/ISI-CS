The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, September 10, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Spare students the tax toll
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should educational institutions be exempted from paying property taxes? More letters will be published next week									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury,
																		Barrackpore.																																																														Educational institutions are the pillars of society. But only directly-controlled state institutions and institutions aided by the state, where the fees are nominal, should be exempt from the purview of paying property tax. It would be wrong to extend the same facility to private educational institutions, because their sole motive is to make money and in doing that, they charge hefty sums in the name of infrastructural facilities. 									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
																		Behala.																																																														No. Taxes are realised by civic bodies for various kinds of civic amenities provided by them to the tax-payers, like supply of water, street-lighting, conservancy services, garbage clearance, etc. Educational institutions are not charitable institutions. They charge money from the students.									

Arpita Bhattacharyya,
																		Dum Dum Cantonment.																																																														Nowadays, educational institutions are feathering their nests by charging high admission, tuition and other fees from students. The institutions keep a high margin of profit and hence, the government should feel free to impose property tax on them.																																																														P. Pramanik, 									

Santoshpur Avenue. 
																		nYes, they should be exempted, provided documents are produced as evidence that they have actually spent the money for the benefit of education. 									

Subhasish Majumdar, 
																		Sonarpur. 																																																														Educational institutions do not aim at achieving profits from tuition fees and donations. Whatever surplus is generated at the end of every financial year is spent for infrastructural improvement. So long as the government considers education to be a genuine step for the prosperity of a nation, the question of collecting property tax from educational institutions should not arise.									

Rina Jaiswal, 
																		Baidyabati.																																																														I agree with the idea of exempting educational institutions from paying property tax. Educational institutions have to hike their fees to pay the tax and many students lose a chance to go for higher studies, being unable to afford the fees. 									

Subhadip Chanda, 
																		Address not given.																																																														No way. Nowadays, many private educational institutions are coming up for sheer commercial interest. Many of the mushrooming private engineering colleges, for instance, do not even have a proper faculty or infrastructure. They are a major source of income for their authorities. So, like other commercial properties, they should also pay property tax.									

Fakhre Alam, 
																		Tiljala Lane.																																																														Educational institutions should not be exempt from paying property tax, because most private schools charge exorbitant fees from their students. If they can demand high fees, why should they be exempt from paying property tax? But institutions which charge nominal fees from students should be treated more leniently. 									

Madhusree Gupta,
																		Anil Roy Road. 																																																														In a country where the government is by the people and for the people, taxes are imposed for public benefit. Today, educational institutions comprise one of the most profitable spheres. So, why should they be exempt from paying property taxes when the money obtained from such taxes, if properly and honestly utilised, can do immense good to the people, like providing free education to those who need it?									

Amitava Mukherjee, 
																		Barrackpore.																																																														No. Educational institutions shouldnt be exempt from paying property taxes. 									

Sarfaraz Ahmad, 
																		Radha Govinda Shah Lane.																																																														Of course. The tax levied on the institution is indirectly passed on to the student. The poor pupil has to bear the tax burden in the form of a hiked fee. Second, the colleges have to tackle union problems, class boycott etc, which crop up due to fee-hike decisions. 									

B.N. Bose, 
																		Dum Dum Park.																																																														With the rise in market prices as well as rise in salaries of teachers and staff, it is advisable to exempt educational institutions from paying property tax. Moreover, educational institutions play a vital role in society. Exempting property tax may help schools and colleges to keep tuition fees to a minimum, which will be a great boon for students. Most of our educational institutions need urgent maintenance. This exemption may help undertake some immediate repair work. 									

Govinda Bakshi,
																		Budge Budge.																																																														Gone are the days of yore when educational institutions rendered yeomans service irrespective of the rich and the poor alike. But at present, education has become a marketable commodity, and institutions are run for mercenary motives. Such elite institutions should pay heavy property tax.									

Sunil Banerjee, 
																		VIP Road.																																																														Educational institutions should definitely be exempt from property tax. This is precisely because they are not business houses or production units like factories or shops and establishments which earn money for their trades and should obviously be made to fork out property tax. Educational institutions, even the private ones, need this money for maintenance and purchasing educational equipment. 									

Santosh Chakravarty, 
																		Unique Park. 																																																														The imposition of property tax in a metropolitan city is a repulsive thought, because city land does not produce any yield. Educational institutions should pay municipality tax for enjoying civic amenities. No property tax should, however, be imposed on them. If this is done, the burden is bound to be passed on to the students by way of hike in tuition fees. That is undesirable. Rather, exemption from property tax in their case may be taken as hidden government subsidy.

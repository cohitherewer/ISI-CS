 Sunday, February 23, 2003 				 State call for private aid in education 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								State higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty on Saturday called on private parties to invest in the education sector in Bengal. 																								It is not possible for the government to shoulder the cost of education alone. Instead, private entrepreneurs should come forward to stand by the government as we are currently passing through a financial crisis, Chakraborty said at the inauguration of Sarsuna College, in Behala, during the day. 																								Former chief minister Jyoti Basu, who had laid the foundation stone three years ago, opened the college on Saturday. According to Basu, the state pumps in nearly 30 per cent of its total budget for educational purposes. However, its funny that the Centre does not even spend 10 per cent of its budget for education, he said. 																								Former CPM MLA Nirmal Mukherjee, on behalf of the college, said the Trinamul Congress-run Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) had rendered a helping hand in the project. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee gave us land for the college on lease. He has also written off civic taxes considering our financial position. MPs from all parties have donated generously from their local area development funds, Nirmal Mukherjee said.																								Meet on mapping																								The National Atlas amp; Thematic Mapping Organisation, along with the International Cartographic Association, is organising a two-day international conference on the current trends of national and regional atlases at Science City, starting Saturday.																								The concept of mapping is changing. Digital technology associated with global positioning systems is helping us to switch over from analogue mapping to a purely digital one, said Bengt Rystedt, president of International Cartographic Association, while inaugurating the conference. Several map books, including one for the visually handicapped, were released on the occasion.

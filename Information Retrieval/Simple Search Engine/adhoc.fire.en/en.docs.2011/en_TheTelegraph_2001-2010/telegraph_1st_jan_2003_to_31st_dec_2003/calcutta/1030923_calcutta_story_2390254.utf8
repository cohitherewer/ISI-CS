 Tuesday, September 23, 2003 				 Traffic signals to rein in southern chaos
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alarmed at the increasing chaos on the roads in the southern stretches of the city, the administration has drawn up plans to regulate traffic movement in South 24-Parganas.																								Officials said on Monday that several schemes, prepared in consultation with agencies like the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBTIDC), Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), Metro Railway and private agencies, would be put into place after the Pujas. The regulations will be enforced at Garia, Bansdroni, Tollygunge, Behala, Thakurpukur and Jadavpur.																								Deputy superintendent of police (traffic) Sakil Ahmed said: We are deeply concerned about the traffic snarls in these areas. The expansion of pockets like Garia, Bagha Jatin and Tollygunge has aggravated the situation, he added. In addition, work on the Taratala flyover had thrown traffic out of gear on Diamond Harbour Road.																								Traffic signals will be erected at the crossings of Behala Chowrasta, Garia, in front of Jadavpur University and the Tollygunge Metro Railway station. The WBTIDC has agreed to instal the lights after discussions with the district police.																								Also at the Tollygunge Metro station, gaps between the dividers will be reduced to prevent commuters from haphazardly crossing Deshapran Sashmal Road. The Metro authorities have agreed to carry out the work. 																								 The other plans chalked out include shifting the route 205 bus terminus on NSC Bose Road at Bansdroni to an adjacent spot close to Tollys Nullah. The auto stand at Garia, too, will be shifted to a spot off Tollys Nullah to keep Raja SC Mullick Road free from congestion. We have identified a plot near the proposed Garia Metro station. Work to develop the land will start after the Pujas. Here, more than 1,000 autos can be parked at a time. This, we hope, will reduce congestion, said deputy superintendent Ahmed. 																								Apart from regulating traffic movement in the district, the administration plans to increase the flow of traffic in pockets like Ajoynagar and Kamal Gazi. We have held talks with officials of the CMDA. With its help, we will not only regulate traffic but will also illuminate stretches of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass,  he added.																								Presently, in these areas, traffic guards remain on duty on two shifts. The first shift is from 8 am to noon, the second from 4 pm to 9 pm. We plan to keep the traffic guards from 8 am to 9 pm without a break. We are short-staffed, but after the installation of signals at different points, we will have some extra guards, the deputy superintendent said. So, there is no immediate need for a fresh recruitment drive, he added.

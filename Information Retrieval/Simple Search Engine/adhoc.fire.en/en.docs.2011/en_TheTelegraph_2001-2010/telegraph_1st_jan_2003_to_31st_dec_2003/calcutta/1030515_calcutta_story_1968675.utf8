 Thursday, May 15, 2003 				 Repair route for great escape car Rollout plan for Netajis sedan
 															- Wheels in motion to roll out Netajis German sedan for birthday tribute 2004 DEVADEEP PUROHIT				 	 VINTAGE WARRIOR: Netajis Wanderer W24, parked at Netaji Bhavan, Elgin Road. Picture by Pabitra Das																								The wonder wheels of Wanderer W24 will roll once more. January 23, 2004, should see the historic, four-door German sedan that Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose used on the night of January 16, 1941, for his great escape from Calcutta, hitting the city streets.																								With the Netaji Research Bureau drawing up grand plans to showcase the car during Netajis birthday celebrations next year, the vehicle, parked on the ground floor of Netaji Bhavan, 38/2, Elgin Road, since 1957, must be made road-worthy. Its no longer in running condition and it needs a lot of repair. The car is very significant and was one of the first items to be included in the Netaji museum, along with his letters to Chittaranjan Das and a Buddha idol, disclosed parliamentarian Krishna Bose, also chairperson of the Bureau.																								Netajis nephews wife cant recall the last time the German sedan last pulled out of Elgin Road since being used in a 1979 Japanese film on Netaji, where Sisir Bose drove the car for a shot. While making his film on Netaji, Shyam Benegal contacted us recently and wanted to use the car. But it couldnt be used, as it was not roadworthy, quot; added Bose.																								When Boses son Sugata, who teaches history in Harvard, came down in March, the Bureau decided to set the makeover wheels in motion. Sugata contacted Siddharth Swarup, whose vintage car was used by Benegal.																								I grabbed the offer and after checking the car closely, I had a meeting with him (Sugata) and his mother (Krishna Bose) at Netaji Bhavan. They wanted a detailed proposal, said Swarup, a young industrialist and an old car enthusiast.																								For Swarup, the Netaji car project is a brush with the history of Indias freedom struggle.																								After going through the original registration booklet and sales catalogue of the 1937-make, 1.8-litre, four-cylinder, 42 HP car, and rigorous research, Swarup sent a detailed proposal to Sugata in early April. I received a mail from him last week and he has given me the green signal. Now, I will have to coordinate with Krishna Bose.																								According to Swarup, the car needs a complete makeover, from engine and suspension to electrical wiring and the entire leather upholstery. He, however, refused to disclose the estimated project cost. Its indeed an exciting project for me, as I will have to restore the car as close as possible to the original model. The condition of repairing it inside Netaji Bhavan  as laid down by Dr Sugata Bose  will make it even more challenging, added Swarup, confident of completing the restoration work well within the deadline of January 23, 2004.

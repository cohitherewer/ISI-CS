																																																		Several  illegal structures, including shops and a motor garage in  front of Hyatt Regency, were demolished in Salt Lake on Saturday.  This was the first leg of a major eviction drive planned in  the township. The drive was jointly conducted by the police  and Bidhannagar Municipality. We have also demolished a hoarding,  which although was authorised, was causing visual pollution,  said Baidyanath Mondal, municipality executive officer. Some  public toilets, causing environmental pollution for years,  have also been demolished, he said. A wall along the road  has been constructed to prevent future encroachment. 																																																		Three  armed youths entered a three-storeyed building at Ballygunge  Place on Saturday afternoon and robbed Chitra Lahiri, 75,  of cash and jewellery. Police said Lahiris domestic help  had left the main door ajar. The youths walked in and snatched  Rs 5000 and gold ornaments. 																																																		Subhashish  Sarkar, 35, of Bansdroni, who was abducted by a gang of five  on Friday morning for a ransom of Rs 2 lakh, was released  later in the day. The gang intercepted Subhashishs car near  Bhowanipore, police said. They dragged him out, blindfolded  him and took him to an unknown place. The abductors then called  Subhashishs father for a ransom of Rs 2 lakh. But around  10.30 pm, they released him in New Alipore after snatching  his cellphone and gold ring. 																																																		Train  services in the Sealdah South section were disrupted after  passengers blocked tracks at Sonarpur station on Saturday  morning. The agitators were demanding two pairs of trains  from Sonarpur. Several trains were cancelled as a result.

	The Corporation has installed plastic dustbins at several  street-corners. It is nice to see such a shift in the attitude  of an organisation that does not have a very encouraging  record for cleanliness. The overflowing garbage vats stand  testimony to that.

	Last Sunday, we had boarded an S-2 CSTC bus. I handed over  a Rs 50 note to the conductor and asked for five tickets  of Rs 7 each. The total fare was Rs 35. But the conductor  returned the note on the pretext that he did not have any  change. As we neared our destination, he took the Rs 50  note from me and returned Rs 30, minus the tickets. When  I demanded the tickets with the exact fare, he replied he  was trying to save money for me. When I insisted, he gave  me the tickets after deducting the fare very reluctantly.  Why should law-abiding citizens be forced to resort to malpractices?  
	S. Ram, School Road.

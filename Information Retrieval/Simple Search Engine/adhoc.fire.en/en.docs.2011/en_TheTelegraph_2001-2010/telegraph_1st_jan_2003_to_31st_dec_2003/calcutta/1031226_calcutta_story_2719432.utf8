 - MAID PRIME SUSPECT IN SLAUGHTER OF HOUSEWIFE  Neighbours and relatives of Gayatri  Singhal mourn her killing at her New Alipore apartment.  Picture by Pradip Sanyal A murder most macabre bloodied  Calcuttas Christmas canvas and cast an ever-lengthening  shadow on a vulnerable section of our society  the ageing  and the alone. Early on Thursday, Gayatri Singhal,  52, was first hit on the head and then had her throat slit,  probably with a sharp kitchen instrument, at her New Alipore  residence while her husband was away in Mumbai on a business  trip and her son was on holiday in Kerala. The needle of suspicion points  at a trusted member of the Singhal household  maidservant  Rina. While Rina is absconding  just as Rs 3 lakh in cash  and ornaments worth several lakhs are missing from the fourth-floor  flat of Neelachal Apartments, in New Alipores O Block   driver Mahadev Ram is being questioned for his role in her  getaway. Police reconstructed the crime  on the basis of what Mahadev and the neighbours had to say.  Rina, apparently, woke the driver up around 5 am. She was  carrying three polythene packets and was in a real rush.  She asked me to drop her off at a Block-D address, where  her sister worked, Mahadev told police. Rina told me that her child was  sick and so maaji (Gayatri Singhal) had given her  leave and asked her to return home, the driver added. Mahadev  dropped Rina off and came back. At around 8.30 am, he was  told by the sweeper that Gayatri was not opening the door.  The driver rushed up to the flat and noticed the morning  newspaper and the pouch of milk lying untouched outside  the door. He rang the bell in vain for around 20 minutes. Mahadev then called in some neighbours,  before opening the door with a duplicate key. A trail of  blood led them to the bedroom and to Gayatris lifeless  body. It was evident that she had been hit on the back of  her head with a heavy object before her throat was slit.  The cover of a knife was also found.  We have sent a team to Rinas  Sagar Island home and a watch is being kept on all Orissa-bound  trains. Her husband works there, said deputy commissioner  (south) Anuj Sharma. But she could have left the city by  the morning Dhauli Express, said another official. A close  watch was also being kept on Mahadev. Rina had first joined the Singhal  home as a domestic help five years ago. She left after about  a year, but returned a few months ago. The Singhals, the  probe suggested, were happy to have her back, as they trusted  Rina. Banwarilal Singhal, the victims  husband, has a chartered accountancy firm on Bentinck Street.  He would frequently leave town on work and Gayatri often  had to stay alone. Son Vikas, who was helping his father  run the firm, would also be out on tour often, while daughter  Meghna is married and lives in Salt Lake.  So, Rina seemed a safe choice  for the Singhals. Christmas proved them horribly wrong.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 02, 2003  Soumen Mitra								Deputy commissioner, detective department, Calcutta Police																																							Ensuring security of a bank should be the banks lookout. It is not possible for the police to shoulder such a responsibility. We have patrol teams doing the rounds, which can keep an eye on the banks in the locality. But the banks must have their own security system. We cannot force them to do this, but only put forth our suggestions. At the annual police-bank meeting, we have asked representatives of Allahabad Bank, the nodal agency in the east, to make it mandatory for all banks to instal basic security measures  guards, alarm, close-circuit TV. But the banks seldom pay heed.

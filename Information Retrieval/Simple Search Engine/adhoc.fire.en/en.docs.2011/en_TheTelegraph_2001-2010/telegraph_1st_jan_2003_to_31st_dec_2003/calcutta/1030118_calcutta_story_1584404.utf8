The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, January 18, 2003 				 Safety Week toll mounts
 A STAFF REPORTER																								There was more blood on the streets of Calcutta on Day V of Road Safety Week, with the death of a motorcyclist and an unidentified woman on Sukanta Setu, in Santoshpur.																								The motorcycle was hit by a speeding Matador around 1 pm on Tuesday. Rajesh Kumar Singh, additional superintendent of police (industrial) of South 24-Parganas, said Supriyo Mukherjee, 46, who was riding the motorcycle, was declared brought dead when rushed to a private hospital.																								An unidentified woman died on the spot. There was some confusion over whether she was riding pillion (as stated by the police) or was a pedestrian (as claimed by Supriyos family). The driver of the Matador has been arrested, said Singh.																								Supriyo, a resident of Ramlalbazar, in the East Jadavpur police station area, suffered multiple head injuries, doctors at the hospital said. He was earlier employed with a television company but had recently quit the job and was to start his own business. 																								On Friday afternoon, he was on his way back home after a visit to his ailing father-in-law at a private medical centre in Salt Lake.																								Traffic movement in the Jadavpur-Santoshpur area was affected following the accident. The disruption continued for over an hour, said Singh, as residents took to the streets demanding that the Raja Subodh Mullick Road-Sukanta Setu junction be properly manned by the police. 																								This is such a busy junction, but a solitary constable is seen struggling to manage the speeding vehicles, said Ujjal Sen, a resident of the area. 																								Adding to the death toll during Road Safety Week  which witnessed a macabre accident at the Park Street-Jawaharlal Nehru Road crossing on Wednesday  one person succumbed to his injuries following an accident on PWD Road, near Vivekananda Setu, in the Baranagar police station area late on Thursday night. Police said in the accident, a truck hit a scooter. Jayanta Chatterjee, 45, died on the spot while another unidentified person, riding pillion, suffered serious injuries.																								Jayanta, a resident of Baduria, in North 24-Parganas, was on his way to Howrah when the killer truck rammed into his scooter. The truck was impounded but the driver fled.																								nPicture on Page 17

 Thursday, December 11, 2003 				 Choreographic homage
																								Nrittakshetra, an academy for performing arts, hosts a solo Bharata Natyam recital by Anasuya Banerjee. In the first half, she presents Nikkan, traversing the classical Bharatiyam Margam and depicting a few of its milestone items beginning with Pushpanjali and then moving on to the more complex and visually stunning Meenakshi Varnam and Padam. The second half of Banerjees repertoire, titled Atma  The Soul, is a choreographic homage to the great Tamil poet, Subramania Bharathi, on his 121st birth annivesary. Delving into the literary treasures of Bharathi, the composition presents the various facets of his personality. Banerjee, who has also choreographed the item, has selectively used various aspects of dance, yoga and theatre in her composition to convey the fire of Bharathis patriotism, his love of nature, his vision of a modern India, his passion for his beloved, his simple yet high philosophy, and his spiritualism.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Sisir Mancha

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 04, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Tenant tips for insolent cops
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should house-owners be penalised if they fail to inform the police about tenants? More letters will be published next week Under rented roof: One of Upen Biswas' tenants being  led away Manik Lal Roy,
																		Budge Budge.																																																														In a big city like Calcutta, the number of tenants is high and given the police strength, it would not be possible to study the antecedents of all them. But if the tenants are from other states or unacquainted with the house-owners, such a provision should be made. Government employees can be skipped from this list.  Debashish Chakraborty,
																		Chitpur.																																																														House-owners should definitely be penalised if they fail to inform the police about their tenants. The landlord needs to keep an eye on the whereabouts of his tenants, especially as to what they are doing on the premises. Tenants promise to abide by norms laid down by landlords when they move in, but they are often found to be involved in illegal transactions. House-owners must inform the police against tenants if they get a whiff of unlawful activities. 									

Chandan Ray,
																		Sarsuna.																																																														House-owners must be penalised if they fail to inform the police about their tenants. It can be viewed as a goodwill gesture to avoid unpleasant situations. All agreements made between tenants and landlords must be registered in court. The police can retain copies of the documents with the tenants photographs. Citizens in positions of responsibility must be made a witness to the testimonies. 									

Santosh Chakravarty,
																		Unique Park.																																																														Of course, but only after a proper enactment is put in place. If the police are not helped with information, one cant expect them to catch miscreants swiftly. If the tenant is a foreigner, it should be made mandatory for the landlord to verify his travel documents and inform the police accordingly. This is not planting the seeds of mistrust, but is an act of prudence. The recent narcotics episode at former CBI additional director Upen Biswas Salt Lake house is an eye-opener. 									

Megh Nath Basu,
																		Dhakuria.																																																														House-owners must inform the police if they notice any sort of illegal activities on the premises they have rented out. But they should not be penalised because it is not possible to identify a rogue in a thickly-populated city like ours. Most interesting news is that the CMC plans to simplify the trade licence regulations, enabling tenants to start business on the rented premises.									

R.P. Majumder,
																		CIT Buildings.																																																														House-owners are duty-bound to intimate the police and the municipal authorities in their own interest and in the interest of the general public when they let out their houses. Failing to do this is surely a lapse and they are liable to be prosecuted for this sort of negligence and should be penalised if found guilty under the CrPC rules.									

Madhumita Dutta,
																		Haridevpur.																																																														Before penalising house-owners in the matter, there should be a regulation making it compulsory for them to intimate the police about their tenants. Simultaneously, the local police should be duty-bound to act on an FIR or any intimation they receive from house-owners about their tenant(s) and their activities and movements and help the house-owners.									

Somnath Dey,
																		Haridevpur.																																																														There should be some regulation that requires a house-owner to intimate the police about his tenant. The police should not harass either the tenant or the house-owner. House-owners should be penalised once the police infrastructure for receiving complaints from house-owners is in place.									

Seraj Alam,
																		Bansberia.																																																														Yes, house-owners should be penalised if they fail to inform the police about their tenants. 									

Virendra Shah,
																		Amratalla Lane.																																																														It is a good idea if house-owners are forced to inform police about their tenants. But going by their track record, it is doubtful if the police will be able to bring defaulters to book. It will be giving them one more way to harass ordinary people. Let the onus be on the house-owner to be fully satisfied about the background of his tenants. After all, he has to be careful for the sake of his own life and property. House-owners may voluntarily inform the police about their tenants.									

Debulal Dutta,
																		Sukantapally.																																																														House-owners should definitely not be penalised if they dont inform the police about their tenants. It is not possible for landlords to do so in the case of guest houses, where tenants stay only for a few days. Besides, police officials do not always co-operate with people who go to the thana to provide information. Unless there is a law in regard to this, there is no compulsion for a house-owner to provide information about his tenant.									

Fakhre Alam,
																		Tiljala Lane.																																																														House-owners should be penalised if they intentionally hide information from the police. If the tenants are involved in any illegal activities, then it is the house-owners responsibility to inform the police. House-owners who are innocent and unaware of their tenants activities, should be given a second chance. 									

P. Pramanik,
																		Santoshpur Avenue.																																																														It is safest to rent out a house only after proper verification of the antecedents of the would-be tenants. Even then, the landlord should keep a close watch, and inform the police if anything suspicious is detected. Ignorance is no excuse.									

Indraneel Mukherjee,
																		Kidderpore.																																																														With Calcutta fast getting a reputation for being a haven for criminals, house-owners should inform the police about their tenants for their own security. This might assist the police to trace the tenants if they are upto any mischief. Innocent landlords can thus save themselves from facing complications. Though it is debatable whether it is practically possible to keep a record of tenants, penalising landlords if they fail to keep the cops informed about their tenants can prove effective. There should be a deadline for registering the information. This must not become an avenue of income for cops.

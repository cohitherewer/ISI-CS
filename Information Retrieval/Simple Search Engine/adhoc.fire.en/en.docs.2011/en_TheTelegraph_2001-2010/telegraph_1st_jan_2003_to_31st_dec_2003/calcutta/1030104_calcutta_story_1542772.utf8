The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, January 04, 2003  City Lights
 Through the looking glass With  the city on the threshold of a retail revolution, theres  a lot to look forward to in the New Year. Heres eavesdropping  on the 2003 biz buzz from four of the the biggies: Range of choices on the racks at Pantaloons  After rewriting retail rules  in town, the garments and lifestyle major is looking at  even greater penetration. The success of the hypermart model  has prompted the retail giant to go for two more Big Bazaar  outlets. One will be a large-format food mart spread across  20,000-sq. ft inside Metropolis, the giant shopping mall  at Hiland Park, stocking all kinds of processed and semi-processed  food at wholesale prices. We are also looking for a location  of around 50,000 sq. ft in central Calcutta to set up another  full-fledged Big Bazaar, says Kishore Biyani, managing  director, Panlatoon (India) Pvt Ltd. The chain, which logged  sales in excess of Rs 4 crore from its 22, Camac Street  outlet in December alone, is also scouting for land in south  Calcutta for a very large store to house both Pantaloons  and Big Bazaar.  Plus, Pantaloons is launching  its exclusive range of World Cup cricket merchandise this  week. Even as the music industry, in  general, slumped by 30 per cent, MusicWorld, the RPG Group  store on Park Street clocked robust sales in December.  The countrys number one music store, with a Rs 8-crore  turnover in 2001-02, is eyeing a 10-15 per cent growth  in the new financial year, and hopes to achieve this through  the shop-in-shop models, Express and Unplugged.  The first MusicWorld Express outlet  will be inaugurated at Gol Park on Monday, the second at  Ultadanga inside Sony World by this month-end, and the third  will come up in Forum, on Elgin Road, this February. We are also planning four Unplugged  outlets in the city, where a single gondola retails only  chartbusters and a limited catalogue range, to cater to  the immediate locality, says regional manager Dipra Jha.  MusicWorld will also launch a range of MusicWorld Exclusive  series in the New Year. The popular coffee shop chain,  which has already fired the imagination of the citys young  and young at heart, is very buoyant about Calcutta. With  five outlets (Park Street, Gurusaday Road, Westside, AJC  Bose Road and Salt Lake), Barista is a favourite haunt for  college students and office-goers alike. The chain has lined  up two more outlets in the city this year, to add to the  coffee fizz.  We are also launching the Barista-STAR  World Absolutely Everyday loyalty card. For every four coffees  one buys, we will give the fifth beverage free. Besides,  one can win mega prizes like holidays to Thailand by answering  a few simple questions, explains Sandeep Vyas, executive  vice-president of the chain. Barista will also introduce in-store  events like book-reading, art and music shows, at its outlets  this year. The anchor store in Emami Shoppers  City on Lord Sinha Road has been launching a steady stream  of unique imports like the House of Stratus Collection,  the Random House catalogue and the Hesperus Press List.  Calcutta has always evinced keen interest in any new book  release, says CEO Gautam Jatia.  The store is planning a series  of book-appreciation sessions and exhibitions, besides a  kids club and a customer-loyalty programme during the course  of the year for the informed and serious young reader.  Landmark managing director Hemu Ramaiah is keen to use schoolchildren  as reference points for launching new titles, through a  structured feedback formula, to constantly upgrade repertoire. For years now, Badri Narayan  (born 1929) has been creating paintings that tell simple  tales using the most simple of lines and colours. With their  contrasting shades, some are dark and brooding while others  look mysterious because of the untold tales they seem to  withhold. He has time and again used such figures and constructs  delineated with spontaneous lines to illustrate many texts  ranging from Hindu epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata  and folk tales as well. An autodidact, Badri Narayan has  worked in mosaic, painted ceramic tiles and done woodcuts  and engravings as well.  Badri Narayans current exhibition  at Galerie 88 goes back to the Indian miniature tradition  for inspiration. His palette has become more colourful though  not really bright, and black and the darker shades seem  to be absent altogether from all the works save a few like  Old Houses. So there is a predominance of ochres  and reds, greens and blues that overlap each other and create  a harmony that is very soothing to the eye. They have a  lyrical effect in the simple landscapes, where geometric  forms are grouped against each other. In Old Houses  there is an attempt at breaking and analysing form. But  he does not pursue that line beyond that single work. The ones in which human figures  are present have a fresh, dreamlike quality about them.  Even when he paints fruit they seem to be part of an untold  narrative. It seems to be part of a ritual. Although his  works are usually small, here he displays some which are  pretty large. Here there is no attempt at trying out chiaroscuro.  All the paintings are unidimensional, flat. He uses archetypal  figures and forms that recur in his works. There is a sense  of drama unfolding as he creates myths of his own making.  The exhibition continues till January 10. Its big time for the Rojgere  Ginni now. The popular anchor of the housewife show Paroma  Banerjee, has her first solo album release on January 8.  With 200 jingles to her credit  Arambagh, Ajanta Hawai  and the Shalimar series  and a plethora of films songs  (Mayar Bandhan, Hazaar Churasi ki Maa), Paroma had  been waiting for long to come out with the album. If I  had my way, I could have had 10 albums by now but I was  waiting for the right moment. The album contains some of  my favourite songs such as Ghore Pherar Gaan which  is also the title of the album. Other songs are composed  by my husband Debojyoti Mishra, Chandrabindoos Anindya  Chatterjee and the late Gautam Chattopadhyay, says Paroma,  in between rehearsals for the release at Kala Mandir. Earlier,  she had won the best music director award (alongwith Debojyoti)  for Rituparno Ghoshs Dahan. The new album to be  produced by Prime Music contains eight numbers. The other  event of the evening will be a performance by Indranil Sen,along  with his cassette release.  She learns Bharatanatyam, Flamenco,  Hindusthani classical and Broadway music. But Mahira Kakkars  first love is the stage, and western plays are her forte.  Now, as a third-year student of Julliard theatre school  in New York, she has the chance to perform in front of an  international audience. The ex-student of Modern High and  La Martiniere also writes for the school paper in New York.  Its a hard life. Im up at 6 am and dont get to bed till  about 2 am, but the experience is wonderful, the 25-year-old  smiles.  Back home in Calcutta for the  holidays, she performed a one-woman, one-act play, Moonshot  Tape, by American playwright Lanford Wilson, under the aegis  of Spandan. The theatre community in Calcutta is very strong  and theatregoers here are knowledgeable. Unfortunately though,  the younger generation is not that involved, the English  graduate from Jadavpur University observes. Mahira ventured on stage at a  very young age, and loved it from the first moment. But  I wasnt always so sure about pursuing it as a career. I  thought about law for a while, but then I decided to follow  my heart. I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to  work with some very good directors, like Phyllis Basu and  Zarine Chaudhuri. I still get nervous before every performance  though, she laughs. But its the adrenaline rush that  matters. If I ever get used to it, then I know its time  for me to quit. Universal themes with a human  connection are her passion. The girl from Tollygunge, however,  will not turn down offers from Tollywood, if they should  come her way. I have worked in short films for private  channels and the SRFTI, and I quite liked it. Although I  love theatre, anything that pays the bill after I graduate  is good, Mahira adds.

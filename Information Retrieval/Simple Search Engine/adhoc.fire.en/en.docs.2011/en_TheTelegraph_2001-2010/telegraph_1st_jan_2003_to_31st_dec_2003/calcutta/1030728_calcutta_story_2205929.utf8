	Students seeking entry to under-graduate courses are facing  a lot of problems while collecting admission forms. Despite  the heavy showers, they have to wait in long queues through  the day. The college authorities can consider distributing  forms though a few nationalised banks.

	The traffic police must take steps to reduce the chaos  at the MG Road-Strand Road intersection, below the Brabourne  Road flyover. Due to the absence of any traffic signals,  vehicles have to wait for a long period just to get through  the crossing. More policemen should be posted and adequate  signals installed. 
	 B.L. Chandak, Salkia.

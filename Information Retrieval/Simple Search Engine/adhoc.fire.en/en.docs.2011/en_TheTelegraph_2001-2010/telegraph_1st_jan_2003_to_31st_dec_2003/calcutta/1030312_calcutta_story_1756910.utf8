 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two persons were killed and seven seriously injured in Howrah when a Trekker skidded off the road and overturned into a roadside ditch on Tuesday. 																								One of the victims, identified as Roshan Ali, 45, died on the spot. The other, still unidentified, succumbed to his injuries on the way to hospital. All the injured were admitted to Howrah State General Hospital. The driver of the Trekker and his help, however, managed to flee.																								Superintendent of police (Howrah) Rajesh Kumar said: The accident occurred on the Howrah-Jagatballavpur Road. The two who died were trapped under the vehicle. The rest of the passengers received head injuries. Preliminary investigation revealed that the Trekker was carrying passengers beyond its capacity and, as a result, spun out of control. 																								At least 15 people were in the vehicle, some of them standing on the footboard. Most of the passengers were trapped under the vehicle. They were screaming but there was nothing we could do. It was very difficult to move the Trekker without any equipment, said a local resident. We dragged all of the passengers out, he added. The local police station was informed and a contingent rushed to the spot. The injured were removed to the nearest health clinics.																								The two victims died of suffocation. The weight of the vehicle made it impossible for them to breathe, said a police officer. The condition of the injured at the Howrah hospital was stated to be stable on Tuesday evening. Traffic was disrupted in the area for an hour after the accident.

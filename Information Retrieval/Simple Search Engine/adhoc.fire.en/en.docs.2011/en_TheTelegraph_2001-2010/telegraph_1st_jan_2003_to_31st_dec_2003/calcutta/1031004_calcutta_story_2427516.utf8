Picture by Pabitra Das 																								Four, three and two  the True Spirit initiative reaches for the stars, while community pujas gear up for the final two days of fun																								it was a tough decision. But many rounds of inspection and deliberation resulted in 26 pujas being honoured out of over 100 entries received for CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja initiative.																								From the initial respondents, 79 pujas were short-listed for detailed evaluation. Judges spread out across the city to assess the various committees performance in fields including safety, access for all, attention to fire and electricity norms and social commitment.																								This was whittled down to 12 finalists, who were visited by three teams of judges on Ashtami morning, including Rupa Ganguly, Probir Roy, Suranjan Das, Subir Mitra, Shanu Lahiri, Swami Bodhasarananda, Kunal Sarkar, Bonani and Pradeep Kakkar, Dilip Sen, D.N. Majumdar, Probir Bose, Simon Parkes and representatives from The Telegraph.																								The assessment does not award organisers, but identifies those upholding the true spirit of the Pujas, committed people who are keen to undertake community development schemes. The winners will be supported in the execution of these plans.																								While Shibmandir Sarbojanin was named True Spirit Model Puja, and Lake Town Adibashibrinda and Ajeya Sanghati earned the 5-Star tag, there were many who ran them close.																								4 Tank Yubak Brinda, Dum Dum, one of the 4 Star pujas, got full marks for care for the environment. Held inside a park, the organisers covered the ground with a plastic sheet to protect the grass and soil from damage.																								Barisha Sristhi also bagged a place in the same category. The use of green materials, including terracotta, weighed in favour of the Barisha club. The puja, born out of a social welfare organisation, created a unique ambience for all visitors.																								Another 4-Star effort, Sarodiya Sammilani, Ekdalia, deserves a pat on the back for not being drowned out and sticking to its ethos in the backyard of one of Calcuttas busiest pujas  Ekdalia Evergreen. They have held on to a homely atmosphere, with everyone in the neighbourhood pitching in to distribute bhog among all who visit in the evenings.																								Ten pujas were adjudged to be 3 Star candidates  Shahid Nagar Sarbojanin, Dhakuria; Adarsha Pally, Behala; 41 Pally, Behala; Ahiritola; Maniktala Chaltabagan; Childrens Park Sarbojanin, Doctors Lane; Kalighat Milan Sangha; New Alipore Suruchi Sangha; Ultadanga Pallyshree and Basak Bagan Adibashibrinda.

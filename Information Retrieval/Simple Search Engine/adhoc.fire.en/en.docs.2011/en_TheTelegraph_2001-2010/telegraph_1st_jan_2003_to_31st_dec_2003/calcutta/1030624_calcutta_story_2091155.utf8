The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, June 24, 2003 				 25 glorious years
Nothing perhaps tastes better than the sweet taste of success and who could testify it better than the members of Calcutta Choir? Twenty-five years may not be a very long time in the annals of history, but for an organisation built from the scratch by a group of talented, dedicated and committed youths who had dreamt of doing some fruitful work in the cultural hemisphere, 25 years is a long and eventful journey indeed. Setting up an organisation is perhaps easier than running it successfully, and members of Calcutta Choir can lay claim to being cultural ambassadors of the country and enriching the cultural field with their valuable contribution. They can at last sit back comfortably on their laurels. On the occasion of Calcutta Choirs silver jubilee, a very special variety programme has been organised by its members. The tableaux of programme will be a nostalgic trip down memory lane. The choir has been instrumental in spreading the message of harmony and solidarity through traditional folk dance and music, and amalgamating them with contemporary issues and themes.

	Construction work on the JL Nehru Road flyover has already  hit the traffic flow. Now, it is posing a threat to life  and property as well. Most of the work is done with gas  cylinders but security standards are scarcely maintained.  At the Park Street-Chowringhee intersection, one often finds  workers taking the cylinders to the site by rolling them  on the road. What if the cylinders explode?

	I have noticed that the national flag unfurled atop Writers  Buildings has become discoloured over the past few months.  The authorities must replace it with a new one.  
	Prahlad Agarwala, Nadia.

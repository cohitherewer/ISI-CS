 Monday, April 07, 2003 				 Free-for-all follows eve-tease attempt
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Yet another instance of women being harassed on the streets has been added to the citys growing shame-graph. Five youths allegedly teased a teenaged girl on Saturday, passed lewd comments, followed her for a distance and even made a grab at her in Tagore Park, at the eastern end of the city.																								As the girl screamed for help, a group of youths rushed to her side, sparking a violent face-off between the perpetrators and protesters and triggering tension in the area. Officers from Tiljala thana arrived at the troublespot and defused the volatile situation. Officer-in-charge of Tiljala police station Subir Chatterjee later said six persons were arrested for rioting and eve-teasing. They were all released on bail by Sunday afternoon.																								Residents complained that the clash broke out after a girl was teased. We are probing the allegation, added Chatterjee.																								The incident occurred on Saturday evening. Trouble started when a teenaged girl was walking by a local club in Tagore Park. Five youths sitting inside the clubroom stepped out when they spotted the girl and started passing lewd remarks, a witness narrated. The girl ignored the remarks and kept walking towards the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. The youths then began to follow her and, suddenly, a couple of them grabbed her hand.																								The girl panicked and started screaming for help. A few passers-by apparently noticed what was going on but chose not to intervene. Then, luckily for the girl, her cries alerted some local youths near a bus-stop, added a witness. An altercation broke out, followed by a scuffle. The girl, meanwhile, left the spot. Ratan Giri, of Netaji Colony, suffered a head injury and had to be hospitalised, said a Tagore Park resident. As word spread and youths from various clubs in the locality joined in, a free-for-all ensued.																								Tiljala police restored order, but the situation remained tense even on Sunday. A police picket has been posted in the area.

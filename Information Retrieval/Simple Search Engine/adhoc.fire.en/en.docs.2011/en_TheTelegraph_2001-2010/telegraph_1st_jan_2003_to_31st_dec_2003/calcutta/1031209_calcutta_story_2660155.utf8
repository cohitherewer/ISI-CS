				 	MRINALINI SEN Mrinalini Sen																									She has aplenty, one for each of her friends and family, of whom there are more than a few. Its not in the name, however, but all in the game. And for this 16-year-old, there have been many  basketball, sprint, theatre, guitar, piano and more. Mrinalini has had her fun, but in all seriousness, taking part and winning laurels in school fests like Karma Yatra, the Bosco fest and Jacosynthesis.																									Is not just her favourite film, but also what Gutguti truly believes. Although the Class XI La Martiniere student learnt the piano from a young age and is now about to sit for the Royal School of Music fifth grade exam, the bass guitar is a pursuit of passion. Shes the bassist in the school band, too, and is busy learning the instrument in a strictly non-classical way.																									Is the one book she adores, and on stage, Mrinalini is known to be as daring as her favourite heroine. Never afraid to experiment, shes participated in diverse workshops and plays, from those organised by the Utpal Dutt Foundation to the British Council. Be it playing Lucille in Mollieres Loves the Best Doctor, or Pygmalions sculpture in The Changing Room  even sharing the spotlight with Konkona Sen Sharma  acting is in her blood.																									Is a motto of sorts, for the member of the school drama club, Expressions. She still takes part in the annual theatre evening, putting up original one-act plays. She even conducted a workshop for kids with some friends, and staged a play in her free time. And although tennis is a thing of the past, football is the future, since the humanities student intends to take up the sport this summer.																									Or being a writer is where her sights are set, with plans of studying law or English, but drama is not going to be sidelined. Mrinalini hopes to specialise in the subject, post-graduation. The summer holiday plans for this young lady are not entirely fun-filled. Apart from some upcoming theatre productions, also on the agenda is a website on contemporary youth literature and art.

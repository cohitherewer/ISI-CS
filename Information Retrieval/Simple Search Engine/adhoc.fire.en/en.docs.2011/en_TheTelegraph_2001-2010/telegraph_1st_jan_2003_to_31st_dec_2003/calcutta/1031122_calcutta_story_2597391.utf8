 A STAFF REPORTER																								To offer the best of both local and global, city-based International School of Business (ISB), part of the International group that runs centres of higher learning in hotel management and IT education, has tied up with Napier University Business School, Edinburgh.																								This tie-up will help students acquire degrees directly from Napier University and study there, under the guidance of globally-reputed faculty members, said Suborno Bose, chairman of the group, one of the largest private education bodies in the eastern region.																								From hotel management to core software, the group runs educational institutes in various fields and has set up an integrated campus, International Towers, in Sector V of Salt Lake. 																								We have set up the facility at a cost of over Rs 40 crore and the infrastructure can be compared with the best institutes in the country, Bose added. 																								As part of the one-year MBA programme, students will study on ISBs Salt Lake campus for the first three months and then move to Edinburgh for the next two semesters and project work.																								The arrangement has been made keeping in mind the necessity to churn out managers, who can fit both in global and local settings, said Prof Grant MacKerron, MBA director, Napier University Business School. He was in town to sign the MoU with ISB on Thursday. 																								The curriculum is also being drawn up accordingly, with a blend of theory and case studies that explain both Indian conditions and the global environment. We spoke both to the student community and the trade people before preparing the curriculum, he added. 																								Students with two years of work experience can sit for the admission test, to be conducted in 16 to 20 centres in the middle of next year, for the session starting September. The authorities want to keep the number of seats to 30 in the first year. 																								The selected students will have to pay Rs 40,000 to ISB as tuition fee for the first three months. The fees at Napier University will be  5,000 pounds. Besides, the students will have to bear airfares to and from Edinburgh and fooding and lodging expenses during their stay in the UK. But there is also the option of studying in India, for those who opt for the facility. 																								The arrangement works out cheaper for Indian students, in comparison to any other foreign MBA programmes, where the fees are no less than  9,000,explained Bose. 																								Besides placement assistance at the end of the course, the students will also get help in finding temporary assignments to take care of their fooding and lodging expenses while studying at Napier University.

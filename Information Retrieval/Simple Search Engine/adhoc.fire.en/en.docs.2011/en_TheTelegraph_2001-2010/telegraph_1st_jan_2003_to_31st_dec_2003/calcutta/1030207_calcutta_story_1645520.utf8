The Telegraph - Calcutta

				 																																									The indifference of the railway authorities towards local trains is apparent. Trains plying from Sealdah to Bongaon and Budge Budge and from Howrah to Tarakeswar are in a pitiable state. Seats and wooden panels have been removed from most compartments. Fans and lights do not function properly and seldom are the compartments washed. The walls are discoloured with soot and dust. I could feel the contrast while travelling by local trains in Mumbai and Chennai.				 																																									B.N. Bose,				 																																									Dum Dum.				 																																									There is a dearth of public lavatories in Salt Lake. The government should construct a few toilets in the township.				 																																									Biman Saha,				 																																									Lake Town.				 																																									Garbage from a vat placed at the Haji Mohammed Mohsin Square-Alimuddin Street spills over onto the road. The Corporation can shift the vat to the end of Alimuddin Street.				 																																									A.F.K. Ahmed,				 																																									Collin Lane.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Eastern Railway has lined up a Puja gift for commuters using Sealdah station every day.																								The proposed administrative building at the entrance to the Sealdah (South section) platforms is set to be commissioned within the next three months, said senior railway officials. The only roadblock to the Rs 11-crore project  the old Sealdah (South section) administrative building  will be razed within a few weeks, ensuring a free passage to the new building, they added.																								A team of senior Eastern Railway officials recently conducted a survey of the dilapidated building and set the timer on the demolition job. A new 10-metre entrance from the South section platforms to the new building will be created, announced Sealdah divisional railway manager (DRM) Dulal Chandra Mitra.																								The Rs-18 crore renovation project (including the new Rs 7-crore subway) was launched in March 2000. The subway was completed in March 2001 and construction of the new building taken up. Although the four-storeyed structure is complete, the 10-metre entrance is yet to be created. At present, more than three lakh commuters take the narrow bypass from the South section platforms to the main platform every day. 																								Offices of the station master (South section), the Government Railway Police and a software firm housed in the two-storeyed building ready to be razed will shift to the new building.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Navision Software India is in talks with Tata Consultancy Services and ITC Infotech to increase its presence in the eastern region and enter the big league of solution providers in the country. 																								The Gurgaon-headquartered company, which sells Microsofts business solution products through its channel partners, already has a presence in eastern India and has tie-ups with companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Axiom. 																								Only seven per cent of our revenues come from this region and we have set a target of taking it to around 20 per cent in the next six months, as we think there are growth opportunities here, said Yash Nagpal, managing director, Navision Software India Pvt Ltd.																								Navision India was earlier part of the Denmark-based parent outfit, which was acquired by Microsoft last year. As per the deal, the US software major will take over Navisions global operations by acquiring all its 45 outfits worldwide.																								 Nagpal, however, declined to comment on the valuation of and timeframe for Navision Indias merger with Microsoft, Its, indeed, a complex procedure and will take some time. There are certain criteria to be met and we are working towards that, said Nagpal. 																								Besides aiming to add 10 more solution centres  which customise the products to suit the needs of the end-users  the company has also set a target of over 400 per cent growth in revenues this fiscal over the previous one. 																								The market conditions are conducive for growth is what the company believes and is aggressively trying to reach more customers. Globally, the companies spend around 4 to 5 per cent of their budget on software, but its as low as one per cent here. But slowly, the attitude is changing, he added. 																								This gets reflected in Navisions client acquisition: it has roped in 25 clients in the last quarter. It offers a host of products for industries, ranging from manufacturing and retailing to mining and business process outsourcing. 																								We will be launching a unique product for lawyers next month. From bills and accounting to tracking expenses and storing data on cases, the product will be of great help to the legal community and already, some leading lawyers have signed up for it, quot; added Nagpal. And not just the legal community, the product  to be priced at a base of Rs 4 to Rs 5 lakh  will also benefit professionals like architects, consultant physicians in hospitals, who operate on a time-billing basis.

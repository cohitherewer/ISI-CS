 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 ICSE script recheck on merit alone
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Taking a hint from the spate of lawsuits filed against the state-controlled education boards, the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations has asked principals of all ICSE schools in Calcutta to allow students to apply for a recheck of their answer-scripts only after a close examination of their cases.																								According to sources, the directive has been issued in the wake of a rise in the number of applications for rechecks after the ICSE and ISC results were announced last year. The large number of cases filed by examinees against the Madhyamik and Higher Secondary boards, too, may have prompted the move, sources added. 																								The Council apprehends that several examinees, who wrote the ICSE and ISC examinations this year, may be inclined to appeal to the Council for a recheck of their scripts, taking a cue from their counterparts in the state boards.																								Please dont get carried away by the requests of students if they approach you for a recheck. Allow them to go ahead only if you detect gross inconsistencies in their marks, secretary and chief executive of the Council Francis Fanthome told a gathering of the heads of prominent English-medium Anglo-Indian schools in Calcutta recently.																								The Council has reportedly been concerned with reports of resentment among ICSE and ISC candidates who found their marks unchanged even after their answer-scripts were rechecked.																								An official of the Council claimed that the marks of the aggrieved examinees remained unchanged because of the high perfection maintained by the Council at different stages of the publication of the results.																								Sometimes, minor errors in the process cannot be avoided. But we always try our best to minimise such mistakes, said the official.																								According to the authorities, the Council, unlike many other boards, has taken every possible step to ensure that the process of publication of results is free of loopholes this year.																								The marksheets distributed to ICSE and ISC examinees bear my signature. Students must realise that my signature cannot go on an incorrect document, Fanthome asserted.																								Sources in the Council, however, expect a large number of applications from students for rechecks this year, as under the recently-introduced system, ICSE examinees will be allowed to seek rechecking of their answer-scripts in all the six subjects. Earlier, the Council allowed students to apply for a recheck in English only.

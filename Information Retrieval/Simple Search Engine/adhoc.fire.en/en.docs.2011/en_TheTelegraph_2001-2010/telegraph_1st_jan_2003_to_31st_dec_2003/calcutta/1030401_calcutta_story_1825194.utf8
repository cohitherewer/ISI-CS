 Tuesday, April 01, 2003 				 Youth held for teasing in Salt Lake
 A STAFF REPORTER																								An under-graduate, the son of a senior state government employee, was arrested in Salt Lake on Monday on the charge of teasing a teenaged girl, whom he had allegedly followed from Sodepur.																								Additional superintendent of police (Bidhannagar) Ajay Nand said the youth had tried to pull her into a taxi. The girl ran for safety and screamed for help. Fortunately, a police van was parked at a crossing. The policemen were taken by surprise when they heard the girls cries. Subsequently, they chased the boy, Nand said. Three policemen caught the youth, identified only as Guha, and brought him to Bidhannagar (North) police station. He was booked on charges of eve-teasing and outraging a womans modesty.																								Police admitted that 11 incidents of crime against women had occurred in the city and its peripheries in the past month. Guha, a resident of Ashram Palli, Sodepur, spotted the girl boarding a train and followed her into the compartment. From Ultadanga, he got into the same bus as she, and got off at Salt Lake along with her. There, he tried to pull her into a taxi. Sensing trouble, the taxi driver sped away. Freeing herself, she ran towards the police van. Guhas parents have been informed of the incident.

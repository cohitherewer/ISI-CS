				 																																									After four major rallies this year, the Brigade Parade Grounds are in a mess. While holding rallies is justifiable, one cant understand why activists litter the ground with waste. The entire Maidan area, from the race course to Red Road, is strewn with plastic bags, cups, bottles, fruit peels and paper. The open drain bordering Victoria Memorial is choked with a slush of refuse. The only bright spot is the Fountain of Joy. 				 																																									Asheesh Dabriwal,				 																																									Middleton Row.				 																																									Milk supply has become irregular in the booths of Lake Town and Bangur. Sometimes, the vans arrive as late as 7.30 in the evening.				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.

 Monday, October 20, 2003 				 Dwitiya Gandhi
																								Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Father of the Nation is regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of mankind. Dwitiya Gandhi is a play that begins with a group of college students bickering among themselves as they cannot decide on ways to enjoy themselves in a picnic they have organised. Aakash, who follows Gandhian principles settles the issue by making all agree to stage a play on Mahatma Gandhi. The play begins by exposing corruption at different levels of society and Aakash, who plays the lead role of Gandhi, objecting to these malpractices. The others, who represent the corrupt society, do not pay heed and instead try to kill him. The play ends with the youths all set to return home except Aakash, who has actually been killed. The play attempts to show how difficult it is to lead a life on the tenets laid down and followed by Gandhiji himself. It also raises the pertinent question: if someone chooses to follow the Gandhian principles in his life and dares to swim against the tide to stick to his ideals, will he be hailed as second Gandhi? This S.D.A Mirror Theatre, Orissa production is directed by Subash Chandra Pradhan. When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Purbashree, Bharatiyam Cultural Multiplex, 1B-201, Salt Lake

 Saturday, September 20, 2003 				 Pandal twins on split path
 OUR BUREAU																								The controversy over the Kasba puja twins took a decisive turn for one, on Friday, but the others position remained unclear.																								A division bench of Calcutta High Court directed police to allow Talbagan Sarbajonin Durgotsav Committee to put up its pandal on Bosepukur Road, just behind where the broken-record puja had drawn in the crowds last year. CESC and the fire department have been asked to give necessary clearances within 48 hours. The bench, however, asked the puja organisers to leave enough open space around the pandal to curb congestion.																								Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee requested Sitala Mandir to shift to a site where the crowds could be managed better. This followed a demonstration by local puja organisers in front of Kasba police station demanding that both the big pandals stay put.

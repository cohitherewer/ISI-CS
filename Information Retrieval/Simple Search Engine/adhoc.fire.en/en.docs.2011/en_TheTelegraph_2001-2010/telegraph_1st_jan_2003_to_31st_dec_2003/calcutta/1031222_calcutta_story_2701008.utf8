																								Tagores dance drama Chitrangada has attracted many a creative mind for its sheer message of love and how it finally wins over infatuation. Based on the mythological character of Chitrangada, princess of Manipur, it tells the story of a womans urge to transform herself to impress Arjun, the man she loves. Chitrangada gives up her warrior image, her valour and manly attributes to embrace a feminine grace under the blessings of Madan. Her transition from Kurupa to Surupa undoubtedly enchants Arjun. But in the end Arjun expresses the need to meet the real princess after he learns of her courage from the villagers. Chitrangada realises it is not just beauty but ones qualities that make a woman liked and loved by a man. Veteran dancer Shanti Bose and his troupe Nrityangan present the dance drama to celebrate Uday Shankars 103rd birth anniversary.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

 																											- Bangalore success spurs techies to benefit from shared knowledge DEVADEEP PUROHIT																								Competition is fine, but there is always a window for collaboration for collective improvement. Recognising the need for sharing of knowledge in a fast-changing industry, a motley group of technology professionals has set the ball rolling for the Calcutta chapter of SPIN (software process improvement network).																								Drawing inspiration from the success of the Bangalore chapter of SPIN, promoted by techies in companies like Lucent Technologies, Wipro and Infosys, local promoters are aiming to create awareness on the importance of quality in the software industry.																								All the IT companies are continuously working on their processes to effect improvement. And if they can come together at a common forum to share knowledge, which is not confidential, all of them stand to benefit from each others experience, says Amitava Banerjee of the statistical quality control and operations research wing of Indian Statistical Institute (ISI).																								With over 15,000 people in around 175 IT companies in the city and its vicinity, the gains from a successful network would be immense. And ISIs involvement in the initiative would enable the IT firms to reap the benefits by employing various statistical tools to control defects and manage projects efficiently.																								The fledgling body has already organised two meetings, one at UshaComm and the other at Cognizant Technology Solutions, and the promoters are now drawing up the agenda for the third one. Representatives from almost all major IT companies, like Skytech Solutions, TCG, CATCG, IBM, ITC Infotech, RS Software and the Tata Consultancy Services have been roped into SPIN.																								We are keen to involve the state government and will shortly approach Webel to join us, says a senior TCS official. Besides working on the logistics and reaching out to the small and medium IT companies, the promoters are also trying to thrash out a list of possible programmes that SPIN can undertake.

Initially, we will request members to organise sessions on their premises. Then, we will organise regular workshops involving experts, said the TCS official.

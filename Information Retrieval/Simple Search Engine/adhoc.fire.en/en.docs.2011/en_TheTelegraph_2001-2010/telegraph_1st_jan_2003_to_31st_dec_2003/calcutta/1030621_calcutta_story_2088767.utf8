The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, June 21, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Prince William. Neither  defeat nor victory fazes you. You are a quick learner, and  a spontaneous and efficient worker. You value your independence.  Take small holidays from time to time. You are a natural  charmer and a social hit.  Kusum Bhandari

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, April 30, 2003  M.K. Singh Deputy commissioner, traffic,  Calcutta Police								People must not be allowed to cross the road wherever they please. We have covered the central business district with zebra crossings, though there may be some areas in the suburbs which are lacking. If there is no zebra crossing at an intersection, people should choose one side to cross. As for penalties against jaywalkers, there is a provision for a spot fine in Bangalore and a special court to try them in Mumbai. Here, we have to take them to a police station and lodge a case  all for a Rs-50 fine. We do not have the manpower for this. So we are enforcing the rule selectively. An order from the government to allow us to charge spot fines will make things simpler.

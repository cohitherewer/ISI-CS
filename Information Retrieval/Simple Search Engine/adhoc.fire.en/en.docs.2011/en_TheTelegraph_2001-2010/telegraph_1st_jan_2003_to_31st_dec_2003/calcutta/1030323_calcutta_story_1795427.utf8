 A STAFF REPORTER																								A cricket bat took a life on Saturday, hours before the first ball was bowled in the games ultimate showpiece. 																								Fourteen-year-old Sushanta wanted to save his hard-earned money for celebrations on Sunday after India lifts the World Cup. But his father was bent on grabbing the cash for a few swigs more. When Sushanta refused to give in, a drunk Prashanta Hazra thrashed his cricket-crazy son to death in their Maniktala home on Friday night. His weapon: Sushantas bat.																								After the assault on his son, Prashanta left home when the boy became unconscious. Later, neighbours rushed Sushanta to RG Kar Hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.																								According to police, the Hazra family was evicted from the Beleghata canal bank recently and they shifted to a shanty near Kashi Biswanath Mancha. Sushanta took up a carpenters job in a furniture shop. He would return home every Friday with Rs 150, his weekly earning, and Hazra, a habitual drinker, would snatch the money from him.																								Prashanta returned home late on Friday in an inebriated state. His son was having dinner. Prashanta asked his son to hand him his weekly wage, but the boy agreed to part with only Rs 80. An angry Prashanta picked up a cricket bat from a corner of the room and started hitting his son. As the boy slumped to the floor, he left home, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of the detective department. He is still at large. A murder case has been started on the basis of a complaint lodged by Sushantas mother, Triloki. 																								Sushanta had planned to spend the rest of the amount on Sunday, anticipating Indias victory. He was an ardent cricket fan and had made a replica of the World Cup a week ago. The Cup had been mounted on Kashi Biswanath Mancha and Sushanta wanted to give it a better finish on Sunday, Mitra added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 06, 2003 				 Between time and eternity, Tagore
 															- French abstract composer and non-resident Bengali make music with the Bard SUDESHNA BANERJEE				 	 Patrick Portella and Gautam Mitra on the terrace of the Alliance Francaise de Calcutta office. Picture by Pabitra Das 																								Rabindranath and Einstein. Baul and cyber music. French composer and non-resident Bengali singer. The heady mix of opposites was on offer on Thursday evening. The musical extravaganza, Between Time and Eternity, organised by Alliance Francaise de Calcutta and staged at Calcutta School of Music, brought Marseilles-based composer Patrick Portellas no-melody-no-pitch-no-rhythm virtual string quartet, which weaved in Gautam Mitras baul lilt. This meeting of tradition and modernity was made more harmonious by readings of conversations between Tagore and Einstein. 																								The idea goes back to 1998, when Portella, who composes music on the computer, came to India in search of new sounds, and was floored by Mitras rendition of Jodi tor dak shuney keu, sung in true-blue baul style. I liked it so much that I went back to France and started researching on Tagore, informs Portella, a graduate of Ecole de Musique. Tagores texts are extremely popular in France  thanks to Roland Barthes  but not too many are aware of his music. He chanced across a conversation between Tagore and Einstein in 1930 at Kapun  a Berlin suburbia. I started thinking of a composition that would bring out the essence of the perceptions of the two humanists, as revealed in the conversation. Portella submitted a project to the French government, got a grant and came back to India in 2000 to meet the bauls. 																								But Tagore was then still chained with copyright formalities. I realised there would be too many bindings, he says, that would tie me down as a composer. So I decided to keep Tagore songs out of the project and use traditional baul songs instead. Though his final challenge was to perform in Tagores home city, Calcutta  as he admitted hours before taking the stage  the audience reaction, hopefully, put his fears to rest. The project will be released on a disc by the French ministry of culture later this year.

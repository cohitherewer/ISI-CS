The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, May 21, 2003  Good Morning Hello It's Wednesday, May 21, 2003				 																Industrial strike 
	Duration: 24 hours, from 6 am on Wednesday 
	Sponsor: All Left trade unions, led by Citu. Though  unions like the Congress-controlled Intuc and BJP-led BMS  are not supporting the strike, they are not directly opposing  it, either. So, the strike here is expected to take the  shape of a Bangla bandh. 
 
	Cause: To protest the anti-people economic policy  of the Central govt. 
 
	Whats off: Almost all educational institutions  will remain closed  universities, colleges and schools  have declared suspension of classes and examinations.
 
	Road transport: As most transport workers, including  drivers and conductors, are Citu-controlled, most buses,  minibuses, taxis, autos and goods vehicles should steer  clear of the streets. Vehicle owners admitted on Tuesday  that they would not be able to operate for want of drivers  and conductors. 
 
	Shops: As the strike has been called by the ruling  coalition, most shops and establishments are expected to  down shutters. 
 
	Railway: Though the authorities said they would  try to operate both local and long-distance trains, a large  section of railway employees will take part in the strike  and party supporters could block the tracks at terminal  stations. The Metro, too, could suffer the same fate. 
 
	Flights: Though Jet Airways has cancelled all its  11 flights, Air Sahara authorities said they would try to  operate flights. Indian Airlines said it would operate flights  depending on the situation at the ground level. 
 
	Government offices: Likely to be deserted. The chief  secretary, however, has issued a circular saying that the  offices will remain open for willing employees. 
 
	Whats on: Hospitals, fire brigade, milk supply,  ambulance, power supply and other emergency services, and  the high court.

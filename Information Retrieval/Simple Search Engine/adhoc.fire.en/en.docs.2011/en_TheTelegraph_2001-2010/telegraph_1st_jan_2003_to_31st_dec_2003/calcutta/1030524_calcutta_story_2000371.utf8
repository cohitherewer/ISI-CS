For many it is smooth sailing all the way, but for others, it is a rough and tumble world. Their dreams end prematurely turely and their world turns topsy-turvy when they confront harsh realities.

His sister and her husband Vinod advise Hari to forget football and take up an apprenticeship in a factory. On the other hand, the lure of a football fanatic muscleman to join his brigade is too strong. Haris dilemma ends when he decides to forsake his dream and take up the job.

This Nandikar production is directed by Rudraprasad Sengupta.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Girish Mancha

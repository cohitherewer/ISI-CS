The Telegraph - Calcutta

				 																																									Motorcyclists and car-owners parking their vehicles on footpaths is a common sight in Calcutta. When there is a traffic snarl they drive their vehicles onto the pavements, inconveniencing pedestrians. This poses dangers for elderly persons and children, by forcing them to walk on the main thoroughfare, thus courting accidents. The authorities should punish those responsible.				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.				 																																									Regarding the security concerns at Reserve Bank of India (RBI) buildings expressed in the letter Reserve cash in better care (January 8), I would like to clarify a few things. The trunks stacked with cash in front of the RBI belong to agencies like the Central and state government departments, who collect cash from RBI. Once the money is removed from the RBI premises, the officials and security personnel of these agencies are responsible for it. At RBI buildings, appropriate security arrangements are in place.				 																																									A.K. Mohanty,				 																																									Asst General Manager, RBI.

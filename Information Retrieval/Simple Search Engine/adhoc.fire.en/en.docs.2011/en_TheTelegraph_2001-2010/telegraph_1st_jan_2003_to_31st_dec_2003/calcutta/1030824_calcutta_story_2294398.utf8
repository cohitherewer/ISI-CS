 Sunday, August 24, 2003 				 Youth loses life to hijackers on highway 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								It was their weekend joyride that ended in bullet and blood.																								A 24-year-old youth was gunned down on the Kalyani Expressway near Barrackpore while riding a two-wheeler with his friend on Saturday morning . 																								The youth was shot from point-blank range when he tried to resist two gangsters who were trying to hijack his motorbike. The victim died on the spot as the bullet pierced his chest. However, no arrest has so far been made in this connection.																								According to police, the incident occurred around 11 am when Ashoke Bhar was riding down the expressway with his girlfriend Monalisa Sarkar. As the couple, residents of Narkeldanga under Ichhapur police station, reached nearby Shibdaspur, two persons in their mid-thirties intercepted them.																								As Ashoke stopped, the goons pushed him away. Realising that they were eyeing his motorcycle, he tried to fight back, said an official of Ichhapur police station.																								He pushed one of them trying to start the two-wheeler and pinned him down. The other man came forward to rescue his associate and took out his revolver. On seeing the firearm, Ashoke released the gangster and stood up. But the killer pulled trigger, Monalisa told the investigators.																								As Ashoke slumped to the ground, the miscreants sped towards Kalyani. Monalisas cries alerted local people. They rushed Ashoke to hospital where he was pronounced brought dead.																								Police said the couple had left home around 10 am to spend the day together. The culprits must be local people. We have alerted the adjoining police stations.																								The police have decided to intensify the vigil on the expressway. In July, two womenan elderly woman and her 28-year-old daughter were found lying unconscious beside the road. Later, the mother died, while the daughter is still being treated for a head injury. No arrest has been made even in a month.

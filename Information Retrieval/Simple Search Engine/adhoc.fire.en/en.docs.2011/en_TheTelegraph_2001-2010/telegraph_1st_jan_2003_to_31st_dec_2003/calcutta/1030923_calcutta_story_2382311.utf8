 Tuesday, September 23, 2003 				 Race that turns kids to rats
 Children take time off for a ball  game on their way home from school The heat is on, and there is no  turning it off. Students face crushing burdens from all  sides  school, home, peers, playing field That is why  Time to Talk asked readers to finish this open-ended statement:  We can ease the pressure on students by				 				 																															lBetween hectic schedules at school and back-to-back tutorials. a student hardly has any time to breathe. We have to live up to our parents expectations. This pressure can only diminish if parents stop expecting so much from their children, and abandon the theory that their child should be number-one. Not every child can be Einstein.				 				 																															This is a plea from a student crushed under the wheels of education. Please, for once, allow us to get away from the rat race. For even if we win the rat race, we will still remain rats, right? Neha Almal,
 Class XII, Calcutta Girls				 				 																															lStudent tension has become common. A few printed marks on a piece of paper are now all-important. So stress is taking its toll and frustrations have crept in. This has to be dealt with before it destroys us. Student counselling could make studying enjoyable, not feared. A realistic measure would be to start professional courses so a future is ensured for all. Apart from academics, stress should be laid on extra-curricular activities so kids have different avenues to invest emotions in. Pravati Maulik Gupta,
 IIIrd year, Shri Shikshayatan College				 				 																															lStudents can be compared to saplings that easily fall prey to their environment. They have to cope with knowledge of things both good and bad and often, it is difficult to handle. Parents should remember the most important thing is to be a good friend. Students should also be allowed, after a point, to make their own decisions. If they are spoon-fed all the time, they will never develop the capacity to lead their own lives. Tanmoy Ghosh,
 IInd year, Asutosh College				 				 																															lThe volume of studies has gone up considerably in recent years. Examination-oriented syllabi are also not advisable. Instead, teaching techniques could be improved to make school more lively by including an audio-visual element, hands-on-training and field study. Time management and value education classes must be incorporated to help fight academic and social pressure. Sayan Banerjee,
 City College				 				 																															lWe can ease the pressure on students by not forcing them all into believing they must be superbrains. They have to be given the freedom to enjoy what they are doing and the space to think about other aspects of life besides studies, so they can become responsible individuals. Aakash Kamal Misra,
 BCCM, Salt Lake				 				 																															lIncreasing pressures on students have deprived them of all forms of fun. They are often driven to suicide, afraid of not being up to the established mark. It is up to teachers and elders to lessen the load. More games and extra-curricular activities could help. Class tests can be taken frequently so students are better prepared. They should be taught ways to cope with pressure and exam phobia should also be addressed. Sharmistha Dan,
 Class XII, Shri Shikshayatan School Think square				 				 																															It is more than an average puzzle. The Kaleidoscope Classic, a thinking game, has been launched in India before taking on the rest of the world.				 				 																															The teaser that offers a never-ending number of challenges has 18 red, black, blue and yellow pieces. Developed by Australia-based mathematician and psychologist Mark T. Wood, the products manufacturing rights are held by an Indian company working out of Noida. One of the three patent-holders of the puzzle, billed to be the challenge that everyone can solve but no one can conquer, is Calcutta boy Vishal Mehrotra. In three months Kaleidoscope has sold over 5,000 pieces. The first of the Dr Wood games  all based on squares  will now move to global markets as well.				 				 																															There are over 20 billion possible patterns that can be made with the 18 pieces. If a NASA computer was to solve one puzzle a minute, it would take hundreds of years to finish them all, smiles Ratan Khanna, vice-president, marketing, Dr Wood Marketing Ltd. The company hopes the game will catch on in schools as a teaching aid. A Kaleidoscope competition is to be held soon at Barista, Delhi, followed shortly by one in Calcutta.

 An evening for peace
 What is Peace? Is it war? No. Is it strife? No. Is it lovely and gentle and beautiful, and pleasant, and joyful?....  Charles DickensIn a strife-torn world where the clouds of nuclear weapons, chemical and biological war loom large and genocide and mass killings seem to be the order of the day, we are not very far from the day when the word peace will cease to exist from our vocabulary. Shibaranjani, in association with Open Doors, presents a novel programme of painting and Indian classical dance dedicated to peace and harmony. Artists Jogen Chowdhury, Suvaprasanna Bhattacharya, Samir Aich and Dipali Bhattacharya will unleash their creativity as three dancers, Indira Bergeon of France (in Bharata Natyam), Dipanwita Roy and Priyadarshini Roy (in Odissi) will perform. Dipankar Mukherjee will chant Sanskrit hymns.When: Today at 6.30 pmWhere: Gorky Sadan  Copyright

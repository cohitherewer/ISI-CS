  Overdose: Chemists should not force  more on buyers than they want. Apropos the report Court asks  for test report on water published in Metro on August  2, it is really distressing to note that the court has directed  the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) to take samples  of water from different parts of the city and submit the  test report to the court immediately.  It is an acknowledged fact that the deterioration in the quality of water supplied by the CMC has resulted in various types of water-borne diseases. However, it is pertinent to point out that the blame for these unfortunate episodes sometimes lie squarely on the consumers as the water reservoirs are not regularly cleaned, resulting in contamination of the water.  The contention of the CMC lawyer that the careless attitude of a section of consumers for maintenance of reservoirs normally results in water contamination has some elements of truth in it. It is high time that institutions, offices as well as domestic consumers regularly clean their reservoirs in order to safeguard their interests.  Rabindranath Kar,
 Shankar Ghosh Lane.  The report Hospital head forced to buy overdose (Metro, August 4) reveals a grim truth. Very often shops compel customers to buy an entire strip of medicine when doctors prescribe just a small dose. The practice is a sort of extortion and also encourages continuation of the drug even after the doctor recommends a stoppage. The drug controller should take stern action against this malpractice.  Govinda Bakshi, 
 Budge Budge.  Apropos the article Short-route state buses to rein in autos in Metro (August 1), what transport minister Subhas Chakraborty always keeps vague is the time period by which a project is to be completed. He should periodically brief citizens about his departments achievements in each quarter and plans for the next quarter.  S. Basu,
 Address not given.  Congratulations to Presidency jail superintendent S. Hussain for turning down a request by film-maker Mani Ratnam to shoot on the jail premises (Jail shoots down Bachchan shoot, Metro, July 28). How could Ratnam think that he could get permission to take his crew into the jail, which lodges several high-risk prisoners like Aftab Ansari? The bold decision of the authorities, for the sake of security, was praiseworthy.  Mohan Lal Sarkar, 
 Budge Budge.  With reference to the report Liquor cheer to fill coffers (Metro, August 1), on the state excise department contemplating the issuance of licence for foreign liquor off-shops to mop up revenue, I suggest that all restrictions on import of rectified spirit from other states for the portable alcohol sector be removed to give liberty to dealers/ bottlers to source their input material from distilleries of their choice. The provisions for movement of industrial alcohol must accordingly be relaxed. This will increase state excise revenue manifold.  Hemant Kumar Chaudhry,
 Little Russel Street.  The observation that Some middle-ranking colleges, such as Goenka and Asutosh College... in the story District queue at reputed city colleges (Metro, July 25) is unfortunate. Goenka is the best college in Calcutta offering education in the commerce stream.  Tapan Pal,
 Batanagar.  Apropos the report Varanasi Package (Metro, August 30), the date of commencement of the special package tour by an additional sleeper class coach being attached to Amritsar Mail (3005 Up) leaving Howrah has been wrongly stated as September 1, instead of October 1. The coach will return by Amritsar Mail (3006 Down) leaving Varanasi on October 6 instead of September 6, as mentioned in the report.  S. Majumdar,
 Chief Public Relations Officer,
 Eastern Railway. It is unfortunate that political parties are indulging in forceful obstruction of traffic during peak hours to attract attention (Two hours of standstill till noon, Metro, August 2).  Debaprasad Mukherjee, 
 Nayapatty Road.

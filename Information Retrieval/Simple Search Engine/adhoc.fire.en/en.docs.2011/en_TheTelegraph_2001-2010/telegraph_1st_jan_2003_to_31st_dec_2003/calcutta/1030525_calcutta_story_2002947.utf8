 A STAFF REPORTER																								Truant students of Calcutta University have a tough time ahead. Bunking off classes is likely to be less fun and managing official permission to write the undergraduate examinations by presenting fake medical certificates less easy.																								The university authorities have, for the first time, refused permission to more than 100 examinees to write the BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinations this year. All of them have been found to have attended less than 60 per cent of the total classes held in a year. They have, however, cited medical grounds to wriggle out of the attendance problem.																								We are determined to make the students realise that they will have to attend at least the minimum number of classes. Or else, they will not be allowed to sit for the universitys under-graduate exams even if they produce medical certificates, said varsity pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das.																								Several colleges were found to have allowed students with low attendance to appear for the undergraduate exams after they produced medical certificates, Das added. The CU authorities decided to take a strong stand against this trend in the wake of the governments move to ensure better academic standard in the states colleges and universities. University officials feel this will also help curb private tuitions. 																								A recent incident in a CU-affiliated girls college was a vital reason that prompted the authorities to initiate stringent measures. The management of the college concerned had permitted a student short of the required 60 per cent attendance to appear for an examination after charging a fine of Rs 500. 																								The university has set up an inquiry committee to probe the incident. We will take appropriate action against the college authorities once the committee hands in its report, said an official in the undergraduate council where the matter had come up for discussion.																								CU will conduct surprise inspection at its colleges to check if students were attending classes. Action will be taken if too many students are found bunking off a particular class.																								nWoman murdered: Asha Ghosh, 28, was allegedly burnt to death by her in-laws at Sonarpur on Saturday. Her husband, father-in-law and sister-in-law have been arrested.

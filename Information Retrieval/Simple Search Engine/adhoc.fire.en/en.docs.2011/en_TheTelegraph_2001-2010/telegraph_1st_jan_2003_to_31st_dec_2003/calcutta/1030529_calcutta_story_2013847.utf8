 Thursday, May 29, 2003 				 Cash cue in mystery death
 OUR BUREAU																								Suicide or homicide? The vital question remained unanswered two days after Saurabh Sil, 26, was found dead in the operating theatre where he used to work as a technician.																								Saurabh, son of Lansdowne Nursing Home general manager Prafulla Sil, was found dead on an operating table of the National Neurosciences Centre (NNC), on Sunday morning. Two exhausted 10-cc ampoules that, apparently, had been used to inject two different anaesthetic drugs  glycoparolate and escolin  were found near the body.																								As sleuths struggled to piece together the events leading up to the mystery death some time late on Saturday or early on Sunday, it became clear that Saurabh was part of a group that decided on the purchase of medical equipment for the institute.																								On Wednesday, investigators came to know that Saurabh had successfully worked his way into the vital ring that determined the purchase of equipment for the NNC, located above Peerless Hospital, off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.																								His colleagues said Saurabh was skilled in repairing technical faults, an officer probing the case said. But other details of his involvement in purchasing equipment and some other financial transactions are slowly emerging. This, he added, could help piece together the case, if the post-mortem hinted at foul play.																								A blow-by-blow account from his colleagues, with whom Saurabh was out till late on Saturday, did enable the sleuths to reconstruct the last few hours before his death, but there was no telling whether the boy from Batanagar had taken his own life or had been a victim of foul play.																								Nothing definite can be said till we go through the post-mortem and viscera reports, said South 24-Parganas additional superintendent of police (industrial) Rajesh Kumar Singh, adding that investigators were questioning a few NNC doctors for some leads.																								The last thing that the technician, who was due to fly off to the UK shortly to attend a training course, did on Saturday was attend the birthday bash of an NNC doctors daughter. The party was hosted by Sisir Das at a Chinese bar-cum-restaurant in Tangra, officials said, in two batches  for non-medical staff between 1 pm and 5 pm and for doctors between 6 pm and 10 pm.																								Saurabh, despite not being a doctor, attended the late-evening session. He returned to the institute with two other doctors, concluded a sleuth.

 Friday, June 20, 2003 				 Sites blamed for Board results fiasco
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The needle of suspicion for the Madhyamik 2003 results fiasco is pointing to the state government sites on which the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education had been asked to post the marks.																								This was revealed in a preliminary investigation conducted by the state government, after the Board lodged a formal complaint with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, disclaiming any responsibility for last Sundays fiasco.																								Government sources said the Board had handed over the floppy disc containing the results to officials managing the sites (www. tathyabangla.org and www. wbgov.com) at the right time. But there had been a delay in posting the results on the Net, which led to students finding it difficult to access their results.																								The inquiry is underway to determine why the web pages did not open several hours after the results were formally announced by the Board. The report is expected soon, said school education minister Kanti Biswas.																								Board president Dibyendu Bikas Hota is in talks with the site managers to find out how the system collapsed. Once the probe is complete, we will be in a position to explain to students how and why the delay occurred, said a government official.																								Thousands of examinees had suffered a traumatic Sunday  the day the Madhyamik results were formally announced  as they were unable to access the Internet to find out their results.

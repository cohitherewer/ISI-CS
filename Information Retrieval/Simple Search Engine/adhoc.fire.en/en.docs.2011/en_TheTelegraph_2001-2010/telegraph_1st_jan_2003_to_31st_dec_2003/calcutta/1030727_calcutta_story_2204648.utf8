 Sunday, July 27, 2003 				 Post office, shops burgled
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A gang of miscreants stormed a sub-post office and looted cash certificates worth lakhs of rupees at Subhasgram, in the Sonarpur police station area, on Friday night. They also raided around a dozen shops, including a few jewellery outlets, on their way back.																								Policemen investigating the case said they would interrogate the post office staff as they were not ruling out an inside hand in the dacoity. 																								The miscreants broke open the main door and the grill gates of the sub-post office, before breaking the vault where the cash certificates were kept, said postmaster Manorama Haldar. They seemed to know their way inside the post office as the rest of the office had been left untouched, said an employee.																								After the 15-minute operation, the dacoits targeted the nearby shops, which were downing shutters for the day. At gunpoint, they grabbed whatever they could lay their hands on and fled the scene without any resistance.																								The value of goods stolen has not been ascertained. We have received complaints from a dozen shopowners but they have not been able to confirm the damages, said additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, Rajesh Kumar Singh. 																								On Saturday morning, local shop-owners blocked NSC Bose Road for around two hours to protest the deteriorating law and order in the area. Traffic was disrupted for nearly three hours. Rs 2.5-lakh heist: Anup  Gupta, a 24-year-old medicine distributor, was robbed of  over Rs 2.5 lakh and other valuables, including some bank  cheques, at gunpoint in Tollygunge on Saturday. Three goons  intercepted Gupta at the doorstep of his Kabir Road house  while he was on his way to a bank.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 City students on German fair radar
 SUBHRO SAHA																								Solutions for today. Inspiration for tomorrow is the motto of Hannover Fair. And the worlds largest technology show aimed at users across the global industrial spectrum is keen to dive into the abundant high-skill talent pool that Calcutta offers in the shape of cutting-edge institutions like IIT, Kharagpur and IIM, Joka.																								We understand Calcutta has traditionally supplied some of the finest technology and management brains from this country. The Hannover Fair, which is also one of the largest job markets in the world, can provide great opportunities to the citys resourceful student population, Wolfgang Pech, managing director, Deutsche Messe AG Hannover, told Metro on Wednesday evening.																								Pech was in town for a presentation on Hannover Fair 2004 (April 19-24), which will see more than 15,000 students from the world over walking into its pavilions. This year, we will have a special programme Go for hi-tech designed to motivate the more than 6,000 exhibitors from 100 countries to attract talented students. A special event  Year of technology  will also stress on career planning, he said.																								With the green card scheme, designed primarily to source IT professionals from abroad, failing to take off the way Germany thought it would, German tech majors now see the direct route to shop for overseas brains a more viable option, maintained the fair boss. And Calcutta, with its inherent strength of academic excellence, is high on their priority radar.																								Hannover Fair 2004 will see participation from 70 Indian companies, with the narrow focus clearly identified as subcontracting, the category alone sending 40 units to the trade show. Our role is to do serious handholding for young entrepreneurs and we expect around 10 participants from West Bengal covering steel, forgings and gear boxes for the wind energy sector, said S.J. Patil, the fairs representative for India.																								German consul-general in Calcutta Erhard Zander, who saw the fair as a great venue to project investment possibilities in the state and to forge strategic partnerships, said: The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation might also participate in next years fair subject to approval from the state government. Patil added that a proposal to approach units in the Falta EPZ is also being considered by the fair organisers.																								Indo-German Chamber of Commerce Calcutta regional director B.G. Roy concurred with Pech that Germany, which saw an annual spending upwards of 10 billion Euro at its international trade fairs by exhibitors and visitors, provided an ideal launching pad for young professionals seeking a career in hi-tech.																								Pech underlined that Hannover was not an elitist trade show. Its the biggest horizontal exposition in the world, where not just the likes of Siemens, but small and medium-sized industries also find a marketing platform. The 2004 edition has also incorporated Interkama+, the process automation trade fair earlier held in Dusseldorf.

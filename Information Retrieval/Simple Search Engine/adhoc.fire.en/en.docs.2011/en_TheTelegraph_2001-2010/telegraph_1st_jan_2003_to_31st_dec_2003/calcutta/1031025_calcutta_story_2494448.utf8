The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, October 25, 2003 				 Books, toys, multi-activity stations amp; even a castle
 															- A FLOOR JUST FOR KIDS				 	 Sana Ganguly will have much more to do the next time she drops in to Emami Landmark with mother Dona																								Rifling through the pages of the latest global publishing sensation Eragon, or checking out the latest in the Molly Moon series. Playing 007 with night-vision goggles, invisible inks and walkie-talkies. Or getting busy Supermom-style with the Palau Chef range of kitchen-combos.																								Come November, the little ones can have a ball and a blast at the Emami Landmark store, doing their own thing at the sprawling 5,000 sq ft dedicated childrens section on the fourth level of Emami Market.																								The Lord Sinha Road store, which houses over 100,000 titles in its books section, including more than 30,000 childrens titles, is creating a brand new section for the kids a floor above. To be launched in the first week of November, Landmark Calcuttas childrens wing was prompted by the runaway success of a similar concept introduced at the chains Spencer Plaza store in Chennai.																								The idea of having a separate section is to give the children who come to the store a more lively ambience, since the mainstream books area has a more serious and formal feel about it. This will also provide childrens titles the necessary exposure in an uncluttered format, explains CEO Gautam Jatia. Besides books, the childrens section will also have toys, stationery, special gift wrappers, educational CD-ROMs and films on VCD.																								Laid out in bright primary colours and livened up by cartoon characters and an ornate castle, the place will also have a special play arena for the kids, plus multi-activity stations.																								To coincide with the launch, the store is organising an exhibition of childrens books in collaboration with Penguin. An inter-school quiz will also be held at Gyan Manch on November 16, and participants will get special discounts to buy books at Landmark.																								We will have dedicated childrens racks for best-sellers and new arrivals for the first time, and will give Calcutta a one-of-its-kind outlet for children, Jatia promises. 																								A special attraction for the young ones will be imported new-generation toys from leading global brands like Imperial of the US and Palau Toys of Spain.																								These will include, apart from do-it-yourself detachable vehicles of all sizes with maintenance kits, activity sets simulating domestic chores, educational toys and even tools of the spy trade  which young boys are fascinated with  from IMC, another US-based firm.																								A special outdoor play arena will be fitted with outdoor play equipment like merry-go-rounds and see-saws, with a landscaped zone to host birthday bashes. A dedicated section for return birthday gifts is also being accommodated.																								The Emami Landmark management is keen to keep up a steady stream of in-store events centred round children, from story-telling sessions to quizzes, colouring contests to face-painting competitions. An interactive book club for kids is also on anvil and the Landmark brass promises to put on the racks the latest international titles for children, fresh from the press.						 SUBHRO SAHA

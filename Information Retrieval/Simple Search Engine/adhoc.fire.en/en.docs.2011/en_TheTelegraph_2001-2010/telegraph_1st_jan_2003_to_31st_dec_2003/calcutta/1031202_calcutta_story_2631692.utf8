Picture by Amit  Datta				 				 																															Public outrage and genuine anxiety  these are just two of the emotions triggered by the recent events at state-run hospitals. Time to Talk asked readers to step into shoes of power, to decide how they could tackle this crisis, with the question, If I were the health minister of West Bengal, I would improve the condition of city hospitals by... Here are the answers:				 				 																															lI would first ensure the best of health for my friends, family and fellow ministers, because if I cant look after them how can I ensure my voters health? I would not sack negligent doctors or take action against hospital staff or corrupt officials in my ministry, because without them, who would I look after! Citizens? Nay, not till the next elections! Arihant Bhandawat,
 Don Bosco School, Liluah				 				 																															lThe spate of deaths in city hospitals has highlighted the fact that not only is the infrastructure inadequate and the staff inefficient, but these health centres are also dangerous for patients. If I were the health minister, I would penalise hospitals for refusing patients. Second, I would appoint efficient doctors. Next, I would arrange finance to improve hygiene, and start an intelligence network to monitor functioning of the centres and doctors. Sharmistha Dan,
 Class XII,
 Shri Shikshayatan School Hospitals in Bengal have been  making headlines for decades. Sharing space with dogs and  unconcerned nurses who do not bat an eyelid are common woes  for hapless patients. The stench from toilets continues  to overpower those who do not have the power to complain.  If I were the health minister, I would find out why quality  healthcare remains elusive. It probably has less to do with  funding and more to do with the attitude of the people involved.  I would try and see to it that both the district health  services department and the health department are adequately  equipped to cope with an emergency. Private investment in  healthcare needs to be encouraged. Doctors and industrialists  should be inspired to set up hospitals in rural areas. Better  control over distribution of medicines in rural hospitals  is also required. All this is easier said than done. But  the death of a Shabana or Susmita should read as a stern  reminder of the need to pull up ones socks. Ranjana Das,
 Lady Brabourne College If I were the health minister  of West Bengal, I would lay stress on managing human resources.  Government hospital staff often neglect duties. I would  listen to their problems and make sure they are solved.  I would see to it that all good work is appreciated. At  the same time, I would impose penalties on insincere employees.  I would see that the infrastructure at hospitals is proper.  I would try to minimise the gap between idea and implementation  by distributing administrative powers proportionately to  all sections of the work force. But the key lies in improving  the education system to ensure that the right principles  are instilled in the workforce. Sayan Banerjee,
 IIIrd year, City College I would improve the conditions  by taking charge of government hospitals personally. Stringent  weekly rounds would replace the lax monitoring system in  place today. Negligence must be strictly dealt with. Vinay Poddar,
 Bhawanipur College If I were the health minister  of West Bengal, I would revamp all state-run hospitals.  The Calcutta Municipal Corporation could arrange more sweepers  to clean the area in and around hospitals, so no pests can  harm patients. All the hospital staff would be asked to  spend more time with patients. Repairs and renovation would  take place promptly. Security would be tightened. The environment  should be hygienic, secure and friendly. It is never too  late to try! Neha Dokania,
 Class IX, Ashok Hall				 				 																															lTo improve conditions in hospitals, Id create a compulsory code of cleanliness, staff behaviour and number of doctors and beds for all state healthcare centres to follow. Systematic management can quickly bring about a favourable change.				 				 																															Neha Almal Lost to the system: Grieving parents of baby Shabana.

	Software stars The auditorium of South Point School was packed with parents on Sunday, waiting to cheer their children on the stage. The occasion was the prize distribution for computer-based projects. Every year, students have to sit for a two-hour computer test. Since this is the schools golden jubilee, we thought of adding a touch of novelty to replace the routine, said Mandira Mukherjee, director of Nextgen, franchisee of IT Kids, which devises the software content for the schools computer division.				 				 																															So, over eight weeks, students had busied themselves. Those from Class IV and V turned journalists, running around on reporting assignments and creating the pages of their own newspaper. At the programme, on the dais, Aritrika Majumdar and Rohan Ghatak of Class V relived the excitement that 60 of them had shared. The teams of three had shared responsibilities  one chose the stories, another collected pictures while the third went for the interview. The interview line-up included the whos who of Calcutta  mayor Subrata Mukherjee, governor Viren J. Shah, danseuse Tanushree Shankar, to name a few.				 				 																															Students of Class VI and VII had a harder job of preparing a power point presentation on the theme Everybody eats rice. A collage of the best presentations was screened at the show, which was explained to the audience by Disha Chakraborty, whose team stood second. The seniormost lot had to post a webpage. Sanjil Dutta was the spokesperson for the Class VII sites focussing on the seven wonders of the world, from the history of each monument to information necessary for a visit to the spot.				 				 																															For Class VIII, the job on hand was to market a book on the Net. A confident Probahan Chakraborty briefed the audience about why his team had chosen Satyajit Rays Professor Shonku Ekai Aksho while the others stuck to English titles. The sites gave the story summary and the all important order form.				 				 																															Marching out of the auditorium with their mothers in tow, Shambo Mukherjee and Biswajit Mondol of Class V, reporters for Newsline, declared that MS Publisher, the software they had to use to design the pages, was very easy. Shambo had also gone to interview singer Usha Uthup at her studio with his father and found aunty very sweet. 				 				 																															The Townsville Tribune, another entry, owed its name to Sagnik Ghoshs fascination for the Powerpuff Girls. Sagnik was inspired by a newspaper in the cartoon series. Every team had to select the lead story from an event that took place in the year of birth of its members. Sagniks teammate Sarthak Ghosh who chose Pakistans World Cup triumph in 1992 as the papers lead news, was so taken with the experience that he has made up his mind to become a reporter. The teams third member, Souradeep Ghosh, after reporting on Indo-US relations, was not so sure, though.				 				 																															After the function, the crowd thronged the adjoining hall to check out an exhibition featuring the students achievements. The students, though, were busy comparing the prizes they had just collected. 
	Common class SAAYA (Socially Aware amp; Active Youth Association) and VERS (Vikramshila Education Research Society) brought together some of the brightest minds from some of the best schools in Calcutta, on Saturday, to lock horns over Common School System, the only solution to remove social inequalities at a packed Birla Academy auditorium.				 				 																															Twelve participants from Calcutta International School (CIS), Don Bosco, St Xaviers, National High School, Loreto Sealdah and St Josephs lifted the debate to new heights by expressing their views with verve and eloquence. Brother Brendan McCarthaigh and professor Prasanta Roy were the judges, while journalist Utpal Chatterjee was the moderator.				 				 																															In this battle of wits, the girls from CIS stole the show. They were adjudged the best team and speaking against the motion, Aishwarya Padmanabhan of CIS was chosen the best speaker. Don Bosco finished a close second. In the discussion that followed, the panellists expressed their views emphatically. Brother Brendan criticised the lack of creativity in education and Prasanta Roy argued that the system of equality has been preached in communist countries like Russia resulting in a complete collapse and thus should not be emulated in India. Shubhra Chatterjee of VERS spoke up for the Common School System.				 				 																															 Aritro Ganguly 
	Ready to stage A Harold Pinter production is hitting the city stage soon. Betrayal will be enacted by four young actors at Gyan Manch on December 6. Director Vivek Bothra, a recent graduate from St Xaviers College, also stars in the play alongside Tathagata Choudhury of Theatrecian, Rajashri Basu, a student of St Xaviers, and Laura Mishra, with a role in the high-profile show for Sahara now being shot in the city, Saheb Biwi aur Ghulam.

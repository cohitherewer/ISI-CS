The Telegraph - Calcutta : Calcutta
		 Tuesday, August 19, 2003  Star Spot
Sayantoni Palchoudhuri 																									But not by nature. While the 18-year-olds claim to fame was getting to the semi-finals of the rowing championship at the National Games last year, her proudest moment was meeting hockey wizard Dhanraj Pillay and athletes Anju and Bobby George, while staying in the same Games village at Hyderabad. Rowing is the strong point of this sporty spice.																									Was what made her take up the oars four years ago. From being the weakest of them all (in her first Nationals in Cuttack, she rowed in last), this tiger reporter for The Telegraph in Schools (TTIS) is now a name in her own right in the sporting arena. In the sprint Nationals in her hometown last year she lapped up silver, while in the sprint Nationals at Pune this June, she grabbed gold.																									Is not how she rows. Fast and furious is more her style. Be it winning medals for her former school, Modern High, at school regattas, for her rowing club, Lake Club, or shining for her state, shes worked her way well against the tide.																									Is how this Class XII student of Apeejay School describes her academic status. Despite a clash with her sporting activities, including basketball and athletics, Shy managed a first division in her Class X exams. Now, shes struck the right balance, aiming to be a child and sports psychologist. The destination is Australia and the driver is a sports scholarship.																									To set and reach her own goals is the bathroom singers motto. Taking her singing out of the shower, this Jimi Hendrix freak signed up for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, camping, rowing, singing and painting her way to the silver level. A regular she is at school fests, but this animal lover is never too busy to keep pace with the street dogs near her home.																									Shy must, for personal satisfaction and as a tribute to her coaches, whove pushed her into the deep waters and seen her sail through.

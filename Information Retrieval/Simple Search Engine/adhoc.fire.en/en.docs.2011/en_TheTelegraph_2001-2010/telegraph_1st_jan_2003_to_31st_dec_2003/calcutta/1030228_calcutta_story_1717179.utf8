The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, February 28, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Calcuttans have become used to a rally a day. Despite talks of private investment, the city has not changed its profile to attract businessmen. Processions of various political hues cripple traffic and disrupt our schedule almost everyday, while the government remains a mute spectator. Pedestrians are roughed up by activists, while policemen turn a blind eye. Last week, I saw three people being assaulted for trying to cross S.N. Banerjee Road when a procession was moving along. 				 																																									A.F.K. Ahmed,				 																																									Rabindra Sarani.				 																																									Trees were recently felled on Judges Court Road where a new multi-storeyed building has come up. The ground floor, meant for car parking, has been converted into a restaurant by chopping the trees. As this place is rented out to marriage parties, loud music continues till late in the night. The authorities concerned should take necessary measures.				 																																									Jayasri Mitra,				 																																									Padatik.

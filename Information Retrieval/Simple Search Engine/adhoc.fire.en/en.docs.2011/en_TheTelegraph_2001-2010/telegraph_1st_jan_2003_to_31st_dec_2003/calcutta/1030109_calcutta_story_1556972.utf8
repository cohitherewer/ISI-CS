				 																																										The hearing of the commission to solve the mystery surrounding Netaji Subhas Chandra Boses disappearance will resume on Thursday at Mahajati Sadan. The vital question facing the commission will be the death certificates from a Japanese doctor who had allegedly issued two separate certificates. The first was in 1945 and the second in 1988, sources said. In his first certificate, Dr Yoshimi had stated that he had treated a charred person admitted to his hospital at Taihaku by Japanese soldiers. The man later succumbed to his burns. He had not mentioned Netajis name in the certificate. But in his second certificate, issued in 1988, he stated that he had treated Chandra Bose (Netaji was commonly known by this name in Azad Hind Fauj) who died in his hospital, a source added. The commission has to ascertain whether the statements of the doctors were true.				 																																										The other question before the commission will be the validity of the attempt to bring the ashes (said to be Netajis) kept at Renkojee temple in Japan to India. Until it is proved that Netaji had died in the plane crash at Taihaku on August 18, 1945, what is the use of bringing the ashes to the country? asked the source who appeared before the commission.				 																																										A rubber godown in Tangra was destroyed in a fire on Tuesday night. Fire brigade sources said 10 engines fought for more than four hours to control the flames. Residents of a near-by slum escaped unhurt. 				 																																										Customs officials at Netaji Subhas International Airport handed over a passenger from Bangkok to the police on Wednesday for creating trouble. The passenger, who allegedly prevented an officer from carrying out his duties, was drunk, sources said.				 																																										Eleven persons, including seven women, were arrested at a resort in Howrah on Tuesday night. Police said the six arrested men were businessmen based in Howrah, police said. They were produced in court on Wednesday. Officers issued an order to all hoteliers in Howrah district to inform the administration about boarders staying with them. 				 																																										Police seized 7,500 litres of furnace oil and 400 litres of bitumen oil, worth more than Rs 1.5 lakh, from Jagannathpur in Dankuni on Wednesday. Eight persons were arrested in this connection. Two Matador vans which were being used for illegally transporting the oil were impounded, SDPO, Serampore, Sankhasuvra Chakraborty, said. He said police had information that tankers which transport oil to Burdwan from Budge Budge and Haldia halt at unusual places. Some people, in cahoots with the drivers and the helps of the vehicles, used to siphon out oil from the tankers, he added.

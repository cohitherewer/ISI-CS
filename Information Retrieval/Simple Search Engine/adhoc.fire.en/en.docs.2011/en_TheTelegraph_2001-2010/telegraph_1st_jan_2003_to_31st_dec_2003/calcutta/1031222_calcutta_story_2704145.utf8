		 Monday, December 22, 2003 				 Three wheels and a sneer for the law
		 STOP THAT! A police drive to rein in errant  autos at Tollygunge. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryDeepankar Pal: Auto drivers are extremely rude. At times, they cut short a trip at whim, and even force the passengers to get off at unscheduled halts. Are they beyond all control?																																																													You are right. If you encounter such a problem, please note down the vehicle number and inform me or my office. If possible, demand to see the drivers licence to verify the number. I assure you stringent measures will be taken against law-breaking automen. 																																																													 Actually, we cannot take action swiftly because our staff strength is not up to the mark. We also need to develop our infrastructure. However, in recent drives at Behala, Garia and Tollygunge, we have impounded a good number of autos that were running without valid documents.

																																																		Peter Bleach, serving a life sentence in the Purulia armsdrop case, is observing a hunger strike as a mark of silent protest against the slow pace of the process of his release. The British national has been on tea and water at Alipore Central Jail for the past week. British deputy high commissioner Andrew Hall and vice-consul John Hamilton visited Bleach on Wednesday and urged him to call off the hunger strike. But Bleach, who has not been granted remission of sentence despite repeated requests from the British government, refused to break his fast. His condition is weakening, but he seems determined not to call it off. This is the longest protest observed by Bleach and we are worried for his health, said a spokesperson for the British deputy high commission in Calcutta. Bleach is demanding equal treatment before law ever since the five Latvians were allowed to walk free despite being served identical sentences.																																																		State Electricity Regulatory Commission on Wednesday filed a petition before the division bench of Justice Samaresh Bannerjee and Justice S.P.

In Wednesdays petition, the commission informed the court that transmission and distribution loss during supply of electricity to domestic consumers was higher than that to industrial consumers.

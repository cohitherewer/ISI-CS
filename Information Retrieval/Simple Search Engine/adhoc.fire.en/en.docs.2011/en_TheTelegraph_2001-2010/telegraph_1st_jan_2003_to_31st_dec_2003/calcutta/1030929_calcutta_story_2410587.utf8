 Monday, September 29, 2003 				 Pandal check by fire squad
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Officials of the fire services department on Sunday started inspecting some of the bigger Durga puja pandals across the city to ascertain whether the organisers had complied with the rules and regulations framed by the government.																								Twenty-four fire brigade officials, split into four teams, visited the pandals under construction to check if proper safety measures had been taken. The teams, officials said, are looking at electricity connection, electrical wiring and street lighting.																								Action will be taken against organisers if the team finds that safety norms have not been properly adhered to. We have to be strict, as we cannot allow any puja organiser to endanger thousands of people visiting the pandal. But organisers will be given a chance to rectify their faults, said fire services director Baren Sen.																								According to Sen, some organisers are known to have flouted fire-safety rules pertaining to electrical wiring and construction of pandals. This, after having gained clearance from the fire services department on presentation of detailed pandal and electricity plans in accordance with the rulebook.																								Special inspection teams will be doing the rounds of the pandals till the end of the festivites. Fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee will be joining his men in doing the rounds of the pandals on Saptami, Ashtami and Navami.

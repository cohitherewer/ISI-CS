The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 08, 2003 				 																				rajat bandyopadhyay								Registrar, Jadavpur University				 				 			It is time to review the system. It is not right that only local candidates be allowed to appear for Joint Entrance Examination and not those from elsewhere. As for the quota system, a uniform policy should be followed across the country. If other states keep seats reserved for their students and only West Bengal makes the exam open, it will be unfair to our boys and girls. An open system will have its own share of problems. If candidates come here from neighbouring states, the non-residential colleges, too, will have to be prepared to provide them accommodation. Again, in the open system , there will be a higher possibility of students not taking admission even after qualifying in JEE. Colleges should be ready to tackle the problem of empty seats.

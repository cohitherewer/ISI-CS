 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Howrah-port tax fray
 OUR CORRESPONDENT																								The Howrah Municipal Corporation has written to the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), asking it to pay property-tax dues to the tune of Rs 68 lakh piled up over the past 10 years. 																								If the CPT does not pay the default, we will be left with no option but to move court, warned Howrahs newly-elected mayor Gopal Mukherjee. 																								According to the Howrah civic body, the CPT owns 1,000 bighas and some other vested property, for which it regularly paid taxes till 1992, as per an agreement signed in 1940. But the CPT stopped paying taxes as soon as the agreement expired in1993, the civic body claims. 																								Soon after, the Howrah municipal authorities slapped a notice on the CPT, asking it to renew the agreement based on the current valuation of the properties. But the CPT refused to oblige, on the pretext that it had not received any government order regarding renewal of the agreement. 																								It even claimed that the civic body had stopped sending its assessment bills since 1992.																								A sudden demand for an amount crossing Rs 2 crore was received, which the CPT turned down as absurd. 																								We challenged the claim in the high court and won an order in our favour, the CPT said. The high court asked the Howrah body to re-assess the claim. 																								Bhabani Prosad Dutta, Howrah Municipal Corporation collector, said the high court order sparked a fresh assessment of the property, the bill for which was sent to the CPT on December 4. The due date for payment is in March.																								CPT deputy chairman M.A. Bhaskarachar said the property-tax bill had been received a few days ago and was under process. The port authorities will ask for a break-up with necessary clarifications, before the tax is paid.																								Howrah mayor Gopal Mukherjee asserted, however, that the civic body was ready to sit at the talks table and forward any clarifications required, before dragging the matter to court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 03, 2003 				 Boy run over in rush to reach exam hall
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Chirag Saboo, a Class IX student of Shri Daulatram Nopany Vidyalaya in central Calcutta, was crushed to death on CIT Road by the rear wheels of a private bus on route 45A on Tuesday morning.																								The 14-year-old was trying to get off the bus when he slipped and fell off the footboard. He was run over by the same vehicle. The driver fled with the bus and could not be arrested.																								It was 6.15 am, and at that early hour, few people were around. But those who were present, immediately rushed to the boy and took him to a nursing home. 																								According to witnesses, the boy seemed to be in a hurry. He had his geography examination later in the day. 																								K.K. Singh, mathematics teacher of the school, who had just stepped off an autorickshaw, saw a small crowd and went to find out what had happened. 																								He recognised the mangled and bloody frame of Chirag and took him to the nursing home with the help of residents of the area. Chirag succumbed to his injuries within 15 minutes of reaching the nursing home.																								Sushil, Chirags father, was shocked when the news of his sons death was conveyed to him over the telephone. 																								He was my only son and it will be difficult for me to accept his death. But I am more worried at the moment for his mother, who is losing consciousness from time to time, said Sushil.

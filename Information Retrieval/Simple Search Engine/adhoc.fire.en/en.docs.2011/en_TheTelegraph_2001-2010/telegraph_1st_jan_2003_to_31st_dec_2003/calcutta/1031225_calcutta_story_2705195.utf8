The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 A dash of colour, a display of craft
 SUBHRO SAHA				 	 A girl checks out the ware at Dastkari Bazaar, Swabhumi. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Shabana fondly caresses the colourful bouquet of bead flowers she and her colleagues at Agaaz have painstakingly crafted back home in Hapur, Uttar Pradesh. For her and her all-ladies team of 60 artisans, this was the first time at the Swabhumi Dastkari Bazaar  the annual exposition in its hat-trick year. And like all the 22 groups hawking their resplendent wares at the heritage park, she hopes to sell enough to garner wages for all.																								We are grateful to Dastkar (a registered non-profit society dedicated to enhancing the economic well-being of the countrys large crafts community) for providing us a platform to display our creations. Our bead bangles and flowers have been a huge hit in Calcutta and we would love to come back next year, Shabana declares.																								So would Jeetendra Agrawal, another first-timer at the Bazaar, representing Seva Mandir, an initiative of tribal and rural women of Rajasthans Udaipur district. The organisation, registered with Dastkar for three years now, already has a presence in the city through its Sadhna brand of vegetable -dyed ladies kurtas and bandhni pomchas with a shimmer of gold and silver sold from Pantaloons outlets.																								Despite the advantage of brand recall, we couldnt achieve our sales target of Rs 1 lakh, which I guess was a touch ambitious. Still, we are overwhelmed by the enquiries and hope we get a chance to return with greater variety next year, says 33-year-old Jeetendra. Vibrant Rajasthan also showcased its embroidered and patchwork garments, juthis and black pottery at the fair.																								Dastkars primary objective is to empower the artisans to use their own inherent skills as a means of employment, income-generation and economic self-sufficiency. We mainly give them marketing support besides some designing help, and plough back the revolving capital into their business, explains Dastkar representative Prashant Das, co-ordinating the city fair.																								And the more than 50,000 skilled artisans from the 170 groups under the NGOs umbrella are thriving on this support. We sold goods worth around Rs 1.25 lakh at the first Dastkari Bazaar here two years ago. This year, we raised the bar to Rs 2 lakh and nearly met our target, smiles Mohammed Hasim, representing Berojgar Mahila Kalyan Sanstha of Bhagalpur.																								The group, which employs more than 450 women and is known for its intricate tussar weaves in natural dyes, has received a most encouraging response from Calcutta again for its high-end saris priced at Rs 3,500 each. We have been with Dastkar for the past decade and owe everything to the NGO, says Hasim who, like others at the fair, will take home 20 per cent of the sales booty for the societys weavers and handloom workers.																								We have always offered a platform to showcase the true essence of Indian craft and culture. Through the Dastkari Bazaar, we hope to give a new and direct entry to artisans to make a foray into the eastern market, says Swabhumi general manager P. Sandeep. Apart from display and sale of handloom, handicrafts, garments and jewellery, the exhibition derives an added dash of colour from Punjabi folk dances like gidha and maliya gidha.

 Saturday, July 19, 2003 					 					 It's Your Birthday So... You are enthusiastic, dynamic  and energetic. Beliefs, values and passions mean everything  to you. You are a fighter and an achiever, even on your  worst days. Peers look to you for approval. You like to  play the role of a reliable provider. Your sense of humour  is always evident.Kusum Bhandari

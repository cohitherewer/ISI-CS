																																																																																		Calcutta High Court has dismissed the petition of an advocate of the same court. In his petition, advocate Ram Chandra Prosad had challenged a trial court order which upheld Bar Council of Indias (BCI) decision to suspend him for five years.

The state Bar Council reprimanded the lawyer but did not take any penal action against him. Modi filed a petition before the Bar Council of India against the decision of the state Bar Council. The BCI, in its decision, suspended the lawyer for five years.

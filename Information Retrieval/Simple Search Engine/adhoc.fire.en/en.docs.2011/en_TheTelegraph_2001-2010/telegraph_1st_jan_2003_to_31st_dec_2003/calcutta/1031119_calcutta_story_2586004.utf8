The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, November 19, 2003  PROBHAT ROY								Film-maker																																							No. There is no question of banning shooting on the city roads. A sequence might require a specific location. The project cant take off unless the official permission comes through. There was a car-blast scene in my film Pratibaad. All I needed was an empty space. But as we were not allowed to take the shot in Calcutta, we had to travel to Chennai, multiplying the expenses. But the film unit must be responsible enough to keep in mind the convenience of common people and not to litter the roads.

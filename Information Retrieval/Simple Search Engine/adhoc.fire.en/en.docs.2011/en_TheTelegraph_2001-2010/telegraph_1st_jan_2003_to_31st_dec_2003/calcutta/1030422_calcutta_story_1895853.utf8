 Tuesday, April 22, 2003 				 Truckers lobby back on the road
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								One of the major truckers lobbies in the state  the Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Association  on Monday called off the strike on an assurance from transport minister Subhas Chakraborty that its four-point charter of demands would be considered. Elsewhere in the country, the truckers strike entered its eighth day.																								Minister Chakraborty, who held a meeting with representatives of the Federation on Monday morning, said the withdrawal of the strike by the truckers body would signal a return to normalcy in movement of goods in the next few days.																								Federation general secretary Satyajit Majumdar confirmed that the strike had been withdrawn and that trucks in Bengal would ply normally from Tuesday. He claimed that the Federation was the biggest truckers body in the state, with about 2.5 lakh vehicles.																								Officials of some other transport operators bodies and transport-booking agents, however, claimed the strike was on. The Federation is not even an affiliate body of the All India Motor Transport Congress. Their withdrawal will not make any difference, said Sanjay Upadhyay, president of the Posta Goods Transport Operators Association.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, meanwhile, said on Monday that he had written to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, requesting him to intervene and put an end to the countrywide truckers strike. He said that the state had received some stocks of sugar by rail and fish by road.

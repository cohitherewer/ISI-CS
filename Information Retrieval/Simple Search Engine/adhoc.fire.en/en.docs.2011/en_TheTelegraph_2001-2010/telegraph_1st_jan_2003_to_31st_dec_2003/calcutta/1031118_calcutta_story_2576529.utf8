																								He (the tortoise) raised his head and saw a snail plodding along on the sand...Hello, Sir Snail! Where are you racing away to? he asked, encouraging the little creature. I have to go far today, said the snail, all the way to that rock out there in the distance. Havent seen you in these parts before, he remarked...I live on the lower banks, said the tortoise, and you? Where is your home? The snail kept himself from laughing so as not to lose speed. He only smiled, then said  My home is where I am. Wherever I am.																								  The Third Race by Ashok Ahuja																								A multi-faceted talent, Ashok Ahuja trained in film direction at FTII, Pune, wrote, produced and directed two award-winning feature films, Aadharshilla and Vasundhara, in the Eighties. But not one to sit idle on his laurels, Ahuja found other modes to channelise his creativity. 51+ Imprints, Prints, Animations is his second solo exhibition that includes animation and computer prints made from original photographic images. The filmmaker has deviated from his desire to make likeness of his environment and reproduce movement, to contemplate the mundane, the everyday images that he found in photographs and other visual media. He is not trying to re-invent the wheel, but re-orient the mind. The exhibition reflects the creations of a very talented individual who seeks to find beauty and mystery in objects that we easily brush off as mundane reality. 																								When: Till November 22; 2 pm - 7.30 pm																								Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C, S.P. Mukherjee Road

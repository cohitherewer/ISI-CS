The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, November 11, 2003 				 Confluence
																								Five artists, like five rivers, creating their own spheres independently in different directions, congregate to form an estuary and then fall into the sea of creativity  that is how, perhaps, one can define the group, Confluence. Four well-known painters and a sculptor, pursuing independent professional careers with elan, have one thing in common that binds them together despite their differences in age and professional sphere  it is their urge to define and redefine the visual world around them. Arnab Basu, Ashit Paul, Dipto Narayan Chattopadhyay, Janak Jhankar-Narzary and Nabanita Javed have their own busy schedules and commitments, yet once they hear the mesmerising atavistic call of Nature, the urge to express themselves overpowers their entire being and they, like souls possessed, create in a frenzy. The current exhibition showcases their recent works. 																								When: Till November 16; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, North Gallery

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, August 22, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Dona Ganguly. You  are hard-working and dont give up till you achieve your  goals. Your maturity helps in focusing on long-term issues.  Though warm and affectionate, you can be diplomatic, if  need be. Honest and open-minded people are drawn to you.  You can strike a balance between work and leisure.   Kusum Bhandari

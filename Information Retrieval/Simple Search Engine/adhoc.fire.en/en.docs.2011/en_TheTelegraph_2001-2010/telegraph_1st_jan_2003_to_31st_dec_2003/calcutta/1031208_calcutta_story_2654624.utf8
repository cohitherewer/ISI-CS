 Monday, December 08, 2003 				 Slip road duo in airport link
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								For those approaching the airport at Dum Dum, the government has prescribed two simple bypass operations. These will rid them of their anxieties caused by the snarl-up at Ultadanga, that has to be cleared first.																								The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has decided to construct two mini flyover-cum-slip roads at the Ultadanga crossing to ease vehicular congestion at the point and facilitate faster travel between the airport and the rest of the city. 																								The two roads taking most of the airport-bound traffic to VIP Road  the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and Ultadanga Main Road  have been chosen for the operation that will help those rushing to the airport evade the traffic jam-enforced hump at one of the citys busiest intersections. The CMDA will be the implementing authority of the Rs 8-crore project.The main collaborators will be two arms of the central and state governments: the railways ministry and the transport department.																								According to the plans, the first slip road will begin from the eastern end of Arabinda Setu, a few metres ahead of Ultadanga railway station, and disgorge its traffic on VIP Road after using the Canal South Road route. 																								To facilitate its progress, an underpass will be constructed beneath the railway tracks at Ultadanga, and a bridge will come up beside the existing bridge over the Keshtopur canal.																								The second slip road is likely to be a less complicated route. It will come up along the existing mini flyover-cum-slip road that is now used to take traffic from VIP Road to the Bypass. This is a one-way affair, say officials, explaining that the new one will carry airport-bound traffic almost parallel to the old one.																								The two new slip roads (which will, literally, give the Ultadanga snarl-up the slip) will help commuters save at least 20 minutes of travelling time, say officials. Everything, from the crowds emptying themselves from the plaforms of the railway station to the market and auto-rickshaws that take up most of the carriageway to VIP Road, will be a thing of the past, CMDA director (project planning) Tushar Mitra said.																								Though the Salt Lake Bypass  connecting VIP Road with the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass through Rajarhat  will take most of the airport-bound traffic, the cars from the Bypass that are travelling to Lake Town, Bangur, Dum Dum Park, Keshtopur and Baguiati will find in the Bypass slip road an end to their Ultadanga nightmares.																								The plans for the two new mini flyover-cum-slip roads were included in the passenger dispersal system inked for the proposed Chitpur railway station project. Since there was no need to acquire land, the project would not face any legal tangles (and delays). The twin slip roads come in the wake of growing public discontent over the chaos at the Ultadanga crossing.

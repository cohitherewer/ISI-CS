 Friday, October 17, 2003 				 Rampage by cadre at police station
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A group of 500 CPM supporters went on the rampage at Rabindra Nagar police station, in Metiabruz, on Wednesday evening. The mob ransacked the room of the officer-in-charge (OC), damaging furniture. The situation spun out of control when they pulled down the thana signboard. The policemen could not react as they were outnumbered.																								Later, a large contingent of officers arrived from the Alipore headquarters and an extensive raid was carried out. We have rounded up 32 persons in this connection and the rest of the accused will also be arrested, said Deb Kumar Ganguly, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.																								According to police, the CPM cadre, allegedly led by a local MLA, came to the police station to submit a deputation demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits responsible for the murder of Fistiaque Haque, CPMs Mahestala zonal committee member. 																								Haque was gunned down by gangsters on October 2. We arrested one of the men named in the FIR. The other two are absconding, said an official of the police station.																								Initially, the mob started shouting in front of the police station. Then, it stormed into the OCs room and went on the rampage, after which it came out and tore down the signboard, said the official. After the ransack, which went on for over half an hour, the mob walked out of the police station.																								Officer-in-charge of the thana Swapan Saha said: I have nothing to say in this regard. One has to see it to believe it.																								The local CPM leadership, however, denied any involvement of their party cadre. They claimed the attack was carried out by local criminals.

				 																																										lMaya Majhi, 35, set herself on fire at her Harinath Dey Street residence in the Narkeldanga police station area, on Wednesday morning. Her four-month-old son also received burns. Both the mother and the baby were admitted to RG Kar Hospital, where the doctors declared the womans condition to be critical. The husband, Nakul Majhi, was arrested on charges of abetment to suicide, said an officer of the Narkeldanga police station. She was chided by her husband as she returned home late from a marriage on Tuesday night. As Nakul left home around 11 am, Maya locked herself in and sprinkled kerosene on herself. Her four-month-old son, who was sleeping on the bed, was also injured. On hearing Maya scream, neighbours broke open the door and hospitalised her, an officer said. 				 																																										A gazette notification was published on Wednesday by the Calcutta High Court administration declaring that the trial in the American Center attack case will be held in Presidency jail instead of the City Civil Court. The trial venue of Aftab Ansari in the Khadims abduction case , however, will not be shifted from the Alipore court, said advocate-general Balai Ray. Session judge P.L. Dutta, hearing the trial, requested the high court to change the venue for security reasons. The high court took a month to settle the issue.

Nearly 600 delegates from 40 universities across the country will attend.

Basudeo and Gopal were arrested on Lake View Road, in the Lake police station area, on Wednesday, after two gangs fought a pitched battle and hurled bombs.

 Saturday, October 18, 2003 				 Airline recipe for better food on board
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Next time you take an Indian Airlines (IA) flight, you can expect to have quality food served to you. The IA authorities of the eastern region on Friday organised an interactive session with a section of their clientele to improve the quality of food served on board.																								As part of our golden jubilee celebrations, we are here to provide customer satisfaction in one of the most enduring problems  satisfying the taste-buds of our passengers. In India, the tastes are as diverse as the country. It is one of the prime factors on our agenda to serve quality food and we invite your suggestions to improve on the standard, said MS Balkrishnan, regional director (eastern region).																								Participants included frequent fliers, corporate house clientele and representatives from the media, apart from senior officials of the airlines. Various types of meals served on board were put on display and a questionnaire was handed out to get their feedback on the quality, quantity and presentation of food served on flights.																								Frequent-flier Amardeep Singh observed that both the quality and presentation of the food needed improvement. On most occasions, I have found the food up to the mark. But on certain instances, I was served stale food. I do understand that the food is prepared hours before but steps should be taken to ensure that this does not happen. I may also add that there should be a more professional approach when the food is served. The cutlery, too, must be improved, Singh said.																								Manet Paes, general manager of Alliance Air, an IA sister concern, admitted that presentation is one area flight attendants should work on. I agree with you that food and food presentation should be accorded primary importance. As far as the quality of cutlery is concerned, we depend on items made in India and provide the best available in the domestic market. We promise to look into all the suggestions, Paes said.																								IA has also started an on-board food festival on the first day of every month since August. We are gathering feedback on this to find out the popularity of this scheme, an airline official said. If it is popular, we will continue with it.

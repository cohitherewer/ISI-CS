 A STAFF REPORTER																								The city civic authorities have undertaken a Rs 20-crore project to construct pavements on both sides of roads in the added areas of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur. Those in the city will get a pre-Puja facelift.																								Touting it as the biggest pavement-construction scheme taken up by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) since Independence, officials said about nine lakh square metres of pavements will be constructed on either side of 300 km of roads in the added areas. The project will take about 18 months.																								The CMC will fund the project from its own resources, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee. There are over 1,500 km of roads in the city and about 400 km in the added areas.																								In Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur, no thoroughfare, except Diamond Harbour Road, has a pavement, in contrast to 95 per cent roads in the city proper (wards 1 to 100). Most of the roads without footpaths in the city proper are in the Beleghata, Tangra, Tiljala and Topsia areas and on the eastern fringes of the city, which were brought under the CMC jurisdiction 18 years ago from panchayat control. 																								According to civic rules, roads in the city should have a five-ft-wide pavement on either side. The civic roads department has also started repairing the existing pavements in the city proper in the run-up to the Pujas.																								Member, mayor-in-council, roads, Anup Chatterjee, blamed the condition of the pavements of the city thoroughfares on private companies who were laying cables. Since the condition of the city roads is better than in the previous year, the CMC will lay more stress on improving the pavements this year. 																								The pavements on Chittaranjan Avenue, RN Mukherjee Road, Bentinck Street, Brabourne Road, Lenin Sarani, SN Banerjee Road, Gariahat Road, Sarat Bose Road and Ashutosh Mukherjee Road are in bad shape and require immediate repairs to ready them for the use of pandal- hoppers during the Pujas, Chatterjee pointed out.																								The Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC), currently engaged in constructing flyovers in the city, has also been asked to complete restoration of the pavements of AJC Bose Road, Gariahat Road and Lockgate Road before the Pujas. Station arrest: Six Bangladeshis  were arrested on Monday at Howrah station by the Railway  Protection Force (RPF). According to the RPF, the arrested  did not have valid documents.

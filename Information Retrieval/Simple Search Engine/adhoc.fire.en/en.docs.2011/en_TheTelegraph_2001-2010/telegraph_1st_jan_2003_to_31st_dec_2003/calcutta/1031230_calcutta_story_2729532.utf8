The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Uniform hues for green cars
 A STAFF REPORTER																								As part of its exercise to comply with the high court directive on enforcement of Bharat Stage II (BS II) emission standards for vehicles plying in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA), the government has decided to create distinctive colour schemes for BS II-enabled vehicles.																								A number of private and commercial vehicle-owners have already replaced the old engines of their vehicles with new ones and some have added emission-control devices to conform to BS norms. We have information that a large number of vehicle-owners are in the process of engine upgradation after the high court directives for the second time. We are planning to give the vehicles (buses, minibuses and trucks) a particular colour for easy identification of BS II vehicles, said H. Mohan, director of the public vehicles department (PVD).																								Apart from a distinctive colour to be painted on buses, according to the plan, a sticker provided by the PVD or regional transport offices concerned will be fixed on the BS II vehicles.																								Transport department officers said they had to choose between sky blue and green and the final decision on the colour will be made after discussions with transport operators. Vehicle-owners will have to paint their buses and minibuses at their own cost, once these are BS II-compliant. So, they must have an option. We have selected sky blue and green, keeping in mind a pollution-free environment. All BS II-compliant buses and minibuses will be of the same colour. A final decision will be announced within a fortnight, officials said. All BS-compliant buses will be painted green.																								The sticker, which cannot be faked, will be given to vehicle-owners by the PVD on production of the Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate ensuring BS II compliance. The sticker, with a hologram of shoka chakra and a computerised serial number with the live signature of the director of the PVD, will have to be fixed on the inner side of the windscreen. At the same time, it should be easily visible from outside.																								Since many owners may paint their vehicles in the colours specified without complying with the other specifications, the stickers will be of utmost importance. The transport department is trying to set up enough emission testing centres.

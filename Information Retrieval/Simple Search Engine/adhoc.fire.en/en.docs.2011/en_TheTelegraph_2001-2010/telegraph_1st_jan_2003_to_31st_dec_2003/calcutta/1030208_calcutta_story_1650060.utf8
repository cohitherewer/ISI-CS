 Saturday, February 08, 2003 				 Immersions, rallies leave city static
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A series of political processions and Saraswati puja immersions caused traffic turmoil in the city all day. Traffic had to be diverted in various directions to allow the idol-laden trucks access to the immersion ghats.																								The stretch of Kidderpore and Hastings was blocked and traffic directed up Vidyasagar Setu. Sources said the area was sealed to allow traffic to ply along a single route.																								Three political parties brought out processions to protest the US threat to Iraq. 																								The Forward Bloc started its procession from Esplanade and proceeded up Chowringhee. The procession was intercepted off Park Street, close to the American Center, police said. Crowds emerging from the Book Fair added to the chaos, and vehicular traffic stayed stalled. 																								The Revolutionary Socialist Party procession started from Mahajati Sadan and proceeded along BB Ganguly Street, causing a standstill on Central Avenue. Some 500 protesters marched in procession, shouting slogans against US policies. 																								The Jamaat-e-Ulema-e-Hind procession, which hit Kailash Bose Street from Rajabazar, had 350-odd rallyists marching down the centre of the roads, decrying the US war shadow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, April 18, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Last  month, I was to board the Howrah-Chennai Mail, leaving at  8.45 pm. Though the train pulled in at the station at the  right time, there was no sign of the man who pastes the coach  numbers and reservation charts till 8.40 pm. As a result,  there was utter confusion and chaos among passengers, till  the man popped up. But our miseries didnt end there. Throughout  the journey, vendors wriggled their way in and out of the  compartments, disturbing everyone. A few hawkers were selling  cigarettes and when I complained to an RPF constable, he just  evaded the issue. Indian Railway needs to upgrade its services  before complacently celebrating its 150th anniversary.

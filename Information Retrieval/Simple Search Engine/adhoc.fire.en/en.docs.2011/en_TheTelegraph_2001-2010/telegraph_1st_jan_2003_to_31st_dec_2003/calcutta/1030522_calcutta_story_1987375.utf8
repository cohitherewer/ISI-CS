The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, May 22, 2003 				 District stint made a must for doctors
 															- Minister Mishra cracks the whip on medical transfers and plum postings SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The days of doctors securing a plum posting at their place of choice by producing a quot;party letter quot; or on the recommendation of an Alimuddin Street heavyweight are about to end.																								Concerned at political interference, especially from the ruling party, on postings and transfers of government doctors and the reluctance of city physicians to serve in villages, the health department has formulated a new policy on the matter.																								Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said the move is aimed at decentralising the system of specialised treatment being only available in the city. Be it a medical officer of a primary health centre or a professor of the Calcutta Medical College, everyone will have to serve across the state by rotation. Moreover, the government will not, under any circumstances, hear any excuse from any doctor to wriggle out of the system. I have asked the officers to adhere to the new rules strictly, minister Mishra told Metro on Tuesday.																								The health minister has directed his departments officers to prepare a list of doctors who have been working for years in any particular medical institution.																								As per the new policy, a government doctor will be posted in any hospital located in the CMDA area only after completion of at least 16 years of service in at least two districts, covering health centres, sub-divisional hospitals and district hospitals. To get posted in any medical college, the doctor concerned is required to have 20 years experience in other hospitals.																								However, exceptions will be made for those who are engaged in higher studies or research work.																								The doctors who are engaged in teaching in a medical college will not be allowed to work for years in a particular institution. The teaching doctors will have to work at different medical colleges throughout the state after an interval of two to three years.																								We do not want all the senior and specialist doctors to be centralised at medical colleges in Calcutta. We want all medical colleges to have almost a similar strength of specialised doctors. To ensure it, all the doctors working in the city will have to rotate around different medical colleges, Mishra said.																								For example, a group of teaching doctors from Calcutta Medical College will be transferred to Burdwan Medical College, and vice versa. If the new policy is not implemented properly, penal action will follow, the minister said. He will himself decide on transfers and postings of professors of different medical colleges.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, November 07, 2003  Requiem for a lost city
 Growing up in Calcutta as a violinist  and concert-goer, Aveek Sen recalls how Western classical  music used to be an inspiring way of life here it is the nature of sound to perish  in the very instant that it is produced. That is why music  depends as much on the memory as on the ear. And that is  why the making of music is a heroic, often tragic, effort  against the gravitational pull of silence. This is how  the pianist and conductor, Daniel Barenboim, once described  the pathos of musical performance to his friend, the late  critic Edward Said. In that conversation with Said, Barenboim  also remembered visiting Calcutta and having to wake up  painfully early on hot summer mornings to rehearse with  the Calcutta Symphony Orchestra. The rehearsals started  so early because the CSOs various amateur musicians had  to go off to work afterwards in shops and other places.  Thus, fleetingly, as Said evokes the musical memories of  his childhood in Cairo and Barenboim tells him about growing  up in Jerusalem, Calcutta weaves itself into these extraordinarily  rich, cosmopolitan, but largely vanished, worlds of music-making.  Walking down Sunny Park after  a winter concert at the School of Music, I felt sad to  think that it would not occur now to a musician of Barenboims  stature to come to Calcutta. There is no symphony orchestra  in Calcutta any more that he might work with, not even a  chamber group able to put together a repertoire of any substance.  So, if someone like him did come to India at all, he would  come only to perform, and that too only in Mumbai or Delhi.  Calcutta must now keep itself happy with scraps and crumbs  from the worlds classical fare.  Having grown up in Calcutta in  the Seventies and Eighties as a violinist and concert-goer,  I remember how Western classical music used to be a live  experience of inspiration and excellence through those decades.  Histories and traditions of music-teaching and performance,  together with the talent, energy, good taste and organisational  skills of some truly remarkable people, had kept up a way  of life in a city that used to be quite naturally cosmopolitan.  From one point of view, this way of life was certainly elite   more or less innocently so. But it also had a marvellous  breadth and catholicity. From the immensely talented boys  taught to play an instrument by Father Mathieson at the  Behala Oxford Mission, and the gorkha helpers in  Moneesha Chaudhuris beautiful old flat with a baby grand  in Palace Court on Kyd Street (all of whom were veteran  members of the CSO and concert-goers), to consular personalities  and the ancient Parsi families, this way of life took in  anybody who loved making and listening to music sociably.  I remember this worlds well-spoken and urbane graciousness,  so different from snootiness or strident charity. Its members  never thought of themselves as the glitterati. One went  to a concert, and dressed up a little for it, not to glitter,  but to listen to music in like-minded company. (This was,  quite eminently, a time before Page Three, corporate sponsorship  and the cultural aspirations of five-star hotels.) In May  1972, as part of a long festival of musical events inaugurating  the new building of the Calcutta School of Music, Satyajit  Ray had given a talk, which captured the essence of this  world. He called his talk Indian and Western music  why  I cannot do without either. The printed programme of the 1972  festival is a wonderful historical document, put together  in impeccable English and with what now look like charming  period photographs from the Sixties. The range of events  gives an indication of how versatile and intellectually  serious Calcuttas interests were in the fields of music  and of the related arts. Most of the talented young people  who played in the opening students concert have distinguished  themselves in professions other than music, but perhaps  music continues to play a vital role in their lives because  of those early years  Ishanti Ghosh (she would often compose  her own music), Tanya Mayadas, Nayantara and Mohua Pal Choudhury,  Anita Mehta (she had played from a Ravel sonatine that evening)  and Arvind Santwan (playing Bach on the violin). Lolita  and Azim Lewis Mayadas  the unforgettably charismatic and  distinguished first couple of music-making in Calcutta   gave a two-piano recital, playing Stravinsky, Brahms and  Rachmaninoff. Lolita, then the principal of the school,  and her sister, Shanti Varma, put up Mozarts Magic Flute  with puppets, and Azim Lewis gave a lecture on music and  painting in the 20th century. Lolita also did a Lets Look  at the Orchestra for children. The Viccajee Family Ensemble  (Jer playing the piano, Victor the violin, Roshen the cello  and Shernavaz the flute), with Fr Mathieson as an extra  cello, played Thomas Arne, followed by recitals by the the  brilliant violinist and flautist, Joy Dutt and the Calcutta  Chorale (singing Handel, Monteverdi, Purcell and Negro  Spirituals). There were recitals by my violin teacher,  Proshanto Dutt, by Aruna Pasricha (vice-principal and a  pianist, who had also once played Beethovens Emperor  concerto with the CSO), and by the Calcutta Youth Orchestra.  Prosanto and his brother Joy, together with the meteoric  cellist from the Mission, Anup Biswas, played a Beethoven  string quartet; another well-known cellist, Beryl Burridge-Majumdar,  and Adi Gazder (the pianist and music critic) played Granville  Bantock. (The picture of The Old Gumbie Cat in Eliots Old  Possums Book of Practical Cats always reminds me of  Beryl.) There were discussions on the teaching and reviewing  of music and a production of Dylan Thomass Under Milk  Wood. In Proshanto Dutts weekly ensemble  classes (where I would play second violin), a sort of gruelling,  often terrifying, perfectionism would combine with a demanding  baroque-to-modern repertory, to maintain a skilled strings  section for larger orchestras. When Herr Nagel became the  director of Max Mueller Bhavan in the Eighties, he combined  these strings with musicians from the Oxford Mission to  make up the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra. Every Sunday, a  bus would leave from MMB with all of us, and we would have  long rehearsals at the Behala Mission, stopping for tea  and biscuits on the lawn by the large pond, with Father  Mathieson flapping about hospitably in his cassock and sandals,  speaking exactly like W.H. Auden. Those were idyllic Sundays.  Learning how to read music with one eye on the conductor,  while sitting in the middle of a complex harmony (as second  violinists do in a symphony orchestra) was a training in  alertness, simultaneity and humility which I find myself  applying in other spheres of life, even after I have stopped  playing the violin long since. In my concluding piece, I will  talk about some life-transforming music teachers and the  various traditions they embodied. Trying to weave together  these documents, memories and reflections has made me think  about history  of a city, of culture, and of individuals   in a different way. Musically, such remembrances can perhaps  only be cast in one form  in that of a requiem. (To be concluded)

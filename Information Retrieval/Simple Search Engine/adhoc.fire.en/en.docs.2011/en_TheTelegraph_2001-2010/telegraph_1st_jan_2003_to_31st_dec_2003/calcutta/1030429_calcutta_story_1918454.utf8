 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, has conveyed its nod to the English-medium schools affiliated to it in Calcutta on appointing teachers and employees on contract. At the same time, however, the Council has made it clear that stern action may be taken against the institutions if they are found exploiting any employee under the hire-and-fire policy.																								The schools will not enjoy the privilege of hiring and firing employees any longer, asserted Francis Fanthome, secretary and chief executive of the Council, addressing an assembly of principals of ICSE schools in Calcutta.																								Behind the Councils decision lies a recent Supreme Court verdict suggesting that educational boards  like the ICSE Council, which has so far functioned merely as examining and affiliating body  may be empowered with a larger say in the recruitment policies of unaided minority schools. 																								But sources said the Councils move also follows repeated complaints from teachers lobbies, citing retrenchment of employees on flimsy grounds.																								Council chief executive Fanthome explained: The schools may appoint staff on contract. But under no circumstances will they be allowed to retrench an employee before the expiry of the contract. The contract should be a binding document and once signed, its terms and conditions will have to be followed strictly by both parties  the school and the employee, Fanthome added. 																								The Council has appealed to all principals to ensure that the contract is well-equipped before any person is appointed.																								The recent Supreme Court judgment, however, also grants a larger say to the state governments in the internal affairs of minority institutions that avail of government grants. 																								The Council organised a meeting here last week with the heads of Anglo-Indian schools  those offering ICSE courses  to discuss their role, as well as that of the Council  in the wake of the apex court verdict. Going by the Supreme Court ruling, the Anglo-Indian schools that do not avail of assistance from the state will be out of government control.																								 Ismail Nehal, president, Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools, welcomed the Councils directives.																								So far, many of the ICSE schools were bound by government dictates. Once the apex court judgment is put into effect, the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations will have a major role to play in the administrative functioning of the schools. We are happy that the Council will be in a position to function as a regulatory body, as this will help the institutions maintain their traditionally high academic standards, said Nehal.

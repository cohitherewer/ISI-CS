 															- Grrowth  matches demand A STAFF REPORTER				 	 TWIN SPIN: Bengal Intelligent Park, in Salt Lakes Sector V, which houses CATS																								With chants of growth here, there and everywhere, the chips are up again in the states IT hub, Salt Lake Electronics Complex (Saltlec). And at the epicentre of the boom is CA TCG Software (CATS), which has its office, spread over 30,000 sq ft, in Bengal Intelligent Park, in Salt Lakes Sector V. 																								Responding to the needs of a growing market, the Calcutta- headquartered software and services company, with offices in Delhi, Singapore and the US, has decided to set up another development centre, Rajeev Goswami, CATS chief executive officer, announced at a press meet on Thursday. We are discussing the location of the new centre. It should take another three to six months, said Goswami.																								Besides setting up a new development centre and creating more space in its existing facility in Saltlec, the company will ramp up human resources from its present strength of 350 to 800. In less than a years time, the company has grown from 200 to 350 people. 																								Since we operate in a niche market and have specific skill requirements, we are now drawing up our expansion plans for the next three years, Goswami added. 																								The finance department officials of the company are working on the investment requirements for the new project, which will primarily be financed by internal resources. 																								CATS, a 51:49 joint venture between Computer Associates and The Chatterjee Group, has developed its expertise in security management services, infrastructure management services, information management services, product development and wireless solutions. The company reached its break-even in the second year of operation and for the past five years, its average growth rate has hovered around 70 per cent. 																								We expect to maintain this trend, as business is growing. We work on the higher end of the value chain and offer specialised services to our clients. Despite the backlash against outsourcing, the volume of business from the US hasnt suffered, CEO Goswami explained. Neither did the margins, which took a severe nosedive following the global downturn and the consequent squeeze on IT spending, he added. 																								But CATS doesnt want to depend exclusively on the US market, especially its biggest client, Computer Associates, any more. Besides exploring opportunities in the Asean region and setting up a dedicated sales force to identify new markets and clients, the company has drawn up strategies to enter the domestic market with a bang. 																								Though the challenges are huge, the opportunities in the Indian market are on the rise. We have just entered the market and expect to be a major player in IT consulting and offering end-to-end infrastructure management solutions. Besides, we are also targeting the fast-growing BPO segment to offer our technical expertise in managing and securing network, said Goswami. 																								Not just private enterprises, CATS, a CMM level 4 company, is also eyeing the government sector for business expansion. We are in talks with some of the state governments, Goswami added.

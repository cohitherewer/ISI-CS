 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 58-year-old security guard of the State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, on Netaji Subhas Road, shot himself with his service rifle on Wednesday morning. 																								He died before employees of the bank could rush him to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.																								Preliminary investigations reveal that Tarak Das, the victim, had borrowed money from a number of people. He also took a loan from money-lenders in his locality. As Das failed to resolve his financial crisis, he decided to kill himself, said an officer of Hare Street police station.																								Zulfiquar Hasan, deputy commissioner of police (central) said the suicide took place around 11.30 am. Das, a guard with a private security agency, was on duty. Suddenly, he bent over the barrel of his gun and pulled its trigger. The bullet pierced his neck, said Hasan.																								Police said none of the bank staff noticed anything wrong in his behaviour on Wednesday morning. At the time, the bank was crowded. The employees suddenly heard the shot ring out. They rushed to the gate to see Das on the floor, with blood oozing out of the wound, said a Hare Street policeman. 																								Das died on the way to hospital. The body has been sent for post-mortem.																								After questioning his family, police came to know that his financial crisis had led the man to kill himself. He had a six-member family to feed. That was why he was forced to borrow money frequently, said deputy commissioner Hasan.

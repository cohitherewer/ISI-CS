The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, August 02, 2003 					 					 It's Your Birthday So... You are a sensitive leader,  intuitive and creative, warm and caring. You have perfected  the art of weighing options before taking action. In the  face of challenge, you measure up best. You find it easy  to open up to people. You may need some time off at intervals  to connect with yourself.  Kusum Bhandari

Picture by Aranya Sen				 																																										lChief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has called for more government-private sector collaboration for creating centres of excellence in city hospitals and the rest of the state on Thursday. We are laying more emphasis on research, which can be done with the technology we are introducing in government hospitals. Preventive medicine, rather than cure, tops our plans, Bhattacharya said, while criticising private groups for not coming forward for increased government-private sector partnership. The chief minister inaugurated a neonatal unit, a molecular hepatology laboratory for research work and a plastic and micro-vascular surgery unit in association with Westbank Hospital, a private hospital in Howrah.

One of his companions riding pillion was seriously injured and was admitted to RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. In another incident, an unidentified youth was hit by a truck at Green Park, near the airport. He died on the spot, police said. 				 																																										A petition, against the shifting of one of the units of the Calcutta District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum from its present location at Bhabani Bhavan to an eight-storeyed building (which has a bar-cum-restaurant) on Lindsay Street, was admitted to Calcutta High Court on Tuesday. The petitioners have attached a report prepared by forum members, which recommended against the shift because of the unsafe surroundings with immoral activities going on at the new location. The court will hear the case next Monday.				 																																										The Budget session of the Assembly will start from March 5. Parliamentary affairs minister Prabodh Sinha said apart from the Budget, financial allocations to each government department will be placed during the session.

In a press statement, Abashesh Dan, general secretary of the committee, said although diesel price has increased by Rs 2.62, the fare has remained unchanged. He said if the state government did not form the expert committee, promised by the transport minister, and solved the problem, minibus owners will stop operations if diesel prices are increased again.

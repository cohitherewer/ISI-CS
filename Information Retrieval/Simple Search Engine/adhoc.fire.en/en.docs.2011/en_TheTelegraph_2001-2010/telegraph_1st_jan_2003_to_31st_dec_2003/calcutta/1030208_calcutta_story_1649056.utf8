 Saturday, February 08, 2003 				 A peep into an introverts world
																								Tom Roy is an artist who doesnt need any formal introduction. Those who like his works proclaim him a genius, others refer to him as controversial and a rebel artist. Roy is a man who likes to maintain his privacy. A monarch of all he surveys, he dictates his life and works according to his own terms. That is precisely the reason why despite two major successful exhibitions in the 90s, Roy suddenly withdrew from the world of art  a field he was passionately involved with since his childhood. He went into hibernation for more than a decade. After 11 years, he is back again with this exhibition before bidding adieu to his world of art. The creative urge in Roy reaches its zenith as he gets all set for his swan song. His paintings are a revelation indeed  each work is reflection of the unique streak of imagination, versatility and sensitivity of the artist that is not restrained by any formal discipline of art. Roys paintings spring from a fountainhead of spirituality and attempt to break away from the ordinary. Presented by Spandan Art Gallery in collaboration with Matrix International. 																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: Spandan Art Gallery, 87, Park Street, 1st Floor

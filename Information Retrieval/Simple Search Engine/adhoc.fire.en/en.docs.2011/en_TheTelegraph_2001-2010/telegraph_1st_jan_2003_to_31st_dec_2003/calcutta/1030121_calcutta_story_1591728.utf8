				 	SAMRAT SARKAR SAMRAT SARKAR 																									Minus-one man If that is the request, Samrat will oblige. Read on to see how names like Jatin Lalit, Shah Rukh Khan, Sukhvinder Singh, Sukhbir, Abhijeet have been witness to our mans rising star																									And the 22-year-old got the basics right by taking classical music classes from Pt. Joy Chakraborty. The lead in the school band at Don Bosco Liluah swept inter-school contests, besides performing with city bands.																									(Forget physics!) Has carried Samrats tunes far and wide. His repertoire has grown, too, now including Indipop and Bhangra, Latino to rock, reggae to golden oldies. Has travelled abroad to Dhaka and Kathmandu, besides Mumbai (at Andheri Sports Complex with Shaan and Sonu Nigam for a fashion show), Delhi and Vizag with Anamika and Sukhbir. Perfected the minus-one singing style (performing live with recorded music), has this dude, who is lead singer for a city rock band.																									For shows in Singapore and Thailand, which are coming up. For the third-year student of B.Com, the break came suddenly. Chosen as one of the singers at a tribute concert to Shah Rukh Khan in August, assignments have been flowing since then. The Xaverian sent a demo tape to Jatin-Lalit, and was even chosen as a dummy singer for a Hindi film score (one who sings when the musical arrangements are made and is later replaced by another voice).																									For years, did Samrat, as he was unsure whether he could make the grade as a performer. He may have abandoned his batting days on the cricket pitch to concentrate on music, but he was more cautious in college, even completing a CA Foundation course. But after some success, he has a small pad in Mumbai, from where he hopes to jumpstart a pro career.																									For Samrats mug on the idiot box, as he and his buddy Sayak are now working on an album of eight or nine songs, along with the videos. You may get to the Kishore Kumar fan and his dance troup  the Dynamic Dancers  working their way through the Indipop scene.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								About 2,000 answer-scripts of this years Higher Secondary (HS) examination were found in a field adjacent to a local school building in Belghoria on Thursday morning . The scripts, mostly of the political science paper, were found by two ragpickers, Safique and Rafique. 																								The scripts, according to the rules of the HS council, should be kept in safe custody, before being disposed of from the council office. Council president Jyotirmoy Mukherjee went to the spot and declared later that the papers were scrapped and the council did not need to retain them any longer. 																								A few members of Pragati Pratibha club saw the ragpickers taking away the papers and stopped them. A scrutiny revealed they were of this years HS examination. 																								Head examiner Ratan Basu, who lives in the area, could not be contacted, but his wife, Gopa, a teacher in the school, claimed the scripts had been stolen from their house on Wednesday night. Those papers were kept in the verandah, she added. She said a complaint had been lodged with Belghoria police station on Thursday morning, but officials of the thana disclaimed any knowledge of the matter.

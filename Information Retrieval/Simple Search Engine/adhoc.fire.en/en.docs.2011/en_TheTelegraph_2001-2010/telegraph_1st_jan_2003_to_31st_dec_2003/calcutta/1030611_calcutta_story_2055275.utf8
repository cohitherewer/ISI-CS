				 																																									Vendors selling chilled lime water and lassi have mushroomed in the Esplanade and Babughat areas with the rise in the mercury level. Recently, I noticed some vendors fetching water from the toilets located nearby. This is extremely unhygienic and can trigger an outbreak of diarrhoea. The civic authorities must check this.				 																																									Diptimoy Ghosh,				 																																									Salt Lake.				 																																									Commuters have to suffer an unbearable stench while walking down from Tollygunge Metro towards the rail station, along Deshapran Sashmal Road. One has to pass across heaps of litter dumped on the roadside. The public toilet nearby, filthy due to lack of maintenance, adds to our woes.				 																																									Govinda Bakshi,				 																																									Budge Budge.				 																																									Cooperative outlets, known as samavayi-kas, do not mention the items on the price list. This causes confusion among customers who buy in bulk.				 																																									Prantik Sanyal,				 																																									S.P. Mukherjee Road.

 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Wider net in fake stamp bust
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A day after a racket in the sale of fake non-judicial stamps was unearthed on the premises of the city civil and sessions court, the police on Wednesday indicated that similar rackets could exist in the other courts as well.																								Three persons  Sushil Kumar Dey, who used to run an unlicensed stationery shop on the third floor of the sessions court, and two employees, Santosh Bar and Tarun Das  were arrested in this connection in an early evening swoop on Tuesday. Over 6,000 fake revenue stamps were seized and the trio was immediately taken to the interrogation chamber.																								Sleuths then raided Deys Rajarhat residence and seized another 9,000 fake stamps, along with a stamp-copying machine, and 70 rubbers stamps, bearing the seals of the superintendent of the postal department and notary public. The fake stamps, from 25 p to Rs 20 denomination were valued at over Rs 1.5 lakh.																								A scrutiny revealed that the perforation of the stamps was not even and the gum used was of an inferior quality. The colour difference, too, was noticeable. 																								Bankshal Court granted police custody of the trio and deputy commissioner (headquarters) Harmanpreet Singh announced similar raids in other places. The district police have been alerted and are preparing to mount some more raids, it was learnt. Although Lalbazar was tightlipped on the Telgi connection, a nationwide link has not been ruled out as yet.																								Investigations are underway into how an unlicensed shop had been running on the court premises for 30 years. A lot of people could be involved in this racket. The Rajarhat house was used to store the fake stamps and imprint the seals of the notary public and postal superintendent. Once the seal was in place, a layman could never make out the difference, said a sleuth.

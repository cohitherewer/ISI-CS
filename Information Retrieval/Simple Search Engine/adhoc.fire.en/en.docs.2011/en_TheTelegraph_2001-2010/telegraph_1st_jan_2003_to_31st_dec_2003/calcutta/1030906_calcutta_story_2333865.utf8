Born in 1924, K.G. Subramanyan studied at Santiniketan under stalwarts like Nandalal Bose, Benodebehari Mukherjee and Ramkinkar Baij. The 60s also marked his emergence as a significant writer on art. Reformulating medium and genres traditionally associated with the popular arts for modernist personal expression also characterised his other major innovations to follow: the terracotta reliefs and reverse painting on glass. His works of the last few decades, in different medium, are distinguished by their remarkable diversity of themes, and a richness and flexibility of language. He is widely recognised as one of Indias major modern artists, an influential teacher, an astute writer on art and an authority on the folk, tribal and craft traditions of India. Subramanyan moved to Santiniketan as professor of painting at Kala Bhavan in 1980. He was made Professor Emeritus in 1989. He continues to live and work in Santiniketan. The Seagull Foundation for the Arts hosts an exhibition of Subramanyans recent works, Chairs to be inaugurated this evening at 6 pm. It showcases the masters deft handling of his subjects as he ventures into the mundane world of furniture, chairs to be more precise, made of wood, iron, plastic, bamboo et al with the visioners third eye breathing life into them. 																								When: September 6- 25; 2 pm - 7.30 pm																								Where: Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, 36C S.P. Mukherjee Road

 Woman for all seasons
  Sadhana Chatterjee Communist party official, womens activist, theatre personality A multifaceted personality with a colourful past. Today, despite failing health, Sadhana Chatterjee is still remembered and sought after in her circles, by the young and old. The octogenarian might not be able to leave her home in Dhakuria, but that only means others come to her.Chatterjee joined the Communist Party of India in the 1940s, inspired by the infectious zeal of a favourite cousin.

 Thursday, February 06, 2003 				 Crackdown signal for billboards
 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT																								The government will bust a nexus between politicians and policemen who are allowing illegal billboards to be put up along VIP Road and BT Road. PWD minister Amar Chowdhury said consequently, precious revenue was being lost.																								Sections of the North 24-Parganas district police were illegally issuing permits to put up billboards. Unauthorised hoardings on VIP Road, which were demolished, have come up again. In many places, the billboards encroach on the road. The companies have not taken our permission, he added.																								Chowdhury said PWD engineers have been threatened by local goons when they went to dismantle the hoardings. We have raised our rates for billboards. If illegal hoardings continue to come up, we will be forced to enact a law to stop this, he said.

 Friday, December 19, 2003 				 Health, syllabus hand in hand
 															- Year-long structured awareness initiative for schoolchildren SUBHRO SAHA																								Classroom lessons in mathematics, English or history can now go hand in hand with key health issues, like safe drinking water, healthy diet, tobacco avoidance and the need to exercise regularly, thanks to a novel awareness initiative undertaken in city schools.																								With an eye to mobilise the youth towards health promotion and advocacy, a city hospital  identified and supported by the Union health ministry and WHO  has embarked on a structured health education programme for schoolchildren.																								The Bhagirathi Neotia Woman amp; Child Care Centre has tied up with a Delhi-based NGO for the year-long agenda involving Class VII and VIII students in 20 Calcutta schools, both government and private.																								The main thrust is to provide useful health information related to lifestyle factors (diet, physical activity, environment and, most important, tobacco avoidance), essential for promoting health and preventing habit-related diseases, explains a representative of Hriday-Shan, coordinating the programme.																								Students have already shown a healthy interest. We kicked off the schedule in our school this month with the primary focus on the hazards of tobacco use, and students have been very enthusiastic. They could be the best activists to sensitise elders at home addicted to tobacco, observes Gabriel Gomes, teacher at St Xaviers School in charge of the health education programme.																								The Hriday-Shan programme  listed by WHO as best-practice model and recommended for global replication  is being adopted for the first time in schools outside Delhi. Hyderabad and Maharashtra are the other two zones targeted for 2003-2004, besides Calcutta.																								The schools are being provided with health-education material, posters, teachers training manual, booklets, classroom activity worksheets, home team booklets, resource persons for lectures, training workshops for teacher coordinators and student peer leaders. We had called the 20 principals to orient them towards the programme in September and the response was very encouraging, says the Hriday-Shan representative.																								And why not? As Arundhati Saha, coordinating the initiative at Sakhawat Memorial School for Girls, puts it, schoolchildren form the most potent pressure group and this awareness programme can go a long way in inculcating healthy habits, since the format is fun.

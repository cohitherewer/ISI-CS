		 Abhishek Basu 																									Abhisheks life, and with success, too. Dont let his petite stature fool you. At 21 years, this tabla player stands tall, having bagged the prestigious Pandit Jyan Prakash Ghosh award in 2001 and having been recognised by the Rajya Sangeet Academy in 1996, too.																									Of curls should be evidence enough that this guy calls Bikram Ghosh guru. Was born to be in the biz, making all the kitchenware he could lay his hands on his instruments of choice from the age of three. That prompted his parents to lead him towards a life of music at age eight, when they took him to see Pandit Sankar Ghosh, hoping to get him enrolled. But the busy man referred him instead to son Bikram. Shared the stage, under his teachers wing, with top pros in the business, encouraging him to concentrate on honing his skills.																									Abhishek is used to, having performed at his first professional concert at 15 and his first big show with santoor maestro Pandit Tarun Bhattacharya. He has worked on Bhattacharyas recent album, and is now planning a world tour with him. When Bikram was away for performances, our man would take his lessons from Pandit Sankar Ghosh. Now he is spreading his musical wings with mridangam lessons under Vidwan S. Sekhar.																									Across the globe, is he, with tours lined up around Europe and the US in the coming months. His commitment is unquestionable, as he is sure his future lies with his love. The ex-student of Nava Nalanda joined Asutosh College for the Higher Secondary. But after science proved too much of a strain on his musical career, he switched over to commerce and Jogesh Chandra College, and has just completed the Part II exams.																									And you will find that Abhisek wants to learn South Indian forms like the kangira and the urrukku, play with the likes of Pandit Vishwamohan Bhatt, mesmerise the crowds at the Royal Albert Hall and create a fusion album. Gives himself five years to step on to the national and global stage for classical music.

 Thursday, November 27, 2003 				 Spurned suitor gifts acid death
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 26-year-old youth, spurned by the girl he wanted to marry, made sure she would not live to marry another man. 																								The marriage proposal of Utpal Haldar, of Sukanta Palli, in the Diamond Harbour police station area, was turned down by the girls parents. On Tuesday night, he retaliated by tossing a bulbful of acid on the 18-year-old girls face.																								Aparna Haldar received severe burn injuries and was rushed to the Diamond Harbour sub-divisional hospital. As her condition worsened, she was referred to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital. Late on Wednesday, she succumbed to her burns.																								Utpal used to be Aparnas tutor. He would visit her fathers post-office quarters every day for the past couple of years. When she discontinued her studies, her father, Biswanath, asked him to tutor Aparnas younger brother. 																								In time, Utpal asked for Aparnas hand in marriage. The family agreed, but trouble began when after Aparnas mother visited Utpals house. She felt her daughter would not be able to adjust in the household, said an official of the local police station.																								So, the youth was asked to stop dreaming about marrying Aparna. His efforts to woo her back were rebuffed. On Tuesday evening, he sent Aparna a note, asking her to meet him. She obliged. As soon as rejected his request, Utpal threw the acid bulb at her, the official added.																								Utpal is absconding. We have interrogated his family but received no satisfactory answers on his whereabouts, said Mehmood Akhtar, superintendent of police, Diamond Harbour. The cops of the neighbouring areas have been alerted.

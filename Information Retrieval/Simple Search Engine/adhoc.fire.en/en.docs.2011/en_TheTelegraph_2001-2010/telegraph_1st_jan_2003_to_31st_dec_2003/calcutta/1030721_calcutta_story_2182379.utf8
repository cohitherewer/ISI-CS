The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, July 21, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	The Calcutta Municipal Corporations attempt to keep Calcutta  clean must start with the BBD Bag area, where makeshift  food-stalls have blocked the footpaths, forcing pedestrians  to walk on the road. Vendors dotting the area around Writers  Buildings turn the place into a garbage vat by the end of  the day. Fruit peel, leaves and other refuse are dumped  on the pavements. Why cant the authorities keep at least  the centre of administration clean? 
	 T.R. Anand, Budge Budge.  
	Ram Mohan Sarani in Hooghly is in very bad shape. Immediate  repairs are needed on this stretch for a mishap-free journey.  
	Savita Devi, Hooghly.

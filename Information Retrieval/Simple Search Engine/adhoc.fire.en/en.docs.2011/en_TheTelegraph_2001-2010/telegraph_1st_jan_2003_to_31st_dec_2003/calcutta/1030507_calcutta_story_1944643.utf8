The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, May 07, 2003 				 KLM back on the horizon
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A year after having suspended services from the city, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will resume its Calcutta schedule from May 7. The inaugural flight will touch down early on Wednesday and will return to Amsterdam after a two-hour wait. This will remain the regular schedule for KLMs weekly flight to and from the city.																								The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) had initiated efforts to bring KLM back to the city, and had even appealed to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who, in turn, had written to the Prime Ministers Office.																								It means greater convenience for holiday travellers. No more waiting in Mumbai and Delhi airports to catch international flights. And there is a sufficient volume of travellers, said Sanjoy Sett, chairman, TAAI, eastern region.

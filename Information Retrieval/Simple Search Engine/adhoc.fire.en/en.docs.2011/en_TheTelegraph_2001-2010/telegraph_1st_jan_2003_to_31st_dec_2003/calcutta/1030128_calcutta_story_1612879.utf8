The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, January 28, 2003 				 Cell STD rate cut
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Airtel has announced a reduced cell-to-cell national long-distance call tariff for its customers, effective January 28. 																								The reduction in rates will link around 200,000 Airtel and Magic pre-paid subscribers in the city to a one rate plan indicating the death of distance and time, said Bharti Mobitel chief executive officer Deepak Gulati.																								Sources in Bharti said the cellular provider is expected to announce a February drop in cell-to-cell international long-distance (ILD) rates by almost half.																								Unlike the selective networks to which Hutch subscri-bers can make calls, Airtel subscribers can make calls to any network in the country at the rate of Rs 2.99 per minute, beyond a distance of 50 km. 																								The rates for distances below 50 km remain Rs 1.20 per minute. Additional outgoing airtime rates will be levied according to the tariff structure of the subscriber.																								All national call traffic will ride on Bharti Telesonics IndiaOne backbone, making it possible to offer a national reach to Airtel subscribers.																								The reduction will make roaming facilities, a service exclusive to GSM customers, more affordable and help subscribers keep in touch even when they travel, added Gulati.																								From April 1, cellphone subscribers will also be able to enjoy free incoming traffic, without paying the present additional charge of Rs 49.

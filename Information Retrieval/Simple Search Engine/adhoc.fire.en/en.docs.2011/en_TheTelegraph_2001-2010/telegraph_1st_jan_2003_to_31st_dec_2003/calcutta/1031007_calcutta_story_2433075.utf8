																									GUNJAN BAIJAL																									And Gunjan will answer, but only in six months. This final-year medical student is on his way to attaching the letters MBBS after his name. His days at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital are numbered, with a few more months of the surgery internship left.																									Is what you are likely to be once Dr Greatgunns is in the business. Specialising in medicine is one of his ambitions, to keep him at the frontline of pioneering research for diseases such as cancer. After a year of housestaffship in cardiology, with exposure to critical care medicine, the boy who topped school (Assembly of God Church) in the ISC and had radiant scores in medical entrance exams, would like to pursue a postgrad in medicine or ophthalmology, later moving on to oncology. Has already shown interest in cutting edge technologies as well, hosting a seminar on cloning in college.																									Feels Gunjan, is needed to serve society best. The 24-year-old who has always ranked in the top 10 in med school wants to set up a hospital where the profits will be used to treat the needy. Can speak for his peers as well, as he demonstrated while representing students at the Association of Surgeons India Conference, Calcutta chapter.																									One may call him, though his instrument of choice is the Spanish guitar, in which he holds a junior diploma in Classical Music from Prayag Sangeet Samiti. Having learnt for around seven years, he has strummed his stuff for a few public performances.																									To the theatre of a rather different kind of operation is where Gunjan has proved his prowess. Starting with the British Council drama festival while in school, he went on to private shows under the Stagecraft and Theatrician banners. Performing came naturally in his debating career, which is strewn with victories in both Hindi and English. He has had a stint on the small screen, too, around eight years ago, in Hawa ka Rang, a serial on Doordarshan directed by Rudraprasad Sengupta. Though dancing around trees is not his cup of tea, off-beat roles are welcome.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								A fleet of 11 Hawk aircraft, belonging to the British Royal Air Forces aerobatic team Red Arrows, was refuelled at Calcuttas Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport on Sunday morning. 																								The fighter planes, flying in from Thailand, stopped at the airport for more than an hour and then left for New Delhi at around 11 am, airport officials said. 																								The aircraft, with 22 crew members, had been to Thailand to take part in an aerobatic show. Since they were flying long-distance, they had to stop at Calcutta airport for refuelling and technical checks, said J. Kongari, director, Calcutta airport. 																								The fleet was refuelled at the airport 20 days ago when it was en route to Thailand.

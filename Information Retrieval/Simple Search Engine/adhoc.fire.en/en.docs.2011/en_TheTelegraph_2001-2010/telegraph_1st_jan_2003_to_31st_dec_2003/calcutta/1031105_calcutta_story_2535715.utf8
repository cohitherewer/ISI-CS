 Wednesday, November 05, 2003 				 Doctor team vigil to save air hostess 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Even after 24 hours of constant medical attention, Rashmi Papney, the air hostess with Alliance Air, who met with an accident on Monday, is reported to be in a critical condition. An eight-member team of specialists, including neurologists and orthopaedic surgeons, has spent hours by her bed but failed to assure a recovery.																								According to Tapas Mukherjee, joint director of Ruby General Hospital, Papney has suffered multiple injuries. Nothing can be said as yet, as she is in a very serious state. She is on an artificial respiratory system. In the past 24 hours, we have infused 24 bottles of blood, including a few bottles of plasma, but we need more time to confirm whether she is responding to treatment, Mukherjee said.																								Rashmi left her New Alipore residence, where she lived as a paying guest, early on Monday to report for duty at Dum Dum airport. At around 8.30 am, on the EM Bypass, as her car took a left from the Rashbehari connector, it skidded off the road. The cause was an oilspill from a tanker that had passed that way earlier. As the car hit a lamp-post, both the driver and Rashmi sustained injuries. Local residents rushed her to hospital in an unconscious state. 																								Ruby General staff went through her papers and contacted her parents in Delhi. Late on Monday, her parents and brother, who works for a daily in Uttar Pradesh, arrived in the city and headed straight to the hospital.

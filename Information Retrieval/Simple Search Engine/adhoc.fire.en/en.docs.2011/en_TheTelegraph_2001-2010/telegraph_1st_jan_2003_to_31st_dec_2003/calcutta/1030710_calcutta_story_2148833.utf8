  Net Soft lenses dont let you look further (Metro, June 13) projected views of some leading opthalmologists of West Bengal saying that soft contact lens does not arrest increasing myopia in teenaged patients. I agree with this but the article seems to suggest that soft lenses are responsible for increasing power.Contact lenses have some advantages over spectacles. They offer a wider field of vision. Vision through spectacles is restricted within the optical frame. The myopic patient has a better vision as long as the optical centre of the cornea and the lenses is in same line but contact lens moves in all directions of gaze thus increasing the field of vision.Compared to spectacles, contact lenses dont get wet with water or steam up with perspiration. With high minus-power lenses, the visible size of the image gets reduced as there is a distance between the eye and the spectacle lenses. Myopic patients often have the tendency of pushing the spectacles closer to the eye to get clearer vision but as contact lens stays over the cornea the patient sees normal sized images.When there is a considerable difference between the eyes, different-sized images may form on the retina and a person may have difficulty in fusing them in the brain. By wearing contact lenses, this problem may be eliminated. Teenagers involved in sports will fare better with contact lenses. All this may create an effect in the eye which may restrict the rate of increase in power. It is statistically proven that the rigid contact lenses can mould corneal curvature, helping to arrest or restrict myopic growth to some extent. But I do agree that contact lens is not free from disadvantages and the soft ones, especially, may get contaminated easily. Sonjoy chaos (Madhyamik fails the tech test, Metro, June 16). When will the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education learn? This year, too, students had to suffer the agony, waiting for long hours after logging in, trying to know how they fared. More painful is the lackadaisical attitude of the board. Otherwise, they would not have risked publishing the result on a Sunday.Sunil (Metro, June 12) provided us an insight into the Debashis Som imbroglio. What a fuss! The council was dissolved on Monday, the council members put behind bars on Tuesday and then re-assigned duties on Wednesday. Doesnt this remind us of the Solomon Grundy poem we studied in our nursery classes? This whole comedy will add to the increasing unpopularity of Trinamul Congress in Bengal.Kunal Ray,
Howrah.The report Mamata rules, mayor retreats (Metro, June 11) highlights how the Corporation administration has been turned into a mockery at the hands of an egoist mayor and a whimsical party chief. The mayor spits venom today and swallows bitter pill tomorrow! It is difficult to imagine that once this honourable seat was occupied by venerable leaders like Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das and Netaji Subhas Bose. What a fall! Govinda Bakshi,
Budge It is curious to learn that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wore shirt and trousers during his recent Rome tour (Buddhas new clothes, Metro, June 13). But personally, I like the CM in dhoti-kurta. Former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri dressed in dhoti-kurta both at home and abroad. Bhattacharjee would increase the dignity of Bengali culture if he sticks to the national dress. Prahlad Agarwala,
Majdia, Nadia.  Kudos for highlighting artist Somneel Saha who shot to fame during Bill Clintons 2001 India visit when he managed to get the US Presidents portrait autographed. The article Teens brush with celebs, pen in hand (Metro, June 11) showcases his initiative and interest in drawing portraits of celebrities. Some private organisation should come forward to help Ray Choudhuri, published in Calcutta Column on July 9, was published earlier under the heading Pole in drain to avert death trap on July 7. The oversight is regretted.

 Sunday, October 12, 2003 				 Lalbazar awaits court order copy
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two days after the state government received a certified copy of Justice Amitava Lalas judgment, the city police on Saturday insisted that the court order was yet to reach them. 																								Though the state chief secretary confirmed two days ago that the state government had received a copy of the order, none of the senior officials at Lalbazar police headquarters have any idea about when they will get to see a copy of the judgment. 																								Deputy commissioner, headquarters, Kuldiep Singh  authorised to give permission to hold rallies and public meetings in the city  said on Saturday that he has not received a copy of Justice Lalas order yet. I need to go through the judgment to plan our next course of action. Right now, we dont have any idea about what the order says. For instance, we dont know whether it has banned all rallies and processions or only political ones, Singh explained.																								M.K. Singh, deputy commissioner, traffic, said: I dont know what exactly the order has said. We dont have a clear idea about what the traffic police ought to do if thousands of people start marching along the city roads.

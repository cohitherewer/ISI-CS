 Thursday, August 14, 2003 				 Counsel check for ragging 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Alarmed over reports of ragging in two engineering institutions  at Jalpaiguri, in north Bengal, and at Baranagar, in Calcutta  Jadavpur University (JU) has arranged for counselling sessions for its engineering students to warn them about the consequences of harassing freshers. 																								We have adopted a string of measures this year, in the wake of recent reports of ragging in some engineering colleges. At the counselling sessions, we explain to students how ragging can spoil their entire career, apart from the opportunity to be part of a prestigious institution, said JU registrar Rajat Banerjee.																								Sayandip Bandopadhyay, a first-year student from Calcutta, has returned home after he was beaten up and seriously injured by some senior students of Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College last week. Following an inquiry, the government expelled four students in connection with the incident. 																								Two first-year students of the Indian Statistical Institute, in Baranagar, was allegedly tortured by a group of seniors.																								JU registrar Banerjee said apart from the counselling sessions, the authorities have beefed up patrolling at the students hostels at night to stop ragging. Measures are being taken to ensure that members of the institutions anti-ragging committee maintain proper vigil on the campus. University sources said the move follows a government directive to all educational institutions to curb ragging.

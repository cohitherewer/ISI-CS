 Utsa or source is the fountain of creativity that bubbles with the elixir, inspiring and rejuvenating creative souls. It is, therefore, apt when a group of enthusiastic and trained youths, fresh out of art college, congregate to form an umbrella organisation, Utsa. That was way back in 1979. Since then, the members of Utsa have traversed diverse paths, held both solo and group shows from time to time and matured with time and experience. After a long hiatus, the group congregates once again, this time with some more new talents and puts up a multi-dimensional exhibition. This show is interesting in terms of variety both in style and form as well as medium. In this exhibition, modern abstract paintings share space with pure Indian and classical Western style works. Sculptures ranging from terracotta to various other metals are displayed prominently. On the whole, it is a miniature representation of our countrys contemporary art scenario.																								When: Till tomorrow; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

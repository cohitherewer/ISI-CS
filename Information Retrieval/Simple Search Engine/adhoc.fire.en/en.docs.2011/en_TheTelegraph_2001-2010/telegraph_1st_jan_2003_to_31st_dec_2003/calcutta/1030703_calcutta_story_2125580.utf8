 Thursday, July 03, 2003 				 Eatery worker found with throat slit
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 40-year-old employee of an eatery was found murdered on Wednesday morning at his workplace near Sealdah, in the Muchipara police station area. The victim, identified as Kanu Das, was found with his throat slit.																								Police said the murder took place early in the morning when the other workers of the eatery were sleeping. The murder was committed silently and none of Kanus colleagues heard a thing, said Naseem Ali, officer-in-charge of Muchipara thana.																								Preliminary investigation revealed that Kanu, who hailed from Bongaon, was murdered by a colleague, Swapan Maity. The two had an argument a few days ago, which may have led to the murder. We are not sure what exactly the motive was, said an official of Muchipara police station. Swapan is absconding.																								An examination of the body revealed that the murder took place around 5 am. Swapan, a resident of Basirhat, slashed Kanus neck with a kitchen knife. Officer-in-charge Ali said four workers, including Swapan and Kanu, would sleep in the eatery every night. 																								The other two employees  Ranjit Biswas and Manabrata Jana  found the body and called in the police. We are interrogating them, said Muchipara thana officials, adding: They have told us that the duo retired on Tuesday night as usual and they had not noticed anything abnormal in their behaviour.																								According to police, Ranjit and Manabrata would sleep in the dinning-space of the eatery, while Swapan and Kanu would make their beds in front of the kitchen. We woke up as usual around 5 am and saw Kanus body, Ranjit and Manabrata told the police during interrogation.																								Officer-in-charge Ali claimed: We have some leads which cannot be disclosed now for the sake of investigation. We are verifying the incident from all possible aspects.																								The police also questioned the eaterys owner, Indrajit Roy. Both the victim and the suspect were casual workers. Kanu joined the shop a few days ago, while Swapan had been working for several months. The eatery owner was not aware of any rivalry between them, disclosed Ali.																								A hunt has been launched for the suspected culprit. The police have contacted their counterparts in Basirhat, Swapans ancestral village. If necessary, we will send a team there. Besides, raids are being conducted at several places in and around the city, where the suspect may have taken refuge. The adjacent police stations have also been alerted, said the Muchipara thana official probing the case. Fill and win: Indian Oil  Corporation and Power 107.8 FM have come together for a  three-week-long promotional campaign, from June 30 to July  20, at 22 Indian Oil petrol pumps. When the driver fills  up his car at these outlets, a Power 107.8 FM sticker will  be pasted on the rear windscreen of the vehicle.

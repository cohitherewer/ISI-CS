		 Monday, December 01, 2003 				 Odour disorder from vat of discontent
		 Garbage lies uncleared in front of Behalas  Metropolitan College. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryPradeep Sarkar: There is a vat in our area in which a hotel-owner dumps all kinds of refuse, especially at night. The litter emits a stench that permeates the entire area. It has become very difficult for us to put up with this every day. Not only commuters, but students of a nearby school, too, have to bear the stench till conservancy men come and clear the vat. We have asked the hotel-owner to spread bleaching powder on the spot to check the smell but he is least bothered. Will you please do something?																																																													I am aware of the problem that the vat is posing, as you have said. Every tax-paying citizen has the right to live in a clean atmosphere. I have already talked to the chairman of Borough XIV about this. He has assured me of early action. He will take up the matter with the hotel-owner. The vat will be cleaned daily, as it is done now.

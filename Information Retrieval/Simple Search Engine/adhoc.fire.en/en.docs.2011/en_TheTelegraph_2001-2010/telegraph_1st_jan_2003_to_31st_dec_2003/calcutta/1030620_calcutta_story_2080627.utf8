 Friday, June 20, 2003 				 Reflections of Varanasi
The ancient town of Varanasi, also known as Kashi, has a unique character. This living, pulsating city is a montage of the multiple emotions of its inhabitants. Nay, the city is a mute witness to the ageless, faceless tableaux of civilisations in different centuries. Situated on the banks of the Ganga, Hindus consider this town holy and believe only the righteous souls embrace death here and are transported to heaven. This is also a place where nepotism, corruption and all other evils are perpetrated on the weak and ageing people in the garb of religion. This city is regarded a haven for the Hindu widows and destitutes. In Varanasi, the city of dichotomies, time seems to stand still, inspiring creativity. Poets, writers, artists, musicians have thronged this city from time immemorial, soaking in the colour, flavour and everything typical about Kashi. Arindam Boses fifth solo exhibition of paintings focuses on the various facets of Varanasi.																								When: Till today; 4 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Identity Gallery, 22, Ballygunge Park Road, Himadri Apartment																								 (opposite Ice Skating Rink)

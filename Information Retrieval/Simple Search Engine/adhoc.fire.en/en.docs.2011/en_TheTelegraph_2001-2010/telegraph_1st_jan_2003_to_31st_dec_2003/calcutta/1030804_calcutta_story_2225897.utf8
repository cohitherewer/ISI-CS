The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, August 04, 2003 				 At home
																								Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak left Calcutta in 1961 and got her green card in the US in 1966. For the major part of the last 40 years, her status has been that of a non-resident alien in the US, and she still holds an Indian passport. What does it mean to be a non-resident and an alien in a place where one spends nearly all of ones working life? In what sense is such a place home? What, for that matter, does it mean to be non-resident Indian? Spivak has in the past described herself as an unpatriotic citizen, not at home in either India or the US. Yet she hardly thinks of herself as being away or abroad or in exile. Her distinguished career as cultural theorist, critic and translator derives much of its strength from her sturdy refusal to be either rooted or dislodged from any of the several languages and cultural spaces she inhabits. What does home or citizenship mean for a diasporic intellectual? Is there a home in the most material sense that a culturally amphibious life can help create? These are some of the issues Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak will be discussing with Swapan Chakravorty in a conversation presented by Seagull.																								When: Today at 7 pm																								Where: G.D. Birla Sabhagar

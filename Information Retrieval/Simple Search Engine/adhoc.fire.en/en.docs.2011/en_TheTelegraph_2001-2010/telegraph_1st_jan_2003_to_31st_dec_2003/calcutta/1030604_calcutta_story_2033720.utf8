 Wednesday, June 04, 2003 				 Minor shift in build plans okayed
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has another sop for house-owners. He has relaxed building rules in the city, allowing for minor alterations within the plinth area, in deviation from the construction proposal sanctioned by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC).																								Municipal commissioner Debasis Som issued a circular on Monday to give effect to the mayors decision. 																								Minor deviations from the sanctioned plan within the plinth area will be allowed for residential purposes only. But it cannot encroach upon the mandatory open space, announced Mukherjee.																								The mayor believes that houses are built as per owners requirements and very often, the owner feels the need to alter the original plan. 																								The rigidity of the building rules, he said, is nothing short of persecution. I am allowing the house-owner the freedom to alter sanctioned plans, except for drastic changes.																								Now, the house-owner can raise a wall inside a hall to convert it into two rooms or dismantle an existing wall between two rooms for a larger hall. Similarly, construction of a small toilet on the roof or in one corner of a balcony will not be counted as illegal.																								In another major policy decision, the mayor has given financial relief to a plot-owner in revalidating a construction proposal of an incomplete building. The revalidation rates have been slashed by 15 per cent.																								The civic building department sanctions a construction proposal for a period of five years. If a plot-owner fails to complete the construction by then, he has to get the construction proposal revalidated from the CMC. 																								The revalidation fees are charged on the measurements of the portion that remains to be constructed. Earlier, a plot-owner would have to shell out 90 per cent of the sanction fees again to revalidate the plan if he failed progress beyond plinth level in five years time. Now, hell have to pay 75 per cent of the sanction fees only as revalidation charges.

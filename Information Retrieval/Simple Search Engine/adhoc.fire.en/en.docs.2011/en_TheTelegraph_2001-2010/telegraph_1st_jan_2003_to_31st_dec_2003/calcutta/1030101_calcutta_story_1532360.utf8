 Wednesday, January 01, 2003 				 Burrabazar godown raid
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Armed dacoits stormed a cloth merchants godown-cum-shop on Jamunalal Bajaj Street, in Burrabazar, on Monday night and fled with Rs 4.5 lakh. Even after 24 hours, no arrests have been made in this connection.																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner, detective department, said the incident took place around 9.30 pm, when the owner, Nand Kishore Mohta, was about to shut shop. Four youths in their late twenties walked into the shop. Two of them threatened Mohta with revolvers, while two others stood guard near the entrance, said Mitra, adding that the staff at the shop was too stunned to react.																								The Burrabazar police said the dacoits were tipped off about the cash in the shop. We are sure its an insiders job. A breakthrough is, however, expected within a day or two, officials promised.																								Later, traders in the area charged the police with inaction against the rise in criminal activities. We will step up vigil in the area, asserted Burrabazar thana officials on Tuesday.

																								Four ordinary women (a mother and her three daughters), and some common people surrounding them. Their happiness and sorrows, their yearnings, their desires and their frustrations are all very familiar to us. But there are momentary flashes that tend to disturb the apparent calmness, the equilibrium of our known world.

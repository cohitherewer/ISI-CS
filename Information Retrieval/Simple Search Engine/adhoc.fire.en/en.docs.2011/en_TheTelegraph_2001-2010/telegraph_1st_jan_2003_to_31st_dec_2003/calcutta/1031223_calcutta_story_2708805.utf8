The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 23, 2003 				 Fog foils flight, delays train
 																											- Departures to and from Delhi thrown haywire at night, dawn OUR BUREAU																								Chand Kachroo, a Delhi-based businessman, had a vital meeting with Wipro officials in Calcutta at 9.30 am on Monday. But dense fog at Delhi airport delayed his Jet Airways flight by nine hours, and he finally touched down in town at 4.50 pm. Last heard, Kachroo was desperately trying to track down the Wipro executives and set up a late-evening meeting.																								Kachroo was not the only passenger whose plans were foiled by the fog that enveloped Delhi airport and railway stations, sending flight and train schedules haywire and forcing many to cancel appointments and reschedule programmes.																								The first batch of passengers was fog-hit on Sunday evening, when Indian Airlines announced that its evening flight to Delhi stood cancelled, and the flight would leave on Monday morning. As a result, all passengers were accommodated in a city hotel and Flight IC 402 finally left at 9.30 am.																								Another Indian Airlines flight, scheduled to leave for Delhi at 7 am, was held up by two hours, before taking off at 9 am. We had taken the worst possible scenario into consideration, but things improved significantly later in the day and all our later flights left for Delhi without trouble, an Indian Airlines spokesperson said on Monday.																								Like Indian Airlines, Jet Airways, too, had to cancel its last evening flight to Delhi on Sunday. The same flight (JW 902) left Calcutta at 9.15 am on Monday.																								The private airline also combined two of its flights (JW 901 and JW 902), after heavy fog over Delhi ensured that neither of the two morning flights (the ones scheduled to leave at 6.30 am and 8.55 am, respectively) could leave Calcutta airport in the morning.																								Passengers of both flights were bundled into a single flight (JW 902) and departed for Delhi at 9.30 am. This flight, however, landed in Delhi without any trouble, a Jet Airways spokesperson confirmed.																								The private airline also had to make similar arrangements in Delhi, after two of its corresponding flights to Calcutta were delayed by several hours.																								A combined flight left Delhi for Calcutta after 3 pm and finally reached here around 4.50 pm.																								Dense fog also delayed many Calcutta-bound long-distance trains from Delhi. The Doon Express, scheduled to leave Delhi at 6.55 am, was running four hours late and was expected to reach Howrah at about 11 pm. The Punjab Mail, supposed to reach Howrah at 7.50 pm, was not expected till 1 am.																								Divisional railway manager (Howrah) Swapan Chowdhury said even in the morning, several long-distance and local trains were running late due to the fog.																								The Lalquila Express, from Delhi, reached Sealdah station nine hours behind schedule, at around 2.45 pm.

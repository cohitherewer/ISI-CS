 Monday, July 14, 2003 				 A solitary quest
A painting is an external manifestation of the artists thought process and delineation of the subject reflects his command over the medium. Suhas Roy is a senior artist who has been painting for more than five decades. For him art has always been the guiding spirit in his search for the ultimate truth and beauty. His quest for tracing the cosmic pattern of life is reflected in his works  a solitary pilgrim treading along virgin routes, often fraught with danger and constantly being aware of getting lost in oblivion. Roy stands as an exception in the contemporary Indian art scene with his immense passion for freshness sans complexities, his quest for beauty and emancipation. He admits the complexities that overcome the creative mind today, but endeavours consciously to avoid the current trends and swim against the tide to establish his own statement. In the process, his position as a creative genius is confirmed.

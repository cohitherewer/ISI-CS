The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, December 25, 2003 				 Shutout teacher strides back
 SUNANDO SARKAR 				 	 Mukherjee: Chair regained. Picture by Amit Datta																								Nearly four years ago, she was horribly trapped  the collapsible gate of a school, of which she was headmistress, was shut on her. On Wednesday, a smile crossed her face as she found herself caught again between those gates, by a camera recording her entry into the institute she had been hounded out of.																								For Purabi Mukherjee, headmistress of Belghoria Jatin Das Vidyamandir for Girls, the wheel has come full circle. Beaten out of her school in April 2000 by a section of CPM cadre wanting her replaced by a district secretariat members wife, she had charges of financial mismanagement levelled against her. 																								The charges, the government later found, were false. Mukherjee has now reclaimed her rightful place, following a Calcutta High Court order.																								The school is in the midst of examinations and Mukherjee, armed with Justice Maharaja Sinhas verdict, delivered a fortnight ago, has dived head first into a headmistress functions. After entering the school with police escort, she has been welcomed back by her colleagues and her students.																								Mukherjee joined the school in September 1990 and, within a few years, found an influential section within the school  and without  intent on not allowing her to function. Allegations of financial mismanagement cropped up repeatedly and an independent probe by the school education department, that failed to find anything wrong, did not help her.																								Simultaneously, consistent lobbying to replace her with the wife of a CPM district secretariat member began. It did not help, either, that the school was in an area under the political jurisdiction of a local committee secretary who was part of this CPM leaders extended family.																								The final showdown occurred in April 2000, when outsiders, known to be party cadre in the locality, dragged Mukherjee out of the school. Her salary was also blocked and the government clean chit did nothing to restore that, forcing her to move court. An order to restore her salary and allow her to work went unheeded, prompting Mukherjee to file a contempt suit.																								The court again ordered the school education department to pay Mukherjee her arrears and asked the district administration to ensure her entry into school. We will have to ensure her rejoining as, otherwise, we will be guilty of contempt of court, an officer told the Belghoria (East) local committee. But it was only after the district leadership was contacted that the party relented.																								Mukherjee, caught unawares on Wednesday as she was entering school, said: I thank everyone, including the judiciary, who has helped me return to school and my colleagues for making me feel at home.

 Recreating and reconnecting an era
  Vivan Sundaram is one of our foremost contemporary artists who has been engaged with this unique Sher-Gil project for over three decades. He has been single-handedly managing the role of curator, editor and archivist to capture an entire era through the life and times of the Sher-Gil family, specially the most luminous and controversial genius of the family, Amrita. The Sher-Gil Archive, an exhibition based on material from Sundarams maternal ancestry (he is Umrao Singh Sher-Gils grandson), was held in Budapest in 1995. The archive comprises mostly family photographs taken by Umrao Singh Sher-Gil. From here, Sundaram deviated to something more original  a re-interpretation of the photographs through digital photomontages, Re-take of Amrita. As he says, The digital intervention allows me to work on the edge of the old photograph as readymade. Representing the photographs in this series, I have narrativised sets of relationships between different members of the family. The relation between the father, Umrao Singh Sher-Gil and the daughter, Amrita Sher-Gil, forms the central axis of the cinematic plot. I enter the space of the Sher-Gil homes to explore and amplify the family scenario, and then make them enact (and re-enact) a monent under my direction ...The digital coupling ... makes it possible to de-dramatise the original shot with a playful, at times, ironical, retake. The show is hosted by the Seagull Foundation for the Arts.When: Till March 23; 2 pm - 7 pmWhere: Seagull Arts  Copyright

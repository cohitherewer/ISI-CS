 Monday, February 03, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									Every evening after work, I walk down Mayo Road to catch a bus home. The road is always unlit. The reason is unknown. Or is it kept dark deliberately so that attention is drawn to Mahatma Gandhis statue, which is illuminated? The road is also quite accident-prone. 				 																																									S.K. Roy Chowdhury, Kidderpore.				 																																									Gift cheques are in great demand, especially during the wedding season. But banks are reluctant to issue them. The explanations vary: the branch has no arrangement to issue gift cheques, or the stocks have exhausted, or that they can be issued only to account-holders of the branch. 				 																																									Ranu Mukherjee, 				 																																									Bagbazar.

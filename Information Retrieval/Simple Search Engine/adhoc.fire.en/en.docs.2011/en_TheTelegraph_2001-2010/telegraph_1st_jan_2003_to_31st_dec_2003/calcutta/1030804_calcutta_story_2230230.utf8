 Ram Avtar Mundra: A flat-owner can be held responsible for tax dues only after he occupies the flat. If there are any tax arrears pending before he occupies the flat, the promoter should be held responsible. If you put up a notice on the pending tax dues of a building outside the premises, everyone will take note. 																																																													Most promoters do not collect completion certificates from the corporation. They come only at the time of sanctioning the plans. I would advise everyone to collect occupational and ownership certificates from the corporation to avoid any harassment before taking possession of a flat.

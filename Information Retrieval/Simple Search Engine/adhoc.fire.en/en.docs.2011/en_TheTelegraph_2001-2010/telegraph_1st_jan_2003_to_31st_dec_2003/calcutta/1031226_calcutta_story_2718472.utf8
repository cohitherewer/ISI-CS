 Friday, December 26, 2003 				 Lessons from Howrah for Majherhat
 Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta																								The railways are on the verge of taking a momentous decision that will affect the growth of the city in the next half-a-century or more. Virtually 150 years after setting up the Howrah passenger terminal and 142 years after Sealdah station came up, a third passenger terminal is finally being contemplated in the city. Reports suggest that the decision has already been taken, in principle.																								Availability of land reportedly tilted the decision in favour of the area around the existing Majherhat railway station on the Budge Budge section, just beyond New Alipore. The goods terminal at Shalimar on the Howrah side will continue to take care of industrial freight and the planned Chitpur terminal will also hopefully ease some of the pressure on the two existing stations. The proposed station at Majherhat is, however, the most ambitious project by far and could well take a decade or more to execute.																								But it is by no means clear if the decision has been taken after consultations with town planners, the CMC, the CMDA and other similar agencies. What is apparent, however, is that no attempt has been made so far to hear what the people feel about the subject. The railways could actually conduct a contest, seeking ideas from experts and people, and in return for some prize money, may actually receive some good ideas.																								Is it a good idea to have a passenger terminal at Majherhat? Especially in view of the warning that once this new station comes up, the railways will not even toy with the idea of a new terminal for the next 100 years. Besides another rail and road bridge over the river, the new station will require a modern transit system and several flyovers to cope with vehicular traffic 20 years from now. The Diamond Harbour Road and the Majherhat road-bridge even now deal with heavy vehicular traffic and may not be able to cope with more. Judging by past precedents, the planned bridge over the river and the terminal are unlikely to come up before 15 more years and by that time todays architects would have long retired.																								It is also not clear if sufficient statistics are available to indicate how many passengers from the northern fringes of the city and beyond travel to Howarh station and catch long-distance trains. 																								How much time do passengers take in reaching Howrah station and how many of them spend more money to reach the station than pay for the railway ticket? With the city expanding to the east and the Northeast, it is not certain if a new station in the south is such a good idea after all. That is why it is even more important to tread cautiously and take everything into account before venturing into something that will cost taxpayers a packet.																								There is little doubt that Howrah station, which today handles 500 trains and a million passengers every day, requires to be rescued. 																								The solution probably does not lie in increasing the number of platforms, which has in any case gone up from two in 1865 to 21 today. But the experience at Howrah provides valuable lessons for stations of the future. While the railways have executed the Herculean task of managing the mammoth numbers well, the transit system at Howrah leaves much to be desired. The approach remains chaotic. 																								Whats worse, even at 8 am, the whole place stinks of the stale smell of rotten leaves, fruits, vegetables, leftover food and even vomit. Even the mellow winter morning, the mist over the river and the breathtaking view of the majestic bridge are completely overshadowed by this overpowering stench of stale food, garbage and smoke. It is a strange welcome to the city. The carnival, the millennium park, the concern over the Maidan seem puerile. Forget about aesthetics; we need to restore some method in the madness swirling around Howrah station.																								Even the route-locking system, which was upgraded a few months ago after shutting down Howrah station for three days, does not seem to be working well. Most long-distance trains are forced to wait at Tikiapara or at the outer signal, often for half an hour or more and for reasons that are not always very clear. Citizens, it seems, can only hope that lessons from Howrah will be learnt and mistakes will not be repeated.

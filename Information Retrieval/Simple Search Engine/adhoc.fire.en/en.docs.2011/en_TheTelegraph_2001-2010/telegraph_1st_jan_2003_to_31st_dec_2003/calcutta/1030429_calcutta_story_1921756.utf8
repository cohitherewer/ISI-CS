																								Nokshi Kanthar Maath (The Field of the Embroidered Quilt) is a dramatised version of the verse narrative written by Jasimuddin. The simple folk tale centres around a peasant youth, Rupa, who fell in love with a girl from his neighbouring village and they got married. But bitter sorrow followed them. Rupa left hearth and home, was forced to flee far away. The young wife waited every day with expectant, bated breath. False hopes fed her; long days passed; she pined away to death. The story, in a nutshell, is this simple, but as director Goutam Halder says, every return to the poem confronted him with the overwhelming quest for a theatrical form that would adequately express this realisation. The search, in fact, began with a problem of classification: was Nokshi Kanthar Maath a folk verse-narrative or a fairy tale; was it a social-realist narrative in verse or a folk song; was it a tale of mans Edenic innocence or a paean to love; was it the remote wailing of a shepherds flute among tales untold, a story of loss and pain that has been and will be again; or was it grandmas magical story-telling on an evening long ago? Was this poem a synthesis of all these and much more? Produced by Kalyani Natyacharcha Kendra, this play will be followed by Barne Badye Kabye Gitite Goutam Halder  a musical performance by Goutam Halder and assisted by Swatilekha Sengupta. 																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

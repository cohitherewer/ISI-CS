 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Civic staff howl over internal test mess
 OUR BUREAU																								For the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), looking for a way out of the forced freeze on recruitment, an internal examination this Saturday may mark a successful start to its redeployment strategy. But, like all things CMC, this, too, has become mired in controversy.																								The civic body is facing a severe crunch, vis--vis its food-inspector manpower. A department that should have 27 non-medical inspectors, has only two. So, an internal examination is to be held among its staff to fill up the vacant posts.																								But the circular notifying the staff on the examination has not been seen by most of the eligible candidates, sparking off threats to move court. 																								Hundreds want to apply for the posts and sit for the test, said head of the CITU-controlled staff union Amalendu Bhattacharya on Wednesday. But, with the authorities not circulating the notice well in advance, many of them will not be able to do so, he said, adding that there were many who were thinking on the lines of moving court. The secrecy gives rise to suspicion about the authorities motive, one of the candidates said.																								The test is to be held on December 20 and the 100-mark paper has been set by municipal commissioner Debashis Som. The notice was issued by the office of deputy municipal commissioner (personnel) Samiresh Chatterjee on November 17 and reached departmental heads the same day, officials said. The last date for applying was November 29.																								But, in a set-up where files take years to move, the 12-day period, apparently, was not enough for the departmental heads to circulate the notice. So, less than 140 candidates have applied.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee was aware of the mix-up. We will invite other applications if this test fails to fill all the vacancies, he said. He invited candidates to write to him individually about their willingness to appear for the subsequent test.

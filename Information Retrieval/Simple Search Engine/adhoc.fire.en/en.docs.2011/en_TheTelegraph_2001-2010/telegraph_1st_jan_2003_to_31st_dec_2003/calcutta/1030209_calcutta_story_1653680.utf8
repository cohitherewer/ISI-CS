 Sunday, February 09, 2003 				 Rebel CPM MP hints at crossover
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Four days after he openly accused the leadership of siphoning off funds for development, rebel CPM MP Radhika Ranjan Pramanik on Saturday did not rule out the possibility of joining forces with Mamata Banerjee before the panchayat elections.																								Pramanik, a five-term CPM MP from Mathurapur, in South 24-Parganas, alleged that thieves and murderers had infiltrated the organisation. He also complained that the CPM had forced him to sign forged documents and part with money from the MPs local area development funds. Mamata had told me a long time ago to quit the CPM and join Trinamul Congress as I was not being given due respect in the organisation, he said.																								The Trinamul Congress leader has already lauded Pramaniks anti-CPM crusade and announced that she expected him to join her party to step up a united movement against the ruling communists. 																								Pramanik on Saturday claimed to have written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the necessity of setting up a nuclear power project in Bengal.																								nRoad mishap: An unidentified man died in a road accident in Howrah on Saturday morning. The victim, aged around 30, was hit by a vehicle on Bamundanga bridge in Bali, police said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, October 08, 2003  In the Puja spirit
 An Eye on Calcutta / Barry  O'Brien Whats life on a Puja committee  without a little jhamela? I speak from experience.  At most of our meetings, we invariably agreed to disagree.  Sometimes these meetings end with  a toast of camaraderie on Bapi-das chaad,  where the past is forgotten  or at least washed away   and everyone gets into the right spirit! Sometimes it just  ends, and another breakaway Puja takes place the following  year a block or two away. Of course, like everything else,  this too is a part of tradition. Apparently, some time in  the late 1760s in Guptipara, Hooghly, 12 angry young men  were stopped from taking part in a family puja. They  promptly stormed off, formed a 12-member committee, collected  chanda and organised the first community Durga Puja.  Now you know why your para puja is called a baroari  puja (baro  twelve; yar  friend). What is no less ironical is the  fact that in 1757 when Clive wanted a grand thanksgiving  service for his victory at Plassey, there was no church  to have it in. Heres how the problem was solved. A golden  sofa was placed for him in the open quadrangle in Shobhabazar  and the first Company Puja was held at 36, Raja Nabakrishna  Deb Street. Soon it became a prestige issue for family  pujas  who could have more sahibs attending the  celebrations? Nautch girls entertained; the Englishmen wined  and dined on ham and beef; Wilsons Hotel catered; and religion  took a backseat.  Ironically, everything changed  drastically 150 years later. At the community puja held  at Balaram Basu Ghat Road in 1910  the year the Indian  National Congress session was held in Calcutta  the celebration  had a definite nationalist undercurrent. The organisers  pledged a fight for freedom, with Durga symbolising the  motherland. Swadeshi goods were on sale near the pandals  and lathi khelas took centrestage. The fight was  well and truly on.  And if you think monitoring decibel  levels is something new, think again.  Rani Rashmoni didnt entertain  sahibs at her residence near Jan Bazar; her centrepiece  was an all-night jatra. The story goes that a sahib  complained about the noise one night. Rashmoni led an even  louder procession on the street the following day. She was  fined Rs 55. Its amazing how many of us want  to get away from Calcutta during the Pujas. Its a bit like  running away from your city when its hosting the Olympic  Games  everyone wants to come in for it and you want to  run away! Since I found this bewildering and disturbing,  I decided to make a few calls to find out why people chose  to do something so irrational. Why would anyone want to  leave while it was all happening?  My mini survey reveals that people  leave precisely for that reason: because its all happening.  The Mitras of Ekdalia cant handle the non-stop music and  announcements on the PA system, so they chill out in a friends  baganbadi; the Deb Roys of Kasba dont know where  to park their car because theres a puja just outside  their home, so they drive off anywhere for a couple of days;  the Saxenas of Chittaranjan Avenue got into a takkar  over chanda a couple of years ago, so they leave  town every year to avoid the tension; the Rakshits of  Salt Lake go to Delhi with deeda  there she can  go puja-hopping with the family, because here its  not possible. Are these people irrational? Or  are they just sensible? I mean, how do you go puja-hopping  with deeda who needs to find a toilet every couple  of hours? How does your matha remain thanda  when the bonnet of your new Zen is being used alternatively  as a park bench and a makeshift dhak by some deadly-  looking dadas.  The Telegraph-CESC True Spirit Puja  movement aimed at highlighting how certain Puja committees  had made a special effort this year to make the celebrations  safer, happier and more meaningful  Making a difference Though I never like missing out  on the Pujas because thats when people pack up their troubles  and smile, smile, smile, I can understand why many others  dont. The good news is that as of this year, a spirited  movement has begun to encourage Puja committees to make  the pujas safer, happier and more meaningful.  About a week before the Pujas,  we invited the representatives of Puja committees to brief  them about The Telegraph-CESC True Spirit Puja effort. Moderated  by the charming Bratati Bandopadhayay, representatives from  a little over a hundred pujas made a commitment that  they would leave no stone unturned to be True Spirit Pujas.  Seventy-nine of them were shortlisted.  Inspite of the fact that it wasnt  a contest, Puja committees put in a sincere effort in three  areas: safety measures, civic consciousness and social commitment.  A panel of assessors comprising representatives of CESC,  The Telegraph, PUBLIC, KMC, the Fire Department,  the Pollution Control Board together with a group of celebrities  and young reporters of The Telegraph in Schools,  went pandal-hopping to decide which Pujas were indeed  True Spirit ones. They werent primarily looking at how  elaborate the lighting was and how exquisite the image was;  they were taking a close look at fire safety measures, first  aid, eco-friendliness, facilities for senior citizens and  the physically challenged, whether electricity norms had  been followed, decibel levels and anything that could help  or hinder the true spirit of the Pujas. After three days of surprise visits,  friendly investigation and meticulous marking, several assessment  teams concluded that a few pujas had to be disqualified  for reasons ranging from power-thefts to park-damage and  para-uncleanliness. They also concluded that 26 pujas  had made a special effort this year to make the celebrations  safer, happier and more meaningful. Heres how some of them  did it. While most pujas were being  inaugurated by filmstars and cricketers, the one organised  by Kalighat Milan Sangha had a 103-year-old didima  who sells ghootey, doing the honours. Another in  Behala, was inaugurated by 11-year-old Soma, the school-going  daughter of a sex worker.  The organisers of the Dum Dum  Park 4 Tank Yubak Brinda Puja took great care of their parar  chotto park by covering the grass with tarpaulin and  then laying the sand to create the authentic approach towards  their ancient rock-cave pandal. Thousands of footfalls  later, the grass on the park is as fresh as it was on Panchami. Sarodiya Sammilani, a tiny little  puja overshadowed in size by Ekdalia Evergreen, stood  tall in spirit through its whole-hearted community involvement.  Their para kitchen worked round the clock to feed  each and every family in the locality as well as those who  visited the puja each night, right through the week. A puja in Manicktola, when  asked why their lighting seemed far more subdued than in  earlier years, confessed that after our briefing session  they decided not to do what they have been doing all along:  consume a greater amount of power than they had applied  for. Thats true spirit for you. The Brindaban Matri Mandir Puja  could have done what so many others do: block a street and  celebrate. Instead, they allowed a smooth flow of traffic  through Sukeas Street and conducted their puja in  the cramped confines of a garage. But the one that lifted my spirits  the most was the puja at Tangra Gholpara. They had  transformed the unhygenic surroundings of the tanneries  into a pristine Purulia village charmed by charismatic chau  dancers. What made the effort even more meaningful was that  it was put together by a they comprising not only Mondals,  Mullicks and Mitras, but many Alams, Alis and Ahmeds.  Some of these pujas have  been given a star rating and The Telegraph will now  join hands with them to take the true spirit of the pujas  into their everyday lives in a small but meaningful way:  it could be the building of a public toilet, the funding  of a dispensary or the running of a night school. It is  this that will keep the true spirit of the Pujas alive till  the next one comes along; and when it does, Im sure the  Mitras, Deb Roys and Majumdars will be around to experience  the true spirit of the pujas. Its catching on!

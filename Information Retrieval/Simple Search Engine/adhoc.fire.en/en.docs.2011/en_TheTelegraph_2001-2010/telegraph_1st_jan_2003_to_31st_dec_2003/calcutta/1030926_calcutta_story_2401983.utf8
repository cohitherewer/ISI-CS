	The Corporation had cleaned some drainage pipes around  Rowland Road a few days ago. The sludge scooped out of the  pipes was dumped on the pavements. Pedestrians had to walk  along the road. When I called up the CMC, the employee at  the other end assured me that it would be cleared within  a day or two. Such cooperation from the civic authorities  was a pleasant surprise. 
	 Purnima Vasudeva, Rowland Road.  
	The staff of Dover Lane post office cold shoulders customers  availing of the governments monthly income scheme. The  post office is always short on forms and the employees never  have a definite answer as to when these will be available.  
	Vijay Jain, Nundy Street.  
	There is no direct bus from Bangur Avenue to Alipore zoo.  Residents will benefit if buses on route 227, plying between  Bangur Avenue and the BNR office, run via Alipore zoo.  
	 B.N. Bose, Dum Dum Park.

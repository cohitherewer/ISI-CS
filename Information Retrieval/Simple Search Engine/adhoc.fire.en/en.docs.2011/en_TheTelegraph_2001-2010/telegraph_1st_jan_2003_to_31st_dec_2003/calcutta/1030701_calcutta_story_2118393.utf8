The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, July 01, 2003 				 Rise amp; fall of shining stars
 Aamir and Sourav: Dashing duo Movie mania rules Generation Y.  Why else would it be an actor, over politicians, sportsmen,  activists and economists who are its true idols? Young Metro  had nominated last month seven names as potential candidates  for Star of the Year. The results are in, and the starry-eyed  have spoken... Aamir Khan				 				 																															Actor-producer Aamir leads the list. Hes bagged the most votes. Reasons include a) that he is a darling (who needs any other reason? Get down on your knees and salivate) b) Mera dil chahta hai Aamir, for all years, qayamat se qayamat tak, not just 2003 c) The enigmatic actor has a mind-boggling personality and a thinking head. What more can any mere mortal want? Sourav Ganguly				 				 																															Dada follows in second place, but he has suffered a serious blow from one respondent, who pooh-poohed the Bengal tiger in favour of the un-nominated Sachin! The World Cup Man of the Tournament, wrote in this fan, is the best and that entire anthologies can be put together on his achievements. But loyalists love the India captain for galvanising and inspiring the boys in blue, and making them a truly world-class side. And also his attitude and competitiveness that believes in giving back as good as he gets. N.R. Narayana Murthy				 				 																															The man with the millions has to be the choice of the B-school generation. The IT top gun in third place was ranked high up in most replies (though it may be interesting to note that very few gave reasons. Numbers, not words, said it all in the race). The Infosys chief was lauded for his vision, which, apparently inspires youth across the country, not just young Calcutta. A call for hundreds more like him was also registered. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee				 				 																															Politics and dhoti may be unfashionable with the youth of today, but Buddha managed to hold his own in the pop poll. The chief ministers efforts to steer the state to numero uno position and his progressive ideas may not have made him first choice for too many, but he was a healthy first runner-up on most lists. A tribute to his do-it-now mantra, surely. Amartya Sen				 				 																															A similar verdict was in for this Nobel laureate. The idealist scored for his astounding achievements as well as for his role as a terrific ambassador for India wherever he goes. Prannoy Roy				 				 																															The NDTV 24x7 man is still newsworthy. Again, hes a pop choice for first or second runner-up. Medha Patkar				 				 																															She can scream herself hoarse to save the Narmada, but young Calcutta is not listening. Environmental activist Medha had no mention, except at the bottom of one list followed by no comments. Is it the woman or is it the cause, we wonder?				 				 																
	 Inspired efforts!				 				 																															If stars are the gods, films are the religion. But is Bollywood letting down its devotees? Here are the final letters that flowed in about this months Time to Talk topic We are sick of Bollywood ripping off the West:				 				 																															lPlagiarism has always been known euphemistically in Bollywood as inspiration. Evidently, there is a definite lack of writing talent in Bollywood, what with every other movie being inspired by some Hollywood hit or the other. In Hollywood, there are numerous good scripts created, some are not even used. No such thing exists in Bollywood because here, producers believe that stars make hits. Our cinema is star-based, while Hollywood is script-based.				 				 																															However with the youth brigade taking over every aspect of film-making, things do look brighter for Indian cinema. Aamir Khans Lagaan, Farhan Akhtars Dil Chahta Hai, Ram Gopal Varmas Bhoot and Company are all examples of how original script ideas always prove to be a sure-fire way to success.				 				 																															Priyanka Aich,				 				 																															IIIrd year, St Xaviers College				 				 																															lIf we analyse Bollywood films made recently, we would probably find that about 99 per cent have been copied, inspired by, or are abridged forms of Hollywood hits. This is a sign that our countrys film-makers are loosing their value. We are gradually forgetting our own culture and heritage. It has been a long time since we saw a truly Indian movie, though these usually have a good chance of success. If we look at the example of films like Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam or Hum Aapke Hain Kaun?, we can see what really works, as such films have been enjoyed by people of all ages. They also reflect our identity as Indians. What we are really sick of is watching filthy scenes borrowed from the West. There is no doubt that we have great film-makers who are up to this challenge.

	 Bridge the gap				 				 																															Open up Bridge distances Reach out was the theme of Perception, the first inter-institutional festival organised by Apeejay School. Held on June 27 and 28 at the schools Park Street premises and Vidya Mandir respectively, 10 city schools included Mahadevi Birla Girls, Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, South Point, St Lawrence and St Thomas and others participated alongside two NGOs working with children, Sanlaap and Apeejay Anand Library.				 				 																															The students of the school have been striving to bridge the gap between the children of privilege and otherwise, and this was the first time students from NGOs participated as competitors alongside those from mainstreams schools.				 				 																															On Friday, off-stage events like creative writing and face painting were held, besides the Turncoat Debate on the topic Todays MTV generation is empty we. Poulami Sarkar was adjourned the best speaker, while the house verdict was against the motion. A collection of street plays was showcased, covering issues like sex education and ragging. Mahadevi Birla won first prize with their skit entitled Elbow Diye Thelbo. Apeejay and St Thomas Girl won the Tug of War.				 				 																															Day II began with ex-students Jishnu Sengupta and Chandra Prakash Saraogi acting as yumcees. The first event was Impact, with the participants having to incorporate lines like Atal to Jaya  Churaliya Hai Tumne Jo Dil Ko and Mamata Banerjee as Lara Croft, in which finally, South Point proved the smoothest. It also aced the quiz. Persona the fusion dance saw the schools shaking a leg, while in Unplugged Music, schools performed music soothing to the ears. Style was central for the theme fashion show, Women of Substance and Men of Worth. South Point won the music round while the hosts won the fashion show and choreography.				 				 																															All points tallied, Mahadevi Birla emerged Best Perception School, whilst Poulami Sarkar of Carmel was adjudged Perceptionist 03. 				 				 																															 Sangeet Shirodkar				 				 																															Apeejay School				 				 																
	 Cheer em on				 				 																															Another attempt to bridge the great divide will take the stage on July 6, when challenged children will have a reason to smile. Kshitij, the annual inter-school fest for handicapped children, will provide a day of fun to around 700 kids from over 20 schools including Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy, Manovikas Kendra, Mentaid and Reach.				 				 																															Organised by the Rotaract Club of Belur since 1998, the mornings events are to include a fancy dress competition, dance and drama. Games stalls, magic shows, snacks, a film, and appearances from clowns will also liven up the proceedings. A sit-and-draw competition has already been held at the individual schools. Students from mainstream schools also line up every year to help out.				 				 																
	 Money-wise				 				 																															A summer camp that teaches how to be a better manager? Though this may not seem to be everyones idea of chilling out during sweltering summer vacations, the response to the Millennium Youth movement may prove otherwise. The month-long sessions, which tackle tricky topics like the share market, investment, capital markets and business process outsourcing have caught on in its four years of functioning. The students of this years batch, which just concluded, organised a meet on Friday to spread the good word. Members of AIESEC, a youth exchange programme, were also present to announce cooperation between the two organisations.

				 	SHRADDHA MOR Shraddha Mor																									Is a common enough command from a teacher to a student. But in Shraddhas case, they told her to talk some more and become a lawyer. This third-year student at National University of Juridical Sciences (NUJS) argued a fellow students case so well as monitor in Class VII at Modern High School that she realised it was time to scrap dreams of becoming a doctor.																									In the shape of Arun Jaitley was all she had to hear to be convinced that the profession could be the one for her. Political science and current affairs soon became priority number one. In the second year of college, she was elected convenor of the constitutional law society. She was also chosen as a member of the executive council, where she is serving a second term.																									Came easily after that, with the perfect platform from which to have the student voice heard. The 21-year-old started organising seminars on contemporary legal issues, attended by political and legal personalities, including those on the rights of minority institutions under the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court ruling on the right to strike of public servants and guidelines issued by the Election Commission for candidates. The girl who stood seventh in the all-India NUJS entrance exams also participated in the Lok Adalat organised by the Legal Aid Society recently.																									Came to an end when Shraddhs had an early taste of responsibility as deputy head girl. Took on more work willingly, volunteering for the Little Sisters of the Poor and Manovikas Kendra for a year. Though constantly active  dabbling in foreign languages (basic German at Max Mueller Bhavan), sports (table tennis, badminton, throwball and basketball), captain of debating team (leading in inter-school war of words)  her grades refuse to suffer.																									Does the Piscean take to the swimming pool. The member of the Bharat Scouts and Guides and Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme has more than a passing interest in sports and adventure.

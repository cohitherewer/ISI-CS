 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Agony and ecstasy of an unusual artist
		 Sanjoy Ghosh Sanjoy Ghosh Hes a man of multiple roles.  Sanjoy Ghosh is a father, son, teacher, painter, sitar player  and he even has a day job. But there are many firsts in  the 45-year-olds life  he has a paralysed right arm, paints  with his left hand, plays the musical instrument with his  feet and has been a single parent since his daughter was  a few months old.																								More downs than ups comprise the story of Ghoshs life, but getting back on his feet after staring adversity in the eye is an attitude he has mastered. Struck by polio at age four, his limbs were affected and he was temporarily paralysed. He regained the use of his legs and left arm two years later, but the right arm was permanently damaged.																								Not one to give up easily, he promptly learnt how to make full use of his one hand and two feet. The budding artist became a student of Mrinmoy Mukherjee as a 12-year-old, picking up skills on watercolours, oil and acrylic on canvas and drawing. Four years later, in 1976, the first solo exhibition was held at the Academy of Fine Arts, followed by another in 1981.																								The man from Tollygunge continued with his painting, but had to get a job in an insurance company to keep the family going. We were not very well off, and my old parents were very ill, he says. He got married in the late 1980s, but that happiness didnt last very long. His wife succumbed to cancer in 1996, barely a couple of months after their daughter, Chandrika, was born.																								That hit me very hard emotionally. I wasnt sure how to cope, particularly with a baby to look after. If it hadnt been for my family, especially my brother Soumitra, and friends, I wouldnt have made it, Ghosh recalls. Personal tragedies took their toll, but not enough to stop his passion for painting. If I cant paint, I cant live. I work every night, from 11 pm to 2 am, after my daughter goes to sleep, he adds. He even finds time to teach art to youngsters.																								An exhibition at Swabhumi, from December 19 to January 1, comes after 23 years. Thirty-six colourful and vibrant drawings and paintings, picturing childhood innocence, the vagaries of life and the vastness of the universe, will be on display. It is my happiest moment in many years, Ghosh smiles.																								Modesty makes him shy away from talking about his sitar talents, because it is just something I like to do. Taught by his mother, he uses the same instrument that Ustad Vilayat Khan had gifted her. And he plays with his feet, since one hand is not enough and he was determined to learn.																								I just want people to like my paintings. What more do I need? Ghosh signs off.

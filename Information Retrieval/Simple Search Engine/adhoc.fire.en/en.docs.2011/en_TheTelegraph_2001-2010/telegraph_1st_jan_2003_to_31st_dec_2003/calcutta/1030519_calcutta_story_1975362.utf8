 							 - Hidco pushes infrastructure progress before plot handover SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								The Rajarhat New Township plots are to be handed over in October. It is a Puja bonus from the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco). People have been waiting for three years and more for their plots at the township. The plots are ready and they can start construction right away, said housing minister Gautam Deb.																								According to officials of Hidco, the nodal agency under the housing department to implement the township project, 5,600 plots will be handed over to both individuals and cooperatives in the first phase. Hidco has allotted nearly 2,600 individual plots and 3,000 cooperative plots in Action AreaI, that will house at least 30,000 dwelling units. Action AreaI, on roughly 660 hectares, comprises domestic plots for individuals and cooperatives, housing estates built by the West Bengal Housing Board through joint ventures, shopping plazas, roads, parks and gardens and a wetland.																								As many as 30,000 people won plots in the township by lottery. The delay in getting possession had sparked resentment. We could have handed over the plots earlier, but our intention was to develop the infrastructure fully before granting possession, said Pradyut Biswas, Hidco general manager. Work on the underground sewerage system is in progress. Plots will be demarcated after the system is in place, Biswas added. 																								Housing minister Deb, who is chairman of Hidco, said infrastructure development in all three sectors of the township was progressing on a war footing. The main and arterial roads, along with the service roads, are almost complete, he pointed out. Work for the sewerage system and the inner roads, link roads, lanes and bylanes is in progress. A power supply line will be laid shortly. A power sub-station has already been built, from where electricity will be supplied to at least 500 dwelling units. Though some more time is needed to complete all the work, people can start building their homes and even live there, Deb said.																								A task force has been formed to speed up development work in the township. Deb, who is personally monitoring the progress of work, said the Hidco would keep its pledge to the people.

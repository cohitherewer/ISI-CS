 Friday, November 07, 2003 				 Beef-up for contempt hearing
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Left Front chairman Biman Bose will appear on Friday before a Calcutta High Court division bench in response to a suo motu contempt notice the bench slapped on him for allegedly making disparaging comments on Justice Amitava Lalas ruling restricting weekday rallies.																								Justice Ashok Ganguly will preside over the bench, with another judge, yet unknown, replacing Justice S.P. Talukdar, who has fallen ill. The hearing will be held in courtroom no. 12. Elaborate security measures have been taken to avert any untoward incident. 																								The high court issued the contempt notice against the Left Front chairman on a petition by Minority Forum secretary Idris Ali, alleging that Bose had made several adverse comments against Justice Lala, his verdict and also against the judiciary.																								Court sources said Bose had already been served the notice and he will be present in court at 10.30 am. Bikash Bhattacharya, an eminent lawyer of the Left fold, will defend Bose in court. The Democratic Lawyers Association (DLA), the organisation of Left lawyers, has issued a mandate to its members, asking them to be present in the courtroom during the hearing.																								A few years ago, Bose faced a similar contempt notice for saying that court orders could be available against payment. Bose had escaped imprisonment by filing a petition in the Supreme Court against the order. 																								State advocate-general Balai Ray will not be able to take the brief for Bose as he is representing the state in the original rally-restriction case.

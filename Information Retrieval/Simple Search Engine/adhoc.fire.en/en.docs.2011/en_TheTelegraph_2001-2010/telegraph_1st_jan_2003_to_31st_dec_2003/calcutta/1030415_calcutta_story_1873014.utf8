		 Azhar Elahi Daad Khan 																	Too numerous to count have fallen prey to Azhars indoor cricket practice sessions. Couldnt keep his hands off the bat, so when his mother told him not to play in the streets, he had to get to work somewhere.																									And not because of the artistic value of his impressionist work. A very spotty wall was the result of his passion for strokeplay, and it was worth more than the glares it got him at home. It was his passport into Arun Lals cricket coaching centre. Though the 18-year-old had to give up the nets to prepare for the ICSE, he later started to play Cricket Association of Bengal matches for Marcus Square Recreation Club and later for Kalighat Club. He was a natural choice for the school team and represented his school, Saifee Hall, at the Milo inter-school tournament, Under-13 and Under-16 meets.																									For the green club, despite being busy with the bat. Vicky here was a member of the school nature club since Class VIII, competing in school fests. After hanging up his scout cap, he joined the NCC unit at St Xaviers College, where he is pursuing chemistry. He also does his bit for the college National Service Scheme unit, going for camps to Paikhala, a village adopted by the service wing. Was involved with HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns, blood donations and cleanliness drives.																									It is for Azhar, who has had a single dream ever since he was a little boy. A police officer is what he wants to be, and he will do anything to get there. He has already started studying for the IPS and other civil services exams so he gets a chance to serve his country.																									May be a close battle in Azhars mind, but Tom MI Cruise aint a patch on Pierce Bond Brosnan. Though craze for Mission Impossible II has won this guy the name Agent Hunt, the latest 007 leads his list of must-meet celebs. Dont be surprised if he manages either. From the age of 12, he has been making inroads through security cordons to within handshaking distance of stars like Aishwarya Rai, Raveena Tandon, Ajay Devgan, Abhishek Bachchan, Salman Khan and Subhash Ghai.

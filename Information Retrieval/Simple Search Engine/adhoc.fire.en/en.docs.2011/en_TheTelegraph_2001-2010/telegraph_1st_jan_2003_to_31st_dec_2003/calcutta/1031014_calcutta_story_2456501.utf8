 Tuesday, October 14, 2003 				 Festival of experimental plays
																								The Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) is a premier organisation propagating cultural activities in the city round the year. It has already created a niche for itself and connoisseurs of arts look forward to its various programmes. Its latest foray into the world of experimental plays will once again rejuvenate city theatre buffs. The Experimental Theatre Festival, beginning tomorrow, features five plays: three from West Bengal and one each from Orissa and Bihar. The plays will be staged at Academy of Fine Arts with a repeat show of each to be held the very next day at EZCCs Purbashree auditorium. The objective of this festival is twofold: to popularise theatre and strengthen the theatre movement in the country and to encourage innovation and experimentation by established theatrepersons and help them share their ideas and techniques with upcoming artistes, students and theatre enthusiasts in general.

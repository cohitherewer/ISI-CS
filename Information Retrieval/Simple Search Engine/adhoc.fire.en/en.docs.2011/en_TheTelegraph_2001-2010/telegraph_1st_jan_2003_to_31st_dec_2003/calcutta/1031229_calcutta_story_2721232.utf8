 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Appeals panel for ragging cases
 																											- Retired teacher drafted to head mandatory body after court prod A STAFF REPORTER																								Having been censured by Calcutta High Court for its tardiness in tackling ragging in educational institutions, the government has set in motion the process of setting up an appellate body for hearing ragging-related cases.																								Last week, the government appointed a retired university teacher to the post of vice-chairman of the West Bengal Council of Higher Education for, under the relevant Act, only a vice-chairman of the council can head the appellate body.																								Measures are being taken to ensure that the appeals committee is constituted within the time set by the court, said Jawhar Sircar, principal secretary, higher education department. He said such a committee had not been set up so far as there had been no need to do so.																								However, the governments hasty decision to appoint Subimal Sen, retired professor of Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, has raised eyebrows. According to critics, Sens appointment has flouted council norms, which stipulate that only a serving or retired vice-chancellor can function as the vice-chairman of the higher education council.																								It will be wrong to link Sens appointment to the courts observation, Sircar said. Pointing out that the constitution of such a body is mandatory on the part of the state government, in accordance with the rules laid down in the states three-year-old anti-ragging Act, the court ordered the government to set up the body within three weeks.																								The order was given in connection with a petition filed by five students of an engineering college in Kolaghat, suspended by the authorities on charges of ragging some first-year students in October.																								After receiving the suspension notices, the five students approached the state higher education council, requesting it to refer their case to its anti-ragging appeals committee for hearing. According to one of the clauses in the anti-ragging Act, if either the accused or the victim is not satisfied with the decision of the institution concerned (in this case, the five students felt their suspension was unjustified), they may approach the councils appeals committee for redress. 																								The council was unable to accept the students request, as no such appeals committee existed. The government had not set it up after formulating the anti-ragging Act three years ago. The suspended students later moved high court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, December 04, 2003 				 Shop shift to speed up cars for Bypass
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Hate to be held up at bridge no. 4, after zipping down the EM Bypass and the Park Circus connector? Take heart, the government has taken note of your woe.																								A series of schemes will soon be undertaken to ease traffic congestion at the entry points of roads connecting the city with the Bypass, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya assured commuters on Wednesday.																								First up, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority will undertake a project to relocate a large number of shops near bridge no. 4 at Park Circus. According to Bhattacharya, a market complex will soon be constructed on a vacant plot close to the bridge, where the evicted shops will be relocated.																								The government also has plans to widen Canal East Road and Canal West Road, along the Beleghata canal, to ensure faster traffic flow to and from the Bypass. After the two roads are widened, the banks of the canals will be repaired and a beautification scheme undertaken.

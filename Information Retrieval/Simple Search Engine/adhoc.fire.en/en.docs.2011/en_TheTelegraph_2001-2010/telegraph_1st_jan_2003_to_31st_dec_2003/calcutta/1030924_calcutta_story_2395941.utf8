																																																		Undertrial prisoner Gobinda Bera attempted suicide on Monday night by smashing a television set in a Howrah jail and stabbing himself in the stomach with a shard of broken glass. Police said Bera was remanded in judicial custody on Monday after his arrest on charges of dacoity and murder in Shibpur a few days ago. He seemed depressed after his arrest and, while being escorted to his cell on Monday, suddenly smashed the screen of the television set and tried to stab himself. He was rushed to Howrah Hospital, where doctors say his condition is still serious, as the wound is deep. Howrah district magistrate S. Kishore confirmed the suicide attempt. The jailer has sent a detailed report to the district authorities, but I have not received a copy yet, he said.

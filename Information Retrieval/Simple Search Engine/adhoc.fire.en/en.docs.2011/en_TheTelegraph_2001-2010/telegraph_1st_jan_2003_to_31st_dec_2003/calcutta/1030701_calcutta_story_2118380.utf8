 A STAFF REPORTER																								A 58-year-old former central government employee was arrested on charges of duping a number of young men with false promises of jobs. Officials of Muchipara police station caught the accused red-handed on Monday in central Calcutta, while he was swindling another jobless youth.																								The arrest was made within 48 hours of our receiving a specific complaint, said Naseem Ali, officer-in-charge of Muchipara police station. The accused had promised several unemployed youngsters of a job in a central government office and collected several lakhs from them.																								Police said Ugan Rabidas, the accused, took voluntary retirement in 2001. He proceeded to his ancestral house in Jharkhand, where he spent three months. He started the con racket on returning to the city.																								Police started zeroing in on Rabidas after receiving a complaint from Sunil Dey on June 28. Dey, 26, had said in his complaint that Rabidas, father of three sons, had promised him a central government job and taken several thousands from him.																								He pretended he was a retired officer who knew a number of officials involved in recruitment, Dey added.																								Armed with Deys complaint, a team of policemen started action. We first gathered Rabidas whereabouts. During the course of investigation, we found that he was due to come to central Calcutta on Monday to collect money from another youth. Accordingly, we laid a trap for him, said officer-in-charge Ali.																								During interrogation, Rabidas admitted that he had started duping youth from October 2002. We have a list of 12 people from whom he took money against false promises, added Ali. Even after his arrest, Rabidas tried to hoodwink the police. He initially claimed that he lived in Salt Lakes BK block. We sent a team there to verify his address, which turned out to be false, said Ali.																								During sustained interrogation, Rabidas broke down and disclosed his real address  Mahajatinagar, in Birati, on the citys northern fringe. He had rented a house there and lived with his wife and three sons. We searched his house and seized some documents, including his bank passbook,said an official of Muchipara thana. 																								The other people Rabidas had duped will be interrogated to find out the exact amount he had collected from them. His bank account is being verified and the police feel the figure will touch several lakhs.

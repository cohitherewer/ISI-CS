 Monday, December 29, 2003 				 Education for a million kids by 2008
 A STAFF REPORTER																								More than 13 crore of the 18 crore Indian children are prisoners of illiteracy. To try and right this wrong, Round Table India, with its 155 member-clubs, has embarked on a Freedom Through Education (FTE) initiative, which pledges education for one million children by 2008, involving an outlay of Rs 180 crore.																								The 11 clubs in Calcutta, with its 155 members, have taken a very pro-active role in this national project, according to Rajesh Agarwal, chairman, Area IV of the Table.																								We have built 15 schools in and around the city, under the FTE banner, in the past four years, at a cost of Rs 4 crore, imparting education to 5,000 children. Four more are in the pipeline, he said.																								Area IV is also in dialogue with the state education ministry to set up a Rs 50-lakh school in Calcutta as part of the Centres Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan by July 2004.																								Among its various fund-raising activities in the city, the Royal Bengal Corporate Quiz and the Shiv Khera shows have been hits. A big HRD-based fund-raiser is being planned for 2004 as a twinning initiative with the Round Table of the Netherlands.																								Area IV also sponsors accident insurance for 180 children, to the tune of Rs 90 lakh, at the Helen Keller Institute of Deaf and Dumb, besides a continuous feeding programme at Nirmala Kennedy Centre for 600 destitute children and women run by Mother Teresa Home.																								City Tablers have also been associated with Sister Cyrils education project for streetchildren and distributed audio tapes of nursery rhymes with lyrics in Braille to visually-impaired children. With the focus on education, the Table is the highest per capita spender among all social service organisations (around Rs 50,000 per member per annum), says Gautam Jatia, convener, publicity, Area IV.

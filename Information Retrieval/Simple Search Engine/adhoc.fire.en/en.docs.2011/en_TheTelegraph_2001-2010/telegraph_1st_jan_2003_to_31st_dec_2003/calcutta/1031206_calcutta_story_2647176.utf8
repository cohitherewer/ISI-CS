The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, December 06, 2003 				 Blame rerun in BC Roy report
 SUNANDO SARKAR AND MITA MUKHERJEE The probe into one of the biggest  health scandals in recent times has finally been concluded  and the prime suspects who have gone about their healthcare  duties without a hitch at another address for so long, have,  officially, been nailed.																								The team set up by the government to probe the circumstances that led to the string of baby deaths at BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children in August and September 2002, has finished its assignment. Fifteen months after the first of the deaths occurred, the 10-page report has reached Writers Buildings.																								But there is nothing in the report, submitted on November 28, that explains why the committee  led by three officials of the rank of joint secretary  took so long to file it. All it does is state that the five found prima facie guilty of the deaths were really responsible for the all-round mismanagement and failure to stem the rot.																								With the probe committee taking its own time to establish the guilt of the five found prima facie guilty, they have been leading normal professional lives. Transferred out of the states apex referral hospital for children  after the government spent some time, trying (without success) to show that nothing was wrong with the system  they soon found that punishment meant nothing more.																								The five to have been found guilty by the probe are  																								*BC Roy superintendent Anup Kumar Mandal																								*RMO Samar Kumar Das																								*Nurse-in-charge Ekadashi Sarkar																								*Store-keeper Asutosh Ray																								*Ward-master Swapan Kumar Ray.																								Other health department officials, however, were not so sure of the blame game. All five are just plain unlucky for being at the wrong place at the wrong time, they said.																								Mandal, Das and Sarkar  found guilty of dereliction of duty  just happened to be the superintendent, the RMO and the nurse-in-charge during a period when the number of deaths shot up, they explained.																								And the store-keeper (found guilty of not requisitioning enough oxygen cylinders and medicines) could not be blamed as repeated requests  from the hospital to the government  to make these supplies less irregular were ignored before the multiple deaths, officials claimed.																								But the most bizarre blame  of not being able to handle bereaved families  was pinned on the door of the ward-master, they said. How can a single person control a grieving and unreasonable mob? one official asked.																								The director of medical education, the senior-most physician in charge of these hospitals, was in no mood to offer explanations.																								All that Chittaranjan Maiti would say on Friday was that the report had reached the government. He added that the probe established the guilt of the five suspects. The report has been filed by senior officials and I should not comment on their findings, said Maiti.																								Declining comment on what the government would do with the report, Maiti said: Its not for me to say. A decision  involving his superiors in the department  would be taken in due course.																								Would that mean 15 months or less?

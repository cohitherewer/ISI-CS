 															- One-stop show for the perfect trousseau A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Alpa Poddar (left) and Divya Gurwar explain what Bridal Asia is all about. Picture by Pabitra Das																								Those overwhelmed by wedding chaos will soon have a one-stop destination. For all in search of the perfect trousseau, a two-day show will be travelling from the Capital to Calcutta on January 31. Bridal Asia, showcasing designer wear, jewellery and household products, will be held at the Taj Bengal, with a fashion show on January 29 at the Oberoi Grand to give Calcuttans a sneak peak of whats in store.																								The show that has made its mark in Delhi has ventured out of town for the first time. Though most dismiss the Calcutta fashion market as not worthy of investment, Divya Gurwara, behind the four-year-old exhibition, feels Calcuttas time has come.																								There is a demand for things that are not easily available in Calcutta, explains the now Delhi-based young woman who spent part of her childhood in this city. She is not afraid that the buyers will disappoint, either. One cant always wait for the market to be in full bloom. Sometimes we have to help it grow, adds Gurwara.																								The Calcutta line-up includes Ritu Kumar, Bhairavi Jaikishen, Vinita Pittie and Pramod Shah in the garments segment. The fashion event for the sub-continent also includes Moheen Khan from Bangladesh and Nomi Ansari from Pakistan. 																								The participants from the jewellery sector include a range  from Calcuttas Nemichand Bamalwa (always a huge draw in Delhi), to diamonds by Rakyan, and kundan and meenakari work from M.P. Rawat.																								With the Delhi event growing over the years to include over 90 participants, this is a small opening for the city. Gurwara has joined hands with Alpa Poddar, who has been providing insights into Calcutta tastes. And the advice was not to put together a conservative collection. Calcutta wants a variety of things, this is a market that understands both tradition and the trendy, explains Alpa.																								Whether the market is down or not, Gurwara has no fear about dipping demand. This is one market that is recession-proof. Indians will always get married and always overspend, she laughs.

 Koel Purie: A star is born  			This debut short feature film by director Ashvin Kumar tells the story of a chance encounter between a terrorist and a beauty queen in the wilderness of Ladakh. The film features well-known stage, television and film actor Irfan Khan, and Koel Purie, who recently graduated from The Royal Academy of Theatre Arts (RADA), London, and was seen in her debut feature, Everybody Says I am Fine. This is her second film since. At once hilarious and sinister, bizarre and moving, psychedelic and intensely real, Road to Ladakh is a short piece that takes on standard themes of sex and violence and treats them in a manner that puts this movie in a genre of its own. The music for the film has been composed and recorded by Susmit Sen, who, with his group, Indian Ocean, was recently invited to play at the Edinburgh Festival. The film has been produced by Shomit Mitter. The British Council hosts a screening of the film in the city which will be followed by a short interactive session with the director.																								When: Tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Nandan II

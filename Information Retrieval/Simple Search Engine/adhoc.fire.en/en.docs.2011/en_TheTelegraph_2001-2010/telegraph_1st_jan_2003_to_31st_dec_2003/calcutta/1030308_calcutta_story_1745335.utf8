 Saturday, March 08, 2003 				 Contempt plea in Saha death case
 R. VENKATARAMAN IN NEW DELHI																								A special leave petition seeking contempt action against West Bengal Medical Council president Ashok Choudhury and registrar Dilip Kumar Ghosh has been moved in the Supreme Court. The petitioner, US-based doctor Kunal Saha, has sought contempt action on grounds that the report of the Medical Councils ethical committee on the death of his wife, Anuradha, had not been made available to him.																								The petition will come up for hearing in another week or two. 																								Anuradha Saha, also a US- based doctor, died in Calcutta on May 28, 1998, due to medical negligence when the couple had come to their hometown on a short visit. Physicians Sukumar Mukherjee and Baidyanath Halder have already been convicted for the negligence and their appeal against the conviction is pending.																								However, as the apex body for doctors in the state, the Medical Council, after conducting an inquiry, did not even bother to make available to him a copy of its ethical committee report, claimed petitioner Kunal Saha.

 Wednesday, January 08, 2003 				 BE College in certificate row
 TAPAS GHOSH																								The father of an ex-student of Shibpurs Bengal Engineering College (Deemed University) has moved Calcutta High Court, alleging that the college authorities were refusing to issue a certificate to his son, who passed his masters in computer engineering from the institute in 1999.																								Prafulla Majumdar, the petitioner, has also pleaded before the court to appoint a committee to inquire into the matter and furnish a report as early as possible. Justice A.K. Mitra of Calcutta High Court will hear the case in the next few days.																								Petitioners counsel Supradip Roy said Diptiman, the ex-student, got admission in the institute for a four-year course in 1996. In early 1999, he sat for the fifth and sixth semesters and got the final marksheet in July 1999. On the basis of the final marksheet, Diptiman applied for a job in South Africa and joined service on August 2, 1999. He was in that country till March 2000, when a convocation was held on the B.E. College campus, Roy said.																								The certificate that was issued to Diptiman at the convocation mentioned 2000 as the year in which he passed the final examination, Roy said.																								When my son refused to accept the certificate, the controller of examinations directed him to submit the certificate for rectification, said Prafulla Majumdar, a resident of Behala. But instead of issuing a fresh certificate, the university authorities are pressuring my son to submit the final marksheet to them. 																								Recently, the controller of examinations issued a letter stating that the college authorities had issued the final marksheet by mistake, said the petitioners counsel. 																								The authorities say that Diptiman had passed in 2000, and not in 1999. Moreover, they are also claiming that he took the fifth and sixth semesters in January 2000, but, in fact, he was then living in South Africa, Roy explained, adding the institutes act has lowered Diptimans dignity abroad. The company in which he is working now intends to see his certificate, which he cant submit.																								No B.E. College official was available for comment.

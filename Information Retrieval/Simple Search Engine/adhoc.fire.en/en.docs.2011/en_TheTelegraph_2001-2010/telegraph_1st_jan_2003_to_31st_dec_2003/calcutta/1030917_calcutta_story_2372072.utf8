The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 Third day of go-slow trains
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Movement of trains to and from Howrah was irregular for the third day, following the revamp of the route relay interlocking system. Passengers were inconvenienced on Tuesday as trains ran around two hours behind schedule after being stranded between Liluah and Howrah, holding up departures as well.																								No EMU locals had been cancelled on Tuesday and only the Kamrup Passenger had to be rescheduled, said an Eastern Railway spokesperson. The special alternative train service between Burdwan and Sealdah via Naihati was also plying.																								Movement will be disturbed for about a week, warned officials, due to frequent point failure in the new system. People have to go through some trouble if they expect an improved system, said transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.

 Friday, December 05, 2003 				 Gang pulls off twin heists
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Twin armed dacoities early on Thursday triggered panic among residents of Sonarpur, on the southern fringes of the city. Police suspect the same gang is involved in both operations and have launched a hunt. 																								Six armed men broke into the Kamrabad residence of an elderly couple and robbed them at gunpoint. Ajit Dey, 60, a former businessman, and his wife, Gopa, woke up at around 2.30 am to find their bed surrounded by six dacoits, their faces hidden behind cloth, a local police official said. The Deys are known to be very courageous and they tried to avert the dacoity. Gopa was hit on the face with a revolver butt to force her to hand over the keys to her almirah, the official said. 																								The six left the house half an hour later with Rs 5,000 in cash, five gold chains, a few watches and other gold ornaments. Deys daughter lives in the US and most of the items were gifts from her, police said.																								Another dacoity was reported from a cellphone shop in the neighbouring area. We suspect the same group cut open the metal shutters of the shop and took away more than 20 handsets that were on display at the counters, the official added.																								Rajesh Kumar Singh, additional superintendent (industrial) of South 24-Parganas, confirmed that the two robberies were carried out by the same group.

 Friday, October 24, 2003 				 Delving into the pre-historic world
																								Ganesh C. Basu is a familiar name in the city art circuit, not only because he is a promising artist but because he is a versatile freelance writer whose works are published regularly in various newspapers and periodicals. An exhibition showcasing the recent works of Ganesh C Basu and two other talented artists, Bidula Basu and Puspita Ray, is interesting becuase the artists interpretation of familiar surroundings and subjects are varied and lend a new insight. Ganesh C. Basus acrylic and water colours of human figures, animals and even nature are done in abstract. His style is executed with a high degree of technical finesse. He is inspired by rock and cave paintings. Folk and tribal cult figures inspire him too. These are used in his works like leit motif. Bidulas water colours and acrylics are charming for their simplicity. Realistic in style and technically flawless, Bidula is inspired by Indian mythology and the spiritual aspect of Indian philosophy. Puspitas works are appealing for their freshness.																								When: Till October 26; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, , North Gallery

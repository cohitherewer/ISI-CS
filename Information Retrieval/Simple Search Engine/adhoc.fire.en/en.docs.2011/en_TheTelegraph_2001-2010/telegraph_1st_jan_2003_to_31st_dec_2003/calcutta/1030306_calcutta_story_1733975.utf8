The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Dristikanya
  Dristikanya is the story of a woman who regains her vision. Her new-found sight not only disturbs her, but it upsets and terrifies the world around her. The people around her, whom she identifies as a cow, a dog, a bull or a machine, naturally react to her vision vehemently. But the dichotomy of the situation is that the people who she sees as animals or gadgets, actually begin to identify themselves with the roles thrust upon them. Eventually, she wears a pair of compromise lens and is accepted by all in her new avatar. But in the process, she loses her identity, her individuality and is reduced to an obedient doe. The play attacks scathingly all those two-faced evil characters who put on masks to harm society and destroy those who come in their nefarious way. Based on Daphne Du Mauriers short story, the play is written and directed by Indrasish Laharry. Chenamukh celebrates its 22nd anniversary with the 100th show of Dristikanya.When: Today at 6.30 pmWhere: Academy of Fine Arts  Copyright

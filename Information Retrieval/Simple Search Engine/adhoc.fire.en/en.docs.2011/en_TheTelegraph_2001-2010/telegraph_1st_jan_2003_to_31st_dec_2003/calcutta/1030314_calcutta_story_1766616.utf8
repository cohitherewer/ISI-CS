				 																																										lRPG netcom officials reiterated on Thursday that any pay channel could go off the air any moment for not paying their dues to broadcasters. The cash flow from the ground remains extremely poor and outstandings at old rates constitute nearly 80 per cent of the money we owe to various pay channels, said a Netcom official. The threat of a switch-off loomed even larger after parleys involving Netcom-affiliated operators and Zee-Turner officers during the day proved inconclusive. Zee-Turner has sought four-five days time to consider proposals for concessions mooted by Cable Operators Sangram Committee. The situation is grim and unless there is a quick and dramatic improvement in the cash flow situation, broadcasters could pull the plug on their fare, said the Netcom representative. All the major bouquets, including Star, Sony and ESPN-Star Sports, apart from Zee-Turner, have indicated to the service provider that they are not prepared to wait any further for their dues.				 																																										Three more people were arrested on Thursday in connection with the Baranagar case on Tuesday, in which a youth was killed while stopping two men from abducting a girl. Police said the arrested men were identified as Safiuddin Molla, Munia Mondal and Lal Mohammed, alias Laltu, all history-sheeters. 				 																																										To prevent any untoward incident during Muharram, city police have made elaborate security arrangements, deploying more than 14,000 policemen. In all, 155 Muharram processions have been allowed this year. About 50 sensitive zones have been identified, where extra precautinary measures will be taken.				 																																										There were demonstrations in front of electricity board offices across Howrah after the district reeled under power cuts on Thursday. According to the State Electricity Board, power supply was disrupted after Wednesdays storm uprooted several poles that support the wires. 				 																																										Trinamul Congress has called a 12-hour Khardah bandh on Friday to protest police failure to make any headway in a rape case. A local girl was allegedly raped on March 8. Police claimed that all those named in the FIR have been arrested.				 																																										Santosh Bagchi, who retired as senior assistant editor of The Telegraph, died in Calcutta on Thursday. He was 83. Bagchis association with the Ananda Bazar Patrika group started in 1965 when he joined Hindusthan Standard. He was a bachelor.				 																																										Vicky Kurmi was arrested on Wednesday night at his hideout in Lake Town. Police said Kurmi was an accomplice of Pandit, a goon who used to control the drug and extortion rackets in the area.

 Friday, December 12, 2003 				 Ad-vantage: zag while the others zig
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bachchan: Master misfit as investment adviser																								Communication with consumer connect. That  and not the most expensive celeb face  is what makes good advertising. The first day of Impact 360, this years version of the Advertising Club of Calcuttas annual awards, was the meeting place of minds specialising in just how to make this connection. In its 50th year, the oldest ad club in the country has focussed not just on creative talent, but on ads that work.																								Advertising is first and last about having fun  on screen and behind the scenes  according to adman Stanley Pinto, delivering the R.K. Sarkar Memorial lecture. If in doubt, ask the guys at Hutch, he said, whose latest ad campaign has stirred the viewer enough to push the price of pugs through the roof. The Hutch core is all about making life simpler, feels Chlorophylls Kiran Khalap, and if magic has been made, its because brand and ad are in harmony.																								At Impact, ending Friday, ad pros from across the country will weigh campaign merit, aided by the consumer resonance and impact score, measured by a pan-Indian survey. The shortlisted ads prove that any campaign with a famous face wont hit the spot. But with four starry PepsiCo ads amongst 13 FMCG nominations, its hard to deny glam appeal.																								Celebrity is like a steak. It has both meat and sizzle But some campaigns use just the sizzle, not the meat, feels Ram Ray of Response. So, Amitabh Bachchan is a master misfit for a brand like ICICI (who wants investment advice from a failure of a businessman?), but a bulls-eye for Parker Vector (we are reminded of his father, the poet).																								There is a distinction between ads using celebrities to endorse products and those connecting their human traits to them. Like in the Pepsi Kites ad, one of the nominees, Bachchan represents a man who cant be kept down, explains a spokesperson for JWT, Delhi, handling the account. Sachin Tendulkar is an obvious choice as the only youth icon in the country. Lays, another PepsiCo brand, launched the Saif and Kaif flavour during the World Cup. But JWT confesses that while Saif Ali Khan is a perfect fit with the image of the chip, Mohammed Kaif was handy as the names rhymed.																								Indiscriminate use of star power is a waste of money, as it adds no value, says Khalap. Case in point: the many ads featuring cricketers from abroad. Just because cricket is a religion, it is used. Clients will have to start doing work on what their brands stands for, suggests Khalap. Rays suggestion is to award risk-taking clients who understand the value of being able to zag while others are all zigging.																								The man who brought Lintas to Calcutta, Stanley Pinto, started a hilarious walk down nostalgia lane with a salute to the no-bullshit Bengali. Suhel Seth harped on the quality of the city that has contributed to the industry more than any other.

However, when told that Kanakchampa was a widow, Shashishekhar could not face reality. Despite having a thorough knowledge of anatomy, the physician was unable to accept the skeleton of Kanakchampa. Eventually, Kanakchampa poisoned both her beloved and herself to embrace death in the identity that society had bestowed upon her. This short story by Tagore has been dramatised by Kunal Mukhopadhyay and produced by Howrah Dakshinayan. Direction: Tapan Mukherjee and Kunal Mukhopadhyay.

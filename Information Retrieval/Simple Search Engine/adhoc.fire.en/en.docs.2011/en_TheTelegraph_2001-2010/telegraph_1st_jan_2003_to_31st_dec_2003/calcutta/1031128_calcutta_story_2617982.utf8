																								Come winter, and Calcutta is literally inundated with a spate of cultural programmes of all hues, besides the customary exhibitions and craft melas. But an organisation that has withstood the test of time and the onslaught of rapidly changing cultures, successfully celebrates its 11th anniversary this year. Rasikhapriya has carved a niche for itself for consistently promoting talented Carnatic musicians and bringing them to the city with unfailing regularity. This year, the programme, which is being inaugurated by none other than Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty, is peppered with the brightest gems of Carnatic music. It is T.N.Seshagopalans vocals on the first day (today), with able accompaniment by V.V. Ravi on the violin and Mannargudi Easwaran on the mridangam. The second day (29th) features Hyderabad Brothers, vocals by D.Seshachari and D. Raghavachari, and the third day stars vocals by Bombay Jayshri together with violin by M.S.N. Murthy and mridangam by Patri Satishkumar. 																								When: November 28 at 6.15 pm; November 29 amp; 30 at 5.30 pm																								Where: Uttam Mancha

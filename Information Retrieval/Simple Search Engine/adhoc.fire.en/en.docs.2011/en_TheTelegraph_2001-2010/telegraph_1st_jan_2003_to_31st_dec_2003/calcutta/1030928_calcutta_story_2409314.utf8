 Sunday, September 28, 2003 				 Blows from cops for joke
 A STAFF REPORTER																								When terrorists had attacked American Center two years ago, they had failed to fire a single shot in retaliation. But when a 30-year-old passerby expressed doubts about their firing power, the policemen on duty on Saturday evening promptly picked him up and assaulted him before handing him over to Shakespeare Sarani police station. The man was detained till late at night.																								While passing by American Center with a friend, Sheikh Nayan Mandal of Hooghly pointed at the guns being carried by the policemen and said those were ineffective. At this, the policemen came out from the bunker and picked him up.																								However, A.K. Das, security-in-charge of American Center, said Nayan was handed over to the police because he had passed lewd comments on the guards.

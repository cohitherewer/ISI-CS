 Thursday, November 13, 2003 				 Bollywood dream crumbles, teens return
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Their dreams of making it big in Bollywood ended in a quiet journey back home from Asansol.																								According to Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police (detective department), the six teenagers, who went missing from their Tiljala and Tangra homes on Monday, returned on Wednesday evening. They could not make it to Mumbai but stayed on in Asansol for a day. As they did not have enough money on them to travel further, they returned home, Mitra said.																								The boys, from the same neighbourhood  Subhankar Das, Sujoy Pal, Bapi Pramanik, Rabindranath Pramanik, Dipankar Saha and Tapan Pandit  left home for school as usual. All of them, except Bapi, are students of Sanat Roy School. Bapi studies in Sarat Sur School, a few blocks away. When they did not return home in the evening, their parents lodged missing diaries at Tangra and Tiljala police stations. Later in the evening, Subhankars mother, Manisha, found a note on her sons table. 																								It read: The six of us are leaving home for good. I had told you earlier that I dont like studying. We have planned to go to Mumbai and make it big there, with the help of one of my friends cousins, who works there. I will call you once we reach Mumbai.																								The boys had made a detailed plan of their getaway. We did not have any idea of his intentions, even on Monday morning, when he left home. Instead of taking books, he had crammed his satchel with clothes, said Rabindranaths father Ganesh.																								When Subhankar phoned his mother on Tuesday at around 3 pm, he told her not to worry, as they were safe. He claimed he was calling from Liluah. But sleuths, who had tapped the call, traced it to Asansol. By the time we could set out to get them, the boys had returned, Mitra added.

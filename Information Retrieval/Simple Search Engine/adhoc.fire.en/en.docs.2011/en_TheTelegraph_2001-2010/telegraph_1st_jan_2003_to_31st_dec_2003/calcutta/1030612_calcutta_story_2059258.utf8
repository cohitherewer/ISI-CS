 Thursday, June 12, 2003 				 Hologram drive in auto curbs
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The traffic department of the city police has decided to issue holograms to licensed auto-rickshaws. The traffic police, with assistance from the Regional Transport Authority (RTA), initiated the move a few months ago to curb errant autos and identify the illegal three-wheelers.																								M.K. Singh, deputy commissioner (traffic) said the hologram drive is unique. The holograms will be distributed from Thursday. We have fixed July 15 as the deadline for auto-drivers to collect the holograms. If any auto-rickshaw is found plying in the city without the hologram after that, we will impound the vehicle, Singh warned.																								Auto drivers who have a valid licence issued by the RTA will have to come to Vidyasagar traffic guard with all their original papers, like the route permit issued by the RTA and the driving licence. The hologram will be issued after the vehicle is checked and its papers are verified, Singh added. 																								A one-time fee of Rs 25 will be levied for the hologram. It will have to be pasted on the windscreen of the vehicle. The route and the engine number of the auto will be mentioned on the hologram, said Singh.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Criminal Mohammad Ahmed and constable M.K. Majhi were injured in an encounter between gangsters and cops at Golabari, in Howrah, on Sunday night. Ahmed was admitted to Howrah General Hospital, while Majhi is in a nursing home. Four members of Ahmeds gang managed to flee in the darkness, police said.																								Superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar said Majhi, of Golabari thana, was on his night patrol when he spotted a gang of four criminals walking down a narrow lane off B.L. Roy Road.																								Majhi jumped out of his jeep to intercept them. Two other constables in the rear of the vehicle joined him, Kumar said. The criminals took to their heels. They lobbed bombs at the jeep while they ran.																								The gang was chased through the bylanes. Majhi caught up with Ahmed and grabbed him by by his collar. Ahmed tripped and fell while Majhi struggled to keep his balance.																								Ahmed was carrying two bombs in his back pocket. They exploded as he fell, said one of the constables. There was a lot of smoke. We were forced to wait till it cleared, and then we saw Majhi and Ahmed on the ground, writhing in pain, he said.																								Superintendent Kumar later said Golabari police station will conduct a combing operation to identify the criminals who had escaped. Golabari police said Ahmed was convicted in five cases earlier and is wanted in eight cases of dacoity and murder.

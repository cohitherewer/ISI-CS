The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, November 19, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Road rights vs screen space
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should shooting of films be banned on city roads? More letters will be published next week				 Traffic stoppers:  Ajay Devgan and Simran on Vidyasagar Setu Anil Kumar Sen,
																		Ram Chandra Chatterjee Lane.																																																														Film-makers should spare a thought for the inconvenience caused to commuters and pedestrians when a major thoroughfare is blocked for a shoot. Traffic snarls are routine affairs and accidents are just waiting to happen. The growing trend of shooting at busy spots needs to be checked immediately.									

Prantik Sanyal,
																		S.P. Mukherjee Road.																																																														The citys roads can certainly be used for shooting a film, but why should common people bear the brunt? Theres no harm as long as commuters are not harried by the change in traffic routes.									

Ujjal Bhattacharyya,
																		Entally.																																																														Shooting of films on city roads should be banned during peak hours as it disrupts traffic. Calcutta cannot afford another reason for traffic congestion. Shooting of films, in most cases, require roadblocks, which force people to suffer unnecessary hardships. It is astonishing that the authorities can be so inconsiderate to peoples rights and interests. At times, after a shooting session is over, the entire area is littered with rubbish. The civic authorities do not hold anyone responsible, once again compromising ordinary people. Shooting on city roads can be restricted to certain times and places. Moreover, the film-makers should be given strict guidelines regarding cleanliness, with severe penalties for rule-breaking. The process should be scrutinised to keep things under control.									

Kajal Chatterjee,
																		Peerless Nagar.																																																														Canning film sequences on city roads must be banned as it throws traffic out of gear and paralyses normal life. Just like rallies, film shoots have a disastrous effect on office-goers, students and patients. The administration should ensure that the glitz and glamour do not overshadow the interests of common people.									

Debasish Chakraborty,
																		Nilmoni Mitra Row.																																																														A ban on shooting on the roads is essential. Along with film-makers, onlookers at the shooting site must also share the blame for crippling traffic movement. As soon as people get wind of a film crew at an outdoor location, they rush to the spot to get a glimpse of their idols, not realising that others are inconvenienced by this madness.									

Biman Saha,
																		Lake Town.																																																														Shooting should only be banned on arterial roads of the city. But as a lot of people are interested in the first-hand feel of film-making, shooting of movies can be permitted on stretches that do not disrupt traffic on the main streets, and on Sundays and other public holidays.									

Md Ayub,
																		Bright Street.																																																														Shooting should not be banned on city roads, because it will help boost the economic condition of Bengal. A lot of people who are not aware of the natural beauty of the state, be it the hill stations in the north or the Sunderbans in the south, may be tempted to visit it after seeing a film shot here. So, tourism could see a rise, profiting us all. Besides, if Bollywood starts shooting in Calcutta regularly, it will provide more opportunities for collaboration with Tollywood. There might be traffic problems, but that would be negligible.									

Sushma Jalan,
																		Alipore.																																																														Shooting of films should certainly be banned on city roads, as they create havoc and chaos all around. Not only do people throng to see the shooting, but traffic is disrupted and the public, as well as the film crew, are harassed. However, realistic cinema requires the essence of city life to recreate reality. Such films cannot be entirely shot in studios. Moreover, several countries are wooing our film-makers. The money spent on foreign locales is much better utilised on home ground. So once in a while, directors like Mani Rathnam should be granted permission to make award-winning movies. But shooting masala movies should certainly be banned on city roads to prevent the disruption of normal life.									

Prasanta Kumar Ghosh,
																		Barasat.																																																														Shooting on streets only adds to the existing chaos of cars, autos and two-wheelers. Even a decade ago, the roads were not as congested as they are now. Common people cant resist the lure of watching their icons in flesh. A crowd is bound to gather if a shoot takes place in the open, creating more bottlenecks.									

Neha Dokania,
																		Ashok Hall School.																																																														Shooting of films on city roads must certainly not be banned. People long to see how their icons look like in real life. Its a different experience altogether. Besides, a scene on the Howrah bridge will look artificial if the director tries to recreate it on the sets. Shooting a few scenes on the roads does not spark a major problem.									

Rajarshi Ghosh,
																		Khanpur Road.																																																														I think shooting of films must be banned on city roads, especially on weekdays as office-goers, schoolchildren and college students get stuck in jams for hours. Filming a few scenes can be allowed on holidays, when the traffic volume is considerably less. The authorities must strictly deal with the matter, or else it may soon spin out of control.									

RIMLI DATTA,
																		Salt Lake.																																																														Indian films are attracting global attention these days. The beautiful outdoor locations shown in the films will promote tourism and rake in revenue for the state. Besides, several local people get to earn some extra money when a film crew from outside camps in the city for a week or two.

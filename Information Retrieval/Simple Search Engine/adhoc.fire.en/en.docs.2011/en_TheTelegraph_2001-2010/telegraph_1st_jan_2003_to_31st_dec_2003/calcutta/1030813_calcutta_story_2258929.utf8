 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Water watchdog in arsenic fight
 BAPPA MAJUMDAR																								Alarmed at the high arsenic count in areas dotted with multi-storeyed buildings in the city, the government has set up a water watchdog.																								The Arsenic Task Force (ATF), the result of a Unicef collaboration with the state government to shield Calcuttans from the harmful effects of arsenic, aims to monitor safety steps taken by individual households.																								Comprising government agencies like the All-India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) and the Central Public Works Department, along with 20 NGOs, the task force will also coordinate moves by various state government departments against the arsenic menace.																								Recent studies have confirmed that Calcutta and its surrounding areas  particularly the zones in the south (Lake Gardens, Alipore and the Maidan area) which have a cluster of multi-storeyed buildings  now have arsenic-free water 150 metres below the surface.																								The danger, the authorities have warned, lies in that most highrises have deep tubewells, drawing water from less than 150 metres below ground level. Though the CMC and the state government have banned installation of deep tubewells in buildings under construction, most existing highrises continue to draw water from the arsenic-alarm levels.																								And in the citys fringe areas, like Sonarpur, Rajarhat, Barrackpore and Barasat, realtors are not reined in by any tubewell ban. It is here that we can play a vital role, ATF chairman K.J. Nath said on Tuesday.																								To start with, the task force will oversee the use of sealing agents on deep tubewells that are still being used. This sealant has to be applied on the surface of tubewells at depths between 20 and 80 metres, explained Nath. We have found that the most seepage of arsenic-contaminated water into deep tubewells occurs at this level. If the seepage takes place, the water below 150 metres also gets contaminated. 																								The ATF has also been asked to publicise the activities undertaken by the 20 arsenic-testing laboratories in town. These labs test samples of water for only Rs 100, but few know about them, observed Nath.																								Also on the ATF agenda is pushing arsenic-treatment units that can be fitted in individual homes and multi-storeyed buildings. The smaller units come for Rs 500 and the bigger plants cost anything between Rs 30,000 and Rs 1 lakh, said officials.																								State health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said the formation of the ATF symbolised a reiteration of the governments commitment to fight arsenic. Though tackling the arsenic menace is primarily the public health engineering departments responsibility, the health department will pitch in wherever required, insisted Mishra.

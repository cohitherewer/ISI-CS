The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 13, 2003 				 Friday evenings, take a breather at the bank
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 Bikram Ghosh performs with Amaan Ali Bangash. Ghosh will conduct an interactive session on the tabla with customers at Bancafe on Friday																								Fusion beats and fixed deposits under the same roof? Chilling out  not stressing out  at a bank?																								Starting Friday, banking and a breather will go hand and hand. At Bancafe, ABN AMROs newly-opened coffee shop at Camac Street, a series of fun events is set to keep star customers cool under the collar this sultry summer. Privileged clientele will be invited for evenings of entertainment, starting with an interactive session with Bikram Ghosh on June 13.																								The laid-back evening for around 35 invitees, 7.30 pm onwards, will be a world tour of rhythm, promises Ghosh. I plan to take the audience through a casual lecture-demonstration, starting with Indian rhythm, explains the tabla exponent.																								The speciality of traditional rhythms, the language of the tabla, that bols are not just a funky thing to say, will feature first. A comparison of world beats, with live demonstrations of Latin and Afro-Cuban rhythm, will follow. A short tabla recital, snippets of the kanjira, the pandeiro and different drumbeats reproduced on the handsonic are part of the line-up.																								This is the first in a sequence of get-togethers lined up at the caf, run by Barista on the Azimganj House premises from 7.30 pm, when the caf is cleared for users who prefer to bank at ease. The next function  one with a more back-to-business feel  has been lined up: An interactive talk with IIM professor Ranjan Das.																								The platform has been designed to popularise the Bancafe more than just a bank concept, which has been initiated in India, with branches already in Bangalore, Delhi and Noida.																								The events have been planned to appeal to different segments of customers, with their different interests in mind. So, music for those looking to relax  will share the stage with investment tips for those keen to optimise money-management, and even film talk, as cinema is close to the Calcuttans hearts.

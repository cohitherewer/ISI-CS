The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, January 29, 2003 				 																				sakti ranjan Sengupta								Member, executive body, Jodhpur Park Residents Association																																							These days individuals do not have the guts to raise their voice in protest as there is no one behind them. This has made the existence of citizens groups necessary. But there is no need to give more power to these groups than what they already have. For if they are not conscious enough, the move can have damaging results. Citizens groups should supplement the work of the police, as our association does in our locality. If our night guards raise an alarm, personnel from the local police station always rush to the spot and take action.

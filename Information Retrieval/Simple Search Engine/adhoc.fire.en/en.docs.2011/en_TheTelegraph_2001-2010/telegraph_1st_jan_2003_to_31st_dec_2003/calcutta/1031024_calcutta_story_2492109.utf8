 Friday, October 24, 2003 				 Road drive spells doom for 410 trees
 JAYANTA BASU				 	 One of the trees felled to widen the road in front of Modern High School. Picture by Aranya Sen																								Till yesterday, they were standing tall, casting a soothing shadow on the pavement in front of Modern High School. Today, they lie there uprooted, hacked and trussed up.																								Midnight mayhem has robbed the entire Gariahat Road stretch leading to Park Circus of its greenery, with around 60 to 70 trees falling to a road-widening drive. And this is just the beginning, with the claim of compensatory plantation  five for each uprooted tree  bordering on the absurd.																								We have got permission for cutting about 410 large and small trees for widening the roads, under package IV from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB). We have so far cut around 60 to 70, said S.R. Banerjee, vice-chairman, Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC).																								The HRBC, which hosted a celebrated tree-planting ceremony about a month ago, has embarked on a Calcutta Traffic Improvement Development project that promises development of traffic management, but spells doom for the green cover from Gariahat to Park Circus, New Park Street, Mullickbazar to Rawdon Street, Southern Avenue to Gariahat Road (South).																								According to pollution control board sources, a tree-cutting committee, appointed by the high court, gives the permission to chop after applications are scrutinised by the directorate of forest utilisation. Sumana Bhattacharya, forest utilisation officer who is also convener of the high court-appointed committee, confirms that the HRBC has been given the permission on the condition that it will plant five trees for felling one.																								But Bhattacharya is clueless about where these saplings could possibly be planted. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) will have to provide the area, she adds.																								The CMC, meanwhile, remains in the shade. We have just received some complaints and I have asked our people to look into the matter immediately, says member, mayor-in-council (parks and gardens) Hridayananda Gupta. All these trees are CMC property. How on earth can the contractor fell them? he demands. Its in the contract and the contractor (in this case, Tantia construction company) has the right to chop those trees, counters HRBC vice-chairman Banerjee.																								Greenery chop charge																								This is echoed by S. Roy, senior vice-president of Tantia construction 																								company.																								But the contractual right to chop has not managed to stifle the 																								green lobby. quot;Greenery has vanished from vast stretches of Gariahat 																								Road, near the Ice Skating Rink and Modern High School, as well as 																								from CIT Road. The entire area has been devastated by the loss, quot; 																								laments Bonani Kakkar of People United for Better Living In Calcut																								ta (PUBLIC), who has already shot off a letter to the CMC in this re																								gard. quot;The citys roads do need to be widened, but the authorities 																								could have carried out the drive with a little bit of compassion, quot; adds 																								Kakkar, who is contemplating taking the legal route if required.																								Senior CMC officials, meanwhile, complained that though the 																								tree-chopping permission has come with the condition that the 																								HRBC would have quot;to explore the possibility of translocating the 																								valuable and slow-growing trees quot;, the critical how, when and where 																								questions remain unanswered.																								 quot;We have not yet translocated any tree. CMC experts are identify																								ing the trees to be removed to some other spot, quot; say senior Tantia of																								ficials. quot;The 30 to 40 medium and large trees in the Gariahat region 																								that have already been felled were impossible to be translocated due 																								to their enormous size, quot; feel HRBC officials. Some more large trees 																								adjacent to Modern High School should be chopped before the school 																								reopens next week, say field workers at the spot.																								Plant physiology expert Subhendu Mukherjee says the labour 																								and other costs incurred in translocating large trees are very high. 																								 quot;Moreover, one needs a high degree of technical expertise to do the 																								work properly, quot; he adds.

 Monday, March 10, 2003 				 Tagore binds his campuses
 TAMAL SENGUPTA																								It is a cultural bond that unites Centre-run Visva-Bharati and state-controlled Rabindra Bharati University (RBU). The campuses have, for the first time, agreed in principle to share cultural and academic excellence since their inception. 																								On Wednesday, both the universities will organise a joint cultural function on the Jorasanko campus of the RBU in Calcutta. Vice-chancellors of both universities will attend, along with musician V. Balsara, who will be the chief guest of the function.																								Both universities are engaged in spreading Tagores works in their respective ways. But now, we have decided to work together and share our knowledge and experience, said Santosh Kumar Ghorui, RBU registrar.																								Vice-chancellors of the two universities  Sujit Kumar Basu and Bharati Mukherjee  have already held a discussion on the cooperative effort some time ago. Later, registrars Ghorui and Sunil Sarkar met to chalk out the joint programmes. Wednesdays function at Jorasanko will be our first joint venture. Such functions will be organised jointly by teachers and students of the two universities, said Ghorui.																								It is likely that both universities will observe Tagores birthday on May 9 in Calcutta by organising joint functions. 																								Informed sources said Visva-Bharati had responded to RBUs call for holding joint cultural functions and sharing of knowledge and experience after its copyright on Tagores works ended in 2000. 																								Many publishers and printers have started publishing Tagores works from last year, as there is no copyright now. Both the universities realised that the time was ripe for them to work together to carry on the legacy of Tagores works.

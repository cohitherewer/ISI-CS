The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, August 14, 2003 				 Of virtual reality
Art is an extension of the artists impression of his/her universe as he/she visualises and interprets it. Sukanta Das sees the world around him through the prism of virtual reality and his paintings, despite the apparent realism they depict, are steeped in a different plane  a neo-realistic world. The crumbling world of the aristocratic Bengali families inspires him to weave a colourful tapestry of imaginative stories. The dilapidated structures in the background of his frames seem to suck the central characters into their vortex and the effect is dramatic. Das works seem like depiction of a surreal world, and the characters, almost eerie and mesmeric in their presence, are stuck in a time frame beckoning viewers to take a second glance. Their body languages seem to express their unfulfilled dreams and aspirations, their joys and sorrows and take us through a nostalgic journey into the past. We are all very familiar with Das subjects, but he adds a twist to his tale and takes us all through a journey of discovery.																								When: Till August 17; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery

 Thursday, September 11, 2003 				 Witness blot on braveheart
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Two of the prime witnesses in the Bapi Sen murder case  the taxi-driver and his helper  who had earlier turned hostile, have now alleged that the police sergeant was obviously drunk and that he stumbled and fell while trying to hail the cab.																								During Wednesdays cross-examination, driver Mewalal Gupta and helper Madhukanta Yadav, while referring to Sen as a tottering man who had tried to stop the taxi, went on to allege that they were being pressurised into giving statements against the five arrested constables, accused of battering Bapi to death.																								Police, however, remained unfazed by the allegations hurled by the duo at the sergeant who gave his life trying to save a girl from the clutches of the rogue constables, on the last night of 2002. 																								Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner, detective department, stressed that the evidence against the accused members of the reserve force was very strong.																								Gupta and Yadav had earlier turned and went back on their statements recorded in the chargesheet filed by the detective department. 																								During cross-examination by defence lawyers Bishnu Charan Ghosh and Naba Kumar Ghosh, the duo claimed that some policemen had come calling at their houses on Tuesday and asked them to stick to their statements recorded in the chargesheet, against the constables.																								The cross-examination of witnesses will continue on Thursday.

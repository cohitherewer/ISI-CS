		 Traffic congestion is  a regular feature on BT Road at Dunlop Bridge. Picture  by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryChittaranjan Sadhukhan: BT Road, at the Dunlop junction, remains a motorists nightmare for a greater part of the day.																																																													Youre right. Till a few days ago, it was impossible to negotiate the crossing. The place was always chock-a-block with auto-rickshaws, taxis and Matador vans. We talked to the auto union and shifted the stand to a permanent spot to ease the traffic jam. Similar steps were taken with regard to the taxis and Matadors. Now, we have installed a signalling system, too. However, the problem cannot be resolved entirely because the PWD Road that leads towards Dakshineswar from BT Road is not as wide as the latter.

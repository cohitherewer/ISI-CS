 BAPPA MAJUMDAR				 	 Parichay: True grit																								Four months ago, after a near-fatal accident, the 19-year-old engineering student could not recognise his parents or the alphabets and could only mumble a few words. Today, he is back at Behrampore Engineering and Technology College to sit for his third semester examination.																								For Parichay Pal, this has been a chapter straight out of a believe-it-or-not series, scripted by dedicated doctors, dollops of determination and a generous dose of support from family and friends.																								On August 21, the engineering student and guitarist was returning to his Salt Lake home after a gig, when a speeding truck knocked him down from behind. He suffered, among other injuries, a bad blow to the brain.																								Parichay was first rushed to a local nursing home, where a CT scan confirmed serious head injuries. He was then rushed to AMRI Apollo Hospital in a deeply unconscious state. The next CT scan revealed severe brain haemorrhage. We immediately wheeled him into the operating theatre for a brain surgery to remove the clots and also repair the damage to the brain circuit, says neurosurgeon Amitabha Chanda. The operation was successful, but Parichay had lost all intellectual functions.																								We were completely at our wits end, says Parichays father Prasanta Pal, an employee of the state health department. We just pleaded with the doctors to save him. With the help of a neuro-psychiatrist, Chanda put Parichay on sustained medication and counselling, to cure the physical injury and combat the mental trauma.																								Two weeks ago, the neurosurgeon found that Parichays condition had improved significantly. He was remembering things and beginning to read. He gave me a call and said that he would be sitting for his exams this week. I was thrilled, says Chanda.																								As soon as he started feeling better, Parichay voiced his determination to be back in college. Dada (Parichay) started insisting that he would not drop a semester. The doctors advised him to take it easy, but there was no stopping him, says sister Payel, a student of Class XI.																								Parichays classmates in Behrampore are helping him prepare for the exams and also to overcome his speech impairment. Back at the Pal residence in Salt Lakes DD Block, the fact that Parichay is sitting for his exams  and even strumming his favourite tunes on the guitar  seems nothing short of a miracle.

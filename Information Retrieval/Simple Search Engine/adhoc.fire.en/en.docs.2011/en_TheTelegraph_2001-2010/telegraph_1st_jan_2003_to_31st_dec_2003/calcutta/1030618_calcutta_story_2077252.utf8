	Every day, one or two trucks loaded with LPG cylinders  are illegally parked in front of Kalighat Park. The agents  unload the trucks by flinging the cylinders on the road,  from where delivery boys collect them. This is done without  any regard for safety norms. Even if a single gas cylinder  bursts, the magnitude of the consequences will be tremendous.  The authorities must realise the potential hazard of around  150 cylinders rolling on the road. Unloading of LPG cylinders  must be done in a secure way.

	The authorities of a public library in Behalas Unique  Park felled a coconut tree in the name of construction.  The Behala police, whom we had informed of the library committees  intention, initially prevented the members from doing so  and directed them to obtain permission from the Calcutta  Municipal Corporation. But the moment the cops left, the  library authorities chopped the tree. We contacted the police  but they did not pay heed any more. 
	 S. Kar, Behala.

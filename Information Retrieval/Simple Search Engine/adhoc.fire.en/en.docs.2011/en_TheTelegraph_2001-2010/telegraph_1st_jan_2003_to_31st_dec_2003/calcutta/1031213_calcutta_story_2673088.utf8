 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 Water scarce as main pipe springs a leak
 OUR CORRESPONDENT				 	 Waterworld off Tallah bridge. Picture by Amit Datta																								Residents of vast stretches in north and central Calcutta faced a water crisis on Friday after an underground water pipe sprung a leak near Tallah bridge in the morning. Many roads in Shyambazar and Bagbazar were flooded with the water that gushed out of the leak. The situation worsened as engineers of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) failed to plug the leak till late in the afternoon. Mayoral council member Sovan Chattopadhyay said the leak had sprung in the 30-inch-diameter main pipe.																								Residents of Tallah complained that water from the leak clogged the areas roads for several hours since early on Friday. In some pockets, the water stood knee-deep and office-goers and students had to wade through it to reach their destinations.																								Supply of filtered water remained suspended throughout the day in many areas as a result of the leak. Adequate steps have been taken to plug the leak as early as possible, assured mayoral council member Chattopadhyay, adding that the supply of filtered water was likely to be restored by Friday night.																								Officials of Tallah pumping station, however, said the repairs are not likely to be completed before Saturday. We can ensure normal supply of water only after that, they added. 																								 Sources in the CMC said prolonged waterlogging had caused severe damage to a long stretch of K.K Banerjee Road and its adjacent lanes. Tapas Basu, assistant engineer, water supply, said a portion of the road had caved in under the water.																								Borough IV chairman Salil Chatterjee said a defect had been detected in the pipe two months ago, but no action had been taken by the CMC to plug the leak.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								After several broken promises, the Salt Lake municipality is eyeing road repairs, though partial. Although the civic body announced that it would take up road repairs before Pujas 2002, lack of bitumin supply and a shortage of funds prevented it from doing so, officials said.																								We will place orders for 30 tonnes of bitumin with the West Bengal Small-Scale Industries Development Corporation, a municipality officer said. Repairs will start soon, he added.																								However, municipality executive officer Baidyanath Mandal said the municipality will take up patchwork repairs only, because of a funds crunch. The lanes and bylanes will be repaired, but no major work can be taken up, Mandal said on Friday.																								The municipality repairs most of the lanes and bylanes within the blocks, while the thoroughfares, including Broadway, the crossroads and the roads of Sector V, are maintained by the urban development department and CMDA.																								The municipality has requested the CMDA to repair Crossroad I, as we do not have adequate funds to maintain it, added executive officer Mandal.

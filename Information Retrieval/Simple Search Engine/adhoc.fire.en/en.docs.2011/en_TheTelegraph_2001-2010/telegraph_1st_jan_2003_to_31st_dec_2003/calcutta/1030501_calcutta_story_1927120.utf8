 Thursday, May 01, 2003 				 Park Street trader knifed, body left on Bypass
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Middle-aged trader Mohammad Jasmin was knifed to death and his body dumped in a bush opposite Science City, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, on Wednesday morning.																								Tiljala police later raided three places in central and east Calcutta and arrested two men named in the first information report filed by Jasmins family. Officers investigating the case said they are not sure about the motive behind the murder.																								Police said Jasmin ran a small-time electrical and car repair service on Park Street, near Mullickbazar. He lived with his family in a two-room, ground-floor apartment in a narrow lane not far from his workplace.																								According to son Mohammad Sarfaraz, five men arrived in a Tata Sumo around 9 pm on Tuesday and parked the car on Park Street. 																								Two of them knocked at our door. My father recognised both and they tried to persuade him to accompany them to the car. In spite of his reluctance, my father went with them. He told us he would be back in a few minutes, Sarfaraz recounted.																								But Jasmin did not. After midnight, his family went looking for him at the shop and at friends houses. Then, at 2 am, a jeep from Tiljala police station arrived with the news that a body with multiple injuries and a purse in the hip pocket had been found near Science City. 																								 I rushed with my elder brother and identified my fathers body at the police station, Sarfaraz said. He told the police the names of the two men who had come to pick up his father. Police sent Jasmins body for post-mortem. The two arrested men were produced in court and remanded in police custody.

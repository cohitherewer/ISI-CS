 Sunday, October 19, 2003 				 Killed in bid to save pregnant wife from goons
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In a deadly and deliberate attack, a 28-year-old caretaker of a house under construction in Salt Lake was shot dead by four armed miscreants when he resisted them from abducting his pregnant wife. The goons also stabbed the deceaseds wife. She is now fighting for life at Nilratan Sirkar Medical College and Hospital. No arrests have been made.																								According to preliminary investigation, the attack was planned. The miscreants came to abduct the woman. They were also prepared to kill the caretaker, said an officer.																								According to police, the incident occurred around 2.30 am in the EE block under Bidhannagar (east) police station. The goons, armed with revolvers and choppers, went straight to the room where caretaker Bikash Karmakar and his wife Deepa were sleeping.																								On hearing the noise, Bikash woke up. But the goons hit him on the head with an iron rod, said Ajay Nand, additional superintendent of police, Salt Lake. 																								As Bikash slumped to the floor, two of the gangsters started beating him up. The other two pounced on Deepa, in the sixth month of pregnancy, and dragged her out of the room.																								On seeing the condition of his wife, Bikash made a grab at one of the gangsters. Sensing trouble, one of them fired at him from close range. Bikash died on the spot as the bullet pierced his chest, said an official of Bidhannagar (east) police station.																								By then Deepa had started screaming. The attackers realised it would not be possible to abduct her. They stabbed her repeatedly till she fell unconscious, and walked out.																								The miscreants apparently were in a hurry to leave. They fled leaving the revolver behind. But soon, two of them returned and collected it, said the official.																								As the miscreants fled, local residents informed the police. There are stab wounds all over the womans body. Her condition is critical, he said.																								According to police, the miscreants were known to the couple. Bikash recently fell out with them. The goons wanted to use a portion of the house, but he was unwilling to let them do so. They started disturbing Deepa and would pass lewd comments at her. Last week, Bikash had warned the gangsters not to come to his house, said a police officer. A search has been started to track down the culprits.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, June 12, 2003 				 Ghoosh
Immanuel Kant had said, There is no moral holiday in life. This is illustrated humorously in Kunal Mukhopadhyays serio-comic drama, Ghoosh (Bribe). Bribe doesnt always come in straight, simple form. Bribery is an art and bribe often appears camouflaged in various forms and changes colours like a chameleon. It often has an innocent and innocuous approach. But once it gets entry in an opportune moment, it spreads its tentacles like a cancer and spoils the peaceful family environment of an honest man, nay society as well. Produced by Howrah Dakshinayan and directed by Mukhopadhyay.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts

 Sunday, February 16, 2003 				 Baby girl found on platform
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A newborn baby girl was found abandoned at Garia railway station on Friday night. The baby, weighing over 2 kg, was found wailing on the platform.																								A school teacher, later identified as Soma Chakraborty, expressed her desire to take the baby home, but local police prevented her from doing so. We cannot hand over the baby just now. There is a legal process which has to be followed if anyone wants to adopt the child, a senior police officer told her.																								However, local residents and railway employees urged the police to relent. After much deliberation, the baby was handed over to MR Bangur Hospital for treatment. The baby is fine. She is responding to medication, a hospital employee said. The police are trying to locate the babys parents.																								Meanwhile, the baby boy kept at Sishu Nivas is also doing well. He was found abandoned on Amherst Street on Friday. Several childless couples, wanting to adopt the child, have visited the hospital. We have asked them to come next week and talk to the authorities concerned, said a doctor at Sishu Nivas.																								nServant dead: A 35-year-old domestic help was found dead in a businessmans house in Bhowanipore on Saturday. The cause of the womans death can be determined only after post-mortem, a police officer said.

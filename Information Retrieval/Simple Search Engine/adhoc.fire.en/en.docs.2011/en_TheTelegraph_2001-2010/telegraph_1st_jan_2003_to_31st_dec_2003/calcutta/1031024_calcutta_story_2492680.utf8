The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, October 24, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The stretch of VIP Road near the Ultadanga bridge is a spot of traffic chaos. Private buses slow down at this point as a number of passengers stand on the road waiting to be picked up. Though there is no bus stand at this spot, it has become a practice with people. Besides, the sight of pedestrians zigzagging their way through the rush of vehicles is frightening, as this can spark an accident any moment. 				 																																									Piyal Mukherjee,				 																																									Lake Town.				 																																									Calcutta is known for its connoisseurs of classical music, but its sad to note that All India Radio (AIR) does not broadcast such songs frequently. As the young generation is not much aware of this genre, it is only pertinent that more emphasis be laid on airing classical tunes. Music conferences, which were a regular feature of the city during the winter, have lost their charm. A concerted effort needs to be made by the organisers to revive the spirit.				 																																									Rabindranath Kar,				 																																									Sankar Ghosh Lane.

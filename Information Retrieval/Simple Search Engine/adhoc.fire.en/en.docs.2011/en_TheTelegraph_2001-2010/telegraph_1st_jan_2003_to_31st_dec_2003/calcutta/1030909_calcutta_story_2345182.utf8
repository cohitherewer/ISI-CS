 Tuesday, September 09, 2003 				 Relation and its multiple facets
																								An artist expresses himself through his works and his world is inhabited by visuals  real and imaginary. Nine talented artists: Amit Kumar Dey, Arnab Mukherjee, Ashish Mondal, Chandra Nath Saha, Mallika Das, Milan Das, Polly Das, Subhabrata Bose and Sudipta Dutta, of various age groups from a cross-section of society have congregated under an umbrella organisation, Relations, and are currently showcasing their works. Each of these artists have very distinct individualistic styles and vocabulary, yet what binds them together is their keen desire for experimentation  with form, subject, media and content. Vibrant colours juxtaposed with dark sombre ones, pensive profiles next to canvas with tribal motifs, nature studies next to symbolic statements create a wide variety that gives the viewer some breathing space and desire to explore the unknown. All the paintings are appealing for their mature strokes and deft handling.																								When: Till September 12; 11 am - 7 pm																								Where: Artists Circle, 46 Circus Avenue

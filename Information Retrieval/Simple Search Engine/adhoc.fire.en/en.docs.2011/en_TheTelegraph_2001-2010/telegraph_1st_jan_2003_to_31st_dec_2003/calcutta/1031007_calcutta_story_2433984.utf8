 Tuesday, October 07, 2003 				 Basu blast greets Bose judge jibe
 BARUN GHOSH				 	 Jyoti Basu and Left Front chairman Biman Bose: Nothing personal 																								Jyoti Basu made it clear on Monday that while he was critical of Justice Amitava Lalas rein-rally verdict, the personal attack on the high court judge by Left Front chairman Biman Bose was uncalled for.																								We have every right to defy or obey a courts order. But in no way should we criticise the judge concerned I am opposed to any personal attack on a judge, the former chief minister told Metro, even as he voiced his support for the October 8 protest planned by the Left Front.																								Though the government has already moved the division bench in appeal, let us see what happens in the long run. Our approach should be a cautious one, added Basu.																								Biman Bose, a CPM politburo member, had on Saturday attacked Justice Lala during a press conference. We will not abide by the ruling and may even raise slogans urging Lala to go back, he had said. Bose then went on to call the judge unwanted in Bengal, as he did not understand the culture and tradition of 4.8 million tribal people, whose procession had held him up on his way to the court, triggering the crackdown on disruptive weekday rallies.																								Basu is learnt to have discussed the matter at length with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and CPM state secretary Anil Biswas, whom he spent time with before the Front meeting on Saturday. It was after the meeting that Bose launched the attack on Justice Lala and his ruling.																								Echoing Basu, senior RSP secretariat member and trade union leader Sunil Sengupta said the manner in which the Front chairman had criticised a high court judge was unbecoming of a senior politician.																								We are, in principle, opposed to the judges order and so we have decided to organise a mass convention on Wednesday, under the aegis of the Left Front, as part of a sustained agitation against the ruling. But we have nothing personal against the judge, stresses Sengupta.																								Forward Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said the Front, in its hour-long meeting on Saturday, had discussed the strategy to be adopted to counter Justice Lalas directive restricting weekday rallies.																								We were unanimous in opposing the directive as a policy decision, but we did not utter a single word against the judge. So, Boses personal observations about the judge have nothing to do with the Fronts future course of action, said Ghosh.

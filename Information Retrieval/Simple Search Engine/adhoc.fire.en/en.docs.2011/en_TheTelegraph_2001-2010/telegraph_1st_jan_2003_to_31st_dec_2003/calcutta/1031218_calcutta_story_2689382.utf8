 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Inside job stink in bank loot
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The bank robbers, who left the Kidderpore branch of Central Bank of India poorer by Rs 85 lakh on Tuesday morning, couldnt have asked for easier pickings  almost the entire sum had been carefully counted and kept aside.																								The precision of the 40-minute swoop has raised the stink of an inside job, with at least 10 bank employees being questioned by officials of Watgunge police station and the detective department on Wednesday. We are not ruling out inside involvement, said deputy commissioner of police (special), detective department, Damayanti Sen.																								The first to feel the heat of the probe into the biggest bank heist in Bengal in decades was police constable Prabhat Kumar Sarkar, who was guarding the bank with an empty rifle. Sarkar was suspended on Wednesday. The fact that a cleaner and a canteen boy had spent Monday night in the bank  violating RBI norms  is also being probed.																								O.P. Gupta, deputy commissioner of police, port division, said the bank had received Rs 60 lakh deposit money on Monday. The authorities were to send Rs 80 lakh to the Alipore treasury around 11 am on Tuesday.																								The money was kept ready in an almirah inside the strong-room. The goons first zeroed in on that amount, before taking the rest from another almirah, said Gupta. They seemed to have exact information. 																								The modus operandi prompted police to draw parallels with the earlier Rs 5-lakh robbery from Punjab National Banks Gariahat branch. A gang from Jharkhand had carried out the operation, with the help of local operatives. So, a team left for Jharkhand on Wednesday, said a detective department official.

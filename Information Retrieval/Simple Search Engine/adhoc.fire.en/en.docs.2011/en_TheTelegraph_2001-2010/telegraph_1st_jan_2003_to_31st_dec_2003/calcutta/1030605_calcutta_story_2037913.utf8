  All in a day's work: Policemen on  duty  Apropos Line and length ruled his life (Metro, June 3), I would like to let readers know of another casualty of treatment in government hospitals.  My uncle, Malay Dasgupta, had been suffering from Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma detected in1999 and was under treatment at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute since then. He was given chemotherapy in 1999 and a regular check-up was recommended. He kept going for these check-ups. He started suffering from fever and throat problems in April. The doctor assured him that he was fine and he was again advised a routine check-up in October 2002. But when things started deteriorating, he was taken to the hospital again on May 1, 2003. The doctors wanted certain tests done. These tests took 12 days to yield results. We were ready to get the tests done from outside to shorten the time span but the doctors insisted on getting them done from the hospital. Till May 12, every other day he was taken to the hospital with fever upto 103 degree Fahrenheit. On May 13, when his condition deteriorated, the doctors admitted him at our insistence. The authorities got us to sign a letter of serious case and washed their hands off the matter. The head of the department concerned always referred the junior doctors whenever we had a question. They tried their best but confessed that they dont have the required infrastructure for such serious patients. My uncle expired on May 21 after going through a series of tests.  I admit that death was inevitable but had his malady been detected earlier when he went for the routine check-up, we could have arranged for measures to prevent him from reaching the worse condition and perhaps he would have been with us for a few more days.  Gargi Talapatra,  Shiromoni Para, B.D Sopan.  Every now and then Calcutta High Court expresses unhappiness at the attitude of the state police (Court frowns on police delay in tracing kids, Metro, May 3). The division bench has rightly observed that people have little confidence in the police. They have become stooges of the ruling party and harass people if their palms are not greased. The need of the hour is a revamp.  Mohan Lal Sarkar,  Budge Budge.  Apropos the report Post-mortem law ahead (Metro, May 8), even if a government policy is framed to make post-mortem of persons dying of unknown diseases mandatory, for sentimental reasons, the body should be taken for tests only after getting the consent of the persons relatives.  Md. Moinuddin,  Jamadar Khan Lane.  There are lakhs of old people who need help in emergency (Help a call away in medical distress, Metro, May 12). I shall be obliged if you give the phone number of Aastha.  T. C. Shah,  Sarat Chatterjee Road, Lake  Town. Metro replies: The contact  number of Aastha is 2454-3454.  It is tough to understand why the Madhyamik Board has turned down an appeal by some English-medium schools to have the answer-scripts of their students evaluated only by teachers of similar institutions (Metro, May 7). If the answer-scripts of Hindi medium students are sent to teachers of Hindi-medium schools, what is the objection in this case?  Deba Prasad Bhattacharyya,  Noapara.  Kanchan Gaba deserves kudos for her determination (Of capability, potential and challenges, Metro, May 8).  Kunal Ray,  Howrah.  This is to express our anguish over the report A joke in the name of Raja Rammohun Roy (Metro, May 23). The Simla House lay in ruins for more than three decades before it came into the possession of Rammohan College. We are thankful to the public works department which painstakingly restored the dilapidated building. Since then the Memorial Museum Committee have been battling all odds, primarily financial, to give shape to the memorial. The museum is yet in the making. The necessary research work is in progress. Most original objects and articles associated with the Rajas life were lost long before the building was acquired by our college. No doubt there is still room for improvement, but that cannot be reason enough for such damning and ignoble indictment.  Suchisree Das,  Secretary, Raja Rammohun Roy Memorial Museum Committee.  Metro replies: We stand by the opinion that  the so-called Raja Rammohun Roy Memorial Museum is a blot  on the memory of that giant of the Bengal Renaissance, and  that the public works department squandered away public  money by making a mockery of restoring the building associated  with him.

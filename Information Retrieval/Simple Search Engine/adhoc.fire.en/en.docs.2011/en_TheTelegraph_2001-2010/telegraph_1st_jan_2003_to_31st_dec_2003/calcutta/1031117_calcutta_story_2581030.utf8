The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, November 17, 2003 				 Marketplace swamped by garbage
								Kartik Banerjee: The stretch of road in front of the Kasba CIT market needs to be cleaned on a regular basis. The market produces a lot of litter and the lorry comes at odd hours to remove the garbage. Most of the time, it arrives around 8.30 in the morning, when shopping is at its peak.																																																													I have heard about this. I have spoken to the driver, too, and it has been decided that the garbage will be cleared late in the afternoon or at night. We also plan to put up another vat, so that the waste does not overflow on the road.

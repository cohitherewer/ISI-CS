																																																																																		The district police of South 24-Parganas have made elaborate arrangements for making the Pujas trouble-free. Superintendent of police (SP) D.K. Ganguly said a team of 5,000 personnel would be deployed at any given time on these four days. Apart from this, special police teams will be stationed at the Kasba, Jadavpur, Thakurpukur and Metiabruz police station areas. CESC and telecom officials will be available at the police control room in Alipore to attend to emergency calls. A tower will be set up with wireless facility on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass near Ruby General Hospital for monitoring the situation. SP Ganguly said police have arrested 9,557 persons as part of a pre-Puja crackdown on miscreants. Fifteen more had been arrested for forcibly collecting subscriptions.																																																		Two women, Majeda and Mehrunnisa, were arrested on Wednesday evening from Camac Street, in the Shakespeare Sarani police station area, on charges of peddling drugs.

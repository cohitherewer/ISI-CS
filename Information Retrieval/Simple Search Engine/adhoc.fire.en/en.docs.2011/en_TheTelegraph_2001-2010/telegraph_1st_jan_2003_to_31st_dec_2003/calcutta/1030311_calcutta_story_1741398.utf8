The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Have a ball between exams
 Sachin unplugged: Exam or no exam, who would want to miss the maestro in full flow?  As India gets hotter on the field, the student plight gets that much harder to bear. There is nothing super about stressing about exams during the Sixes. As Sachin bats like a dream, a fans worst nightmare is coming true. It may be too late now for the batch of 2003, but for future examinees, here is Time to Talks final instalment in response to the poser Should exams be rescheduled if they clash with sporting events?lIt is definitely a good idea to reschedule internal exams if they clash with sporting events. But what will happen to candidates for the Boards? The finals cannot be rescheduled as that would result in delaying the admission procedure and disrupting the entire academic routine of the year.Aparajita Dasgupta,IIIrd year, Asutosh CollegelSchools and colleges should not normally reschedule exams if they clash with a sporting event. But if the event is to decide the champion of champions, the answer is YES. The entire nation wants to sit in front of the TV set and watch the Indian team play, rather than be under the pressure of exams.Gunjeet WadhwalYou cant make everyone happy at the same time. Exams are held at various times in different institutes, and it would be impossible to reschedule all of them.Md. Tarique Nisar,Ist year, St Xaviers CollegelStudies should get the topmost priority in a students life. It is much more important than any sporting event. It would be ridiculous to change the routine of the education system and delay examinations for the mere temporary pleasure of sports.Suchi Arya,Class XII, Modern High SchoollStudents who are to fare well will do so despite the World Cup. Good students know the importance of exams. The matches could also be a pleasant break after a long period of study. The games will just be an excuse for irregular students to avoid studying. Publication of results on time will also pose a severe problem for examiners and students.Kaushik Daga,Class X, Shri Daulatram Nopany VidyalayalWe, students, cant concentrate on our studies because of the on-going World Cup. The HS exams are around the corner, but we have all decided to take out time to watch the matches, which come only once in four years. If we dont appear for our exams, our parents will be very disappointed.Tulip Kumar Saha,Class XII, Barasat Peary Charan Sarkar Govt High SchoollThere is always something or the other coming up, and schools cant change their calendars to accommodate everything a student is interested in. In fact, there should always be some sport to watch alongside our studies so we can take breaks in between our study sessions.Rashi Daga,Class IX, Modern High SchoollI think schools and colleges must reschedule the exams if they clash with the World Cup as most students would not like to miss the action. They will have to wait four years for this excitement.Sananda SenIIIrd year, Asutosh CollegelBoth studies and the World Cup are a Big Thing in our lives. No one wants to miss either. We are well aware of the cut-throat competition we will face when we start looking for jobs. So we have no choice but to miss the World Cup for our exams. But while postponing exams is not an option, the authorities could arrange the papers so we can enjoy the major matches.Sharmistha Dan,Class XI, Shri ShikshayatanlSchools could consider rescheduling exams for the really big sporting events that come after a long time, like the World Cup. It would be nice for those appearing for their board exams if the concerned authority would draw up considerate schedules.Aditi Daga,Mahadevi Birla GirlslIf the authorities had taken the initiative to reschedule the exams due to the World Cup, it would have been great. As the fixtures had been announced a long time ago, the clash could have been avoided. Now, as dates have been fixed, it is not practical to juggle them.Vineeta Nair,Class XII, Modern High School

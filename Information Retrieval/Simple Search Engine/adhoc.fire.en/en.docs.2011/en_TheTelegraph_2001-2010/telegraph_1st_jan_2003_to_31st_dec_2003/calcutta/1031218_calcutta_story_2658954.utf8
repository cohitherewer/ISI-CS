The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Thursday, December 18, 2003 				 Go state-of-the-art for that nagging ache
 A STAFF REPORTER																								You are sitting at your desk, rapt in the laptop, when an important sheet of paper suddenly slides off your desk. You stoop to retrieve it, and on your way up, feel a sharp stab of pain shoot up your spine. The routine hot fomentation and the balm rub do nothing to make it better and you writhe in agony for days at work and at home.																								Nagging aches and pains in various parts of the body are coming as excess baggage in todays breathless life, forcing more and more people to pop painkillers at random. Common injuries that may heal on the surface, leave nagging pains behind. A sedentary lifestyle and bad postures also trigger debilitating pain in uncomfortable areas, say doctors.																								Now, Calcutta has a dedicated pain clinic to diagnose, treat and manage all kinds of aches and pains, irrespective of their domain of medical speciality. National Neurosciences Centre (NNC), the regions only dedicated neurosciences hospital that also supports clinical research, launched its specialised pain clinic on December 1.																								There are other centres, like the Bangur Institute of Neurology, with isolated pain-management wings. But, with state-of-the-art neurosurgery and neuroradiology back-up and access to other specialities, like orthopaedics and physical medicine, ours is the first integrated pain clinic with a multi-disciplinary approach, says Sucharita Chakrabarti, head of the anaesthesiology department at NNC, in charge of the clinic.																								Changing lifestyles and demanding careers have left little time and space for us to stop and listen to our body. Fuelled by a desire to excel, we push ourselves to the limit and often ignore early warning signals, observes Rahul De, full-time consultant at the centre. 																								The pain clinic, primarily an OPD facility, diagnoses and treats patients suffering from pains in various parts of their bodies from 10:30 am to 1 pm every day. Most of the early referrals have come from the neurosurgery department, where surgery is not indicated.																								While low-back pain would constitute 50 to 60 per cent of our patients, even terminally-ill cancer patients suffering from intense pain due to malignant deposits in the vertebra can be treated at this pain clinic. Anyone with any kind of pain can walk in. We try to analyse the cause and find out who can help if we cant, explains Chakrabarti.																								De stresses pains are early warning signs that something is not quite right, and cautions that no pain, especially nagging ones, should be ignored. Pains occur due to various reasons, but the underlying cause can be traced back to nerves. We zero in on the problem nerve and treat it. Even pains arising from medical domains like orthopaedics and cardiology can be treated at our clinic, he adds.																								While there are surgical and non-surgical treatments for back pain, neck pain and spinal injuries, occupational pains like carpal tunnel syndromes are also treated at the clinic through a simple surgery to free the compressed nerve, says Chakrabarti. The centres fully-equipped intensive trauma unit (ITU) is the only one in the city dedicated to neurological patients. quot;We dont house other patients at either our ITU or high-dependence unit (HDU), quot; De explains.

																																																											The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education has deferred publication of the results of Madhyamik 2003 to mid-June. The results of Madhyamik exams were announced on May 23 in 2002. Board secretary Amar Chandra Patra said on Tuesday that the evaluation of scripts was almost complete. Explaining that the slow-and-steady move was aimed at minimising errors after the marksheet scandal in 2002, Board sources put part of the blame for the delay on the panchayat polls. The evaluation of the answer-scripts was delayed earlier in May as many teachers engaged in the process had to carry out election duties. The industrial strike on May 21, too, added to the delay.																																																											A jilted lover, Ranjit Das, committed suicide by setting himself on fire after dousing himself with kerosene in his bedroom at Blackburn Square Lane, in the Burtolla police station area, on Tuesday morning. Police said Das was in love with a girl and had proposed to her recently but she had turned him down. Das relatives told police that he had been depressed over the past two days. He left a suicide note stating that he did not blame anybody for his death. His body was taken to RG Kar Hospital. 																																																											Calcutta University on Tuesday decided to stop granting permission to its affiliated colleges to open pass courses in conventional subjects like history, political science and philosophy. The decision was taken at a meeting of the universitys syndicate. The number of examinees in the BA Part I examination has increased by 10,000 this year compared to 2002. We may find it difficult to hold the BA examinations if the number of students increases at this rate, said pro vice-chancellor, academic, Suranjan Das. 																																																											Five youths robbed a house in Puddapukur on Tuesday. Police said five men went to the residence of Raj Kumar Jalan posing as agents from a courier service company. Jalan was then out on work.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 20, 2003 				 Civic sense, citizen sensibilities
 - POST WASTE: LITTER BIN-CUM-LETTER BOX  Does the blame for our squalid  streets lie with us or our city fathers? Metro  asks some Calcuttans, and the conservancy boss. A trash bin installed on Beadon Street two weeks ago  doubles as a letter box. On the second day after it  was set up, the civic employees who tipped the bin to  clean it out, found 70 letters among the garbage, posted  by people who mistook the bin for a pillar box. The  letters were handed over to the Posts and Telegraph  department. Pictures by Amit Datta  Name: Pradyut Chakravarty Occupation: Senior geologist,  Geological Survey of India Citizenspeak: We all would  like this city to be neat and clean, but where is  the system for that? It is the job of the Corporation  to monitor cleanliness on the streets. If they cant  do it, they should not collect civic taxes from you  and me. The fact that Calcutta appears to still be  in the Dark Ages is the fault of the civic authorities.  How can they slap a fine for urinating on the streets  if they dont provide adequate public toilets? Rajib Deb (civic conservancy  chief) replies: Civic sense cannot be inculcated  overnight and without punitive action, people will  not mend their ways. Name: Devarshy Ganguly Occupation: MBA student Citizenspeak: A lot can  be done if there is a will to do it. But the civic  authorities only hit the streets when they need to  raise money. Take the death toll due to malaria   where in the civilised world would you find people  dying of malaria? But here, no one seems to be bothered.  The malaria drive is a farce. Also, post-SARS, the  civic authorities in all the affected cities have  changed their outlook to cleanliness. Calcutta remains  its squalid self. Rajib Deb replies: We have  curbed malarial deaths to a large extent. But beyond  a point, it is up to the people to keep their homes  and surroundings clean. Name: Doel Mukherjee Occupation: Lecturer, Rani  Birla Girls College Citizenspeak: There are  only two actions associated with the Corporation   collection of taxes and gearing up for elections.  The Corporation must campaign vigorously to spread  civic sense. In the present system  or the lack of  it  those following the rules are looked upon as  fools. Rajib Deb replies: The  Corporation is a political body, but to say that it  works just for votes on poll-eve is incorrect. Name: Kousik Batabyal Occupation: Computer science  student Citizenspeak: A cleanliness  drive cannot be effective in a city with such a huge  population where the civic authorities are too busy  politicking. Where are the trash bins and the public  toilets here? If the civic authorities fine offenders,  it would be a form of extortion. Rajib Deb replies: We are  in the process of pushing more trash cans into the  city and creating more pay-and-use toilets.

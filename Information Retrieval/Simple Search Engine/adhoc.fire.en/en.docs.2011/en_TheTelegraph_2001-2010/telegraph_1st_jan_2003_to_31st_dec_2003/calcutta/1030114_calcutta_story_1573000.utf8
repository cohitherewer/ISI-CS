				 	VISHAL AGARWAL																									But Vishu is known more as a man of action. On and off the pitch, he has outpaced the competition with ease.																									Did the student of Michigan State University, during his stint as opening bowler (not to forget his role as a lower order batsman) for the Cricket Association of Bengal Under-19 tourneys. In fact, Art of Living classes may have helped him on field, bolstering his powers of concentration. Played for his former school  Don Bosco  and donned the whites for inter-school tournaments at Don Bosco Liluah and St. Xaviers. Though Vishal has chosen his path a pacer, Sachin is still the man for him.																									Were spent helping out at the Missionaries of Charity, the Little Sisters of the Poor and a leprosy hospital during his stint in the Interact. The Director of International Understanding for the Interact Club also helped organise Amigo, the schools annual fest. Helped with a benefit for the Kargil soldiers and a disease awareness project on thalassaemia, AIDS and cancer. Now he is treasurer of the Hindu Club in college and a social committee member in the finance association. Has been travelling across the US for social projects financed by the University as well, creating awareness about Indian culture during the road shows.																									Is what he played here, too, taking the stage for events at fests. Strutted his stuff as part of the fashion show team, bagging the first prize at a number of them. Nature club fests and science meets also saw our man bring home a few golds.																									Or, at least not one who doesnt know his stuff. His grade point average of 3.9 out of 4 won him a special mention on his Universitys Deans list last year.

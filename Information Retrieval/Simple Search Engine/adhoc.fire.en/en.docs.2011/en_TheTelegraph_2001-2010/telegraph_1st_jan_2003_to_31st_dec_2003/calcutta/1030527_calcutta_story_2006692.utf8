 																											- Team vets teaching infrastructure for under-graduate courses A STAFF REPORTER																								A team from the Medical Council of India visited SSKM Hospital on Monday to check the infrastructure of the hospital for introduction of under-graduate medical courses at the hospital. 																								The three-member team, comprising Atul Vora from Guwahati, along with Meenakshi Pathak and Asha Gandhi from New Delhi, visited the different departments of SSKM Hospital through the day.																								They have expressed satisfaction with the existing infrastructure of the hospital, Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay, SSKM surgeon superintendent, said on Monday. During the two-day visit, the team will check the infrastructure, including staff strength, SSKM officials said. 																								The team did not visit the University College of Medicine (UCM) and only inspected the various departments of the hospital. Some members of the staff at the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Research and Education were waiting for the team with placards to protest the state governments decision to induct post-graduate trainees as class demonstrators. The team will make a detailed investigation of UCM on Tuesday morning, before leaving.																								The state governments acquisition of the UCM has incensed institute teachers. Many of them have alleged that their future has become uncertain after the government move.																								I have not received my salary since March. Some teachers have received partial salary for 20 days only, said Hirendranath Dutta, a UCM teacher. 																								Dutta has filed a case in Calcutta High Court. The court, in a recent decision, had asked Calcutta University to pay Dutta his arrears and has given the university authorities a months time to let it know whether or not they will retain Dutta.

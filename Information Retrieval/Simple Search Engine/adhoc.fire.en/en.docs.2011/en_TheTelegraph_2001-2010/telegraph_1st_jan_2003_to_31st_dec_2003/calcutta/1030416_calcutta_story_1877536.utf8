				 																																										lThe vice-principal of a city high school was conned by two youths and a girl and robbed of valuables worth several thousand rupees in Howrah late on Monday, police said. Manjula Chaturvedi was on her way back from a concert at the Science City auditorium when the trio offered to give her a lift in their Maruti. Thinking that it would be difficult to catch a taxi at the odd hour, Chaturvedi got into the car. The gang then crossed Vidyasagar Setu, halted in a deserted spot at Santragachhi, in Howrah, and asked her to hand over all her valuables. When she protested, the girl held a dagger to her throat, the vice-principal told the police. The trio then forced her to get off the car. Later, Chaturvedi lodged a complaint with the police.				 																																										An employee of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), posted in Guwahati, was detained for interrogation at the citys airport police station shortly after he stepped off a Jet Airways flight from Guwahati on Tuesday evening. The employee had reportedly wanted to meet the pilot soon after take-off. When refused, the man, around 38, insisted that he was an employee of the AAI and had the right to enter the cockpit, said Ajay Nand, additional superintendent of police (Salt Lake). A little later, he tried to force his way into the cockpit but the pilot had locked himself in. Later, the pilot lodged a complaint. During interrogation, the man could not provide any answers, a CISF official said. It seems he is mentally unstable, Nand added.				 																																										A Taltala police team left for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on Monday to search for Kallu and his accomplice, charged with the murder of two traders in central Calcutta. The city police team will raid a few areas in both the states, said deputy commissioner of police, central, Zulfiquar Hasan.				 																																										Papul Bahadur, alias Surada Bahadur Sonal, was arrested at Metiabruz on Monday night. The police have recovered 16 g of heroin from him. Bahadur was wanted in several cases of dacoity and murder.				 																																										A lubricant shop was gutted in a fire in Hooghly on Tuesday. Two fire engines brought the blaze under control after fighting it for about an hour. Fire brigade sources said the blaze might have been caused by an oil lamp. The shop-owner fled immediately after the fire broke out.				 																																										Power supply was disrupted in large areas of Salt Lake on Tuesday evening for about three hours after State Electricity Board (SEB) engineers switched off supply to repair the high-tension 132-KV Salt Lake-Ashoknagar distribution line. SEB sources said attempts were made to supply power to Salt Lake from the 33-KV sub-station at Narayanpur, but it failed to meet the demand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 28, 2003 Rajesh Kumar Singh								Additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas																																							House-owners let out their houses to whoever offers them the highest rent, without bothering to check their antecedents. This has to stop. Often tenants commit crime and disappear without a trace. House-owners are of no help. In Mumbai, there is a law that makes it mandatory for landlords to supply information to the police about prospective tenants. The police then verify the information. Premises can be let out only after getting a clearance certificate from the police. Such a system has to be introduced here as well.

 Aloka Kanungo Kaberi Sen																								Music, like every other thing, needs to be nurtured for it to grow and spread the message of bliss. And this tending can be done by an individual, or better still an organisation of the stature of Jhankar Music Circle founded as far back as 1948 by stalwarts like Pandit Jnan Prakash Ghosh and Pandit Radhika Mohan Maitra. Ever since, along with its innumerable concerts with prestigious musicians as well as its support for the aspiring ones, the organisation still strives for its motto of excellence. The first evening of the two-day festival features Aloka Kanungo and her disciple Kaberi Sen in Odissi recitals. One of the countrys foremost Odissi dancers, Kanungo is also known to have produced many-a-deserving student, Kaberi Sen being one of them. The second evening, Basanta Utsab, presents seasonal songs by the Jhankar Music Circle Choir, who will perform dhrupad, dhamar, khayal, thumri and folk, ably compered by Aparna Chakravarti. 																								When: April 12 and 13; 6 pm																								Where: Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture

 Monday, April 07, 2003 				 Move for health
																								As a focussed insistence on health awareness, Prayasam holds regular health fairs, primarily with the children of Dakshindari under South Dum Dum Municipality. The most pressing concern of any developing country is its health services. The available health services in India fall grossly short of requirement and thus prevention is better than cure becomes all the more important. Prayasam has all along been working towards building an awareness of health and hygiene among the population of Rishi Aurobindo Colony, Ultadanga. Every year in April, the annual evaluation of Prayasams Child Area Health Minders takes place. For this, they prepare a year round activity profile of their work as well as plans and programmes for the coming year. Last year they had succesfully mobilised people to immunise their children by taking polio vaccine. To mark the World Health Day, Prayasam has organised a two-day health fair that began yesterday at Rishi Aurobindo Colony, Ultadanga. Apart from a variety of programmes on health, the fair includes a picto-profile exhibition of the activities of Prayasams Child Area Health Minders. The event concludes today with a Health for All Walk.																								When: Today; 8 am onwards																								Where: Rishi Aurobindo Colony, Golaghata

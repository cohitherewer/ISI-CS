 A STAFF REPORTER																								A Higher Secondary (HS) examinee crumbled under the pressure to perform and hanged himself from the ceiling of his bedroom in Atapara, in the Baranagar police station area, on Sunday. In his suicide note, 18-year-old Arindam wrote that the fear of not meeting expectations over his HS marks had forced him to end his life. Arindams father, Pulak Nandi, said his sons suicide was a shock, but added that he had appeared distracted after the physics examination on Saturday.																								Arindam, studying in a local school, had set himself a target of 80 per cent in one of the papers. But after the exams, he feared he would fall short of that and decided to kill himself, a local police officer said. Basudeb Bag, superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, however, said nothing conclusive could be said till further investigations.

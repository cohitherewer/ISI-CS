 Thursday, November 06, 2003 				 Salt Lake bypass to airport
 SANJAY MANDAL																								The route is different; the destination is the same. The alignment is different; the aim is the same. The much-awaited link road connecting Salt Lake with the airport is poised to take off, with the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government deciding to discard the old proposed route and chalk out a new pathway.																								The road  starting next to the CSTC bus stand near the entry point of Sector V, cutting through Rajarhat New Town and hitting VIP Road at Kaikhali, two km from the airport  has been approved by the government.																								It has been decided that the cost of constructing the road will be equally shared by CMDA and Hidco. Tenders for the project will be floated soon, said Alapan Bandyopadhyay, chief executive officer of CMDA. The cost of construction has been pegged at around Rs 7 crore. Work on the Salt Lake bypass would start soon on portions where land is readily available. 																								The revised proposal focuses on a six-lane road, about 955 m in length, of which 530 m will involve widening of a 15-m-wide existing road. The remaining 425 m will be new. The earlier plan, rejected for the cost factor (Rs 36 crore), was for a four-lane elevated road of about one km, including the approaches. 																								In addition, a 200 m at-grade 																								road would have to be built to																								wards the Keshtopur bridge. quot;Be																								sides the high cost, the plan was 																								very complicated with several 																								humps that needed to be con																								structed, quot; said a state urban de																								velopment department official.																								The new scheme requires 127 																								cottahs of land from allottees 																								like Border Security Force, West 																								Bengal State Electricity Board, 																								Central Reserve Police Force and 																								Webel. For the remaining 																								stretch, requiring 197 cottahs, 																								the land is more or less available 																								except for one building and some 																								other small structures.																								A survey is being conducted 																								to the help clear the path for the 																								link road. quot;Issues like compensa																								tion and alternative spots are 																								being discussed with organisa																								tions situated on the route, quot; said 																								a urban development official. A 																								committee with officials from 																								CMDA, Hidco and the urban de																								velopment department has been 																								formed to speed up the process.																								Plans are also afoot to con																								struct a road connecting the Salt 																								Lake bypass with the Rashebe																								hari Avenue connector of the 																								EM Bypass. quot;This is a part of a 																								long-term scheme to set up a 																								Greater Calcutta Ring Road, quot; 																								said Bandyopadhyay.																								CMDA would be given the re																								sponsibility to construct the 																								roads.

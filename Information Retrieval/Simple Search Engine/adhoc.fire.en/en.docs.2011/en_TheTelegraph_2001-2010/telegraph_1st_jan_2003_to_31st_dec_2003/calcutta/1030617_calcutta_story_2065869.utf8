The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, June 17, 2003 				 Seven cheers for seven stars
 The nominees are ... (from top) Medha  Patkar, Prannoy Roy, Aamir Khan, N.R. Narayana Murthy,  Sourav Ganguly, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Amartya  Sen Who are the people who inspire  young Calcutta? We have all heard what MTV has had to say  about it, with the nominations for the Icon of the Year  in and open for voting. And though the music channels survey  included people from Calcutta, it also took into account  the views of young guys and gals from seven other cities.  Taking a step away from the pop picks, here are Young  Metros nominations for the Star of the Year: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee				 				 																															Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee may have been their choice from the political boxing ring, but Buddhadeb bhadralok Bhattacharjee is our choice of winner. Turning the rules of red on their head, he has made all the right moves to save the state from being written off as dead. He is looking within and without to bring in the investment and get things going. And we can feel the change. He has always shown a commitment to the arts  particularly films  and for that he has our two thumbs up! Amartya Sen				 				 																															The son of Bengals soil wins over the MTV pick from science and academics, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Its more than a toss up between the nukes and the Nobel. Not only in the academic arena  where Sens contribution is undoubtedly invaluable  but also as an ambassador for our nation in the finest universities across the globe, he is unparalleled. For being the best amongst the rest, we salute him! Sourav Ganguly				 				 																															No offence  we all LOVE Sachin. But the best batsman in the world will have to take a backseat in our idol ratings, because the captains push for team play is something worth aspiring for. There is no knocking the Master Blasters personal greatness, but something must be said  specially for a generation of wannabe managers  for galvanising a whole team to up the aggro in attitude and aptitude. Medha Patkar				 				 																															When it comes to environmental activism, the firebrand Patkars crusades are the first that come to mind. True, Maneka Gandhi has made her mark in her pet area  animal rights. But the passion Patkar brought to the Narmada Bachao Andolan and her recent focus on the Sunderbans tourism projects make her the countrys most active activist.				 				 																															Aamir Khan				 				 																															Need we explain why Aamir has our vote for the man with the mojo? Shah Rukh may have raked it in with Devdas, and may be going places Chalte Chalte, but Aamir, with or without Lagaan to his credit, is the thinking mans hero and the wise womans hearththrob. With his forays into production and his astute negotiations with Coke, he is our dil chahta hai man. Prannoy Roy				 				 																															Smriti Malhotra as an icon? No how! As one of the stars of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, perpetuating every negative gender stereotype in the book, this actress gives way to Prannoy Roy, who broke loose from the STAR stable with NDTV 24x7. After the initial teething trouble, the news channel is developing an identity, an identity unmistakably Roy, suave and sincere. N.R.Narayana Murthy				 				 																															If we are talking about industry, we should also start talking more about corporate social responsibility. Anil Ambani  whose company is now under the scanner for allegedly underhand dealings  definitely loses valuable brownie points to the Infosys chairman who, besides creating a cool environment for his employees, made a mark with the swift action against an alleged sexual harasser in the companys top echelons.

	 Next steps				 				 																															With most of the results out (just the HS is pending), the top question on everyones mind is What next?. To provide an insight  at least for some  the Management, Engineering and Medical Education Fair was held from June 14 to 16. The fair, organised by Afairs, held at the Ice Skating Rink, featured stalls from around 100 institutions, from abroad as well as around the country. They were offering degrees and diplomas in the field of engineering, management, nursing, pharmacy, medicine, paramedicine, biotechnology, dentistry, aeronautics and emerging careers in the arts, humanities and commerce.				 				 																															Spot counselling and guidance were on offer, according to students interests and academic qualifications by institutions such as Global Institute of Management and Technology, National Institute of Science and Technology, IMS Ghaziabad, AICMS Business School, Yeshwant Rao Chavan College of Engineering (Nagpur), South Asia International Institute (Hyderabad), University of Wales and Canterbury Christ College. But the main attraction was the student loan offered by the United Bank of India for all the available courses.				 				 																															The trends in education are fast-changing and the awareness level amongst students is noteworthy, remarked Sanjeev Bolia, CEO, Afairs.

	 All for one				 				 																															Interacts Each One Teach One education project saw 102 students of privilege touch the lives of 150 of their economically-challenged friends. Students of premiere schools, including Pratt Memorial, St Thomas for Girls, Don Bosco Park Circus, Welland Gouldsmith, St James and St Josephs College, spent time at three non-formal schools run by Calcutta Police and NGOs, under the Nabadisha-project umbrella.				 				 																															After mornings spent helping the kids with their lessons, the student initiative ended with a bang on June 15, with the Nabadisha kids putting up a show. The youngest girls and boys from the Bowbazar branch performed a fruit recitation, with a sizzling dance to Mohabbat hai mirchi and an Akbar-Birbal play being followed by an impressive juggling routine. The kids from the Lake centre chose to present a selection of their favourite nursery rhymes, part of a Rabindranath play and a dance choreographed to a medley of popular Hindi songs. The gang from Beniapukur presented a dance to a song from Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and a play entitled Kaun Banega Nyaypati.				 				 																															Our thanks go out to all those who supported the project, and all the Interactors who conceived it.				 				 																															 Akshay Jain,				 				 																															Class X, St Josephs College		 Members of Zenith put up dance on skates  choreographed by Madhuchhanda Sanyal at the Clown Town  ice-skating rink on Saturday. The participants, aged  between eight and 20, will stage another show on June  28. Picture by Pabitra DasTee star				 				 																															Calcutta and the east were strokes ahead of the pack at two Sub-Junior India Golf Union tournaments held in Bangalore recently. 				 				 																															Ten-year-old Rommel Majumdar emerged the victor in the D category at the Eagleton Golf Club competition, held between May 27 and 30. Moving on to the third leg of the junior and sub junior tour at the Bangalore Golf Club, where the Southern India open was held from June 3 to 6, the youngster stole the show with a huge 21-stroke victory in the under-11 age group.				 				 																															What makes Rommels wins even more commendable is that he has a handicap of seven, when most of those in the level above him have double-figure handicaps. Coached by his army colonel father at Fort William, Rommel was all grins about his victory, particularly since an international tournament in Indonesia earlier this year, in which he was supposed to tee off, had to be cancelled because of the SARS threat. 				 				 																															Although turning 12 this month will mean having to compete with the older lot, he is confident of his prowess with a golf club thats just about as tall as him. Having to give up buying the latest Harry Potter for better sporting equipment can be tough at times, but Rommel has his priorities in order. For the moment, however, hes enjoying his stint in the spotlight.

 Thursday, January 23, 2003 				 Student crushed by wheels
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Barely 48 hours after the Road Safety Week ran its blood-splattered course, a 13-year-old boy was killed after a private bus knocked down the cycle on which he was riding pillion to his father, on the way to catch the school bus he had missed. The accident occurred near Behala Chowrasta, on Diamond Harbour Road, early on Wednesday.																								Susmit Mondal, a student of Class VII in Birla High School, went to school every morning by a school bus that he boarded from Diamond Harbour Road. But on Monday, Susmit missed the bus at that point. Next stop was Behala Chowrasta, a little distance away. So, Sisir Kumar Mondal took his son on his cycle and rushed towards Chowrasta.																								According to police, at about 7 am, a private bus on route SD-16 hit the cycle from behind, knocking both father and son down. As Susmit was sitting on the carrier behind his father, he bore the brunt. He was rushed to a private hospital, where he died within the hour.																								Doctors said the boy succumbed to internal haemorrhage suffered due to injuries to his head. Sisir Mondal suffered minor injuries. The resident of Bhuban Mohan Roy Road, under Thakurpukur police stations jurisdiction, later lodged a complaint with Behala police station. The road was almost empty and I was riding the cycle close to the pavement. Suddenly, the bus hit my cycle and my son and I were flung on the road. The bus was moving at a very high speed, as if chasing another bus, recalled Mondal.																								Police had failed to trace the bus or the driver, till late on Wednesday. Subhas Sen, inspector in charge of Behala police station, said they were trying to track down the driver of the rogue bus, but their task was cut out as no one had taken down the number of the killer vehicle. But as the route number had been ascertained, the driver would be rounded up within a day or two, assured the police.																								We have started an inquiry, but preliminary investigations reveal that the father of the boy was cycling at high speed, trying to catch up with the school bus. He tried to take a right turn without noticing the speeding bus headed in the same direction. The cycle must have veered into the path of the bus, which rammed into it, hurling both father and son to the ground, Sen added.																								Wednesdays mishap occurred less than 24 hours after Tuesdays tragedy, on Diamond Harbour Road, when Subhadra Purkait, 50, was killed on the spot and her son, Madhai, 28, was injured after a bus hit the motorcycle they were riding on. 																								If the accident, at Hariharpur, in Bishnupur, had claimed a mother (with son Madhai being released from hospital after treatment), Wednesday saw the death of a son in front of his fathers eyes.

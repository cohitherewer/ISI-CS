The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, January 22, 2003  Calcutta Column
				 																																									The Shyambazar five-point crossing has become an extremely accident-prone zone. With the constant flow of vehicles from all directions, pedestrians are often confused about how to cross the road. Since there are seldom any police personnel posted at the intersection, people rush across the street, amidst the flurry of traffic, which may drag them into a mishap any day. The situation is compounded by hawkers who squat on the edge of the pavements. Those who wait to catch a bus have to jostle for space. The police must take steps to ensure smooth traffic.				 																																									Debaprasad Mukherjee,				 																																									Nayapatty Road.				 																																									Illegal constructions are sprouting on thika land near Kailash Bose Street and Amherst Street. But the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and other law-enforcing bodies have turned a blind eye to this malpractice. We, the locals, apprehend that the promoters might have struck a deal with the authorities concerned. We dont have any say and, hence, are the worst sufferers.				 																																									Name and address withheld.

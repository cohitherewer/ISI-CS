The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Saturday, June 21, 2003 				 City Lights
				 Four fitness levels, Aussie style Gym Jam: Innovative options from Down Under are on offer  on the Bypass this winter  A hi-tech gymnasium with Australian  fitness experts on Level One; a massage centre and beauty  parlour on Level Two; a diet restaurant that lets you calculate  the calorie intake of your meal on Floor Three; a swimming  pool and spa on the rooftop. And maybe a bar, too.				 																																																											That is what Deb Pahari, a Bengali-Aussie is offering Calcuttans this winter. With work already underway on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, near Ruby General Hospital, the finance man from Sydney promises completion of the three-storied fitness destination by December.				 																																																											There are a lot of upmarket gyms in this city, which are doing very well. So, I am confident that there is a market for this, says the Australian state-level boxing champ and body-builder.				 																																																											But there is a vacuum here for an entire complex providing all these services under one roof. Im just going to be filling that void.				 																																																											The Rs 2.5-crore project, entitled Supercity International Fitness Centre (Supercity Finance is the name of his company Down Under), Pahari hopes, will be the first of many. This will be the only one we own. I want to franchise three more in Calcutta, and, if all goes well, then Ill take the concept around the country, he adds, munching on a fruitful breakfast while on a trip to town to check on the projects progress.				 																																																											Aggressive marketing is all part of the plan, with television and billboard advertising in an organised manner, which is lacking in this industry here.				 																																																											At the Bypass centre itself, there will be instructors, fitness experts and dieticians, and it will be open to everyone. You can ask for a week-long diet or exercise regimen, or join up long-term. Or just walk into the first diet restaurant in the city and eat healthy. The items on the menu will have the number of calories it contains right next to it, and there will be mostly nourishing stuff. The staff will all be trained, for which Im going to get Australian experts to show them the ropes for the first month, the muscle man explains.				 																																																											So, is Calcutta up for the fitness challenge? Calcutta is severely undersold. Everything always starts off in either Mumbai or Delhi. Thats not fair. I want to give the people here the opportunity to try something for the first time. Besides, I was born here, lived here till the age of nine and I have family here. So, I have strong ties and I wanted to do something for this city. Its too expensive to do it in Australia and the market is already saturated there. So, I thought why not India. 				 																																									 At a time when radio is on a comeback trail on the airwaves, it is time for stations to go full throttle with programmes and promos. 				 																																																											All India Radio will go on air from June 27 with a new series of radio adaptations in Bengali of major literary creations of eminent writers in Indian languages. The chosen writers are Munshi Premchand, Lakshminath Bejbaruah, Bhagabaticharan Panigrahi, Pannalal Patel, Vaikam Muhammad Bashir, Gudipati Venkatachalam, U.R. Ananthamurthy, Rajinder Singh Bedi and Amrita Pritam, along with Bengali writers Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay, Rabindranath Tagore, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay and Bibhuti Bhushan Bandopadhyay. Lending voice to the project will be leading lights from the stage like Kumar Roy, Satya Bandopadhyay and Rudraparasad Sengupta. Tune in every Friday to Calcutta A at 8 pm and on Saturdays to FM Rainbow at 2 pm.				 																																																											The radio these days has more than listening pleasure to offer. And whats better than cash incentives to keep the listener tuned in? Power FM, one of the newest channels on the waves, celebrated its first month in town with an on-air contest. Beat the Bomb began ticking between songs in search of the lucky eighth caller who had to choose his moment and shout to stop the count of random cash figures being named on the radio. The figure where he cried stop was his. We did not run the contest at regular intervals of the day so that there was an element of unpredictability in it. As soon as the contest was announced, all our five lines would start blinking simultaneously But it was great fun, said station manager Partha Majumdar. 				 																																																											The prize distribution was held on June 17 at a ceremony spiced up with cultural performances, where 121 winners shared the booty of Rs 3.75 lakh. 				 																																																											Power FM is tuning up for more contests, promises the all-hits-all-day channel. Actress June Maliah enjoys a walk in the rain with members  of Bangla band Cactus at Swabhumi on Friday. She was  there to gift a replica of an artefact, at a function  organised by Halo Heritage. Picture by Aranya Sen Its Kamasutra Fortnight at Oxford  Bookstore, from June 23 to July 4.

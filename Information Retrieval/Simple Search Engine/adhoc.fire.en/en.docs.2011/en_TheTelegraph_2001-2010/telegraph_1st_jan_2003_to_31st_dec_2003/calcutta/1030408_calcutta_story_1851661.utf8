				 																																										Waldorf,  one of the oldest eateries in the city, functioning under  an eviction threat for close to three years now, is set to  down shutters from Tuesday. The gourmet landmark on Park Street  since 1947 was slapped an eviction notice in mid-2000 by landlady  Urmila Devi Poddar, seeking to build a commercial highrise  on the plot. The restaurant management appealed against the  eviction order and obtained a permanent injunction from  a high court division bench. The landlady subsequently went  to the Supreme Court to overturn the injunction and her appeal  was upheld last week. It is learnt that Poddar will come to  take possession of the premises on Tuesday morning, accompanied  by the police. Although the restaurant management closed shop  on Monday night itself, the 70-odd workers have vowed to resist  the eviction. We will fight any attempt to forcibly take  over the restaurant premises, said Noor Mohammed, the oldest  worker in Waldorf and general secretary of the Citu-affiliated  City Eating and Refreshment Workers Union. Owner of the restaurant  Charles Mantosh said: We have appealed to the government  to consider the interest of the staff. 				 																																										No trace of nitric acid was found in the 44 samples of cottage cheese (chhana) tested in the civic food laboratory. According to the report submitted by the public analyst, only two samples were found sub-standard in terms of water and fat content. Following complaints from consumer groups that nitric acid was used instead of citric acid or calcium lactate to curdle milk to prepare cottage cheese sold at the Bowbazar chhana patty, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the police enforcement branch conducted a joint raid in the market on March 11 and collected the samples. 				 																																										Justice Sujit Burman Roy of Calcutta High Court on Monday passed an order staying the proceedings of a CBI court against an employee of a nationalised bank in south Calcutta. A CBI inquiry was initiated against Dibyendu Narayan Chowdhury in 1982, but during the past 20 years, the investigating agency could not produce enough witnesses before the court. The employees counsel, Rabi Shankar Chaterjee, filed a case in the high court, demanding quashing of all proceedings against his client. The lawyer also informed the court that after harassment by the employer bank, Chowdhurys wife and son left him and he lost his mental balance. Justice Roy directed the CBI court to produce all documents.				 																																										Kalpana Seth, a 70-year-old resident of SP Mukherjee Road, was run over by a private bus on route 205 in front of Bhowanipore police station on Monday morning. She was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries. The driver of the bus fled.				 																																										Dipak Ghotecha, booked for 25 cases of snatching, was sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment by a Fast Track Court at Alipore on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Saturday, December 13, 2003 				 City Lights
				 Sitting pretty in Tollywood				 Raveena Tandon in  full regalia as Chhoto Bou for Sahib, Biwi, Ghulam.  Picture by Aranya Sen Shes running a temperature   which she rarely does. Shes bedecked and bejewelled like  a Bangali bou in a zamindar home of a hundred years  ago  which she now is. She is giving a painstaking shot  of filling her maang with sindoor  which  she will be doing for real in two months time. She is glued  to the cellphone between shots, frantically trying to give  dates  to her father and brother for her marriage in February.				 																																																											Amidst the fever and the fret, at Technicians Studio, you would expect Raveena Tandon to be on the edge when she sits down for a chat on rickety studio plastic chair on the sets of Sahara Manoranjans Sahib, Biwi, Ghulam. But apart from the occasional jiggle of a left leg  that normally makes the cash registers jingle, but is now ensconced in a heavy green Benarasi saree  there is not a hint of hassle.				 																																																											One reason could be that she is having a great time during her first stint in Tollygunge. In fact, Ravs is raving about most things Bengal and people Bengali she has encountered as Bimal Mitras Chhoto Bou. Bengal has, in a sense, ruled the Hindi film industry So many talented people have contributed in so many ways, she says, before embarking on a matter-of-fact eulogy of working in the city of Ray and Ghatak.				 																																																											Just being here has been so enriching. One constantly gets to hear of how the masters of cinema used to work. I have learnt of so many Bengali films that are great but I hadnt even heard the names of, like Ritwik Ghataks fascinating film on the car, how do you pronounce it, A jan. (Ajantrik)... I am picking up many such films that I will watch one by one. Im sure they will help me immensely in learning the craft of cinema, so essential now that I have plunged into production.				 																																																											The lights are switched off as the next shot is being readied, but Raveena, radiant in the line of a solitary beam from a room behind her, carries on: The other thing that strikes one immediately here is the way people behave with artistes. Most of them are so soft-spoken and polite, whereas in a Bombay studio everyone seems to be shouting and you can hardly hear yourself speak. Here, the culture is truly different.				 																																																											And shes not to be drawn out and Stumped by any Tollywood bash-up ball you toss up. I havent had any problems, though to be honest I havent explored too much. And contrary to what I had been warned of, things have worked like clockwork; Pallavi (Chatterjee) has been one of the most hard-working and committed producers I have worked with. So, no complaints.				 																																																											This is a phase in which Raveena has few complaints. Talk of her being visibly in love  with producer Anil Thadani, who has just called again on her cell  and you can hear her smile in the dark, just as the lights decide to come back on, glittering on the gold strands in her hair, shining on a streak of sindoor on her forehead, lighting up her famed features. This is a transition phase Its a fabulous feeling.				 																																									 The city is abuzz with the celebrations coming its way in the form of the UK amp; Kolkata week. The fest, which kicked off on Friday, will include much more than the much-talked about carnival. Another treat in store is a performance by the internationally-acclaimed Kaash, a contemporary dance-kathak fusion from the UK, choreographed by Akram Khan. Five dancers, including Khan, will perform at Kala Mandir on Friday at 6.30 pm. 				 																																																											The London-born Khan, who is of Bangladeshi descent, has worked with Pandit Ravi Shankar in The Jungle Book and in Peter Brooks Mahabharata, and is now associated with the Royal Festival Hall. Nitin Sawhney who has previously collaborated with Talvin Singh has composed the music for the 2002 production. The Calcutta show is part of a four-city tour of India. Dalhousie Institute lit up for Christmas. On Saturday  evening, traditional designs of the festival will come  to light accompanied by carols at the club. Picture  by Pradip Sanyal 				 																																									 The winter of 2003 promises to have a French feel. The Alliance Francaise de Calcutta has lined up a host of events to add excitement to the citys cultural calendar. Says director Nicolas Blasquez: The ties between the two countries go back a long time. And now, more than ever, India is in fashion in France. 				 																																																											First up is a puppet show Never For Ever by Brigitte Revelli on Monday. The show will be based on stories from Panchatantra and its influence on the world of poet Jean de la Fontaine. The fables will be brought alive through colourful masks and puppets, while chants and musical instruments will add voice and emotions to them. On Tuesday, singer Pascal Heni, who is romancing Bollywood round the country, will take the microphone at GD Birla Sabhagar. From the stage to the world of letters on Wednesday, with Daniel Pennac, a frontline author, launching a translation of his thriller The Fairy Gunmother at Oxford Bookstore.				 																																																											The Cine Club of Alliance Francaise de Calcutta is rolling again. Its next screening, Louis Malles Ascenseur pour lechafaud, with unforgettable music by Miles Davis, is slated for January 9 at Nandan III. If the response is good, we will increase the frequency to twice a month, Blasquez says. The programmes will coincide with the visit of French ambassador to India Dominique Girard, who will inaugurate a painting exhibition by Anju Chaudhuri at Birla Academy of Art and Culture and decorate Mahasveta Devi as Officier des Arts and des Lettres on Wednesday.				 																																									 Calcutta has always been the mecca of rock n roll, seeing an eclectic mix of bands  from live acts to solo dance bands since the late 60s. All this seems to have made a tremendous impact on the Bengali youth over the past few years, some of whom have created a new genre of rock music, Bangla rock  some hard, some soft, some even folksy. On December 20, for the first time, English and Bangla rock bands will come together and play on one stage for a cause. 				 																																																											Called aptly the IngoBongo RockShok, its a charity concert to help raise funds for a new NGO, Animal Relief amp; Care Society. The NGO plans to buy an ambulance, set up a clinic and operate a 24x7 helpline to care for the citys homeless animals. Playing for a song are Calcuttas leading rock bands Bhoomi, Chandrabindoo and Hip Pocket. Before the concert, there will be a panel discussion on How animal-friendly is Calcuttas urban life? Sabyasachi Feluda Chakraborty, June Maliah and Bikram Ghosh are expected to be part of the panel, besides other personalities.				 																																																											Participants will have to send in the first chapter of the book by January 20, 2004. The three chosen entries, to be declared on March 1, will win Rs 10,000, Rs 6,000 and Rs 4,000. The winning chapters will be published online for readers to comment. The three writers will have to submit their complete books by May 31.				 																																																											The results will be declared on July 8, 2004, and the book will be available on the Internet from July 18. The winner will also receive Rs 50,000, with Rs 30,000 and Rs 20,000 for the first and second runners-up.				 																																																											The panel of judges includes Sudha Murthy, chairman, Infosys Foundation, and authors Gita Hariharan, Anita Nair, Shashi Deshpande and Aniruddha Bahal. So get those creative juices flowing and pen your thoughts.

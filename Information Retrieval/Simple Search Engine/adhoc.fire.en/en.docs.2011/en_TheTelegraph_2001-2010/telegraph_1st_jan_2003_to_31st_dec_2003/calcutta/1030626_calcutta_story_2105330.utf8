  Lying in wait: A cable on Camac Street where Amit Dalmia (below) met with an untimely death. bottles to freedom (Metro, May 22) was disturbing reading. One may be amazed at 24-year-old Sajal Barui, who shot to public notoriety after killing off his entire family as a teen, living a life and pulling off operations worthy of villains in a Bollywood flick. But a convict serving a life sentence winning his freedom with two bottles of beer does call for flak all around. Are the security guards so cheaply purchased for just a bottle of beer each? If such is the security standard of Calcutta jails then many more Sajal Baruish acts will keep cropping up. It is high time that security guards become more serious and sincere in their duties. Will the authorities concerned see to it that such incidents do not recur?T.R. the police took to reach the Dalmias (Six days to reach Dalmia house, Metro, May 19). As the count of death traps on city roads is on, the onus falls on the law enforcing authorities to identify the parties accountable for these hazards. The case should be acted on instantly. Otherwise the evidence may cease to exist with time. Moreover, bringing the guilty to book may provide some solace to the bereaved family members. Piyal Mukherjee,Lake to the report Capitulation to capitation fee (Metro, May 30), SFI, the students wing of the ruling Reds, have expressed no objection to realising capitation fees from students seeking admission to engineering and medical degree courses. After resisting capitation fees for long, it is an irony of fate that the Marxists have to swallow their own words. Rabindra Nath drug peddlers and promoters in the apparently peaceful Salt Lake area (Drug money behind Salt Lake business boom, Metro, May 26). The recent episode of peddlers taking shelter in a former CBI chiefs house points to the fact that these undesirable elements hold sway in the area. Most promoters operating here have dubious records. The need of the hour is to monitor the activities of tenants. Tathagata  Apropos the Metro report Army targets Maidan mess (May 31), unauthorised shops have sprung up around the long distance bus terminal with the patronage of political parties. It is a welcome move if the army, which owns the land, initiates a clean-up.Govinda to showcase atrocities on victims of domestic violence (Voices of violence victims, in words and tunes, Metro, May 29). Kunal drive aged, ailing to despair (Metro, May 26), as the onus of responsibility for the unauthorised power consumption has not been fixed, the punishment should not have been inflicted on the other innocent consumers. Deba Kaur in ICSE and ISC (Valiant tread in marks march, Metro, May 27), despite their poverty, was praiseworthy. The government should help them for higher studies.Mohan Lal Sarkar,Budge Budge.

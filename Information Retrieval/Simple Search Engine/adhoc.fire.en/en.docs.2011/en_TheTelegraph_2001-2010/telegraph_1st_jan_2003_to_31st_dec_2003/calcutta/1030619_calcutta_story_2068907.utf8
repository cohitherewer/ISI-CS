 Thursday, June 19, 2003 				 Rain drill to avert road risks
 																											- Police draw up car checklist for motorists as monsoon sets in A STAFF REPORTER																								In the wake of a road mishap last week, in which a taxi skidded off the rain-soaked carriageway, mounted the pavement and crushed a college girl, the city police are working on steps to avert accidents during the monsoon.																								 In the coming weeks, the traffic wing will tutor vehicle-owners across the city on the need to adopt more care on wet streets.																								Officials said that as part of this tutorial, the traffic police will distribute pamphlets and stickers to vehicle-owners and drivers, asking them to get their cars checked and overhauled before they hit the road. We are requesting drivers and owners to check their car tyres  specially the front wheels  as also the functioning of the wipers, rear-view mirrors and the rear lights. Any violation of our campaign will draw strict penal action, warned deputy commissioner (traffic) M.K. Singh. 																								A survey report, prepared after the last years monsoon, revealed that many vehicles on the road either had no wipers or dysfunctional ones. The tyres were not fit for the monsoon streets and a good number of vehicles didnt have rear-view mirrors, said a traffic department official.																								Last year, a number of pre-monsoon mishaps had forced the traffic wing to launch a crackdown. As a result, 12,565 vehicles were penalised for faulty wipers, 6,536 for defective tyres, and 5,900 for not having indicator lights. Besides, legal action was taken against 1,294 vehicles for defective lights and 1,845 for not having rear-view mirrors. Our intention is not to harass the people, but to make them aware of the necessity of these gadgets during the rains, said the deputy commissioner. 																								The police are also preparing a list of roads prone to waterlogging. Last year, Rabindra Sarani remained submerged for over a month. CR Avenue, Strand Road, MG Road, Beleghata Main Road, Southern Avenue and Gariahat Road, too, were submerged for a long period. This year, we will tell motorists the roads that may be waterlogged and the alternative route to take, Singh added.

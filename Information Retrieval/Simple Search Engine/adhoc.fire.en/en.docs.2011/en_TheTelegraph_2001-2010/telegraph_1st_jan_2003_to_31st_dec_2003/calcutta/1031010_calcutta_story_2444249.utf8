 Friday, October 10, 2003 				 Cops lose getaway gangster
 SAMARPAN DUTTA																								Officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), assigned the job of netting gangster Sheikh Binod after his escape from Dum Dum Central jail, were hot on his heels on Wednesday night but failed to trip him. The team raided houses in Jadavpur and Sonarpur police station areas on a tip-off about Binods whereabouts. 																								According to a senior CID officer, Binod was spotted on Wednesday morning in the Tollygunge area with two associates, Raju Singh and Rajesh Khan (another extortionist operating in central Calcutta and one of the four who fled with Binod from jail). We were told he was living in the area but our officers failed to locate him. But we are sure he is somewhere on the southern fringes of the city, the officer added.																								Police said a man who knew Binod recognised him when the fugitive hailed a yellow taxi at the crossing of Bikramgarh, in Golf Green, at about 9 am on Wednesday. The driver told Binod he was from Munger, Bihar. Binod asked the driver the distance to Patna from Calcutta and how long it would take to reach. The driver told him Patna was 500 km away, and he could cover the distance in less than 10 hours. Binod let the taxi go and boarded another to head for Jadavpur, police added.																								CID and police officers are stationed at all exit points of the city. The Mokama Express that left Howrah on Wednesday was also scanned to prevent Binod from fleeing to Bihar.

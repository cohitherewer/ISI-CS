	The number of open manholes is increasing by the day in  the city. The one in front of Punjab National Bank in Salt  Lake poses a serious threat to vehicles and pedestrians.  Local residents, including the elderly and children, can  be dragged into a mishap during their early morning stroll.  The municipal authorities have not even bothered to put  a warning sign near the hole. 
	 Rimli Datta, Salt Lake.  
	A large portion of the south-eastern flank of Rashbehari  crossing has been occupied by fast food stalls and street-dwellers.  There is hardly any space left on the footpath in front  of Muktangan. One can find the squatters carrying out daily  chores on the kerb with their families  cooking, bathing  and washing. In the evenings, mosquito nets are tied across  the breadth of the footpath. A pay-and-use toilet, set up  recently near the Southern Avenue boulevard, remains unused  as a nearby tap flowing round-the-clock serves their purpose.  
	Asit Kumar Mitra, Southern Avenue.

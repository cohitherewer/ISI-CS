The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Thursday, April 24, 2003 				 Box-makers pitch for analog option
 A STAFF REPORTER CAS count An analog box can carry  up to 99 channels; a digital one, more than 600 Analog box will cost around  Rs 3,000, but digital decoder wont come for less than Rs  5,000 Analog model entails investment  of Rs 20 lakh at MSOs end, against Rs 2.5 crore for a digital  platform While the analog system  is robust, a digital signal is highly sensitive, requiring  significant upgradation of the operators last-mile network																								Even as debate on the magic box  its price range and procurement options  rages in cable homes across the city, overseas makers of the decoder, which will bring the pop pay channels into drawing rooms from July 15, feel its wiser to start off with the analog model.																								Its a myth that analog boxes are easily hacked and that a digital box cant be decoded. We are setting up a facility in Mumbai to manufacture 100,000 analog set-top boxes a month and are sure Calcutta will account for a sizeable portion of that production, said Jerry Hor, president of Eastern Electronics Co. Ltd of Taiwan. Eastern, a leading name in Asia in conditional access hardware, makes both analog and digital boxes. Hor, who was in town for a presentation at the two-day seminar on CAS organised by the Cable TV Equipments Traders amp; Manufacturers Association, stressed that an analog platform was most suited to India, at least in the initial phase of CAS implementation.																								Dalvi, a UK-based maker of decoders, also feels the analog box is the best start-up option in India, and is quite bullish about business in Calcutta. Consumers in this city are extremely price-conscious, and would think thrice, maybe four times, before investing in a digital box, which wont come for anything below Rs 5,000, said Ashutosh Nigam, local dealer for Dalvi.																								Lewis Zimbler of the UK firm, which is setting up a 40,000-per-month manufacturing facility in Chandigarh, said: Our analog decoders are running in various countries in Europe and Latin America and there hasnt been a single report of hacking till now. Besides, the digital box is not really sacrosanct, as anything which is encoded can be decoded, he emphasised.																								While an analog box can carry up to 99 channels, a digital box has the capacity to decode 600-plus channels. But most manufacturers felt Calcutta is not ready for the digital investment yet. Not only is the cost of the box higher, the last-mile operator will have to invest at least Rs 1,500 on each subscriber to upgrade his network. How many cable operators can afford that? asked a representative of a decoder manufacturer.																								While the initial demand has to be met through imports, the manufacturers are confident of getting their India operations on stream soon. Orders from Calcutta have been particularly encouraging, and we feel the level of preparedness among the service providers here is very good, observed Hor.																								Pawan Jajodia, chairman of the CAS seminar committee, felt 20 to 25 per cent of cable homes in Calcutta would opt for the set-top box from Day One of CAS itself.

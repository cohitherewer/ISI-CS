The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, May 14, 2003 K.S. Rajendrakumar								Principal secretary, department of urban development, government of West Bengal																																							If the basic infrastructure is not there for walking smoothly (hawker-free pavements and zebra crossings), then implementation of penal measures becomes difficult. Even then, pedestrians cannot be allowed to cross roads wherever they please. In areas where there are no zebra crossings, traffic policemen have to use their discretion about whether to fine a person or not. Charging fines instils discipline among pedestrians.

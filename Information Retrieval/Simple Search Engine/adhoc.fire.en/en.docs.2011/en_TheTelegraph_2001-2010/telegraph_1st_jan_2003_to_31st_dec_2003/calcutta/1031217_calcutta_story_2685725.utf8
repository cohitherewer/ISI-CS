 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Bank heist while staff wait
 																											- Robbers pose as early customers, clear out with Rs 85 lakh A STAFF REPORTER																								While cricket fever was at its peak in June, robbers had struck at the Gariahat branch of Punjab National Bank. Tuesday morning saw a rerun. Armed men pulled off the biggest bank heist in recent times while the nation watched on TV the Indian cricketers set a different kind of record in Australia. The robbers cleared Central Bank of Indias Kidderpore branch of Rs 85 lakh.																								Six men, posing as customers, entered the bank in Kidderpore before many of its staff had arrived, and even mingled with the crowd for more than an hour, after pulling off the heist without firing a single shot.																								Assuring the frightened customers that they had nothing to fret about though they had come to loot the bank, the robbers took out the SIM cards from customers mobile phones. They left assuring the staff that they would inform the local police station (Watgunge) about the robbery. Police stations throughout the state have been alerted and given sketches of the suspects faces. But with the earlier robbers still eluding the police, theres little promise of the cops netting Tuesdays goons.																								The spate of bank robberies this year in and around the city began in June with the heists at the Sagar Gramin Banks Jyangra branch (Rs 13 lakh was looted) and at the PNB. A few months later, the Bhowanipore branch of Punjab amp; Sind Bank was robbed of Rs 10 lakh. Probes have not yielded any clues.																								The six men armed with revolvers walked into the bank on Diamond Harbour Road at 9.30 am and overpowered the lone securityman. Cartridges were removed from his rifle, but returned politely after the operation. Two robbers stopped a cleaner trying to escape.																								Four bank employees, who had reported for work a little early, were told to shut up as the gang waited for the cashier and the manager to arrive. A few customers, who had turned up, were escorted to a corner. There will be no transaction today, as we have come to loot the bank, a robber said in Hindi. When bank manager Shankar Mohan Banerjee entered around 10 am, a revolver was jammed to his head and the keys to the strong-room and the vault were taken away.																								Two robbers carrying empty gunny-bags entered the strong-room and cleared it, while another stood guard. Banerjee, his staff and the customers were ordered inside the strong-room. No one saw the robbers leave. It was left to a trader to hear the cries from the strong-room and call in the police. The bank hooter had been switched off.

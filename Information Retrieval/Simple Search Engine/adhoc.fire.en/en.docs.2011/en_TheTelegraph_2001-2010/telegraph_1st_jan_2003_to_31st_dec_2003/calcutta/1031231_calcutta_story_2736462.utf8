		 Wednesday, December 31, 2003 JOY GOSWAMI								Writer																																							I do not think so. What a writer needs is friendly and fruitful discussions with people he or she trusts. I make it a point to discuss my novels and my poems at the manuscript stage with a few people whose opinions I value. Often, such discussions enrich my work. The minute such an exchange of ideas is formalised, it could impede rather than improve the creative process.

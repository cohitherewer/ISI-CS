 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police on Friday temporarily withdrew permission to Senbo Engineering  the main contractor of the Gariahat and Park Street flyovers  to work at the Esplanade four-point intersection till it met its other construction commitments.																								The engineering firm had taken over a major portion of Lenin Sarani and Jawaharlal Nehru Road, off Metro cinema, on Thursday and cordoned off the stretch with tin sheets. Kajal Sengupta of Senbo said the spot had been barricaded to begin levelling the road. There is a sharp drop in the road surface on the spot, which slows down traffic and increases risks of an accident.																								Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) M.K. Singh said Senbo has been directed to demolish the tin structure. According to Singh, Senbo has failed to keep its word on completing the slip road from opposite American Center, running parallel to Jawaharlal Nehru Road. It has not completed the Y-road from Rani Rashmoni Road to Esplanade, either. With no alternative avenue to distribute the traffic after it cordoned off the four-point intersection, it would have been suicidal for the police to let Senbo go ahead with work at Esplanade, he said. 																								Kajal Sengupta, however, disagreed. The transport department recently settled the dispute and gave us the go-ahead to start construction, he said. Denying that Senbo was responsible for any delay, Sengupta alleged that the transport department had taken time to sort out the problems that cropped up while constructing the slip road.																								A Metro Railway structure was coming in the way and after much discussion, it was recently decided to flatten it and lay pre-cast slabs, Sengupta said. The CESC has to remove a transformer, too. We were directed to start work on the slip road in the first week of March. It will take four months to lay the road. It will be operational by July, he added.																								On non-completion of the Y-road, Sengupta said tram tracks at the Rani Rashmoni Road end need to be levelled and concrete slabs at the Esplanade side demolished, and the transport department was taking its time to arrive at a decision.

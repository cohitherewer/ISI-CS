The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, December 24, 2003 				 Display ban on Bypass
 A STAFF REPORTER																								There will be no posters, billboards or festoons  eyesores or eye-catchers  around Parama Island, on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, any more.																								The step to ensure that this vital link to the city, next to Science City, wears a cleaner, and safer, look was spelt out by the government on Tuesday. State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya announced this and a number of other projects for a better-looking city and a beautiful riverfront.																								We are appealing to all political parties and other organisations not to put up posters, billboards and festoons at Parama Island. The police have been asked to remove the boards that have already been erected there, added Bhattacharya.																								The minister made it clear that the government meant business in this billboard battle, as the visual pollution in this part of the city was endangering drivers and pedestrians alike. The area is becoming extremely accident-prone, said Bhattacharya. The no-display ban, he added, would apply to everything, from Gita paath to Marxbadi paath (religious discourse to political sermons).																								An order has already been penned to pull down around 83 illegal billboards. We have decided to remove all billboards put up without proper sanction. These are mostly on CMDA and CMC plots, the minister said.																								The government has also decided to authorise the deputy commissioner (traffic) of Calcutta Police for permission to put up a billboard on the Bypass. Even though the authority concerned is the CMC, permission has to be sought from DC (traffic), Bhattacharya added.																								Off the Bypass, the government has decided to build a service road between Beleghata and Ultadanga for pedestrians and two-wheelers. Encroachers have been asked to evacuate by January 10, or face ouster, said minister Bhattacharya.																								On the waterfront, Bhattacharya announced a festival on the Hooghly from December 30. Union shipping minister Shatrughan Sinha will be chief guest and will also visit the four warehouses to be revamped  Armenian, Canning, Clive and Strand. 																								Sinha is expected to announce the handover of a 300-metre Calcutta Port Trust stretch north of Millennium Park to the CMDA for beautification.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Post-graduates in comparative literature from Jadavpur University (JU) can now look forward to securing teaching posts in under-graduate colleges.																								Responding to a long-standing demand of JUs students, the state government finally set up a committee last week to examine the possibility of recruiting the universitys post-graduates in comparative literature for teaching English or Bengali in under-graduate colleges affiliated to various universities.																								 JUs students and authorities had been long seeking a government nod for post-graduates in comparative literature to take the state-level eligibility test (SLET), held every year for recruiting teachers to the 340-odd state-aided colleges in Bengal.																								The students demand was placed for discussion at a meeting of the West Bengal Council for Higher Education last week. A solution has been hanging fire for a long time. A four-member committee will examine the comparative literature syllabus followed by the university and submit its report to the government as early as possible, said Nirmalya Banerjee, deputy secretary of the council.																								The committee comprises Amiya Deb, a former teacher of JUs comparative literature, Pabitra Sarkar, also a former teacher of the same department of JU and former vice-chairman of the state higher education council, Surabhi Banerjee, former teacher of English at Calcutta University and now vice-chancellor of Netaji Subhas Open University, and Benoy Banerjee, also a teacher of comparative literature at JU.																								Higher education department sources said the government would not allow comparative literature students to seek teaching posts in colleges because JU is the only institution in the state that offers under-graduate and post-graduate courses in the subject.																								If comparative literature post-graduates take up posts in colleges, they can teach either English or Bengali only, said an official. But the state felt the syllabi of the two subjects were not adequately dealt with in JUs comparative literature course.																								Resistance from universities that offered full-fledged courses in English and Bengali was another factor that had led to the bar on JUs comparative literature graduates. The universities felt it would reduce the job opportunities for their students.

		 Monday, June 23, 2003 				 Hellish access to healthcare zone
		 The entrance to Chittaranjan  Seva Sadan, cluttered up by tea-stalls and a garbage  vat. Pictures by Kishor Roy Chowdhury Sudarshan Roy: The entrance  to Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, on Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road,  is blocked by a big vat, a urinal and a number of tea-stalls.  The stench is unbearable. Patients and their relatives can  hardly enter or leave the hospital. Can these obstructions  be removed?																																																													I request you to give me that complaint in writing so that I can take steps. I feel that every hospital, its compound and surroundings must be kept clean. No one should be allowed to dirty the zone around a hospital.

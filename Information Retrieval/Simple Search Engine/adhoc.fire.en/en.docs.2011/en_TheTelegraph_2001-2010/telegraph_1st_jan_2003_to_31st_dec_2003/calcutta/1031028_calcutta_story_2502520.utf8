Thomas Higgins, president and CEO, Best Western International of the US, will deliver the keynote address. He will highlight the emerging challenges facing the global hospitality industry and offer his views on strategies to meet these challenges and to achieve the desired growth.																								The convention will provide the opportunity to prospective entrepreneurs to invest in eastern India, including West Bengal, which will have a multiplier effect on the economy, stressed FHRAI president S.K. Khullar.																								The three-day hospitality summit will host two significant interactive sessions. The first will be held with the state and central tourism departments. The second, to foster better coordination among different segments of the industry, will feature representatives of the three sectors  hotels, travel agents and tour operators.																								The presidents of the four major associations  FHRAI, Hotel Association of India (HAI), Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) and Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO)  will form the panel for this session.																								Keeping in mind the boom in restaurant business and the growing trend of eating out, FHRAI has organised a session on Success factors for new restaurants, with Cyrus Todiwala as the lead speaker.																								The Hotels amp; Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI), along with its national parent body, have suggested various steps to the state government for effective development of this high-yield industry like creating total tourism awareness with integrated communication systems and strategy, proper infrastructure development and other basic amenities. An advisory council was also mooted for the development of tourism in West Bengal.																								We have also told the chief minister we are ready to create an international-standard hotel management institute in Calcutta to be run by the association, if the government provides us with the 8-10 acres of land needed for the venture. We will raise the issue again at the national convention, said S.S. Kothari, president of HRAEI.																								To be held alongside the convention, an exhibition  Hospitality India 2003  will showcase various items connected with the hotels and restaurants industry, like kitchen equipment, cutlery, crockery, housekeeping and laundry equipment, furniture and electronic gadgets used in the industry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, December 08, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	A bronze statue of Mahatma Gandhi, installed off Park Street  in the early 1950s, was shifted to Mayo Road during the  Metro Railway construction in the Maidan area. It was decided  that the statue would be returned to its original site once  work got over. Many years have passed since then but the  statue remains where it is. Cant it be brought back to  Park Street crossing?  
	Prahlad Agarwala, Majdia.  
	Malaria looms large over Lake Town, Bangur, Dum Dum Park  and the adjoining areas. Several canals and ponds of the  locality have become cradles for mosquitoes.  
	B.N. Bose, Dum Dum.

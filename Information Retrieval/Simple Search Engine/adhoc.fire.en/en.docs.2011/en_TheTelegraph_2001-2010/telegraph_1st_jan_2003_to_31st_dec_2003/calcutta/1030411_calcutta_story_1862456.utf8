				 																																										Large  areas of north Calcutta have been reeling under massive power  failure since Tuesday following a fault in a six-KV feeder  line between Khanna cinema and Fariapukur. As a result, residents  of Shyambazar, Fariapukur and the adjoining areas had to go  without fans or air-conditioners in the sweltering heat. Multi-storeyed  buildings also faced a water shortage as electric pumps were  rendered inoperative. A CESC spokesman said the feeder was  repaired four times but each time the fault recurred. He said  CESC engineers were busy with the repairs. Power supply is  expected to be restored by Thursday night.

 Ever popular: Growing up with books  The Net takes over from the TV  in most students lives, with few bookworms sticking to  the printed word. Thats why Time to Talk asked readers:  Would you rather read a printed book than an e-book on  screen? But these letters show some guys and gals still  value books, the good, old-fashioned way: When people need to relax, they  would be more comfortable reaching for a printed book rather  than logging on. Sitting in front of a screen, straining  eyes to read every word seems more like work than fun. I  prefer browsing through the yellowed pages of a favourite  classic or leafing through the latest Harry Potter.  Printed books are handy, portable and sometimes of great  personal value and e-books can never take their place.				 				 																															Shreya Sarkar,				 				 																															G.D. Birla Centre For Education I would opt for a printed book  rather than an electronic one as print has the power to  make the subject appealing to the reader. A real book means  much more to the person to whom it belongs. They can be  given as presents and may act as a bridge for friendship.  A book can change and inspire. Not only does an e-book lack  the same spirit, they are still not easily accessible to  all.				 				 																															Amitava Dasgupta,				 				 																															Ist year, Future Institute of Engineering amp; Management Printed books are easier on the  eye. They allow us to get involved with the characters and  absorbed by the plot.				 				 																															Megha Jalan,				 				 																															M.B. Girls Printed books will always be my  first choice. They are more engrossing. While reading an  e-book, one has to look at a screen for long periods of  time, which is not good for the eyes. One also has sit still  to read an e-book, whereas a printed book can be carried  around.				 				 																															Kamalika Chaudhuri,				 				 																															Class XI, arts, Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan I would prefer a printed book  to an e book. A book can be a persons best companion. Unless  one can afford a laptop, an e-book can never take its place.				 				 																															Rashi Daga,				 				 																															Class IX, Modern High  I keep on moving from room to  room with a book in hand, so a printed book is the thing  for me.				 				 																															Manan Agarwal,				 				 																															Ist year, St Xaviers College E-books available on the Net are  usually excerpts, so I would not like to waste my time reading  them.				 				 																															Sananda Sen,				 				 																															IIIrd Year, Asutosh College Its better to read a printed  book as one can go through the whole book quickly without  loosing any time.				 				 																															Anil Agarwal,				 				 																															Calcutta University Reading is a habit inculcated  from childhood. The pleasure one gets in reading a printed  book is not the same with an e-book. I can read those books  whenever I want, with no hassles and no strain on the eye.				 				 																															Vineeta Nair,				 				 																															Class XII, Modern High  I prefer real books to e-books.  We all like doing things that involve touch and feel,  just as it is more fun looking at photographs than digital  versions on the computer.				 				 																															Mihika Singh Verma,				 				 																															Class X, Loreto House All things e may be the craze,  but printed books are not going anywhere. Its much easier  to read a book in print than stare at the PC for a long  time. It would be great to have e-versions of rare books  and then take printouts. One can read reviews in the electronic  media but not the whole book itself.				 				 																															Aparajita Dasgupta, Asutosh College E-books come with a host of advantages.  Important words or lines come with hyperlinks, thus relieving  us from the toil of searching through reference books. But  despite this, e-books can never replace printed books.				 				 																															Sharmistha Dan,				 				 																															Class XI, Shri Shikshayatan				 				 																															lDespite the hype about e-books, I dont think they are real substitutes for conventional printed books.				 				 																															Piyal Mukherjee,				 				 																															1st Year, Institute of Engineering and Management				 				 																															lWith printed books, the eyes and brain are the only processors needed! Tech gurus claim e-books will eventually wipe out printed books. But, beneath the simplistic facade of print lies the feeling of permanence, the texture of paper, the smell of fresh ink, the heft of the volume in ones hand  things that an e-book can never have. Admittedly, e-books are useful and fun, but when it comes to communicating ideas and emotions, it is the good old printed book, that remains the eternal favourite.				 				 																															Name not given				 				 																															lReading is not only entertainment, but it also expands the knowledge base. Many rich Bengali novels are available only in hard copy. Also, reading an entire book on screen would consume electricity. Why waste so much just to be hi-tech? Just grab a heart-melting novel and read on!				 				 																															Priyanka Sil,				 				 																															Class IX, Holy Child School A relief station is what the kids at Ahlladi call  their weekend dance destination. Twenty kids from east  Calcutta slums come to the Nagerbazar centre to learn  a mix of formal and experimental dance moves, conducted  by Prayasam, an NGO. They will present three items on  April 19 to commemorate Ahlladis fifth anniversary.  Picture by Aranya Sen				 				 																															Fun fest The department of law, Calcutta  University, organised its intercollege social, Sampriti  on April 4. Competitive events like debate, quiz, antakshari  and sports like badminton, table tennis, carrom and athletics  were held through the day, which ended with Utpalendu Chowdhury  and Raghav Chattopadhyay upping the musical tempo. The festive action continued at  the Centenary Hall at CU the following day, for Show-Journ,  the second annual fest of the mass communication and journalism  department. After the ceremonial start with senior mediapersons,  the events started. The theme was pro-peace, with performances  dubbed Pathway to Peace and a Sahara-y-Saddam. Bands  Sparsha and Anonymous concluded the days fun.				 				 																															 Srinwanti Das amp; Sutirtha Sengupta				 				 																
	 Gender talk				 				 																															The Womens Studies department of Jadavpur University held a seminar on Gender and Culture recently, throwing light on the condition of women, from ancient to modern times, rural to urban settings. Womens changing place in public education, lack of representation in political bodies, their role in ethnic movements and the censor boards inaction against regressive stereotypes were some of the subjects discussed on Day I. Jasodhara Bagchi started off the second days proceedings with a paper on gender and partition. Womens conditions in border areas and panchayats, the attitude towards domestic help and politically correct speech followed.

	 Puja awards				 				 																															Howrahs Bantra Rajlakshmi Balika Vidyalaya won first place in the Parle Saraswati Vandana 2003. The award, for the best Saraswati Puja held in a school, was given away on April 4, Nazrul Mancha. The judges visited over 300 schools in Calcutta, Howrah, Siliguri and Durgapur, grading on pandal design, idol, student participation, ambience, discipline and decoration. Bijoygarh Siksha Niketan for Girls, Calcutta and Siliguri Girls High School were jointly awarded second prize. Shibpur Hindu Girls School, B Zone Steel Town Girls High School, Durgapur and Naraindass Bangur Memorial Multipurpose School, Calcutta, followed in third place.				 				 																
	 Rocking start				 				 																															Another band has jumped onto the bandwagon. Trinayan made its debut at the recent function of Uttarayan, a centre for the mentally challenged, held at the Bidyut Bhavan auditorium, Salt Lake. Students Shoumya, Prithviraj, Sharbajit and Genia brought with them a breath of fresh air. Still in its nascent stage, this combo from Jadavpur University and Acharya Prafulla Chandra Polytechnic aspires to be different from a conventional five-piece band, with two guitars, an octopad and (what is usually a strict-no-no in band music) a piano accordion. There is no lead singer or musician in our band. We believe this absence of hierarchy builds camaraderie, says Shoumya. 				 				 																															Trinayan started off with a rendition of Knocking on Heavens Door as a reminder of the war before switching to Bengali rock numbers with an impressive original composition, Parashona Karo, thrown in.				 				 																															The band is not gunning for many shows, though offers are coming in. It is now time to consolidate, being selective about gigs. Good music, if not the most popular tunes, is its focus.				 				 																															 Aritro Ganguly,				 				 																															Jadavpur University

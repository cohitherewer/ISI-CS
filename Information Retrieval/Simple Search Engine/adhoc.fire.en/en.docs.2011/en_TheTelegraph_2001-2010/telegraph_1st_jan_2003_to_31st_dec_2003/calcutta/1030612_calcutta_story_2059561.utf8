  More than an earful: Preparations  for a rally The report Wrong report rap on hospital (Metro, May 6) has once again shown how little faith people can put on medical services. Doctors being dragged to consumer courts for negligence in treatment has now become routine. Even after making false professional commitments, they go scot-free just by paying a compensation which could be a bounty to the petitioner but a meagre amount for the culprit doctor.  The District Consumer Redressal Forums verdict in favour of D.P. Mukherjee will set an useful precedent for patients fighting for justice. But is this the only way to deal with the situation? Should the doctors not learn the lessons of humanity and remember the oath they took while getting their MBBS degrees? Awarding compensation is no solution. Trying to put an end to such practices should be the target.  Gunjeet S. Wadhwa,  Rai Bahadur Road.  The report Decibel devil in deaf count (Metro, May 10), was disturbing. Temporary threshold shift (TTS) or temporary hearing loss occurs when a person hears a sudden loud noise. Despite the existence of several laws, the state government has done precious little to control noise pollution. The employees of a nursing home played revolutionary songs over blaring loudspeakers on May Day with utter apathy towards the sufferings of the patients, with the knowledge that no microphones can be played within 100 metres of a silence zone. The day is not far off when a section of the populace will go deaf if the sound pollution remains unchecked.  Mohan Lal Sarkar,  Budge Budge.  It is a pity that todays lifestyle  indulges loud music, be it at parties or during festivals.  Add to that eardrum-splitting speeches of political leaders  at street-corner meetings. It is high time that educationists,  social thinkers and law-enforcing bodies worked in tandem  to stop such health hazards.  Govinda Bakshi,  Budge Budge.  We are delighted to know that Netajis German car will be repaired within January 23, 2004 and we can see the car in running condition on Netajis next birthday (Repair route for great escape car, Metro, May 15) . This historic car is a legacy of the charismatic freedom-fighter and should be a point of attraction for tourists.  Bhupen Bose,  Dum Dum Park.  We are thankful for the article on Darbari (Listen to that voice in song, Metro, June 3). But something of significance needs to be added. Sayani Palit and my son, Anushtoop, are being trained by Chandana Chakraborty, principal of Srutinandan and wife of Pandit Ajay Chakraborty. Panditji does come to class when he can find time but their real guide is Chandana Chakraborty.  Mitali Mazumder,  Salt Lake City.  In Up above the world so high (Metro, June 5), the report mistakenly mentioned the telescope-making workshop as being conducted by the Centre for Space Studies (CSS). It is the Centre for Space Physics (CSP).  ln Now, the right click for you  is just a click away (Metro, June 9) Sanchita Kushari  Bose was mistakenly referred to as Sanchita Kushari Dyson.  This is regarding the article Cop, doctor in tooth tussle on May 30 in Metro about a south Calcutta dental surgeon (Dr D. Ghosh) being sued by a police officer. The full name of the doctor was not mentioned in the article. As I, too, am a dental surgeon by the name of D. Ghosh, the matter has resulted in utter confusion and embarrassment.  Dr Debasish Ghosh,  Chowringhee Road. This is apropos the report Labs test positive for quality lapse (Metro, June 2). With reference to the accreditation of Ashok Laboratory, I had inadvertently omitted to mention that this laboratory has already been accredited by NABL for the discipline of biochemistry.  Dr. A. S. Kanagasabapathy,  Consultant- NABL.

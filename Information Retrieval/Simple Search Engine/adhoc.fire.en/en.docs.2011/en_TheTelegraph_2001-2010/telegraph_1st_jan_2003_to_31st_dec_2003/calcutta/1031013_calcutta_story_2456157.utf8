																								India is a rich and veritable treasure-trove of textiles. Centuries of hard work by talented weavers and craftspeople has helped India reach a glorious height. Indian textiles have always occupied a very special place in the global market. In fact, India was a prominent landmark in the ancient Silk Route. The countrys textile trading history is as ancient as 2000 years or more. Stories and fables of weavers and their hypnotic creations abound. In fact, there is a fable about how Mughal emperor Aurangzeb was livid to see a female member of his harem appear before him in the nude. But in reality, she had draped herself in yards and yards of muslin (an extremely delicately woven textile that is featherweight and transparent)! After all, a muslin was not considered perfect if five yards of it did not pass through a small ring. Sutra, in collaboration with Oxford Bookstore, hosts a definitive collection of textile related books and launches Crafts Maps of India. This Dastkari Haat Samitis publication has been co-ordinated, conceptualised and compiled by Jaya Jaitly. She will be present at the venue to introduce the work.																								When: Today; 6 pm																								Where: Oxford Bookstore, 17, Park Street

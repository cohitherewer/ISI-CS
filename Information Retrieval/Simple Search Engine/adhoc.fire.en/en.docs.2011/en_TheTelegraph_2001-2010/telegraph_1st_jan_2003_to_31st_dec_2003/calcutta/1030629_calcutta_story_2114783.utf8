The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Sunday, June 29, 2003 				 Mayor pledge to unlock gate
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Saturday admitted that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has temporarily stalled the Calcutta Gateway project as deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani would not be able to attend the foundation stone-laying ceremony. 																								But we are determined to carry out the project in the near future, said Mukherjee.																								In another development, the mayor, who is also an MLA from Chowringhee, announced that the Trinamul Congress would continue boycotting the on-going Assembly session. We will skip the entire monsoon session to protest the manner in which the CPM resorted to rigging in the panchayat and the municipal elections, Mukherjee said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Varsha Utsav
  Rabindranath Tagore was not just a poet, he was a great teacher too. He used the Bengali language as his obedient handmaid, always at his beck and call. He moulded the language and created words and phrases to express himself. He also taught us to discover the inherent glory and beauty of nature. Varsha (monsoon) always remained his favourite season and in his creative outflow, he was always partial to this season. Varsha, for him, was a living entity which provided the elixir of life to Earth. After summers gruelling heat and discomfort, the rainy season is a welcome relief. Samaroha hosts a two-day programme of music and recitation based on Tagores works that celebrates the spirit of varsha. Participants include Pramita Mallick, Pubali Debnath, Debaroti Som, Anusheela Basu, Dr Taniya Das, Tanushree Banerjee, Urmila Basu, Suman Panthi, Biswaroop Rudra, Sudeshna Sanyal, Sharmila Mukherjee, Patralekha Mukherjee, Sayantani Chakraborty, Bijoylakshmi Burman and others today and Rajeshwar Bhattacharya, Purba Dam, Bani Tagore, Abhirup Guha Thakurta, Sanghamitra Gupta, Sreeradha Bandopadhyay, Achin Mukhopadhyay, Basabi Dutta, Abhijit Guha, Jhinuk Sengupta, Kajal Sur and others on the concluding evening.When: Today amp; tomorrow at 6 pmWhere:  Copyright

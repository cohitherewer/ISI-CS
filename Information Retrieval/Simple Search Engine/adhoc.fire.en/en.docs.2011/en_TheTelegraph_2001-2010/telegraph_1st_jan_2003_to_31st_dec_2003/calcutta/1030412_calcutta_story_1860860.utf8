 Saturday, April 12, 2003 				 Forensic lab cries secrecy breach
 DEEPANKAR GANGULY																								Secrecy concerns are furrowing brows at the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), a key investigative wing of criminology of the ministry of home affairs, with the adjacent Kabibagan mosque extension touching its outer walls. 																								The extension is being constructed in a manner that makes it look like the mosque is part of the Central government building on 30, Gorachand Road.																								The ministry of home affairs in Delhi has already taken up the matter and requested the state government to intervene, according to minister for minority affairs Md Salim on Thursday.																								When CFSL director V.K. Kashyap demanded that at least four feet of space be kept between the building and the place of worship under reconstruction, Kabibagan mosque mutwali Nishar Ahmed said: We are ready to demolish the controversial portion if the laboratory can prove with documents that we have encroached on their land.																								The Central government building has encroached on our land and we have the documents to prove it, asserted Haji Abdul Aziz, who identified himself as a namazi of the mosque.																								Mutwali Nishar Ahmed claimed the mosque was constructed about 200 years ago by his grandfather, Sheikh Mohammad Ali. It had been a small, single-storey mosque till March this year, when it suddenly turned into a multi-storeyed building.																								On a complaint from the laboratory, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) lodged a complaint at Beniapukur police station. CMC director-general (building) Ashok Roychaudhury claimed construction was being carried out without taking permission from the civic body and in violation of building rules.																								Local CPM legislator and minister for minority affairs Md Salim said: I advised the police not to head for a showdown on the issue and, at the same time, asked the mosque authorities not to turn it into a major issue by involving outsider support.																								The Bureau of Police Research and Development building at 30, Gorachand Road, houses three Central home ministry offices  the Central Detective Training School, Government Examiner of Questions and Documents and the Central Forensic Science Laboratory. 																								The laboratory, on the second floor, is directly affected by the construction, said detective training school principal S.M.I. Azam. Since research activities carried out in this building demand official secrecy, I think the dispute should be settled across the table he added.

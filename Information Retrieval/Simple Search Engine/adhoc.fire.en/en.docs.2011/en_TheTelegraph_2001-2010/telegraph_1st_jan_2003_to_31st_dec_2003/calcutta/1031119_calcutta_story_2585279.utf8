 Wednesday, November 19, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with...				 Sushmita Sen  You are ambitious and nothing will stop you from achieving what you want. Your individuality and independence make you special. You are a great believer in the goodness of people. You are completely selfless when it comes to family and friends. Your social contacts are numerous and help you out of tight spots. Exclusivity is the guiding principle of your life.   Kusum Bhandari

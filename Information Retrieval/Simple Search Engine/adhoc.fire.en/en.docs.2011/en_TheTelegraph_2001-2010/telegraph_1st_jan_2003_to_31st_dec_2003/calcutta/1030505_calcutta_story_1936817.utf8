		 Monday, May 05, 2003 				 Teething trouble for booster station
		 WET WAIT: Barren Utsab Math, handed over  to the civic body for a drinking water booster station.  Residents of at least two wards in Ballygunge face an  acute crisis. Pictures by Kishor Roy ChowdhuryArun Das: Drinking water is a luxury for residents of wards 66 and 67 and their adjacent areas. We are told the crisis will end after the Kasba booster station is commissioned. When can we expect the unit to start functioning?																																																													I am aware of the drinking water problem in the area. Some Trinamul Congress workers even tried to bungle up the project, with the active participation of one of their leaders. However, to resolve the site problem, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation was given a plot called Utsab Math last October, on a request from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The civic body has not yet been able to start work on the booster station.

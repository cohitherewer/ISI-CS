The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 17, 2003 				 All for sports
																								Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play; it is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence. In other words, it is war minus the shooting... (George Orwell). But isnt that a very tilted view of sports and sportspeople? The first branch of International Research Centre for Sport in Asia will be inaugurated today. The centre, a first of its kind in India, aims to study the role of sport in contemporary society in all its facets. The centre will be flagged off by Professor Asis Banerjee, vice-chancellor, Calcutta University, Professor John Coyne, vice-chancellor, De Montfort University, and Professor J.A. Mangan, director, International Research Centre for Sport, Socialisation and Society, De Montfort University, Bedford, UK. Simultaneously, a sports book exhibition will be held at the departmental library where titles from foreign publishers will be sold at a discount and an exhibition of Indian cricket history, that is bound to be a hit with fans of the game. On September 18 (Thursday), a day-long seminar will be held at the same venue. The morning will start with Professor J.A. Mangan speaking on Imperial sport as the stylised epitome of a moral metaphor at 11 am followed by Kaushik Banerjees discussion on Sports history in India  problems and prospects at 12.30pm, and conclude with Boria Majumdars talk on Commercial revolution in Indian cricket at 2.30 pm.																								When: Today at 3 pm																								Where: Calcutta University, Alipore campus, Conference Room, Department of History

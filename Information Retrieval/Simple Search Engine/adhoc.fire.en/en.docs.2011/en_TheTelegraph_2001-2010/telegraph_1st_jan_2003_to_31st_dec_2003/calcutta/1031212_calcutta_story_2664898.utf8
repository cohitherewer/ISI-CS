The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, December 12, 2003  Fu Manchu amp; balderdash
 The Chinese are doing the vanishing  act but their temples, laundry lords and 10-course wedding  feasts are still very much there, says Soumitra Das Manju Dey and Kali Banerjee, who played Wong Lu, during  the shooting of Neel Akasher Nichey  Sax Rohmers  famous Dr Fu Manchu crime novels transformed them (the  Chinese) into a race of crafty devils like the Oriental  villain of the piece, highly intelligent but  of unregenerate  wickedness in the mid-seventies, when Bruce  Lee had just turned every young Indian male into a high-kicking  kung fu star making the appropriately incomprehensible noises  as he dealt imaginary deathly blows, a young Chinese tough  from Bow Barracks used to be the cock-of-the-walk of the  entire Bowbazar area. And for good reason too. Lithe of  body, he could single-handedly keep at bay an entire mob  of cut-throat-wielding and bomb-throwing rowdies, with sodawater  bottles as his only weapon. When these brawls erupted in  front of Orient cinema in Bentinck Street, silence would  suddenly descend on the busy thoroughfare and all shops  would down their shutters. Only the hapless paanwala  would watch helplessly as the scamp helped himself to the  bottles of soft drinks and broke them into smithereens. All this stopped once cinemas  and the entire scalping racket went bust. The Chinese tough,  subsequently, went away to Taiwan. I heard the other day  that recently when he came to spend a holiday on his former  turf, he had turned into an unrecognisable middle-aged man,  the very picture of respectability. In my long association with the  local Chinese community, this was the only instance I have  ever come upon of any character trait that could even remotely  be associated with the racist label of the Yellow Peril  so unfairly put on peoples known for their industriousness  and skill. When the Chinese began settling  down in London, Cardiff and Liverpool in the UK in the late  19th century, they faced a groundswell of hostility. Sax  Rohmers famous Dr Fu Manchu crime novels transformed them  into a race of crafty devils like the Oriental villain of  the piece, highly intelligent but of unregenerate wickedness. No doubt inspired by Rohmer, our  homegrown Conan Doyle, Niharranjan Gupta, introduced Chinese  villains in his shilling shockers whose adjectival excesses  and onomatopoeic ornamentation have entertained generations  of Bengalis. In his Raktamukhi Dragon (a Deb Sahitya  Kutir publication recommended in the Calcutta Gazette of  March 31, 1941, as a prize and for libraries by the education  directorate) detective Kiriti Roy is pitted against devil  incarnate Dr Wong, and ultimately defeats his plot to exterminate  the power-hungry West through biological warfare and establish  a utopia. But in Mrinal Sens first feature,  the warm human document entitled Neel Akasher Nichey,  made in 1957, actor Kali Banerjee turns into Wong Lu, a  peddler of brightly printed China silk, a deeply emotional  man who establishes an unlikely rapport with a Bengali woman  (Manju Dey) from the day she calls him bhai.  As he walks around in his three-quarter  length pyjamas, tunic with frogs, sola hat on head and wares  on shoulder, children pursue him screaming: Chineman changchung  malaika bhatt. Played sympathetically by Banerjee,  the quasi-fictional character never dwindles into John Chinaman  of caricatures. Based on a short story by poet Mahadevi  Varma, the film is set in the Thirties, when Calcutta was  rocked by the swadeshi movement. Mrinal Sen says when he used to  wonder about Chattawala Gali and Phears Lane, he never really  felt threatened. But he never wanted to depict the seamier  side of Sino life. Yet he had encountered people in a stupor.  And on Chinese New Years day, clashes would inevitably  break out during the dragon dance between the denizens of  old Chinatown who were from Formosa, and those from Tangra  who represented New China. The Indian Chinese Association  for Culture, Welfare and Development is surprisingly honest  on this score. After telling the story of how the first  Chinese set themselves up near Budge Budge at the time of  Warren Hastings, their 2001 diary tells how opium and  gambling used to be the two major vices of this community  that flourished till the late Fifties, and how gang wars  would break out here. Augustus Somerville, who lumped  all Orientals, including Indians, with the criminal classes,  has left behind an account of his visit to Chinatown round  about the Roaring Twenties in Crime and Religious Beliefs  in India. He describes a chow shop as one room divided  into three lit by a vile-looking oil lamp suspended from  the ceiling. He makes a fool of himself at roulette. In the opium den, the only furniture  is rags or mats for the addicts. In one corner, seated  on a low stool, with a tray full of pipes before him, a  small uncovered lamp and a little China pot, in which he  keeps the opium, sits the proprietor. As you enter, he heats  some of the opium, fills one of the pipes, lights a long  taper and then hands them both to you. Pennsylvania University has in  its collection an album compiled by an unknown GI who visited  Calcutta in 1947. It shows the addicts with skeletal limbs.  The caption reads: Actually the smokers do it legally.  Each den is licensed for so many pipes. Each pipe costs  a rupee, a phial of opium Rs 5. Average smoker consumes  a phial a day and there are about 186 pipes licensed in  Calcutta. Of course, when the Calcutta Improvement  Trust went on a building spree in the Sixties, Chinatown  was wiped out of the map and almost from memory. The temples  need to be repaired, but they are the only remnants of Chinepara.  The balcony of Sea Ip temple adjoining Poddar Court has  acquired a bilious green fibre glass roof but the ancient  weaponry and altar are still gorgeous. Carved wood painted  gold comes alive with the figures of human beings, pheasants,  crabs, and horseriders, each form seemingly endowed with  a life of its own. The idols wear marigold garlands, Hindu  style. Sea Voi Yune Leong Futh Church (the club has a Sun  Yatsen blow-up) and Gee Hing Church in Blackburn Lane look  equally opulent, dusty though they are. The former has a  suite of exquisitely carved chairs inlaid with marble. Although their numbers are dwindling  every year and the leather kings of Tangra are giving up  in despair, we still have a laundry lord in Shanghai of  Russell Street. And Chinese weddings with their 10-course  dinners are truly made in heaven.

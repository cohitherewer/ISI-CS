 Saturday, April 19, 2003 				 Cardiac clinic on wheels at your doorstep
 SUBHRO SAHA																								From the middle of next month, you wont have to step out for an ECG or an echocardiogram. Speciality cardiac care will come to the Calcuttans doorstep.																								In keeping with its mission of social welfare through heart, the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) is introducing a mobile cardiac clinic, which will travel to different paras of the city, providing routine diagnostics. The Cardiac Clinic on Wheels, an air-conditioned bus, will be equipped to perform tests like TMT, Echo and ECG, essential to diagnose any heart ailment.																								Cardiologists will accompany the unit to supervise the tests and offer consultation. Our long-cherished dream of taking heart care to the doorsteps at a highly affordable cost, has finally come true. We hope to serve the people of Calcutta and the districts of West Bengal, as well as remote corners in neighbouring states, says Alok Roy, vice-chairman, RTIICS.																								This will facilitate early diagnosis of heart ailments, which is vital to the success of an intervention, while doing away with the obvious inconvenience of coming down to a healthcare institution, feel doctors at the super-speciality heart hospital.																								The mobile clinic, donated by the Ashraya Hastha Trust, Bangalore, is fitted with all essential cardiac diagnostic equipment, like TMT, Echo and ECG, and is designed to do a complete cardiac check-up, generating reports then and there. A subsidised service will ensure that the facility can be accessed by all. Thus, while an ECG will cost Rs 25, a Treadmill Test will come for Rs 300.																								The mobile clinic will conduct check-up programmes five days a week, Monday through Friday. The check-ups will be held in association with para clubs or organisations involved in social welfare activities. The bus will visit one locality each day, conducting tests for people of that locality and giving reports on the spot.																								The check-up plan will include consultation with a cardiologist, cardiac diagnostic tests like TMT, Echo and ECG to assess the condition of the heart, besides fasting and post-prandial sugar counts. Follow-up treatment can be pursued at RTIICS, including further investigation and surgical or non-surgical intervention.																								We have identified more than 80 para clubs and associations to reach the benefits of the mobile clinic to remote corners of the city. Later, we plan to extend the facility to district towns and villages too, says Udayan Lahiry, chief administrator of the institute. 																								Check-ups will be conducted from 10 am to 1 pm and only cardiac patients can avail of the facility, strictly on a first-come-first-served basis. Registrations will be done prior to the date of the check-up by the local club or organisation associated with RTIICS in the project.

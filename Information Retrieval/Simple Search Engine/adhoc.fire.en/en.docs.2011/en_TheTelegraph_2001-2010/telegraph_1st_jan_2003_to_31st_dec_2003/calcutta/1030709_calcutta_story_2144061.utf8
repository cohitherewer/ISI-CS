																								Temptation of worldly pleasures and a self-centred life abound everywhere. These are within the easy reach of a man who is prepared to sacrifice his soul at the alter of material well-being. He surrenders to almost any little temptation and compromises a lot in order to keep himself happy. However, a human being, born with a conscience, does not find true satisfaction in this beastly life. He fights within himself and strives to come out of this self-created captivity. He fails, but keeps trying again and again till the last bit of his conscience is left in him. He changes his role from the hunted to the hunter and tries to kill the beast in him. If he succeeds, only then will life have a meaning to him. Nishad (The Huntsman) is one of Mohit Chattopadhyays earliest plays in which this never-say-die attitude of man finds expression in the plays protagonist, Dibakar. The play is all the more relevant in this age of consumerism and degradation of human values. This Samskar Bharati production is directed by Bikash Bhattacharya.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, August 18, 2003 				 Hotspots for holidays
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The road less travelled is in, as is Southeast Asia. Jammu and Kashmir is back with a bang among holidaymakers and Kerala is all booked. And with train tickets, or flights, bought, visitors at the four-day Travel and Tourism Fair on Calcuttas Maidan have been flocking in droves to find hotels and hotspots.																								The biggest trend this year has been on-the-spot bookings. Most people have already made their travel arrangements, and are now scouting for hotels and things to do, says Gazanfar Ibrahim, of Fairfest Media, organisers of the fair. In fact, most state tourism boards came to the fair with private companies as partners, from tour operators to hoteliers.																								On the last day, on Sunday, the fair was packed with Puja tourists, as the Calcutta traveller got ready to skip town and explore new shores this season.

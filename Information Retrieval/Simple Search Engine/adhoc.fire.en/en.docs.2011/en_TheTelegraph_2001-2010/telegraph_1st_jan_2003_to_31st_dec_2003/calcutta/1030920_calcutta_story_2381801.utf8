The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, September 20, 2003 				 Riot of colours
 quot;It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance, for our consideration and application of these things, and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process. quot;  Henry James																								In an effort to continue with its maiden foray of bringing exclusivity to the world of art and sculpture, Idiyas hosts its second collection, Continuity. This exhibition features the works of 30 talented artists along with veterans, including Suhas Roy and Prokash Karmakar, and contemporaries Bimal Kundu and Sanatan Dinda. The paintings include mesmerising works on Lord Ganesh, Goddess Durga and Lord Krishna that share wall space with canvases and drawings on a variety of diverse themes in a riot of colours. Stylised experimental sculptures in various mediums like bronze-marble and metal are eye-catchers indeed. Lamps and tables created in fibreglass complement the Idiyas world of imagination and design. 																								When: Till September 30; 10.30 am - 7.30 pm																								Where: Idiyas Gallery, 15, Dover Road

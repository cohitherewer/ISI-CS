 Monday, May 12, 2003 				 Mill workers stab each other, panic shuts shops
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two jute mill workers, allegedly under the influence of drugs, stabbed each other on Sunday morning at Sarangabad, in Budge Budge, on the southern fringes of the city. As a fallout of the clash, all the shops and the market were closed spontaneously.																								Additional superintendent of police R.K. Singh claimed both men were drug addicts and not on the best of terms after a feud in the past. We will interrogate them when they regain consciousness. They have been admitted to the Sarangabad ESI Hospital in a critical state, he added. 																								The two jute workers were sitting in a tea-stall around 7 am, when they began to quarrel. Other people tried to intervene and break up the fight in vain. 																								Both of them whipped out knives from their pockets and attacked each other. Those present panicked and began to disperse. Many bystanders mistook it for violence related to the panchayat elections. Sarangabad adjoins the panchayat area, and election booths were set up close by.																								The duo ran out of the tea-stall and started chasing each other, knives in hand. Colleagues tried to restrain them but could not get close enough, fearing they would get slashed. 																								After a few minutes, one of them stuck a knife into the other mans stomach. The injured man slumped on the ground, bleeding profusely. Soon, however, he managed to get back on his feet. He struck the head of his adversary with a knife. Then both fell on the ground, unconscious. Shop-keepers panicked and downed their shutters. The local market, too, was closed.

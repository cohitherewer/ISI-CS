Picture by Aranya  Sen Mahasaptami at the residential  complexes taking part in this years The Telegraph  ING Vysya Hand-in-Hand community puja programme, in association  with Sony Entertainment Television, was houseful with  a string of events. All 30 housing committees held a series  of contests to encourage the para puja concept. Antakshari was the top draw at  most locations, day or night, including Golf Green Phase  I, Swaranika in Shakuntala Park, Prasad Nagar on BT Road  and Anushakti Abasan in Bidhannagar. Team spirit worked  wonders alongside some friendly competition as the participants  belted out golden oldies and catchy tunes and the audience  cheered them on. Bank Garden in Bansdroni, Malancha  in Baranagar, Vinayak on KC Ghosh Road, Karunamoyee G Block,  Purbachal Sarbojanin and Anupama on VIP Road started the  days activities with an Antakshari session  some in the  morning and others in the evening  and wrapped up with  a quiz contest. Peerless Nagar in Panihati, on the other  hand, began with the quiz and finished with Antakshari. Regent Estate, which had kicked  off its puja revelry on Wednesday with a conch-blowing contest  and Antakshari, held a sit-and-draw for kids and a quiz  for all on Thursday.  Golf Garden Natun Pally, too,  held a spot quiz, as well as Sera Uttor for women at 9.30  pm. Green View on Southern Avenue had simultaneously organised  conch-blowing and Sera Uttor during the day. ODRC Rental in Behala and Golf  Green Phase III, IV and VII both began with sit-and-draw  contests. The former continued with Antakshari and quiz,  while the latter witnessed a dhunuchi naach. Sikhar  Bindu in Brahmapur started early with a sit-and-draw at  8.30 am. The rest of the day passed off with a plethora  of events, from quiz in the afternoon to conch-blowing,  diya-lighting and Antakshari at night. At the other end of town, residents  of Anandam in Dum Dum participated in a sit-and-draw, Sera  Uttor and Antakshari with great gusto. And at CIT Singhibagan  in Madan Chatterjee Lane, a Sera Uttor competition was followed  by diya-lighting. A spot quiz at 6 pm came after  conch-blowing at noon at Motijhil Housing in Dum Dum. In Salt Lake, Karunamoyee A, B,  C and D had organised conch-blowing and diya-lighting,  while Labony held a sit-and-draw for kids at 9 in the morning  where the youngsters trooped in to test their talents. Antakshari  was held in the evening and quiz at night. On VIP Road, a sit-and-draw contest  was held in Minakshi, while a spot quiz drew the crowds  at Dakshinayan. At Gitanjali, residents gathered at the  puja pandal for sit-and-draw, spot quiz and Sera Uttor. The action at BP Township in Baishnabghata  was after dark, with a conch-blowing contest, diya-lighting  and Antakshari. Happy Nook in Patuli started with sit-and-draw  and ended with Sera Uttor, while conch-blowing was squeezed  in between.  Purbayan on Purbachal Main Road  had conch-blowing and quiz. Udayan in Survey Park held conch-blowing,  diya-lighting and the family and personality of the  Puja awards. The prizes  from chocolate bars  to ketchup bottles  were sponsored by Nestle, apart from  other gift vouchers. In high spirits Its the spirit, not the size,  that matters. The slogan is slowly seeping into puja organisers  across the city, from Bagbazar to Behala. Recognising the  need to raise awareness for sensitive pujas, a new concept   CESC The Telegraph True Spirit Puja supported by  People United for Better Living in Calcutta (PUBLIC)  was  launched this year.  Organised in association with  the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (PCB) and the Calcutta  Municipal Corporation (CMC), the endeavour aims at turning  the spotlight on puja committees which dont strive for  prizes but care for people and their preferences.  From traffic management and compliance  with civic norms to fire-fighting preparedness and facilities  for pandal-hoppers  the performance is being judged on  10 different parameters.  A panel of judges, comprising  members of The Telegraph, CESC, CMC and PUBLIC, visited  79 pandals  short-listed for the initiative  on Sashthi  and Saptami to check out the sparks of spirit.  The results, based on the overall  scores of the committees, will be announced on Ashtami evening.  For one of the teams doing the  rounds in north Calcutta on the second day, the experience  was worth remembering. Its a perfect example of the saying  that small is beautiful, said one of the team members about  Agragami Sangha in Sinthee. Besides making provisions for  fire extinguishers, puja organisers on the citys northern  fringes have minimised risk factors by sprinkling caustic  soda on the pandal materials.  Streets here werent blocked and  volunteers were managing the traffic. With separate entrances  for the physically challenged and doctors round-the-clock,  the organisers have shown enough signs of prudence.  Its nice to know that puja organisers  dont just bank on glitter and gimmicks, said another member  on the social initiatives taken by organisers like Bagbazar  Sarbojanin and CIT Road Abasikbrinda.  Complying with the CESC and PCB  norms, limiting use of plastics and taking up various sorts  of social initiatives  awareness is catching up fast in  the city, the team member stressed. The panel of judges came across  sincere efforts to retain the spirit of the Pujas at several  other locations, including Ahiritola Sarbojanin, Suruchi  Sangha, Nandana Yuba Sangha, Chaltabagan Lohapatti and Nabamilan. The ones that score high on camaraderie,  care and compliance will move on to the second round and  a set of celebrity judges will pick the winners on Thursday.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Teenage pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases are on the rise; cases of ovarian cysts and even infertility are increasing due to stress and obesity; breast cancer has overtaken uterine cancer by leaps and bounds, with one in every 30 women in a city at risk. 																								These were some health concerns thrown up by leading city gynaecologists Pranab Dashgupta, Sarbani Ghosh and Sashi Jindal at AMRI Apollo Clinic, on Southern Avenue, on Tuesday.																								Womens health, from birth to post-menopause, was the talking point in an awareness exercise to educate the fairer sex on some basic dos and donts that need to be followed, and to erase popular misconceptions. 																								For instance, vaginal bleeding of a newborn for a period of seven days is normal, but after menopause, it is often indication of a more serious problem, the panel observed. While diarrhoea during menstruation is a common physiological symptom, severe stomach cramps is not.																								The most important thing is, what in the West is referred to as a well woman check-up. It is necessary because cancers like breast, uterine and ovarian, are detectable in the early stages, through tests like the pap smear, and can be treated, explains Dashgupta. So, a pap smear should be done every two years after 35 and a regular mammography after 40. But a husbands support is essential, which is sadly lacking in Indian men.																								While Ghosh believes anaemia, present in around 70 per cent of our women is a growing cause for concern, since it can lead to other problems, Jindal observes that ignorance about common issues, like hysterectomy, is a drawback, since women often dont realise that they can lead normal lives afterwards.

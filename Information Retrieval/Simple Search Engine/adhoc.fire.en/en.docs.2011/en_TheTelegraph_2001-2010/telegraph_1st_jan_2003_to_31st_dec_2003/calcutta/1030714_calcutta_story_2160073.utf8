 Monday, July 14, 2003 				 Funds for stalled heart centre
 A STAFF REPORTER																								After years of procrastination, the government has decided to release Rs 1.14 crore to complete Calcuttas first hi-tech institute of cardiovascular sciences in the century-old Albert Victor building, on the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital campus.																								On Friday, Metro had published a report on how the multi-crore project had reached a dead end when the government refused to release more funds, after already spending Rs 17 lakh on the project.																								The day the report was published, state health secretary Asim Barman summoned Abhijit Banerjee, head of department (cardiology) of R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, who had conceived the project, to Writers Buildings to inform him about the governments decision to release Rs 1.14 crore for the project.																								Health secretary Barman said on Sunday the state health department would not only fund the project but had also decided to help buy medical equipment for the hospital. 																								This centre will help us deal with cardiac patients from the lower-income-group levels and the facilities will be on a par with the best heart centres of the city. It will be a centre of excellence, Barman asserted.																								According to the project plan approved by the government, the institute for cardiovascular sciences will only initially be housed in the Albert Victor building. Later, it will extend to the adjacent Nilratan Sirkar building, which already houses the out-patients department and an intensive coronary care unit.

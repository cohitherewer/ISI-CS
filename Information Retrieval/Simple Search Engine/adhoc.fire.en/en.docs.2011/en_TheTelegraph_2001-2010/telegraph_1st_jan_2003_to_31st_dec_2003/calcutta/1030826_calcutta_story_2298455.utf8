The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, August 26, 2003 				 Recent Works
																								This exhibition contains a multiplicity of expressions and meanings. Through its entire development, Indian art (more specifically Bengal Art) has shown a sensitivity and a reverence for nature and natural materials. These traditions are still held in high esteem as is seen by the deep respect given to native artistic traditions. Despite various art movements leading to constant changes, experimentation and creativity there has always been a conscious effort to pay obeisance to traditions . Recent Works is about continuity and contradiction  unbreakable traditions and new progressions, ineffable delicacy and fearsome subjects, picturesque and at the same time complex and visually simple. The exhibition attempts to show the cross over and merging. This results in art which is diverse yet not alienating, often enigmatic and extraordinarily skilful. This refreshing show features the works of Swapan Bhandary, Maya Burman, Arunima Choudhury, Mustak Khan Chowdhury, Sukumar Dutta, Sohini Dhar, Seema Ghurayya, Uday Kumar Mondal, Ketakee Roy Chowdhury, and Dilip Kumar Samanta.																								When: Till August 30; 2 pm - 8 pm																								Where: CIMA Gallery, Sunny Towers (2nd Floor), 43, Ashutosh Chowdhury Avenue

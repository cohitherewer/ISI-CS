 																											- Delhi discretion prod sets off free-colleges rethink at varsity MITA MUKHERJEE																								After receiving the go-ahead from the government, by way of a statement made in the state Assembly about a fortnight ago, Calcutta University (CU) appears to have set in motion a process that could lead to autonomy for the citys blue-chip colleges, like Presidency and St Xaviers.																								We dont want the colleges to break away haphazardly, CU pro vice-chancellor (academic) Suranjan Das said on Sunday. Once we are ready with the modalities, we can grant autonomy in an organised manner, he added. Both the government and CU, having opposed the idea of granting autonomy to colleges all these days because they perceived it as a shrinkage of their turf, are currently coming round to it after the University Grants Commission (UGC) issued an ultimatum.																								Early this month, state higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty indicated in the Assembly that the government was not averse to granting autonomy to select colleges. The only potential impediment was the aversion of teachers and non-teaching employees because, by the UGC guidelines, their representatives (as also those elected by students) would have no place in the governing bodies of autonomous colleges.																								Simultaneously, the authorities took cognisance of a veiled UGC threat to grant autonomy to willing colleges without consulting the parent varsity if the latter sat on cases for more than six weeks. The circular says the universitys (or the state governments) silence will be considered a mute approval if they do not react to the appeal for autonomy from a college within that period, and the UGC will then be free to use its own discretion, vis--vis that appeal.																								More than the ministers cue, the CU brass appeared to have in mind the six-week-deadline circular from the UGC, as it decided on Wednesday to keep the autonomy issue as one of those to be discussed in the CU syndicate meeting later this month.																								 The CU decision could produce a ripple-effect on the other universities, as it is the largest in the state, having around 200 affiliated colleges, say officials. There are nearly 350 of them all over Bengal. 																								Like the Left Front government, the CU, too, had looked askance at demands for autonomy for colleges like Presidency and St Xaviers and central prods prompting those. It has, over the past few years, rejected pleas from Presidency, asking for autonomous status. 																								This, in turn, prompted critics to say that the university was loath to let go of colleges like Presidency as then, it would not have anything to boast of. 																								Das, however, would comment only on the present. We are progressing on the autonomy issue with a positive frame of mind, he asserted.

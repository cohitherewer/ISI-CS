The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Saturday, December 13, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with... Christopher Plummer.  You are mostly at ease with yourself, but tend to become  over-emotional and impractical. You enjoy talking and are  seldom at a loss for words. You have the determination to  persevere, even in the face of severe odds. You fear monotony  and need a touch of drama to keep you going.  Kusum Bhandari

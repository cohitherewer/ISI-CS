The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Saturday, January 18, 2003 					 					 You share your birthday with...Kevin Costner. You are self-reliant and never lose sight of your goal. Frequent foreign trips ahead. You stand out for your energy and courage. Go for pearls and rubies. Red and yellow are your colours. You are a family person.  Kusum Bhandari

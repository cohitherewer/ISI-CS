				 																The Book 
	(Aniruddha Bahal) A funky and fast-paced novel about corruption  in Indian life, but with a twist. The anti-hero is a tough  reporter and ex-army cadet, who gets involved in an arms  scandal. The contemporary, cynical novel comes from first-hand  experience of the man of Tehelka fame.  The Film				 																																	(Directed  by Chris Columbus) The hero of the wizarding world is back  with a bang, flying in cars and on broomsticks, fighting giant  spiders, talking to snakes and, of course, saving the people  from the evil Lord Voldemort. Better, than the first film  in the series, the familiar faces return in action, along  with a few new ones, not to forget the lovable Dobby. Pick  up the VCD from MusicWorld  The Play				 																																	(GD  Birla Sabhagar, July 20, 6.30 pm) The play, written by Kashinath  Singh, exposes the reality behind the socio-economic changes  sweeping the ancient town of Varanasi or Kashi. Dramatised,  designed and directed by Usha Ganguli (picture above), this  Rangakarmee production is presented by Sanskriti Sagar.  The Album				 																																	(Music:  Rajesh Roshan) Rajesh Roshan is known to reserve his best  for brother Rakeshs films. Check out the title track, with  Udit Narayan on a romantic high, as also Jaadoo Jaadoo,  which has a double take with Adnan Sami featuring in one.

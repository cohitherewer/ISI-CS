  In quieter times: The RCGC golf course Apropos the report ICSE script recheck on merit alone (Metro, May 1), it is quite interesting to note that in the wake of the cases dragging the Madhyamik Board into legal hazards, the ICSE authorities have advised the schools affiliated to the Council to be selective in rechecking of scripts. This is apparently to ensure that the number of such applications is kept to the minimum. This directive of the ICSE authorities is not based on equity and justice.  Examinees have grievances galore and the authorities are surely apprehensive about this. That is why they are toying with the idea of curtailing the rights of students. The contention of the ICSE secretary of high perfection in the ICSE scripts as he cannot put his signature to an incorrect document is too much to take.  As a large number of scripts have to be checked in the shortest possible time, the results are unlikely to be foolproof. The approach of the ICSE to this critical issue may raise doubts in the minds of students whether the officials are trying to evade accepting mistakes to improve the image of the Council. In this context, it may be added that most other universities and Boards allow not only rechecking but also a review of the answer-scripts. Let us hope that good sense prevails and there is a rethink on the present directive.  Piyal Mukherjee,  Lake Town.  The Metro report Blood on the greens deals body blow to golf club (April 30) highlights how militant trade unionism has vitiated the atmosphere of the state although the ruling party mandarins assure the CII and the chambers of commerce at every meet of their sincere co-operation to revive a healthy industrial climate here. Will the chief minister give a second thought to this vital issue?  Govinda Bakshi,  Budge Budge.  Apropos the report Royal shutdown  after roster ruckus (Metro, May 1), it is really distressing  to note that Royal Calcutta Golf Club had to close down  due to hooliganism by a section of the staff. Militant trade  unionism has played havoc with the industrial climate of  the state. The manhandling of a senior club executive may  send a danger signal to entrepreneurs who are contemplating  to set up industrial units here at a time when the government  is striving hard for industrial rejuvenation.  Ranu Mukherjee,  Burrabazar.  The series of fires taking place in the city is cause for concern (Hopeless day endless night, Metro, April 24). Has the fire department become so ineffective? What adds to its woes is the dearth of water sources.  Kazi Kamruddin Ahmed,  Lalbazar Street.  Why is it that every time a fire occurs questions  arise about the need for sophisticated equipment? Is it  not the duty of the fire services department to see that  these are purchased immediately so that valuable life and  goods can be saved in future?  Pawan Khanna,  Address not given.  This is with reference to your article Feluda back on big screen via Bombay (Metro, April 24). Who can deny the fact that Feluda has always put the screen on fire, whenever he has shown up on big screen. Hope Bombaiyer Bombete succeeds in creating the same magic and impact.  Kunal Ray,  Howrah  Waldorf has been a gourmet landmark on Park Street since 1947 (Restaurant case, City Diary, Metro, April 30). What is to be the fate of this favourite eatery menaced by the dread shadow of jerry-built and gimcrack highrises? Rally round all ye citizens of the only city with a heart and show that we cater to need and not greed.  Colleen Hupping,  Acre Road. Apropos the report Bills bypass bypass packages (Metro, May 26), Rabindranath Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has been cited as charging Rs 1.75 lakh for a bypass surgery. In actuality, open-heart surgery rates at our hospital vary from Rs 1.05 lakh for a general ward, Rs 1.15 lakh for a semi-private room to Rs 1.5 lakh for a private room, all inclusive.  R. Udayan Lahiry,  Administrator, RTIICS.

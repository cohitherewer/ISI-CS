 Wednesday, April 02, 2003 				 Museum staff trained to serve with a smile
 TAMAL SENGUPTA 																								Motivated by Governor Viren J. Shah, the Indian Museum authorities have embarked on educating the staff to greet visitors with a smile. Altogether 52 employees of the total strength of 240, including those manning the ticket counters, guides and security persons in the galleries and book shops, went through a two-day orientation course over the weekend. 																								Museums all over the country are becoming more visitor-friendly. We now consider our visitors as clients and try to give them our best. For this, we have conducted an orientation course for those who interact with the public directly, said museum director Shyamal Kanti Chakraborty. The employee at the ticket counter will now welcome visitors with a smile while selling tickets.																								It is learnt that Governor Shah, who is also chairman of the museums trustee board, has taken a special interest in the training being imparted to the staff interacting with visitors. 																								Shah had himself conducted orientation programmes for employees of Raj Bhavan, Indian Museum, Victoria Memorial and the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre last April. He had then asked both the Indian Museum and Victoria Memorial authorities to conduct more such courses to increase the efficiency of the staff. 																								But the Indian Museum authorities failed to organise an orientation course soon after, as Chakraborty had his hands full, looking after the affairs of National Library as well. Chakraborty has only recently been relieved of his additional responsibility, after the Centre appointed Ramanuj Bhattacharjee officer on special duty at the National Library. 																								Over the past few months, the department of culture at the Centre had also been insisting on an improvement of services at all the leading museums in the country. 																								A meeting of the authorities of all principal museums across the country was held on March 13 in Delhi. It was then decided that the authorities would initiate efforts to make the museums more attractive to people and for that, the employees would be given special training. 																								Chakraborty said they were planning to train senior officials of the museum, too, and another orientation programme was in the offing for the museum officers. Senior officials and the top rung, like the deputy director and myself, will undergo training as well, he added.																								Several people throng the museum every day. Apart from being a spot of entertainment and leisure, the museum also holds immense academic importance. For instance, it is a vital source of research for scholars. Hence, we are working hard to improve our service. Guides who lead visitors to the galleries are also being trained, said Chakraborty.

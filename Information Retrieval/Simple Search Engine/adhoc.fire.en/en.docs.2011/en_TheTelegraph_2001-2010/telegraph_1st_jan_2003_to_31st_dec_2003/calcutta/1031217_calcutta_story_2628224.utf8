 Wednesday, December 17, 2003 				 Aid centre blinded by adversity
 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA																								Alecia Tundawalla, in her mid-20s, has cleared the National Eligibility Test and the State-Level Eligibility Test this year, and is preparing for her doctoral dissertation in political science from Calcutta University. Biman Ganguly has completed his post-graduation in English from Jadavpur University and, after clearing the School Service Commission examination, teaches in a Park Circus school. Both are visually impaired.																								Like them, a few hundred young blind men and women are quietly reaching milestones at different levels, after studying with specially-designed learning materials at the centre for the visually handicapped, in the state central library in Ultadanga. However, officials feel the days ahead may not see as many success stories, because the centres ability to help is diminishing.																								The reason: dwindling infrastructure and manpower to prepare notes for Braille books, audio cassettes and compact discs required by these students.																								Inspired by the success of these students, many others are using the resources of the centre. But since we do not have adequate manpower, we are unable to produce the required number of cassettes. Nowadays, even visually-impaired students from far-flung areas like Basirhat and Nadia come to the centre, says Chandralekha Sinha, librarian of the unit, the only one of its kind in the city, run by NGO Society for Visually Handicapped.																								Library officials also rue the lack of modern equipment. We do not have a multiple audio cassette-copier machine. So, our volunteers can only make a single audio cassette at a time. But, as many students need the cassette at any given moment, we are unable to provide for all of them, an official of the unit says.																								Set up about five years ago, the centre also lacks gadgets like compact disc writers and other aids for the visually-handicapped, like answering machines and adequate equipment to make books in Braille.																								In most cases, students do not get the books written in Braille. So, we have to make an audio version of the books. But, as the number of volunteers is decreasing, we are wondering how to cope, says Henna Basu, secretary of the organisation that runs the library.

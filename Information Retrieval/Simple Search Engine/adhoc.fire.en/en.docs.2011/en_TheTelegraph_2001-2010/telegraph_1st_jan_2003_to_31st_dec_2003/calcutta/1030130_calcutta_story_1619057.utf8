 Thursday, January 30, 2003  Grade grumble in teacher test
 Uniform ratings spark resentment for  varsity refresher course SUNANDO SARKAR A straight A for attendance  for everyone in one examination; for another batch, its  a B, no questions asked. An ambitious programme, devised  by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to update the  knowledge of college and university teachers through regular  orientation and refresher courses, seems to be coming unstuck  at Calcutta University, with teachers saying the programme  has degenerated into a sham. Take, for example, a refresher  course for Hindi teachers held in the city recently. Every  single teacher scored a B. Just after that session, the  university conducted an orientation course for some teachers  from various subjects. Each one present was awarded an A,  raising more questions than answering them. Every colleague I knew who attended  every lecture throughout the three-week course got an A,  said a teacher of Bengali in a south Calcutta college. I  am not complaining, but this response of the university  to a matter that the UGC is pursuing in all seriousness  is symptomatic of a larger malaise, she added. Besides the straight As and  Bs for everyone attending the programmes and answering  the questions, the university has not yet been able to start  the micro-teaching component of the orientation courses.  Micro-teaching, say officials, gives a teacher the opportunity  to assess where he/she is going wrong in class. But CU, at least, has been faster  off the blocks than its more-celebrated city counterpart,  Jadavpur University, say officials. We started the UGC-prescribed  courses in April 2002, as soon as we received the directive,  a senior CU official claimed. He, however, admitted that  there was a tendency to trivialise the programme which,  he explained, was not unnatural, given the number of teachers  CU has to train every year. According to UGC directives, a  teacher must complete a refresher course and an orientation  course to be eligible for the next round of promotion. For  instance, a lecturer has to complete at least one of the  two to be eligible for the post of a senior lecturer; similarly,  a senior lecturer must sit through both to be eligible for  the post of a reader. The orientation course, say officials,  aims at updating a teachers knowledge of subjects other  than her own. A history teacher may have to sit through  a class on nuclear physics and a microbiology teacher may  have to attend a lecture on Shakespeare, which, according  to a section of teachers and officials, is not much use.

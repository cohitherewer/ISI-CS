																								P hotography is truth  Jean Luc Godard. 																								Lensmen capture the essence of truth and beauty inherent in nature  all manifestations of our Creators great love for us. They are artists who help us view Gods creation from a new angle and often re-create unique images from ordinary objects lying around us. The Seagull Foundation for the Arts, in association with the British Deputy High Commission, is currently hosting an exhibition of photographs by Alan Hayward. Orderliness in all objects generates repeated patterns at different scales. Spirals and repeat patterns occur richly in nature, inspiring artists globally. Hayward, too, has been mesmerised by this fundamental orderliness underlying the apparent chaos of natural phenomena. I have photographed natural patterns for several years and this exhibition of my works brings together images from different continents.... I think of my pictures as visual haiku (the Japanese poem format), examining the essence of the subject; combining apparent simplicity with a contemplative awareness of nature. 																								When: Till December 24; 2 pm - 7.30 pm																								Where: Seagull Arts amp; Media Resource Centre, 36C, S.P. Mukherjee Road

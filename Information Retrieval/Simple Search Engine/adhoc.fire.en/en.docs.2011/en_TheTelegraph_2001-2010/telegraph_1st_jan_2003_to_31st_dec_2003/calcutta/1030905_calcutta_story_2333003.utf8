	The bandh culture of our state is taking a toll on the  education system. As most professional courses are designed  on a specific timeframe, students are forced to skip valuable  classes during a bandh. By the end of the academic year,  students are at a loss, not knowing how to make up. The  striking parties do not even bother to give this issue a  thought. In such a situation, only the institutions can  bail them out by holding additional classes.

	The only vehicular routes between Dum Dum Park and Bangur  Avenue are Jessore Road and VIP Road. People will benefit  if a footbridge is const-ructed over Bagjola canal.

	The Shahid Minar bus stand is slushy and marked with large  potholes, posing a risk for passengers. The authorities  must renovate it.  
	Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum Park.

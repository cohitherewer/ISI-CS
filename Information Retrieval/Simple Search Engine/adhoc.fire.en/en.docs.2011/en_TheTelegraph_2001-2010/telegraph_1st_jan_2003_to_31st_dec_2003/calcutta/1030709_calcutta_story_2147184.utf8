The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, July 09, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Join forces to keep cash safe
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should security at a bank be the polices or the banks responsibility? Busy banking: Unarmed custodians of cash Barsha Chabaria,
																		Rabindra Nagar.																																																														Both the police and the bank officials serve the nation and their duty includes safeguarding peoples assets. They should join hands and shoulder the responsibility together. 									

Michelle Mendes,
																		Marquis Lane.																																																														Security at a bank should primarily be the banks responsibility and not the polices. The banks should employ security personnel and also instal modern devices. Of course, there should be an emergency phone number to contact the local police station in case of a sudden intrusion, and the police should be quick to act. But the initial effort should be made by the bank.									

Joydeep Chatterjee,
																		Shyambazar.																																																														The security of a bank is its own responsibility. God helps those who help themselves.									

Sounak Chakraborty,
																		Barui Para Lane.																																																														Bank robbers these days are armed with sophisticated weapons. Neither the bank authorities nor the police can evade responsibility. Bank authorities should depute guards from private security agencies or seek help from the police to protect their property. The police can never refuse help to the bank authorities.									

Sourish Mohan Mitra,
																		Baishnabghata Road.																																																														It is the duty of the police force to maintain law and order. They are primarily responsible for protecting peoples life and property. Hence, security of banks is also their responsibility. However, there are thousands of banks in the country. I do not think it will be possible for the police to protect each and every bank. But the intelligence department should keep a tab on criminals.									

P.N. Pal,
																		Karaya Road.																																																														The primary responsibility of a banks security rests with the state police. Maintenance of law and order is on the concurrent list of the Constitution. In case of inadequacy of the state police, the Centre should be approached to provide the necessary force. The Reserve Bank of India has laid down the criteria for defining the high-risk and low-risk areas for banks. It is only for the high-risk areas that the banks should have the responsibility of posting security guards. 									

Govind Das Dujari,
																		Behala.																																																														It is certainly the responsibility of the police. Most banks have a small number of security guards but are still being looted at regular intervals. Earlier, the polices intelligence network worked as a strong deterrent for criminals. What happened to that? Considering the present state of the police department, the banks should instal direct links with the local thanas with state-of-the-art gadgets and also instal video cameras at strategic points inside and outside banks. Even if the police force fails to arrive in time, the cameras would provide vital clues. 									

Sumant Poddar,
																		Kyd Street.																																																														Security at a bank should be the responsibility of the bank itself. This is because with crime increasing daily, there is a definite shortage of manpower in the police force. The banks should not depend on the security provided by the police. Instead, they should employ professional security agencies, who are more dependable and better-equipped. However, there should be regular interaction with the local police station.									

Arindam Chakraborty,
																		Dunlop.																																																														It is the banks responsibility. It can never be expected that the police will ensure full protection of the banks as they are already entrusted with the huge task of providing security to the life and property of the citizens. Obviously, the responsibility lies with the bank and they should take every possible safety measure to ensure maximum security. They can take help from the police but they cannot fully rely on them.									

Gautam Mookerjee,
																		EM Bypass.																																																														With growing unemployment leading to increasing frustration among youth, no security under anybodys responsibility will help in the days to come. The situation has become frightening and our society, particularly in West Bengal, is heading towards disaster. Unless the job scenario improves, we are doomed. 									

Alka V. Tirkey,
																		Golpark.																																																														Both should work together to safeguard peoples hard-earned money. 									

Sananda Sen,
																		New Alipore.																																																														A bank is in the best position to decide how tight its security should be, especially on days when cash transfers take place to the head office. But it has been seen in most cases that they depend on the police. Why should the police be involved? The duty of the police is public welfare. Only if a bank finds it impossible to arrange for its security should it appeal to the police.									

Mohd. Tanweer,
																		G.V.R. Lane.																																																														It is the banks responsibility. Incidents of crime take place even near police stations. Policemen are not detergent soaps to clean social evils. So, it is better to appoint private guards rather than depend on policemen who lack the training to resist dacoits.									

Dinesh Mohunta,
																		Barat Colony.																																																														On the face of the situation, it is the banks responsibility. Looking at the increasing Severe Acute Dacoity Syndrome plaguing the city, the banks should enhance their security systems to avoid having to bank on the police. Police picketing at banks will cause panic among customers and put the staff ill at ease. 									

Govinda Bakshi,
																		Budge Budge.																																																														Banks are concerned with transactions of huge amounts of money everyday. Naturally, they should have strong security arrangements of their own to safeguard public money and wealth. Nominal security arrangements cannot stop sporadic dacoities. On the other hand, regular police vigil in different areas will lend security to the public as also to financial institutions. Thus, Bank and Police should work in tandem.									

Santosh Chakravarty,
																		Unique Park.																																																														Security at a bank is primarily the responsibility of the bank. Deployment of armed guards, installation of alarm bells and other sundry precautionary measures are all to be adopted by the bank. The responsibility for security arrangements squarely lies on the bank itself.									

Satyen biswas,
																		Behala.																																																														The bank should recruit ex-military personnel to guard the premises from dacoits. The guards should be authorised to use firearms in case of emergency.

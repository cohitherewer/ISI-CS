 A STAFF REPORTER																								A man was murdered and two robberies were committed in the North 24-Parganas over the past 24 hours. In all three cases, the culprits are at large.																								Four armed robbers stormed a petrol pump in the Belghoria police station area, robbing it of Rs 60,000 late on Friday. The four miscreants walked up to the petrol pump office, pointed a gun at the cashier, and demanded that he hand over the money. We have received leads from witnesses, said an officer of the police station.																								In a separate incident, 10 armed men ransacked the block development officers (BDO) office and the panchayat office of Bashirhat, making off with a total of Rs 74,000.																								Early on Saturday morning, the gang launched a surprise attack on the guards of the BDO office and managed to overpower them. Locking them up in a room, the robbers ransacked the office and left with Rs 60,000, said an officer.																								The gang then went to a nearby building that houses the panchayat office. They looted Rs 14,000, forcing open several cupboards in the building. We suspect that they may have also stolen important documents. The security guards on duty may have been involved and we have detained four of the five of them, the officer added.																								In the third case, Hirua Mahato, who was released from jail a month ago, was killed on Friday night. Mahatos body was found near the railway tracks in Titagarh, on the citys eastern fringes. He was shot at point blank range. We suspect criminals of a rival group, said an officer.																								nRoad accident: Five persons were injured on Saturday at Kona Expressway in the Jagachha police station area when a private bus on the Digha-Howrah route collided with a Banksara-bound car.

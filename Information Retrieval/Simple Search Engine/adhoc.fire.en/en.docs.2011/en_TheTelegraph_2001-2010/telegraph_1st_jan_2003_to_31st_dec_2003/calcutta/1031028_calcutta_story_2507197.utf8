 Tuesday, October 28, 2003 				 Bar Council in Black Day call
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								Members of the state Bar Council will observe a Black Day on Tuesday to protest the alleged attack on the judiciary by Left Front chairman Biman Bose, in the wake of Justice Amitava Lalas order restricting weekday working-hour rallies in the city.																								Saradindu Biswas, former chairman and executive committee member of the West Bengal Bar Council, said on Monday that Calcutta High Court will reopen on Tuesday after a 27-day Puja vacation. 																								We could not observe the Black Day earlier because the courts were closed. So, we have decided to observe it on the very first day after the courts reopen on Tuesday, he added.

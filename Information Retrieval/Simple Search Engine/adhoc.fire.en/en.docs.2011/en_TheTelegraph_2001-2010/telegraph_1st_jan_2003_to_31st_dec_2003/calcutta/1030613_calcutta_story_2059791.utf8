The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, June 13, 2003  Signposts of the present
 History jostles with history in the  making on the Shakespeare Sarani-Park Street end of a bustling  Camac Street, reports Soumitra Das Once you have stepped inside the  building with the smart, snow-white faade and are climbing  the wooden staircase, there is no way you could tell this  is actually part of a decrepit old house that faces Middleton  Row. As you walk up the two flights of stairs, you confront  yourself in the wall-to-wall mirrors on each landing. This  is 2 Camac Street, with a giant vinyl signboard glowing  across its face that conceals the walls that have shed their  plaster. A smaller vinyl signboard on the portal, too, announces  the name of the same software training institute whose office  occupies the refurbished mews of No. 2. No. 2 is a large house surrounded  by a mews. As a face-saving exercise, as it were, only the  section of the mews adjacent to Loreto House are kept in  good repair. Is the rent higher here? The software training  institute looks bright and modern in red, white and black.  A wall of dimpled glass at least six inches thick separates  the office. Another entrance to the building  also on Middleton Row looks even more spiffy  everything  in unblemished white, staircase included. But the third  entrance to the mews facing Camac Street is filthy. The  staircase is of marble but the roof looks like it may fall  anytime on anybodys head. The banyan tree on the pavement  with a tangle of aerial roots hanging from it increases  the sense of decrepitude. In fact, what looks like the single-storeyed  outhouse at one end of the courtyard, is plastered with  the Corporations notices screaming: Beware. Building is  unsafe. The courtyard is a dump, where mountains of debris  and giant rusting joists have piled up around the mango  trees. The main building beyond the mews  is handsome but shabby. I was lucky to run into Akshyay  Chand Jain, 78, who has occupied the top floor for the past  30 years or even more. His son Lalit is an interior decorator,  and he caresses with pride the carved wood banisters, which  he claims are of Swedish origin. Although the sprawling synthetic  velvet sofas and modular furniture do not really match the  loftiness of this apartment, thanks to the Jains, they have  done nothing to desecrate the spirit of the building, where,  I soon find out from the old man himself, that Arathoon  Stephen, one of the founding fathers of the Grand Hotel,  lived and died. Akshaybabus grandchildren are of  peaches-and-cream fairness with eyes of coordinated lightness,  naturally. The granddaughter is a tall and beautiful girl  in trousers. The studs in her ears flash blue sparks.  Camac Street may have turned into  a marketplace but it is so easy to stumble upon royalty  here, even in our rough-and-ready times where nothing is  sacred. There is no mistaking that Dumraon House built in  1922 is a reference to a fiefdom in Bihar, whose titular  head still enjoys the appellation of maharaja. No 3E looks haunted from without.  The house belongs to the Singh Deos of Seraikella of Chhau  dance fame. But the royal flat is locked and the other residents  of the building wary of strangers. Two youngsters point  out a tiny gate behind the house where a solitary bulb is  burning in the dark. This is presumably the outhouse. A  woman sitting outside switches on a light inside a tiny  room. A man in a dhoti is lying on a cot. A raja in reduced  circumstances? The man takes my card and opens  another gate in the semi-darkness. He returns moments later  accompanied by another man, whose rosy skin and chiselled  nose speak volumes about his pedigree. He introduces himself  as Kamakhya Singh Deo, 50. He leads me to his quarters that  are simple and neat. But the postern he opens to let me  in reveals a large manicured lawn and flowerbeds with a  simul tree towering above them. As in Dumraon House, the  lawn is hemmed in on two sides by highrise apartments. Singh  Deo, a man of few words, says the tennis court was sold  off years ago and the Mansarovar building has come up on  that plot. Old houses seem to be caught in  a time warp. They preserve an era gone by. I meet three  generations of the Gooptu family in their residence at 7B  Middleton Street. The room of enormous proportions has a  fireplace  a common feature in these bungalows. The furniture  is heavy and dark. They moved into this house from Jorasanko  about 80 years ago. They went to English-medium schools  but are still Bengalis to the core. They speak of a time when the  quiet street was gaslit, itinerant children would sing carols  during Christmas and every noisy Hindu festival would be  celebrated with fervour at their home, much to the annoyance  of their European neighbours. Even 50-ish Deep remembers  their herd of 14 deer that would occasionally amble as far  as Chowringhee  the road was so secluded. A young girl in shorts with a  baby in her arms appears on the verandah. A lady of the  house passes by busily. She wears the sari workaday matronly-style.  The groundfloor of the house is an enormous Bata showroom  now. I gather from the Gooptu elders  that the two-storeyed building, where the state secretariat  has come up now, had some Russian connection and they remember  the music that wafted on the breeze on some nights. Another  friend remembers 22 Camac Street of yore, where the burrasahibs  of the Inchcape Group used to live once. Pantaloons and  Westside have been constructed there. The plot on which  the biggest man-made firetrap on Camac Street, Vardaan Market,  was built once belonged to the Ranas of Nepal. The heritage committee has allowed  Sir Biren Mookerjees residence to be separated from the  lawn and so it has been sold off to the highest bidder.  It is a parking lot now, and from the look of things, will  soon turn into a garbage dump. It is difficult to dissociate  Camac Street from its past. Now the street could earn the  distinction of having spawned a style of architecture whose  vulgarity and tawdriness is beyond compare.  The department stores  glass  boxes with acanthus-topped pilasters and grandiose gates   have the unreality of film sets. The state secretariat  is a colossal visage from which the features have been deleted   like the victim of an acid attack. No 4/1 Camac Street  is by far the best preserved bungalow, and even the shops  with their bull-nosed canopies that have opened on the groundfloor  are not at variance with its graciousness. The property of the ICICI Bank  next to the department stores waits to be demolished.

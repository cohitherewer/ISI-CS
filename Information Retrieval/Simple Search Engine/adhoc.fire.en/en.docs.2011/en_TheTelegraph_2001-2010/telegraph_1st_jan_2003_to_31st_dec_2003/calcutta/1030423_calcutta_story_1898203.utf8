The Telegraph - Calcutta
 It's Your Birthday So... Its your birthday so... Life fascinates you. You are a romantic, playful and appreciative of nature. Sudden changes in life may test your ability to adapt. Sometimes, you may over-react and jump to conclusions. Clarity in communication can help you deal with others. You may possess a brilliant brain, a creative streak or a laidback attitude, but whatever the case, luck is always on your side.   Copyright

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, August 13, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Pay a price for perfect pitch
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should a maintenance fee be added to ticket prices for matches at Salt Lake stadium? More answers will be published next week Slush soccer: The giant stadium deserves a better deal. Abul Fateh Kamruddin,
																		Hooghly. The proposal seems good, but its  effectiveness lies in proper utilisation of the funds. Sports-lovers,  who can brave several odds to buy a ticket for a match or  are ready to face a stampede and even a police lathicharge,  can take this extra load, too. Some kind of tax for development  may be added with the tickets. But the doubt remains whether  the money will be channelled in funding overseas tours of  officials, or for the stadiums upkeep.									

Mahasweta Saha,
																		Garia.  A maintenance fee should not be  added to ticket prices for matches at the Salt Lake stadium  though its true the condition of the playground is worse  than even an ordinary football field. The authorities entrusted  with the upkeep of the stadium must be serious in their  work. The onus lies on them.									

Tapan Pal,
																		Budge Budge Road. Definitely. The demarcation between  sports and entertainment is getting blurred by the day,  as both involve big bucks. Government money should not be  utilised for maintaining the stadium. It must be self-funded  and viewers should be ready to shoulder the expenses.									

Govinda Bakshi,
																		Budge Budge.  Toll charges are imposed for maintaining  roads, bridges and harbours all over the country. At present,  the state government is facing an acute financial crisis.  Naturally, it has become imperative to charge fees for the  upkeep of parks and public toilets. Fixing a price for maintaining  one of the largest stadiums in Asia is perfectly justified.									

Arunava Bose Chowdhury,
																		Barrackpore. I strongly oppose the idea. Every  year, the Salt Lake stadium hosts a string of entertainment  shows organised by clubs and associations and after every  such programme, the condition of the stadium worsens. Instead  of looking after the overall improvement of the stadium,  the authorities are concerned only with revenue generation.  Under such circumstances, spectators should not be subjected  to pay more for the callous attitude of the authorities.									

R.P. Majumdar,
																		Christopher Road. To keep a property in good condition,  it is necessary to maintain it properly. If there is no  provision for funds, there is no harm in building up a bank  by adding a paltry amount with ticket prices. The railways  and some government departments follow the practice in the  form of toll charges.									

B.N. Bose,
																		Dum Dum Park. The Salt Lake stadium is our citys  pride and has to be maintained properly. With prices of  commodities ever on the rise, upkeep of the stadium needs  more money. So, adding a maintenance fee with tickets is  not a bad idea. Some special methods may be implemented  so that water does not accumulate on the ground, making  it muddy and slippery.									

Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
																		Banamali Naskar Road. The Salt Lake stadium has a capacity  of more than a lakh spectators. In order to ensure safety  of so many people, the stadium needs to be maintained properly.  This requires a huge expenditure and there is no harm if  a maintenance fee is added to ticket prices. Those who frequent  the stadium to watch matches are certainly capable of shelling  out a little amount. We still remember the incident when,  during an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match, a gallery collapsed  on viewers for lack of maintenance. 									

Kanai Saha,
																		Gauri Bari Lane. The maintenance cost of the Salt  Lake stadium is very high and the aid from the state government  is insufficient. The proposal for adding an extra charge  with tickets is most welcome. But it should be restricted  to VIP tickets only. 									

Debashish Chakraborty,
																		Chitpur. A maintenance fee should definitely  be added to ticket prices for matches at the Salt Lake stadium.  During an East Bengal-Mohun Bagan match, supporters of the  losing team often become rowdy, hurling water bottles and  damaging the galleries. Some supporters also litter the  ground and spit wherever they like. The management of the  stadium has every right to generate funds for maintenance  by imposing an additional charge.									

P. Pramanik,
																		Santoshpur Avenue. The fee should have been imposed  much earlier. The maintenance cost of the stadium, including  staff salaries, should be met by keeping a portion of the  sale proceeds. But given the system in our country, it is  doubtful whether the funds will be properly utilised.									

Santosh Chakravarty,
																		Unique Park. Certainly not. The authorities  are responsible for its maintenance. The stadium is used  not only for soccer matches, but also athletics, soirees  and other shows. What should be the norm in those cases?  Besides, there is no guarantee that the extra income will  actually be used for the stadiums upkeep.  Joydeep Chatterjee,
																		Shyambazar. Adding a maintenance fee to ticket  prices for matches at the Salt Lake stadium is a good proposal.  Many visitors turn the field into a battleground after a  match by throwing bottles, glasses and paper rockets. There  is no harm if they are made to cough up a charge, but it  should not be heavy on the pocket.  T.R. Anand,
																		Budge Budge. Why not? With more and more important  games being held at the stadium, a lot of maintenance is  required to keep it in good shape. Funds are needed for  this, but it is debatable whether the authorities will channelise  the entire amount for the purpose. As spectators on the  ground, we dont want to face a mosquito menace as A.R.  Rehman did during his show there.

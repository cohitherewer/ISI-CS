 Friday, June 13, 2003 				 Cauldron of creativity
 Nupurchhanda Ghosh																								Creativity knows no boundaries. Once the fountain of creativity is unleashed, it expresses itself in myriad forms, sparkling like well-cut diamond, magnificent and regal in its own splendour. Nehru Childrens Museum is hosting a novel programme where the different streams of creativity  music, art and verse  will be expressed through a host of well-known talents: singer Nupurchhanda Ghosh, artist Babita Das, Subir Ghosh and Rajesh Gupta. The works of some of Tagores contemporaries, like Atulprosad Sen, Dwijendralal Roy and Rajanikanto Sen, have withstood the test of time and have found a place of their own in the annals of Bengali literature. Over the years, connoisseurs have not only helped to revive and popularise the works of these poets through music (chiefly) but have converted many discerning listeners into their ilks. Surey, Barney, Kavye is a multi-lingual programme of music, poetry and painting to hail the works of the three great poets. Nupurchhanda will infuse life to the lyrics. Dipankar Acharya will handle percussions. Subir Ghosh will recite the works of the poets in English (translated by Amitasree Ghosh) while Rajesh Gupta will recite their Hindi versions. Babita Das will visualise the emotion-filled melodies on canvases with rainbow colours from her paillette. Compere: Amit Roy.																								When: Tomorrow at 6.30 pm																								Where: Nehru Childrens Museum

 Tuesday, January 28, 2003 				 Strained ties spark twin suicides
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A strained relationship took a tragic twist on Monday when a son and his mother killed themselves in the space of a few hours.																								Biswanath Samaddar, 40, hanged himself from the ceiling of his bedroom, police said. A resident of Thakurpukurs Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Road, Biswanath was a Calcutta University employee and of sound financial condition, the police added. But his relations with his wife had soured.																								On Monday morning, she took a cup of tea to his bedroom on the first floor of their house. She became nervous when several knocks on the door elicited no response, said Chandan Neogi, inspector-in-charge of Thakurpukur police station.																								Biswanaths wife called in the neighbours, who broke the door and found his body hanging from the ceiling. The couple has a five-year-old daughter.																								According to Neogi, Biswanaths body was taken for post-mortem and then for cremation.																								During that time, his mother, Chhaya, 62, was alone at home. Unable to bear the shock of her sons death, she set herself on fire. The neighbours saw smoke billowing from the house and rushed in, only to find that Chhaya had already suffered severe burns. She was taken to Vidyasagar Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries, a police officer said.																								The double suicide has shocked neighbours.Biswanath and his mother did not get along with his wife. They would quarrel very often, recounted Shakti Mondal, a neighbour. However, we did not have an inkling that Biswanath would end his life, Mondal said. 																								Police are investigating a foul-play motive. We will interrogate Biswanaths wife after things settle down, Neogi said.

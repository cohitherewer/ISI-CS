 Friday, December 05, 2003  Breakfast in Chinatown
 Through sheer guts and grit many Chinese  who came with nothing have made it big today, says Soumitra  Das. But the community is on its way out Gee Hing Church in the shadow of a  highrise in Blackburn Lane. (Below) A Chinese provisions  shop in Chhatawala Gali The faded red-and-white signboard  reads Hap Hing. Established in 1934, it is the best-known  shop for provisions and Chinese medicines in old Chinatown  in the vicinity of Poddar Court but it never seemed to open.  The collapsible gate was drawn at all the usual working  hours. But S.L. Chen, who owns and runs the establishment  single-handedly, is a woman with a mind of her own and she  works when most of us dont  between six and 10 am. The ramshackle building that houses  Hap Hing looks at least a century old. S.L. Chen lives in  a large room in the courtyard of the same house. The grimy  groundfloor rooms are occupied by offices, minuscule workshops,  including one where sandesh is made, a grocery, and  a small Chinese eatery where chow is stir-fried at the entrance.  The building stands at the intersection of Sun Yatsen Street  and Chhatawala Gali. S.L. Chens single-room flat is  her castle. The entrance has its collapsible gate always  under lock and key. She lives alone. The curious cannot  peek inside. A screen ensures privacy. Unlike many Chinese  wary of strangers she is cordial. Perhaps because she has  confidence in her excellent English, obviously acquired  in an Anglo-Indian school. Yet whenever she speaks of the  dead she speaks in the present tense. For her, perhaps,  the dead are more living than the living themselves. There is a funereal air about  the room. One of the wooden beams is propped up with two  bamboo sticks. The two tables are laden with utensils and  flasks that you see only in Chinese homes. The only dash  of colour is provided by the red stickers with gold Chinese  characters pasted on the furniture and on the walls. Her  ancestors watch her from their photographs at the altar.  The bed is large. So is the sofa. S.L. Chen is a woman of considerable  girth, grit and guts. She tells the story of every Chinese  in India. For her the past is in the present. It is 1934  and her grandfather has arrived from Canton. He opens a  Chinese fruit and vegetables shop in the market situated  where Poddar Court is now. Where Calcutta Telephones Kendra  is now is a market. We could do our shopping without any  hindrance to traffic. Nowadays trucks can hit you, she  says. She is teaching in Ling Liang  school in the late Sixties when construction of Poddar Court  begins. The Hap Hing building is full of people from Hakka.  We live in two rooms on the Poddar Court spot. One is the  shop. The other is for living along with a small kitchen.  The terrace gets lots of sunshine. We climb a ladder to  reach it. It is still there. The leaves of mustard plants  (sarson saag) are dried there and salted. We put  it in a container from China. Only women know how to do  this. Before, only men came from China. So women came to  do this. As she relives the past she lets out a sharp cry.  They lived miserable lives. Some came with nothing. China  was at war. Japan was bombarding it. They usually sent their  sons to continue the family name. Money was not spent on  girls. Now those who have gone abroad think differently.  Her grandfather and father come  to India in the Thirties. Father starts working at 17 and  continues till age 73-74. S.L. Chen goes to Canada where  most of her siblings live. But she returns in 1991 to continue  the family business. She is never self-indulgent in her  anguish. Creases wrinkle the full moon of her face as she  cracks a joke about bowel movements and prunes that she  once imported in bulk from China but now in limited quantities. The next morning I find her drinking  tea at a stall outside her shop. This is the hour when a  Chinese breakfast is available there but only to early birds. Dumplings. Fishball soup. Steaming  pau stuffed with meat. Rice pudding sprinkled with  sesame seed. Chinese sausages. Sticky rice. Mushrooms. Fish  wafers. Oil sticks. The vacant lot between the Calcutta  Improvement Trust building and Poddar Court in India Exchange  Place Extension has turned into a bustling poultry-and-vegetables  market that remains alive for about three hours daily. All  the delicacies mentioned above and more are fleetingly available  a la carte on this spot. Men and women of Mongolian appearance  have put up stalls on and along the pavement. The dumplings  and pau are inside the gleaming aluminium steamers  set on stoves. The sausages are blood-red. A knot of people  eats soup crowded around a portable table. Once this movable feast was served  up only by the Chinese. Now the Sikkimese and the Tibetans  have joined the morning breakfast business, and so have  the Indian helps of the Chinese people who have migrated  elsewhere. When the Chinese were here in strength till the  Sixties, chow joints served up snacks such as Chinese buns  and pork roast all the time. Violet Chung, 60 plus, remembers  how her father supplied roast pig and duck to Great Eastern  Hotel and as a token of honour the Brits put up a signboard  in front of his shop, a rarity those days in Chinatown. In hard times the Chinese sweat  it out and later enjoy the fruits of labour. A man who lives  above Sea Voi Yune Leong Futh Church (1908) in Blackburn  Lane is there with his wife selling dumplings. Ping, 63,  for that is his name, used to repair ships but has retired.  The room dominated by a large bed is tiny but neat. I met Tseng Te Yu, 63, his Nepalese  wife Saraswati and their two daughters. Brass puja utensils  gleam in the showcase. A plump tabby cat sits on the bed  immobile as a figure carved from jade. The man may be a  cobbler but his single room is squeaky clean and his daughters  go to college. Christopher Lim, 49, sits in a  garret making shoes inside 36 Chhatawla Gali that the family  of Abbas Bengali, a Bohra, has owned since the Twenties.  Hundreds of forms of shoes hang from the loft. Behind  him is the Sacred Heart, tiny lights twinkling all over  the picture and a large photo of a Chinaman in robes, who,  he says came in 1927. Lim went to try his luck in Amritsar  but had to return during the Khalistani movement. On the ground floor of Gee Hing  church is Peter Chens large office. He runs his huge carpentry  from there. When T.C. Leongs father came to Calcutta 70  years ago, he carried furniture on his back all the way  to Bandel. Now the son has a flourishing steel furniture  factory. Most Chinese are on their way out but such success  stories can be heard all the time. Upcountry squatters, both Hindus  and Muslims, have usurped the space around the CIT building,  Calcutta Telephones Kendra, Sea Ip temple and Nanking restaurant.  They are resigned to their fate. (To be concluded)

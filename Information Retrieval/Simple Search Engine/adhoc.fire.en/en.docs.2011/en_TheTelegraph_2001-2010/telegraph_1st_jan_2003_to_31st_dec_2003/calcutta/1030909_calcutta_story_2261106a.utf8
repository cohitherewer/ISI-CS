The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, September 09, 2003  Children of a greater God
 An Eye on Calcutta / Barry  O BrienEvery holy book and management  bible will tell you that sometimes you need to get away  from the rat race and retreat within yourself  to search your soul. I know corporate heads who do it once  a year and priests and nuns who do it more often. Some retreat  to ashrams, others to Ayurveda Wellness Centres to meditate,  think, feel, re-focus, reaffirm and even cry. For some of us, The Telegraph  School Awards for Excellence has become our annual retreat.  The some of us includes principals, teachers,  students and parents, and amazingly, even priests, nuns  and corporate heads. It also includes my colleagues Biswanath,  Somnath, Partha and all at Heritage who have made it their  mission to find unsung heroes from villages unknown and  schools unheralded. We too meditate, think, feel, refocus,  reaffirm and even cry. Last Saturday, it was pilgrimage  day, the ashram once again being the Science City auditorium.  This time we had an economist-politician as our chief pilgrim.  You and I know that it takes a lot to move a mountain, more  to move an economist and even more to move a politician.  But our special pilgrim was Dr Manmohan Singh, an economist-politician  out-of-the-ordinary. He was moved, and he said so. Several  times in his speech he referred to how the extraordinary  spectacle of The Telegraph School Awards for Excellence,  in association with Khadims, had touched him so deeply. The spectacle was extraordinary because it was all about  ordinary people leading extraordinary lives without even  realising it, let alone expecting to be honoured for it.  It was about Dasarath Pandey of Rishra Vidyapith, who earns  11 rupees for every corpse he performs the last rites for.  Having had to take over prematurely from his asthmatic father  who had become allergic to smoke, Dasarath does  a corpse a day to support his family even on exam  days. In fact, on the mornings of most of his Madhyamik  papers, he would do his duty at Sreerampur Jaganath Burning  Ghat in Hooghly, then rush to the exam centre. From the  grief of experiencing death close up, a few hours later,  he had to adjust to the silence of the examination hall.  He did, and passed with a second division.		 Recipients of the Abhirup Bhadra Memorial  Thank you Baba-Maa Award, Pratima and Dulal  Ghosh (extreme right) greet Soumya Bhattacharya of BE  College Model School and parents Srabani and Parimal,  also recipients of the same award, at The Telegraph  School Awards for Excellence at Science City It was about Arpita Mitra of Dinhata  Girls High School, Cooch Behar, who passed the Madhyamik  relying solely on her lip-reading skills, because she is  100 per cent hearing and speech-impaired. It was about Nasim  Ali Mondol who scored 844 out of 1000 in this years  HS which is more than what his father earns every  month tying bidis. It was about Arnab Kar of Burdwan, who,  in spite of having the burden of a Rs 50,000-loan for his  fathers treatment, scored 91 per cent in the HS, ranked  186th in the Joint Entrance and is now studying at NRS Medical  College. It was about Pradip Singha, who helps his ma to  sell lal shak while his bedridden father stays home  a little hut near a garbage dump in the Dhapa area. That  didnt depress or distract Pradip; he scored 81 per  cent in the Madhyamik exams. It was about Gorachand Dutta,  the son of a thonga-seller in Panskura, who scored 88 per  cent; and Rupa Manna, the daughter of a fishmonger in Shibpur,  who won two golds and a silver at the 12th Yoga Olympiad  in Portugal in July this year; and Manirul Haque who lost  one hand and the use of the other, after being electrocuted.  Superboy Manirul, controlling the pen between his teeth,  scored more marks in his school-leaving exam than I did  with the pen firmly gripped between my fingers. As I stood beside these giants,  I felt so small, so humbled. I couldnt help but compare myself with them: with everything on a platter, I cant  achieve half the things they have. With everything running  for me, I cant get halfway to where they have. Or,  for that matter, where educators and founders like Bharati  Mitra and C.R. Gasper have taken Nava Nalanda and St Augustines  over the last three decades; or, for that matter, where  father-figures Dr M.C. Alexander and Basudeb Bhattacharya  have taken Grace Ling Liang and Hariyana Vidya Mandir. Theirs has been a lifetime  of dedication and devotion to their schools, which is why  Meera Singh of Chowringhee KG and Day School did not marry  and a galaxy of achievers of Ballygunge Government alumni  was there to salute Suprabhat Chakraborty. Saluting them  were corporates who care, and show that they care: Khadims,  Patton, Ambuja Cement, Sanjeevani, Eveready, Balrampur Chini  Mills, Frank Brothers, Guidance and the Apeejay Surrendra  group.		 Masud-ur-Rehman Baidya,  Manoj Ghosh and Temba Tsheri Sherpa Applauding them were schools that  had themselves excelled to be on the honours list: from  Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan and Salt Lake School to Agrasain  Balika Siksha Sadan, MC Kejriwal Vidyapeeth and Sunrise  in Liluah; from St Xaviers Institution in Panihati  to Dreamland School in Howrah and Little Star in Bally.  Every year schools, each so special, yet so different from  each other and so far apart, come together on the same stage.  Every year there is a theme that sets us thinking. Last  year it was the birth of a movement of peace and brotherhood,  with Martinian Souvik Banerjee promising to go to Pakistan  with the message. Souvik and I returned from Karachi earlier  this year, and though the killing continues and the mistrust  remains, our movement grows. Inshallah, if our visas come  through, 40 Souviks and I will go across to Pakistan next  January with a mother leading us from the front. She is  Shukla Bandopadhyay, who told a stunned audience that morning  that she would love to go with us to meet Pakistani mothers  who have lost their sons to this madness. She  lost her only son, Captain Anirban of the Gurkha Regiment,  shot through the heart defending his men in Kashmir on the  23rd of March last year. She doesnt want others to  lose theirs.While that movement continues, another began  with this years theme highlighted by the Chairman  of The Telegraph Education Foundation, Neil OBrien:  Are we putting too much pressure on our children?  Amidst spine-chilling facts that education-related suicide  deaths in India outnumber poverty and dowry-related ones,  Joydeep Palits Hritaal showed their class  in an electrifying performance to Suman and Anjans  schooler bag ta baddo bhadi.  The curtain rang down with a final  message of hope when the stage lit up with Katy Lai Roys  closing act with skaters trained by Madhuchhanda Sanyal  of M. B. Girls HS School. The star skaters of M. B. Girls  matched steps with those from Zenith of Lake Club as they  danced to the tune of Calcutta Internationals Shanu  Banerjee, as Dana Roy and the Ballygunge Shiksha Sadan choir  sang out orphan Annies message that the sun  will come out tomorrow. We left Science City with lumps  in our throats, wet handkerchiefs in our pockets and  humility in our hearts, convinced that the sun will definitely  come out for todays unknown heroes tomorrow  and forever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Monday, September 22, 2003 				 Tramway staff on troubled tracks
 Assembly point: Employees at the meeting  in front of the CTC office. Picture by Kishor Roy Choudhury Dilip Dutta: Tram services  are facing a serious crisis. The Gariahat route has been  withdrawn because of the flyover. Services in Taratala were  similarly suspended for a flyover under construction and  now we hear that the Park Circus tram line might be withdrawn  as well. If this goes on, what will happen to the CTC employees?  Apprehending an uncertain future, they are now resorting  to a movement. Will you please throw some light on this?																																																													You are right, but there is no need to get worried. Some work, part of the transport project, is still on. Once concretising work at Gariahat is complete, tram tracks are likely to be relaid. Moreover, it cannot be said that tram services have been totally suspended at Gariahat. Efforts are going on to restore the lines as early as possible. Suspending tram services from a particular zone for the development of the city is perfectly justifiable. If there is any proposal to withdraw the services finally, the government will have to find an alternative. The government is already in talks with two foreign companies for the development of tram services.

 Sunday, November 30, 2003 				 CAT students out of city links bag
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Four students had approached Sandip Ghosh before the common admission test (CAT) for the Indian Institute of Management (IIM)  officials of Bhowanipore police station announced on Saturday.																								Ghosh was produced in court on Saturday and remanded in police custody.																								The 27-year-old was rounded up from his Behari Doctor Road residence on Friday evening on the basis of a complaint lodged by Sambit Singha Roy of Baguiati whom he had assured admission to an MBBS course at an institution in Nepal in exchange for Rs 10 lakh.																								Sambits father Shyamalendu Singha Roy paid Ghosh Rs 5 lakh. When the scheduled date for admission lapsed, Sambits family lodged the complaint. Later while searching Ghoshs office, police found a diary which contained the name of Nalanda-based Ranjit Singh, the CAT paper leak scam mastermind arrested by the CBI.																								We are not sure whether the four students had paid him or not. Efforts are on to trace them. We have found a photocopy of an admit card of an IIM student, said Siddhartha Dutta, the investigating officer. Ghosh might have referred the students to Singh in exchange for a huge commission.																								Police carried out a raid to track down three others, including a woman in her mid-twenties. Ghosh and three others  Sangeeta Agarwal, Arindam Ghosh and Subrata Majumdar  ran the racket under the banner of a students consultancy firm, called Academy Heritage. They would guarantee admission to MBBS and engineering courses and overseas services. Sangeeta is a commerce graduate. We raided her Bhowanipore residence, but she was absent, said Dutta.																								Police said Ghosh and his partners would charge lakhs to help candidates clear the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). We are checking whether anyone succeeded in JEE through Ghoshs racket. There is a possibility of big shots being involved in the scam, Dutta added.																								Saturdays findings reinforce the suspicion that Ghosh had links with Singh, who is now in CBI custody. We have found Singhs landline number with a Nalanda STD code and a cellphone number, he said.																								Investigations revealed Ghosh to be a new entrant in the racket. He opened his firm six months ago. We are investigating whether Singh has spread his tentacles in Bengal, said the officer. Police will get in touch with the CBI on Monday. The detective department, too, examined Ghosh on Friday night. Mishap: Amritalal Roy,  40, a resident of Keshtopur, died after he was hit by a  private bus in Salt Lake on Saturday.

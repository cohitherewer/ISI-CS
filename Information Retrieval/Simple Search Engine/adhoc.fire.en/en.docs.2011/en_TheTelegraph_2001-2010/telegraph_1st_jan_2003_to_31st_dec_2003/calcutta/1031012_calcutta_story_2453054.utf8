 A STAFF REPORTER																								Manisha Mahapatra, a 25-year-old executive in a private firm, committed suicide at her Southern Avenue apartment on Friday night. Security guards of the housing complex and one of Manishas colleagues who resides in the same apartment noticed her hanging from the ceiling. They informed the Tollygunge police station.

According to security guard Gautam Tripathi, Manisha, who hailed from Jamshedpur and was living in the apartment for the past seven months, had returned from office around 7.30 pm as usual. Around 10 pm, her colleague found the door locked from inside. When there was no response on knocking repeatedly, we broke open the door and found her hanging from the ceiling, Tripathi added.																								We are looking for a youth who used to drop Manisha home, said an officer of Tollygunge police station.

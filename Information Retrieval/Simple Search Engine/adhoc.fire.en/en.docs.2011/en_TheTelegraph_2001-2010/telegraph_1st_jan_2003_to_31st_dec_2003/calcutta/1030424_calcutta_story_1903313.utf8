 Thursday, April 24, 2003 				 Two killed in twin road mishaps, drivers held
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Two persons died in twin road accidents in the city on Wednesday.																								Tragedy struck after Tuesday midnight on AJC Bose Road, when a lorry-driver lost control of his vehicle and mounted the pavement, killing a 14-year-old boy and injuring his elder brother. 																								On Harish Mukherjee Road, a 75-year-old woman was mowed down by the wheels of a lorry around 6 pm.																								Eyewitnesses told the police that around 2 am, a lorry, travelling at high speed from north to south along AJC Bose Road, suddenly swerved dangerously to the left. It seemed the driver was trying hard to control the vehicle, but before we realised what was happening, it climbed on to the footpath, crushing someone under its wheels, a pavement-dweller said.																								The badly-mangled body was identified as that of Amar Singh. The seriously injured person was Amars 33-year-old brother, Shankar. Local residents rushed Shankar to NRS Hospital, where he is in a critical condition, and Amar was declared brought dead at the hospital. The vehicle was impounded and the driver arrested.																								Around 6.10 pm, Snehlata Mehta, 75, was killed while attempting to cross Harish Mukherjee Road. A taxi, speeding recklessly to overtake other vehicles, rammed into Mehta, who was flung metres away by the force of the impact. The driver was beaten up and handed over to the police.

Not very many people remember Radha Charan Bagchi. A pioneer of modern Bengal Art, Bagchis (1910-1977) annal remains hidden in some obscure corner of art books. But his contribution to Bengal Art, as we have inherited in its present form, is immense. In fact, the history of Bengal Art would be incomplete if we exclude Bagchis name. A versatile artist, Bagchi could move rapidly from one medium to another, transforming his schooling as he went along. He would move from neo-Bengal school themes and variations through academic neo-classicism to post-Impressionist style of landscape rendering. His great virtuosity still mesmerises viewers. Bagchi was a master painter working in oil, tempera, opaque and transparent watercolour as well as wash painting style. Bagchis oil portraits, done frontally or in profile, speak of the various Western schoolings that he was attracted to. An exhibition of this forgotten pioneer revives memories of a bygone era.																								When: Till April 5: 3 pm - 7 pm																								Where: Galerie 88

		 Monday, October 20, 2003 				 A pledge to keep: books for all
		 Cure Station: The Charitable  health centre on Alimuddin Street. Picture by Kishor  Roy ChoudhuryMohammad Yunus: At the time of your election, you had promised to build a reading library for your educated voters. You had also said that men and women would have separate areas within the library to pursue their interests. Nothing has come up yet.																																																													I had made three pledges in my election campaign. I have fulfilled two of them. One was a free health centre. That is ready and patients are being treated on a regular basis. The other project is near completion  a park at Haji Mohammad Mohsin Square. The third project is the reading library. It will come up in another six months. There will be separate units for men and women and it will be open to all.

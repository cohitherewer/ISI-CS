 Friday, September 26, 2003 				 Clash erupts over puja subscription
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Trouble broke out on Thursday afternoon between two groups of residents of Padmapukur Birsul Haat, in the Entally area, when members of a local club tried to force a trader to pay a hefty puja subscription. As a consequence, two men, including the trader, suffered serious injuries. Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel were deployed in the area to avoid further violence.																								According to the police, at around 1.30 pm, members of Paribartan, a local club, demanded a subscription of Rs 101 from Eklak Ahmed, who deals in leather goods. When Ahmed refused to pay up, and instead handed over Rs 20, club members tried to force the money out of him. Following a brief quarrel, a fight broke out. The trader was outnumbered and severely beaten up, police said. 																								A local youth, Fazaluddin, who rushed to the spot to save Ahmed, was also manhandled. Both of them had to be admitted to Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital. Fazaluddin was later discharged but Ahmed is stated to be in a serious condition.																								Local residents were divided over the issue and the two groups fought a pitched battle. One of the groups hurled a country bomb but, luckily, it did not explode. An RAF team, along with officials of the local police station, were posted in the area, an official of Beniapukur police station said. 																								A resident of the area said members of Paribartan club create trouble every year over puja subscription. A complaint was made at the local police station but no one has been arrested yet.

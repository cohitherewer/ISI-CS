The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 For cancer patients, a care centre
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With cancer cases rising in Calcutta, specially of the terminally-ill variety, voluntary organisation Friends Foundation of Asia (FFA) inaugurated a hospice on Sunday for patients who have been battling the disease for years but have reached a stage where they can no longer take care of themselves.																								Modest estimates say 65,000 new cancer cases are reported in the city and state every year. More than 25,000 patients reach the terminal stage of the disease within a year of its detection. Several thousands of them die a painful death, uncared for.																								Keeping in view this pathetic situation, Somasree Roy, herself a cancer survivor, decided to form FFA with close friends. Its pilot project, the first hospice, was inaugurated in Santoshpur on Sunday. The sufferings of cancer patients can never be gauged. There are many people who die without medicine. We at FFA thought that a hospice, where patients could stay and get medical and psychological care, would be the best thing to happen in Calcutta now, said Roy, FFA general secretary. We have decided to take in patients from January 2004, she added.																								She plans to start a chain of such centres, where palliative care and attention will be given to cancer patients. This hospice is the first of its kind in the city. We will provide all kinds of facilities to patients and they will never feel they are away from home, said cancer surgeon and consultant Gautam Mukhopadhyay.																								FFA apart, Prerak is another voluntary organisation that provides palliative care to cancer and HIV patients in the city.

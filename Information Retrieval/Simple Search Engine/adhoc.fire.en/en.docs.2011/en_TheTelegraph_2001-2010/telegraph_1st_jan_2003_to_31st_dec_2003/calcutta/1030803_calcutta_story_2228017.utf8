 Sunday, August 03, 2003 				 Silence halts death probe
 A STAFF REPORTER																								She could provide vital leads to the grotesque killing of her mother. But her silence is proving to be a stumbling block for the investigators probing the murder of Sarbari Banerjee.																								The investigating agencies right from the local police station to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) focused on 17-year-old Sohini throughout Saturday, but the interrogation proved futile.																								An unidentified youth stabbed Sarbari when she opened the door on hearing the bell on Thursday afternoon at their Thakurpukur apartment. The assailant also stabbed her husband Jayanta, an officer of Canara Bank, who was transferred back in town from Assam only three days ago. Sohini was sleeping in her room all the while. 																								The kitchen knife was examined by CID sleuths as it was the only clue left by the killer. We are expecting a breakthrough soon, said Humayun Kabir, deputy superintendent of police, town.																								Meanwhile, seven officers left for Assam on Saturday. Police have prepared a portrait of the killer on the basis of the description provided by Jayanta, under treatment at Calcutta Medical Research Institute. Admission racket: Anil  Banerjee, 53, was rounded up from his Rashbehari Avenue  home on Saturday for duping students with promises of admission  in reputed medical colleges in Delhi. He was held on the  basis of a complaint by Mrinal Chatterjee, a Shipping Corporation  of India employee, who had sought Banerjees help in getting  his son a seat in a medical college.

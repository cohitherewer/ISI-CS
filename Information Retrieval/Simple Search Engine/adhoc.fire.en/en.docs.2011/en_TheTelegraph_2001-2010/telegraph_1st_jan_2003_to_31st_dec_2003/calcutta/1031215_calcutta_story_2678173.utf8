The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Port land to Hooghly heritage
 																											- CMDA to get 300 metres along waterfront for beautification SWATI SENGUPTA																								The riverfront is all set to acquire a new look. Union shipping minister Shatrughan Sinha has agreed to hand over 300 metres of the Hooghly riverfront to the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to start work on the development and beautification of the riverfront to the north of Millennium Park. The 300 metres are under the Calcutta Port Trust. 																								Sinha will officially announce the decision when he is in the city on December 30 for a river festival organised by the CMDA. However, he has asked me to begin work and process tenders for the CMDA to engage agencies for the purpose, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said on Sunday, after meeting Sinha. 																								George Nicholson, chairman of the London River Association (LRA), will meet Bhattacharya on Monday to discuss plans to develop a portion of the waterfront. Going by Sundays developments, Bhattacharya is hopeful that the shipping minister will soon greenlight the proposal to develop the warehouses. 																								So, its almost time for the decrepit warehouses to be spruced up. About three warehouses along the Hooghly, past Millennium Park, located adjacent to this 300-metre stretch, will be included in the project. 																								The stretch will be marked a heritage zone and developed retaining a feel of the past, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said on Sunday. Details of handing over the warehouses will be discussed with Sinha later, Bhattacharya said. Right now, we want to start the beautification of the riverfront, so that it looks like an extension of Millennium Park towards the north, he added. 																								At a later stage, most of these warehouses are likely to house shopping malls, restaurants, offices and so on, but without tampering with their architecture. Not just entrepreneurs in the state and elsewhere in the country, several investors from the UK, too, are interested in the project. We have not yet worked out the exact plans of the makeover. A project report will be prepared and submitted to the shipping minister soon. But well certainly take note of the ways in which the waterfront has been developed in London, Bhattacharya said. 																								Bhattacharya and Nirupam Sen have, of late, visited London and will both contribute to the waterfront development project. Already, the LRA has submitted a concept report on regeneration of the Calcutta waterfront to the government. The LRA will offer us technical help to develop the waterfront. We have been asked to form a committee to work out the details of the project, Bhattacharya added.

																								Calcuttans may have heard the name of British-Asian Kathak dancer Akram Khan when he performed in Mumbai recently. Born in London, Khan had been trained in Kathak by Pratap Pawar at the Academy of Indian Dance. He then studied contemporary dance at Dr Montfort University and later at the Northern School of Contemporary Dance in Leeds where he recorded the highest mark ever for his Performing Arts degree. He has performed globally, working with Pandit Ravi Shankar in The Jungle Book and later in Mahabharata, directed by Peter Brook. In August 2000, Khan launched his own dance company. The same year he was honoured with the Outstanding Newcomer to Dance Awards. Peter Brook again invited him to act in his film version of Hamlet. The Akram Khan Companys objective is to explore the relationship between Western modern dance techniques and the traditional Kathak. The creative emphasis is on the structural and mathematical elements that comprise each dance style. The desired aim is the development of a new and innovative movement language, which Khan describes as contemporary Kathak. This evening Khan performs (he has choreographed the show as well) Kaash along with Eulalia Ayguade, Rachel Krische, Moya Michael, Inn Pang Oni and Shanell Winlock. Set to music by Nitin Sawhney and with additional music Spectre by John Oswald played by The Kronos Quartret, this show is jointly hosted by the British Council and HSBC.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Kala Mandir

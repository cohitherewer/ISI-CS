The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, November 26, 2003  Arijit dutta								President, Eastern India Motion Pictures Association																																							There is no question of banning shooting on roads. But of course, one should not be allowed to roll the camera at say, the Dalhousie crossing, at peak hours, unless one is seeking a top shot. Shooting of films by directors from outside gets good publicity for us. It brings money to the state. Also, local technicians earn some money. In addition, it increases peoples associativeness. If a film is shot near my hall, Priya, I would want to see it. Proper planning, like adjustment of timings or traffic diversions, can ensure that the public is not affected.

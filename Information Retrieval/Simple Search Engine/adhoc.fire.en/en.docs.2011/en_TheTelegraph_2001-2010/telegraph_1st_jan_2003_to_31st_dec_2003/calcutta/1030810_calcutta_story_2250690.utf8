 Sunday, August 10, 2003 				 Truck stops for traffic flow
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE																								In a move to check air pollution and ease traffic congestion, the state government has decided to construct parking lots-cum-wholesale trading centres for trucks at seven entry points across the city.																								An expert committee, formed recently to find means to reduce auto-emission, has recommended restrictions on the movement of trucks in and around the city. The governments move, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, is aimed both at easing traffic snarls and checking environmental pollution.																								Trucks coming from different directions are parked in Burrabazar, which leads to traffic congestion and accumulation of garbage in the area. Flow of vehicles will be eased to a large extent if we shift the parking lots for trucks and venues for wholesale trading activities to places outside the city, Bhattacharya said.																								The seven centres will come up at Dankuni, New Township at Rajarhat, Noapara, Amtala, Baranagar, Budge Budge and the Port area. We have identified the sites and expect to start work after the monsoon, said a spokesperson for CMDA, which will implement the Rs 15-crore project in three years. Aimed at benefiting both transporters and wholesale traders, the centres will have the infrastructure for parking vehicles, loading and unloading goods, warehouses, night shelters and other facilities, said CMDA officials.																								The centres will be earmarked for trucks on various routes. For example, vehicles coming through Delhi Road or Mumbai Road will be parked either at Dankuni, Kona or Baranagar. Similarly, those plying along NH-34 will unload goods at the New Township centre, explained a CMDA official. Correction																								The name of Bakul Chatterjees son, who died last October, is Subrata and not Ranajit as mentioned in the article A fresher in college, 78, published in Metro, The Telegraph, August 9. The error is regretted.

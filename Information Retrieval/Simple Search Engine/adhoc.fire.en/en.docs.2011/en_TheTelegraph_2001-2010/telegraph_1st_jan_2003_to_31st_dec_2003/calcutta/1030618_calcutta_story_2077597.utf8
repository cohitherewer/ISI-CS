The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 18, 2003 A.S. Rawat								Senior manager, The Bank of Rajasthan Ltd																																							It is a joint responsibility. The bank must have guards as well as a state-of-the-art alarm system. But the guards can check thefts, not dacoits who come armed with the latest weapons and target the guards before they get a chance to take aim. Banks in Calcutta have been safe so far. But after this spate of dacoities, it is necessary to take more precautions. Increasing co-ordination with the local police station may be a good idea. The police must also react quickly whenever the bank alarm goes off.

 Wednesday, May 14, 2003 				 Suicide whiff in cop death
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Forty-year-old Ram Chandra Malik, a naik of the city armed polices First Battalion, died in a fall from the third-floor balcony of the Eighth Battalion barracks on BT Road on Tuesday afternoon. He suffered head injuries and was declared dead when taken to RG Kar Hospital. 																								The police are not certain whether Mullicks death was accidental or a suicide. Originally from Champarui, in Hooghly districts Magra, Malik was married in February this year. He lived with his wife in Thakurpukur. Malik was promoted from the Eighth Battalion to the First Battalion in 2001, and attended work at Bodyguard Lines.																								No suicide note was found, though initial suspicion was that Mullick had leapt to death. Preliminary information revealed that Mullick had arrived at the BT Road barracks in the morning. He used to be posted there earlier. Mullick told his former colleagues he wanted to use the toilet. The other jawans found that strange, as Mullick did not live in the barracks even while he was in the Eighth Battalion. His body has been sent for post-mortem to NRS Hospital.																								This is not the first incident of a mysterious death of a man in uniform. On April 13 this year, a 45-year-old sub-inspector of the Third Battalion, Biman Kumar Majumder, shot himself with his service revolver while on night duty, along with others, in a Heavy Radio Flying Squad vehicle at the Kidderpore crossing. He had left a suicide note behind.

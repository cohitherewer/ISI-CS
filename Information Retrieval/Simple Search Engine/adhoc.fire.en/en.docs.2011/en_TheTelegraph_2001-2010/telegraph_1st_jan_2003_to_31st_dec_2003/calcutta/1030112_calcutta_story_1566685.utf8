 Sunday, January 12, 2003 				 Theft in CM constituency
 A STAFF REPORTER																								In another case of a burglary in the chief ministers constituency, a team of two broke into an apartment of a housing complex in Panchashayar, on the citys southern fringes, early on Saturday.																								The incident created a panic among the residents who alleged that that even after repeated assurances by the chief minister, the Purba Jadavpur police had failed to make adequate security arrangements in the area.																								According to police, two persons broke into Nandita Bhattacharjees flat when she was sleeping in a room along with her son and daughter. One person entered the drawing room while the other stood guard at the main gate of the building. The thief took Rs 500 and three wrist watches from the room. Bhattacharjees daughter woke up and raised an alarm. However, the two managed to flee in the darkness, said Rajesh Singh, additional superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas.

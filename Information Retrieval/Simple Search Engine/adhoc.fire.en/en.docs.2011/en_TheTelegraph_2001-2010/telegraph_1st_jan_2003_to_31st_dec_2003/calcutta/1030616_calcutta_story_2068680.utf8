The Seagull Foundation for the Arts hosts a special screening of War amp; Peace  Jung Aur Aman, a documentary directed and produced by Anand Patwardhan (picture above). Filmed over three tumultuous years in India, Pakistan, Japan and the USA, the film is a journey of peace activism in the face of global militarism and war. Triggered by macabre scenes of jubilation that greeted nuclear testing in the Indian subcontinent, the film is framed by the murder of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. For Patwardhan, whose family was immersed in the non-violent Gandhian movement, the sub- continents trajectory towards unabashed militarism is explored with sorrow, though the film captures stories of resistance along the way. Amongst these is a visit to the enemy country of Pakistan, where contrary to expectations, Indian delegates are showered by affection not only by their counterparts in the peace movement but by uninitiated common folk. As we enter the 21st century, war has become perennial, enemies are re-invented and economies are inextricably tied to the production and sale of weapons. Winner of several prestigious international awards for his politically-charged documentaries, Patwardhan will be present to introduce Jung Aur Aman and to interact with the audience.																								 When: Today at 5.30 pm																								 Where: Max Mueller Bhavan

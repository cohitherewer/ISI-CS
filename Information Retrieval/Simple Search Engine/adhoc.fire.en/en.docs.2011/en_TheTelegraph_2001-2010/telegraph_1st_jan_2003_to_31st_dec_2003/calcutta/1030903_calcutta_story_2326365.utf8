The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, September 03, 2003 				 Lockhorn letters in CAS chaos
 															- Govt discovers more grey areas, refuses to set deadline OUR BUREAU The chaos over conditional access  system (CAS) ruled Writers Buildings on Tuesday with a  series of meetings between government officials, industry  players and consumer group representatives inching from  one grey area to another. At the end of the day, the stalemate  over CAS continued, with no date being set for the set-top  regime to roll out. If anything, the chasm between  the Union information and broadcasting (I amp;B) ministry  and the Bengal government  created since Delhi was allowed  to push back CAS  widened with Writers discovering fresh  stumbling blocks stopping the system from entering cable  and satellite homes in Zone I.																								The government on Tuesday decided to send another letter to the I amp;B ministry in a day or two, seeking further clarifications. The Centre has not answered most of our queries in the earlier letter. They cannot pressure us to implement CAS because even if broadcasting is under their control, the state is the implementing agency here. Moreover, we have to deal with law and order and consumers interests, said Basudeb Banerjee, state information and culture secretary.																								We are not setting any time frame by which CAS may or may not be introduced in Calcutta, Banerjee announced, after a marathon meeting with multi-system operators (MSOs), cable operators and consumer groups.																								It is not clear to consumers what channels they might be able to watch if they do not opt for the pay channels. What does a Bengali household do if most of the (free-to-air) channels they start receiving turn out to be in Tamil? Consumers have the right to this information, stressed Banerjee.																								The I amp;B ministry has decreed that a minimum of 30 free-to-air channels must be beamed for a monthly fee of Rs 72, plus local taxes. While broad genres like news and entertainment have been demarcated, the exact product mix for the free-to-air package has been left to the cable operator, dictated by demand.																								But confusion continued to be the key component of all things CAS at Writers as the government blamed the MSOs for not reaching out to consumers at the ground level. This, said Banerjee, was evident  as service providers RPG Netcom, SitiCable and Manthan were  not clear about the exact number of set-top boxes that  might be required. No one seems to have conducted any survey  keeping the consumers interests or demands in mind, he  said.																								A series of meetings was held at Writers Buildings throughout the day, initially involving chief secretary S.N. Roy, police commissioner Sujoy Chakraborty, district magistrate of South 24-Parganas Vivek Kumar and the information and culture secretary. Banerjee later met industry representatives and said he was considering a proposal to set up a core CAS committee.																								Mrinal Chatterjee, member of the central CAS task force, said: The sooner CAS is implemented, the better for all the stakeholders of the industry. RPG Netcom CEO Amit Nag added: We are waiting for the governments instructions before our next move.

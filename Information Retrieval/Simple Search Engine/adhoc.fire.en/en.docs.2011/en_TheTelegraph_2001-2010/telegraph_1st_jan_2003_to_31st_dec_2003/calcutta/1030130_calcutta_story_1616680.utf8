				 				 				 			Taj Bengal, in association with Hiland Park and Spandan Art Gallery, hosts a unique art exhibition showcasing the works of 10 well-known city artists. This display is the culmination of four days of dynamic creative action in an art camp that was organised at Hiland Park  an event that focused on the power of art as a medium of creative expression and also one that inspired art enthusiasts and connoisseurs to address themselves to social concerns. The 10 participants (Partha Bhattacharjee, Sanatan Dinda, Sukanto Das, Kanchanmala Ghosh, Samir Paul, Ambarish Nandan, Avijit Dutta, Dewasish Das, Gauranga Bashai and Soumen Saha)  all in search of a fiercely individual style of expression  received ample opportunity to interact and work together in harmony and create works which are impressive in terms of variety, subject and style. The 30 canvases created during the camp are on view today. Proceeds from the sale of the painting will be donated to the Chief Ministers Relief Fund.																								When: Today; 7 pm onwards																								Where: Taj Terrace, Taj Bengal

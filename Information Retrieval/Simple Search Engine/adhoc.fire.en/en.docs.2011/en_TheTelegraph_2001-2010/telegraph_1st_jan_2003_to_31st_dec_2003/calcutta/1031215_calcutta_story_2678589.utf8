The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Monday, December 15, 2003 				 Tip ensures litter takeaway
				 	 APARNA NIYOGI, Trinamul Congress councillor of ward no. 70 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC), met readers of The Telegraph at her ward office, on Mohini Mohan Road, to reply to their queries. Participants included Usha Banerjee, Rabindranath Roy, Champa Mukherjee, Tapan Mitra, Bithi Sarkar, Bobby Bose, Debabrata Roy, Chhaya Dey, Harminder Singh, Ramesh Chowdhury, Swadesh Saha, Sumalay Banerjee, Amarnath Chakraborty and Biswanath Burman				 																																																																																																																																																																		
	 Debabrata Roy: I pay conservancy tax regularly. I have a shop and the daily waste is stored in a drum but the civic workers do not clean it. To make them do so, I am forced to pay them a token sum every day. The second problem is that Justice Dwarkanath Road has not been repaired for quite some time.																																																			You have brought a very serious charge against the workers. Please give me a written complaint and I will suspend them. Though it will be very harsh on them, it should serve as a warning for the other workers. 																																																											About the second problem, I want to add that the bowl shape of Dwarkanath Road adds to its problem. The area is prone to waterlogging. But I am happy to announce that things will be taken care of soon. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has offered full cooperation and we will start a massive project, worth a crore, to raise the level of the road and instal a lifting station. This will solve the problem. Wait for the flyover work to finish first. 																																																									

Bithi Sarkar: Shops on Puddapukur Road dump their litter on my doorstep. Several requests have gone in vain.																																																			Some residents and businessmen are to be blamed for the nuisance. I think we must find legal means to stop them. Let me see what I can do. I had tried to clean up the stretch you are talking about. A doctor had opened his chamber on that stretch and I had helped him restore the spot and place flower pots to keep the place clean. All my efforts went to waste.																																																									

Bobby Bose: My house is on the crossing of Mohini Mohan Road and Abhay Sarkar Road. The CMC has encroached on part of the footpath to build a platform around a tree for its workers to sit on. But soon after the CMC workers leave, a full-time eatery is run from the spot. This food is cooked on clay ovens and the smoke pervades the area. Also, quite a few handcarts for removing garbage are parked near the spot.																																																			I request you to give me a written complaint and I promise to attend to it. I am totally opposed to encroachments, be it by the corporation or any other body. I will also try and find out an alternative spot for keeping the handcarts.																																																									

Harminder Singh: I have a shop on Puddapukur Road. My father set it up in 1959. Of late, I am losing customers, because of a meat shop that has come up next door. I have requested the owner several times to block the common wall he has erected. He has also installed an exhaust fan on my side of the shop.																																																			Please rest assured I will try to do all that I can so both of you can ply your trade. I will also see to it that he keeps the area clean so you do not lose customers.																																																									

Biswanath Burman: I am a resident of Chakraberia Road (South). We need a tubewell. Also, earlier, you used to make daily rounds of your ward. Now, we can meet you only in your office on specified days. I feel you should resume your tours.																																																			As far as the tubewell goes, it is not a problem, as I have some in stock. But people often oppose installation of one in front of their house. You talk to your neighbours and let me know the spot. I will get the work done.																																																											I no longer make the rounds of my ward, thats true. Perhaps you are not aware that I have been made a chief-whip of my party, like Mala Roy, and that job, too, keeps me busy. But whenever my assistance is sought, I visit the spot at the earliest. I assure all the residents of my ward that they can come to me with their problems. I promise to attend to them. Concluded

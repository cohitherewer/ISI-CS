The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Our memories are made of...
 The Great Indian  Huddle: Souravs boys in South Africa. Kalpana Chawla:  Bidding adieu Another year has gone, but the  memorable moments, good and bad, will live on in the hearts  and minds of the young and the impressionable. Cricket to  Kalpana Chawla, there were many inspiring and tragic events  that shook the world in 2003. Heres a look at what some  Young Metro readers had to say when we asked  them what they would remember 2003 for. More letters next  week.				 				 																															lI will remember 2003 as the year of Indian cricket. India not only performed marvellously in the World Cup, but is also playing excellently in Australia. Lets hope every year can be this good. Nidhi Dokania,
 Class XI, Ashok Hall The year has been a mixed one.  It had its share of tragedy, comedy, humour and romance.  But the most lamentable moment was the death of Kalpana  Chawla. She was a brave, young soul. This icon dreamt of  going to space, which she accomplished, and she would have  been happy to know that she helped pave the way for many  more dreams to come true.				 				 																															Tanmoy Das Lala Many events took place in 2003.  Some will make it into the records and history books, others  will live on in the minds of people. One thing I will remember  is the hooliganism of the US in Iraq and the fall of Saddam  Hussein. Another is Sourav Gangulys team missing the bus  in the World Cup final. On a personal note, this will go  down as the year I passed my HS exam and started college.  Sayan Ghosh, 
 Ist year, Bidhannagar College This was the year of the cricket  World Cup, which saw the Indian team scale new heights.  Also, the team spirit displayed by our boys during the final  fight on the field won our hearts, although we lost the  match and the Cup. Saurabh Dhanuka,
 Class XI, Birla High School I would like to remember 2003  for the wonderful performance by the Indian team in the  cricket World Cup. Their performance in the first two league  matches was disappointing. But they bounced back in the  third game and from then on, they played with the golden  touch, winning everything. Despite losing the finals, I  thank Sourav Ganguly and his team for a splendid show. The  tournament also proved lucky for the Netherlands. In only  their second World Cup appearance, they stunned everyone  by their professional display. The year will also be remembered  for the little lady who achieved big things  Kalpana Chawla.  She went where no other Indian woman has gone before.  Even in death, she will continue to live on in our hearts. Subhobrata Basu,
 Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan I will remember 2003 for a mixture  of events, good and bad. Among the tragedies, there was  communal violence in Gujarat and ethnic riots in Assam.  The spotlight swung on the condition of city hospitals,  revealing the inadequacy and corruption that pervades the  health department. Then there was the CAT scandal. But even  the darkest cloud has a silver lining. One event that touched  my heart was the honesty of a home guard who returned a  bag he had found on the road, containing a few lakh rupees.

	 Tuneful contests				 				 																															It was time for Dhun 2003, the annual college fest of Bidhannagar College, Calcutta, from December 18 to 21 on the college premises. The events were open to all, and the competition was tough.				 				 																															The first event was the Rabindrasangeet contest, followed by antakshari and the solo competition. Day II began with the quiz. Next was guest band Jhar. After that was a challenge to the girls to eat as many phuchkas as possible within a minute. It was followed by the choreography competition, where the participants from City College and Lady Brabourne reigned supreme.				 				 																															Day III featured the skit competition, for the first time. Ayan Ghosh of the host college bagged the top honours for his acting skills. Then, it was a challenge to the guys to eat the maximum rosogollas in 30 seconds. Spot dancing was next. The last event of the day was a performance by guest band Mirage.				 				 																															On the final day, about 11,000 people had gathered in the college to witness the performances of two leading Bangla bands  Fossil and Cactus. All in all, it was four days of fun.  Sayan Ghosh,

	 Yuletime cheers				 				 																															Christmas wasnt the same for 1,500 children from various city NGOs like Apeejay Anand Childrens Library, Don Bosco Night School, Sabera Foundation, IPER, and Rainbow Project. Former Interact District Council secretary Rishabh Bapna had organised a Christmas bash for them at the Don Bosco Park Circus grounds on December 25 with support from the Interact District Council and Interact Clubs.				 				 																															After a sumptuous meal, the kids enjoyed DJ Akashs mix-n-match tunes. Following a singing session, the main attraction arrived in the form of Sonu Nigam. He enthralled the children for 45 minutes, with his hits from Saathiya, Kal Ho Naa Ho and his own albums, like Bijuriya. The youngsters had a ball dancing along, while Sonu promised to come back next year. The children also received gift hampers from Santa Clause.				 				 																															For some, the memorable moment was having Sonu sing for them; for others, it was watching a DJ in action or meeting Santa. But after spending Christmas begging on the road and eating leftover cakes thrown in rubbish bins, this year was truly special.  Sangeet Shirodkar,
 President, Interact Club of Apeejay School		 Viva sets the St Xaviers campus on fire  at Beyond Barriers Chapter 5, presented in association  with The Telegraph. Picture by Pabitra DasRock back				 				 																															Beyond Barriers Chapter 5 was another opportunity for students to have some fun, with a whole lot of music and dancing. In the spotlight this time were teen sensations Viva and Aasma. The stage was set on the St Xaviers College campus and the reason to celebrate was the alumni association meet. 				 				 																															Following three days of fun-filled activities during Xavotsav, the two bands took the stage on December 23. After the inauguration, Tritha Sinha, a third-year student, rocked the audience with some sizzling numbers like Sharara sharara and Zara zara. Next on stage were Mohua, Anushka, Neha and Pratichi of Viva, who set the audience on fire with some hot numbers from their albums, like Jago zara and Chori chori, as well as a few film songs.				 				 																															Aasma struck the right chord with their debut hit Chandu ke chacha. They were greeted with cheers and yells from the 8,000-plus audience. Jimmy, Sangeet, Nitie and Vasudha also displayed the right moves in tune with their music. The event also featured the likes of singer Sandeep Vyas and city-based dance group Beatbusters.				 				 																															The turn-out was terrific and the environment was electrifying. The hard work put into the event by the alumni members, with support from the student volunteers, paid off.  Sandip Kundu,
 St Xaviers College				 				 																															
	 Notes on networking				 				 																															Personal computing is fine, but with networking gaining importance, distributed computing is the order of the day. Recognising the importance of distributed computing in todays environment, IIM Calcutta, in association with Jadavpur University and Colombo Plan Staff College, had organised the fifth international workshop on distributed computing in the city, from December 28 to 30.				 				 																															The workshop acts as a forum to present the latest research findings on the use of distributed and/or networked systems for effective computing. During the three-day programme at Joka, over 100 participants discussed learning optimisation, algorithms, web computing, the Internet, wireless and mobile networking, optical network systems and security. Coming up... 				 				 																															... is Theatrecians 10th production and its third original work, U is that you, on January 2, at Gyan Manch. The 1-hour-20-minute play takes a look at ethical issues plaguing humanity in the face of increasing scientific developments, and the constant question of crossing the line.				 				 																															Also, dont miss the 11th state-level computer fair in progress at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum.

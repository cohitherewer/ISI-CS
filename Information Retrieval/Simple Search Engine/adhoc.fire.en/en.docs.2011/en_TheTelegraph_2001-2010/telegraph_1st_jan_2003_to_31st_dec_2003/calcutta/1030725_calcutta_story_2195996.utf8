Diyas Gallery began its foray in the world of art and aesthetics with its inaugural show titled New Beginnings on and from July 18. This exhibition showcases the works of Indias venerable talent shoulder-to-shoulder with the creations of emerging artists and sculptors. The carefully-put-together collection has mesmerising oils and drawings by masters like Prokash Karmakar, Suhas Roy, Wasim Kapur, Shuvaprasanna, Shipra Bhattacharya, Partho Bhattacharya and Shyam Kanu Faujdar. Abstract art works using a kaleidoscope of colours by Pradip Rakshit and Samit Dey share space with younger talents including Shyamal Apto, Tapas and Subroto, who display a versatile range of work. Stylised, experimental sculptures of fibre glass, black and white marbles, bronze, metals and terracotta complement the Idiyas world of vast imagination and intricate design.

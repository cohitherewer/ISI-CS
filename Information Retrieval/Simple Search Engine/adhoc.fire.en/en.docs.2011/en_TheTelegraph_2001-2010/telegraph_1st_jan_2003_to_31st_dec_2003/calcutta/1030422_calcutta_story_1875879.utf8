The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, April 22, 2003 				 Civic frown on showroom
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has lodged a complaint against the promoters of a motor-car service station at Dhapa, in east Calcutta, allegedly without the requisite clearance from the civic body.																								Ashok Roychaudhury, director-general, civic buildings department, said on Monday: We have lodged a first information report at Tiljala police station against the illegal construction. This has been done under instruction of municipal commissioner Debasis Som.																								Bothra Service Station has been set up at Dhapa for repairs and maintenance of Ford Ikon cars. We had asked them (the showroom owners) not to construct any such structure without obtaining clearance from our buildings department. But they paid no heed and went ahead to set up the service station on a plot that is disputed, said member, mayor-in-council (buildings) Swapan Samaddar. 																								The matter came to light about two weeks ago when Samaddar, along with local councillor Javed Ahmed Khan and director-general (buildings) Ashok Roychaudhury inspected the site. The building department, according to Samaddar, is also examining papers that have been submitted to it, alleging that the construction has come up on an unassessed site, which is actually part of a bigger plot the government had acquired in 1980 for the CMC, by a gazette notification. The CMCs Gariahat office allotted premises numbers after mutation last year, civic officials said. 																								Thats nonsense. We have constructed the showroom on our own plot, asserted Bijoy Kumar Bothra. Since the plot does not belong to the CMC and actually falls outside its jurisdiction, we felt we could always construct the unit without seeking its sanction, he added. 																								Though the assistant assessor and collector of ward no. 66 have issued notices against the mutation in June, the CMC is yet to annul the mutation. If the Bothras submit a construction proposal with the title right over the plot, we will offer post facto approval, against payment of requisite fees and penalty, said director-general Roychaudhury.

																																																																																		Calcutta High Court on Friday directed the chief engineer, Public Health Engineering (PHE), to be present in court on August 1 and file a report on the condition of drinking water supplied in public places like hospitals, railway stations, schools, colleges and government establishments of the city. The court also directed the city civic authorities to file a report, stating the steps taken to carry out an earlier directive of the court asking them to monitor the drinking water supply system in public places. The court, in September last year, had directed the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to make arrangements for testing samples of the water supplied to public places. The court passed the order on the basis of a petition filed by environment activist Subhas Dutta, who collected water samples from different parts of the city and had them tested at a reputed laboratory. Results of the tests showed that the drinking water supplied to most of the public places were not fit for human consumption. Dutta had filed these reports before the green bench presided over by Chief Justice A.K. Mathur.

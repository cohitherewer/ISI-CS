The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Tuesday, December 30, 2003  The K factor
 An Eye on Calcutta / Barry  O Brien On my last seven trips to the  airport, a cat, black or otherwise, crossed the street.  Pappu, my James at the time, grumbled that bad luck was  round the corner. On each occasion, my flight took off on  schedule and the trip was fruitful. Unfortunately, on the  way to the airport the eighth time, no feline jaywalker  crossed our path, my flight took off some four hours late  and the client I was on my way to meet, couldnt wait that  long. From that day, Pappu took his grandma on head-to-head  as he preached against superstition.																								For me, superstitions are for the circular file  the wastepaper basket! Perhaps I should alter the tense and say were. Read on and believe what you will.																								Some months ago, a columnist in black and a South Indian lady with a big teeka and an even bigger voice, got you and Calcuttans around the world excited about the Park Street Festival. December 12, 13, 14 were the dates; Writers Building and KMC were with it all the way; Lalbazar, too, was all for it because it was going to be a party to celebrate a street that was born to party. One superstitious friend of mine, who has added a k to his companys name, to change his kismet and his kash balance, pestered me to call our festival the Kolkata Park Street Festival. Then, and only then will it happen! Believe me, you will only be a part of a festival if it starts with a k, the kartoon konkluded.																								I never even discussed this with my ko-host Usha Uthup and was konfident that the kops would kontinue to kooperate. Unfortunately, stating reasons of traffik disruption, Lalbazar kouldnt allow us to hit the street or even the pavement, for the Festival. We would have to stay indoors and rock the city. We kould have; perhaps we should have; but we didnt. Would a festival be a festival without the kommon man being a part of it? we wondered. Not quite, we konkluded. Well request the Chief Minister, we decided, and thats what were going to do. Weve missed the festive bus, but were running to catch another. Apologies for getting you all so excited, but we arent giving in  korbo-ee, korbo!																								Koincidentally, the week before last, I was in the kompany of the patron saints of the K-team, RaKesh and HrithiK Roshan  at the Emami Beauty Secrets by Madhuri Anandolok Awards. On stage, I was tempted to ask them, Kaho Na k se itna Pyar Hain kyo? Instead I asked Hrithik about being in Dads shadow and the charming young fellow won another big fat fan with his answer: With Dad, there are no shadows; only sunshine!																								Dad too was graceful as he paid a tribute to the women in his family  starting with his Bengali mother. Before the starry-starry night konkluded at Science City, Koi aur k Mil Gaya with a Calcutta konnektion: Kareena Kapoor. Her great-grandfather, Prithviraj, worked here before he took the family on a one-way ticket to Bollywood. Kareena was here to accept an award for her performance in Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon; the Roshans were receiving kudos for Koi Mil Gaya.  A river runs through it While Kareena, the Roshans and  Karan Johar were swearing by their good lucK charm, I was  left brooding over the lacK of it. Then, suddenly, my kismet  changed. Like my kartoon friend had predikted, I was participating  in a festival whose name began with a K  the Kolkata Karnival  organised by the British Deputy High Commission. Kan you  believe it! 																								I was invited to kondukt the UK-India Quiz 2003, a part of the Karnival, on the banks of the river at Millennium Park. As I asked a team to hurry up and answer a question, I joked, You must answer before that launch passes us. Lovers kuddled up in the audience as the 32 teams warmed up in the preliminary round. Things hotted up  in the quiz, that is  as the citys top team, DI (A), dropped anchor and kruised to a win. Saturday Club did rock their boat for a while before sailing in second, while Indian Institute of Juridicial Sciences berthed in third. But more than the TV sets, musik systems and thousands of rupees the teams and the audience won that night, what made the Quiz one of the most memorable I have kondukted, was the setting. As a child I had two riverside wishes: to listen to Silent Night with my eyes shut as the river breeze hit my face and to sing the National Anthem on the banks of the river as I looked as far as I could on a cool winters night. Both were fulfilled. I played Silent Night in the audio round and asked in which Indian film was it an important part of the background score? 36 Chowringhee Lane, in case youre interested. Finally, after the prize distribution, we let the magik of the night sink in as the likes of Lata, Asha, Bhimsen Joshi and A.R. Rehman soothed us with Jana Gana Mana. It had us on our feet, hair standing from every pore.				 	 A view of the Hooghly  a river that has in the past been witness to countless joys and sorrows and which, along with the Strand, promises to be the venue of many an exciting event in the near future 																								The river and its banks have brought us Kabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. Until 1820, pirates were hanged from gibbets by the river. After 1820, the punishment was drowning, off Prinsep Ghat. We live in happier times. People now come here to drown their sorrows, up their spirits, spend quality time with the family or let kupid do the talking. With the success of Millennium Park, the ambitious projekts being worked on by the State Government in sync with the London Rivers Association, and events like the Kolkata Karnival promising to become red-letter days on the citys kultural kalendar, we can look forward to the river and the Strand becoming a part of our lives again. 																								Apparently, the Hooghlys romance inspired a ships mate to write his first short story after he sailed on it from Singapore enroute to Dundee. The year was 1885; the sailor was Joseph Conrad  perhaps the greatest third-language writer of all time  his first two being Polish and Russian. 																								Let the romance of Conrads works find its way back into this kaptivating river where Kuch Kuch always Hota Hai. As for you and me  lets spend pleasant evenings with the family there. Kal Ho Na Ho, then definitely some day soon.

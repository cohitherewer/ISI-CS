  Born free: Birds and other pets deserve  a life outside bars. With due respect to our ex-chief minister and CPM leader Jyoti Basu, I would like to suggest that what is happening to our hospitals these days, probably also happened during his days (Party bid to ease Mishras burden, October 23). There is no reason to believe that the hospitals and doctors of West Bengal started to rot only after Basu left office, not long ago. The real difference today is that the people and the media have become more aware about malpractices. There is little dispute that medical negligence has plagued West Bengal during the entire period of the Left Front rule and probably, even prior to that. Indeed, it is a step forward that the media at least is reporting the regular incidence of medical negligence more freely today than they have ever did during Basus rule.  More reports of hospital malfunctioning do not necessarily mean that Prasanta Sur, the health minister during Basus regime, performed a better job than the present health minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra.  Kunal Saha,
 President, People for Better Treatment,
 Ohio, USA.  The sale and confinement of birds is a crime that has to stop forever (If you love a bird, set it free, October 31). Not only birds, caging any animal as a pet is not justifiable. Such acts are inhuman. But the appeal for their freedom will not materialise if the endeavour ends with just one campaign to mark wildlife week. Public awareness is very important, especially the involvement of children.  Dinabandhu Mukherjee, 
 Behala.  The government plea to all bird-lovers  to set their caged pets free shows the humane face of those  in power. This is one good deed the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  government deserves to be applauded for. The number of birds  in and around the city is decreasing due to congestion and  lack of greenery. Besides, some wrong-doers are also involved  in trapping and selling birds. This should be firmly dealt  with. Prahlad Agarwala,
 Majdia.  Criminals like Dhananjay Chatterjee deserve nothing less than a death sentence, so that others will think twice before following in his footsteps (Nine years to knot the noose, October 30). The case rings an alarm bell as to what the future may have in store.  Kunal Ray, 
 Santragachhi.  The attitude of the Left Front  government is weird. It took them nine long years to ask  for a court nod to go ahead with the death sentence awarded  to Dhananjay Chatterjee. If the state is run by civilised  and educated people, how could they turn a deaf ear to the  Presidents verdict? C. Roy,
 Address not given.  It appears that the state government  sat on the Presidents decision for nine years, allowing  the killer to live all this while, though he did not deserve  to. Dhananjay Chatterjee has committed an unpardonable offence  and the harshest punishment given to him seems inadequate.  Sunil Banerjee, 
 VIP Road.  Shuttle taxis for a cheap and comfortable journey (Rush hour green light for shuttle taxis, November 1) will probably take the same path as minibuses did when they were introduced. These buses, with a higher fare structure, were also meant for people who could afford to travel in comfort. The comfort vanished soon, but the fare remained.  Md. Moinuddin,
 Ballygunge.  The article Valiant tread in March marks (May 27) featuring me has bolstered my strength to face the hardships of life. After reading the article, the Sikh Nari Manch came forward to help me financially and get me admitted to a reputed college. I appreciate their effort.  Harmanjot Kaur,
 Address not given.  The report Torture by in-laws blamed for suicide (October 30) is a tale of torture which pushed an innocent girl to death. Why dont these people think what it would be like if their daughters are treated the same way by their in-laws?  Rimli Datta,
 Salt Lake.

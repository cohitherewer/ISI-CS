The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, May 21, 2003 					 					 It's Your Birthday So... You have a very busy time  ahead. Take a break and have fun. Too much display of affection  makes you feel trapped. A new friendship is on the cards.  You are imaginative and creative. Sometimes, you lose focus  in your work. A little splurging will make you happy.  Kusum Bhandari

 Wednesday, August 13, 2003 				 Behala bleeds under baton
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Independence Day week has begun on a bloody note in Behala, with residents accusing police of brutality following a flare-up late on Monday. By Tuesday evening, nearly 50 residents of Sahapur had been arrested, traffic and life thrown out of gear, and support was being drummed up to move the state human rights commission. The police beat up women and children indiscriminately, alleged residents.																								According to police, trouble started on Monday night when drunken resident Goutam Haldar had a run-in with some cops on duty. When the policemen gave chase, Haldar mingled with a Tarakeswar-bound group. As the police tried to breach the procession and get to Goutam, a scuffle broke out.																								Then, some youths from the B.L. Saha Road-Rai Bahadur Road stretch started brickbatting the Sahapur police outpost, sparking a retaliatory lathicharge. Things took an ugly turn when a police team, led by officer-in-charge S. Das, allegedly went on the rampage, from around 11 pm, trying to track Goutam down.																								They entered every house and mercilessly beat us up, said Arati Bag, sporting a large bandage. Kanu, my little boy, was not spared. As I begged the policemen not to beat him up, they shoved me to the ground, alleged Bunty Dolui.																								Tuesday found residents, led by Trinamul Congress MLA Parash Dutta and former councillor Tarak Singh, staging demonstrations in front of the Sahapur police outpost. Several of the protesters were arrested. All shops remained shut in a mark of protest, even as a strong police picket and Rapid Action Force personnel maintained vigil.																								Deputy superintendent of police (town) Humayun Kabir said: Police had to resort to a lathicharge on Monday night to disperse the mob. We did not hurt anyone intentionally.

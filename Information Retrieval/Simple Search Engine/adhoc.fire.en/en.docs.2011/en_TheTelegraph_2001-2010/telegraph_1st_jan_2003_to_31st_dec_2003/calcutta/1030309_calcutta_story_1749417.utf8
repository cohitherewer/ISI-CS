 Sunday, March 09, 2003 				 Jilted wife surrenders after killing husband
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Driven by a desire for revenge, a woman brutally murdered her husband for renewing his relationship with his estranged first wife at Diamond Harbour, in South 24-Parganas, on Saturday. After killing the 28-year-old man, the woman dumped his body in a banana grove, possibly with help from others. 																								On Saturday morning, the woman surrendered to the Diamond Harbour police and confessed her guilt.																								After conducting preliminary investigations, police came to know that the victim Sahajul Paiks twin marriages led to the tragedy. Paik, a resident of Ghat Manisha village, married a woman of his locality four years ago. 																								Paik was a construction worker. A year ago, he fell in love with Taslima, one of his helpers who lived in nearby Lakshmipur village, said an official of Diamond Harbour police station. They signed the marriage registry papers in 2002. 																								But even after the marriage, Paik used to spend most of his time with his first wife. That made Taslima jealous, said the official.																								A few days ago, Taslima gave birth to a boy and since then Paik stopped talking to her. Despite her pleas, he also refused to hand over the marriage registry certificate, which he kept in his possession. 																								Police said Taslima met Paik on Friday evening when he was returning home from work. She managed to bring him to her house in Lakshmipur, said the official. After dinner, she gagged Paik and strangulated him.																								After killing the man, Taslima dumped the body in a banana grove, a few metres from her house. She has shown us the place, the official said.																								After examining the body, police concluded that Taslima could not have murdered her husband alone. Deb Kumar Ganguly, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said Taslima was being interrogated to find out the names of her aides.

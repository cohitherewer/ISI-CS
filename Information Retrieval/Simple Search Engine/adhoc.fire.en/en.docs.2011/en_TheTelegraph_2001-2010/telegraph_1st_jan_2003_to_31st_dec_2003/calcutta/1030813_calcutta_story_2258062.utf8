	The footpath of Strand Road, between Brabourne Road and  Fairlie Place, is quite narrow. It is really difficult for  pedestrians to walk along this kerb. Several shops on this  stretch stack their wares on the pavement. The civic body  must keep a check.

	My first trip to the Howrah Municipal Corporation office  recently, in connection with tax payment, was anything but  pleasant. The office building looked clean from the outside,  but it was a rude shock once I stepped inside. At the entrance,  lots of broken furniture and used tube lights were dumped.  Chunks of the roof have jutted out at many places and the  floor is dirty with puddles of water. Not to forget the  walls, which were damp and stained with spit. A coat of  dirt has gathered on old furniture and files, indicating  that these have not been dusted for months. The whole atmosphere  seemed unhealthy. How do we expect the corporation to keep  the town clean?

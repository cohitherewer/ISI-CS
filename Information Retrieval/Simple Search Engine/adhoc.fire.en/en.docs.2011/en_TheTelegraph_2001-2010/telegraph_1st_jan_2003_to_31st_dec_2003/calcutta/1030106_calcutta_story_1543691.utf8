He lived here when he was a budding singer and now he is here to perform on the occasion of completing 50 eventful years of his musical career. A natural talent with a mellifluous voice, Pandit Jasraj has trained musicians across the globe. He has even created a band of successful musicians including Kala Ramanath (violin). His daughter, Durga, herself a trained singer, who dabbled with films and television before taking up a career in event promotion three years ago, is organising this classical musical programme, titled Golden Voice, Golden Year. Other participants include: Kaushiki Chakraborty, Ustad Sultan Khan, Ustad Zakir Hussain and U. Srinivas.

																								Rajendra Gangani is a name to reckon with in the world of contemporary Kathak. This young talented dancer/choreographer has enriched this dance form by integrating the purity of the tradition with a contemporary touch. His dance has the superb blend of grace and vigour. He belongs to an illustrious family of legendary Kathak dancers. The torch-bearer of the Jaipur gharana of Kathak, he strives to preserve the distinctive classical form he inherited from his family. Rajendra was initiated to Kathak by his father, the great maestro Pandit Kundanlal Gangani. Recipient of several prestigious awards both in India and abroad, Rajendra has travelled extensively within the country and abroad, giving lecture-demonstrations. He is also an accomplished singer and musician who is equally apt at playing the tabla, harmonium and pakhawaj. He has also directed and composed music for all his solo and group compositions. This evening the Eastern Zonal Cultural Centre (EZCC) hosts a Kathak dance recital featuring Rajendra Gangani along with his troupe members and participants of a recently-concluded workshop conducted by him.

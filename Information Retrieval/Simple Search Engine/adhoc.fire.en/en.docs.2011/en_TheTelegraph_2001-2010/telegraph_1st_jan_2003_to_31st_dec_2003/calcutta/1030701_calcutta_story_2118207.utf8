 Siddhartha Sinha 																									But thats not all hes famous for. Debating, elocution, quizzing, sports, dramatics, writing Siddharthas got a finger in many a pie, with just one aim  to be the best.																									For this ICSE topper in St James, who then totted up 90-plus in every ISC subject. While at his books, he managed to scale the heights in both SAT I and SAT II. This set him on his way to Harvard University this year on a full scholarship to study economics.																									Is where Lotty loves to look. He is prouder of his out-of-class achievements. Cant really blame the captain of the school quizzing, debating, soccer and basketball teams, the school prefect, the founder member of Quizobean and chairman of the core committee organising the inter-school fest Jaco Synthesis. The Jacobean reporter also won the British Airways Essay Competition way back in Class VII. 																									Comes naturally to this trekking-freak who has clambered up to 14,000 feet in Dzongri, Sikkim, and also the Sterling Camp, in North Bengal. The roll of honour for this 18-year-old runs from leading his teams to victory to notching up individual triumphs; from being the best Sangeet Kala Mandir Quizzer for four years, to winning the most original concept for the one-act Pop Music, which he wrote, directed and acted in, at a British Council competition.																									Has our boy from Bhowanipore. The best debater in James also won the word war at the All India Chuckerbutty Memorial Debate at Doon School. He participated in three United Nations World Parliaments, emerging top in two, and second best in one. Of the 82 quizzes he took part in since Class V, awards poured in from 64, including the All India Limca Quiz, ESPN School Quiz Olympiad and Discovery Channel Quiz.																									Are Siddharthas lesser claims to fame including accolades at inter-school Western music competitions as the singer in the school band; being a member of the school table tennis, hockey and cricket teams; helping to organise functions like The Telegraph in School Awards and the Musical Talent Contest.

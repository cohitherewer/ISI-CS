 															- Cyber-cafe major ties up with leading hotels to offer club facilities to members A STAFF REPORTER				 	 CLUB CLASS: Chilling out after a hard days work																								Sweat it out in a state-of-the-art health club and take a dip in the pool. Surf the web before shaking a leg. Dial an astrologer to check out the stars and set out for a quiet holiday.																								We are offering everything that a couple needs in todays world, says Sushil Poddar, chairman, Happy Group of Industries. After setting up over 20 cyber-cafes under the brand name Happy eZon throughout the city, the group has hit town with a new concept, Happy Club.																								We are offering a host of services. These are not under one roof, but are bundled together to form a package that we are offering at an annual price of Rs 7,777, he explains. The club membership will be launched next week.																								The company has formally tied up with Hotel Hindustan International and Golden Park to offer health-club facilities and access to their discotheques, Winning Streak and London Pub, free of cost. MBD Airport Hotel is also on the partnership platter. Besides access to these funpoints, Happy Club members can enjoy unlimited surfing opportunity at every Happy e-Zon centre. Forecasts from astrologers and a horoscope on request will also be available to the members.																								We have tied up with some of the best hotels in Kathmandu, Goa, Jaipur and Puri. The package includes two nights and three days free stay at any of these hotels once a year, mentions Poddar. According to him, there is a need for such a package in the city, which is slowly catching up with the fast lifestyle of metros like Delhi and Mumbai.																								Our preliminary surveys have indicated that people want to have fun after a hard days work, but at a reasonable price. They also dont want to stick to one place and need variety. But in metros like Calcutta, getting a club membership is easier said than done and the rates are quite high at most of the entertainment centres, he adds.																								Corporate membership is being targeted as the cash cow segment, as companies will find it cheaper to provide total entertainment packages for their employees. Inquiries are pouring in and we expect to ramp up around 2,000 members in the first year alone, declares Poddar.																								The model  billed as the first of its kind in this part of the country  will be expanded to other metros shortly. We have initiated talks with hoteliers in Delhi to extend club facilities to our members. They are keen to join hands with us and will launch the brand after making it a success in Calcutta, sums up Poddar.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mystery surrounds the murder of a 29-year-old taxi driver, Anup Das, alias Sambhu. He was shot on Tuesday night near his Rani Rashmoni Garden Road residence, in the Tangra police station area, by unidentified assailants. He was moved to Nilratan Sirkar Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.																								Police said Das was cycling back home after parking his taxi at a nearby garage when he was intercepted by a few armed youths. An altercation followed, and Das was shot from point-blank range. He managed to cycle a short distance to meet his friends, Pintu Sarkar and Dipu Dey. They saw two men melt into the darkness. One of them called up the local police station, and officials reached the spot within 15 minutes, said Soumen Mitra deputy commissioner of police (detective department).																								When the police arrived, Das was on the road, writhing in pain. He had been shot in the stomach and was bleeding profusely. By the time he was taken to hospital, he had fainted due to the pain and blood loss. Doctors at the emergency ward put him on oxygen and saline immediately. He died within half an hour of being taken to hospital, an official of the local thana said.																								Das hailed from Nadia and had shifted to the city with his parents a few years ago. He had married a few months ago. 																								So far, we have not been able to find out the motive behind his murder. We are recording the statements of his relatives and neighbours to figure out what could have prompted the miscreants to kill him. We are also looking for an eyewitness who could give us a clue or describe the killers, said the official. 																								No major breakthrough was reported and no arrest made during the day. Das body has been sent for post-mortem.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Friday, June 06, 2003  Centre of action beyond city limits  - Mixed-use project to spur township progress An artists impression of the residential wing of City  Centre  The big boys of IT are setting  up shop here. The EM Bypass, Calcuttas fastest growing  spine, is at arms length. Phase I of New Town, Rajarhat,  is nearing completion. Still, Salt Lake is woefully short  of places to shop, relax, have a bite, go to a movie, or  simply hang out, feel most residents. City Centre, the 550,000-sq-ft  mixed-use project, scheduled to open up early next year,  will pitchfork this sleepy satellite township into the limelight,  acting as an anchor to spur allied infrastructure development  in Salt Lake, feel the developers. Like a magnet, it will draw visitors  from all over Calcutta, creating the need for development  in and around the area, says Harsh Neotia, director, Bengal  Ambuja Metro Development Ltd (BAMDL), the company building  the shopping-entertainment-residential project. Neotia feels City Centre will  give people enough reasons to come to Salt Lake, thus connecting  the township in a more integral sense to the rest of the  city. Charles Correa, for whom this is the first public  signature design in Calcutta, had recently spoken about  a possible shift in the citys centre of gravity once the  project is up and running. The developers are discussing  with the CMDA infrastructure requirements in the township,  in terms of public transport, roads, security arrangements  and the traffic it will generate. We are in dialogue with  the CMDA and it has given us the verbal go-ahead to beautify  and illuminate the areas around the perimeter, says Neotia. Residents are also upbeat about  City Centre, hoping that the Inox cineplex and a host of  dining and shopping options will transform the area into  a happening satellite city, like Gurgaon and Noida. During  evenings, there is often nothing to do in Salt Lake. City  Centre will add a dash of much-needed excitement to our  lives, says advocate Jnanendra Nath Banerjee, who lives  in the township. Apart from adding physical value  to the area through its architectural aesthetics and illumination,  the development is also expected to have a cascading effect  on transport linkages in Salt Lake. The central plaza will  replicate the romance of the traditional bazaar in a present-day  environment, comprising a long sequence of medium-sized  shops, stocking stuff ranging from the mundane to the exotic   a place to browse, bargain and buy. Small utility shops, like the  tailors or the hardware merchants, will cater to the neighbourhood,  alongside organised retailing, to create an interesting  energy of entrepreneurial skills. BAMDL officials are also  considering proposals to house outlets of the numerous small,  traditional eateries that dot the city. Shoppers Stop, the 57,000-sq-ft  anchor at City Centre, will be the garment chains largest  store in the country, according to officials, with brands  like Pizza Hut, Wrangler and Nike adding to the big-format  shopping experience. The developers are confident City  Centre will be a logistically-convenient middle-point for  the large catchment basin that stretches from Ultadanga  to beyond the airport and along the periphery of the Bypass.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
		 Wednesday, December 03, 2003  We Ask You Answer				 Cut shooting, let cars move
 Each week, Metro will ask its readers a question on current events. A selection of the responses will be published every Wednesday. Todays question: Should shooting be banned on city roads? More letters will be published next week wait n watch: Ajay Devgan waves at fans  gathered on College Street during the recent shooting  of Mani Rathnams film Yuva Dinabandhu Mukherjee,
																		Behala.																																																														It is true that shooting of films on city roads inconveniences pedestrian and vehicular traffic, not to mention the littering by the cast and crew. But to make films look real, sometimes shooting in natural surroundings is required. So, it cannot be banned altogether. Restrictions need to be imposed. Shooting should be allowed only on holidays. In exceptional cases, weekdays may be permitted, but prior notice should be issued to draw the attention of the public to the road restrictions. Adequate police personnel should be posted to control the crowd. A rubbish bin should also be provided. The Corporation may charge a nominal fee from the film unit.									

Sekhar Basu Mallik,
																		BB Chatterjee Road.																																																														Roads are meant for commuting. As long as the basics are provided, everything else may be permitted. Banning shooting of films per se is uncalled for. But, the area should be returned to its original condition after use. Otherwise, the user is liable to be punished or penalised. On the flip side, Calcuttans, who are well-known for going overboard with hero worship, if allowed, could have cleared some of the garbage left by the film stars, to collect as memorabilia.									

Sounak Chakraborty,
																		Baranagar.																																																														Yes, shooting of films should be banned on city roads. Calcutta is a very busy city, and more crowded than many others. Some time ago, at Sealdah, shooting was allowed at peak time, when the roads were blocked and onlookers had gathered. As a result, the traffic moved at a snails pace, and office-goers, school students and patients suffered. Film shootings cannot disturb or hamper our daily lives. The government and the police should take adequate measures to prevent disruption.									

Roshni Sengupta,
																		Khanpur Road.																																																														Everyone, from school students to office-goers and labourers, has to suffer the bad road conditions in this city. An award-winning film director, with his crew and the hottest stars in show business, is enough to throw traffic completely out of gear. Since there are no outlets to make way for the traffic, shooting on city roads should be banned.									

Diptimoy Ghosh, 
																		Salt Lake City.																																																														No, certainly not. If it is banned on city roads then how can streetlife be projected? Shooting of films on city roads may create a lot of trouble for commuters. That does not mean that shooting should be stopped outdoor. But for the sake of students, office-goers and patients, the traffic should not become a mess. Police should take all possible precautionary measures in advance so that some portion of the carriageway is kept free. 									

Prahlad Agarwala, 
																		Majdia, Nadia.																																																														Definitely. Since star-crazed onlookers crowd a spot, bringing movement of traffic to a standstill during shooting of films on city roads, permission should not be granted to producers in the greater interest of the public. But it can be allowed in the dead of night. 									

Naren Sen, 
																		Santragachhi. 																																																														Shooting of films on thoroughfares should not be banned. A sequence might require a specific location. The project will have to be cancelled unless permission is given. But during peak hours, shooting of films should not be allowed. Otherwise, this will cause traffic snarls or accidents. Recently, Mani Rathnams film was shot in the city. It was an exciting experience for the common people. 									

Saadia Sitwat, 
																		Linton Street. 																																																														Absolutely. Shooting should be banned on roads. There is no sense in making hundreds of people wait, caught in a traffic jam, while the film unit goes about its work with a curious crowd blocking the roads trying to get a glimpse of the stars and policemen trying frantically to manage them as well as protect the stars. 									

Asif Nadeem, 
																		Serampore. 																																																														Why should shooting not be allowed on city roads? If shooting is held after taking the required permission, then there should not be any hindrances. If we raise objection to shooting of our films on the roads, then how can we expect foreign countries to cooperate when our actors and directors travel abroad? 									

Mahasweta Saha, 
																		Garia.																																																														Shooting of films on city roads is not at all new. But while shooting, the production company should keep in mind that its work does not hamper traffic flow. Recently, during the shooting of a film by Mani Rathnam, plates, cups, polythene bags etc. used by the unit members, were dumped on Vidyasagar Setu. Its true that the production company was paying Rs 5,000 per hour but that does not mean that it could get away with uncivic practices. Shootings on city roads must not be banned, but the authorities concerned and the film companies must be responsible enough to keep the city roads clean and free of traffic jam during shootings. 									

Satyen Biswas,
																		Behala.																																																														Shooting on the roads is not a good idea. It creates traffic jams in a congested city like Calcutta. People gather to see the stars. This calls for security arrangements. There may even be an accident.									

Susanta Kumar Bedajna, 
																		KB Sarani.																																																														No. Rather, shooting of films should be done on holidays with advance notice to the police station concerned. Otherwise, the real look will be missing in films. Commuters may have to bear with the inconvenience for a short while. But even funeral processions hold up traffic. 									

Sarit Kumar Datta. 
																		Address not given. 																																																														We, Bengalis, with our intellectual credentials  our cultural consciousness, political awareness and accommodative liberalism  should not say no to shooting of films on city roads. We cant let go of the chance to let our grand old city be seen by people across the country.

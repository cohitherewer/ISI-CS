  Easy entry: How secure is the airport  complex? I have a different experience  with the West Bengal Medical Council (WBMC) than what its  officials claim in the report Set a doctor to net a thief  (Metro, June 16).  My daughter, a doctor herself, had lodged a complaint against the treating doctor, in June 1994, for causing death of her mother through negligence and wrong treatment. Her complaint contained the detailed case history as well as medical evidence. WBMC took over six years to just respond, rubbishing her complaint.  Interestingly, I had also sued the same doctor for the same offence before the State Consumer Grievance Redressal Commission in November 1994. The Commission, a legal forum, scrutinised the same evidences, heard depositions of specialists and cross-examined the doctor, where he did admit, albeit indirectly, his faulty treatment. The Commission, on February 3, 1997, held the doctor guilty and imposed a penalty on him. The doctor went on to appeal to the National Commission, but was compelled to shell out Rs 1 lakh.  When all our efforts to fix the erring doctor professionally by the WBMC failed, we approached the health minister, on February 14, 2001, who, after going through the case file, decided on a fresh inquiry. The state health department on October 3, 2001, asked the WBMC to act accordingly. The departments deadline to start the probe expired on August 31, 2002. The council maintains its stony silence to date.  Further, the WBMC president says he is happy that more and more people are approaching us seeking redress against doctors. Is he not aware that as per Bengal Medical Act, 1914, the council alone can punish a doctor for an infamous (i.e. negligent and wrong treatment) act by way of suspension /cancellation of his registration? The aggrieved citizens are left with no other alternative but to move court, which can only impose financial penalty but not punish where it hurts the most  loss of registration.  Ajit Chattopadhyay,
 Gariahat Road South.  One wonders how Bangladeshis could occupy the deserted airport staff quarters inside the airport. This is highly dangerous from the security angle. Kudos for highlighting about it in Airport staff quarters host encroachers in Metro on June 16. A thorough inquiry must be made as to how unauthorised people could occupy the vacant staff quarters.  The AAI and CISF personnel should be more vigilant as the airport is a high security area. Blaming each other is not the solution.  B.N. Bose, 
 Dum Dum.  Apropos the report Three women as sari saviours (Metro, June 19), we are overwhelmed at the humane and valiant quick-witted action of the three women. One of them did not even hesitate to take off her sari without caring the least for her modesty. The sari proved a lifeline for the eight-year-old boy who fell in the Nandan tank and was pulled out with the sari. We cant find enough words to praise them. But the authorities should make sure that there is no repeat of the accident by building high railings around the tank.  Sunil Banerjee, 
 VIP Road.  This is distressing to learn that people of Howrah are suffering from gastro-enteritis and other water-borne diseases due to consumption of contaminated drinking water over the years. This is criminal negligence by the Howrah civic authorities (Civic silence as killer water count climbs, Metro, June 17). The need of the hour is immediate repairs of the water line and preventing slum-dwellers from drilling holes in them.  Mohan Lal Sarkar, 
 Budge Budge.  It was horrible to read about the cat which was brutally tortured when it sneaked inside the courtroom (Cat caught in court thrashed, Metro, June 20). The cruel employees who tormented the cat for fun should be punished!  Aparajita Dasgupta,
 Jadavpur.  How two-faced can the city police force be? A few months ago, Bapi Sen, a sergeant of Calcutta Police, laid down his life protecting a woman from drunken cops. Now another sergeant has been caught almost red-handed while trying to snatch a gold chain from a businessman (Sergeant snared in chain snatch, Metro, June 14).  Prahlad Agarwala, 
 Majdia, Nadia.  The report about the dismissal of a case of medical negligence by Calcutta High Court carried erroneous information (HC dismisses doctor case, Metro, June 19). It was stated that the People United for Better Treatment filed a petition against a doctor. First, it should be People for Better Treatment (PBT). Second, it was Mihir Banerjee, whose 12-year-old daughter allegedly died from wrong therapy, and not the PBT, who filed the petition.  Kunal Saha,
 President, PBT, Ohio, USA.

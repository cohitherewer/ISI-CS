The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Wednesday, December 31, 2003  A whole new year
 - We saw it, so we believe it  Calcutta, it is achanging. High  time, most would say. On the last day of the year, we look  back with a smile at some of the real changes the city was  witness to in 2003. Surely, theres more in store in  2004 Flyover fancy  The unmissable infrastructural  value addition to the cityscape. All of 2.5 km long, built  at a cost of Rs 177.73 crore, the AJC Bose Road flyover  took more than two years to build  from March 15, 2001  to August 19, 2003  and the roads below have resembled  a holocaust zone. But no one really minds anymore, now that  you can zip, zap, zoom over a congested stretch of Calcutta.  But the bottlenecks at the two ends remain a downer. And on the ground, jaywalkers  were stopped, censured and slapped fines in a bid to speed  up traffic and curb accidents. Business buzz The Bengal government meant business,  with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee leading from the front  on  the Maidan (Infocom 2003) and in Mumbai (roadshow debut)   to woo investment.  Bengal moved up to second rung  on the state ladder for domestic investment. That was made  possible by the manufacturing industry, but IT remains the  focus for the future and Wipro the biggest name that committed  to Calcutta this year.  Sector V in Salt Lake generated  more than 5,000 new jobs, with IBM, CTS and TCS showing  the way. Talk amp; travel The cellphone reigned supreme  as the years communication tool. The mobile count crossed  the 10 lakh mark  close on the heels of landlines, pegged  at around 13.5 lakh  and the SMS was closer to countless.  A spurt in international airlines  and domestic flights helped Calcutta hop, skip and jump.  The tarmac competed with the tracks  as the apex fares caught on. At Howrah station, closed for  the first time for two days in September, the Rs 3.25-crore  route-relay interlocking system meant to increase capacity  groaned to a start. Rally row An effort by Justice Amitava Lala  to restrict weekday rallies for the benefit of the Calcutta  commuter struck a chord, before the matter was mired in  administrative and judicial jousting. But for the few days  in October when rally raj was curbed, the wheels turned  far smoother and theres hope yet for the lights turning  red for traffic-stopper processions.  The high court, however, laid  down the law when it came to giving the Maidan a breather  (no fairs, please) and the city air a chance (Bharat Stage  II a must). The effects should show next year. Health at hand Southern comfort came to Calcuttas  sick-bedside as two healthcare heavyweights set up hubs  here. Apollo Gleneagles Hospitals  the 325-bed multi-speciality  centre on the EM Bypass with round-the-clock emergency care,  a fleet of ambulances linked to a national emergency network,  a 72-bed ICU and more  has raised the healthcare bar in  town, along with the Rotary Narayana Sankara Nethralayas  cutting-edge ophthalmic care centre. And Bhagirathi Neotia  Woman amp; Child Care Centre inaugurated a comprehensive  neonatal intensive care unit. In keeping with the global trend  of wellness, the first holistic medical spa in this part  of the country Sanjeeva Spa opened its doors in Vedic Village.  A boost to rejuvenation and health tourism. Sight amp; sound Aishwarya Rai spending hours in  a Tollygunge mud hut, Kareena Kapoor taking tram rides,  Rani Mukherjee having a ball on the Maidan and Raveena Tandon  getting into Bengali bridal finery weeks before her marriage  2003 was as beautiful as it gets. Showbiz went reel big,  with Mani Rathnam and his boys  Ajay Devgan, Vivek Oberoi  (of the broken leg on our bridge) and Abhishek Bachchan   taking over the city streets. If Mr amp; Mrs Iyer,  Chokher Bali and Abar Aranye shared silver-screen  attention, on stage it was A.R. Rahman at Salt Lake Stadium  who made just the right sounds. While on sound, Calcutta  tuned into FM power, with 24-hour music on four channels. Fun amp; food Forum, the 200,000-sq ft lifestyle  mall on Elgin Road was the hangout address of the year.  Anchored by Shoppers Stop and fired by INOX, it is changing  the way the city shops, sips, bites and goes to the movies.  The citys first multiplex, shelves overflowing with the  branded stuff and popular food points saw Forum clocking  a 20,000-plus footfall on Christmas. The food trail was piping hot,  with quite a few eating-house entrants and a couple of comebacks,  too.  Blue Fox reopened in a brand new  Middle East-cuisine avatar and Waldorf shifted to Russell  Street after the Park Street shutdown. Enjoying pride of  place among the new was Oh Calcutta!  Others worth mention and meal  included Copper Chimney, Starstruck and the hookah bar in  Grain of Salt.  The corner-cafe culture caught  on like never before with hours spent at the Caf Coffee  Days, Baristas and Aqua Javas.

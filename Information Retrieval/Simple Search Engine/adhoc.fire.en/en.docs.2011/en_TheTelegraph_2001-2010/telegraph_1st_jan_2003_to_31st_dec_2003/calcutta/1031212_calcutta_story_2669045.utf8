The Telegraph - Calcutta : Metro
 Friday, December 12, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	The Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) is laying new tramlines  between Gariahat and Park Circus. I fail to understand why  such a large amount is being spent on such a project when  the CTC is running at a huge loss. Besides, trams, unlike  buses and minibuses, do not have too many commuters even  during the rush hours. So, what is the justification of  this expenditure? The government should not make it just  a ploy to keep the ruling partys vote bank intact.

	The footpaths opposite the Phari bus stop in Salt Lake  are in a very bad state. A couple of months ago, the state  electricity board had dug up the kerbs to lay cables. But,  as usual, the pits are yet to be filled up. Several residents,  especially the elderly, have slipped off the uneven road  surface and hurt themselves. Moreover, pedestrians are often  left with no option but to walk along the busy carriageway  with traffic hurtling by.

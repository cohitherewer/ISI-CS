 Friday, September 05, 2003 				 Brawl over passenger kills one
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A brawl between two rickshaw-pullers over sharing of passengers on Khagen Chatterjee Road, in the Chitpur police station area, proved fatal for one of them on Thursday afternoon. Asraf Ali, alias Kanaiah, 20, died after being hit on the forehead by Bhola Laskar, 36, at the Khagen Chatterjee Road rickshaw stand.																								At around 2 in the afternoon, two persons called out for a rickshaw at the stand and both Kanaiah and Bhola approached them. An altercation broke out between the two over who was first in line at the stand. 																								After a few minutes of heated argument, the duo got into a scuffle, during which Bhola landed a blow on Kanaiahs forehead. The youth slumped to the ground, said an officer of Chitpur police station. 																								While Bhola geared up for a fresh assault, several bystanders who had since been watching the fight along with other rickshaw-pullers rushed to stop him. Kanaiah did not respond even after we sprinkled water on his face. We took him to RG Kar Hospital. He succumbed to his injury within a few minutes, said a witness.																								Bhola fled the spot immediately after the incident, leaving behind his vehicle. He seems to have gone into hiding, said Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of police (detective department). Civic showcause																								The Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has showcaused chief municipal health officer (CMOH) Sujit Ghosh, public analyst Shankar Debnath and food inspector of the Taratala area Subrata Bose for allegedly giving a clean chit to the Coca Cola bottling plant at Taratala on the quality of its soft drinks. 																								The decision was taken after an emergency mayor-in-council meeting on Thursday. Preliminary investigation revealed that the CMOHs rubber-stamp had been misused during his leave since July 8. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said the showcause was part of the legal procedure the CMC intended to take against the company.

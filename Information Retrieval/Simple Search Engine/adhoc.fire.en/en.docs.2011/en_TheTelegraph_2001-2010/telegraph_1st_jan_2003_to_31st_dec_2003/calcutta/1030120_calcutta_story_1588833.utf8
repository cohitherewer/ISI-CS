 Monday, January 20, 2003 				 Arrests for murder spark roadblock
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Residents and members of a local club in Thakurpukur set up an hour-long roadblock on M.G. Road on Sunday morning, protesting the arrest of three persons in connection with a murder in the area. The victim was a supplier of building materials and a Trinamul Congress activist, identified as Sujit Mukherjee, alias Kuche.																								All shops and the local market were closed as a mark of protest. The agitators also demanded the arrest of the real culprits. Mukherjee, 32, was murdered while on his way home after downing his shop shutters near Harisabha More, at Banerjee Para, around 10.30 pm on Saturday. The assailants shot him from close range, taking advantage of the dark winter night. He was taken to M.R.Bangur Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. 																								Deputy superintendent of police (town) Subhankar Chatterjee said Mukherjee had disputes with rivals in the trade, which may have led to his murder. We have picked up three persons and one of them, identified as Bhola, was named in the FIR. Now, we are looking for the brain behind the murder. 																								On Sunday, as news of the arrests spread, local people and members of a club patronised by Mukherjee hit the road, alleging that the police had arrested innocent persons for the murder. Bulu Sen, a neighbour, said Mukherjee was an amiable man and kept himself busy with social work. The roadblock and an attempt to bring out a protest demonstration was withdrawn after the local police intervened.

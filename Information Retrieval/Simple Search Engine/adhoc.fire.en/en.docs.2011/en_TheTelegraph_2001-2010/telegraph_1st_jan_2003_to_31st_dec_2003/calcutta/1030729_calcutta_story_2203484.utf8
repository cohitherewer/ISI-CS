		 Tuesday, July 29, 2003  Star Spot
 Vikash Kumar Baid																									And in his pen lies his power. The Star Tiger of 2003 was what The Telegraph in Schools called Vikash, whose journalistic skills are proved by the illustrious list of celebrities he has interviewed over the past two years.																									Are likely to find this Don Bosco Liluah pass-out, who is currently running around for admissions to a B.Com course in city colleges, in the limelight. He has received word from Penguin Indias Delhi office that some poems he sent in for consideration are to be published in a collection some time soon. The guy, who writes English poetry in his free time, has also participated in a competition organised by Poetry.com and sends in some of his work to city newspapers.																									Coz Vikash dreams of being nothing less than a media baron. Take a look at some of those he has cornered for his stories: Sachin Tendulkar, Virendra Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh from the cricket pitch; Madhuri Dixit, Aishwarya Rai, Karisma Kapoor from filmdom; Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, Ayaan Ali Bangash, Ehsaan and Loy from the world of music, writer Taslima Nasreen and Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. He has also been taking up a few freelance assignment for a UK-based publishing house called Real Tales.																									In the arena of rights is also something Vikash stands by. The animal rights activist works with People for Ethical Treatment of Animals. He organises camps and writes articles for the organisation as part of its campaigns and even spreads the word through schools. He has participated in the youth initiatives taken by Sanlaap, a city-based NGO working against trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. He has also spent time with the kids at Don Bosco Ashalayam and with the platform children at Howrah.																									Sees the creative head of the school dramatics club on stage.

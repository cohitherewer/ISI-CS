The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, October 08, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	Every now and then, either the CESC or Calcutta Telephones  dig roads to lay cables, taking little care of the drainage  system. Despite several warnings, they have damaged my underground  sewerage pipe. I ask the authorities of both companies to  replace my damaged pipes at the earliest.

	My 89-year-old aunt, who was a schoolteacher, has been  receiving pension since retirement. In 1995, she took to  bed. Her pension receipts got disrupted due to our fault.  Her pension was resumed from 2001, without the arrears and  the upward revision. Last month, I approached the Pension  Cell for Education at AG (Bengal). I was in for a pleasant  surprise. The officials were kind and helpful. She received  a cheque, including all arrears, within a week of approaching  them. I want to thank the pension cell for the prompt service.  Its reputation is tarred by a handful of rogue officials.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, October 13, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	I was pleasantly surprised to find Calcutta Municipal Corporation  men draining out stagnant water from Lower Rawdon Street  with a suction pump a few days ago, when heavy showers lashed  the city. Earlier, the manholes would be opened to drain  the water out. Since this area is very low, water accumulates  on the street very easily. Communication poses a problem,  especially with rickshaws charging high rates. 
	 S.S. Almal, Lower Rawdon Street.  
	The two bus termini at Howrah station need immediate repairs.  Both the stands become slushy and unfit for walking even  after a mild shower. 
	 Naren Sen, Ramrajtala.

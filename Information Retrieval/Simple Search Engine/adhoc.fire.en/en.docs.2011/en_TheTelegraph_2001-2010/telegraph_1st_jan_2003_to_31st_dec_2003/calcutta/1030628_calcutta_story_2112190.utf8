																																																		The days of grumbling over taxi-meter fixing could soon be over. The state government is poised to make it mandatory for taxi-owners to get their meters cleared by a tech tool it is importing, prior to permit renewal. The computerised machines will be used to check the efficacy of taxi meters in order to eliminate tampering, state transport minister Subhas Chakraborty at Writers Buildings on Friday. The taxis will be driven on to a bay with machines underneath that can rotate the wheels for a pre-fixed time. Six such machines will be imported. The transport department will also launch a drive from July to fine vehicles without permits in Calcutta and on its outskirts. We also plan to increase inter-state bus services, Chakraborty added.																																																		A fire broke out on the ground floor of Stephen House at BBD Bag, at around 12.15 pm on Friday. The offices housed in the building were immediately evacuated. It took three fire-tenders about an hour to put out the blaze. CESC workers were called in and the power supply to the building was cut off. People who work on the premises alleged that the electricity wiring lacked maintenance and this was the second fire in the past year. 																																																		A 55-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday by the fourth additional district judge, Barasat court, Anup Chowdhury for having raped and murdered an eight-year-old girl two years ago.

The murder took place on August 24, 2001, at the house of Chowdhury, in the airport police station area, where the victim, Priyanka, used to stay with her mother. Chowdhury allegedly attacked her while her mother was away. The girl lost consciousness, and Chowdhury, believing her to be dead, called for his daughter, Sikha.

The girls mother lodged a complaint with the police. Later, police picked up Chowdhury.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, August 29, 2003  Words that weather time
 The lyrical lilt of Urdu and the strains  of sarod and esraj melded in Samir Mukerjees youth  to leave lasting impressions of the men who introduced them  to his life Moinuddin Rahi is a tall  and gangling man with an undistinguished appearance. His  life-long devotion to Urdu gives his personality an upward  tilt. He taught Urdu and Persian to the children and grandchildren  of upper-class Muslim families. His regular and intimate  contacts with these families expanded his vistas and he  became familiar with the contours of a refined and rarefied  world. Rahi sahab was sent to  me by a friend of mine to give an impetus to my Urdu conversation  that had become one of my major obsessions. For years I  have been trying to speak in Urdu with my Muslim friends  but the efforts were halting and perfunctory. Rahi sahabs  arrival and almost instant rapport with me fulfilled a need  that was withering for lack of nourishment. He made me speak  in Urdu for hours on end without falling back on a single  English word. We chose our topics and the conversation began  after that on a highly animated note. Initially, I stuttered  and stumbled and felt as if I was drowning in a river with  treacherous currents. My teachers patience was illimitable.  He waited for me to find the right word to express myself  adequately. How marvellously he bolstered my confidence,  presenting me with exciting new words and phrases to add  to my vocabulary. Rahi sahab was an incurable  romantic and nothing pleased him more than to talk about  love and its various manifestations. His histrionic ability  came to the fore when he demonstrated the movements of women  in different moods. He was superb when he showed a woman  approaching her lover in a state of intoxication or a young  woman afflicted by the pangs of unrequited passion. A girl  wearing anklets and adorning herself for her tryst with  her lover was acted out with the right touches. It could  have been Kelucharan Mahapatra displaying the various bhavas  through his immaculate abhinay.  It is this vivacity on Rahi sahabs  part that made him such an admirable teacher. There was  not a single drab moment with him as his sparkling eyes,  chuckles and body language contributed to a sumptuous fare.  All this was accomplished with suitable quotations and a  procession of ornate words that shone like diamonds. Rahi sahab was in some  ways a Sufi by nature for whom a dogmatic approach and rigid  orthodoxy were almost criminal offences. He often emphasised  that Gods majesty could be savoured in the changing colours  of the sky and heady aromas of flowers blooming at night.  The resurgence of fundamentalism in both camps is a constant  source of irritation to him and he gropes for solutions  in his own way. His popularity amongst his students  has remained undimmed over the years. He teaches Urdu at  Bapu Intermediate College in UP and I gathered from him  when we met last time that students often came to his house  in droves. His homespun philosophy, with simplicity as its  hallmark, helped him sail through life even when circumstances  were adverse. Rahi was drawn to me by the fact  that as a Bengali I was desperately keen to speak Urdu fluently  and I had kept my love for Urdu alive for years and years.  Urdu poetry acquired a momentum on Rahis lips and the sounds  and scents of another world entranced me by their novelty.  Im reminded of the under-noted lines which had reverberations  of their own when Rahi sahab used to recite them  for my delectation. Donon jahan teri mohabbat  mein haar ke Woh ja raha hai koi shab-e-gham  guzaar ke Veeraan hai maikada khum-o-sagar  udaas hain Tum kya gaye ke rooth gaye  din bahaar ke. (Having lost both the worlds in  your love There goes a lonely man spending  a night of grief. The tavern lies deserted, the  cups have been abandoned With your departure spring has  turned away) I couldnt have come across a  more scintillating and pain-staking Urdu teacher who introduced  me to the beauty of a language that could enlarge the heart  and kindle my imagination. Steeped in old-world courtesies  and quivering with emotion, Rahi sahabs entry into  my life was an unqualified blessing. Amongst my fathers brothers,  my youngest uncle, Dr Bhupendra Nath Mukherjee, better known  as Gama, was somehow more interesting than the run-of-the-mill,  conventional types we normally come across. Quick-witted,  eloquent and intellectually agile, Gamakaka could  never be labelled or slotted and confined to a narrow space.  He went to London for higher studies before World War II  but got trapped by the long duration of the conflict. He  stayed in the students hostel at 112, Gower Street while  London was being ravaged by German bombs. I remember meeting him in London  in 1948 when he looked terribly English with his cloth cap  and curved pipe. He had a large circle of friends amongst  the British intellectuals and one often hears the names  of Richard Crossman, G.D.H. Cole and Dennis Stoll (whose  father Sir Oswald Stoll founded a famous theatre in London).  Dennis came out to Calcutta to stay with Gamakaka  and went about in proper Indian garb as if he was used to  it. My uncle knew Krishna Menon extremely well and I can  imagine their animated conversation whenever they met. My uncle had an aptitude for music  from an early age and he tried his hand at various instruments.  He played the sarod and tabla with expertise and went over  to the esraj and flute later on. After returning home from  England in the mid-40s, he gave learned discourses on the  radio on Indian classical music. These talks were extremely  popular. When the dancer Ramgopal went to London after the  War, Gamakaka accompanied him as his impresario.  The world of music kept him pleasantly occupied. He took a lunge at law while he  was in England and became a barrister. He practised in Calcutta  High Court for a while but joined Calcutta Law College as  its vice-principal sometime later. Just before this, he had a short  stint at the Calcutta Corporation as its chief law officer.  He was appalled by the messiness of this organisation that  was nothing short of a den of iniquity. He felt totally  defeated by a deadly combination of inertia and malpractice.  Has anything changed in all these years?

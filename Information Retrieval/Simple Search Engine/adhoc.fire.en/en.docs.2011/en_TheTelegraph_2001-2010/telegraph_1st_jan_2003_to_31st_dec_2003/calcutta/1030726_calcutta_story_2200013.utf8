 Saturday, July 26, 2003 				 Carpark risk to Writers: Trinamul
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The multi-storeyed car park proposed beside Laldighi, opposite Writers Buildings, was the target of Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress in the Assembly on Friday. Trinamul legislature party chief Pankaj Banerjee, Tapas Roy and several other party legislators came together to raise questions and unsuccessfully force the government to disclose the financial and operational details of the project, estimated to cost Rs 15 crore.																								Public Works Department minister Amar Chowdhury told the Assembly that the government had kept open the option of tying up with a private party and setting up the project. If necessary, we will go for a joint venture with any private promoter, Chowdhury said.																								The bid offers received in response to the tender, floated some time ago, inviting proposals for execution of the job, will be opened shortly. The government informed Abdul Mannan of the Congress that the fully-mechanised parking lot will house 726 vehicles. Government departments will be allotted space for 400 cars. The rest of the slots will be used to park private cars on payment of charges. The lot will consist of four floors, of which two will be used for parking cars.																								Trinamuls Tapas Roy opposed the construction of the complex opposite Writers. The area is a high-security zone, he said. The PWD minister rejected his contention and said there was no security threat in constructing the complex. Parking is a problem in the area and we are concerned about that, he added.																								Pankaj Banerjee asked whether the government had floated a global tender for the job. He was told there was no need for a global tender as our engineers are competent enough to carry out such construction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, January 14, 2003 				 Road rules hit Calcutta dead-end
 A STAFF REPORTER Fatal flaws
 Pedestrians  dont wait for the signal while crossing Pedestrians  dont use zebra crossings Pedestrians  jaywalk Drivers move  out of their own lanes Drivers (of  buses) overtake and stop in the middle of the  road for passengers Drivers overtake  from the left Are Calcuttans the worst when  it comes to following road rules? Calcutta Police commissioner  Sujoy Chakraborty sure thinks so. And three accidents on Monday  within a few kilometres of Rabindra Sadan, where Chakraborty  was inaugurating a road-safety week, bore grim testimony  to this dubious distinction. Educated people in Calcutta seem  to have a mental block when it comes to one aspect of their  learning  basic traffic rules, said Chakraborty, singling  out this one trait that distinguishes Calcuttans from  residents of other cities. The pedestrian scampering across  the road with one hand raised above his head and missing  the speeding vehicle by a whisker was one sight no other  city could boast of, observed the police chief. Outside Rabindra Sadan, Calcuttans  were busy proving Chakraborty right, with tragic consequences.  The first mishap occurred on Tollygunge Circular Road. A  yet-to-be-identified cyclist tried to cut across the busy  road but ended up under the wheels of a speeding bus. The  cyclist died at MR Bangur Hospital, the bus was impounded  but the driver fled the accident site. The second accident on the first  day of the road-safety week occurred on BT Road when 14-year-old  Sayanti Das, on her way to Sashimukhi Balika Vidyalaya,  was crushed by an oil tanker. The vehicle was impounded,  but the driver managed to flee. The third mishap, fortunately,  did not prove fatal, as the driver of a luxury coach rammed  into a lamppost not far from Howrah station, sending three  Ganga Sagar pilgrims to hospital. How can things be set right? One  answer, feels Chakraborty, lies in peoples participation.  It is a mistake to say that the traffic department of Calcutta  Police (organisers of the week-long awareness drive) controls  traffic in Calcutta. It is done by Calcuttans themselves,  he said. And so, the strategy of children  steering the road-safety drive. Going through the humiliation  of being reprimanded by someone his daughters age, in public  view, is something that even a Calcuttan tends not to forget  in a hurry, quipped the police chief. At the Rabindra Sadan function,  police officers unveiled traffic-management plans for the  future and screened films documenting two recent incidents  highlighting the tragedy of such mishaps  one of them revolved  round thalassaemia patient Bappaditya Haldar, who bled to  death on Amherst Street, sparking the suicide of three family  members. The final frame, however, was  reserved for sergeant Bapi Sen, whose death was caused on  the streets of Calcutta not by accident but by a deliberate  and diabolical act.

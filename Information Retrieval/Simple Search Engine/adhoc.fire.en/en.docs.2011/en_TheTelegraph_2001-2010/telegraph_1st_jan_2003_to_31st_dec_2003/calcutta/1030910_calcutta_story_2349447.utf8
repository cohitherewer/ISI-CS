 Wednesday, September 10, 2003 				 Saha files fresh plea for licence block
 OUR LEGAL REPORTER																								US-based doctor Kunal Saha filed a fresh case in Calcutta High Court on Tuesday, calling for the cancellation of medical licences of the two doctors convicted of his wife Anuradhas death.																								Saha, who has been fighting a protracted medical negligence case against three city physicians who treated Anuradha at a private hospital, demanded an interim cancellation of the licences of Sukumar Mukherjee and Baidyanath Haldar. The two doctors had been convicted by a trial court. 																								On May 29, 2002, the chief judicial magistrate of Alipore court convicted the two doctors in the Anuradha Saha death case, sentencing them to three months rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs 3,000 each. 																								Sahas petition came up for hearing before Justice Pinaki Ghose, but the matter could not proceed as the copy of the petition has not yet been served to one of the physicians. The case is scheduled to come up for hearing on Wednesday. 																								The Medical Council of India Act, 1956 is aimed at protecting the Indian patients from errant doctors and at regulating the professional ethics and conduct, negligence and malpractice of the physicians, the petitioner stressed.																								Saha demanded court intervention to ensure that once a court of law had found doctors guilty of the charges brought against them, their names should be struck from the register of the medical council.																								Meanwhile, appeals filed by the accused doctors and Kunal Saha against the judgment of the trial court are being heard by Justice G.C. De of Calcutta High Court. While Saha is calling for more severe punishment for the doctors, the accused are seeking an order quashing the trial court verdict. Saha has also appealed for punishment of the third doctor, Abani Roy Chowdhury, who he had accused in the case. Roy Chowdhury had been acquitted by the trial court.

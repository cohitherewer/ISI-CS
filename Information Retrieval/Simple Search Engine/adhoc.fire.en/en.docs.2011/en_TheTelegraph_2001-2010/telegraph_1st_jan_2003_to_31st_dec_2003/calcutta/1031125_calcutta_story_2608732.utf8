 Tuesday, November 25, 2003 				 New house repair form
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee announced on Monday the introduction of a form in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation that a house-owner will have to fill before carrying out repairs. 																								Though no formal permission is required from the civic bodys building department for carrying out repairs, house-owners are often misled by touts. The new form will break their stranglehold, the mayor said.																								A house-owner is required only to fill in the form and get a permitted stamp on it for repairing his home. The service will be provided across the table and a civic employee will be slapped with a showcause notice if he sits on a form duly filled in and submitted by a house-owner.																								It will be the house-owners responsibility, however, to restrict the repairs to the norms specified in the form.

																																																																																		Justice Barin Ghosh of Calcutta High Court came down heavily on a private firm on Wednesday, for pilfering power from the CESC. The company, Prakash Ceramics, had filed a petition before the high court after the CESC allegedly caught its rolling mill at Liluah, in Howrah, in the act of pilfering power. The CESC had slapped a fine of Rs 15 lakh on the company. In the petition, the company urged the court to direct the CESC to revise the bill. Rejecting the prayer, the high court directed the company to directly approach the CESC with its appeal for a downward revision of the bill. Justice Ghosh said he would hear the petition on a later date.

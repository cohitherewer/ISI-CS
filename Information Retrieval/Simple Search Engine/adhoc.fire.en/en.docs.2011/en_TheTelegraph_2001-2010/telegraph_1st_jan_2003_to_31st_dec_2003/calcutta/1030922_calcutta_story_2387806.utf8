 Monday, September 22, 2003 				 Flyover work drills hole in water mains
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Filtered water supply in the Park Street-AJC Bose Road belt was severely affected on Sunday, following a breach in the 12-inch diameter mains caused by piling work by contractors working on the Park Street flyover project.																								The affected areas included Park Street, Kyd Street, Free School Street, Wood Street, Short Street, Camac Street and Middleton Row.																								It is the second time that the water supply distribution network has been hit by the flyover contractors. Last year, they caused similar damage to our water mains at the Kyd Street point, said member, mayor-in-council, water supply, Sovan Chatterjee.																								Civic engineers repaired the the breach in 10 hours and supply was restored towards the evening.																								The southern part of the city is likely to face less pressure in the water supply on Monday because of the shutting down of the Garden Reach Waterworks.

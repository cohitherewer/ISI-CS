 SANJAY MANDAL																								Unable to curb illegal use of land and the changing of building plans without permission, the Salt Lake authorities have drawn up a plan to firmly deal with those violating rules. The first target is a car showroom in BA block of the township. Officers of Bidhannagar Municipality alleged that the showroom did not have a trade licence.																								We are investigating the case of the car showroom. We shall initiate appropriate action according to the law against the showroom-owners, asserted Dilip Gupta, chairman of Salt Lake municipality, on Saturday. Legal action will be initiated soon. 																								We have received reports that the owners of the showroom do not have a trade licence and the civic body did not raise any objection, he said.																								The showroom became embroiled in a controversy last October when the municipality sent a team and asked the owners to shut down the shop and remove the company signboard on the day of its inauguration. They claimed that it was closed.																								Municipality officers said although illegal use of plots is prevalent in Salt Lake, often, the civic body finds itself in helpless situations. Lack of infrastructure is a major handicap. But there are other problems, too, Dilip Gupta said. In many cases, when we try to initiate action, the offenders take recourse to law and we have to wait till the court verdict, he explained. 																								Gupta said certain steps can only be taken by the state urban development department. We can move only according to the municipal Act, he added.																								The Opposition charged the authorities with doing nothing to stop illegal land usage. What about the numerous plots where notices have been served for conducting business without a trade licence? asked Sabyasachi Dutta, Trinamul Congress councillor.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Post-Poila Baisakh, head Northeast. The tourism department is conducting a package trip to Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.																								The West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation (WBTDC), organising the tour, takes the first batch of visitors on April 16. The 11-day tour will cover scenic spots and the hill stations of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. According to tourism officials, though the WBTDC has conducted several guided tours of different states, apart from Nepal, Bhutan and the Andamans, this is the first time tourists from Calcutta are being taken to the Northeast.																								The itinerary includes Kamakshya, Bhalukpung, Bomdila, Tawang, Dirang and Tezpur, besides a Brahmaputra darshan. The cost: Rs 8,000 per head, inclusive of rail fare, meals and lodging.																								Assam and Arunachal are rich in scenic beauty but we could not organise any tours earlier, considering the security problems. The situation has improved and we have assurances from the respective state governments that the tourists will face no problems, said WBTDC managing director Sourin Bhattacharya.We have also held talks with tourism officials of the two states and they have assured us that the tourists need not fear, Bhattacharya added.																								According to WBTDC officials, the success of this trip will be backed up by tours to Meghalaya, Nagaland and Tripura.																								The WBTDC has taken up several programmes to boost tourism in the East. The people of Bengal enjoy travelling. Tourist spots and historical places dot the state, drawing lakhs from the state itself and elsewhere. Despite a severe funds crunch, we are making all efforts to boost tourism, Bhattacharya concluded.

 Wednesday, April 02, 2003 				 Shyamali Matir Kanya
Nature has inspired creativity from time immemorial. The Bard of Bengal Rabindranath Tagore was so inspired by nature that he set up his dream project, Visva Bharati, amid the greens of Santiniketan, the land of peace (santi). Since then, this quaint little hamlet has been the source of inspiration for all creative artists. Arunendu Banerjee is an engineer, an active environmentalist who expresses himself through his drawings and paintings. This self-taught artist/engineer has been instrumental in the designing and execution of a number of architectural and engineering projects. In fact, he was stationed at Santiniketan for some time, completing a number of projects. While there, he rediscovered Tagore and, along with his project, his drawings and paintings concretised. As Banerjee says, I cannot forget them, the everlasting relationship of land, people, environment. Shyamali, my Matir Kanya (the earthen lass) has unfolded her elegance in body, soul and mind... An exhibition of his paintings is on.																								When: Till April 6; 3 pm - 8 pm																								Where: Academy of Fine Arts, West Gallery

 That takes ovaries
  On the occasion of International Womens Day today, Thoughtship Foundation and Spandan are jointly hosting a unique programme of women reading and sharing real-life, bold, gutsy, courageous and inspirational stories. The programme, That Takes Ovaries! Open Mike Story Sharing Session is fun, easy, audience participatory and a triumph for women! The coinage of the term That takes Ovaries is very interesting. When a man does something particularly brave, it is lauded as, That takes balls! Now a woman has found the the right phrase (anatomically) for a similar act. The phrase was first coined in the US by Rivika Solomon in her book, That Takes Ovaries! Bold Females and Their Brazen Acts, a collection of real-life ovaries-filled stories from women and girls about the brazen, outrageous, audacious, courageous things they have done. The book culminated in a movement. That takes ovaries are very special open-mike story-sharing sessions where women come out of the closet to share their own acts of heroism, inspiring and motivating other women. These sessions are about hearing the voices of women of strength. This is the third open mike story sharing session in the country, to be anchored by Mira Kakkar and Renu Roy.When: Today; 5 pm - 7 pmWhere: The Teachers Centre,  Copyright

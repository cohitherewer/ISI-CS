 Monday, August 25, 2003 				 JU eyes legal lane to skip tax
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Jadavpur University (JU) has refused to buckle under Calcutta Municipal Corporations (CMC) property-tax pressure. A week after being issued an ultimatum to pay its dues or face the consequences, the university is even looking at a legal option.																								We are in a strong position, legally and ethically, JU senior superintendent Dulal (Jyotiprasanna) Das Thakur, also a Trinamul Congress councillor, said on Sunday. If one civic board waives some of our tax and another says no, why should we pay for indecision within the CMC?																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, however, said on Sunday: Educational institutions cannot dodge taxes for years on end. I have asked officials to prepare a status report so I can deal with the issue in its entirety.

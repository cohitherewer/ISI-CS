																																																		Renupada Ghosh, 60, was killed and 20 persons were seriously injured on Wednesday morning at Raibaghini in the Canning police station area, when a bus on route 80C overturned and fell into a pond. The injured included 11 women and two children. The Canning station-bound bus from Herobhanga had 40 passengers on board, consisting largely of office-goers. At around 10 am, the driver of the bus, which was travelling at a considerable speed, tried to save a cycle-van that had steered in its way. The bus lost control and fell into the pond. Workers of local factories rushed to the spot with gas-cutters and rescued the passengers. Additional superintendent of police, rural, B. Garg, said the injured were taken to the nearby Canning hospital and are presently undergoing treatment. A crane has been sent to retrieve the bus. Some of the injured are in a critical condition.																																																		A day after the arrest of Sudipta Bhowmick, 44, the detective department on Wednesday received calls from senior government officials and other people who were cheated by him.																																																								howmick was arrested on Monday evening at Shyambazar in the Shyampukur police station area. He used to go by the alias of Kalyan Chakraborty, and claimed to be the personal assistant of Biman Bose, the CPM leader. The detective department had its tail up after receiving tip-offs. When Bhowmick understood that the police were after him, he called up deputy commissioner of police, special, Piyush Pandey, impersonating Anil Biswas, and asked him to leave him alone as he was a party member. He used an Ambassador with a Maharashtra registration number and a red beacon and the national emblem. He had visited Kakdweep a year ago. He contacted the then SDPO of Diamond Harbour and had state hospitality provided to him. He also received Rs 40,000 from police officials, promising them plum posts. He also took Rs 85,000 to admit a businessmans daughter in Jadavpur University. He was picked up from Raja Manindra College in the Shyambazar area where he was moving around in a suspicious manner. 																																																		The state government on Wednesday took the first steps towards making some cosmetic changes with days to go for the Medical Council of India visit at University College of Medicine, adjacent to SSKM Hospital. On Wednesday, director of medical education C.R. Maity met senior officials, including SSKM surgeon superintendent D.D. Chattopadhyay. The DME, it was learnt, directed everyone to do their best to impress the MCI inspectors so that more seats (150) are granted for its undergraduate medical course. Later, the DME held another meeting with health department officials. This time health secretary Asim Barman was with him to explain the importance of a second visit within two months. The Telegraph had reported on Wednesday how the MCI team had challenged the governments claim of having the infrastructure for undergraduate classes at the UCM.

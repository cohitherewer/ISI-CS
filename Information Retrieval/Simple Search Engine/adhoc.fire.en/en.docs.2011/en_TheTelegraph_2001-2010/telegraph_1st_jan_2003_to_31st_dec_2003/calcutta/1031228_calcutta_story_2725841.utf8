 Sunday, December 28, 2003 				 Residents take legal route to stall tax hike
 A STAFF REPORTER																								Even as the Salt Lake civic authorities are busy calculating their increased income  thanks to a high court verdict delivered on Wednesday allowing the municipality to collect property tax as per the 1998 Central Valuation Board recommendation  residents of the township have started raising funds to move Supreme Court against the decision.																								We are appealing to all the block committees of Salt Lake to raise funds for fighting the case on behalf of the residents in the apex court, said Ramen Das, secretary of Bidhannagar (Salt Lake) Welfare Association, on Saturday. 																								The townships residents are worried over the fact that the court directive allows the property tax of Salt Lake to be raised by four to 25 times. 																								A large section of residents, especially those who are retired, will face problems in paying such high rates, which include arrears since 1998, Das said.																								Last Wednesday, a division bench of Calcutta High Court, comprising Justice Ashok Ganguly and Justice D.P. Sengupta, set aside an earlier court order which restrained the municipal authorities from collecting property tax as recommended by the board in 1998. 																								Presently, property tax in Salt Lake is calculated at the rate of Rs 40 per sq ft for ground floor and Rs 35 for other floors, civic officials said. However, the new rate will be calculated as per the boards directive, they added.																								Officials of the Salt Lake municipality will discuss the mode of implementing the board guideline once a copy of the high court verdict is available. 																								The new tax rate will push up our revenue from Rs 7 crore to Rs 13 crore, said Bidhannagar municipal chairman Dilip Gupta.																								The municipalitys revised budget for 2003-2004 plans to mop up more than Rs 7 crore from property taxes.																								The boards 1998 recommendation, if followed, would raise the civic bodys collections from the 22,000 houses in the township to around Rs 11 crore. But as there has been a 20 per cent increase in the number of buildings in Salt Lake since 1998, civic officials expect the earnings to cross Rs 13 crore. The increased earnings will help us undertake development work which was stalled due to dearth of funds, the municipal chairman explained. 																								Gupta said funds crunch has hit work on road repair, water supply, drainage and sewerage. Recently, the finance department turned down a Rs 1-crore grant extended by the state finance commission. We need to be self sufficient, he added.

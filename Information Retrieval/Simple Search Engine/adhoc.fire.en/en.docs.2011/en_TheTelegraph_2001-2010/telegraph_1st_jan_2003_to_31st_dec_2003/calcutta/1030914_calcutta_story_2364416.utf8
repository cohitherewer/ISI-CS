 MITA MUKHERJEE																								Between the aggrieved student and the court, stands the university. In a bid to curb the number of examination-related cases being filed by a section of undergraduate students seeking redress, Calcutta University (CU) has decided to allow examinees scoring zero in a particular paper to take a look at their answer-scripts.																								The aim is to initiate an interaction between the varsity and the students and prevent the matter from taking a legal turn. It is also expected to hold the varsity in good stead in the event of an examinee dragging it to court even after going through the answer-script.																								We wanted to provide an opportunity to the aggrieved examinee scoring no marks in a particular paper to check his or her answer-script before approaching the court, said Onkar Sadhan Adhikari, CU controller of examinations. Our idea was to prevent such students from challenging the evaluation of their performance. This tendency among students often goes against the interest of the university, he added.																								Concerned at the growing propensity of undergraduate examinees to petition the court after scoring low or no marks, officials this year identified 36 answer-scripts carrying a zero, prior to the publication of results.																								They announced at the time of declaration of results of the BA, B.Sc and B.Com examinations that these candidates could approach the examination department, along with their guardians or college representatives, to scan their scripts.																								We were surprised to find students getting a zero in subjects like mathematics and history. There were even students who got zeros in all four papers they sat for in the Part-II exams, said an official.																								Of the students who failed to get off the mark, only one has so far approached the examination department to check his answer-script. The student of a reputed college in Calcutta, however, was not satisfied after going through his philosophy answer-script and filed a petition in high court, praying for fresh evaluation. But the court ruled in favour of the varsity.																								CU officials, however, said lack of response from the aggrieved students to avail of the novel facility indicated the acceptance of their results.

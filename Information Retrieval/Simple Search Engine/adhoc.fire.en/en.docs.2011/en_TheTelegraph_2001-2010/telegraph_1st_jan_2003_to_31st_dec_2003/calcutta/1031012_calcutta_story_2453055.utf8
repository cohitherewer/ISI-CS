 A STAFF REPORTER																								A taxi driver robbed three businessmen of cash and garments worth around Rs 50,000 early on Saturday. Investigation revealed that the vehicle had been stolen a few days ago from Watgunge.																								The unidentified driver played a trick to rob the businessmen. He convinced the passengers that his vehicles engine had developed a technical snag and it needed to be pushed to make it start.																								The passengers followed the taxi drivers instruction and got down, told an official of the Watgunge police station. As soon as the businessmen started pushing, the driver started the engine and sped away, leaving the passengers stranded.																								According to police, the incident took place around 3.30 am. Three garment traders hired the taxi in front of Akra Phatak in the Metiabruz area. They were on their way to Chetla market and had bundles of garments with them, said the official.																								As the vehicle started on its way, two persons asked for a lift. The three traders did not suspect anything and allowed the duo to board.																								On the way to Chetla, the engine of the taxi suddenly stopped functioning. The driver made a few attempts to start. He, then, asked the passengers to get down and push the vehicle. All five agreed, said the official.																								The traders were surprised to see the other two passengers remaining silent even after the driver sped away. While we were talking about lodging a complaint with the nearest police station, the duo walked away, one of the businessmen told the police.																								The businessmen had noted down the licence number of the taxi (WB 19A 7202). Officials of Watgunge police station traced the owner to a Bangali Shah Lane address. But the taxi was stolen from Hastings thana area on October 9. A complaint had been lodged with the police station, said an officer.																								Police are looking for the two other passengers who disappeared immediately after the incident. Their role is suspicious. The traders told us that they saw the duo talking to the driver.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, June 25, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	It is annoying to see how some commuters have mastered  the art of slipping in and out of the Metro punching turnstile  without tickets. They stealthily stand very close to bona  fide passengers and sqeeze in or out. Sometimes, two friends  buy just one ticket. Metro Rail should see that its gates  are properly manned so that ticketless travellers cannot  add to its losses.

	Living on the narrow stretch called Russa Road, close to  Tollygunge Cemetery, is slowly turning into a nightmare.  The peace and tranquility of the area has been completely  shattered by a thick flow of vehicles. The constant honking  of lorries whizzing past throughout the day is just unbearable.  Kids are finding it difficult to concentrate on their studies,  but the elderly, suffering from heart ailments, are probably  the worst hit. Sound pollution in the area has also exceeded  the normal limits.

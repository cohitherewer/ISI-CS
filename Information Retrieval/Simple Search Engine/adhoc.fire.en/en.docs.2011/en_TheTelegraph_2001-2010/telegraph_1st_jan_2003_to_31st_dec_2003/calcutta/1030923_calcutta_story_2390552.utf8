 Tuesday, September 23, 2003 				 Of birds and beasts
																								The husband and wife duo, Shyam Kanu and Jayita Borthakur, have been working independently and in tandem with each other for quite sometime without ever losing ones individual style or infringing on each others territory. An exhibition of their recent works once again comes like a whiff of fresh air that rejuvenates the city art scene. Shyam Kanu has already made a mark in the contemporary art world with his beast series, depicting raw physical energy in the highly-charged bulls, wild boars, elephants and horses. His recent pre-occupation happens to be human figures, juxtaposed with birds and other animal forms. Man and the Birds  the series currently on view shows another facet of the artist. In this show, he has also worked on various animal forms, but has experimented with the presentation. Shyam Kanu plays with the space with rapid strokes in crayons and oils that finally take powerful forms with newer dimensions. Jayita has a unique sense of colours and compositions. She builds impressive surfaces in bright colours with utmost patience and mostly paints portraits, fishes, etc. in both oil and acrylic. 																								When: Till September 30 (except Sunday); Monday - Friday: 11 am - 7 pm; Saturday till 3 pm																								Where: Chemould Art Gallery, Queens Mansion, 12F, Park Street

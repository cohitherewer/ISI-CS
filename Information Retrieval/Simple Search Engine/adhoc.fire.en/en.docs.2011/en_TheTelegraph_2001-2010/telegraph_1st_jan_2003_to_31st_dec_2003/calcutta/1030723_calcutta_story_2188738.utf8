The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, July 23, 2003 				 Uplinked to amenities, grounded in basics
 A STAFF REPORTER				 	 DPS Society chief Salman Khurshid at the school on Monday 																								Its the youngest school in town, only 45 working days old. But with its collective international reputation, list of high-profile individuals associated with it and the promise to be the best, Delhi Public School-Kolkata (DPS-K) is growing, and growing rapidly at that.																								In town for a political rally on Monday, former external affairs minister and now chairman of the DPS Society Salman Khurshid paid a visit to the school at Kasba Rathtala, to check out how things were going, first-hand.																								At the moment, the school only has students from Class I to V, but plans are in the works for a much larger campus on the Bypass, which would house Class III upwards, with the current location accommodating only the toddlers.																								The larger construction, slated for completion in the next one year, will contain all the facilities considered a must for DPS institutions, including an open field, a state-of-the-art gymnasium and a swimming pool, says Khurshid.																								Additional facilities being incorporated into other DPS, which Calcutta, too, can look forward to, include a skating rink and horse-riding training. Thirty-five auditoriums have already been built in as many schools, with one to be constructed here as well. But all of this, space permitting.																								Apart from the structural embellishments, Calcutta can hope to see the DPS tradition of inter-school competitions in the next couple of years. A chess competition next month, the second Global Conference for Children, entitled Listen, to be held in November, the basketball tournament, an international cricket contest In the regional competitions, Calcutta will soon be the host destination.																								With 120 schools all over the world, it often becomes too cumbersome to get students from all the DPS gathered at one place. So, what we do is have regional-level events. Calcutta, in a few years, will be the eastern region location for such events, says Khurshid.																								However, academics still rules, and with no compromises. Satellite linkups, for live conferencing through computers, to provide the most modern method of teaching, has already been installed in around 19 schools, and the plan, explains Khurshid, is to take it to the rest in the next few months, DPS-K included.																								The thing about places like Mumbai, Dehra Dun and Calcutta is that the standard of education is so good that the reputation of the product is very high. So, we have to compete with some really worthy institutions on their home ground. Hence, we cant afford to slack off, he says, adding that in this city, there were the least problems in terms of expectations, from teachers, parents and students.																								Although the first CBSE final results wont show before another five years, when the first batch sits for the board exams, Khurshid feels that the students performance inside and outside the classroom, particularly in local competitions, will prove the DPS point. For instance, 30 students from the school are participating in a national-level science contest next month.																								The reports we have been receiving from DPS-K so far have been good, and there is positive feedback from teachers going back and forth for training programmes. The school is shaping up well, Khurshid signs off.

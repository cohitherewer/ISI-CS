	Waterlogging in north Calcutta during the recent showers  has once again shown that the heavily-silted Bagjola canal  is primarily responsible for the sufferings caused to the  people. The filthy water had even entered some houses in  the low-lying area. Unauthorised settlers on the bank of  the canal are also to blame for this plight. Political parties  are unwilling to evict them as they form a large part of  the vote bank. But why should tax-paying citizens put up  with all this?

	Mayor Subrata Mukherjee had recently announced a phone  number (1600333375) to help citizens get mutation of their  land. When I called up this number, the employee who took  the call simply advised me to contact the assessor collector,  who is apparently the only authority who could help out.  I have already submitted five sets of applications for the  mutation of a plot but none of these could be traced in  the civic office. Is the mayors announcement just an eyewash? 
	 Murari Lal, Chamru Khansama Lane.

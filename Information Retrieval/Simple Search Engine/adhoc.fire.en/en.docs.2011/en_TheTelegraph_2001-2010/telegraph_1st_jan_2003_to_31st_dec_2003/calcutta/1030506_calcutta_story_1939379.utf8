Newly-appointed British deputy high commissioner Andrew Hall cited the EU as a potential model for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).																								 Many of the problems the EU faced in pooling sovereignty and boosting economic cooperation remain important issues here, he said.																								Anil Patni of the Commission stressed the EUs importance to India in conducting negotiations with the WTO.

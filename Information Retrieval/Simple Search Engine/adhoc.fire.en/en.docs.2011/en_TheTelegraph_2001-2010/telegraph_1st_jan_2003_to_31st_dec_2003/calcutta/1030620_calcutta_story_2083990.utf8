	The Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, an arterial route that  allows a smooth ride, is slowly losing its charm. Craters  have appeared on the road surface at quite a few places.  Besides, several trees lining the stretch have been chopped  off to make way for multi-storeyed buildings. Further neglect  by the civic authorities will make this road more craggy  and unfit for travel.  
	Bhupen Bose, Dum Dum.  
	Placement cells that have cropped up in several pockets  of the city are misleading youths looking for jobs. The  job offers of these agencies come with a training programme  for which they charge an exorbitant fee from candidates.  After three to six months, the candidates are recruited  in some firm for a paltry sum of Rs 1,000-1,500. This is  possible only due to the nexus between the placement cells  and private firms. The government must crack down on these  agencies before the unemployed are duped in greater numbers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 On stage, able, but differently
 A special performance at Vidya Mandir on Sunday. Picture by Aranya Sen To call Kshitij 2003 just another fest would be a misnomer. This assembly of talent and grit, passion and perseverance organised by the Rotaract Club of Belur, in association with the Interact Club of Mahadevi Birla Girls and the social service unit of Birla High (Girls), threw up several heroes among differently-abled and specially-talented children. And every participant proved to be a winner.July 6 was the date and Vidya Mandir the venue for a dazzling display from these special children who rarely get a stage to show their talent. They put up such well-crafted performances that the judges had a tough time choosing the best. An audience of around 800 that included students, parents, teachers and guests witnessed something very unusual. What began with the participation of only nine schools saw a total of 22 institutions  Mentaid, Shirc, Reach, Uttarayan, Rotary Bal Vikas Kendra, Greenfields and many more  signing up for this carnival with a difference.Former mayor Shyam Sundar Gupta lit the inaugural lamp, followed by the felicitation of some Rotaractors and Rotarians. The various rounds of competition ranged from fancy dress to song and dance and the ever-popular sit-and-draw. The art competitions were held in the respective schools, with students depicting terrorism and communal harmony with flair and imagination, making judge (artist and interior decorator) Kiran Majumdars job a difficult one.The days events started off with the fancy dress competition that found the Charlie Chaplins mingling with sadhus, brides battling beggars to make the grade. Next in line was the cultural presentation in the form of dance and drama, songs and mime. It began with the girls of Shirc putting up a stupendous performance. A groovy foot-tapping performance by the students of Mentaid to the song Dhoom pichak dhoom brought the auditorium to its feet and set it rocking. Judges Veena Kichlu (theatrician) and Pandit Bhajan Sopori (santoor maestro) picked the girls of Shirc as the best.The cultural presentation was followed by a cartoon show  Tom and Jerry on film  that all but brought the house down. Adding to the fun were cartoon characters and clowns invading the auditorium, shaking hands with the excited kids and offering them chocolates galore. Emcees Leena Bardhan from Noble Mission and Rotarian Ankur Garg did their bit to help the children have a blast.At the end of the days play, every participant received certificates and lunch-boxes. Winners in each category got gift packs sponsored by Nestl. The Rotaract Club of Belur also gave each of the participating schools carrom boards. A student from the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy bagged a special prize for painting with his feet. But it was Shirc that swept the prize stakes.The on-stage action aside, there was also an exhibition-cum-sale of handicrafts, cards, and drawings made by the specially-talented children, outside the auditorium. This was an effort to enhance the pursuits of the mentally and physically challenged children by offering them a stage to reveal their talents in the form of dance, drama, art and fancy dress and to make them believe that they are, indeed, a part of society. And once on stage, they proved they were no less than their normal counterparts, summed up Rotarian Vinay Mundhra, president, Rotaract Club of Belur.The curtains came down with the felicitation of all the judges, designer Nilanjana Chakraborty (wife of actor Arjun Chakraborty) and Barry OBrien, and a formal vote of thanks by Ankur Garg  but not before the pledge of a bigger, brighter and better Kshitij round the corner.

The Calcutta International School campaign sold the best. The UN Mock witnessed a discussion about the alleged impotency of the organisation and the US-led war in Iraq, with St James finally being adjudged the best. The day was rounded off on a musical note with Karma Jazz, the western music competition, and a victory for the boys from the home team, with their repertoire of classical and rock music.The five-round Karma Quiz showed how Calcutta Boys School could out-answer the rest.

The tabla exponent explained the way rhythm can be used in our daily lives, emphasising that every child should learn some form of music for the fun of it.The group learnt how to play a drum with parts of the body, a table, or on the floor. Students then fired their question on technicalities of music and career options.

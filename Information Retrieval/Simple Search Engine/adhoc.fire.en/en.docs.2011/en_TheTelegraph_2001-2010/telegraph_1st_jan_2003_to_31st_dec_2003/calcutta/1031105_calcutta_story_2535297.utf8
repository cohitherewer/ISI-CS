 Wednesday, November 05, 2003 				 Tracks of teething trouble
				 	 wait for signal: Passengers bear the brunt as train services are suspended for the route-relay interlocking system installation																								Indranil Sengupta,																								Salt Lake.																								nI am sure the new system will improve matters at Howrah station, but it will take some time. The staff are yet to get over the teething troubles. But all problems cannot be solved just by installing a route-relay interlocking system. The condition of platforms need to be bettered. We will have to wait to reap the benefits.																								Sayan Ghosh																								Address not given.																								nThe railway staff will take some time to adjust to the new system, but once the initial hitches are overcome, services will certainly improve. Passengers will not have to wait for long outside the station, as in Sealdah now. The change is most welcome.																								RIMLI DATTA,																								Salt Lake.																								nThe route-relay interlocking system has improved services at Howrah station but only to a certain extent. A huge sum has been spent on installing this technology, but services are still irregular. The phenomenal improvement that people had expected is not yet palpable. 																								SUBHADIP BODHAK,																								College Street.																								nDefinitely yes. There is room for further improvement but it will take time. It is a pity that people could not hold their patience as they expected a dramatic change overnight. A lot of people have started criticising the efficiency of this project, but they must remember that the system has worked wonders in other metropolitan cities. Commuters need to co-operate with the authorities.																								T.R. ANAND,																								Budge Budge.																								nThe route-relay interlocking system has failed to click. Even a couple of days ago, incoming trains from Tikiapara and Liluah stations were delayed in reaching their respective platforms at Howrah. Can the authorities say why? Perhaps, a more scientific approach to the new system was required. The Howrah station has so many platforms at its disposal, it must make good use of these. 																								SUSHMA JALAN, 																								Alipore.																								nThe two-day closure to instal the route-relay interlocking system was the first instance in the history of Howrah station. Commuters suffered immensely but without complaining, in the hope that in future, the services will improve and they will benefit. But services at Howrah station are still in a sorry state. Trains are rarely on time and commuters are left stranded. To add to the commuters woes, there is no official around to guide him about the new timings, or an alternative he could take to reach his destination. Chaos prevails at any given hour. Simply installing modern systems will not improve services, the secret lies in implementing them with dedication. 																								jayanta datta,																								Chinsurah.																								nNo, the situation has not improved much since the installation of the new system. There are several reasons behind the fiasco. First, the railway authorities focused on publicity rather than on providing service to commuters. Second, they did not take help from world-class technology, and third, they used poor-quality materials for the work. 																								DEBYANI BASU,																								Birati.																								nTrain services were till recently regulated by a signalling system operated manually. The efficacy of the system depended entirely on the operator manning it. In the past, services have crashed quite often because of the incompetence of the signalling staff. Passengers could rarely reach their destination on time. The resultant logjam would take hours, even days, to sort out. 																								At times, harried commuters would even ransack stations and damage railway equipment because trains were inevitably behind schedule. The recently-installed route-relay interlocking system is a boon for passengers. It is computerised and, therefore, less vulnerable to human error. Kudos to the railways for making Howrah a haven for rail travel.																								UDAYAN Banerjee,																								Hooghly.																								nOn the contrary, the much-hyped new system has only succeeded in disrupting train services. During its installation, passengers suffered immensely. After its installation, the hardships continue. Howrah-bound local trains are still held up, sometimes for hours, at the carshed, playing havoc with passengers schedules. Even long-distance trains dont leave the station on time. The benefits of the new system are yet to be passed on to passengers.																								Diptimoy Ghosh,																								Salt Lake.																								nThis was the first time ever that Howrah station was completely closed for almost two days. But passengers did not complain as they thought the new system would ensure that trains would not have to wait for a platform. But trains are now having to wait longer outside the station  the waiting time was earlier around 10 minutes and now it is no less than 20 minutes. So, train services have deteriorated and commuters have actually been inconvenienced by the new facility. Office-goers are being forced to catch an earlier train or be late for office.																								tanooka bhadra,																								Address not given.																								nThe system has failed to steer a turnaround. All local and express trains are made to wait at signal-points for more than half an hour at Howrah station regularly just as it used to be before. Sometimes, commuters walk from the signal-point to the station platform, come rain or shine. The problem is acute for women and schoolchildren.																								SANANDA SEN,																								Address not given.																								nThe recently-installed route-relay interlocking system has definitely bettered services at Howrah station. Trains have become more or less regular and passengers, too, are happy as they are not delayed for office any more. 																								Joy Chatterjee,																								Shyambazar.																								nServices are bound to improve with the new system but we will have to wait till it is fully operational. The lack of discipline has been a handicap in implementing the technology so far.																								Debasish Chakraborty,																								Chitpur.																								nThe signalling system has certainly benefited both commuters and the authorities. It has enabled the railway management to steer clear of accidents. If this practice carries on, accidents will not occur.																								SUNIL BANERJEE,																								VIP Road.																								nIt is yet to be seen if the recently-installed route-relay interlocking system will help improve services at Howrah station. Even after the system was installed, local trains were leaving platforms behind schedule, and complete chaos prevailed in the station. The new system was installed to improve services, but I fear passengers are yet to taste its benefits.

  Moving to Mumbai: Vivek Oberoi being  shifted out of CMRI Buffoonery and politics are not the same. Trinamul MLA Saugata Roy led the dwellers of the railway shanties near Rabindra Sarobar to take a dip in the water and swear that they would not leave their occupied places near the railway line (Quit call in save-Lakes suit, Metro, July 24). The people living in the hutments near the railway line are not necessarily refugees from Bangladesh. Most of them have their residences in the suburbs of the metropolis. They live in an abjectly unhygenic condition, polluting the Lake with their washing and cleaning chores, and relieving themselves wherever they wish.  The genuine refugees uprooted from across the border must be rehabilitated properly. But this favour should not be showered upon settlers who are actually usurpers. Besides, the people of the hutments often encroach upon the railway lines, compelling the trains to slow down, to the great annoyance and inconvenience of the commuters. A permanent solution is badly needed, shorn of pseudo-socialist poses aimed at political gains.  Arjun Kumar Roy,
 Surya Sen Street.  The report Body blow to bone doctors (Metro, July 18) was disturbing. Actor Vivek Oberoi opting to get himself out of CMRI and Oberoi Senior taking his son to a Mumbai hospital is an insult to our surgeons. It showed once again that people have lost trust in Calcutta hospitals. The recent spurt in patients fleeing Calcutta for Mumbai and the southern states points to the lack of medicare and the outdated technology here. The chief minister needs to take action.  T.R. Anand,
 Budge Budge.  The report Home lost to party office (Metro, July 21) once again proves the power of the ruling party, whose cadres are always out to harass common people. As these hoodlums are backed by corrupt leaders, the FIR lodged by the poor family will remain a piece of paper unless the Opposition makes an issue of it.  Gunjeet S. Wadhwa,
 Rai Bahadur Road.  Kudos to Thierry, the Frenchman, for providing support to destitute and orphans in Calcutta (Where nowhere children have a hope, Metro, July 19). Religion makes no difference to his organisation and he looks after children of all religions so that they study and can stand on their own feet. There are hundreds of such orphans here and more such NGOs are required.  Bhupen Bose,
 Dum Dum Park.  Apropos the report Second Lucknow fixed in sepia (Metro, July 14), it is interesting to learn how the exiled Nawab Wajid Ali Shah made Metiabruz the second Lucknow. The photographs have historical value and deserve to be preserved.  Prahlad Agarwala,
 Nadia. It is not for nothing that politics is called a dirty game these days (Murder accused had political backing, Metro, July 17). We need to join hands to weed out this evil from society.  Kunal Roy,
 Howrah.  A middle-class family falls in a helpless mess when a member is diagnosed with a disease like thalassaemia (For all a second chance at survival, Metro, July 17). By extending a hand of help, Indian Association of Blood Cancer and Allied Diseases has wiped the tears of many who did not have the means for treatment.  Sunil Banerjee,
 VIP Road.  All sense of logic and morality vanish into thin air when one finds that personal grudge of a head examiner against a students father can result in such a criminal act (HS Council pays student wrong marks damages, Metro, July 16). This smacks of mindless vindictiveness, instances of which now permeate every section of society. Hopefully, Justice Barin Ghoshs judgement would go a long way to curb such practices.  Indranil Chaudhuri,
 Address not given.

																																																																																		Eight dacoits robbed Rs 8 lakh from traders on their way from Barasat to Posta on Friday. According to police, a car carrying Nandagopal Pal and two others, who run a grocery shop in Barasat, were stuck in a traffic jam at Bankra, near Dum Dum airport. The armed goons, who were following the traders on their motorcycles, opened the door of the car and before the traders could realise what was happening, they snatched the suitcase containing the cash. When passersby spotted the snatch and raised an alarm, the dacoits took to their heels. One of the goons, Raju Hela, fell down and was caught. In a bid to rescue Raju, other gang members hurled bombs and fired a few shots at the mob. Md Akbar, a local resident, suffered splinter injuries, while Raju was arrested.																																																		There was confusion at Shyambazar Metro station on Friday afternoon as passengers of a train pulled the emergency chain, complaining of suffocation and smoke in five coaches.

				 																																										lA random check of trade licences by municipal commissioner Debasis Som himself on Wednesday revealed that several businessmen were running their trade either without trade licence or with invalid ones. Som, along with licence officers, raided shops on Rabindra Sarani. Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said licence officers will visit shops and verify their licences. Licence officers of the locality will face disciplinary action if more than 10 per cent unlicensed shops were detected in their area. The total number of trade licences issued by the CMC is less than 2 lakh to date.				 																																										Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Wednesday said only 70 per cent literacy was achieved in the state and efforts were being made to increase the rate. He was speaking at the concluding session of Vidyasagar Mela, held on the Maidan.				 																																										The chief minister said the government had taken major initiatives to improve the lot of rural women by providing them with basic education and involving them in self-employment schemes. It is encouraging that women in villages are forming self-help groups. However, in some villages, women are still lagging, Bhattacharjee added. He said though some states, particularly Kerala, were ahead of Bengal in literacy, the government is serious about achieving total literacy. We are taking measures so that children in villages can get basic education. That is why we are involving mass organisations, he maintained. Left Front chairman Biman Bose announced that the Vidyasagar Foundation will set up girls schools in all districts. We shall start a school in Purulia shortly which will be run without government aid, he added. 				 																																										The family of Sonali Bose, a medical college intern who was killed by the police on Agra-Mathura Road in July who mistook her for a terrorist, has turned down a cheque for Rs 25,000 offered by the Uttar Pradesh government as compensation. Boses family members said they had returned the cheque suggesting that it be sent to the National Human Rights Commission which was investigating the case. They had moved the NHRC, demanding a probe into the death and a compensation. 				 																																										Activities at Calcutta University were hit on Wednesday with members of all three employees unions holding rallies. The CPM union held a token ceasework at Rajabazar Science College, demanding recruitment in vacant posts of non-teaching staff. The Calcutta University Employees Unity Centre controlled by a Naxalite faction and the Intuc union observed protest day on all the campuses, seeking withdrawal of the attendance rules introduced in January 2002.				 																																										Barun Roy, 40, went missing from MR Bangur Hospital from Wednesday morning. Hospital superintendent Debasish Haldar said a complaint was lodged with Regent Park police station. Roy was admitted to the hospital a few days ago.				 																																										O swami vivekananda yoga anusandhan samsthana for organising a free yoga camp on Bakhtiar Shah Road

 Sunday, November 16, 2003 				 Police await youth return from coma
 A STAFF REPORTER																								There seems to be no solution in sight to the mystery of Mithun Koley till he gains consciousness. The 22-year-old has been lying in a coma ever since he was found in the Nilratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital compound on Thursday. 																								Both the state and Calcutta police have started separate investigations into the incident, but none has been able to make any headway yet. 																								The son of Ashim Koley, a businessman of Dum Dum, had gone missing on Monday and was picked up from behind the gynaecological department building on Thursday with his face smashed beyond recognition. He is battling for his life in the intensive care unit of a Salt Lake nursing home.																								Mithun has suffered multiple injuries on the head, neck, shoulder, arms and legs. It seems he was severely beaten up. There was also an attempt to strangle him, said Ajay Nand, additional superintendent of police, Salt Lake, on Saturday. A clear picture will emerge only after he regains consciousness.																								Officer-in-charge of Entally police station A.B. Majumdar said a case of attempt to murder and abduction against unknown miscreants has been started.																								Though police said the family had received ransom calls, one of Mithuns relatives denied the statement. Mithun studies commerce in Bangalore and had come to visit his parents on Kali puja. He has no enemies and we dont know the motive behind this incident, he said, preferring anonymity.

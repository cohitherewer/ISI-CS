The Telegraph - Calcutta
 A picture is worth a thousand words 
- Buyers snap up cellphones with cameras, handset price slash to boost sales DEVADEEP PUROHIT  sect;Wireless camera phones will outsell digital still cameras by 2004 and by 2007, one in every five cellular phones sold will have an embedded camera. sect;Multimedia messaging service (MMS) subscribers will witness a 178 per cent compound annual growth rate and by 2007, the number will go up to 52 million.Sound is not enough; sight is a must. Having a cellphone is not enough; having an embedded camera is a must. Sending text messages is pass; a photo-message is a must. Seeing is believing is the new motto of the mobile trade, so dont just key in the words, capture the picture, compose the message and fire it to the recipient.The findings from two recent surveys by Strategy Analytics and IDC, conducted across countries, catch the sudden surge in camera phones and MMS, and forecast a bright future.

The service is getting popular and we expect it to witness a quantum jump in subscriber numbers, once the handset prices drop further, adds Gulati.Already, there are indications from the phone manufacturers that besides better-quality handsets flooding the market shortly, prices will slide to make the camera phones more affordable. According to the Strategy Analytics report, 16 million camera phones were sold worldwide in 2002, and their volume will grow up to 147 million by 2007. We launched our V200 phones recently and they were sold out in a very short period of time. In the next six to 12 months, we will hit the market with a slew of new models, says Anuj Kapur, country head (telecom) marketing and infrastructure, Samsung India Electronics Ltd.Gautam Advani, head, marketing and corporate communications, Nokia, also confirms the positive response from the market with integrated digital camera phones like 3650, 7250 and 7650, becoming big draws.

		 Roshni Bose Roshni Bose																									Are what Roshni began with, but spread her horizons later to explore options and discover her talents. The ex-student of Assembly of God Church started small, as a member of the school choir, taking part in school competitions and going out on carol-singing expeditions (one of her favourite occupations). Dont forget her attempts at elocution and debating, which only left her wanting something else																									Was what prompted her to take up acting. She was on a public platform right from school, as a member of Fingerprints cast, at Nazrul Mancha. Several school fests followed, besides intra-school productions as part of the drama club. The theatre thread Rosh picked up again in Loreto College, on and off campus.																									On the 20-year-olds first professional appearance as a member of Theatrecian. There followed several others  The Birthday Party, Zoo Story and Hayavadana. The Julia Roberts admirer even acted in a Coffee House production at Trincas. Taking part in college productions, of course, is an essential part of life. Laurels for the English literature student include the best actress award in the inter-year play in college in 2003. And shes getting ready for the upcoming Theatrecian play in January.																									Is what Roshni is cutting out for herself. The Manish Malhotra-fan has built up a fashionable wardrobe for herself, friends and family, and is sure of where her future lies. But good sense made her choose a degree, despite getting into NIFT last year. After graduation in 2004, however, shes determined to enter the fashion world and follow in the footsteps of her favourite designers.																									The Leo is, too, but not necessarily in that order. Sketching cartoons and caricatures is a hobby the budding artist likes to pursue in her free time, partly doodling but mostly drawing her love for Archie and his Riverdale friends. Dancing she took up in a jazz workshop last year, which ended in a performance at Tolly Club.

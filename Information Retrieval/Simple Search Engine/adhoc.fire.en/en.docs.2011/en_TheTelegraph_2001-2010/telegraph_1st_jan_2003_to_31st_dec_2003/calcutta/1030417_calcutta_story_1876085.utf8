 The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too hard,/ The passion that left the ground to lose itself in the sky,/Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;/ Enough that he heard it once; we shall hear it by-and-by...  Robert Browning																								Music is indeed mans innermost devotion to the Almighty. In fact, the very origin of Indian classical music can be traced to an ancient heritage of offering prayers to appease the Creator. The various ragas, their vistaar, alaap, etc, originated as modes of paying homage to gods. The esraj has found pride of place in Indian classical concerts from time immemorial, essentially as an accompanying instrument. However, its melodious sound and haunting music add a vast dimension to its role in accompaniment. This evening, the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture hosts a solo esraj recital by maestro Buddhadev Das, professor of esraj at Visva Bharati, Santiniketan. He will be accompanied on the tabla by Sandip Ghosh.																								When: Today at 6 pm																								Where: The Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Vivekananda Hall

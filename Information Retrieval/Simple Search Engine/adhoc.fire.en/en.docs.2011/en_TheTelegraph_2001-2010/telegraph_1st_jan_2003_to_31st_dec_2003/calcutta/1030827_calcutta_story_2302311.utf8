 Wednesday, August 27, 2003 					 					 It's Your Birthday So... Philosophy, religion and spirituality  interest you. You are dreamy and imaginative and may not  care for facts and figures. You are passionate about the  things that you do. You are much more knowledgeable than  your peers. You are flexible and can adjust to the requirements  of any situation.  Kusum Bhandari

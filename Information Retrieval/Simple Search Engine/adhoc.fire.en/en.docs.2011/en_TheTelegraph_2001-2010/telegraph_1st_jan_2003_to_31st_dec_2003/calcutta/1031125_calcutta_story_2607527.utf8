 Tuesday, November 25, 2003 				 Law snaps up Siliguri outlaw
 A STAFF REPORTER																								He travelled the long road  from Siliguri to Entally  to try and beat the long arm of the law. But it finally caught up with him in Jorasanko, on Monday afternoon.																								Sheikh Mehendi Hassan, 28, wanted in eight murder cases in north Bengal, had managed to stay a step ahead of the Siliguri police for the past five years. A few weeks ago, the extortionist and murderer had opened fire at cops in front of the residence of the additional superintendent of police in Siliguri.																								We have been closing in on him for the past two months, said Timir Bhattacharya, officer-in-charge of Jorasanko police station. Initially, we had information that Hassan was holed up in the Kalabagan area. But we recently came to know that he was staying at his father-in-laws house in Motijhil, in the Entally police station area.																								A Monday morning tip-off brought the cops to a hideout near a morgue. With no photograph to guide us, we depended on an informer, who pointed him out to us before we arrested Hassan, said an official of Jorasanko police station.																								In the course of interrogation, it was revealed that Siliguri was Hassans happy hunting ground. Siliguri is where the auction of several materials, including railway iron scrap, is held round the year. Each auctioneer would have to pay us Rs 50,000 to Rs 100,000, Hassan told police.																								The terror of Siliguri  who killed businessman Rana Ghosh and son Rupam in 1997  had made Calcutta his hideout since July. During this period, he visited Siliguri often but would regularly return to the city, said OC Bhattacharya.																								We have informed Siliguri police about the arrest and they should arrive here on Tuesday morning, he added.

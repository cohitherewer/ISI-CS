The Telegraph - Calcutta : Calcutta
 Star Spot
  Is the alias Dronodeb goes by for the wealth of knowledge he carries around with him. Who better to call when in a spot on the hotseat than this IIM-Ahmedabad guy, with a history of topping exams, quizzing his way to the name at the top of the honour roll. Appearing for the Madhyamik exams from Ramakrishna Mission, Purulia, in 1994, Dronodeb ranked 17th in the state with 91.3 per cent. Outdid his own track record when, after two years at RKM Narendrapur, he came 14th in the Higher Secondary exams with 89.5 per cent. Made his way to Jadavpur University to pursue a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering, only to leave their portals for the Chandernagore guy with the sterling stats. But not before he worked for a year at Infosys as software engineer, doing a project for the trendy clothing label GAP. They turned to him to monitor the quality of a 30-member suffers from. He has diversified his investment portfolio, having served as class rep in college, played on the engineering department cricket and football teams and organised technical seminars on campus. Now he serves as sports secretary at IIM-A, willing to put on the spikes and hit the football and cricket pitches to others the most precious gift he has received: the one-time National Service Scheme member taught underprivileged kids and organised literacy drives. If the good karma comes back his way, the man who came second in the Kshudiram Memorial Prize Essay Competition across all RKM schools and won a Rotary inter-school quiz competition in Purulia will taste success on BBC Mastermind.

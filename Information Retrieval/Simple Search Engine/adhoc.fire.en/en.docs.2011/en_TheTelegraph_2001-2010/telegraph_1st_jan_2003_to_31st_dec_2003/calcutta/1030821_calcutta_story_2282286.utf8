 Thursday, August 21, 2003 				 Student adds to toll on Metro tracks 
 A STAFF REPORTER																								A college student committed suicide on Wednesday morning by jumping in front of a train pulling into the Shyambazar Metro station. Police said Ashis Gupta was a second-year B. Com student of Maharaja Manindra Chandra College, in north Calcutta.																								Witnesses later said Ashis was standing at one end of the platform as the Dum Dum-bound train reached Shyambazar at around 9.15 am. He jumped at the last moment and by the time the train ground to a halt, two compartments had passed over him.																								Police and Metro personnel retrieved the body and found the college identity card in a trouser pocket. No suicide note was found. The body was sent to RG Kar Medical College for post--mortem.																								Train services were disrupted for about half an hour following the latest in a string of Metro suicides. This, despite the authorities trying out various methods to try and curb the death count on the tracks.																								Police said the address on Ashiss ID card was not where he lived. He used to live with his relatives on Krittibas Mukherjee Road, near Ultadanga. Later in the evening, one of his relatives arrived at RG Kar Medical College and identified Ashis body.																								Police said Ashis parents live in Allahabad. His father, Omprakash Gupta, has been informed of the tragedy and is said to be on his way to Calcutta. It seems he was not doing well in his exams for some time and had a brief altercation over the telephone regarding this with his parents, said deputy commissioner of police (north) P. Ravi.																								An unnatural death case had been filed and a probe is on. We can only come to a conclusion after speaking to his parents, friends and college authorities, said Ravi.

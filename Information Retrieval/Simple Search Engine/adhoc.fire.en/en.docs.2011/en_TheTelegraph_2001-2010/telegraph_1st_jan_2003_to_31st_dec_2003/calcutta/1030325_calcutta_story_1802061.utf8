				 																																										A division bench of Calcutta High Court on Monday passed an interim stay order on the verdict delivered by Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya, restraining the Calcutta Municipal Corporation from giving effect to a rule empowering the civic body to disconnect water supply for non-payment of property tax. The bench, comprising Chief Justice A.K. Mathur and Justice J. Biswas, however, said the stay order would not affect the cases which were being heard by the bench. The court passed this verdict on the basis of an appeal by the state government. Earlier, the court had stayed the implementation of the same judgment of the trial court on an appeal by the civic body. As the state was also a party in the case heard by Justice Bhattacharya, the government filed a fresh appeal against the verdict. The stay order obtained by the state strengthens the hand of mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who is fighting his party supremo Mamata Banerjee on the issue. Mamata has reportedly requested the mayor not to go ahead with the water disconnection drive in the greater interest of the party.				 																																										Two persons were arrested from a guest house in the Taltala area on Monday on charges of cheating asthma patients by feeding them live lyata fish. After receiving complaints from several people who had been treated by them, the police rounded up Mallikarjun Prasad and his associate, Sheikh Haja Mahedin. Forged papers, bearing the state health departments stamp, were recovered from them. The two were remanded in police custody till April 5. Police said the duo hailed from Hyderabad and had been camping in Howrah and Calcutta for the past two months. They used to charge a fee of Rs 390 for a dose (a small live lyata fish). Prasad even distributed handbills claiming that the treatment would cure asthma within 15 days. Soumen Mitra, deputy commissioner of the detective department, said: We have also booked them under the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, which states that feeding anyone with live fish cannot cure a disease. We decided to arrest the duo when patients told us that eating the fish did not yield any result. The detective department received the first complaint from Bharatiya Bigyan-O-Juktibadi Samity.

Demanding an independent probe into the matter, Bleach also sought the prosecution of a section of police officers of Presidency jail and Hastings police station. Metropolitan magistrate S.R.

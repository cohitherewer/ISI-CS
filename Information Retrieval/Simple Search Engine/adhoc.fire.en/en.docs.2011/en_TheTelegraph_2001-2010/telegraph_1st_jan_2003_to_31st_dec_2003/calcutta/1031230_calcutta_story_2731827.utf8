 Tuesday, December 30, 2003 				 Late-night headcount to rein in constables
 PRONAB MONDAL																								Wiser after the Bapi Sen episode last year, the police have introduced a number of measures, including a late-evening roll-call, to keep their men in the barracks across the city under control. 																								Barrack officers in-charge have been asked to keep an eye on constables even after duty hours on December 31.																								Last years incident has tarnished our image. So, we will take a stern stand to ensure that not a single constable leaves his barracks even after the completion of duty, said a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.																								Generally, rolls are called twice a day in the barracks. We count the constables at 9 am and 8.30 pm. But on December 31, there will be a special headcount between 10.30 pm and 11 pm, said the officer.																								Last week, all officers and company commandants of the Reserve Force (RF), to which the five rogue cops who battered Sen to death belonged, were called to the office of the deputy commissioner and given a dressing-down. Beware, there should not be any trouble. No one should leave the barracks. This is what our superiors told us, said a commandant, who was asked to keep a vigil on his men. But we have not been given any instruction in writing.																								The superiors in charge of the RF conducted a study on the attitude of their men in the barracks. An assistant commissioner, quoting from the track record of RF constables, said some constables are considered efficient in law-keeping, but eare xtremely erratic and indisciplined otherwise.																								Last year, constables were caught several times returning drunk to their barracks. They often stayed out late and had been warned repeatedly by their seniors to watch their step, said an RF official.																								Besides, heavy police bandobast will try to ensure a peaceful New Years eve. Sleuths from the detective department and special branch will take up position in front of discos and bars to prevent unruliness. At least 2,000 policemen will be deployed at 40 points across the city, said H.P. Singh, deputy commissioner, headquarters.																								At least 60 hotels and bars applied for permission to close late on the night of December 31. We have requested them to take care of their guests and not to allow them to go astray in a drunken state, said Singh.

 Friday, October 03, 2003 				 Rally pleas dry up
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The police said on Thursday that in the wake of Justice Amitava Lalas order, no organisation or outfit had sought permission to hold a rally in the city.																								Requests are pending but no new applications have come in this week, said deputy commissioner (traffic) M.K. Singh. This is probably because of the Pujas. No rallies are held at this time of the year. Singh said he had yet to receive a certified copy of the order, so we are not aware of what we are expected to do.																								In the absence of a certified copy, police had adopted a wait-and-watch policy till the government sought a stay. Now that a stay has not been granted, let us see how the situation develops, an officer said.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								One person died and eight others were injured when a fire broke out in a Beniapukur factory on Saturday evening. The condition of four persons has been stated to be critical.																								The victim was identified as Mohammed Hyder, a 23-year-old employee of the leather shoe manufacturing unit, who got trapped while dousing the flames. The body has been sent for post-mortem. 																								According to Beniapukur police, the factory workers noticed smoke billowing from the ground-floor unit of the three-storeyed building around 6 pm. 																								Instead of informing the fire brigade, they started dousing the flames themselves. Around eight workers entered the unit and got trapped. Others dragged them out and took them to hospital. One of the workers succumbed to injuries, said a fire brigade official. 																								Two fire tenders were pressed into service.																								As the news spread, residents went on the rampage at National Medical College and Hospital, where Hyder was admitted. The mob ransacked the emergency department and heckled the hospital staff, alleging negligence in treatment.

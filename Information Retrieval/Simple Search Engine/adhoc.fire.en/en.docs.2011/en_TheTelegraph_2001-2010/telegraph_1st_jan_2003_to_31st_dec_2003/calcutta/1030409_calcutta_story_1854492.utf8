 Wednesday, April 09, 2003 				 Tease teenager in police trap
 																											- Youth arrested for whistling at schoolgirl walking home A STAFF REPORTER																								In yet another case of eve-teasing on Park Street, teenager Tarun Sikdar was caught whistling at a 13-year-old girl in front of Allen Park, while she was walking back home after class.																								Officer-in-charge of Park Street police station Fayaz Khan said a sergeant on anti-crime patrol, Narottam Ghosh, was driving by on his motorcycle and witnessed the incident. He got off his vehicle, chased Sikdar and arrested him. We have booked him for eve-teasing. He will be produced in court on Wednesday, Khan said.																								Tuesdays incident was the fifth reported crime against women in Park Street in the past month-and-a-half. In all the incidents, Park Street and Shakespeare Sarani police stations managed to arrest the culprits. 																								Expressing concern over the rise in eve-teasing incidents, OC Fayaz Khan and his Shakespeare Sarani counterpart Subrata Ghosh said they had stepped up police patrolling in the area.																								Elaborating on Tuesdays incident, they said the girl, a Class V student of a local school, lives on Tiljala Road. She walks to school in the morning back home in the afternoon. Usually, she is accompanied by couple of her classmates. But on Tuesday afternoon, she was alone. She noticed a boy following her. He was whistling at me and singing songs, she told the police. 																								On sensing that the boy was trailing her, she began to walk faster. Police said a few passersby noticed them but did not protest. It was then that sergeant Narottam Ghosh of Park Street police station arrived on the scene. On spotting the policeman, Sikdar began to flee. Ghosh followed him and caught him by his collar.																								The 13-year-old girl was too stunned to react. With Sikdar in tow, Ghosh walked to the girl and asked her what was happening. The girl broke down while narrating how Sikdar was harrasing her. 																								Sikdar was brought to the police station for questioning. Investigations revealed that he works in a private catering agency on a contract. He claimed he was on his way to work but we are verifying his statements, an officer said.

 Monday, January 20, 2003 				 Multi-crore project for piped water
 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE 																								The government has taken up a comprehensive plan to ensure 100 per cent piped drinking water supply, to revamp the citys century-old sewerage system and improve road conditions. The CMDA will implement the Rs 1,700-crore project and the government is looking for foreign funds for it.																								Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday held a meeting with urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and CMDA officers and okayed the plan. He will approach different foreign agencies for funds.																								Officers say even after augmenting several projects, at least 20 per cent people in the city do not get piped water. The tubewell or deep tubewell is their only water source.																								Our move is aimed at providing piped drinking water to all the people in the city by the year 2010. We had discussions with some foreign agencies and financial institutions for funds and feel it will not be a major problem. It will take some more time to finalise the financier, Bhattacharya said.																								Mayor Subrata Mukherjee said construction of eight underground reservoirs in different areas and a water treatment plant of 20-million-gallons-a-day capacity at Palta were in progress and after its completion, Calcuttans will get piped water. But, he said, even then, it would be far from 100 per cent coverage. 																								To ensure this, more treatment plants and reservoirs are needed. New underground pipelines need to be laid. Calcutta Municipal Corporation has joined hands with the state government to do that, the mayor said. The minister added: All the major and arterial roads in the city will be repaired, widened and beautified. quot;

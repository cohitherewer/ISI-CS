 Thursday, January 30, 2003 				 World Cup blackout cloud lifts
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The cloud over World Cup crickets live television coverage reaching Calcutta cable homes hooked to the RPG Netcom feed lifted on Wednesday after a rapprochement reached with Sony Entertainment Television (SET) on connectivity.																								Top officials of the citys leading multi-system operator and Sony, which has exclusive satellite rights for India, thrashed out the numbers issue in Mumbai to clear the decks for uninterrupted beaming of crickets showpiece event.																								Yes, we have sorted out the declaration issue with RPG Netcom, and their viewers in Calcutta can surely enjoy the World Cup and all the other channels on our bouquet, Shantonu Aditya, president, SET-Discovery, confirmed from Mumbai.																								Aditya, however, clarified that talks on connectivity were still on with the other two service providers in Calcutta  SitiCable and Manthan  according to latest information from the ground. We have reached a consensus with part of the Siti network, but no agreement has yet been arrived at with Manthan, he said.																								The Sony official, however, hoped that everything would be sorted out before the tournament begins. We are not a network driven by a single event. SET-Discovery is a complete bouquet catering to multiple interest areas and we are here to build a long-term bridge with the viewers, Aditya said.

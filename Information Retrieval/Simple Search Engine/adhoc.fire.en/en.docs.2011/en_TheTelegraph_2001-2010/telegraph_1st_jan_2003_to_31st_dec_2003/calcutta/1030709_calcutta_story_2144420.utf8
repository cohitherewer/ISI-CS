	Construction work has been going on for some time to beautify  Howrah station and regulate traffic in and around it. But  no one is bothered about the harrowing experience commuters  go through to approach theHowrah bridge. The taxis and buses  add to the chaos. The entire stretch is also a stopping  place for vehicles. Add to this two auto stands, stands  for local and long distance buses and cycle rickshaws. This  leaves the daily commuters at the mercy of the Almighty.  It is surprising that the authorities turn a blind eye to  the problem.  
	K. Asokan, Howrah.  
	The manhole cover at the crossing of Raja Dinendra Street  and Vivekananda Road has been missing for almost a fortnight.  Some good samaritan has put a bamboo stick in the open hole.  The road gets waterlogged even after a small shower, and  it is dangerous for pedestrians. The civic authorities should  take immediate steps to prevent any untoward incident.  
	Kalyan Ray Choudhuri, Maniktola.

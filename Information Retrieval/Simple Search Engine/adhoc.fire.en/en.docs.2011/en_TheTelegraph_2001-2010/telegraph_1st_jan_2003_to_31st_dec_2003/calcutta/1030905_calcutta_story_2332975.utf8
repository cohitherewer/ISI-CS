Indian classical music is all about preserving and propagating the Parampara (tradition) of a particular gharana (lineage). Shishyas are trained by Gurus to carry on the mantle of respective gharana. Sandipan Samajpati is a talented vocalist of the Kirana gharana who began his musical journey at the tender age of five under the tutelage of Pandit Manas Chakraborty. A diligent pupil with a mellifluous voice, it did not take long for Samajpati to master the intricacies of Hindustani classical music. A rare cerebral approach combined with his craving for perfection gives his music a rare dimension. Since his debut at the age of 16, Samajpati has been performing in a number of prestigious music conferences throughout India and abroad. His presentation of Khayal and Thumri are resplendent in their own hues as he intelligently assimilates and improvises elements from other gharanas including Gwalior, Sahaswan, Vishnupur and Benaras and almost manages to establish an independent gharana. His systematic and soul-stirring strains of swarvistaar and graceful and gliding Sur-lagav aligns him to the Kirana Gharana expounded by Abdul Karim Khan, but his music also bears the influence of the other and more contemporary stream of the Kirana represented by Amir Khan, which is marked by greater austerity, restraint and method in slow exposition. Samajpatis originality clearly distinguishes him from many of his contemporaries. Jalsaghars Uttarsuri (torch-bearer) programme features this young vocalist tomorrow.

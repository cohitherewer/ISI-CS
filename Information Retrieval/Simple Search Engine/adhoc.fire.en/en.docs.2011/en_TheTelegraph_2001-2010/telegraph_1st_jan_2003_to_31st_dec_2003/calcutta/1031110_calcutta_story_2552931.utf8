																								Rosencratz and Guilderstern belong to Shakespeares Hamlet, two minor lords and Hamlets cronies who know little about their own fates or roles in the greater scheme of things. Tom Stoppard wrote this play about a couple of bewildered innocents who are trapped in a world that is beyond their comprehension. This play has been built around Stoppards, an interpretation, as it were. In this story, Guilderstern is a woman and Rosencratz is a young homosexual, both trying desperately to make sense of the rules of the world they have been excluded from. They are a part of our world  lost, bewildered, naive, yet utterly convinced of their own undeniable importance. The Player enters their world  a swaggering dude, a performer, an artiste who sells to the open market  sexual, inviting, and consumer savvy. Theatrons latest production has Trina Nileena Banerjee making her directorial debut.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Gyan Manch

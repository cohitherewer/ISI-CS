The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, November 04, 2003  12 to a German jamboree
 Three weeks may not be a whole lot  of time to soak in the sights of a whole country, but that  didnt stop Saloni Lihala and 11 other Calcutta-based  students from trying their best on a recent exchange programme  to Germany. The 17-year-old student in Class XI, Mahadevi  Birla Girls High School, writes of the awesome experience. Beyond barriers:  The Calcutta contingent in Germany with a new friend.  (Above) A view of Munich during Oktoberfest (AFP)  It was 21 days of fun for the  12 of us who set off for Germany as part of the Rotary Youth  Exchange programme. From September 26 to October 17, the  group, selected through interviews from across the city,  gathered some unforgettable memories. We were all students from schools  and colleges in Calcutta, including La Martiniere, Modern  High and Jadavpur University. We were to be hosted by 12  different families, whose children are to come here in December.  This was the perfect opportunity for an exchange of views  and to get to know a people and its culture. After our arrival, on September  27, the Rotarians of Germany organised a welcome programme  at a school where the 12 host kids study. On September 29,  we visited the biggest festival organised in the country,  the popular Oktoberfest, where we had a blast on the awesome  roller-coaster rides. On September 30, we went to Zugspitze,  the highest mountain peak in Germany, which is also the  border point between Germany and Austria. The snow was beautiful  and the best part about it was that we got to throw around  snowballs! On October 6, we visited the Audi car museum,  which took us down the ages through the evolution of the  vehicle. The very next day (October 7),  we visited the biggest BMW factory in the world. From the  creation of the smallest parts to the finishing touches,  we got a glimpse behind the scenes of the making of this  amazing vehicle. On October 9, we got a chance to tour the  beautiful city of Salzburg in neighbouring Austria (remember  The Sound of Music?). After that, we spent a full  day at a German school, sitting through some of the classes  our hosts take. The last week of the trip included visits  to some historic castles and museums. The most beautiful  point was undoubtedly the castle of Nymphenburg. On the  very same day we watched an ice-hockey game at the Olympic  Sports Area in Munich, which was great fun. Weekdays were spent touring, while  weekends were family days, spent exclusively with our hosts.  When it was our chance to do something to entertain our  hosts, we put up a cultural show and cooked Indian food,  which everyone thought was very delicious. There were some really surprising  facts about Germany  beer is cheaper than water, people  prefer to drink soda instead of water and every citizen  follows traffic rules without anyone forcing them to! And  though most of the students knew enough English to communicate  with us, many of the elders knew none at all. We are now waiting for the 12  guests from Germany to visit our city from December 20 to  January 7.  Trips to Puri, Raichak, Nicco  Park, Swabhumi whatever we eventually pack in, it is sure  to be straight from the heart. Tintin: All-time favourite French connection Did you know a series of six books  by Swiss author Rudolf Toppfer published in 1827 were the  first comics that the world saw? Or that the Tintin stories  written by Herg before the World War I later came out in  new versions after editing the politically risqu parts?  Such interesting trivia came to  light at an interface with French publisher Jacques Binsztock  organised by Alliance Francaise de Calcutta at Oxford Bookstore  on Saturday. Binsztock is in charge of Seuil Images, which  specialises in childrens literature. It was childhood revisited for  the audience as Binsztock traced childrens literature from  Daniel Defoes Robinson Crusoe, Jonathan Swifts  Gullivers Travels, Grimm Brothers fairy tales to  more recent names like Rudyard Kiplings Jungle Book.  All of them were written for adult readers but later became  popular with children, he pointed out. The publisher went  on to show how the moral divides of society were reflected  in childrens literature down the ages. The first heroes  came to being with the birth of magazines in early 20th  Century. There was the Les Pieds Nickeles series  on three reckless youngsters who robbed the rich and gave  to the poor. At the same time, there came to being Becassine,  a conservative heroine who went to church and was very nave.  There is a moralist section among publishers of childrens  literature even today, he said. This is especially true  in the US where they censor pictures in childrens books,  he added, much to the amusement of the listeners. Earlier, people in the trade  thought childrens books beyond 200 pages wont sell, as  kids have small brains infested with TV. Then came Harry  Potter, he laughed, pointing to the 700-page J.K. Rowling  tome placed on the bookstores racks. France now brings out more than  6,000 titles for children every year and is a focal point  of international trade in the area. But unfortunately Indian  tales do not figure on the list. Seuil Images brought out  a Feluda thriller, but that did not do well. Satyajit  Ray is known more as a filmmaker in our country, he explained. But Binsztock is shopping for  more titles on his trip to India. The publisher has already  bought a book of folk tales from Chennai, entitled A  Very Angry Lion, which will find its way to the French  market in a translated version. I am looking for more books,  he said. Festive high November 1 saw students from 13  schools have a blast at Amigo 2003, the annual fest organised  by the Interact Club of Don Bosco Park Circus. A grand inauguration started it  all, with first lady, Anjanaben Shah, principal secretary,  higher education, J. Sircar and director, WBREDA, S.P. Gonchoudhari,  in attendance. MTV VJ Ramona, the anchor, took the stage  to thunderous applause. The show kicked off with Ami-Cine  where each school was given a movie and the choice of a  scene to enact. Then Ami-Knockout, a medley of events, took  place, taking turns with rounds including quiz, antakshari,  and dumb charades. The DJ contest was a crowd puller, in  which Kushal Bengani of the home school emerged winner,  followed by a pro, DJ Tanveer, showing the way with a bunch  of remixes. Amigo saw a full house for Nrityanaatak,  a mixture of dance and drama. Each school performed wonderfully,  with La Martinere for Boys deserving special mention. While  the round was on, the Interact Club donated a TV to the  NGO it has adopted, Siddharth United. Trendz, the fashion  show, was theme-based, with schools having to work in concepts  like states of India, sportswear and movies. Later, Neeraj  Kalra gave a presentation on the activities of the Interact  Club of the school. The guest performer was the home-grown  Yash Himani of Don Bosco, who has performed in over 200  shows across India with Usha Uthup and Sunidhi Chauhan.  He got the crowd on its feet with his magic on the synthesiser,  followed by a performance by Rahul Pandey from St Xaviers. Finally, Don Bosco Liluah came  in first, followed by Queen of the Mission and Ashok Hall.   Siddhartha Saraogi,

Picture by Aranya Sen So long, farewell For all the people associated  with St Thomas Girls School, October 31 was an emotional  day. For it was principal U. Andrews last day in office,  ending six years of dedicated service. The ceremony, held on the school  premises was attended by the members of the school board  of governors as well as chairman Neil OBrien, Reverend  Yardy from St Pauls Cathedral, the principal and vice-principal  of St Thomas Boys School, and staff, students and boarders  from St Thomas Girls School. An Odissi flower dance by two  students was followed by an opening speech by school captain  Christine Massey. Several school and board functionaries  spoke of their experiences working alongside Mrs Andrews.  The senior girls performed a Gujarati dance while Maressa  Anthony spoke on behalf of the boarders. Under the able leadership of Ms  Andrews, St. Thomas Girls School has taken great leaps  forward. Her guiding spirit will remain with the school.  On Monday, S. Bhattacharya, formerly with Pratt Memorial,  joined as our new principal. There was more action on campus,  with the Interact Club of the school holding its installation  ceremony on October 29 at the school auditorium. Last years  activities  including 135 different programmes, big and  small  were summed up. Christine Massey, also the school  captain, took over the reigns as the club president.  Madhumita Das,

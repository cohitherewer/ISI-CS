				 																																										Mayor Subrata Mukherjee has urged Union labour minister Sahib Singh Verma to lower the minimum age of labour from 18 years to 14 years. He has also called for a check on indiscriminate disinvestment of public sector undertakings to improve the employment scenario in the country. Mukherjee was addressing a conference on Monday organised jointly by the South Asia advisory team of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Council of Indian Employers (CIE). The conference was attended by Kari Tapiola, executive director, ILO, Geneva. 				 																																										A promoter was arrested on Monday in Salt Lake on charges of fraud and assault on the representatives of a private bank. The promoter, a resident of Salt Lakes BF block, took a loan from ICICI Bank to purchase an air-conditioner, police said. The promoter had, allegedly, earlier cheated several IAS and IPS officers of Salt Lake. The promoter took over Rs 14 lakh from a doctor of SSKM Hospital this year promising him a flat. On the day of delivery, he took the doctor to an incomplete building, an officer said.				 																																										Calcutta Municipal Corporation has offered four sites to the state irrigation department to dump the silt being scooped out from the Beleghata canal and Tollys Nullah. City drainage chief Rajiv Deb said the silt would be utilised as landfill material at the Bhatshal burial ground in Garden Reach and the low-lying areas of the Dhapa area.				 																																										A professional tax enrolment-cum-trade licence camp will be held for ward 66 at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation pumphouse, 85, Topsia Road, on Tuesday.				 																																										Three buses on routes 202 and 30B were damaged and Dum Dum Road was blocked by the local auto-rickshaw union from 10 am to 12.30 pm on Monday, following a clash between members of the union and some bus workers. The problem started when a private bus did not allow an auto-rickshaw on the Nagerbazar-Dum Dum route to overtake it. As the bus reached the station area, the autorickshaw driver stopped the bus and union members attacked it. A few buses coming on the same route were also damaged.				 																																										An eight-member delegation from the Ho Chi Minh City Women Union met speaker Hashim Abdul Halim on Monday. The womens delegation team from Vietnam, led by Thin Mein Nogueth, will discuss several issues related to the two cities during its stay. The team will meet industrialists and visit several industrial units of the city.				 																																										Residents of Muragachha blocked the railway tracks in the Sealdah section, demanding that the Down Lalgola Passenger stop at every station after Naihati. As a result, train services in the section came to a halt from 6.55 am to 8 am, causing cancellation of several passenger trains. Later, residents of Ultadanga blocked the tracks of Circular Railway for an hour to demand a gateman at the Ultadanga Patipukur level crossing.				 																																										The city civic authorities deferred their drive against Benfish stalls at the last moment on Monday evening as the food firm informed the CMC that it would clear its dues, amounting to Rs 7 lakh, on Tuesday. According to mayor Subrata Mukherjee, the drive against a private telecom company will continue as it has not paid visual tax. 				 																																										 A rap on the knuckles by the government and pressure from broadcasters have sent stubborn cable operators scurrying to raise money from the ground. With payment from operators drying up, RPG Netcom had apprised the state home secretary of the situation to pre-empt a switch-off by broadcasters, particularly during the World Cup. Agitating operators, summoned by the vigilance and enforcement department of Calcutta Police on Monday, have promised to clear dues at old rates by end-February.

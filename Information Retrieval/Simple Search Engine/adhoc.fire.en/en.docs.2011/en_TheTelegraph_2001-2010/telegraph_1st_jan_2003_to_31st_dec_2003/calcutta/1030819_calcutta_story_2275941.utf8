 Tuesday, August 19, 2003 				 College retains waterline, shop vats shifted
 A STAFF REPORTER																								The taps are safe at Presidency College. The state public works department (PWD) has told municipal commissioner Debasis Som that it has taken steps for early payment of the colleges property tax dues, amounting to Rs 1 crore. Accordingly, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) has decided not to snap the colleges waterlines.																								The conservancy department has also removed the garbage vats from the entrance of Pantaloons, on Gariahat Road, after Mayur Sales Company, which owns the building, coughed up Rs 65 lakh as the first instalment of the total dues of Rs 3.44 crore. 																								But water supply to the building, disconnected by the CMC under police protection on Saturday, was not restored. We will not restore supply and repair the pavements abutting the retail outlet till they shell out Rs 1 crore, as directed by the court, said mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Monday. The waterline would not have been snapped and the garbage vats would not have been placed there if they had not assaulted civic employees, said mayoral council member (conservancy) Rajib Deb. 																								The CMC had intentionally placed the vats and excavated the pavement in front of the shop as a retaliatory measure after the shops security men assaulted the civic officials who went there to snap the water supply on Saturday. Two securitymen were arrested on the basis of an FIR lodged by the CMC.																								On Monday afternoon, the mayor gave his green light to the water supply department to seal the deep tubewell in the CIT building on 2, Lu Shun Sarani, in Poddar Court, as it has not paid Rs 4.73 crore by way of property tax. The CMC had earlier snapped the filtered-water connection to the building.																								Two months ago, assistant assessor and collector (headquarters) Sabyasachi Dey had submitted a list of 134 property-tax defaulters to the municipal commissioner. The total outstanding from them is over Rs 75 crore.																								Of these, the mayor short-listed 12 premises, with property tax dues of Rs 20 crore, and gave it to the water supply department two months ago to take penal action if the owners failed to pay up their dues. 																								The CIT building at 2, Lu Shun Sarani, topped the list of defaulters. Its outstanding property tax is Rs 4.73 crore. An ayurvedic hospital at 2, Ramgopal Ghosh Road, has the lowest outstanding at Rs 58 lakh.																								Accordingly, the civic water supply department served water-disconnection notices on the 12 premises and snapped the supply lines to 10 of them till Thursday. 																								Only the building at 2, Brabourne Road was spared, after the owner shelled out Rs 13 lakh. No action could be taken against premises No. 27/1, Cossipore Road. It could not be located.

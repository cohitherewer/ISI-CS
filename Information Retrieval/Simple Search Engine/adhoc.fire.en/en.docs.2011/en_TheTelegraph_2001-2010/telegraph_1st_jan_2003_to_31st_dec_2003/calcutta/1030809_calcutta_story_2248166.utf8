 Saturday, August 09, 2003 				 Riot act for puja pandals
 A STAFF REPORTER																								With less than two months to go for the Pujas, the city police read out the riot act to 172 puja committees that erect pandals by blocking roads. In a notice issued by the office of the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), the puja committees were directed to refrain from doing so this year. 																								After conducting an inquiry, police identified these puja organisers, who block streets and roads for erecting their pandals. This time, we have informed them much before the Pujas, and they will have to change the spot where they erect their pandals, said an officer at Lalbazar. 																								Police have already stipulated that idol-makers restrict the height of the goddess to not more than 10 ft. The CESC has also been instructed to ensure power supply during the Pujas.

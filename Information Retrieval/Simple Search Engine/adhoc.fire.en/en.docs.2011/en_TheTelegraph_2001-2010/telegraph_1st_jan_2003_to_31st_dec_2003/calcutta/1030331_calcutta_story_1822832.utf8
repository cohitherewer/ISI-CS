				 																																									A  huge amount of electricity is wasted on Vidyasagar Setu every  day. Lamps on the bridge are seldom switched off. Electric  fuse boxes, near the toll-collection building, are in a dangerous  condition and can drag anyone into an accident any moment.  During the monsoon, the loose wires are often the reason behind  deaths by electrocution. The state electricity board must  check such waste. 
 Sumant Poddar, Kyd Street. 				 																																									Vegetable  vendors who sit every evening near the Ultadanga station dump  refuse in the adjoining areas. The spot is also used as a  toilet. The civic body should take steps. 
 Diptimoy Ghosh, Salt Lake.

The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Friday, September 26, 2003  Up against a wall of apathy
 Metro Matters / Uttam Sengupta Students of Apeejay School out on an inspection of public  toilets as part of a social initiative  With Calcuttans hitting the streets  for pre-Puja shopping and millions expected to pour out  during Puja, the absence of toilets is being felt even more  acutely Two kinds of people  those who  do not have to travel and those who seldom have to walk  the street  will find it difficult to appreciate the value  of decent, dry, clean, bright, well-ventilated and functional  public toilets.  The few public toilets that this  city has (only 130 set up reportedly by the Calcutta Municipal  Corporation as opposed to the 5,000 public toilets for men  and 200 for women in New Delhi) stink and suffer from design  and construction flaws besides poor maintenance. Wet and  overflowing loos, with no place to change your clothes or  to keep your belongings, are not quite inviting. Most  of the urinals in Indias urban jungles are actually bare  walls with a pit to drain into a hole in the ground.  The initiative by students of  Apeejay School to inspect regularly the public toilets  in the city and report on them, therefore, is welcome no  doubt but is just not enough. The CMC cannot shirk its own  responsibility and will have to do a lot more than lip-service. The absence of decent public toilets  forces people, specially the women, the old and the children,  to cut down on travelling. Going out for long hours is ruled  out and this cramps their lifestyle. Thats why public toilets  are increasingly being accorded an importance that they  did not receive earlier.  Acknowledging that public toilets  is a necessity in every civilised society, Australia came  out with a National Public Toilet Map in 2001, giving details  of over 13,000 such toilets, some of which are meant for  the physically disabled or the visually impaired. Roadmaps  in the United States routinely provide such information  and there is apparently a British Toilet Association, which  campaigns for improvement in public toilets. In Calcutta, as in most Indian  cities, it is of course a familiar sight to find men urinating  against public walls of all kinds, which afford them some  privacy. But the sight recently of three young men, standing  10 feet apart from each other on the opposite side of the  imposing Grand Hotel was both annoying and embarassing.  Annoying because a visitor to the city smilingly asked why  the CMC cannot provide basic facilities. It was also embarassing  because the traffic had come to a standstill behind the  young men and hundreds of eyes nonchalantly bore into their  back from buses and cars and watched them. The young men  however looked intently up to the sky and were oblivious  to everything else.  With Calcuttans hitting the street  for pre-Puja shopping , and millions expected to pour out  during the Puja itself, the absence of public toilets will  be felt even more acutely in the city. Neither much thought  nor much planning appears to have gone into this essential  public service. It is not just Park Street, as pointed out  by the students of Apeejay School, but several busy sections  of the city, where public toilets are either non-existent  or are just not visible enough.  The metro requires toilets of  different kinds. Slums must be provided with functional,  self-sustaining and utilitarian models; the business district  requires clean and decent urinals while for those who can  afford it, there should also be what the students in their  enthusiasm have described as five-star toilets. Most well-heeled  visitors will not mind shelling out as much as Rs 100 for  an hour, if only they can change clothes, shave and have  their bath etc, without worrying about where to keep the  wallets. There are several other trends  which are worth noting. Civic bodies even in this country  are increasingly paying attention to small details like  public toilets actually scaring children. The Pune municipality,  for example, has encouraged the construction of separate  public toilets for children, while Japan has been relentlessly  promoting brainy bathrooms and hi-tech loos. Inspired  by automated toilets, innovators have even come up with  a design for an overseat which makes it unnecessary to  sit on public toilets- depending instead on clamps that  help grip the waist and lower people just over the toilet.  A Japanese company has promoted the Otohime, a radio-like  machine that reproduces sound of running water and drowns  other sounds. Whats more, there is increasing  evidence that public toilets can not only generate employment  but also wealth. The example of Bindeshwar Pathak, founder  of Sulabh International, is a case in point. Arguably the  shit king of the country, Pathak lives in New Delhis  posh Panchsheel Park, moves in a Merc ( just one of the  many cars that he has in his stable), runs a Rs 100 crore  empire and employs (most of them voluntary social workers)  around 50,000 people. The man has also set up a toilet  museum and a sanitation institute besides emerging as an  international authority on public sanitation. His critics  hate his guts and accuse him of shamelessly making money  in the name of social service. He himself nonchalantly  claims that he has earned it all and indicates that others  too could copy his model, that is if they are able to. At a seminar in Hong Kong, Pathak  pointed out that India had to deal with 900 million litres  of urine and 135 million kg of faecal matter every day.  In addition, millions of litres of water are required to  flush them.  The mans current obsession is  to recycle this water for acquaculture and to find out a  viable model to use the waste to generate bio-gas. Calcutta,  the teeming metropolis, has a lot to learn from his experience.

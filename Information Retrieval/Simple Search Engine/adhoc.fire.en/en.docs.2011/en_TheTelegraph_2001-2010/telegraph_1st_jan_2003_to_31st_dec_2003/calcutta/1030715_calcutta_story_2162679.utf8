The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, July 15, 2003 				 Travels in hyper-reality
																								The on-going exhibition of paintings at Gallery Caps is a landmark event indeed: it showcases rare contemporary Indian art in a balanced, coherent manner. The focus of this show is on the contemporary art scene, to perceive the significant strands in its development and to view the emerging language against a broad perspective. In the last 50 years, there has been a shift into a critique of a post-colonial situation which is neo-colonial, our conflicts do not burn into great conflagrations, do not boil over into major theoretical crises. Rather, the conflicts simmer, percolate, sputter out and heat up again and produce an inexorable ennui. A profound spiritual fatigue weighs upon the most lyrical, most spontaneously animated of our artistic productions without suggesting a geographically locatable uniqueness.... Participants include Shyamal Dutta Roy, Suhas Roy, Prokash Karmakar, Robin Mondal, Ganesh Haloi, Wasim Kapoor, Aditya Basak, Subrata Gangopadhyay and Ashoke Mullick.																								When: Till August 3 (except Sundays); 11.30 am - 7.30 pm																								Where: Gallery Caps, 16 Jatin Bagchi Road, Calcutta 700 029

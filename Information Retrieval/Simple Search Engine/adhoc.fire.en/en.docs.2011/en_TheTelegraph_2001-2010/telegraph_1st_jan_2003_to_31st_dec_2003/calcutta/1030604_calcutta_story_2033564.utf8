The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion
		 Wednesday, June 04, 2003  Arjun chakraborty								Actor 																																							House-owners should be penalised if they give shelter to unwanted elements. You should know who you are renting your house to. This is necessary not only for your own security but also for that of the community. Once people start giving information to the police, the infrastructure for monitoring will also fall in place. A court might be set up to deal with those who fail to furnish information. People in high ranks should be particularly careful as their houses are perceived as the safest shelters by miscreants.

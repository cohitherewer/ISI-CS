		 Wednesday, November 12, 2003 				 																				soumitra majumdar,								Chief public relations officer, Eastern Railway																																							The replacement of the old route-relay interlocking (RRI) system was an absolute necessity as it had exceeded its life. While the previous RRI had the capacity to handle 650 routes and 148 signals, the present one can handle 1,134 routes and 174 signals, thus increasing the flexibility of simultaneous train movements. The running time between Liluah and Howrah on an average has also dropped by two minutes, under normal conditions. The period for which trains have to wait outside Howrah has been reduced considerably. The odd problem occurs only when there is a bunching of trains.

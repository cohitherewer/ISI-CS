The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Tuesday, July 08, 2003 				 Sharadiya Shahjahan
																								When clusters of white clouds drift along the blue sky, when the blossoming kaash in the field becomes the harbinger of autumn, when the strains of Aagomoni presage the festive season, then, like the rest of Bengal, village Madhukhali, too, prepares to embrace the festivities with the revival of the states own tradition of theatre. Every year, the Rakshits of Madhukhali would stage the play, Shahjahan, at their Nat-Mandir on the Ashtami evening of Durga Puja. This year, Sourendra, the dandy NRI son of the Rakshits, has invited a number of American sahibs  his office bosses  to witness the traditional Durga Puja. Besides, he has also organised a musical extravaganza featuring some of Mumbais leading artistes. Sasadhar, the family karta (head) is, however, opposed to this musical show. Its further revealed that Sourendra had surreptitiously planned to sell off his share of the Nat-Mandir and settle abroad. He is prepared to resort to any unscupulous means to achieve his goals. Side by side, a resistance builds up to save the tradition. This Ekush Shatak production is written and directed by Shyamal Chakraborty.																								When: Today at 6.30 pm																								Where: Rabindra Sadan

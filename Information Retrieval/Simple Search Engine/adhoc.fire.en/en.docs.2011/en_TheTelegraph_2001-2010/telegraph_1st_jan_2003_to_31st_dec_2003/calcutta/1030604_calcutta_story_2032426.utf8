The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Wednesday, June 04, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	North Calcutta may witness a revival of commercial theatre  once Star Theatre starts operating in full swing. The government  can consider revamping a few other theatres as well. Quite  a few of them are rented out for weddings. Theatre-lovers  of the city still yearn for the good old days.  
	Rabindranath Kar, Sankar Ghosh Lane.  
	There are no lights on Kyd Street, a vital connecting road  for the fire brigade, police and convoy of ministers visiting  the MLA Hostel or the state guest-house. After dark, miscreants  throng the area and it has become quite unsafe to walk down  the road. The CESC must find out if there is a fault in  the electricity connection.  
	Sumant Poddar, Kyd Street.  
	The clogged underground sewers at the Tobin Road-BT Road  crossing need to be cleaned before the monsoon sets in. 
	 Rakesh Verma, Dunlop Bridge.

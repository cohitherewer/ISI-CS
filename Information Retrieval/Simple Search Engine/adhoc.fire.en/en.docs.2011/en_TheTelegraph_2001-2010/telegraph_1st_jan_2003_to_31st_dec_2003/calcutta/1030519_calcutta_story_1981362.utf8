The Telegraph - Calcutta
 Monday, May 19, 2003  Calcutta Column
 
	On any auspicious occasion, the national flag is hoisted  on prominent government offices and private institutes.  Even during the World Cup, all streets of Calcutta had long  yards of the Tricolour hanging from lamposts and hoardings.  But once the occasion is over, no one bothers to remove  the flag or replace it with a new one even after it becomes  discoloured and torn. What impression do tourists get? 
	 Jyoti Baksi, Heysham Row.  
	The Netaji Bhavan Metro station is a painful exception  to the cleanliness prevailing at the other stations. Garbage  accumulates and people urinate below the portrait of Netaji  outside.  
	Gunjeet S. Wadhwa, Rai Bahadur Road.

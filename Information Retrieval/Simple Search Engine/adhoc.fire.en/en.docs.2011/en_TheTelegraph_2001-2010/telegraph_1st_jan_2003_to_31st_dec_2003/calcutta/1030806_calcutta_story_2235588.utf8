 A STAFF REPORTER																								Students of Calcutta Universitys (CU) radiophysics and electronics department have launched an agitation against a teacher for allegedly awarding unexpectedly low marks in two papers of the B.Tech finals.																								Led by the Students Federation of India (SFI), students lodged complaints with vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee and threatened to take up the matter with higher authorities if action was not taken against Samir Kumar Dey, the teacher. Many of us have been given zero in the two papers, while several others have scored between two and six, said a student. Banerjee refused comment on the matter.

 A STAFF REPORTER																								Ajit Kumar Roy, in his 70s, and wife Pushpa, 62, displayed exemplary courage on Monday morning when they warded off two youths, armed with a pistol and a chopper, although Roy was bleeding profusely after the attack. 																								Wielding a cricket wicket, Roy hit out at the young men who had barged into their flat. Pushpa chased one of them for 50 metres down crowded S.P. Mukherjee Road. 																								Roy is the producer of a series of hit Bengali films, such as Parinita and Bhola Moira.																								Later, Pushpa said: It was around 11.30 am. My husband had returned from the market 15 minutes earlier and I was preparing breakfast. The main gate was unlocked. Then I saw two young men standing on the verandah. Before I could realise anything, they had entered the drawing room and switched off the lights. They seemed to be familiar with the room, she said.																								One of the youths took out a pistol and warned Pushpa against shouting. He tried to snatch my gold chain. Sensing trouble, I gave him the chain worth Rs 20,000. Soon, he pinned me down on the floor, she said.																								The other man, armed with a chopper, entered the dining room, where Roy was having his breakfast. As I shouted, he started hitting me with the chopper. He aimed at my throat. Somehow, I managed to move my head and the chopper slashed my neck, said Roy, looking shaken four hours after the incident.																								The other youth dragged Pushpa to the dining space. He snatched her gold bangle. Then Roys assailant turned his attention to Pushpa. Roy, who was bleeding, picked up a cricket wicket kept in one corner.																								I started hitting out with the wicket while screaming for help. One of the youths tried to snatch the stick but failed. They ran out, recalled Roy.																								Pushpa said: As they left my house, I chased one of them. One ran towards Russa Road. I chased the other, hurrying towards S.P. Mukherjee Road. Hearing my screams, my neighbours came out, but the youths had disappeared.																								Tollygunge police station officials and the detective departments dacoity wing visited the spot.
